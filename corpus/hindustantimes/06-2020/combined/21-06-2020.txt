He emphatically stated that “We will get our growth back” once Unlock 1.0 commenced and greater relaxations kicked in. It seems he had in mind a V-shaped, ie, a quick recovery. He explained that his confidence was based on his trust in the capabilities and intellect of India, and the fact that the reforms undertaken recently by his government were systemic. At a time of national dejection, if not despair, the words of a leader have a role in instilling self-belief in the population. But unless they are accompanied by concrete action, they will not amount to much. The sparkling speeches of Winston Churchill may have encouraged his people when Britain was attacked during World War II. But they were unlikely to have sufficed had the United States not intervened. Presumably, the analogy will not be lost on the PM as he uses the metaphor of war when characterising the necessary response to Covid-19. In this context, it is his government that would be expected to act, not the industrialists whom he had exhorted to do so in his address. One can go further and state that, right now, the private sector cannot do much on its own to get growth back. To appreciate why the government is central, it needs to be understood that in an economy with excess capacity, income is determined by the expenditure on goods or “aggregate demand”. When an economy has been shocked into a lower level of activity, it could well remain there, unless aggregate demand revives. For aggregate demand to revive, there has to be investment. To understand this, think of demand as having two parts, namely consumption and investment. Consumption is largely determined by income, and cannot rise unless the latter does so first. Right now, in India, income is depressed due to the economic shock. On the other hand, investment is not constrained by income and can be fuelled by credit. With greater investment, aggregate demand rises, and as a consequence so does production or income. But private investment, though based on expectation of the future, is at least partly driven by its current state. So, with output depressed by a 68-day-long lockdown, private investment, and thus growth, could be held back even after the lockdown is lifted. The PM is optimistic when he expresses confidence that we will get our growth back. Fortunately, economic reasoning shows a way out of the present situation. This is that the government should raise aggregate demand, preferably through investment, to take the economy back to where it was in late March. Again, in his address to the members of CII, the PM spoke of the growth potential of the reforms implemented by his government, especially in agriculture. These are needed and significant but they are aimed at the supply side of the economy while the problem today is a demand shortfall. We see this all around us in the economy — when shopkeepers in Mumbai speak of how their daily sales are, on average, a quarter of what they were before the lockdown, and when migrant workers, having reached their homes in Odisha by sea, speak of returning to Chennai in search of work. So, a shortage of demand for goods and labour is what is at stake, and a stimulus alone can address it. The economic package announced by the finance minister in mid-May was not a stimulus, as it does not inject demand into the economy. Greater public spending alone can do that at the present juncture. But, for some reason the government has shied away from undertaking it.Finally, the PM stressed that getting growth back is not so difficult as now Indian industry has a clearly defined goal in Aatmanirbhar Bharat. This is intriguing. Of what help can a declaration of independence can be to Indian industry is not clear. The point is that self-reliance is often neither possible nor desirable to a firm. In a modern economy, one firm is dependent on others for its inputs. Some of these are unavailable on the market. These are the producer services vital for efficient production. We may term these collectively as infrastructure. Physical infrastructure encompasses electricity, water supply, roads, and industrial waste management among other inputs. The huge initial investment necessary to supply these producer services and the fact that some of them are public goods, and therefore, unlikely to be provided by the private sector, leaves it to the government to provide them if we are to have an economy that generates wealth and creates jobs while doing so. For India’s producers, Atmanirbhar Bharat will remain just another slogan as long as a supportive eco-system does not exist. A recovery post-lockdown would require the government to pull out all stops. For this, the PM would have rethink his maxims. There are times when “maximum governance” means maximum government. It is not too late to stimulate India’s economy.Pulapre Balakrishnan is professor of Ashoka University, SonipatThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/to-revive-the-economy-modi-must-turn-to-maximum-government/story-rXGvnOQKUWz9qKa1oodubP.html

According to district health officials, the issue of a testing laboratory for Ghaziabad district had cropped up in a video conference meeting, which was chaired by the Uttar Pradesh chief minister.Till Sunday, Ghaziabad could collect only 15,578 samples for Covid-19 test, which is not even 1% of its estimated population of 42 lakh. The officials said that during his visit in April, Sudhir Garg, UP principal secretary (forest), had directed the district administration to prepare a proposal for setting up of a testing lab.“We are now searching for a suitable building where the RT-PCR lab can come up. During a recent video conferencing, chief minister directed for a need of a testing lab at Ghaziabad considering the high number of cases and time consumed for receiving the test reports. We will soon submit a proposal to Ghaziabad district magistrate and it will later be sent to the state government,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.Presently, the Ghaziabad health department has achieved only about 350 samples per day. The district has reported a steep rise in the number of Covid-19 positive cases as well as deaths due to the virus.Recently, the UP government-appointed nodal officers had visited the district and focussed primarily on the rising number of death cases. They have also directed officials to study every death case and find out reasons for spike in fatalities.“According to our assessment, 23 deaths have taken place in Meerut. Of them, about 70% cases were referred from Ghaziabad while rest of the patients got admitted on their own. Prima facie, as per our assessment, there could be delay in identification of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). This led to late detection of Covid-19 complications. The delay in identifying Covid-19 cases at an early stage can also be attributed to patients who fail to approach health care facilities when symptoms arrive,” CMO said.Therefore, the district health department has decided to speed up and enhance the surveillance systems through 260 teams. However, the officials said that they would require about 1,000-1,200 teams to cater to the existing population comprehensively.The aim of surveillance teams is to early detect the ILI and SARI patients so that they can be administered immediate treatment before anyone goes to complicated state, the officials said.Meanwhile, the Covid-19 cases in the district refused to show a decline.The health department officials on Sunday said that 65 more Covid-19 cases were added to the tally of 853, taking the total positive cases to 918 in the district. On Sunday, four more deaths were reported, which took the tally of fatalities to 46.“The 65 new cases have come from different localities in Ghaziabad and this is the highest single day spike till date. Four deaths have also taken place. One death has taken place in Ghaziabad, while three deaths which took place in Meerut earlier, were also added to the tally,” CMO added.According to the officials, the list of 65 new cases include five cases from the Women’s Hospital while two cases have also come in from the Dasna district jail.“The five positive cases from our hospital are staff nurses and ANMs who come from Khoda, Delhi and Noida. None of the doctors have tested positive so far,” said Dr Deepa Tyagi, chief medical superintendent of Women’s Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-plans-rt-pcr-test-lab-to-enhance-testing-district-records-biggest-single-day-spike-with-65-new-cases/story-CbymZjjMeio8TIhTRO7udO.html

My mother-in-law sustained some minor injuries in the incident, but she is doing better now,” Rohit Seth, the flat occupant said. He said the family immediately alerted the society’s management about the collapse, but have not reported the incident to the police so far.Residents of the society alleged that this is the second such incident to happen in the last few days.“Just a few days ago, a portion of the external plaster collapsed in a flat on the 14th floor. Luckily, no one was injured when it fell down on the ground. Both the two incidents could have resulted in a major tragedy. This building was built only four years ago and such incidents go on to show poor quality of construction. We are planning to take this matter forward by complaining to officials. The issue needs to be highlighted as this poses a direct risk to the safety of the residents,” Achal Rohit, member of the high-rises’ Apartment Owners’ Association, said.The builder said the collapse was not a result of any structural damage and the ceiling is being repaired.“Gaur City 5 was completed and handed over almost six years ago. Sunday’s incident is a one-off but an unfortunate incident.The plaster that had fallen down is part of a POP ceiling design and requires timely maintenance. The maintenance team immediately reached the flat after the incident and have already started the repairing work. We are doing all the necessary checks. After checking we have found that it was not a structural damage, it is just the POP(Plaster of Paris) which had fallen and we are in the process of repairing it,” a Gaur City spokesperson said.Reports of such collapses have been reported from several high-rises across the district in the last month.On May 27, a seven-year-old boy was injured after a part of the ceiling collapsed in Ajnara Homes society in Greater Noida West. Three people from the management and the builder’s group had also been arrested by the Bisrakh police in connection to the incident.In another incident on May 29, a woman had been injured when a ceiling’s part collapsed in a Prateek Wisteria in Sector 77. The builder’s group had, however, denied the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/75-year-old-woman-injured-as-part-of-ceiling-collapses-in-a-high-rise-in-greater-noida-west/story-1M3XgQTRiLIaqdmLozR5DJ.html
21-06-2020||Mumbai||Will act against societies if they refuse to let house help in: Maharashtra government||The state government is likely to crack the whip on housing societies restricting entry to maids despite the advisory issued on Thursday. Managing committee members of housing societies have been accused by state cooperation department officials of causing inconvenience to flat owners who wish to avail of domestic help services. Cooperative housing societies come under the jurisdiction of the state cooperation department. State cooperation minister Balasaheb Patil has called for action against office bearers of such housing societies. Earlier this week, Patil had appealed to housing societies to allow domestic help to resume work in a bid to avoid inconvenience to residents, especially senior citizens. However, managing committees of several housing societies in Mumbai are opposing the move. “The office bearers have become very arrogant and are not listening despite our advisory. We will issue a formal order this week. After that, if anyone complains, we will take action against such errant societies,” said Patil.Vishaka Sawant, a resident of a Parel housing society, said that the restriction is hampering her ability to go to work. “The society is not allowing me to bring my maid who has been taking care of my children for years. I am unable to proceed to my workplace in such circumstances. They don’t understand that Covid-19 is here to stay and I am ready to take all precautions with regards to my maid,” she said. A majority of housing societies imposed a ban on the entry of maids and drivers after the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 24. After the lockdown was eased from June 5, some of the societies started allowing maids on their premises. However, many societies have restricted their entry, citing that it poses a risk as the domestic help could be carriers of Covid-19. “A majority of maids stay in slums or chawls where social distancing is not possible. It is risky for us to allow them,” said Dhaval Shah, chairman, Lokhandwala-Oshiwara Residents Association. “A minority of flat-owners want to bring in maids. We cannot endanger the majority for these people,” he added. A domestic workers association has called this a case of discrimination against the poor and welcomed the government’s intervention. “The maids are as careful as anyone else with regards to the precautions against the virus. The societies are just robbing us of our livelihood. We demand that the individual owners decide on whether to hire the maid or not. This should not be on the whims and fancies of the society office bearers,” said Babli Rawat, president, Ghar Kamgar Molkarin Sanghatana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/will-act-against-societies-if-they-refuse-to-let-house-help-in-maharashtra-government/story-PVJH55yn93CeINlVVntGpN.html
21-06-2020||City||Patient’s consent must if covid treatment offered at regular rates: Govt order||New Delhi: Hospitals treating coronavirus disease (covid-19) patients at regular rates needs to seek written consent of the patient/attendent, says a Delhi government directive issued on Sunday.There are seven such hospitals in Delhi that are eligible to offer treatment at regulator rates over and above the subsidised treatment they must offer on 60% of their bed strength. “The authorities of the... 07 (seven) hospitals are directed to seek a written consent from a patient/ attendant prior to admitting him/her under 40% category at their schedule rates and the same shall be kept in record,” reads the directive.The hospitals are Max Saket, Ganga Ram Kolmet, Ganga Ram City Hospital, Maha Durga Charitable Trust, Cygnus Orthocare, Saroj Super specialty and Bansal Global Hospital.Those private hospitals that were allotted land at concessional rates by land owning agencies and are providing Covid related treatment, shall earmark 10% of the total Covid beds for free Covid related treatment of eligible patients of EWS category, says the government directive.Also, at least 100 hospitals in the city that have offered 20% of their beds for Covid treatment must provide treatment at concessional rates.The Delhi government said on Saturday that beds for Covid-19 patients at private hospitals will be subsidised, with treatment charges being reduced by 60-67%. The new rates, to be charged by all private hospitals with immediate effect, will be applicable to all Covid-19 beds at a private hospitals for up to 60% of its total capacity.100% Covid beds shall be subsidised up to an upper limit of 60% of total hospital capacity,” Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Saturday after the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, cleared the move.The rates now have been capped between Rs 8,000 (non-NABH accredited hospitals) and Rs 10,000 (NABH accredited hospitals including entry level facilities) a day for an isolation bed, Rs 13,000-15,000 a day for a bed at an intensive care unit (ICU), and Rs 15,000-18,000 a day for an ICU bed with ventilator. Until this order was issued on Saturday evening, the fee for an isolation bed in Delhi was Rs 24,000-25,000 a day. For an ICU bed, it was Rs 34,000-43,000 a day, while an ICU bed with ventilator was Rs 44,000-54,000 a day.The cap of up to 60% of the total beds in private hospitals means that hospitals such as Moolchand, Fortis, etc., which have been declared as 100% Covid-19 hospitals will also have to offer the new subsidised rates to 60% of the beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patient-s-consent-must-if-covid-treatment-offered-at-regular-rates-govt-order/story-BwSZyOAaLJ86o18Icl4UwJ.html
21-06-2020||City||Cheaper diesel in Noida attracts customers from Delhi, sale picked up, say petrol pumps||Noida: The soaring diesel prices in Delhi have come as a boon for fuel stations in Noida. With diesel prices in the district cheaper as compared to the neighbouring national capital, dispensing stations have been able to get customers from Delhi, recording at least 20% additional sales.While petrol is Rs 80.16 per litre in Noida, which is only Rs.0.93 dearer than Delhi (Rs 79.23), diesel prices in Noida as of Sunday was Rs.70.79, against Rs.78.27 in Delhi, leading to better sales in Noida and speedy recovery of losses faced due to the lockdown.“Yes, sales are better and we are seeing more vehicles of Delhi registration numbers, especially since Friday. It’s obvious that a price difference of Rs.5 to Rs.7 matters a lot to customers. We are seeing an additional demand of 8,000-10,000 litres of diesel per day that accounts for about 15-20% rise. Sales at filling stations bordering Delhi are recording an even higher increase, of around 40-50%,” said Deepak Chauhan, manager, Indian Oil petrol pump, Sector 41 Noida.Some petrol pump owners claim that the soaring prices in Delhi are helping them make up for the losses incurred due to the national wide lockdown in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.“We are still recovering from losses. Even though there are not that many vehicles on the road, motorists are slowly returning. We have experienced an increase in sales and many new customers are from Delhi, particularly since the last two-three days, this has helped us a little with recovery of losses,” said Kapil Singh, manager, Shaheed Chaman Petrol Pump, Sector 52, Noida.The Noida petrol pump association, however, observes that while the sale of diesel has risen due to the price difference in Delhi, the overall sales have been affected due to the continuous soaring prices of fuel.“The price of diesel and petrol has been good every day for the past 15 days, but that is only because the price of diesel is high in Delhi. The petrol price before the lockdown was around Rs.75 which is now Rs. 80; customers are affected because of this surge as well,” said Sushil Gupta, general secretary, petrol pump association, Gautam Budh Nagar.They differ in regions as respective state governments levy taxes at varying rates. With an additional value added tax (VAT) of 16% in Delhi, the price of both diesel and petrol are higher in the National Capital as compared to Uttar Pradesh. Fuel prices are decided by the central government. On Sunday, the price of diesel and petrol in Delhi were again hiked by 60 paise and 35 paisa, respectively, putting the cost of diesel at an all-time high.The fuel stations in Delhi, especially those at areas bordering Noida have been suffering heavy losses. “The sale is almost nil and it’s even difficult to manage salaries of staff. The main reason is because the Delhi government has hiked VAT. Against a daily diesel sale of 40,000-45,000 litres, we are currently selling only 1,000 to 1,500 litres per day, as customers have diverted to Noida or Haryana,” said Sunil Verma, owner of a petrol pump in Mayur Vihar Phase 3 in Delhi, merely a few hundred metres from the Noida border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cheaper-diesel-in-noida-attracts-customers-from-delhi-sale-picked-up-say-petrol-pumps/story-mB6NBtFZj8qrAKaP9QBZTP.html
21-06-2020||Bhopal||4 Covid-19 deaths in MP due to delayed referral, treatment: Health dept audit||An audit of Covid-19 deaths done by Madhya Pradesh’s health department has shown that four fatalities in the state were caused due to delayed referral or management in treatment.Following the audit, state’s principal secretary, health, Faiz Ahmad Kidwai, in a letter dated June 18, asked all the district collectors and chief medical and health officers (CMHOs) to take effective measures to check such lapses.The official gave details of all the four cases in his letter, the first of which was reported from Shajapur district.“The patient from Shajapur was 40-year-old. He was having fever and respiratory problems for 2- 3 days. He consulted the auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) who gave him some medicines and asked him to go home whereas the patient should have been immediately sent to the district hospital Covid centre for a medical examination. In the district hospital later, the medical specialist didn’t follow the protocols in letter and spirit. Hence, when the patient was referred to Indore two days later , his condition had worsened. The patient died”, the letter stated.The second death was of a 40-year-old from Bhopal who was examined in the outpatient department (OPD) of the district hospital and then sent back home with supportive and symptomatic treatment but without measuring his blood pressure and temperature. The patient returned to the same hospital five days later in a serious condition. He was referred to the medical college in Bhopal but declared brought dead. Later, the test of the sample suggested he was Covid-19 positive.“Had the Covid test and medical examination been done in the district hospital on time, proper treatment could have perhaps been ensured in this case”, the principal secretary said.In the other two cases, while one patient died in Indore due to lack of adequate surveillance at community level, the other patient passed away for want of proper monitoring at a quarantine centre, said Kidwai’s letter. Kidwai pointed out that the case studies suggest deaths due to Covid-19 can be minimised with proper testing and referrals.“These case studies suggest that if medical examination, test and referrals of the patients are done on time, the number of deaths caused due to complications arising from Covid-19 can be minimised”, said the principal secretary.A public health expert, too, reiterated the need for proper monitoring and referral.“We have been repeatedly pointing out from the day one as to where the problem lay. The health department has ultimately realised it now. There is no denying the fact that if survey, screening, medical examination, testing and treatment are done in an effective and professional manner, many such deaths could have been avoided and Madhya Pradesh would not have registered such a high death rate,” said public health expert Amulya Nidhi.However, Kidwai said that the situation in the state has vastly improved and the death rate has reduced.“These case studies have been suggested to all the districts to avoid recurrence of such delay in management and referrals. However, the situation in Madhya Pradesh has vastly improved which is reflected in the tremendous recovery rate of over 71% and considerably reduced death rate,” he said.As per the state health department’s bulletin released on Sunday night, Madhya Pradesh’s Covid-19 case count climbed to 11, 903 on Sunday , with 179 new infections reported in the last 24 hours. Of these, 9,015 have recovered from the disease and discharged from hospitals while 515 have died from the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/4-covid-19-deaths-in-mp-due-to-delayed-referral-treatment-state-audit/story-xuf0xsJtzl8d0HlQb20pXJ.html
21-06-2020||City||Noida: Layout of containment zone crucial to reduce Covid-19 spread, say officials||NOIDA: The Gautam Budh Nagar administration has decided to consider the layout of an area while finalising a containment zone as it will help in monitoring and implementation of the guidelines, officials said on Sunday. If the layout of containment zone is convenient, then it will help reduce the rising number of positive cases in the district, they said.“We have asked the incident commanders to keep in mind the layout while finalising the containment zones. It is crucial because it helps in implementation of the health guidelines in a containment zone,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, GB Nagar.There are five different zones -- Noida, Greater Noida, Dadri, Jewar and Sadar Tehsil -- in the GB Nagar district and each zone is taken care of by an incident commander. At Noida and Greater Noida’s urban areas, city magistrates are incident commanders, while in Jewar, Dadri and Sadar Tehsil areas, SDMs are incident commanders. The incident commanders have the onus of enforcing the rules in their respective areas and also supplying essential services to residents. The district has a total of 225 containment zones, as per the latest data from the administration. According to new rules of the Uttar Pradesh government, a containment zone can be is de-sealed 14 days after the last case in that particular area. Earlier, at least 236 containment zones were there in the district. The district administration’s move has come after several residents’ welfare associations, apartment owners’ associations and villagers demanded for more caution while declaring containment zones. There have been incidents when many far off areas were made part of a containment zone where implementing rules were not easy.“Sector 137 group housing societies were part of a containment zone that had Nagli Wazidpur village, which is 3km away and located on the other side of Noida expressway. Such containment zones don’t work out well because of distance,” said Prempal Chauhan, a resident of Nagli Wazidpur.Now, the administration will be making containment zone of one sector, without clubbing multiple sectors, one tower or two towers where multiple positive cases are or a village. Earlier, several sectors and housing societies were clubbed together to make a containment zone.“Earlier, supplying essential services was a huge task. But in small containment zones, now it is easier,” said an administration official, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-layout-of-containment-zone-crucial-to-reduce-covid-19-spread-say-officials/story-kqBCXVsY5bgpPTrE5WzFxO.html
21-06-2020||City||Revenue courts to start working from Monday||After remaining shut for almost three months, all revenue courts in Gautam Budh Nagar district will be operational and open to the general public from Monday (June 22). The opening of the revenue courts will help homebuyers get their due refund from property developers as ordered by the Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UP-Rera).The revenue courts were shut since March 24 the Uttar Pradesh government announced a lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The statewide lockdown merged with the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25.“We have asked all staff members to ensure that all revenue courts start operations from June 22. All senior officials are asked to inform their junior staff that they should report to work in the revenue courts as usual from June 22,” Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.When a homebuyer files a refund case against a builder with the UP-Rera and regulatory body decides in favour of the buyer ordering the administration to recover the revenue, it is the revenue court staff that carries out the job. At least 1,000 recovery orders of the authority related to homebuyers and developers are yet to be implemented because of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, a UP-Rera official, who did not wish to be named, said.Lawyers said that opening up of revenue courts will help the public get their work stuck because of the lockdown done now. “Since the lockdown started, work related to recovering revenue was stuck and of the government and homebuyers, investors and even the government suffered. While the civil courts were already working, people can start getting their work done from Monday at the revenue court as well. However, maintaining social distance must be the top priority for everyone to stay safe during the Covid-19 pandemic,” Parminder Singh Bhati, advocate and former president, Gautam Budh Nagar bar association, said.The UP government had on June 19 sent a letter to the DM on opening the revenue courts. Subsequently, the Gautam Budh Nagar DM has issued an official order on June 20 in this regard asking the naib tehsildar, tehsildar, and other officials to take necessary action so that the state government’s directions are implemented.Naib tehsildar, a key official in the revenue administration, decides cases related to land disputes, recovery of revenue from land-owning farmers, and also cases related to the recovery of revenue from commercial and institutional groups and property developers for the government..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/revenue-courts-to-start-working-from-monday/story-TRI2EdZwOYeht4xNw7XgvJ.html

This costs a big packet. We decided to celebrate differently,” said Lobo.Only 22 guests attended the wedding and all wore face masks and maintained social distancing. “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, scores of people are dying and in Vasai-Virar. In the Palghar district, around 90 people have died and more than 1,500 have tested positive, so we decided to contribute our bit,” said Lobo. “We wanted to share our joy with our fellow Vasai residents by helping provide better care for patients in hospitals,” he added.In March, Lobo and Merlin approached local MLA Kshitij Thakur with the idea and he directed them to Dr Kailas Shinde, Palghar district collector, who approved the special project. “We then approached a Vasai fabricator to design the hospital beds as per government health department specifications and also contacted various linen dealers to give us a good deal for mattresses, blankets, pillows, bedsheets, and other allied materials,” said Lobo, adding, “We also decided to provide oxygen cylinders as and when health department officials need them to treat Covid patients.”After the marriage ceremony, which was attended by Thakur, the couple went to the Covid care centre where the beds had already arrived. A small inauguration was held with the couple still in their wedding clothes.Earlier, the couple was actively involved in the local community kitchen and also helped provide the government with lists of migrants from Vasai-Virar who wanted passage on Shramik special trains to return to their home towns.“Eric and Merlin have set an example for the society and I congratulate them for their noble deed,” said Thakur. “Good Samaritans like these will help us battle the Covid pandemic and come out of it quickly. Residents of Vasai-Virar have always been supportive of their society, and I am optimistic that more people will come forward to do their bit in the coming days,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/couple-donates-50-beds-oxygen-cylinders-on-wedding-day/story-5Y2ObbZ7cICS9dIt3MIASO.html

21-06-2020||City||GB Nagar has lowest fatality rate among UP’s 10 districts worst affected by Covid-19||NOIDA: Despite having the highest number of coronavirus (Covid-19) cases across Uttar Pradesh, the Noida district has the lowest fatality rate of 1.31% among the 10 worst-affected districts in the state.According to the Covid-19 data released by state health department on June 20, out of overall 17,135 positive cases reported so far in UP, Noida district tops the list with a tally of 1,369, which is 7.98% of the total positive cases in the state, followed by Agra, Kanpur and Ghaziabad.Meanwhile, neighbouring Ghaziabad has a recovery rate of 51.71% (423 cured of 818), the corresponding figure for Noida district is 48.28% (661 cured of 1,369 patients). When asked, Noida district magistrate Suhas LY said the highest number of Covid-19 cases detected in the district indicates that tracking and testing are being done properly and systematically. “And, the low fatality rate denotes that our team of doctors at different Covid-dedicated hospitals in the district are providing proper treatment to the infected patients,” he said.Echoing similar views, chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said the lowest fatality rate among the worst-affected districts is a very positive indication. “Our doctors have handled the cases adroitly. On average, most of the patients turn negative and asymptomatic in less than a week,” he said.The death rate is lowest in Noida among all UP district because of multiple reasons, including better monitoring of Covid as well and non-Covid patients, early detection of patients and aggressive surveillance, said senior IAS officer and nodal officer for Covid-19 in the district, Narendra Bhooshan. “We are also in touch with private hospitals to provide better medical facilities to the needy. And our doctors at government hospitals are motivated and are doing an excellent job,” Bhooshan said.According to Dr Rakesh Gupta, the director of Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, fatality rate is low in the district because of multi-level monitoring of infected patients. “Our doctors have adopted many innovative methods to ensure full-proof recovery of Covid-19 patients. After testing positive, we conduct multiple tests to detect their other ailments. It gives us better vision to diagnose and medicate them. It is not about just finding positives and starting generic treatment for them. But, more important is to find out what other ailments could affect the recovery span of the patients,” he said. As per the data, after GB Nagar, state capital Lucknow has the minimum death rate of 1.51%, followed by Kanpur city (3.66%). In GB Nagar district, 18 persons have died of coronavirus disease till June 20. While Jhansi has the highest fatality rate of 11.42% (11 died of 98 cases), Meerut and Agra have 9.54% (75 died of 786) and 6.95% (79 died of 1,136), respectively. Among other worst affected districts, Aligarh has a fatality rate of 5.63% (20 died of 355) and Ghaziabad has 5.01% (41 died of 818).In terms of recovery rate among the districts having 750-plus cases so far, Agra has maximum recovery rate of 79.92% (908 Covid-19 patients cured of 1,136 total cases), followed by Meerut (59.66%), Lucknow (56.89%) and Kanpur city (54.52%).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gb-nagar-has-lowest-fatality-rate-among-up-s-10-districts-worst-affected-by-covid-19/story-iRX5YykAHdNmtzHSEunq8L.html
21-06-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Parents’ body writes to DM to not reopen schools till September 30||Ghaziabad: The members of Ghaziabad Parents’ Association (GPA) have written to the district magistrate to defer reopening of schools till September 30 due to high incidence of Covid-19 cases in the district. In an online survey conducted by the association, 97% of the parents who participated said that they are not in favour of reopening the schools in July. The survey had 2,106 responses about the issue, the association said.Ghaziabad has witnessed a sudden spurt in Covid-19 cases this month. In a period of 20 days since June 1, the district has added to its tally 548 positive cases and 38 deaths. Overall, the total positive cases stood at 853 till June 20, which included 42 deaths.“The parents are alarmed by the situation. So, we have written to the district magistrate not to reopen schools till September 30. The Covid-19 cases are on the rise and it will be difficult to manage situation in schools with thousands of children studying together. The online survey had a question whether the schools should reopen in July or not. About 97% of the respondents opposed the idea,” said Seema Tyagi, president of GPA.Tyagi said that it will not be practically possible for schools to ensure that children maintain social distancing, and don’t share food, among other things. “Above all, we don’t have a vaccine yet to deal with Covid-19. In case children get infected, it will be very difficult to keep them in isolation. The monsoon season is approaching and it brings in a number of viral diseases,” she added.In its Unlock 1.0 guidelines issued on May 30, the Union ministry of home affairs had stated that schools, colleges, educational institutions, etc will be reopened after consultations with states and Union Territories in July. State governments and UT administrations may hold consultations at the institution level with parents and other stakeholders, the ministry had said in a statement. When asked, Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said he has been receiving representations from parents for not allowing opening of schools. “We will soon hold a review meeting and write to the state government about the issues concerning parents. It will be an overall decision which will be taken up by the state government,” Pandey added.Further, the reopening of colleges will also be a tricky situation for Ghaziabad authorities as about 13 different colleges in the district have been proposed to have Covid care facilities as part of state government’s plan to deal with rising number of cases. In Ghaziabad, the health department has proposed 4,000 Covid beds at 13 colleges.In a related case, the Lucknow Bench of Allahabad High Court on June 15 ordered the state government to take a decision in larger public interest. The court’s decision arrived on a petition seeking closure of schools up to class 12 till a single patient of Covid-19 remains or its vaccine comes in the market.The directions were issued by the Bench of justices Devendra Kumar Updhyay and Narendra Kumar on a writ petition filed by Anuj Nishad, a student. “With regard to the prayer made in this writ petition, this court is clearly of the opinion that the issue raised herein should be considered by the government itself. Accordingly, we direct the state government to consider the grievance raised in this writ petition and take a decision thereon,” the court had said in its order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-parents-body-writes-to-dm-to-not-reopen-schools-till-september-30/story-YAx1iEB68bH2NpaMOWRtbO.html

21-06-2020||City||Court fines applicants who opposed use of homoeopathic drug against Covid-19||PUNE A city court has levied a fine of Rs 10,000 against two applicants, including a doctor, for filing case against civic officials for violating human rights by distributing and promoting the use of arsenicum album 30, a homoeopathic drug prescribed for the treatment Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection.The two applicants Adam Beig (57) member of Care of Public Safety, public trust and his co-applicant Dr Abhishek Haridas (37), residents of Kothrud, had filed a case against Pune district collector and Pune municipal commissioner for violating human rights of residents.The order by principal district and sessions judge SR Navandar, dismissing the application, read, “The application is hereby dismissed with costs of Rs 10,000 to be paid to District Legal Services Authority (DLSA), Pune. If the applicants fail to pay the costs, jointly or severally, the same be recovered from them as land revenue.”The applicant has claimed to not have received a copy of the order.Haridas, “There were applications in the Kerela and Madras High Courts about use of homoeopathic medicine. The orders show that the courts have asked only for modern medicine to be used.”“Here politicians and PMC officials are distributing the drug without any medical inspection. The drugs have been distributed to Covid-19 patients and healthy people as well. My application was neither civil nor criminal, it was about human rights violation,” he said.The order further read: “From the conduct and approach of the applicants, what appears is that by taking undue advantage of the existing situation of pandemic they made an attempt to get cheap publicity.”“Thereby they have taken a lot of time of the court, particularly when the court is busy in dealing with important urgent bail applications of jail inmates and injunction matters. Such conduct on the part of the mischievous applicants needs to be curbed by imposing exemplary costs,” reads one of the concluding portions of the court order.In a Press Information Bureau (PIB) press release issued by Ayush Ministry on January 29, the drug is recommended for use in consultation with registered Ayurvedic practitioners.“The Group of Expertsinter-alia has recommended that homoeopathy medicine arsenicum album 30 could be taken as prophylactic medicine against Covid-19 infections, which has also been advised for prevention of ILI (influenza-like illness),” it reads.However, the court order by Judge Navandar reads, “In the documents submitted on behalf of the applicants, said medicine is referred to as an immunity riser and not as a vaccine or antidote for Covid-19 virus.”The said medicine has been distributed among officials of various government offices in the city to boost their immunity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/court-fines-applicants-who-opposed-use-of-homoeopathic-drug-against-covid-19/story-n7zUpc7VYNPzqbdJYIeOnL.html

21-06-2020||Chandigarh||GMCH-32 staff crunch hits ₹5lakh PM-JAY health cover scheme||Chandigarh: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pet scheme offering ₹5lakh health cover to families from economically weaker sections has been hit as the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, does not have enough staff to register patients during night hours. All energies are directed at combating Covid-19, hospital authorities say. Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojna (PM-JAY) under Ayushman Bharat offers secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation to over 10.74 crore poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries) that form the bottom 40% of the Indian population.However, GMCH-32, the only tertiary care hospital under the UT administration, has two employees to register the patients, a process which hospital staff say requires at least eight employees completing three shifts in 24 hours.Though the matter has been brought to the UT administration’s notice through an online complaint filed by 22-year-old social activist Vaibhav Gupta, no measures have been taken to rectify the problem.“Patients with Ayushman Bharat Scheme Card can avail of services from 9pm to 5pm, but not at night when the counters close, which can be very inconvenient for patients, especially during emergencies,” Vaibhav said .Admitting that the staff crunch was making things difficult, hospital medical superintendent Dr Ravi Gupta said, “We are sorting it out and have also asked for staff from director health services, who is also the CEO of Ayushman here. But as all our energies are diverted towards dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic many services are unavailable.”However, he was optimistic that authorities would soon find a way out of the problem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gmch-32-staff-crunch-hits-5lakh-pm-jay-health-cover-scheme/story-HlbRwht9VammQxf4pc5a9M.html

21-06-2020||Chandigarh||Stigma, social boycott awaits residents of former containment zones in Chandigarh||After facing hardships living in one, the residents of erstwhile containment zones are now struggling with social stigma and ostracisation, which is costing them their jobs, marriage proposals and social relationships.For containing the spread of coronavirus in the city, the UT administration had declared six areas as containment zones. Strict perimeter control was enforced in these areas with high incidence of positive cases.With no new case being reported in five of the six zones for 28 days, the administration ended the containment operations in Sector 30, Sector 52, Shastri Nagar (Manimajra), Kachhi Colony in Dhanas, Sector 38 and some parts of Bapu Dham Colony.Residents were desperately hoping that the removal of the containment tag will mean life back to normal. But for most of them, it has only worsened. A hard reality hit residents when they realised they were no longer welcome in social gatherings and even in their workplaces.MARRIAGES BROKEN OFF, FIRED FROM WORKLiving in Bapu Dham Colony not only cost Baljeet Singh his daughter’s marriage, but also his job. Baljeet, formerly a driver with a private company, said, “In April last year, we accepted a marriage proposal for my daughter from a family living in Dhanas. The marriage was to take place in June this year. But when parts of Bapu Dham were declared containment zones, even though my house didn’t fall in it, the Dhanas family broke all contacts with us. We were told by one of their relatives that they didn’t want to marry in a family living in Bapu Dham Colony.” The company where he was working as a driver also fired him because of that tag.An evaluation engineer, Gurpreet Singh, a resident of Sector 30, also lost his job even though his employer maintained it was a performance-based decision. “After containment restrictions ended, I went back to my job. But the management laid me off, saying my performance was not satisfactory. In three years of working there, I was never told my work was not good.”COME BACK IN A MONTH: EMPLOYERSMeanwhile, some residents are not being fired at work, but being asked to come back after a month or more. “I work as a salesman in a mobile shop at Elante Mall. I thought with the mall opening I will get back to work. When I asked my employer, he refused. He asked me to call him after a month,” said another resident of Bapu Dham, requesting anonymity.Yanki Kaliya, a local Congress leader in Bapu Dham Colony, said, “Most Bapu Dham residents either work in Industrial Area factories or in shops in sectors like 22 and 17. Their employers have not been keen to take them back at all.”Some residents have said they have been ostracised on the social front as well. Rajinder Kaur Panag, a resident of Sector 30, said, “Children from the area are not welcome to play with children living in other sectors. Some tuition teachers are also asking them not to come. People have even stopped calling us to social functions like marriages or birthday parties.”When contacted, UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said, “If we get a specific complaint, we will advise the employer [to not lay off people].” The administration has made the SDM of the area the nodal officer for addressing complaints regarding job loss. As per the administration officials, they have intervened successfully in 800 such matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/stigma-social-boycott-awaits-residents-of-former-containment-zones-in-chandigarh/story-OXL9lteg6t9WMAs3eZwaHI.html
21-06-2020||Chandigarh||As restrictions ease in Chandigarh, tracing contacts of Covid-19 cases becoming wild-goose chase||With the lockdown restrictions removed and Covid-19 cases rising consistently, tracing community contacts of positive patients has become a Herculean task for the municipal corporation teams tasked with the job. As the city gradually returns to normalcy, people are coming in contact with a number of strangers in the community, leaving no foolproof system of tracing all persons who positive patients may have come in contact with.UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta says the person testing positive shares the name and other information of the people who they have met recently.“These people are traced and home quarantined. Besides, a poster to this effect is pasted outside their houses. In a few cases, we also track their movement with the help of their mobile phones,” he adds.But, this methodology helps only so much with people venturing out in public places without any restrictions. For instance, a medical shop owner and its workers had tested positive for the virus earlier in June. The infection even spread to the workers’ family members in different parts of the tricity. However, the contact tracing teams soon found out that it was next to impossible to trace all customers, who these workers may have served at the shop.Similarly, an auto driver was found infected after he transported a Covid-19 positive patient to the hospital. Even though the auto driver’s family members tested negative, there is no clarity on the number of passengers he ferried in his vehicle after contracting the infection. In another such case, a Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) constable, who is posted at the Punjab Civil Secretariat, took leave after testing positive for the virus. A resident of Daria village, he never developed any symptoms and continued to check visitors at the secretariat before isolating himself.Simultaneously, a number of cases have cropped up where the health teams have no information with regard to the source of infection. Such cases have been reported from Sectors 24, 25, 43 and 47.Anil Kumar Garg, MC additional commissioner-cum-nodal officer, MC contact tracing teams, say their focus is on quarantining the immediate contacts within six hours to contacin the spread of infection.“People’s movement has returned to normal since the lockdown restrictions were removed. So, finding the source of infection and all community contacts is pretty difficult. However, our four teams are working hard it,” Garg says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/as-restrictions-ease-in-chandigarh-tracing-contacts-of-covid-19-cases-becoming-wild-goose-chase/story-8eV4KbbS4uovlSr7596UEP.html
21-06-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 patients from outside Panchkula keep authorities on toes, furnish wrong addresses||The lengths to which people will go to for their own convenience to create problems for health authorities became evident recently when some people coming into Panchkula for Covid-19 tests deliberately furnished wrong addresses.The reason probably is avoiding detection to skip mandatory quarantining.Eleven persons tested positive in Panchkula on Sunday, of whom only seven were from the district. A 60-year-old couple had given a Sector 5 address but was later found to be living in Baltana when traced through mobile phone numbers. Similarly, three others, whose positive test reports came in on Saturday, included two from Lucknow and one from Delhi. They had given local addresses of their relatives but were later found to be living elsewhere. Seven members of a Delhi family who tested positive recently had come to Panchkula only to get tests done this week and were putting up at a Zirakpur hotel. The businessman had provided the address of a factory in Panchkula’s industrial area, which he had reportedly rented out and had later shut down. He is at present staying with his family in Delhi.Another family, including a couple and two children from Delhi, who tested positive, were found to be residents of Delhi. They had given the address of relatives in Sector 27 to health authorities. A man visiting the town from Gujarat also tested positive. “We found the addresses were wrong only after the positive test reports came in,” added a senior health official.“People from outstation are coming to Panchkula to get their tests done. They are providing wrong addresses. Verification is taking a lot of manpower and time,” said Jasjeet Kaur, civil surgeon Panchkula.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-patients-from-outside-panchkula-keep-authorities-on-toes-furnish-wrong-addresses/story-rFwUqLLIoyLSDkskENeyZI.html
21-06-2020||City||‘Dead’ shown as beneficiaries of ration meant for poor in Ludhiana, says BJP||A “dead” man walked away with a ration kit meant for the poor, the local unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claimed here on Sunday.Accusing the Congress government of committing a major bungling in the distribution of centrally sponsored ration, state BJP chief spokesperson Anil Sareen said several metric tonnes of ration, meant to be distributed among the poor during the lockdown, have been siphoned off by showing the dead as beneficiaries.The party has demanded a CBI probe or investigation by a sitting judge of the high court in the matter.Showing the identity card of a dead person, on whose name ration was distributed in the central constituency of the city, Sareen said persons such as Kanta Rani and Gagandeep Singh, who had died in 2019; Ashok Kumar Sharma of Kashmir Nagar, who had passed away in 2015 and his relative Neeraj (also shown as Ashok Kumar) who had died in 2013, were shown as beneficiates of the ration scheme.“A Nisha Rani of the same area is not aware that there was a ration card in her name and five persons have been shown as beneficiaries. Nisha is not a stray case. There are many such fake beneficiaries. Besides, details of Aadhaar and ration cards did not match with those of the beneficiaries,” said Sareen.District BJP president Pushpinder Singhal said a ration kit consisting of 15kg wheat flour and 3kg pulses, meant for three-month consumption, was to be distributed among the poor.“The ration scam is far bigger than the seed or liquor scams unearthed recently. The Congress regime has usurped ration worth several hundreds of crores allotted from the central pool,” said Singhal.He added, “A total of 2.12 lakh metric tonne grain, 10,605 metric tonne pulses had arrived, but either the dead or the fake beneficiaries walked away with it while the poor, such as Ajit Kumar Rai, were forced to commit suicide due to non-availability of ration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dead-shown-as-beneficiaries-of-ration-meant-for-poor-in-ludhiana-says-bjp/story-q1Xta4UfIYunueYliP0q3K.html

Hence, most of small sewing machines, parts and assembling units are closed.The cycle parts and manufacturing industry is planning to engage local labour.DS Chawla, president of the United Cycles and Parts Manufacturers Association (UPCMA), said, “Most of the units are small and micro and they cannot afford airfare for labourers. So, we are planning to engage local labour through the employment exchange.”RK Yadav, general secretary of the Punjab unit of the Samajwadi Party and a labour leader, said labourers want to come back to the city, but they are not getting reservation in trains.

It was 5km-by-5km and very dense. Earlier, on Saturday, four swarms entered Jaipur from Nagaur and after control operation in the evening, were reported to have moved towards Tonk on Sunday.Meanwhile, the Rajasthan Agricultural Competitiveness Project (RACP), a World Bank-funded project, has issued work order for 211 tractor-mounted power sprayer for locust management in Bikaner and Jalore districts, and 200 for Barmer and Jaisalmer. The budget for these sprayers is Rs 1.56 crore.Work orders were also issued for supply of two pesticides – Lambda Cyhalothrin 5% EC and Deltamethrin 2.8% EC – in 13 districts.The state government had earlier sanctioned Rs 1.47 crore from the state disaster relief fund (SDRF) for hiring vehicles, tractor-mounted sprayers and pesticides.RACP project director Alok Ranjan said pesticides worth Rs 1.39 crore have been ordered from a Jaipur supplier. “The two pesticides will be supplied in packing of one litre and will be sent directly to the deputy directors of the agriculture department in the respective districts before June 30,” he said.The pesticides will be supplied to Barmer, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Nagaur, Jalore, Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh, Pali, Churu, Ajmer, Jaipur and Sirohi. The biggest supply will be made to Barmer – 3,000 litres each of Lambda and Deltamethrin. Sirohi gets the smallest supply – 1,000 litres of Lambda and 500 litres of Deltamethrin.Ranjan said under the integrated locust (pest) control plan of RACP, small and marginal farmers will also be provided the pesticides for use in a maximum area of two hectares. “They will be made aware about their safety and the precautions to take while using the pesticides,” he added.Locust outbreak was reported in Rajasthan in May 2019 after a gap of 26 years. The attack continued until February this year and the pests devoured crops on at least 670,000 hectares across 12 districts, causing a loss of around Rs 1,000 crore, according to the state agriculture department.The second wave of locust invasion began on April 11 this year when locust swarms entered Rajasthan from Hindumalkot in Sriganganagar and Babla in Jaisalmer.Joint director of plant protection division in state agriculture department, Dr Suwa Lal Jat said until Sunday, more than 200,000 hectares in 29 districts had been affected by the crop-munching pests. Control operations have been done in around 180,000 hectares.Meanwhile, according to a bulletin by the locust warning organization (LWO), breeding of locusts has been reported in Bikaner district amid frequent outbreaks in the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.

Nanda alleged that despite the land being registered jointly under his and Mann’s name, the latter fraudulently sold it to a builder without his authorisation.The complainant said by selling off a portion of the land, which was valued at over Rs 1 lakh per square yard, the entire property was rendered useless for any project, as there is no other direct passage to it.On Nanda’s complaint, Mann has been booked under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 82 (falsely personates another, and in such assumed character presents any document) of the Registration Act, 1908.On his part, Mann issued a press release, stating that Nanda had filed the same complaint against him to director, Bureau of Investigation (BOI), Punjab Police Headquarters, Sector 9, Chandigarh, on July 28 last year. He claimed that after recording Nanda’s complaint and completing the investigation, BOI had found nothing incriminating against him and had closed the case in March this year. Zirakpur station house officer (SHO) Gurwant Singh said they had booked Mann for cheating, and he will be asked to join the investigations, he added.Last year in April, Mann and his associate, Sajjan Kumar, were booked on charges of cheating and criminal conspiracy on another complaint by Nanda, who had alleged that his firm had sustained monetary losses due to fraud by the duo. State awardee for social serviceA social activist since 1988, Mann has been working for visually impaired children, orphans and accident victims, while also performing the last rites of unclaimed bodies. He also runs a 24-hour helpline for victims of real estate cases.He was awarded the Punjab Government State award and Parman Patra by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh at the Independence Day function in 2004.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/social-activist-booked-for-fraudulently-selling-prime-land-in-zirakpur/story-i1xTBPtpekYYgm4NjV0avI.html
21-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh mulling 5,000 more seats to help kids shift from private to govt schools||The UT education department is planning to create 5,000 additional seats for students willing to move from private to government schools in this academic year, said Rubinderjit Singh Brar, director, school education, on Sunday. The move comes in the wake of hordes of requests by parents of children studying in private schools, seeking school change amid the economic slowdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic.There are 114 government schools in Chandigarh, of which 40 are at the senior-secondary level. Around 1.4 lakh students are enrolled in these schools, education department figures reveal.Sources in the department said several parents had approached the education department seeking clarity on the admission process if they shifted their wards from private schools, as it had become difficult for them to pay the hefty fees.“My wife lost her job due to the lockdown. How will we manage our household expenses if we pay Rs 4,000 per month as tuition fee to my son’s school?” asked Sulabh Kumar, whose son is a student at a Sector-38 school.For over a month, parents across Chandigarh have been protesting outside various schools demanding fee waiver. While the UT administration had earlier directed schools to defer fee collection, it had later permitted collection of only tuition fees. This was followed by a flurry of complaints to UT’s fee regulatory authority, alleging overcharging by schools during the lockdown.DSE Brar said, “We are working out the details of a special admission campaign. We may set up an online centralised platform for a few schools with low enrolment. Parents will be able to shortlist three schools.”Brar said many parents had raised queries about fees, admissions in Class 9 and neighbourhood policy under the Right to Education Act. “We wish to enrol around 5,000 fresh students this academic year,” he said, adding that the initiative was awaiting the nod of senior officials of the department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mulling-5-000-more-seats-to-help-kids-shift-from-private-to-govt-schools/story-MYk9DdCVO0ukTWtsyHBPdJ.html
21-06-2020||Chandigarh||Monsoon to arrive in Chandigarh on June 25: IMD||Chandigarh witnessed its first premonsoon showers of the season, with 32.9mm rain recorded in the early hours of Sunday, while monsoon is likely to arrive around June 25, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).“Due to prevailing pressure conditions in the country, the monsoon system has accelerated, and premonsoon winds have already reached the city,” said IMD’s regional director Surender Paul. “Monsoon is likely to enter the city around June 25, five days earlier than the normal date of June 30.” It was last in 2015 that monsoon had arrived this early in Chandigarh. In 2019, the onset was witnessed on July 5.Paul said monsoon is declared when continuous rain is received over 50% of the region for two days. Usually premonsoon starts three days before the onset of monsoon, he said.“Early onset of monsoon is a good sign for the region, as higher rains can be expected during the season. When monsoon starts late, the overall rainfall is mostly below normal. The La Nina current is also expected to boost monsoon rains during the later part of the season,” he said.As per the long-range forecast released by the IMD this month, the region is expected to receive around 107% of the normal rain during the monsoon months (from June to September). The normal rain for Chandigarh during this period is 845.7mm.June already wettest since 2013After the Sunday showers, Chandigarh has recorded 135mm rain till June 21, already the highest for this month since 2013, when 275.1mm rain was recorded, according to the IMD data. “This month due to a number of western disturbances and their interaction with low-level moisture-laden northeasterly winds, there was higher than normal rainfall in the city. More rain is expected with monsoons set to start around June 25,” he said.However, even as premonsoon showers were witnessed on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday are expected to stay on the drier side, according to IMD officials. “Only light rain up to 20mm is expected on Monday and Tuesday. However, moderate rain up to 40mm can be expected from Wednesday onwards,” said the weatherman.Maximum temperature can also go up on Monday, but cloudy weather is likely to drop the mercury again from Tuesday.Maximum temperature fell from 36.8°C on Saturday to 33.7°C on Sunday, four degrees below normal owing to rain in the early hours and solar eclipse in the afternoon. Minimum temperature went down from 29.1°C to 22.8°C, two degrees below normal. In the next three days, maximum temperature will remain between 34 and 36 degrees while minimum temperature will remain between 23 and 25 degrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/monsoon-to-arrive-in-chandigarh-on-june-25-imd/story-5qo3cpqZyNsbCTCalE7GFP.html

Such negligence and pathetic approach negates the good work being done by frontline workers in fighting the pandemic and therefore it is imperative to identify the wrong-doers so that they are dealt in per law, he said, adding that the incident has shaken the conscience of the people, who received this chilling news with shock and disbelief.Rana expressed solidarity with the families who lost their kin, saying no words were enough to console their great loss.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rana-seeks-nhrc-probe-into-tragic-death-of-two-kin-of-covid-19-victim-in-jammu/story-j1pS4RwXNexwvTIz2vhafK.html

But he has not been available,” says sub-inspector Janardan Ram of Barsoi police station in Bihar. The case was registered on April 16, 2019, after the cricketer-turned-politician appealed to Muslims to “unite and vote” against PM Narendra Modi.

As per the deal, the accused demanded ₹5 lakh per person, Manjit said.“I then handed over ₹8.5 lakh in cash to the accused and also transferred ₹4 lakh in his bank account on different dates. The rest of the money was to be given after my relatives got the jobs,” said Manjit.“To win our trust, the accused handed over 8 cheques as guarantee. However, later, Swarn stopped picking up my phone calls. After futile attempts to meet him, I realised that we had been duped. I then lodged a complaint with the police,” he added.ASI Sandeep Singh of Ladhowal police station said a case under sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC has been registered against the accused.

21-06-2020||Lucknow||SP in reactivation mode with VCs, rebuilding & protests||The Samajwadi Party (SP) is slowly gearing up its political activities and simultaneously preparing for the UP assembly elections due in 2022. After a hiatus of two months due to the lockdown, party president Akhilesh Yadav has restarted establishing contact with the party’s outfits in the districts and reorganising the district units. The party has also started taking to the streets in the form of protests.On June 2, Akhilesh began doing video conferencing with party leaders, on June 10 the party did organisational restructuring for the assembly polls and appointed new district presidents in nine districts. On June 11, the party expelled two members from its frontal organisations and last week it again declared over half-a-dozen party leaders as spokespersons. The SP had disbanded its team of media spokesperson the day after 2019 Lok Sabha polls results were declared.“Yes, our party has resumed political activities, although it was active since Lockdown-1 with all district units helping people with food and ration. Now, the party president has begun direct contact and discussions with party units across the state through video and WhatsApp calling,” said former SP minister and party’s state spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary.Akhilesh started reviews and feedback gathering from districts on June 3 and since then had discussions with leaders and office-bearers in Ayodhya, Bijnore, Mahoba, Kannauj, Gonda, Kanpur, Chandauli, Azamgarh, Sidharthnagar, Farrukhabad, Sant Kabir Nagar, Agra, Ghazipur, Barabanki, and Varanasi. The interactions revolved around intensifying poll preparations for the assembly elections, consolidating respective district units right up to booth level and reorganisation of booth committees, Chaudhary said. Akhilesh is now asking the party outfit to “expose the BJP’s lies” by beginning to tell people that first it was BJP government’s demonetization; then GST crippled the nation and whatever little was left of the economy was crushed by the unplanned and dictatorial lockdowns, he said.The party has also resumed protests. On June 8, the Ghaziabad district president Haji Rashid Malik, and his team protested on their bicycles at the gate of the closed factory of a prominent bicycle brand in Ghaziabad. The protestors then sent a memorandum to the UP governor seeking reopening of the factory. And for last six days, a former SP MLA in Kanpur is sitting on a dharna there over drinking water problem. “In future our protests would increase . Except for Team-11 meetings every day, the government is doing nothing for the people. . We are waiting for the next assembly session, where we will effectively corner the government,” Chaudhary said. Pawan Pandey, former Ayodhya MLA with whom Akhilesh spoke on Tuesday through video call, said: “I told him that we are always among people, as he had asked, since Lockdown-1. It is people like us that are helping the needy and migrants; the government is only playing number games by quoting statistics. .”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/sp-in-reactivation-mode-with-vcs-rebuilding-protests/story-IiIQxDWyjlslU7fTIqLylL.html
21-06-2020||Chandigarh||Bajwa raises questions over civil service board for IAS transfers||Congress MP Partap Singh Bajwa on Sunday raised questions over the Amarinder Singh government’s decision to set up a three-member civil services board (CSB) for transfers and postings of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers in the state.In a letter to the chief minister, Bajwa said the setting up of the board under the chief secretary (CS) had ruffled the feelings of many Congress MPs and MLAs in the state. “The timing of your move is ominous. Just when cabinet ministers have been humiliated by the chief secretary, you have set up an all-powerful CSB to ensure that bureaucracy becomes much less answerable and accountable...this has sent a disturbing and negative signal to already demoralised elected representatives,” he wrote in a two-page letter.The Punjab government issued the notification for the three-member CSB on June 2. HT was the first to report on the constitution of the board and the detailed procedure laid down by the state government for postings and transfers of IAS officers before completion of two-year tenure. The notification is based on an order issued by the Union ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions on January 28, 2014, when the Manmohan Singh-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was in power. It was aimed at providing stability of tenure and checking political interference. In October 2013, the Supreme Court had mandated minimum tenure for bureaucrats. Punjab is the 20th state to adopt these rules.Bajwa, in his letter, said many states, including Punjab, had not set up CSB and successive governments had decided not to set it up for many years till now, but the state bureaucracy had now staged a coup through the June 2 order to render the ministers and MLAs helpless in raking up neglected issues of public importance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bajwa-raises-questions-over-civil-service-board-for-ias-transfers/story-NCx2hgHhzpPkXgF0LWnisL.html
21-06-2020||Lucknow||Lapses surface as MNREGS expands, govt acts tough||On June 15, the day Uttar Pradesh attained the Number One position in the country in engaging the highest number of workers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) in a day, action was also taken against six people in a village in eastern UP for irregularities in the execution of a project under the scheme. The accused had engaged a heavy earth-mover for digging a pond instead of deploying MNREGS enrollees.With more focus on MNREGS post the pandemic, the state is reporting irregularities and corruption in the scheme’s execution from different parts and the government is taking firm action.So when the government received a complaint from the Itaur (Shuklapurwa) gram panchayat of Mankapur development block in Gonda district, it investigated the case, found the allegations true and acted. It suspended two government officials -- village development officer and secretary for their involvement and filed an FIR against four people -- village head, gram rozgar sewak (employment assistant), secretary and owner of the heavy earth-mover for execution of the irregularity.The sanctioned fund for the pond-digging was Rs 2.608 lakh. The government also issued a recovery notice against the village head, rozgar sewak and the secretary.“This year, the state government created 7.93 crore man-days under the MNREGS till Monday and 57.13 lakh in a single day on that day. With over 27 lakh migrants and workers returning from other states, the chief minister zeroed-in on MNREGS as the first and instant line of employment generation in villages. He has directed strict action against those who either do not create MNREGS jobs or allow any anomaly,” said a state government spokesperson.So, the UP rural development department acted tough in a far more glaring case of anomalies in Ratanpura development block of Mau district. “No MNREGS work was done in 15 gram panchayats while the orders are that each gram panchayat must execute more than one project so that in these critical times labourers may get help. Still no effort was made to give jobs. Not only this, even last year’s payments totalling Rs 8.34 lakh were pending. The government had sanctioned Rs 29.59 lakh for Chakra, Rs 26.81 lakh for Piparsath, Rs 15.16 lakh for Sidhwal, Rs 19.98 lakh for Gadhwa and Rs 21.11 lakh for Devdah under the material component of the MNREGS, but no work was found done on the sites. All this was tantamount to serious negligence in duties,” said Manoj Kumar Singh, principal secretary, rural development department, in a suspension order dated June 9 for Ramesh Yadav, block development officer, Ratanpura.Singh also recommended adverse entry in service records of the CDO, Mau and terminated services of over half-a-dozen additional programme officers, technical assistants, and rozgar sewaks. “The chief minister’s zero-tolerance policy against corruption applies to MNREGS as well. We will investigate and act on any complaints that we might receive from villages,” said the state government spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lapses-surface-as-mnregs-expands-govt-acts-tough/story-yZZeaewdC2VObJQEpCVTfP.html

21-06-2020||Lifestyle||International Yoga Day: Celebrate the fervour virtually||Over the last few years, International Yoga Day (June 21) had become a much sought-after affair with denizens thronging iconic places such as the India Gate or Lodhi Gardens to practise an asana or two. Not to lose the charm of imbibing this age old practice of yoga, due to social distancing being followed during the pandemic, most of the ministries, public departments, not for profit organisations and even individuals decided to celebrate the day virtually. Ministry of Ayush, Government of India, started a campaign called Yoga at Home, Yoga with Family, to encourage the practice of yoga to counter the effects of coronavirus. The official handle of the ministry had recently tweeted: “Share your pictures of practising Yoga as per common Yoga Protocol on 21st June with “#IdoYogaAtHome.” The posts on this handle also has links for those who want to practice the art of yoga.Manoj Shrivastava, a Delhi-based businessman, says, “I used to attend the event at India Gate every year with my family, it was a different feeling to practice yoga at wee hours of the day, but this year because of coronavirus, we have had to change the plan. We woke up at 5am and did surya namaskar at home, which is the most beneficial asana.”Public service departments such as Delhi Police also put up virtual sessions for their staff. RP Meena, DCP, South, says, “We planned to do yoga in each of the police stations and district head quarter, South-East District. There was a bigger programme planned at the District Park in Jasola, and all the police stations were connected through video conferencing with the central location district park.”Practising yoga isn’t just beneficial for the body, but has even been proven beneficial for the mind. It has been reported that yoga it helps in dealing with mental stress and anxiety. Constable Omprakash, who was tested corona positive and recovered, shares, “Everyday while recovering I used to do practice yoga, and it not just helped me recover from the virus but also helped me maintain my sanity. There was so much negative news around me, and I was keeping all of it at bay with the help of yoga and meditation.”Even those working with the differently-abled say that yoga via virtual platforms has helped them in keeping the differently-abled active. Mumbai-based Gauri Singh, who conducts yoga session with differently-abled kids at NGO Gharkul, says, “Being associated with the specially-abled kids for almost a year, I have realised that yoga is one of the ways to help them. I have seen a positive change in their day to day activities due to yoga. Every differently-abled child needs special attention since their attention span is quite less; so taking a group session becomes impossible. To be able to behave one like them, we have been conducting virtual yoga sessions, and did so on the International Yoga Day as well. For these kids, yoga helps coordinate the activities of the mind, body and emotions, and even helps build their focus and concentration.”Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/international-yoga-day-celebrate-the-fervour-virtually/story-fb1yQwGbPOthEiXLW8uDVJ.html
21-06-2020||Chandigarh||Mohali factory blaze: Equipment not upgraded, says fire dept||Mohali : A plastic products factory which was partly gutted in a fire on Saturday at Industrial Area, Phase 9, Mohali, did not have safety measures in place, a fire department report revealed on Sunday. The unit, Accutex Sales and Services, had outdated fire extinguishers. It also lacked a smoke detection alarm, illuminated exit sign, smoke check door, fire control room or fire lifts with fireman’s switch that allows firefighters to disconnect power from high voltage devices. No hose reels to spray water were installed.The fire broke out at around 6 pm, an hour after all 30 workers had left the premises .“We will submit the report to the municipal corporation commissioner on Monday and will also issue notices to the factory owner. The building lacked fire equipment. Also the exact reason for the fire is yet is ascertained though we suspect it was due to a short-circuit,” said fire officer Karam Chand Sood.Factory owner Paras Shah claimed that they had suffered losses of ₹25 lakh. On asking about fire safety measures adopted by the unit, he said, “We had fire extinguishers and sand, but no worker was present so it could not be used.”Fire tragedies: No lessons learnt in MohaliThe recent fire tragedies seem to have had no impact on the authorities, even after a safety audit following the Surat coaching centre fire tragedy in May last year revealed several violations in most of its commercial establishments.After submitting its report to the Mohali to deputy commissioner in June last year, the fire department also issued 200 notices to commercial establishments falling under its jurisdiction on June 14 last year seeking compliance with fire safety norms. They were warned their water and sewerage connections would be snapped.No action, however was taken.The revised rules as per National Building Code 2016 require staircases at the rear of showrooms, something that cannot be done in the existing structures.That’s why “we cannot give no-objection certificates (NoC) until the bye-laws are relaxed. There is no way to tackle the issue,” Sood had said last year.The fire department report had identified 500 commercial establishments in Mohali, Kharar and Kurali which were not complying with fire safety norms and included coaching centres, hotels and other showrooms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mohali-factory-blaze-equipment-not-upgraded-says-fire-dept/story-1mkvqlgIOeYcwVJ1CLj1iL.html

21-06-2020||Delhi||Rains, cloudy weather keep mercury in check in Delhi||Light rains and cloudy weather kept the maximum temperature in check in the national capital on Sunday as the weatherman predicted more downpour till the onset of the monsoon in the city.These rains are a result of a trough extending from Pakistan to Assam, crossing over north Rajasthan and southern Uttar Pradesh, said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the regional forecasting centre of the India Meteorological Department.A western disturbance is also active over north Pakistan and Jammu and Kashmir, he said.The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative figures for the city, recorded a maximum of 36.6 degrees Celsius, two notches below the normal. On Saturday, the city recorded a high of 38.1 degrees Celsius.  The humidity levels oscillated between 62 and 92 per cent.The maximum temperature will hover around 35 degrees Celsius for the next three-four days, Srivastava said.Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting service, said rains will continue on and off till the onset of the monsoon around June 24-25.This means the national capital is likely to witness light showers in the morning and towards the evening for a few days, he said.According to weather experts, the monsoon is likely to arrive in Delhi two-three days earlier than its usual date of June 27 because of a cyclonic circulation over West Bengal and its neighbourhood areas which then moved towards southwest Uttar Pradesh on June 19 and June 20.“It helped in further advancement of the monsoon, which has reached eastern Uttar Pradesh and central Madhya Pradesh. It is expected to reach west Uttar Pradesh and some parts of Uttarakhand by June 22,” Srivastava said.Thereafter, it will make an onset in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab within the next two-three days, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rains-cloudy-weather-keep-mercury-in-check-in-delhi/story-hsPFV2ULGryzgBYNGe2DcI.html

He said that the recent violent face-off was China’s attempt to unilaterally change status quo on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). “However, PM Modi said that no one has entered the Indian territory,” he said.The assertion contradicted government statements about the circumstances in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. Later, the PMO sought to clarify that the PM meant that there was no Chinese presence on our side of the LAC and Indian soldiers had foiled an attempted transgression at the Galwan Valley. “This is nothing less than a blunder in foreign diplomacy as it gives the Chinese an opportunity to put the blame on India,” Sharma said.The Congress leaders said that the Chinese side of the LAC is also officially the Indian territory. ‘GOVT DENYING COMMUNITY SPREAD OF COVID-19’Sharma said that coronavirus has entered community spread phase in India but the government is still in denial mode. “With over 4 lakh Covid-19 cases and nearly 10,000 deaths in country, it is inconceivable that the virus is not spreading in the community.However, the government continuing to insist that there is no community spread is misleading and gives people false hope,” he alleged.Sharma said that according experts both the numbers are rapidly increasing and are expected to reach peak in next two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centre-feeding-lies-to-people-is-in-denial-mode-hp-cong-leader/story-KLokuyxEtLgx9Ld32nKs5O.html

Kathua district authorities, however, suspected that the man, who was suffering from a liver ailment, might have died of sudden “cardiac arrest”.Kathua district commissioner OP Bhagat said, “On June 15, the man returned from Mumbai and his samples were taken for the mandatory Covid 19 test, the next day. On June 17 he complained of liver-related problems coupled with palpitation. We took him to the government medical college where doctors examined him and the doctors found his condition satisfactory.”However, this morning he died, probably of heart attack, the DC added.He said that a magisterial probe has been ordered into his death and ADC Atul Gupta shall submit a report within 15 days.The body has been shifted to the mortuary of GMC in Kathua town.Following his death, other inmates in the quarantine centre staged a protest and alleged that 8 to 10 people have been kept in a single room in unhygienic conditions. Some of them even tried to block the passage to the ambulance.Bhagat said that following the death, people, who usually were reluctant to get quarantined, have got an opportunity to level allegations.It may be stated here that Vimal Zadoo, 38 and Vipin Zadoo, 35, two young Kashmiri Pandits died in Tawi river bed on Thursday where they had gone to cremate the body of their relative.They died due to apathy of the officials present at the site, who didn’t even provide water to them under the scorching sun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-man-dies-of-heart-attack-hours-before-leaving-quarantine-centre-in-kathua-district/story-l2xmoF1U8F7GVbgIxCisBL.html

21-06-2020||City||Post-criticism J&K admn says ‘no policy decision on fresh liquor licences’||The administration’s plan of opening 67 liquor shops across Kashmir has caused public resentment in the valley with local organisations and common people terming it as a conspiracy.Recently an order from the government’s excise department seeking approval of opening of liquor shops at different places from the finance department went viral on social media. The excise department had even identified 67 locations in Kashmir where these liquor shops would be established.This order has caused strong resentment within the people and social and religious groups who vowed to oppose the decision tooth and nail. Sensing the mood, the administration clarified that the decision will only be implemented after taking all the stakeholders into confidence.“The finance department has clarified and urged everyone not to believe any rumours or half baked news,” J&K administration spokesperson and principal secretary, Rohit Kansal said in a tweet.“The finance department has not taken any policy decision regarding issuance of fresh liquor licenses in unserved areas. No list of unserved areas has either been considered or approved. No decision will be taken without the participation of stakeholders and due process,’’ he tweeted.Many people questioned the administration to clarify whether its order circulating on social media is fake. “This is unfortunate that when we are perturbed with drugs in Kashmir, the administration is planning to open the liquor shops. We will oppose this move and will never allow this to happen as it’s going to ruin our young generation,’’ said Khursheed Ahmad, who runs a social organisation in north Kashmir.Zaffar Iqbal Manhas, a former legislator and senior leader of the J&K Apni Party said that the administration’s proposal to open liquor shops at around 183 newly identified locations in J&K including 67 in Kashmir valley is totally unacceptable as the decision is bound to have disastrous consequences for peace in the region.Manhas said the pretext of generating much-needed revenue from the liquor business in the backdrop of an economic crisis brought about by Covid-19 does not hold water as J&K is one of the progressive states in the country.“There are other states like Gujarat, Bihar, Nagaland, Mizoram, and Lakshadweep which are coping with the lockdown despite a ban on liquor sale and consumption. Why choose predominantly Muslim areas of Kashmir Valley for opening large scale liquor sale points when there is no such requirement?” he asked.Former PDP leader and now chairman of Jammu and Kashmir Civil Society Forum, Abdul Qayoom Wani also termed it a dangerous move. ‘’We are trying to get our youth deviated from drug addiction and now attempts are being made to corrupt our society especially the young generation.’’Mutahida Majlish-e- Ulema, an amalgam of different religious organisations led by Hurriyat chairman, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq strongly condemned the move and said that they will never allow this to take place. “The administration’s order states that they are planning to open 67 liquor shops in Kashmir which are of great concern to people. In the midst of the major global pandemic, the government is bringing ordinances and rules to change the demography of the Muslim majority of the state and fresh orders are aimed in assaulting our Muslim majority and religious sentiments.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/locals-organisations-people-oppose-opening-of-liquor-shops-in-kashmir/story-7ZZU8vSf9G30czfWpWYmMO.html

21-06-2020||Chandigarh||Behbal Kalan firing: Advocate, car dealer sent to 3-day police custody||The court of duty magistrate Amandeep Kaur sent advocate Sohail Singh Brar and Moga based car dealer Pankaj Bansal to three-day police custody for their alleged role in fabricating evidence in the Behbal Kalan police firing on Sunday.The special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 firings on people protesting the Bargari sacrilege in Faridkot arrested Bansal, a former witness in the case, for allegedly helping some policemen deliberately fire at and leave bullet marks on the escort vehicle of Charanjit Singh Sharma, former Moga senior superintendent of police and an accused in the case. Brar was arrested on June 16 under similar charges.SIT adds abetment section to FIRThe SIT on Sunday added section 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to the FIR filed in 2018.District attorney (DA) Rajnish Goyal, who appeared for SIT, told the court that new facts emerging during Brar’s interrogation led to Bansal’s arrest. Police remand was required for “Brar and Bansal to dig out the names of all conspirators. We cannot disclose fresh developments in the case as this information will be used during cross interrogation of both accused,” Goyal added. When defence counsel Gursahib Singh Brar argued against custodial interrogations, saying Brar and Bansal had appeared before SIT whenever required, the DA said Brar had not cooperated with the SIT during his four-day custody. Bansal too was not cooperating, he added. The defence also pleaded that as the accused were not present at the Behbal Kalan firing spot they could be booked under section 201 and 109 of IPC, both bailable offences. To this, the DA said they were also accused of criminal conspiracy in a murder case so section 120B (criminal conspiracy) applied to the case and the sections could not be bifurcated as investigations were in progress.The prosecution also said no mention was made of two persons killed in the Behbal Kalan firing incident in the FIR by the accused cops in 2015 to cover up facts.Brar was presented before the court after his four-day police custody finished on Sunday.Findings of the probeThe SIT in its probe found that Charanjit Sharma had conspired with three other police officers: Fazilka superintendent of police Bikramjit Singh, inspector Pardip Singh and sub-inspector Amarjit Singh Kular, to cover up facts related to the Behbal Kalan firing.SIT has claimed that to fabricate false evidence against the peaceful protesters, Sharma’s escort Maruti Gypsy was taken to the advocate’s house, where Bikramjit Singh had fired at it, leaving bullet marks. The same day, Kular, who was the Bajakhana station house officer, recorded the statements of Sharma, Bikramjit Singh and Pardip Singh among others, in which they claimed that police fired in self-defence after protestors attacked them.A case was registered against the policemen (then unidentified) under Section 302 (murder) and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code on October 21, 2017. Names of the four policemen, including Sharma, were added in the FIR on August 11, 2018.Photos: Accused outside Fardikot judicial complex on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/behbal-kalan-firing-advocate-car-dealer-sent-to-3-day-police-custody/story-BooGIJ6vvonSchfJh1F0PP.html
21-06-2020||Pune||More suicide deaths reported in May as compared to past two months||The Pune police recorded more deaths by suicide in May 2020 as compared to the previous two months in the city. Officials say that 54 such cases were registered in May and 26 in April this year as compared to 60 such cases in May and 64 in April last year.While police have attributed “family connect” as the reason for fewer cases in April and March, psychiatrists cite Covid-19 induced financial distress for disturbing mental health issues post May.“We studied the cases in the light of the recent death by suicide of a couple, who are also suspected to have killed their two children. They left a message stating that ‘nobody is to be blamed for this as they are taking the drastic step due to prevailing situation’,” officials said.The family of four was found dead on Friday, while another 45-year-old businessman was also reported to have died by suicide on Friday. The couple was among the 42 suicide deaths reported in June. The number of suicide deaths in June 2019 in Pune was 47, while till June 19 this year, 42 cases have already been reported.“The main reason for less number of cases in March and April as compared to May is the support of family due to the lockdown, since family support may help fight suicidal tendencies. The reasons for suicide vary from loneliness, depression, financial penury, loss of jobs, problems in relationships among others, but there is no particular trend as it depends on the temperament of a person,” said Bachchan Singh, deputy commissioner of police, crime branch, Pune.“Prima facie, proximity to family members gives people moral support and helps fight suicidal tendencies. More research needs to be done to understand the phenomenon,” said Singh.Dr Saumitra Pathare, director, Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy, Indian Law Society, believes that the data cannot be used to draw any conclusion.“It is good to know that the numbers are low, but what we do need is numbers for the entire country. The present data covers a small area and does not represent the society,” said Dr Pathare.Dr Harshad Bhagat, a psychiatrist, said, “People have lost their purpose during the lockdown period. A lot of the people were either daily wage workers or had something that kept them driven. A vacuum was created which they were not able to fill psychologically.”“Another reason could be that few people may have had psychiatric issues that were not met with proper help. A lot of people have been calling me for online prescription in absence of physical access to their regular doctors,” he said.Dr Pathare, who works as a consultant psychiatrist and has helped chart mental health policy of various countries, believes that more exhaustive data is required to reach any conclusion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/more-suicide-deaths-reported-in-may-as-compared-to-past-two-months/story-PdoxA8Xhk9pxo7p9uleA4N.html
21-06-2020||Pune||Partial solar eclipse wows Punekars, but cloudy skies hinder stunning views||An annular solar eclipse, wherein the Sun appears like a ring of fire, had been the prime focus of Punekars on Sunday. While the annular eclipse was visible between 10:19 am and 2.02 pm within a narrow corridor in the northern part of the country (parts of Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttarakhand), the city witnessed a partial solar eclipse.Several online programmes were organised by scientific institutes and astronomy groups in the city for students and public to observe the celestial event as residents went to their terraces to witness it. Residents used solar goggles, x-ray sheets or even mobile phones to watch the eclipse shadow image on the screen. However, cloudy skies played a spoilsport for some residents.Professor Somak Raychaudhury, director of Inter-University of Astronomy and Astrophysics (Iucaa), said, “Eclipses are very rare events and occur when the sun, moon and the earth play shadows with each other. The sun is the source of the light and if one of the two come in between the shadow, the other is eclipsed. They rare events because not much in the sky changes on an hourly or daily basis and that is why such rare events are wonderful to look forward to and to experience. Anybody who has seen an eclipse of the sun can never forget it in their lives. This year, we had an annular solar eclipse which is also an uncommon event, it was not a total eclipse but we can see the ring of fire and that is because of the relative sizes of the moon and sun on the sky. Residents should dispel fears about eclipses and enjoy watching the event with precautions.”Solar Eclipse 2020: Watch captivating images of the ‘ring of fire’ from across the country Iucaa shared live observations and experiences of different eclipses in the form of short videos on their YouTube channel, whereas the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune’s (IISER) science activity centre organised a live seminar ‘Solar Eclipse – A play of Shadow’ with scientist professor Prasad Subramanian, faculty at IISER, Pune. The seminar was for schoolchildren and teachers across the city and more than 5,000 children, teachers attended it.Ashok Rupner, programme manager at science activity centre, IISER, Pune, said, “We have conducted a live demonstration to explain the concept behind Sunday’s annular solar eclipse for schoolchildren and teachers from Classes 5 to 10. Various concepts were explained by the scientist to the students like size of the moon, earth and sun, how far are they from each other.”“There are two kinds of shadows, if you are in the umbra zone, then, you can see the total or annular solar eclipse. However, if you are in the penumbral zone then you witness a partial eclipse and Pune comes in the penumbral zone, so we observed a partial solar eclipse, around 60 per cent of the eclipse. There was great response to the live demonstration of the eclipse and students asked several questions,” he added.Vedashree Dangat, a student who observed the solar eclipse from Pune, said, “I was waiting for this day and was excited to see Sunday’s eclipse. Astronomy is my favourite subject and I have read a lot about the different types of eclipses and to witness it live is something for which we have to wait for years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/partial-solar-eclipse-wows-punekars-but-cloudy-skies-hinder-stunning-views/story-DFp0LUU1For4e9NLQeOgpO.html
21-06-2020||Pune||Socialising during Covid: Online ‘kattas’ keeps Puneites connected in spite of restrictions||The ‘katta culture’, a tradition of meeting up at a particular place, catching up over a cup of tea or coffee and holding a freewheeling discussion, has stood the test of time even during the restrictions implemented during Covid-19 pandemic.Restaurants like Vaishali, Roopali, Wadeshwar, Café Goodluck – all located on Fergusson College road – have been some of the popular places where katta groups often meet. During lockdown when cafes, tea stalls, restaurants and gardens were closed, these katta groups managed to meet via online platforms and also empty apartments, while maintaining all social distancing norms and following safety precautions.Morning star is one such group, which has been meeting every morning at Vaishali since the past 30 years. “The Covid hasn’t stopped us from meeting. We now communicate online and continue with our regular day,” said Sanjay Deshpande, a real estate developer, who is a part of this 20-member group, which celebrated members’ birthday online during the lockdown.Not all kattas are about fun as some are about exchanging crucial information too. Vijay Kumbhar, Right To Information (RTI) activist, began his ‘RTI katta’ at Chitranjan Vatika, Model Colony, in 2014 to share information about subjects he was pursuing. During the lockdown, this katta went online while expanding its scope nationally as the platform allowed everyone interested to participate in it.“With no geographical barrier, many people from outside Maharashtra have started participating as we began meeting online during the lockdown,” said Kumbhar.Another group that used to meet outside Roopali since the past 10 years found another way to continue with their daily routine. As the government imposed restrictions, members of this unnamed group started meeting in an unoccupied apartment with all precautions and social distancing norms in place. Rashida Khilawalla, who has been part of the group, said, “Our group discusses everything from personal life to the stock market, Bollywood, to our dreams and ideas. The group is like a support system.” His friend Sanmegh Sontakke, also a part of the group, said meeting people is an essential daily dose they require. “The group, for me, lies between family and friendship. It is my therapy and the biggest challenge to my patience.”Omkar Thatte, a television content creator and a member of two kattas, one which meets at Roopali and one at café Goodluck, said, “There is a big difference in the two katta groups that I am part of; Café Goodluck consists of people from drama, film and television, with subjects revolving around them, we are a fleeting group though the core is of five members, but there is a lot of attachment.”“At Roopali, there are members from all walks of life. One member is a software CEO, while another is an executive film producer, and another is an interior decorator and we talk on random subjects. I am meeting them here for the past two years,” said Thatte.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/socialising-during-covid-online-kattas-keeps-puneites-connected-in-spite-of-restrictions/story-p4ofOmiB740c8lURY7e9VI.html
21-06-2020||Pune||Doubling rate slows down, but more positive cases per 100 tests||The city’s doubling rate of progressive positive Covid-19 (coronavirus) cases has slowed to 24 days as of June 19, according to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) projection. The previous doubling rate was 19 days on June 9, five days on April 11 and 14 days on May 21.However, the city’s positive rate — number of confirmed cases per 100 tests — has gone up from earlier 10 per cent to 13 per cent as of June 19. The figure is, however, much less than Maharashtra’s current rate of 20.58 per cent.While PMC’s projection about doubling rate brings hope, increased positive rate indicates that the civic body is not conducting as many tests despite having a larger capacity, politicians say.Rubal Aggarwal, additional municipal commissioner, said, “Based on the current average growth rate, it would take 23 days for the progressive positive cases to double and 26 days for the active cases to double.”Opposition member and Congress party corporator Arvind Shinde said, “Despite the fact that Pune has more capacity to carry out tests, PMC is not conducting tests to check positive cases.”Dr Vijay Natrajan, chief executive officer, Symbiosis Hospital, said, “As the lockdown opens up, it is expected that the number of cases will rise. Currently, the government should focus more on bringing down the mortality rate.”“PMC is doing a satisfactory job by tracking vulnerable people like comorbid patients, pregnant women and senior citizens. However, it is natural that a certain number of people are likely to get critically infected due to the virus and the government should focus more on bringing down the mortality rate by hiring experts and build up infrastructure for critical care,” said Dr Natrajan.As per the information on PMC smart city dashboard, the city’s progressive positive cases stand at 11,115 with 3,722 active cases. Out of the 81,511 tests conducted, over 13.6 per cent tested positive for the virus which earlier in the month of May the number stood at around 10 per cent. The figure indicates that as the number of tests rises, the number of sample testing positives also rises. The current average is 13 samples testing positive for every 100 samples.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/doubling-rate-slows-down-but-more-positive-cases-per-100-tests/story-vZWl4UySuEzUlBQ1Xyjp2I.html

Till June 20, the city recorded 151.6mm rainfall, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The excessive rainfall was due to the impact of cyclone Nisarga, which hit the state int he first week of week, according to IMD officials.“There are three reasons due to which Pune has received more than normal rainfall in just 20 days, that is cyclonic rains due to Nisarga, good moisture incursion and normal onset of monsoon,” said Anupam Kashyapi, IMD director.

21-06-2020||Pune||IISER, Pune uses activity-based videos to engage students||If the lockdown posed a major challenge before kids and their parents, the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) has found an innovative way to engage students and teachers in hands-on learning.The Indrani Balan Science Activity Centre (SAC) at IISER took a lead to create basic activity-based videos on science and mathematics that is keeping students engaged and providing them with a learning experience. The centre is dedicated to training teachers and conducting workshops for making science fun through various hands-on activities and teaching aids using readily available, inexpensive material for children.“These activities explore concepts in science and mathematics in an engaging manner. So far, we have developed and uploaded images with stepwise instructions for over 150 activities. These activities explore various concepts in science and mathematics from state and other education boards’ syllabi for grades five to ten,” said Ashok Rupner, senior teaching assistant, IISER.So far around 1 lakh students have engaged in these activities from Pune and outside with most of them in the age bracket of 11 to 16 years. Along with students, around 1,000 teachers benefited from online activities, according to IISER.According to Rupner, activities in physics explore electricity, magnetism, electromagnetism, optics, air expansion, contraction, force, motion, gravitation, buoyancy, heat, pressure, and sound. Concepts in chemistry, biology, and mathematics are also documented.These activities have benefitted students, especially now when most schools are either still closed or operating partially through an online medium. Presently, instructions in these activities are in English. The centre is working on translating them to Marathi.Deepali Vikram Tare, science teacher with Acharya Shree Vijay Vallabh secondary school is one of them to have used these activities for teaching her classes online.“These online activities help simplify the notions of science and maths and make it interesting for them. As all activity videos demonstrated by IISER has a scientific base, understanding the principle was easy and it has helped us to teach students by conducting the same activity as done by IISER,” said Tare.Yash Kelkar, an eight standard student said it was a great experience for him and his brother. “My brother and I both watched the session based on air pressure together. It was full of experiments which are very simple and very easy to do at home. We made a model vasudev cup as the material is readily available at our home. When the experiment was completed, we were very happy, and had a feeling that we can do it,” Kelkar said. All activities conducted by IISER were related to school textbooks and material required for doing these activities was available at home. Since the material was available at home, conducting these activities and asking students to do it at home was easily possible.“It was really a nice experience for me when my child was doing the experiment. It is very useful for him and brainstorming activity. It also reminded me of my childhood days. I am very thankful to IISER Team for such demonstrative sessions,” said Anagha Kelkar, mother of Yash Kelkar||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/iiser-pune-uses-activity-based-videos-to-engage-students/story-guGHXatjQ5N0eW5kgdM08J.html

From about 10.20 am, a fairly bright sky enabled the gazers in Chennai, Madurai, Tiruchirapalli, Coimbatore, Salem, Tirunelveli and other parts of the state to witness the celestial occurrence. “We were able to get a clear view and could even record the celestial event till the peak of the eclipse at noon.Later, the sky became cloudy and the eclipse could not be seen from here,” said S Joseph Winston, Head, Remote Handling and Irradiation Experiments Division, Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research,Kalpakkam.Solar Eclipse 2020: Watch captivating images of the ‘ring of fire’ from across the country As people had to remain indoors owing to the lockdown being enforced to prevent the spread of Coronavirus, he had made arrangements for live streaming of the event. “The visibility of the eclipse was hampered due to clouds in most parts of Tamil Nadu. Some people in the metro and other parts, too, who had solar filters, had attempted to see the partial eclipse from the terrace of their houses,” an official of the district science centre, said.The obscuration of the sun by the moon during the greatest phase of the annular eclipse was nearly 34 per cent in Chennai, he said. “From noon onwards, the clouds blocked the view and nothing much was witnessed,” Joseph said and added that he had used polymer filters to capture images from a telescope.Down south, in Tirunelveli, an official of the District Science Centre, said the centre was opened only to observe the rare phenomenon, but members of the public were however barred from viewing at the centre due to the lockdown. “We captured the images and uploaded them on our social networking sites,” he added.This is the first solar eclipse of this year and it coincides with the summer solstice, when the Northern Hemisphere has the longest day. The eclipse started by 10:22 am and ended at around 2 pm. Temples including the Lord Venkateswara temple in T Nagar here remained closed due to solar eclipse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/tamil-nadu/cloudy-skies-obstruct-solar-eclipse-in-chennai-parts-of-tamil-nadu/story-xozulP7rxfhqs82ebYcKZJ.html

21-06-2020||Ranchi||Jharkhand to launch job guarantee scheme for urban poor||Jharkhand is set to launch a 100-day employment scheme for urban unskilled workers similar to the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) amid the coronavirus pandemic and increasing unemployment, officials said on Sunday.A brainchild of Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren, the scheme will be known as Mukhyamantri SHRAMIK (Shahri Rozgar Manjuri For Kamgar) Yojna, which is aimed at enhancing livelihood security for urban poor.Jharkhand will be the second state in the country after Kerala to launch an employment guarantee scheme for the urban poor. Kerala runs Ayyankali Urban Employment Guarantee Scheme (AUEGS).“Formulation of the scheme has been done. The scheme will be rolled out once it gets approval from the state cabinet,” Vinay Kumar Choubey, Jharkhand’s urban development secretary, saidLike MGNREGS, the scheme will also have a provision for unemployment allowance, if any urban local body fails to provide work to job seekers within 15 days, Choubey said.A worker will be entitled to one-fourth of the wages for the first 30 days of unemployment and it will be half in the second month. If the worker does not get a job for third, they will be entitled to equal to basic minimum wage, officials said.“They will be given priority in the existing schemes. If they could not be accommodated in existing schemes, exclusives schemes for the purpose will be created and ULBs would be given separate funds for this. There are lots of opportunities of jobs in urban areas right from sanitation work to development projects,” Choubey said.Like labourers in MGNREGS, urban workers will also be registered and they would be provided job cards. “A special website is also being designed, similar to the website functions in MGNREGS,” Choubey said.The scheme will be conducted by the urban development and housing department through the state urban livelihood mission. Municipal commissioners, executive offices or special officer of municipal bodies will be the nodal officer of the scheme.Economists have appreciated the concept of the scheme and said it became necessary after the influx of migrant workers to the state.“Till now there was a notion that poor means rural people. So, a lot of poor alleviation schemes were launched for rural areas. However, there is also a chunk of urban poor and they also need job guarantee like in rural areas,” Harishwar Dayal, a Jharkhand-based economist, said.“The new scheme will help the migrant workers who returned to urban Jharkhand after corona outbreak,” Dayal added.More than five lakh migrant workers stuck outside the state returned to Jharkhand since May 1 during the coronavirus pandemic. The state rural development department has done a skill mapping of 2.5 lakh workers and it revealed that 30% of workers who returned from different states are unskilled labourers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/jharkhand-to-launch-job-guarantee-scheme-for-urban-poor/story-HZoPx11omvIMknSrz355vI.html

Police said the couple, who lived alone, had hired a security guard about a fortnight ago, who is missing. Their house was ransacked and investigators suspect robbery as a motive behind the killing, senior officers said. According to the police, the incident took place after 8pm when a few men gained friendly entry into the house and attacked the woman. They said they were informed late night around 9:30pm when the husband managed to alert neighbours who called the PCR.“It looks like the woman was killed because she tried to raise alarm to alert others living on the floors above. Her husband who is 94 years old can’t speak or move properly because of the old age and was therefore just tied up,” an investigator, who wished not to be named, said. “The house is ransacked and prima facie, robbery seems to be a reason behind the murder,” the investigator added.Police have found that the couple had a domestic help working at their house.“With her help, the couple had hired a security guard about a fortnight ago. He is missing. During the preliminary probe, three men were seen escaping in CCTV footages. One of them is possibly the security guard. The security guard was not verified by the police,” the officer added.

21-06-2020||Patna||Bihar CM Nitish Kumar lauds PM’s employment scheme for migrant workers||Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday hailed an employment scheme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for migrant workers, saying it will boost the state’s efforts to generate jobs at home for people who had to return due to the coronavirus lockdown. Modi on Saturday launched the ‘Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyaan’ with an outlay of Rs 50,000 crore for migrant workers who returned to their home states during the coronavirus-induced lockdown.The prime minister launched the scheme via video conference in a village in Khagaria district of Bihar in the presence of Kumar and the chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and a minister from Odisha.Kumar, who attended the function via video conference from Telihar panchayat in Khagaria, sought exemptions in GST and Income Tax as a special assistance to promote industries in the state.He said the Centre should increase the limit of Rs 25,000 crore fund allotted to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) to promote the sector in Bihar.Kumar also stressed on increasing the existing banks CD (credit deposit) ratio of 43 per cent in the state by enhancing the size of annual credit plan, the issue which he had raised at a recently-held State Level Bankers Committee meeting in Patna. The scheme will be implemented on a mission mode in 125 days in 116 districts of six states -- Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha -- that received the maximum numbers of migrant workers back.In Bihar, the scheme will be implemented in 32 out of the total 38 districts, the chief minister said.Kumar, in his speech, highlighted that his government provided Rs 1,000 special assistance to more than 21 lakh distressed people who were stranded outside the state during the lockdown, besides running quarantine centres with proper health facilities.He said more than 20 lakh natives of the state returned their home in more than 15,000 ‘Shramik Special’ trains during the coronavirus crisis.Kumar, who had an interaction with people in quarantine centres across the state via video conference, said people informed him that they suffered a lot and hence they do not want to return to other states where they were employed, instead they want to work in Bihar.“Our government’s efforts will be to ensure that no one goes outside the state in ‘majboori’ (compulsion) for work. We will try to give them the work in the state itself,” he said.The chief minister said people are being provided opportunities under MNREGA, road construction and other development work such as seven resolves, Jal-Jiwan-Hariyali etc.Under the ‘Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan’, the Centre will spend Rs 3.43 crore per panchayat, he informed, while stating that the state government will spend Rs 2.30 crore in Telihar panchayat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-cm-nitish-kumar-lauds-pm-s-employment-scheme-for-migrant-workers/story-Xlu5beyffVyn4QXmyAzYbJ.html
21-06-2020||Delhi||Health care workers try to balance their fatherly duties between COVID duties||The thought of being away from your kids is difficult, but for front line male doctors, this has become a reality. From warm hugs to bedtime stories, we all have cherished these moments at some point in our lives. The fatherly duties have taken a backseat in the wake of duties they took up as medical professionals. Male health care workers are trying to cope with the fact of being physically distant from their kids while trying to balance their fatherly duties.Dr Shuchin Bajaj of internal medicine department at a South- Delhi hospital, who has been craving the warm greetings and hugs from his kids, says, “I have a 16-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. They both understand the situation but still there is always a constant fear that runs in my mind that what if I am transmitting the virus to my kids. I have forgotten when was the last time we watched a movie or show on TV together. Life has become an emergency drill. It’s highly fulfilling to serve your nation at this time of need. I haven’t been able to attend the digital parents meet from last three-four months because they usually happen during my operating hours. But during this time also, I am trying to give my best to my kids. I try to utilize the time with my family as I know I can just spend limited time with them. It is very hard to express those feelings as a father, who can’t hug his children or spend some time with them. They are sacrificing a lot during this time, so whatever time I get at home, I try to just spend it with my kids now.”Being away from kids is very difficult but at the same time, it is a necessity for these doctors. Dr Akhilesh Yadav, orthopaedic surgeon, says that his sons have adapted with this lifestyle of him going out for COVID duty.“As a father, at least the last three to four months have been very difficult with restricted ‘family time’. I have two sons, one is seven years old and the other is 12-years-old. Recently, both of them have gotten into the habit of getting up early because of me and we try to have breakfast together before I leave for work. Though I take all the precautions while I step out but still there is a fear in the mind. Before the pandemic, the warm greetings and hugs that I used to get when I returned from the hospital are missing now. It was tough during the initial lockdown to make them understand the importance of social distancing, self hygiene and the time that I need to provide to the affected and those in need, but gradually, he has understood this very well,” he says.Read: International Yoga Day 2020: A virtual Yoga Day celebration in Texas and other American statesAnd for Dr Saurabh Nanda, an anesthesiologist, it is all about doing that one activity with his kids everyday.“As healthcare workers, we are very much exposed to the virus everyday. Everytime, we head out of the house, there is a risk. All the time, there is fear in my mind that I might carry something back from the hospital. I have a separate room in my house which has an exit, so I mostly operate from that room only. We all have one specific thing, which is like a routine with our kids and for me, it is teaching my three-year-old daughter.

21-06-2020||Delhi||Annular solar eclipse underway, cloudy skies may play spoilsport for sky gazers in Delhi||An annular solar eclipse, wherein the Sun appears like a ring of fire, is currently underway but cloudy skies are likely to play a spoilsport for sky gazers in the national capital.  The annular phase began at 10:19 am and will end at 2.02 pm.The annular phase was visible on Sunday morning from some places within a narrow corridor of northern part of the country (parts of Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttarakhand). Few prominent places within this narrow annularity path are Dehradun, Kurukshetra, Chamoli, Joshimath, Sirsa, Suratgarh.It will be seen as a partial solar eclipse from the rest part of the country.The annular path also passes through Congo, Sudan, Ethiopia, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Pakistan, and China.Obscuration of the Sun by the Moon at the time of greatest phase of partial eclipse will be around 94 per cent in Delhi.N Rathnashree, Director of Nehru Planetarium, said visibility of the eclipse is being hampered due to solar eclipse.  The next annular eclipse will be seen from South America in December 2020. Another annular eclipse will occur in 2022, but that it will be hardly visible from India, Rathnashree added.  A solar eclipse occurs on a new moon day when the Moon comes in between the Earth and the Sun and when all the three objects are aligned.  An annular solar eclipse will occur when the angular diameter of the Moon falls short of that of the Sun so that it cannot cover up the latter completely. As a result, a ring of the Sun’s disk remains visible around the Moon. This gives an image of a ring of fire.Rathnashree cautioned that eclipsed Sun should not be viewed with the naked eye, even for a very short time as it can cause permanent damage of the eyes leading to blindness even when the Moon covers most portion of the Sun.  Safe technique to observe the solar eclipse is either by using proper filter like aluminised mylar, black polymer, welding glass of shade number 14 or by making projection of the Sun’s image on a white board by telescope.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/annular-solar-eclipse-underway-cloudy-skies-may-play-spoilsport-for-sky-gazers-in-delhi/story-Lzwdhl5mhOSINqma7sa2dP.html

21-06-2020||Lucknow||UP: Covid-19 tally reaches 17,135; death toll rises to 529||Twenty-two people have succumbed to Covid-19 and 541 more people tested positive in Uttar Pradesh in the last 24 hours, officials said on Saturday. The death toll in the state is 529 now with the coronavirus tally reaching 17,135, they said. Principal Secretary (Health) Amit Mohan Prasad said 10,369 of the total infected have recovered. The state has 6,237 active Covid-19 patients now. Among the 22 new fatalities, five have been reported from Meerut, two each in Kanpur Nagar, Ghaziabad, Varanasi and Hapur, one each in Lucknow, Prayagraj, Sambhal, Mathura, Muzaffarnagar, Etawah, Mainpuri, Farrukhabad and Baghpat, a health department release said. As many as 65 cases were reported from Hapur followed by 55 in Kanpur Nagar, 41 in Gautam Budhnagar, 40 in Ghaziabad and 38 in Lucknow among others, the release said On Friday, 14,048 samples were tested, he said, adding that ASHA workers have tracked over 17 thousand people. Samples of 1,567 of them have been sent for testing, he said. Prasad said that random testing was being carried out in old age homes, orphanages and juvenile homes on the directions of the chief minister. Covid-19 cases have been found in old age homes in Sultanpur, Kushinagar and Jalaun districts and in orphanages and juvenile homes in Meerut and Kanpur. A government spokesman said urban slums were sampled randomly across the state. In the bigger districts, 10 slums were sampled. In the middle size districts, 5 slums per districts and in the smaller districts 2 slums per district were sampled. A total of 311 slums were randomly tested across the state. Thirty slums in 20 districts showed positivity for Covid-19 in pool test. Out of 4,160 samples tested, 75 samples tested positive and the results of 4,085 came out negative. Twenty districts which “showed positivity” are Ambedkar Nagar, Sant Kabir Nagar, Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Sultanpur, Varanasi, Moradabad, Mathura, Shravasti, Aligarh, Auraiya, Badaun, Ballia, Etah, Firozabad, Ghazipur, Jalaun, Kanpur Nagar, Merrut and Gautam Buddha Nagar. Such random sampling is being carried out to map the vulnerability of high risk groups, generate awareness among them and take corrective measures in time to contain the spread of infection, the spokesman said. The chief minister has directed all DMs to take precautionary measures. He has also asked for active contact-tracing and sampling wherever “positivity” has been found in the slums, the spokesman added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-covid-19-tally-reaches-17-135-death-toll-rises-to-529/story-pk3icuDNZnXfpoW9bB3OrL.html
21-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt procuring oxygen cylinders, hospitals need not do it themselves: Report||The Delhi government has said it is in the process of procuring oxygen cylinders and concentrators and directed hospitals under it to not procure them for Covid-19 patients, according to an official order.The government had earlier this month directed medical directors of all the designated Covid hospitals  under the Delhi government to arrange oxygen supply for all hospital beds. However, the government, in supersession of its earlier order, said on Saturday that hospitals may now not procure oxygen concentrators or cylinders.“The Health Department is already in the process of procurement of 18,000 D-type cylinders, 3,000 B-type cylinders and around 3,000 oxygen concentrators centrally,” the order said.“The cylinders and concentrators will be procured shortly and will be allocated to the respective hospitals in a staggered manner as per their requirement and as per the receipt from suppliers,” it said.It is also directed that consumables and ancillary devices such as regulators, breathing circuits, masks, nasal prongs, cannulas, filters, flow metres, trolley stand etc. to make the oxygen cylinders operational may be procured by hospitals as per their need and stock position, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-procuring-oxygen-cylinders-hospitals-need-not-do-it-themselves-report/story-V6b4wba0lVmUx0TCKBISDK.html
21-06-2020||Lucknow||Chasing a dream, he grew apples in this guava belt||Apples – red, pleasantly crisp, sweet and juicy – hanging from tree after tree, but then this is not Himachal Pradesh, but Uttar Pradesh, and to be precise, Rampur village, around 45 km from Prayagraj, in the water-scarce, rocky trans-Yamuna area of Jasra development block.The ‘miracle’ has been made possible because of the drive of a driver-turned-farmer of this Sangam city.Chasing the dream of owning an apple orchard in the district known for growing guavas – on a farmland he inherited a few years back – this 52-year-old farmer has successfully cross-bred Hariman-99 and Anna varieties of apples. Now there are around 35 trees bearing the fruit of his labours.“I inherited some land in Rampur village a few years back and decided to construct a house here around five years back. I had a thought that it would be perfect if I had an apple orchard near my house. However, when I discussed it with others, including my father, Keshav Bahadur Singh, a seasoned farmer, made fun of me,” Rudra Pratap said.“At this time, I was working in Mumbai as a driver. In Mumbai, I came across a farmer from Shimla, who guided me a little on apple farming. Three years back I got 200 apple tree saplings of Hariman-99 and planted them on my farmland but they failed to flourish as I had hoped, Rudra Pratap said, who has just studied up to Class XII.Undeterred, he took the advice of an apple farmer from Kashmir whom he ran into in Mumbai and decided to crossbreed the trees through grafting with an apple variety dubbed ‘Anna’. “This clicked instantly. The grafts flourished within a year. Now, I have 35 trees with apples on them. Now, everyone is keen to visit my orchard and learn how to grow apples on their land. Even my 75-year-old father is helping me tend to the orchard,” said a beaming Rudra Pratap.So what does he do to give his apple saplings the advantage to grow in this rocky village land located on the banks of River Tons. “To protect the trees from moths, mites and other pests, I spray a safe pesticide procured from the local Jari market once a month. I irrigate the trees once every three days to ensure that they have adequate water and humidity using a submersible pump. To protect the trees from the hot winds that blow during summers, I have planted banana trees all around the orchard and it seems to be working perfectly,” added Pratap, whose three children are in Mumbai, including two sons who are employed with a private firm and a daughter pursuing MBA.Horticultural Experiment and Training Centre, Kushrubagh, chief horticulturist Krishna Mohan Chaudhary lauded the efforts of Rudra Pratap. “His efforts are praiseworthy. We have low chilling varieties of apples and efforts are on to grow them in plains, including UP. The quality of apples is judged by taste, texture and fragrance etc, and only after checking these apples on those parameters will we be able to determine the commercial value of the fruits,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/chasing-a-dream-he-grew-apples-in-this-guava-belt/story-VSEUkxOcMiwCqMrcgX4DvK.html
21-06-2020||Lucknow||‘Yoga and health complement each other’: UP CM Adityanath||Ahead of the International Day of Yoga on Sunday, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has said the ancient practice and health complement each other. Immunity increases by practising yoga. If the immunity system of a person is strong then the risk of infection of any virus will be reduced, Adityanath said, amid the coronavirus pandemic. He was addressing an online workshop on yoga organized by Maharana Pratap Shiksha Parishad and Mahayogi Gorakshnath Yoga Institute on Saturday. The chief minister said one should not be afraid of the coronavirus. “It is the weakest virus of the century, only the transmission of this virus is fast. You have to protect yourself from this infection, especially children, elderly and those who are already suffering from any disease are most vulnerable to this infection,” he added. “The functional aspect of yoga is useful for person of every age. Through this, one can gain physical and mental health and understand the secrets of the spiritual world. In order to know the secret of spiritual world, it is necessary to have a healthy body and mind and this is possible only through yoga. Everyone should include yoga in his daily routine,” he said. “Yoga gained global recognition through efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Today, this day is celebrated in more than 200 countries. It also means that India also creates conversation through its heritage with so many countries,” the chief minister said. Due to the ongoing crisis, it is not possible to organize this event in a collective form so practice Yoga with family at homes, he said. “The Union Ministry of AYUSH has issued a common Yoga protocol regarding this. You can upload your photos or videos on that platform while practicing yoga. The central and state governments will also reward good yogis,” he said.

21-06-2020||Delhi||Govt thanks Baijal; Opposition says decision wasn’t wrong||The five-day mandatory institutional quarantine order by Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on Friday evoked sharp responses from across the political spectrum in Delhi with the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) calling it a “dictatorial” decision. The order was, however, withdrawn on Saturday evening after the government held two meetings with Baijal. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia thanked the L-G in a tweet following the announcement. “We have been able to clear all the doubts that the L-G had regarding home isolation. Home isolation will now continue. We thank the L-G for this. Under the leadership of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, we will not allow any Delhi resident to suffer,” Sisodia said in a tweet in Hindi. “In the same order, the L-G had discontinued the services of a private company which had been providing counselling to those under home isolation. For now, the service will continue till Monday. It will be discussed under after the health department is ready with alternatives,” the deputy CM tweeted. During the day, senior AAP leader and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh addressed a press conference and questioned why the L-G was formulating “different rules” for Delhi. “The ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research] guidelines being implemented throughout the country state that Covid positive patients who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms will be allowed to practice home isolation. Why are different rules being formulated for Delhi? This is a dictatorial decision,” he said. Earlier this month, the L-G had disagreed with the state government’s decision allowing only Delhi residents Covid-19 treatment at Delhi government-run hospitals and private ones. Baijal had overruled the Delhi government’s order and instructed hospitals to accept all patients. Referring to the 503 railway coaches deployed as isolation wards across nine stations in Delhi, Singh said these coaches were not in a good condition. “They are like hot furnaces without any air-conditioning. It is not feasible to live there at 47 degree celsius,” he said.But Delhi Congress president Anil Chaudhary said the removal of home isolation had been a repeated demand of his party. “We had suggested the government and L-G that home isolation is not possible for marginalised people. But the government has to make sure there are adequate facilities at quarantine centres so that people don’t suffer,” he said.During the day, BJP Delhi President Adesh Gupta said the L-G’s order was necessary because there were many families in Delhi which stay in one or two-room houses. “In such a scenario, home isolation can be dangerous and can put others living in that house at risk. This is why L-G took the decision,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-thanks-baijal-opposition-says-decision-wasn-t-wrong/story-nXGk5ApSqaXkLOhYhkmODM.html
21-06-2020||Delhi||Efforts on to boost health care infrastructure in Delhi as cases surge||The Delhi government is focusing on ramping up hospital beds and ensuring the availability of medical workers in the backdrop of a steady a rise in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, laying stress on two crucial aspects of the city’s health infrastructure that could define the fight against the infection in the coming days.The national capital recorded 3,630 cases on Saturday — the biggest single-day jump — as its tally reached 56,746 infections.As of Saturday, Delhi had over 12,000 hospital beds for Covid-19 patients across government and private hospitals, according to the data on the “Delhi Corona” app. Authorities also plan to use 77 banquet halls and 40 hotels for treatment of Covid-19 patients, a move that is expected to add about 16,000 more beds to Delhi’s health infrastructure. Then, using railway coaches for treatment will translate to 8,000 additional beds. While the Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee will provide another 850 beds in eight establishments run by it, the government will also create 450 beds in its upcoming hospital in Burari.Of the 12,647 hospital beds available now, 47% are already occupied. While the occupancy rate at government hospitals ins 43% , the beds in private hospitals are 50% full.When it comes to beds equipped with ventilators, the occupancy rate is higher. Almost 69% of all beds with ventilators – both in private and government hospitals – are full. Over 71% of the 368 ventilators in private hospitals are already occupied.At present, only those with severe symptoms such as elevated respiratory rate of over 30 breaths per minute (normal is 12 to 20 breaths per minute) or oxygen saturation of less than 90% (normal is 95 to 100%) have to be admitted to hospitals.People with mild symptoms can remain in home isolation if they have no comorbidities, and have a separate room and a bathroom to follow proper isolation protocols. Those with no such facility can stay in Covid care centres. And those with moderate to severe symptoms are admitted to Covid Health Centres or Covid hospitals as per need. The government estimates 150,000 beds will be required by the end of June. The projection is based on the report of a five-member committee set up in early June, which said the city would record 100,000 cases by the end of the month and need 15,000 beds for those with severe symptoms of the infection.The requirement for beds will go up to over 40,000 by mid-June, according to the committee members. And the number would translate to 80,000 beds by July-end. The government increased the numbers further when it could not restrict the services of its hospitals for Delhi residents.Makeshift hospitals such as railway coaches, however, cannot treat those with severe symptoms of the infection. The challenge for the government is to add more ventilator and ICU beds in its hospitals.The city government has received 200 ventilators from the central government and plans to buy 300 more. It will also ensure that all the beds in the hospitals have oxygen support, according to officials from the department.The state government has also sought the help of central hospitals such as AIIMS and Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital to increase the number of ICU beds. At Lady Hardinge Medical College, two of the large hospital wards are being converted into Covid-19 beds. Almost all the beds in the hospital have oxygen support.“Around 36 beds in our Covid-19 area have oxygen support along with invasive and non-invasive ventilators. The other beds are also all oxygen supported. The orange zone – where suspected Covid-19 patients are admitted – also have all these facilities as several of the patients are actually testing positive,” said Dr NN Mathur, director of the hospital.At the centrally run All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), 100 beds – including 30 ICU beds – have been added in the newly constructed burns ward for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.“We are also planning to increase our bed strength at the Jhajjar centre by about 500 beds. This will also include ICU beds. In total, AIIMS currently has about 100 ICU beds for Covid-19 patients,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent , AIIMS.Another challenge the government faces is increasing the manpower at its hospitals, as well as the makeshift ones. For its own hospitals, the state government has decided to hire final-year MD/MS/ DNB (post-graduation medicine degree) students and final-year UG (undergraduate) and PG nursing students.Another administrator of a Delhi government Covid-19 hospital said, “We have been asked to recruit more staff, but it is not that easy. We do not get a lot of people for the walk-in interviews. So the medical and nursing student would be a great help. They can be trained for a few days and posted anywhere in the hospital.”For the makeshift hospitals in banquet halls and stadiums, the government has tied up with various doctors’ organisations in the city. “The government is in discussion with the doctors and it is likely to be finalised soon. They will have to take responsibility of running a section of the beds, providing manpower etc. As for consumables, the arrangement is being worked out,” said Dr Arun Gupta, the president of Delhi Medical Council who is also a member of the expert committee that gave the projections on the number of cases and beds required.All 40 hotels have been attached to private hospitals, which provide medical staff and consumables.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/efforts-on-to-boost-health-care-infrastructure-in-delhi-as-cases-surge/story-1eZ8fSpAuMHNRVePYoNRWO.html
21-06-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 treatments at private hospitals to get cheaper||The Delhi government said on Saturday that beds for Covid-19 patients at private hospitals will be subsidised, with treatment charges being reduced by 60-67%. The new rates, to be charged by all private hospitals with immediate effect, will be applicable to all Covid-19 beds at a private hospitals for up to 60% of its total capacity.“100% COVID beds shall be subsidised up to an upper limit of 60% of total hospital capacity,” Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Saturday after the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, cleared the move.The rates now have been capped between Rs 8,000 (non-NABH accredited hospitals) and Rs 10,000 (NABH accredited hospitals including entry level facilities) a day for an isolation bed, Rs 13,000-15,000 a day for a bed at an intensive care unit (ICU), and Rs 15,000-18,000 a day for an ICU bed with ventilator. Until this order was issued on Saturday evening, the fee for an isolation bed in Delhi was Rs 24,000-25,000 a day. For an ICU bed, it was Rs 34,000-43,000 a day, while an ICU bed with ventilator was Rs 44,000-54,000 a day.A senior government official said the cap of up to 60% of the total beds in private hospitals means that hospitals such as Moolchand, Fortis, etc., which have been declared as 100% Covid-19 hospitals will also have to offer the new subsidised rates to 60% of the beds. A second senior government official said that the health department is also going to issue an order making it mandatory for all private hospitals in Delhi to reserve 40% of their beds for Covid-19.The decision was taken at a meeting of DDMA on Saturday. Like the decision on the five-day mandatory institutional quarantine for all Covid-19 positive cases, this, too, was a point of disagreement between the L-G and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal during the DDMA meetings held on Saturday. Kejriwal is the vice-chairperson of the DDMA.The Covid treatment rates were recommended by an expert panel headed by NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul. “The rates approved by the committee would be applicable to all Covid beds up to the upper limit of 60% of the total bed capacity of the private hospitals. The L-G also directed that the hospitals would follow the National Guidelines on admission of COVID-19 patients… The L-G directed that best quality of clinical care should be provided to all patients. He advised that the health department should ensure adherence to quality of care by the hospitals/Laboratories as per standards. An efficient system for feedback and grievance redressal should be put in place by the Health Department to strictly ensure implementation of the recommendations of the High Level Expert Committee,” the LG office said in a statement.Representatives of private hospitals said they have been under stress to maintain staff and infrastructure in view of the increased demand for beds due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“While we fully support the need for transparency of pricing, hospitals are incurring considerably increased expenses on both non-Covid and Covid patient care. It is important to ensure there is no compromise in the quality of care or the safety of health care professionals,” Fortis hospital said in a statement.Another representative of a private hospital, asking not to be named, said: “The hospital now has to invest for at least double the staff. Earlier, if there were 200 nursing staff needed, now we need at least double that because they have to undergo quarantine after duty. Plus, when you ask someone to risk their lives they want a higher salary. How are the hospitals supposed to remain viable if the government imposes such price caps?”An order issued by the health department later on Saturday evening read that the rates recommended for private hospitals beds would be inclusive of all charges. The package rates will include bed, food, and other amenities, monitoring, nursing care, doctor’s visits/consultations, investigations including imaging, treatment as per national protocol for Covid care and standard care for co-morbidities, oxygen, blood transfusion and so on.“Since many of the Covid patients have conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular problems, etc, the charges for medical care of such co-morbidities will be a part of the package. This would include short-term haemodialysis as a part of acute care during the current admissions,” the order stated.The rates, the order stated, would not cover experimental therapies (ramdesivir, for example). “The charges will not include the cost of Covid-19 diagnostic test(s) as well as IL-6 levels. The proposed charges wil apply to paediatric patients as well. For pregnant women, cost for delivery (normal/c-section) and care of new born would be charged by the hospital extra as per prevailing PMJAY rates of relevant packages,” the order further read.The Delhi government in a statement said the Central government Committee had recommended the rates, but it was limited to 60% of the beds reserved for Covid patients in private hospitals.“As the Delhi government has asked private hospitals to reserve 40% of their beds for Covid patients as of now, this capping would have meant that only 24% of beds would have been price capped. CM Kejriwal put forward his views on this and strongly presented a case to price cap all the beds reserved for Covid in private hospitals. After deliberations, it was unanimously decided to price cap all the reserved beds for Covid patients which will benefit the common man and leave no scope for arbitrary overcharging,” the government said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-treatments-at-private-hospitals-to-get-cheaper/story-vVU5i0COD3OpIUrcM9xJEL.html
21-06-2020||Ranchi||Jharkhand moves SC against govt’s coal block auction move||The Jharkhand government has moved the Supreme Court challenging the central government’s decision to auction coal blocks for commercial mining, chief minister Hemant Soren said on Saturday. Soren said the state government has moved SC as it is a huge policy decision and the respective state governments needed to be taken into confidence. “Mining has always been a contentious issue in the state. ..This will take us back to the old system which we came out of. I think the Centre took this decision in a rush...There are several issues related to land and displacement in the state,” Soren said. “Several trade unions are out on the street against the decision,” he added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday launched the auction of 41 coal blocks under the new regime, under which the private miners would be sharing revenues with the government. The blocks are located in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/jharkhand-moves-sc-against-govt-s-coal-block-auction-move/story-rR85bbTQmrC4YYxPNzeEcM.html
21-06-2020||City||Covid-19 outbreak: Masks, sanitiser bottles part of wedding package in Mumbai||Going to a lockdown wedding? Be prepared to be greeted with a request to sanitise your hands at the entrance before you can check for your name on the invite list. Then, after getting a thermal scan done and changing your face mask, you can enter the mandap area (with your complimentary bottle of hand sanitiser) where guests are all seated with a few feet distance between them.Although the lockdown has forced the wedding market to shrink, caterers and wedding venues in the city are trying to adapt. The lockdown wedding package includes photography, food and decoration with artificial flowers, as well as masks, sanitisers, social distancing markers and thermal scanners. As per regulations, a wedding can have only 50 guests. Mumbai city collector Rajeev Nivatkar and Thane collector Rajesh Narvekar have said police clearance is required to ensure the venue is large enough for distancing norms to be observed.Hotel Tip-top Plaza in Thane recently released a video which shows how it follows all government regulations at its venues. Having opened up bookings, the venue will host two weddings this month. “We have created a package of ₹1.29 lakh, inclusive of masks and sanitiser bottles,” said an employee.Dombivili-based venue Shree Varad Siddhi Vinayak Seva Mandal has introduced wedding packages for ₹90,000 which include a sanitiser stand, thermal screening, face masks, a selfie-booth and sitting arrangements with adequate distancing. Umesh Naik of the seva mandal said, “Actually, we have a capacity for 1,000 people, so social distancing for 50 people is easily possible in the hall. We have a wedding the next month.” He added that some weddings from March and April that were cancelled are being held now.Another wedding planner in the city, SK Decorations, has created a ₹1.90-lakh package which includes e-invitations, hand-sanitisation station at the entrance and live streaming for those who can’t physically attend the wedding.However, some are finding adapting more difficult to cover overhead costs when the number of guests is small. Raja Iyer, owner of Mumbai-based Ronak Caterers, said his business had taken a hit with many families postponing weddings to the end of the year. “Only inviting 50 people is not possible for many families. We have not had inquiries since a few months now. But if we do, we are ready to provide sanitiser bottles and masks,” said Iyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-outbreak-masks-sanitiser-bottles-part-of-wedding-package-in-mumbai/story-ZG2rSeSsbBFTCL4pAIAXhJ.html

Also, I directed the civic body to emphasise on contact tracing and conduct mass screenings at homes,” Shinde said at Acharya Atre auditorium in Kalyan (West) during a review meeting of the preparations taken to tackle the outbreak in the city. The civic body plans to set up more quarantine centres and hospitals in the coming days.Shinde directed the civic body to finalise a location for these beds at the earliest and also appealed to the elected representatives to work as a team. City corporators also asked Shinde to impose a 15-day lockdown akin to Bhiwandi to reduce the number of cases in Thane. KDMC commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi said, “We are contemplating on the idea of a complete lockdown. The decision is yet to be made by the general body.”On Saturday, 243 new Covid cases were recorded in KDMC’s jurisdiction, taking the total count to 3,257. With two more deaths in the twin cities, the toll rose to 71. In neighbouring Thane, the case count crossed the 6,000-mark on Saturday, after 176 new cases took the total number of Covid-19 cases to 6,132. Thane recorded six new deaths, owing to which the toll now stands at 198. The city also recorded 51% recovery rate.“On Saturday alone, 114 people recovered and were discharged home,” a health officer from Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kalyan-dombivli-to-get-400-more-beds-for-covid-patients-says-guardian-minister/story-f9U7nVP459ScE8Zn4nwJkJ.html

Despite deliberations, the decision over the height of the idols at public pandals was deferred after some organisers demanded the state to allow the idols to be up to at least five feet instead of the three feet proposed by government. The organisers also assured that they will ensure social distancing norms at the pandals. The final decision over the height of the idols is expected to be taken by the state next week, after another meeting with representatives from the mandals. Every year, some public mandals even get idols which are more than 20-feet high.“We will decide over the height of the idol after the government announces the height limit. Our mandal has decided to cooperate with the government,” said Sudhir Salvi, secretary of Lalbaugcha Raja Ganeshotsav Mandal. He said the mandals also discussed several other issues pertaining to the festivities, which included considering last year’s permission as valid for setting up the pandals.Gajanan Tondvalkar, president of the Brihanmumbai Ganeshmurtikar Sangh, said, “All the sculptors are following the state government’s norms and are making idols of 21 inches [1.75 feet] in height for homes and up to three feet for public mandals. We also are making the idols from clay instead of the traditional plaster of Paris. We also expect the government to help us with permissions for our workshops, transportation and immersion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-decision-on-height-of-ganpati-idols-yet-mandals/story-jBnUpoMgd7KlIEtXGgdwaP.html
21-06-2020||Mumbai||More than 1,000 Covid-19 patients untraceable in Mumbai||As the number cases of Covid-19 rises to 65,329 in Mumbai, data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) shows that since the beginning of the lockdown, more than 1,000 Covid-positive cases in the city are untraceable. Tracking patients and their close contacts are critical to curbing the spread of Covid-19.“These patients aren’t dead or admitted to hospitals or Covid-19 care centres. We aren’t aware of their whereabouts. Ward-wise, we have around 1,000 such missing patients,” said a senior BMC official. Civic officials have also received complaints that ward officials hide discrepancies in the list of recovered patients. “Every day, we get an update from ward officials. Some Covid-positive patients haven’t been tracked for over 30 days,” said the official. BMC is already facing criticism for anomalies in fatality cases in Mumbai.Officials said many patients, fearing stigma, provide BMC with wrong addresses. Outstation patients often share phone numbers of their local guardian or contact. The issue of tracking patients becomes more challenging when the patients live in slums. According to BMC, of the missing patients, 60% are from slum pockets in the city. “It is extremely challenging to track patients in slums without accurate addresses. Even after taking help from locals, we can’t track all the patients,” said the official.Previously, BMC had constituted a group of teachers who were given the task of contacting family members of patients. This group found that most of the phone numbers they had were incorrect. Now the corporation has sought help from Mumbai Police to trace these cases and their contacts.“We are trying to pull out the correct address from Aadhaar or voter ID cards of patients through their names. This has helped us reach a large number of patients. We are also tracking their GPS coordinates to find their movement and location,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.Health activists emphasised the importance of giving correct information to the authorities. “Due to stigma, many patients provide wrong addresses. This exposes others around them to the infection, which further expands the chain of the virus,” said Dr Ravikant Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/more-than-1-000-covid-19-patients-untraceable-in-mumbai/story-1QEHwe1L7FM23bnM8xBLbK.html

The Kanwar Yatra is an annual pilgrimage that devotees of Lord Shiva undertake during the monsoon in the Hindu holy month of Shravan (July) to fetch the holy waters of the Ganga from Haridwar in Uttarakhand. Most of the pilgrims, called kanwarias, travel on foot. The pilgrims pass through several districts of western UP.Later, Yogi Adityanath had a video conference with ADG zones and divisional commissioners. The officers have been asked to hold a dialogue with religious gurus, kanwar yatra organisations and the peace committees on the issue.He said religious leaders should also be contacted to ensure that no assembly of more than five persons took place anywhere keeping in view the forthcoming festival of Eid Ul Azha (Bakrid).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/no-kanwar-yatra-this-year/story-ZI9GCUmYY9TvSXsIfVXZlM.html
21-06-2020||Mumbai||Carbon sequestration volume from Thane sanctuary valued at ₹46 lakh per year: Maharashtra government||The 896-hectare (ha) mangrove cover at Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary (TCFS) stores 2,688 tonnes of carbon every year, mostly from the pollutants released into the atmosphere, the Maharashtra forest department said. The estimated carbon sequestration volume was valued at ₹46 lakh per annum as an ecosystem resource, apart from being a safe haven for migratory birds and other species.Mangroves are salt-tolerant plants and so protect the coastline from inundation, capture and store carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. The process is called carbon sequestration, and it helps control rising global temperatures by reducing CO2 levels in the atmosphere, according to climate scientists.The forest department revealed the details in the revised management plan (2020-21 to 2029-30) for the sanctuary, which was approved by the state chief wildlife warden (CWLW) on Thursday. An estimated expenditure of ₹106.66 crore has been budgeted for the sanctuary’s protection over the next 10 years while developing a road map for threats and their mitigation measures. “The plan focuses on habitat improvement and identifies sustainable management options for natural and anthropogenic threats, which will help in the long-term protection of this crucial segment of the Central Asian Flyway,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra.The carbon sequestration study for TCFS was carried out by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, while preparing the management plan.“Even the loss of one mangrove tree can lead to excessive carbon being released back into the air, making it crucial to protect this complex ecosystem,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest, state mangrove cell.Tiwari explained that the WII study, using allometric equations of mangrove leaves, leaf litter and sediment biomass was based on the assessment that a 20-year-old mangrove plant has a carbon burial rate of 580 grams per square metre each year.“TCFS’s carbon sequestration potential was estimated to be around 3 tonnes per hectare every year is equivalent to ₹5,180 per ha each year, which when calculated for 896 ha becomes 2,988 tonnes per year and translates into an ecosystem resource of ₹46.6 lakh annually,” said Tiwari.The mangrove cell further validated these findings for two locations – Bhandup and Airoli – through another study where the quantum of carbon sequestered was calculated at 37.3 tonnes per ha from Avicennia marina species (most dominant in the creek).“Mangrove trees have more potential to store carbon than terrestrial trees. Declared sanctuaries create a permanent carbon stock providing continuous bionetwork services. This is essential to curb daily CO2 emissions for a city like Mumbai,” said Sheetal Pachpande, assistant director (projects), mangrove cell.In August 2016, the state declared the northern part of Thane creek – that includes a flamingo sanctuary spread over 1,690 ha (896 ha mangroves and 794 ha land adjacent to a water body) – as tourism zone to safeguard the flamingo population.The area is home to 12 true mangrove species and 39 mangrove associates, 167 species of birds, 45 fish species, 59 species of butterflies, 67 insect species.Independent experts said not just mangroves but the whole benthic habitat, including migratory birds and marine organisms, contribute to storing large quantities of carbon.“Any economic tag to the role played by TCFS is an underestimate as it is beyond human comprehension to understand its value as an ecosystem protecting the Mumbai region,” said Deepak Apte, director, Bombay Natural History Society.Meanwhile, a critical natural threat to TCFS was identified, as the increase in mangrove vegetation due to leaching (liquid byproduct when waste gets decomposed) and excess siltation, reducing the width of the creek and mudflats as roosting areas for flamingos. Environmentalists said declining creek width and mudflat loss could lead to a flooding threat.“If not monitored carefully the combination of issues could turn the sanctuary into a swamp,” said environmentalist Stalin D.Tiwari said the mangrove cell intends to demarcate the exact boundary of the creek on-ground. “To prevent the mudflat habitat from shrinking, we will be uprooting saplings during post monsoon months (October-December) to ensure the current mangrove line is not breached. We will also conduct regular mangrove mapping and health surverys,” he said.The management plan was first submitted by former mangrove cell chief N Vasudevan in January 2019. However, after modifications suggested by a committee under the CWLW related to patrolling pathways, watchtower construction, additional staff requirements, and sapling removal from mudflat, the plan was revised and resubmitted in May, and finally approved on Thursday.10-year budget to conserve flamingo sanctuaryAn estimated expenditure of ₹106.66 crore has been budgeted for the sanctuary’s protection over the next 10 years, while developing a road map for threats and their mitigation measures. Of this, ₹43.8 crore has been earmarked for tourism development, including the second phase of the Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Centre in Airoli (for developing amenities such as mangrove arboretum, parking facilities, mangrove trail, landscaping etc) as well as ‘Giant of the Seas’, a museum on marine animals comprising exhibits of whales and other marine species. ₹21 crore has been set aside for habitat management, site protection and restoration activities as well as for capacity building. The remaining funds would be used for increasing staff recruitment, building requirements, acquisition of vehicles and equipment for monitoring. State’s plans to combat anthropogenic threatsThe state plans to increase security staff, watchtowers, mangrove trails and increased tourism to put an end on hunting of flamingos.To prevent overfishing, the state will support fishermen through livelihood initiatives including aquaculture, crab culture and make them participate in tourism activities.The government will demarcate the exact boundary of the sanctuary on-ground. The management plan review committee plans to hold meetings every six months to check status of protection, and all proposed projects will be scrutinised at various levels of the state and Centre before assessing any clearances to prevent developmental pressures around the sanctuary.The state plans to keep a check on the dumping of waste and discharge of effluents by monitoring the pollution load from Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai. It also plans to treat water from the nearby cities.

21-06-2020||Chandigarh||55% new enrolments in Ludhiana govt school are from private schools||Unable to pay the exorbitant fees of private schools amid the lockdown-induced financial woes, more and more parents are looking to shift their wards to government schools.Education department records show that 55% of the new enrollments in the district’s government schools are of students shifting from private schools.Faced with layoffs, loss in businesses, parents drifting towards government schools that charge no fee for students upto Class 8. The fee for students of Classes 9 to 12 is also minimal.The private schools, on the other hand, are forcing parents to deposit three months’ tuition fee and pay other charges, unmindful of the financial constraints they may be facing. ONLINE CLASSES AND OTHER PERKSBesides, students and their parents also seem impressed by the online and televised classes started by the school education department.District education officer (secondary) Swaranjit Kaur, says, “Online classes through zoom app, recorded lectures on television and radio have also helped increase the enrolment in the government schools. Government schools are also providing free textbooks, uniform and better infrastructure to students, which is encouraging parents to consider shifting their wards here.”The school principals, meanwhile, have started making arrangements to accommodate the new students. Rajesh Kumar, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Basti Jodhewal, says, “Our school earlier had a 1,239 student. Now, our strength has increased to 1,590. I have written to the district education department to allow us to hold classes for primary sections in the morning shift and senior classes 9 to 12 in the afternoon shift once the school reopens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/55-new-enrolments-in-ludhiana-govt-school-are-from-private-schools/story-3npw4JhPgBIEgIY9oG5JUO.html
21-06-2020||Mumbai||Record 1-day jump in Maharashtra cases for third day in a row||For a third consecutive day, Maharashtra on Saturday recorded its highest 24-hour jump in coronavirus cases with 3,874 more infections, taking the tally to 128,205. Mumbai, the worst-affected Indian city, recorded its highest single-day spike in deaths with 136 fatalities, taking the toll to 3,561. The state’s Covid-19 death toll also rose by 160, pushing the fatality count to 5,984 . According to the state, barring Mumbai, Thane, Raigad and Palghar districts, reconciliation of deaths in all districts/municipal corporations has been done. India’s worst-affected city, Mumbai, reported 1,190 new cases. Of the deaths reported on Saturday, 10 were in Jalgaon and six in Aurangabad, besides 136 in Mumbai. The state’s recovery rate is 50.04% as 64,153 patients are reported to have recovered so far, with 1,380 patients discharged on Saturday. The case fatality rate in the state stands at 4.67%. State authorities, however, are wary about the rapid spread of the virus in some parts of the state, mainly because of the weak health infrastructure. Jalgaon and Solapur, where the cases have been rising rapidly in the past few weeks, the tracing and testing rate is poor. In Solapur, according to government officials, the local administration has failed to trace the vulnerable people among beedi and textile workers, whose immunity is low because of their work profiles. This has led to a high case fatality rate in the district. “We could contain the spread well in Mumbai, but the curve has been disturbed because of cases in other parts of the state. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has asked district collectors and civic chiefs to pull up their socks and contain the spread. The districts and municipal corporations are being monitored from state level,an official said. Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has again pointed at the lack of transparency. In a letter written to Thackeray, he has stated that the case fatality rate in Mumbai is 5.27% and the city’s total caseload is 52.18% of the total state cases. He has also pointed at lapses in the health system and at a few hospitals and demanded to maintain transparency. Mumbai’s case count, which was 61.37% on May 20, has dropped to 52.58% on Friday, while for Mumbai Metropolitan Region, it has come down to 73.85% on Friday from 76.40% on May 20. Mumbai accounted for 63.73% of the daily state cases on May 14, 56.47% on May 28, which dropped to 41.1% on June 17. Dr Sanjay Oak, who heads a task-force of doctors constituted by the government for the clinical management of critically ill patients, said that they are going to focus on reducing the fatality rate. “We are not scared of positive cases as they can be controlled. We have controlled them in Mumbai. Early identification, treatment and application of the appropriate drugs is the key for the treatment. After introducing plasma therapy, use of tocilizumab, now we are pushing for remdesivir and other drugs that have proved useful in treating Covid-19. We will focus completely on reducing the CFR in the state. The idea of the field hospitals has paid off well as we are ready with adequate beds and ready to take up more patients,” he said.He said that although the number of patients is on the rise, it is not a community spread of the disease and they now expect an undulating pattern of cases. “I would not say it as a peak, but there will be ups and downs in cases for the next few days, before the numbers start subsiding. One should understand that the virus would not completely go away, and the people have to be cautious while dealing with it,” Dr Oak said. After the first infection was reported on March 9, the month saw 302 cases and 10 deaths, followed by 10,196 cases and 449 deaths in April. In May, 57,157 cases and 1,827 deaths were reported, while 56,676 cases and 3,607 deaths were reported in 20 days of June. The cases in June account for 45.58% of the total.After a sudden jump of 1,328 fatalities, as a result of reconciliation of the data on Tuesday, the state case fatality rate has risen to 4.77%, much above the national rate. The state government, however, said that its recovery rate improved to 50.49% after 60,838 patients recovered. The state health department has also said that the doubling rate of cases has improved to 25.9 days on June 16, from 3.5 days on March 31 and 10.2 days on April 30 and 20.1 days on May 31. The weekly growth rate of cases has been 3% on June 16, from 12%, 7% and 4% on March 31, April 30 and May 31 respectively. Meanwhile, Thackeray inaugurated the 100th testing laboratory for coronavirus at GT Hospital in Mumbai on Saturday. This has augmented the total daily capacity to 38,000 samples, including 20,500 in private laboratories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/record-1-day-jump-in-maha-cases-for-third-day-in-a-row/story-nNA0yt9jG3UaFLmcCDH4aK.html

At the same time, their houses will be assessed to check whether they have adequate facilities for isolation such as two rooms and separate toilets, according to the modified home isolation guidelines in the national capital.After the initial assessment, if the team finds that the person has no co-morbidities and does not require hospitalisation, the patient can either continue to stay at the care centres, move to paid isolation facilities such as hotels, or opt to remain in home isolation, according to the order by Delhi’s principal health secretary, Vikram Dev Dutt, issued late Saturday night.This comes after the Delhi Disaster Management Authority reversed its order mandating five-day institutional isolation for every person who tested positive.Earlier, patients were to remain at home after testing positive and a team was sent to their homes to conduct the clinical assessment as well as assessment of their homes. Delhi started home isolation is April 30 and was one of the first states to adopt it.Currently, 12,611 people in home isolation in the city. There are 23,340 active cases or those still living with the infection, according to Delhi’s daily health bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/patients-health-conditions-to-be-assessed-at-covid-19-care-centres-before-home-isolation-in-delhi/story-t6GWuQgo9TfrzKYn1FdubJ.html

Earlier, from January 1 to March 22, the police had received a total of 867 complaints.”He added after the scrutiny of complaints, the complaints are marked to officers and police stations concerned.“Complainants are informed about the progress on their complaints within 24 hours through e-mail and text messages. Complainants receive updates on their complaints regularly,” said the DCP.“Most of the complaints the police are receiving on e-mail are regarding vehicle lifting, common frauds, land frauds and internet frauds, etc. In case of assault and other crimes, people call on the police,” he added.He said, “As most of city residents have access to internet on their phones, they are lodging complaints on the Facebook page of police and also on the Twitter handle of the district police.”To reduce crowding of police offices and stations, the police had requested people not to come to police offices and police stations, unless it is an emergency. The police had issued an email id cp.ldh.police@punjab.gov.in for people to lodge complaints.The police have also installed boxes at the reception of the CP office and asked people to drop their complaints in the boxes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/police-complaints-via-e-mail-rose-by-50-during-lockdown-in-ludhiana/story-tg4mbtlYSghtVc9UBTpRYK.html
21-06-2020||Chandigarh||Visa consultancy, IELTS centres in Chandigarh find no takers||With people putting off plans for travel and study abroad following the Covid-19 pandemic, visa consultancy firms and International English Language Testing System (IELTS) centres in Chandigarh are struggling to survive.With high commissions and international airlines yet to resume normal functioning there’s no one turning up at consultancies for travel and immigration advice. IELTS and Test of English as Foreign Language (TOEFL) centres which assess candidates’ proficiency in the language of the countries they are headed, too are facing a similar situation. According to a list of Chandigarh Police, there more than 200 immigration consultancies in the city. Finances hit, people not expected to travelAnuj Kalra, an immigration expert based in the city, says, “The economy may have reopened but embassies have deferred plans to reopen. International travel will remain critical even after the opening of embassies as people have been badly hit financially and many will not opt to travel abroad. We are not getting immigration related queries or phone calls yet. There has been no revenue since the lockdown was imposed.”Immigration experts say over one lakh students from Punjab and Chandigarh every year opt for popular education destinations such as the US, UK, Canada and Australia. For international travel firms, the period between April and September is considered peak season due to school and college vacations and favourable weather conditions, but this year business has been impacted.“Because of the high commissions remaining closed visa processes cannot be carried out at this stage. According to our calculations, we are not expecting any revenue till December,” says Jatin Wadhwa, director of an international education consultancy Survival a challengeA representative of Association of Overseas Education Consultants (AOEC) and CEO of Charms Education and Immigration, Manish Paitka, said, “There will be no real-time recruitment of students this year and no revenue will be generated. The industry is looking for the government’s support to prevent a total collapse.”Most of the 200 IELTS centres, which cater to not only Chandigarh, but also the adjacent states of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, have been impacted by the lockdown.Deshraj Thakral, who runs an IELTS centre, Y-Generation Overseas Education, in Sector 32, Chandigarh, says, “We have generated no revenues since the lockdown was imposed. We have started online classes but the response isn’t good. Students are postponing their plans to travel abroad. Layoffs could be a possibility If the situation does not improve till July.”Navneet Singh, an immigration consultant and AOEC representative said, “The business will take close to a year to get back to normal. Many students have not been able to write their final exams yet. It will take them a few more months to get ready to apply to an international university or college. So, we are hoping that situation gets better by January next year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/visa-consultancy-ielts-centres-in-chandigarh-find-no-takers/story-CVQRalsQqyQVGaIS9hQp5M.html

Manager of the Zara store, Deepak said, “We are seeing more customers now. Our sale is also on, so the footfall is increasing daily.”As per the protocol issued by the administration, visitors must install Aarogya Setu app and wear a face mask before entering the mall.

The administration recently told the Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) that disclosure of income and expenditure will not be an invasion of the privacy of the schools or violate their rights guaranteed under the Constitution.The administration, in response to plea filed by a private schools’ body challenging its order to upload the balance sheets, argued that the institutes were public entities as these had been built on government land and were bound to follow the administration’s directions.The Independent Schools’ Association has also challenged constitution of the Fee Regulatory Authority under the Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institutions Act, adopted by UT in 2018.The administration had reasoned that the law was adopted with some amendments to ensure transparency and accountability, which was essential for fee regulation.Schools were asked to upload balance sheets in consonance with provisions of the law and upon complaints of profiteering and some parents seeking fee waiver in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak.Many schools did not upload balance sheets and did not respond to the show-cause notice served to them for failing to comply with the order, the administration said.Demanding that petition be dismissed they asked the court to tell the schools to approach the competent authority in the administration with their grievance, if any.

He suspected her of infidelity, police said.The victim has been identified as Naju Khatoon, 38, while the accused is Mohammad Mehfooz , 40, a labourer of Jodhewal area. His friend, Mohammad Rafeeq, is on the run.The incident came to light when the victim’s children revealed the incident to their maternal grandfather, who lives in Bihar.Mohammad Daud, the victim’s father, said that the couple had strained relations. A few days ago, he got a call from the accused, informing him that Naju had died. He was also told that the burial had been completed.“When I asked him why he did not wait for the family members to reach Ludhiana, Mehfooz could not give a satisfactory reply. Thereafter I came to Ludhiana to find out on my own. After much coaxing, my grandchildren, aged 11 and 9, told me their father had killed their mother and they had been threatened against revealing the incident to anyone,” Daud said.The Ludhiana police have sought the district magistrate’s permission to exhume the body for post-mortem.Additional deputy commissioner of police-1 Deepak Pareek said that Mehfooz used to suspect that his wife had illicit relations with other men so he hatched a conspiracy to kill her and also involved Mohammad Rafeeq in the crime. In wee hours of June 14, the duo strangled Naju to death when the children were sleeping at home. However, the children came to know about the incident.”The ADCP added that the police have arrested Mahefooz while his accomplice is absconding.Sub inspector Arshpreet Kaur Grewal, Basti Jodhewal station house officer, said that Mehfooz had promised to pay Rs 30,000 to Rafeeq for helping him in the murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-labourer-strangulates-wife-buries-body-caught/story-1Gn5DEJXGEVAk4kw33ZzdJ.html

21-06-2020||Mumbai||Coming up: New containment plan for Mumbai||With the growth rate of Covid-19 cases rising in the city’s suburbs, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to revise its strategies regarding containment and tracing, to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. In the case of redeveloped high-rises under the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), the civic body has decided to revert to sealing entire buildings instead of the single floor on which a resident may have tested positive for Covid-19. This, civic officials explained, is because of the high density in SRA buildings as compared to other high-rises. Starting Sunday, BMC will also conduct door-to-door surveys in high-rises of north Mumbai to detect symptomatic patients, as officials believe that contact tracing has not been foolproof. BMC will also restrict the movement of those residing in containment zones and sealed buildings by sealing buffer zones. “We had a meeting with the Mumbai Police on Friday, after which we have taken several decisions to control the increasing cases. These include door-to-door surveys in high-rises to find new cases and sealing the entire building instead of only the floor in SRA buildings where residents test positive. We have also decided to extend the lockdown in all market areas and buffer zones if large crowds are observed in these places,” said Vishwas Shankarwar, deputy municipal commissioner of zone 7. Meanwhile, 1,190 new cases were recorded on Saturday, taking the city’s case count to 65,329. Mumbai reported its highest single-day death count of 136, taking the overall toll to 3,561 deaths. The total number of discharged patients was 32,867, with a recovery rate of 50%. Active cases in the city stood at 28,893. The fatality rate in the city as of Saturday was 5.45%, and the doubling rate has reached 34 days.The change in strategy comes as the city prepares to reach the 80,000-case mark by June-end if the current pace of growth continues. BMC’s focus will now be on five wards in the suburbs, covering areas of Dahisar, Borivli, Kandivli, Malad, Mulund, Vikhroli, Kanjurmarg, etc. The daily growth rate in the above-mentioned areas is between 3-4.5% against the average daily growth rate of 2.05% in the city. H East ward, which covers Bandra (East) and Santacruz, has the lowest growth rate in the city (1%), followed by E ward (Byculla, Mazagaon, Mumbai Central) and FN ward (Wadala, Dadar, Matunga, and Sion), both having a growth rate of 1.1%.In both R North ward (Dahisar and parts of Borivli) and PN ward covering Malad, BMC has widened the scope of containment areas by clubbing the buffer zone in the containment zone.“We have decreased the number of containment zones but clubbed the buffer zones in them. The concentration is majorly in slums when it comes to Dahisar (East), high-rises in Dahisar (West), and parts of Borivli. We are restricting the movement of those in containment zones to ensure the cases come down. Currently, there are many hidden cases and we are expecting to bring the number under control in the coming days due to better detection of these hidden cases,” said Sandhya Nandekar, assistant municipal commissioner, R North ward.In R Central ward covering Borivli, BMC claims 70% of the cases are in high-rises, owing to which their focus is to ensure minimal movement of those residing in sealed buildings. Around 60% of Malad, which has major slum areas, has been declared as a containment zone and is under lockdown, where only essential shops can remain open.Bhagyashree Kapse, assistant municipal commissioner of R Central ward, said, “Police had said that we should have a complete lockdown owing to rise in cases but that is not feasible. In my ward, 70% of the cases are in high-rises, and only 30% are from slums that are declared as containment zones. We are releasing those areas where no cases were reported for the last 20 days.”Meanwhile, Dharavi, one of the critical hotspots in Mumbai, reported its lowest number of cases since the first week of April. On Saturday, only seven cases were recorded, taking the total case count of the area to 2,158 with 80 deaths so far. A makeshift 1,000-bed Covid-19 hospital has been set up in the premises of engineering company Richardson and Cruddas in Byculla, according to BMC.In a statement on Saturday, the civic body informed that of the 1,000 beds, 300 are ICU beds with oxygen supply and other facilities. The hospital will be ready to use by the end of June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coming-up-new-containment-plan-for-mumbai/story-pqmKNo8LP37dyqUZw8YFRN.html

21-06-2020||Mumbai||State unveils academic planner to help students learn||To ensure students do not miss out on learning as schools remain shut across the state, the Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training (MSCERT) has come up with an academic planner.The 270-page document consists lesson plans for all subjects for Classes 1 to 10 under the state board curriculum. It lists out chapters to be completed every week between June and September. It will act as a guideline for teachers and parents to help the students learn remotely. “We had already started sending out links to students on a daily basis when the lockdown was announced in March. These links consisted audio-visual content on DIKSHA app, which students could access on their phones. Now, with this planner, we hope that teachers find it easy to teach children remotely even if not all of them have access to live online classes,” said Dinkar Patil, director, MSCERT. The planner also includes embedded links for each module, which parents or students can click on to see audio-visual content on the module. “It has to be circulated to all parents but care needs to be taken that teachers also supplement it with proper instruction and guidance to students with the help of phone, video call or messages,” states the planner. Over the next two weeks, schools across the state will distribute textbooks to students in a phased manner. “We are hoping that once textbooks reach students, learning can begin, especially for those who do not have internet or smartphone. Our teachers can call students and ask them to read and understand one thing at a time with the help of the planner,” said the principal of a suburban school. Schools in the state have started their new academic year from June 15 and have been asked to start online learning for students until physical reopening of schools is permitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-unveils-academic-planner-to-help-students-learn/story-BimbLsB7AQZJj27tfEtRrM.html

21-06-2020||Chandigarh||THE FINAL BLOW: Brass band groups in Ludhiana struggle to stay afloat as weddings become a low-key affair||Once an indispensible part of weddings, the brass band groups in city are struggling to make ends meet as the Covid-19 outbreak and the resultant social distancing norms have put a halt on grand-scale celebrations.Band owners say they have not got any bookings in the past three months as couples are either deferring their weddings or going for small, intimate affairs in view of the lockdown.“We got 50 wedding cancellations in the first month of the lockdown itself. And since there is a ban on religious processions too, we have been sitting idle ever since the lockdown was imposed,” says Sham Singh Anand, the owner of Shehanshah Band. Harpreet Mann, the owner of Sartaj Band and Milan Band, says, “Due to the cap on gatherings, most people are giving bands a skip. The government has allowed only 50 persons to participate in wedding events but the band groups itself comprise of five to 40 crew members.”Mann says the government should either increase the cap on gatherings or provide monetary relief to bands till the situation improves.CREW MEMBERS FORCED TO LOOK FOR ODD JOBSMeanwhile, the crew members of these bands are forced to look for alternate job options.Vinod Kumar, a dhol player with the Sartaj Band, says, “As there are no wedding functions or religious events, I have been forced to sell vegetables to make a living. I have three children but due to financial crunch, I was unable to get them admitted to school this year.”Satish Kumar, another member of the band, says, “I have been working with the band for 15 years. But now, I am working as an autorickshaw driver to earn a livelihood. After paying the auto’s rent, I am left with a meager amount which is often not enough to meet the day-to-day expenses.”‘GOVT SHOULD PROVIDE RELIEF’Harwinder Jolly, president of the Ludhiana brass band association, says, “We have been in this business for over 25 years but have never witnessed anything like this. There are around 70 band groups in Ludhiana and everyone is struggling to stay afloat. We appeal to the government to announce some relief for the sector.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/the-final-blow-brass-band-groups-in-ludhiana-struggle-to-stay-afloat-as-weddings-become-a-low-key-affair/story-XXJgeEfWrQq7qbMiFIuDPO.html

21-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s RWAs relieved after revision of mandatory quarantine order||Residents across the national capital on Saturday said they were “relieved” that an order mandating five days of institutional quarantine for all Covid-19 patients was rolled back. Many citizens groups said quarantining all Covid-19 patients, even those with mild symptoms, would discourage people from getting tested for the infectious disease.Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal in his capacity as head of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had on Friday issued an order making five days of institutional quarantine compulsory for all Covid-19 patients, irrespective of their symptoms — a move the Delhi government said was “arbitrary” and “harmful” for the city.However, Baijal on Saturday evening tweeted, “Regarding institutional isolation, only those COVID positive cases which do not require hospitalisation on clinical assessment and do not have adequate facilities for home isolation would be required to undergo institutional isolation.”As of Saturday, the national capital has recorded 56,746 Covid-19 cases, of whom 2,112 have died. On Saturday, at least 50 resident welfare associations (RWA) in the city wrote to the L-G, asking him reconsider the order, and mandating institutional quarantine for only without adequate space for isolation at home.Dr Ruby Makhija, secretary, Navjeevan Vihar RWA, Malviya Nagar, welcomed the move and said it was a matter of reassurance for people.“Local authorities can rope in RWAs to help patients under home isolation. For instance, they can follow up on their health and make essentials available to them,” said Makhija, an ophthalmologist, whose RWA, along with 49 others, wrote to the L-G.Later on Saturday, once the order was revoked, the 50 RWAs wrote another letter to the L-G, this time lauding the decision, and adding that “associations look forward to being consulted in such matters”.These included the RWAs of Greater Kailash 1, Anand Lok, Vasant Vihar, Sarvodya Enclave, Mandakini Enclave, Geetanjali Enclave, Mayur Vihar, Ashok Vihar and east Delhi’s Federation of RWAs, among others.Suresh Goel (61) a resident of Vasant Vihar, said it was sensible to have withdrawn the order. “There are many who need their family’s support to recover. The government must focus on providing beds to those in need of hospital care, which has been an issue so far,” he said.Members of United Residents Joint Action (URJA), an umbrella body of 2,500 RWAs in the city, said it was a timely move to revoke the order, but added that it should not have been issued in the first place.“Issuing such orders creates confusion and panic among people, who are already battling so many odds. There should be proper consultations before passing such an order that can majorly impact the populace,” said Atul Goyal, president, URJA.Rejimon CK, a member of Dwarka Forum, said a number of associations in the area had arranged for medical equipment such as oxygen concentrators and cylinders, as emergency aid for people under home isolation. “The government must ensure that in the event a patient’s condition deteriorates, people should be able to avail an ambulance and find a bed in a facility where they are attended to properly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rwas-relieved-after-revision-of-mandatory-quarantine-order/story-pydLkpQKfvYxhAgJvYdkWN.html
21-06-2020||Delhi||Scramble for beds, ambulances, confusion before order reversed||By Saturday evening when Delhi L-G Anil Baijal revised his Friday’s order to put all Covid-19 patients who were under home isolation in institutional quarantine, officials in many districts had already put many in the quarantine centres while others were scrambling to arrange beds and ambulances needed for such patients. On Saturday evening, the L-G issued a fresh order saying only those needing hospitalisation and not having adequate facilities for home isolation would have to undergo institutional quarantine.Officials in at least three districts -- South, Southwest and West -- confirmed to HT sending patients in home isolation to quarantine centres since Friday evening. In the Southwest district, there were even cases where asymptomatic persons who tested positive for Covid refused to get into an ambulance and threatened to take legal recourse, a senior official in the district said on condition of anonymity. Throughout the day, several Covid-19 patients currently under home isolation were moved to Covid care centres even as the government was engaged in a dialogue with the L-G for overturning the decision of five-day mandatory home isolation. “Several ambulances had been kept ready for moving patients from home isolation to the centres. We were getting calls from the district authorities about the transfer. But, the problem was that many of the centres were refusing to admit the patients. Some of the ambulance were on call for two to three hours waiting with the patient at the centres to see whether they would be admitted,” said a CATS (Centralised Accident and Trauma Services) Ambulance employee on condition of anonymity.For most part of the day, officers were also confused whether the order was also applicable on the 10,490 Covid patients who were in home quarantine till Friday. Later, principal secretary (health and family welfare) Vikram Dev Dutt clarified to all officers that people in home isolation till June 19 were not supposed to be sent to the quarantine centres unless anyone was found violating the ICMR guidelines.At the same time districts such as Shahdara and East chose to wait until there is more clarity on the matter. District magistrates, who are responsible to arrange such facilities and requisition them accordingly, said had the L-G’s order not been withdrawn they would have had no option but to compromise on the quality and safety parameters.“If we actually had to continue keeping everyone under institutional isolation, we would have had to take over all stadiums and even the smallest dharamshalas apart from the banquet halls and hotels, some of which are paid facilities. The middle and upper middle class residents already complained to us after the order as to why they are being subjected to opt for paid and substandard facilities when they can get cured in their homes,” said an official in the South district.In Shahdara, the quarantine facility running in the Mandoli police quarters had gloomy state of affairs. In some flats, the beds were laid out on the floor while only a few had cots. The toilets in these flats were dirty and unkempt. There was no hot drinking water facility, a basic requirement for Covid patients.Officials in the Shahdara district also said they reached out to the Northern Railways on Saturday after the L-G’s order to ready the railway coaches at Anand Vihar. When it comes to toilets, the ratio was even worse in some of the banquet halls, 77 of which have been identified to create over 11,000 beds. HT visited three banquet halls ---- two in Karol Bagh and one opposite Lok Nayak hospital and saw there were two toilets for 50 persons and no bathrooms. Some had three. Besides, there were no charging points or tables or chairs available with the beds to charge phones or keep essential items.When asked about these problems a government spokesperson said facilities in banquet halls and hotels are still being readied and that the issues highlighted will be addressed. With monsoon expected by next week, at least four DMs HT spoke to on Saturday said mosquitoes were turning out to be major issue in their respective centres. Some said they were ordering mosquito nets while others were procuring coils.“We are placing orders for mosquito nets. With monsoon coming the problem is going to get even bigger. Already we have started getting a lot of complaints,” said an official who manages the quarantine centres set up in government flats in Narela. Heat is another major problem which these centres are battling with. While coolers are being arranged at some places, some authorities are also resorting to trying different initiatives to finding solutions to the problems.In South Delhi’s Radha Saomi Satsan Beas facility which is touted to be the country’s biggest CCC with a capacity of 10,000 beds, the workers of the religious institute were found applying mud packs on the floors to keep the shed cool.To bring down the temperatures inside the train coaches, railway officials said they are considering using “bubble sheets” on the roof of the coaches which could bring down temperatures “by three-four degrees.”One aspect which all officials agreed would not be a problem is food. “We have done it during the lockdown. Food was being prepared in a decentralized manner for around 12 lakh people every day. So that is one thing which is doable,” an official, who did not wish to be named, said.For the districts which on Saturday actually began to take away Covid positive persons in their government-run quarantine facilities, also known as Covid care centres (CCCs), the respective administrations said at the city’s current positivity rate, the available beds would last only for about five days.In Delhi, the average rate of samples testing positive for Covid-19, has grown from 7% on May 17 to over 31% on June 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mad-scramble-for-beds-ambulances-confusion-before-l-g-s-order-was-revised/story-flmWdJBE9Qii8wDgzhv48O.html
21-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi directs its hospitals to recall all staffers from leave||The Delhi government’s health department has directed all hospitals and medical institutions under it to recall all their employees on leave and ask them to report for duty immediately. The special secretary of the health department SM Ali issued the order on Friday. A senior health department official has said that leave of any kind would only be granted under the “most compelling circumstances.”“…Issue directions to all staff who are on leave of any kind to immediately report for their duties in their concerned hospital or medical institution without fail,” the order read. The medical directors of bigger Delhi government hospitals reported the shortage of staff as one of the chief reasons for their inability to expand intensive care unit services for Covid patients. “We have asked everyone on leave to join back duty immediately and cancelled all leaves. With the rising number of Covid-19 cases, we will need more staff in the coming days,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak hospital.To combat the challenges in the hospitals, the government on Thursday ordered that the final-year student pursuing their MD/MS/ DNB (post-graduate medical training) and final-year students of undergraduate and post-graduate nursing will be hired for the next six months.“The students will help the doctors in various areas of the hospital. This will free up doctors for ICUs and other critical patients,” said Dr Kumar.Earlier this week, the health department had also issued another order that stated that action would be taken against health department staff not reporting to work. Only those who had tested positive for Covid-19 were allowed to remain in home isolation. This came at a time when the city’s health minister tested positive for the infection. Prior to this order, the director general of health services also had to undergo quarantine for feverAs of Saturday, the national capital has recorded 56,746 Covid-19 cases, of whom 2,112 have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-directs-hospitals-to-recall-all-staff-on-leave/story-tqAP0bRnAtIEduXJwekwiI.html
21-06-2020||Delhi||Health minister Satyendar Jain’s condition improves after plasma therapy||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain’s condition has improved after receiving plasma therapy for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Friday night at Max hospital, Saket. The minister’s fever has subsided and he is off oxygen support, according to hospital sources. He is currently stable and is being monitored by a team of critical care specialists in the hospital’s intensive care unit, according to sources.Convalescent plasma therapy uses a component of the blood called plasma, which is rich in virus-fighting antibodies, from someone who has recovered from the infection, to boost an infected person’s immunity.The therapy is currently provided only under a multi-centric a clinical trial that is being spearheaded by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). In Delhi, seven hospitals are enrolled for the trial, including Max Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College and Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.Jain, 55, had tested positive for the infection on Wednesday, after testing negative a day before that. He had been admitted to the Delhi-government-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital in Tahirpur on Monday night with a high-grade fever and low oxygen saturation. He had attended an all-party meeting held by the Union home minister Amit Shah the same day.At the hospital, he had been on intermittent oxygen to manage the symptoms. He had developed pneumonia, a known complication of Covid-19. The minister, who has no comorbidities, started getting breathless and giddy on Friday morning.The infection usually causes severe symptoms in older people and those with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, kidney or heart disease. His CT scan on Friday afternoon showed that the pneumonia patch in his lungs had increased. He was moved to the intensive care unit of the hospital in the morning.As his symptoms worsened, the minister was shifted to Max hospital, Saket. Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday had tweeted, “Praying for the speedy recovery of Shri Satyendra Jain, Health Minister of Delhi who is battling with COVID-19 infection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/health-minister-satyendar-jain-s-condition-improves-after-plasma-therapy/story-vbJmq9Hvl8WP7jShxOEGjL.html
21-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt plans to augment its ambulance fleet to up to 1,000||New Delhi: With the number of cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) rising in the city, the Delhi government plans to expand its ambulance fleet to 1,000 by June-end to meet the increasing demand. To augment the fleet, the government has also requested the police to provide 100 PCR vehicles to be used as ambulance. Four other companies have been asked to provide more ambulances to help the government reach the fleet strength of 1,000.In its communication to the companies and the police, the government has said, “Due to increasing number of calls in view of Covid-19, the fleet of ambulance is required to be augmented to up to 1,000 by June 30. Department of Health and Family Welfare is striving to arrange for this additional requirement of ambulances at the earliest.”Currently, the state government through its Centralised Accident and Trauma Services (CATS) runs about 200 ambulances. Another 170 ambulances have been added through contracts with private ambulance companies and the Army.Of these, 163 are currently on ‘Corona duty’ ferrying patients from home to hospital, transfer between hospitals, and take people who don’t have personal vehicles to testing centres.As per data provided by the government in the daily health bulletin, there were 243 request calls for Covid-19 ambulances.“The requirement for ambulances has dipped a little after the lockdown. This is because now most people can use their own vehicles to take patients to hospitals. However, the requirement is likely to pick up with the number of Covid-19 patients increasing and several needing hospitalisations,” said a health department official, on condition of anonymity.So far, Delhi has 53,116 cases of Covid-19 and 2,035 people have died of it.The government anticipates that the number of cases is likely to touch 1 lakh by the end of the month and 5.5 lakh by the end of July. To prepare for the surge, the government is planning to create makeshift hospitals in hotels, banquet halls, and stadiums.Not only is the government working on increasing the number of ambulances, they are also working to increase the phone lines for the services. It has contacted WIPRO, the company that helped the government set up the modern control room in Laxmi Nagar to increase the number of telephone line to 60 from the current 30, “to minimise the call-waiting time for a citizen in need of ambulance services.”People can call for an ambulance on the number ‘102’ or on 7291000071, 7291000078, 7291000093 and 7291000094.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-plans-to-augment-its-ambulance-fleet-to-up-to-1-000/story-vPH2HmOXswWAMLhSVN8JSL.html
21-06-2020||Gurugram||State forms task force to study Covid-19 deaths without co-morbidities||With nearly 66% of the Covid-19 deaths from Haryana were due to co-morbidities that the patients suffered from, doctors from PGIMS, Rohtak will partner with those from AIIMS, New Delhi to set up a task force to study the cause of death in the rest. Researchers across the world have reported that patients with co-morbidity conditions like hypertension, diabetes, cancer or any respiratory illness are at a significantly higher risk of being critically ill once they contract the coronavirus disease. The rest, given their age and immunity, have a good chance to make a full recovery.On Saturday, Haryana reported 10,223 cases (480 fresh cases) and 149 deaths (5 new deaths), resulting in a mortality rate of 1.45%. At 4,307 (171 new) Gurugram has 37% of the total case load in the state, and 59 deaths.“Two-thirds of the deaths we have seen are of patients who suffer from some form of comorbidity,” said Dr. Dhruv Chaudhary of PGIMS Rohtak, who is also the nodal officer for Covid-19 tertiary care (for critical cases) in the state. “One way to cut down deaths is to reduce the number of those moderate cases from becoming critical.”Although they are still trying to figure out the medical reasons where patients without any co-morbidities are succumbing to the disease, Dr. Chaudhary points to two possible reasons.“Time is wasted, after the onset of symptoms, on figuring out where to admit them after they test positive -- people run between government and private hospitals. In this process, a patient with moderate symptoms turns into a critical care patient,” said Dr. Chaudhary “Second, a patient with moderate symptom is scared of institutional quarantine and are avoiding it. Majority of the positive patients are struggling to understand the disease. We are trying to address these issues that can help in controlling the rising death numbers.” “Our team is collecting reports prepared by Covid-19 death audit committees in different districts. What we are seeing as a critical issue is the poor continuity of medical care in some of the cases,” he added.The reports prepared by the death audit committee shows that people who have succumbed to the disease were admitted directly to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Most of them died within a day or two after suffering a heart attack or kidney failure, especially those who had no co-morbidity issues.“A task force has been set up who are coordinating with the doctors in AIIMS to study the cause of deaths in such cases,” said a senior state official, privy to matter. Dr Chaudhury confirmed this to HT.Currently, at least 80 patients in Gurugram are under critical care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/state-forms-task-force-to-study-covid-19-deaths-without-co-morbidities/story-yvQqLxCTGk6jv2KRa6TJ4H.html
21-06-2020||Gurugram||Insurance may not be enough to cover Covid treatment: Data||A medical insurance policy may not be enough to cover the costs of Covid-19 treatment at a private facility in the district, suggests industry data compiled by the General Council of Insurance (GIC). The data shows that patients in Gurugram have been spending an average amount close to half their treatment costs out-of-pocket, per claim. Industry insiders and employees of private hospitals attributed this discrepancy to the cost of ‘overhead consumables’, such as PPE kits, which aren’t liable to be covered under existing health policies. They also spoke of increased operating costs being borne by private hospitals which are, in turn, driving up the cost of treatment—resulting in a tussle between insurers and hospitals, but ultimately impacting patients.Manish, who wished to be identified only by his first name, and whose parents were both admitted to a corporate hospital in Sector 29, received two bills for their treatment. “For my mother, I was charged about ₹1.5 lakh for a week of stay. She did not require any intensive care, just isolation, and insurance covered almost 90% of the bill. But my father has been on the ventilator and received plasma therapy. His bill is more than three times the amount. My insurer is not willing to cover more than 60% of the bill.” A private insurer said that they are not receiving substantially high claims for the treatment of mild or asymptomatic cases. “But when it comes patients who have been in the ICU, for example, the bills can be as much as ₹7 lakh-₹8 lakh. The number of patients requiring intensive care in Gurugram has not been as high as in Delhi, going by the claim amounts we are receiving.”Even so, data shows that there is a large discrepancy between what insurers are willing to pay, and what patients are having to spend out-of-pocket. A total of 459 insurance claims were made in the district up to June 17, to the tune of ₹8.8 crore. While 266 of these claims have been settled, the amounts disbursed by insurance companies is less than half—about ₹3.1 crore. The average claim size—or the amount claimed for treatment by a single patient—comes to ₹1.93 lakh in Gurugram (based on data for 459 claims filed with private insurers up to June 17). The average settlement size is ₹1.15 lakh, indicating that patients in Gurugram are paying an average cost of ₹78,000 out-of-pocket per claim. “Our liabilities include the cost of the beds, medicines, and so on, but don’t include items not used in the direct treatment of the patient. PPE kits, for example, are used by a healthcare worker. The cost should be borne by hospitals, and most insurers will be opposed to footing it,” said an underwriting officer at a leading national insurance company, which has processed over 100 insurance claims in Gurugram. The employee of another private sector insurer, on condition of anonymity, said, “Consumables form a major portion of surgical cases amounting to almost 10% of the total bill. But for Covid-19 cases, even mild ones, they constitute a much a larger share, sometimes as much as 50%, depending on the hospital.” The employee added that insurers typically have a cap on bed rents and ICUs, the cost for which has been driven up due to increased demand. “A typical Arogya Sanjeevani health product caps the room rent payable by the insurer at ₹5,000 per day, but in Gurugram and Delhi, room rents at some hospitals are exceeding ₹20,000 a day,” the employee added.Data shows that across Haryana, too, patients are paying close to half of their treatment costs out-of-pocket. Of 384 claims for Covid-19 treatment (till June 9), Haryana’s total claim size was ₹5.99 crore. The average amount settled (up to June 9), however, comes to ₹2.23 crore (about 37% of the amount claimed). Haryana’s average claim size amounts to ₹1.56 lakh, while the average amount settled comes to ₹84,000, indicating an out-of-pocket expenditure (borne by the patient) of ₹72,000 per claim. A senior physician dealing directly with Covid-19 patients at a prominent corporate hospital in Palam Vihar explained that private hospitals across India have had to invest heavily in logistical changes to keep patients and employees safe from Covid-19. “We are putting up health care workers in alternate accommodations, reserving separate dialysis machines for patients, setting up negative pressure isolation rooms, spending on PPEs, increasing the health cover provided to doctors and nurses, and so on. Operating costs are up by at least 20%, so naturally, treatment costs are up, too,” the doctor said. Experts, on the other hand, criticised this response and stressed on the need to not just cap prices, but also more transparent billing. “Figures compiled by GIC show that Covid-19 treatment is prohibitive even for persons who are covered by insurance, because of huge out-of-pocket expenditures. In general, hospitals are levying higher charges on patients due to increased operating costs, but this is disingenuous because costs for PPE and biomedical waste disposal were anyway being offloaded on to patients,” Malini Aisola, co-convenor at the All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN), said.Aisola added that this practice of straddling patients with additional expenses amid a pandemic requires official intervention as is being done in several states—through fixing Covid-19 treatment charges based on cost analysis. Moreover, while the IRDAI has instructed general and standalone insurers to redraft their policies (to include consumables) by September 30, Aisola said this date may be too far down the line to help patients in need of immediate relief.VS Kundu, the nodal officer for Covid-19 monitoring in Gurugram, said, “We have instated a committee to specifically address the high cost of treatment at private hospitals. Their report should be out in a day or two. That should provide some clarity to all stakeholders, whether hospitals, patients, or insurers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/insurance-may-not-be-enough-to-cover-covid-treatment-data/story-SBf1f8awIALsTOteo24mjP.html
21-06-2020||Gurugram||Nine ‘most-wanted’ ATM lifters, including former Delhi cop, arrested||The Nuh police team arrested nine “most wanted” men, including a suspended Delhi Police assistant sub-inspector, on Thursday and Friday in connection with investigations into over 300 ATM thefts across the country.Police identified the Delhi Police officer as 50-year-old Aslup Khan who had gone missing in 2016 and was allegedly involved in over 100 such cases in Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Police claim Khan was the mastermind of the spate of thefts.The other suspects were identified by their first names as (all between 25 to 52 years of age) Shaukat, Shahid, Farukh, Shahjid Shorab, Jamshed alias Pittal, Shahid alias Polo, Sher alias Sadar and Sadruddin of Sikharpur village. All were carrying reward of ₹50,000 on their arrest, said police adding that they have recovered uprooted ATM kiosks and ₹10 lakh from them.Narender Bijarnia, superintendent of police (SP), Nuh, said they had received a tip about Aslup Khan and raided his villages Shikarpur on Thursday and thereafter raided Nagina and Punhana villages on Friday from where they caught the other eight.“Khan in December 2016 had gone on leave but never returned. He was suspended and his salary withheld. Later, his involvement was discovered in a few ATM thefts. Our investigation revealed he had formed a gang of more than 20 people who were actively involved in thefts and carjacking,” he said.During interrogation, he allegedly told the police about their involvement in over 300 ATM thefts across eight states. “He stole more than ₹15 crore in the last four years and revealed the modus operandi of his gang,” said Bijarnia.Khan and his associates used to travel in flights to different states to conduct reconnaissance of targets before uprooting the ATM kiosks. Police said special police teams from Kerala, Delhi, and Haryana were formed to arrest Khan but he managed to evade them each time.“There are more than 100 gangs operating from Nuh who are actively involved in uprooting ATMs. We have formed teams and are targeting all the proclaimed offenders and have started operation clean up in the district,” said the SP.After much resistance from residents, the team managed to apprehend suspects while they were resting at their respective homes after allegedly returning from their operations of uprooting ATMs from Uttar Pradesh during lockdown in the last three days.Delhi Police spokesperson Mandeep Singh Randhawa said, “We have not been informed about any such arrest. The information will be verified as and when it comes and further action would be taken accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/nine-most-wanted-atm-lifters-including-former-delhi-cop-arrested/story-Mk8qjogFPOnynZsdxZjI4N.html
21-06-2020||Noida||Noida extends date for rescheduling of land dues for developers||In the wake of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the Noida authority on Saturday said it has extended the date to reschedule pending land dues owed to the authority till September 30. The authority’s finance controller, Sudhir Singh, has issued an order asking developers to take benefit of this opportunity to reschedule their outstanding amount as per rules and start paying pending dues. According to the earlier order issued on February 19 this year, developers were asked to get their dues rescheduled by the end of April. But they could not do so due to the national lockdown.“Therefore, we have now extended the date to September-end for developers and other allottees such as industrial and institutional plot owners,” said Singh.The authority had allotted housing land to developers after accepting 10% down payment of the land cost, and the builders were supposed to pay remaining 90% cost in instalments. But due to slowdown in the real estate sector, several builders failed to pay dues on time. As a result, they were asked to get their outstanding rescheduled and start paying up in instalments.According to officials, the authority struggles to recover about Rs 25,000 crore in land dues from at least 100 developers. NO PENAL INTEREST ON DEFAULTERSThe authority has also decided to stop imposing penal interest against defaulting builders, as the UP government has waived it off in the wake of the pandemic. On June 9, the state government had asked the Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway authorities to reduce the interest rates on land dues for builders and other allottees in view of the coronavirus crisis.“Developers need to deposit dues without penal interest, restart construction and deliver flats to aggrieved homebuyers. The authority has waived off penal interest for developers. But realtors will have to submit an affidavit stating they will pass on the benefit to homebuyers,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer, Noida authority.Earlier, defaulter builders had to pay a penal interest of up to 20% on dues, thereby increasing the total default amount. The state government has asked authorities to levy simple interest on financial dues as per the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) revised by the Reserve Bank of India, said the officials. Now, the authorities shall levy simple interest of 8% on dues, said the officials. “It was a long standing demand of developers that the authority should not impose exorbitant penal interest up to 20% on dues as it affects the realty project’s economic viability. Now, the Supreme Court also directed the three authorities to levy only simple 7-8% interest on dues. It will revive the sector and enable developers to deliver stuck projects,” said RK Arora, Uttar Pradesh president of National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO), a developers’ group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-extends-date-for-rescheduling-of-land-dues-for-developers/story-nhCS3JCjMoAOryWgvHS8NL.html
21-06-2020||Noida||Noida admin reaches out to civil society for help in fight against Covid||The Gautam Budh Nagar administration has asked all residents welfare associations (RWA), apartment owners associations (AOA), village heads and other socially active residents or interested individuals in the district to come forward to and help in the fight against the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease in their respective areas.Officials said under this initiative, socially active citizens or groups in each residential sector, housing society or village would be encouraged to take on the role of ‘monitoring volunteers’ to help health workers in contact tracing of positive patients and screening processes. Officials said RWAs and AOAs have been told to buy pulse oximeters (small, handheld devices used to measure oxygen levels in the body) to screen suspected Covid patients. This is aimed at screening large numbers of people as soon as possible.“The idea is to detect Covid-positive patients at an early stage and provide them treatment without any delay. Six hundred teams of the district, each of which has two health workers, are engaged in door-to-door screening. We want that RWAs, AOAs, village heads or other interest individuals work together with these health workers in their respective areas so that the job is finished at the earliest,” said Narendra Bhooshan, the Greater Noida authority chief executive officer who is the nodal officer for the Noida district to handle the Covid-19 outbreak. The Uttar Pradesh government has appointed nodal officers at various levels to work effectively to reduce the death rate and also for better handling of the coronavirus cases across the state.By Saturday evening, there were a total of 1,303 positive coronavirus cases in the district. The tally includes the 41 new cases reported in past 24 hours.“With the help of a pulse oximeter, AOA or RWA office-bearers can check the oxygen level of a Covid-suspected person. If the oxygen level is between 95 and 100, it is considered to be normal. However if the oxygen level is below that, coupled with breathlessness, then those persons should get a Covid test done and treatment should be started. With this kind of help, AOAs, RWAs, and the like can play a very crucial role in fighting Covid-19 effectively,’ said Bhooshan.Residents’ bodies welcomed the move, with some having purchased pulse oximeters and other equipment already.“We welcome this step by the administration and will support the health teams identify those who need immediate medical help. We will coordinate with the administration accordingly. We have already purchased a pulse oximeter and an oxygen cylinder to help those who need it in the time of crisis. Many AOAs or RWAs have done this,” said Rajiva Singh, president of Noida Federation of AOA, an umbrella body with at least 70 housing societies under its wing. RWA bodies and social activists, meanwhile, said officials should keep them informed, for best results.“We are ready to work in coordination with the administration to fight Covid-19. But the administration must keep all RWAs in the loop while taking action related with Covid-19 operations in any given sector,” said NP Singh, president of Gautam Budh Nagar district development RWA, a residents’ body.“Awareness about Covid-19 is paramount to effectively fight the spread of the disease. And I as a socially active citizen am ready to extend help to the administration to contain the infection’s spread,” said Tikam Singh, a social activist from Sector 135.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-admin-reaches-out-to-civil-society-for-help-in-fight-against-covid/story-dS8DZdHxW9qCbiN7T99ucK.html
21-06-2020||Noida||Noida cop accused of assaulting Delhi health official at DND||A Noida police sub-inspector allegedly assaulted a deputy health officer with the Delhi government on Friday evening at the Delhi-Noida Direct Flyway border.The deputy, Dr. Saurabh Mishra, DHO with the west zone, was on his way home in sector 137 from Rajouri Garden, when the incident happened, according to Namrata Narayan, his wife.“It was around 6.30 pm when he passed the border. They have been travelling across the border for almost three months and have all the necessary documents. But yesterday, the driver was stopped by a constable while my husband was asleep in the back seat. The cop started harassing the driver asking him why the passenger was asleep,” said Namrata Narayan, his wife, adding that Mishra was unavailable to speak to the media.The doctor was then woken up and the constable allegedly told him also that this was no way to travel in a vehicle. According to Narayan, Mishra told the police constable that it was his vehicle. “By then he was out of the car. Suddenly, a sub-inspector came from behind who pulled my husband’s collar and started manhandling him. They even threatened to turn his vehicle away. They were behaving this way even though there was no problem with their documents or ID cards.Later, the sector 20 station house officer R K Singh came and sorted the matter. But this is no way for police to behave with an official or any person,” said Narayan.Mishra later filed a written complaint with the sector 20 police against the constable and the sub-inspector.Police officials have launched an inquiry in the matter while CCTV footage of the incident is also being scanned.“ACP 1 is handling the enquiry after which necessary disciplinary action will be taken,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Sankalp Sharma.Noida’s border with Delhi has been sealed since April with only essential services personnel or medical professionals being allowed to travel while Noida police claims to maintain checks for passes on both sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-cop-accused-of-assaulting-delhi-health-official-at-dnd/story-ZQI3gVVRA76VnWlYMsKLCN.html

Their petition also alleged that after their discharge from the hospital, they found that though the hospital is run by a charitable trust, owing to which it availed several facilities from the state government, but did not provide the mandatory free treatment to patients belonging to the lower strata of the society.The petition is scheduled to come up for further hearing on June 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/despite-reserving-90-beds-charitable-hospital-provided-covid-treatment-to-only-4-poor-patients/story-h89CWYe1rLTUaK3C5OvjrN.html
21-06-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana annuls tenders of two Chinese firms||The BJP-led Haryana government has decided to put in effect a trade ban on Chinese companies by annulling two tenders for installation of flue gas de-sulphurisation (FGD) system at their thermal power plants in Hisar and Yamunanagar.The works under the two tenders carried a financial implication of about ₹780 crore.Top officials said the lowest bidders (L-1) for both the tenders were Chinese firms – Beijing SPC Environment Protection Tech for Yamunanagar power plant and Shanghai Electric Corporation for the Hisar power plant. The prices quoted by the Chinese bidders were quite competitive, officials said.“We are going for a fresh tender with changed conditions. Only companies registered in India will be eligible to participate as per the terms and conditions of the new tender,” said a top official.The environment, forest and climate change ministry had in December 2015 issued new environmental norms for thermal power plants mandating installation of pollution control equipment. The state government decided to install the FGD system at its power generating plants in Hisar and Yamunanagar. National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) was appointed as the consultant. The Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited (HPGCL) invited applications through international competitive bidding route.A total of five bids, including three from Chinese companies, were received for Deen Bandhu Chhotu Ram Thermal Power Station in Yamunanagar. Indian bidder EPIL also participated in collaboration with a Chinese firm and M/s BHEL applied jointly with a non-Chinese foreign firm. Three companies, including two Chinese firms, participated in the tender for Hisar power plant. The third bidder was M/s BHEL which made a bid in foreign collaboration.“In the prevailing economic situation due to Covid-19 and in line with the Central government’s policies to encourage indigenous companies, it has been decided to scout for Indian firms for the project using the domestic bidding pattern,” said HPGCL managing director Mohammad Shayin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-govt-puts-trade-embargo-on-chinese-firms-annuls-two-tenders/story-9Qydd3qT0gCEwp9XjOH3HN.html

21-06-2020||World||A ‘second wave’ of coronavirus cases? Experts say first yet to get over||What’s all this talk about a “second wave” of US coronavirus cases?In The Wall Street Journal last week, Vice President Mike Pence wrote in a piece headlined “There Isn’t a Coronavirus ‘Second Wave’“ that the nation is winning the fight against the virus.Many public health experts, however, suggest it’s no time to celebrate. About 120,000 Americans have died from the new virus and there are worrisome recent increases in reported cases in the South and West.But there is at least one point of agreement: “Second wave” is probably the wrong term to describe what’s happening.“When you have 20,000-plus infections per day, how can you talk about a second wave?” said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health. “We’re in the first wave. Let’s get out of the first wave before you have a second wave.”Clearly there was an initial infection peak in April as cases exploded in New York City. After schools and businesses were closed across the country, the rate of new cases dropped somewhat.But “it’s more of a plateau, or a mesa,” not the trough after a wave, said Caitlin Rivers, a disease researcher at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security.Scientists generally agree the nation is still in its first wave of coronavirus infections, albeit one that’s dipping in some parts of the country while rising in others.“This virus is spreading around the United States and hitting different places with different intensity at different times,” said Dr. Richard Besser, chief executive of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation who was acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when a pandemic flu hit the U.S. in 2009.Dr. Arnold Monto, a University of Michigan flu expert, echoed that sentiment.“What I would call this is continued transmission with flare-ups,” he said.Flu seasons sometimes feature a second wave of infections. But in those cases, the second wave is a distinct new surge in cases from a strain of flu that is different than the strain that caused earlier illnesses.That’s not the case in the coronavirus epidemic.Monto doesn’t think “second wave” really describes what’s happening now, calling it “totally semantics.”“Second waves are basically in the eye of the beholder,” he said.But Besser said semantics matter, because saying a first wave has passed may give people a false sense that the worst is over.Some worry a large wave of coronavirus might occur this fall or winter — after schools reopen, the weather turns colder and less humid, and people huddle inside more. That would follow seasonal patterns seen with flu and other respiratory viruses. And such a fall wave could be very bad, given that there’s no vaccine or experts think most Americans haven’t had the virus.But the new coronavirus so far has been spreading more episodically and sporadically than flu, and it may not follow the same playbook.“It’s very difficult to make a prediction,” Rivers said. “We don’t know the degree to which this virus is seasonal, if at all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-second-wave-of-coronavirus-cases-experts-say-first-yet-to-get-over/story-I4Z7L6UVqx3jiO0SCCZkDI.html
21-06-2020||World||In a blow to Indians, Donald Trump says H-1B suspension coming any day now||President Donald Trump on Saturday confirmed reports of an impending suspension of non-immigrant work visas such as H-1B and L-1, which most impact Indian companies operating in the US and Indians hoping to work here, and said an announcement is expected “tomorrow or the next day”.“We’re going to be announcing something tomorrow or the next day on visas,” Trump said to a Fox News interviewer when asked about his plans to suspend these visas, which have been reported before widely, including by Hindustan Times. “And I think it’s going to make a lot of people happy. And it’s common sense, to be honest with you.”He refused to preview the details of the order, but linked it to the state of the economy struggling with record unemployment numbers caused by the lockdown of large parts of the US to fight off the coronavirus epidemic.“We have plenty of people looking for jobs,” he said.Asked if there will be exclusions, or exemptions, the president said there will be some to protect the flow of workers for big businesses”. He did not specify.President Trump had suspended most categories of immigration, in April, exempting relatives of US citizens and healthcare professional, to “ensure that unemployed Americans of all backgrounds will be first in line for jobs as our economy reopens”. Non-immigrants visas were spared at the time, but they are due any day now.The United States grants 85,000 H-1B short-term work visas to highly skilled foreign professional every year. More than 70% go to Indians hired either from among those enrolled here for higher studies or those brought from India. They are recruited both by US companies such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft and Indian IT services majors TCS, Infosys and Wipro.And L-1 visas are used for intra-company transfers.These visas, specially H-1Bs, have been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration for a long time, going way beyond the unemployment crisis brought on by the Covid-19 virus outbreak. Increased scrutiny, tighter rules and qualification standards started just weeks after Trump took office; with the issuance of the April 18, 2017 executive order rolling out his “Buy American,” Hire American” vision.Rejection rates of H-1B visas have been going up steadily since, as has been increased demands for additional information that that make the programme prohibitively tiresome and expensive, companies have said, by piling up the paperwork and costs. Many Indian companies have recalibrated their business models and ramped up local hiring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-blow-to-indians-donald-trump-says-h-1b-suspension-coming-any-day-now/story-g6ox7fm7KnatF4frYuQesO.html

The square reopened to the public a month ago and Italy’s last travel restrictions were lifted on June 3.“The lockdown has reduced pollution and revealed once more the beauty of so many places free from traffic and noise. Now, with the resumption of activities, we should all be more responsible for looking after our common home,” he said, using his term for the Earth.Air and water pollution levels plummeted in many places.In Venice, the usually dark waters of the city’s canals were so clean because of reduced boat traffic that fish could be seen for the first time in many years.Dolphins swam closer to ports, racoons emerged in New York’s Central Park and mountain goats roamed streets in Wales.In some cities, such as Milan, pollution reduction spurred officials to plan more pedestrian islands and cycling paths.The Roman Catholic Church is currently marking the fifth anniversary of Francis’ landmark encyclical “Laudato Si” (Praised Be) on the need to protect nature.In a 225-page manual released on Thursday, the Vatican said Catholics should disinvest from fossil fuel industries and closely monitor companies in sectors such as mining to check if they are damaging the environment.Francis, speaking a day after the United Nations World Refugee Day, also said the coronavirus crisis has highlighted the need to ensure protection for refugees because they had become more vulnerable to exploitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-says-coronavirus-should-spark-new-environmental-awareness/story-JAb3Dsc5LIBK4QoMlnY3OI.html

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was “appalled and sickened” by the incident. The UK’s terrorism threat level was lowered in November 2019 from ‘severe’ to ‘substantial’, which means an attack is likely.The attack took place on Saturday night in the Forbury Gardens in central Reading, which is about 65 km west of London. Witnesses said the park at the time was full of people, when the man walked through, shouted something and slashed at people.Neil Basu, the head of counter terrorism policing at Scotland Yard, said: “From our inquiries so far, officers have found nothing to suggest that there was anyone else involved in this attack and presently we are not looking for anyone else in relation to this incident.”He added: “Although the motivation for this horrific act is far from certain counter terrorism policing have taken responsibility for leading the investigation.”The local Thames Valley police sought video footage of the incident from the public, and urged people not circulate them on social media.Chief constable John Campbell: “I am deeply saddened by the events of last night. This was a truly tragic incident and the thoughts of Thames Valley Police are with all those who have been affected”.“Incidents of this nature are very rare, though I know that will be of little comfort to those involved and understand the concern that this incident will have caused amongst our local community”.“I would urge the public to avoid the area at this time and thank the community for their patience. We will let you know as soon as the area is back open. I would also ask that the public avoid speculation”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-people-stabbed-to-death-in-terror-attack-in-uk-town/story-1qh9HynE6BpdLfrmHVgrmN.html

Multinational PepsiCo suspended its operations in Beijing after confirmed Covid-19 cases were reported in the company, state media reported.All of PepsiCo’s 87 close contacts of a confirmed case in Beijing have been quarantined, and samples taken inside and outside its Beijing plant have come out negative.Officials have said around 2.3 million people have been tested in an effort to contain the outbreak in the capital that led to the closure of its biggest wholesale food market, Xinfadi, in the southwest district of Fengtai.China, where the outbreak began in December, had eased controls on travel and business as new cases fell.But monitoring and some other restrictions have been reimposed in some of the districts in Beijing where Covid-19 cases were detected.Tourist spots continue to be closed in the city over the weekend.The agency in charge of the Ming Tombs, a tourist site northwest of Beijing, said indoor areas will be closed as a safety precaution. Visitors are allowed in outdoor areas but are required to wear masks and be checked for feverBeijing health authorities are still investigating the source of the infection with preliminary sequencing of virus samples indicating a European strain.How it has spread, however, is still not clear.Emergence of Beijing’s Covid-19 cases are not considered a second wave, but a sudden outbreak within a small area, which is currently controllable, Chinese infectious disease expert Zhang Wenhong has said.A second wave, he explained, would have an obvious crest then descend after spreading for a while.“We hope that the domestic epidemic situation can (pursue) a strategy of close to zero cases, rather than absolute zero cases,” Zhang told state media.Zhang said he believes that the situation of “true zero cases” would be difficult to achieve in the current global epidemic situation.In Zhang’s view, there may be similar situations in other cities in China in the future, and unexpected outbreaks or small-scale outbreaks may occur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-hit-beijing-sees-227-cases-experts-say-outbreaks-possible-in-other-cities/story-HD1zXK1tojKgPl3d4GO5FL.html
21-06-2020||World||China may enact Hong Kong security law at end of June||China’s top lawmaking body has announced a three-day session for the end of this month, a move that raises the possibility of the enactment of a national security law for Hong Kong that has stirred debate and fears in the semi-autonomous territory.The official Xinhua News Agency said Sunday that the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress would meet from June 28 to 30 in Beijing.The brief report did not mention the Hong Kong security law among several possible discussion items, but it could still be on the agenda or added at the meeting.China released some details of the legislation late Saturday, heightening fears that the central government is tightening its grip on Hong Kong after months of anti-government protests last year.Under the draft, the central government would set up a national security office in Hong Kong that would collect and analyze intelligence and deal with criminal cases related to national security.Hong Kong police and courts would maintain jurisdiction over cases, but the law would allow an exception for Chinese authorities to exercise jurisdiction over “a tiny number of criminal cases ... under specific circumstances,” according to a Xinhua report.It did not provide any details on what those circumstances might be.The stationing of Chinese security officials in Hong Kong and their involvement in law enforcement would arguably be the most significant erosion to date of Hong Kong’s autonomy in local affairs under the “one country, two systems” principle that has guided the city since Britain returned the former colony to China in 1997.The draft says the new security law would prevail if local Hong Kong laws are inconsistent with it, Xinhua said. It would require the Hong Kong government to create a national security commission supervised by the central government. Beijing would also appoint a national security adviser for the city.The timing of the upcoming legislative session is unusual, coming just one week after a three-day meeting that ended Saturday, and suggests that China may be aiming to pass the law ahead of a July 1 holiday that marks Hong Kong’s return to China. The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress typically meets every two months.Last year, anti-government protesters smashed their way into the locked Hong Kong legislative complex on the anniversary, spray painting slogans on the walls and damaging the electronic voting system. The months of protests, in which Chinese flags were trampled on and the Chinese emblem on its Hong Kong office defaced, prompted the central government’s decision to enact the law.Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, called the draft law “a significant initiative ... at a critical moment” to ensure the long-term prosperity and stability of the city of 7.5 million people.The law will criminalize four acts: secession, subversion of state power, terrorist activities and colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security.“It will only target an extremely small minority of people who have breached the law” on those offenses, Lam said in a statement Saturday night, adding that “the life and property, basic rights and freedoms of the overwhelming majority of Hong Kong residents will be protected.”There had been speculation that the law would be enacted at the meeting that ended Saturday, but instead only partial details of the legislation were released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-may-enact-hong-kong-security-law-at-end-of-june/story-FOTp4wIgDMmLeOTdFK3heO.html

In the study, published in the journal JAMA Otolaryngology Head & Neck Surgery, scientists surveyed 204 Covid-19 patients and found that taste reduction was present in 55 per cent of them, whereas smell reduction was observed in about 41 per cent of the people. Based on the results of the survey, the researchers, including those from Humanitas University in Italy, said the reduction of taste and/or smell may be a frequent and early symptom of Covid-19. The telephone survey study investigated patients diagnosed with Covid-19 from March 5 to March 23, 2020, who were hospitalised or discharged from a medical centre. It said the patients who were unable to answer -- intubated, receiving noninvasive ventilation, or deceased, or unreachable by telephone -- were excluded from the study. “Of 359 consecutive patients, 204 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 76 were unable to answer, 76 were unreachable by telephone, and three refused,” the scientists noted in the study. The study said 116 patients reported reduction of taste and/or smell, while 113 participants noted they had taste reduction and 85 with smell reduction. “Severe reduction of taste was present in 81 patients (39.7 per cent), and severe reduction of smell was present in 72 patients (35.3 per cent),” the scientists noted in the study. They said only 12 patients with severe taste reduction, and 12 patients with severe smell reduction reported severe nasal obstruction. The researchers said severe reduction of taste and smell was more prevalent in female patients than in male patients, and in middle aged individuals more than in young people. “Our results showed a significant difference between reduction of taste and/or smell compared with the other sinonasal manifestations,” the study noted. Citing the limitations of the study, the scientists said the symptoms were self-reported, adding that further research involving more objective assessment of the patients for loss of smell and taste sensations may help validate the current findings. From the research, they believe general practitioners may play a major role in identifying potential Covid-19 cases at an early stage when taste or smell alterations manifest, and in suggesting quarantine for such patients before confirmation or exclusion of the diagnosis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/loss-of-smell-taste-symptoms-can-help-quarantining-potential-covid-19-patients-study/story-XnRwoldFpfX6cIdQDwrGoJ.html

Minnesota began allowing bars and restaurants to reopen with limited service on June 1 after some six weeks of closure because of the coronavirus pandemic.Photographs posted to social media showed windows at the Landmark’s Uptown Theatre and another storefront shot out.Screams were audible on a live video posted to Facebook that showed the aftermath at the scene. Small crowds of people gathered, with some crouched over victims lying on the pavement before police officers on bicycles showed up to attend to them. Splatters of blood were visible on the pavement after the victims were taken to local hospitals.The area is about 3 miles (5 kilometers) west of the Minneapolis commercial area and neighbourhood hit by rioting in the wake of George Floyd’s May 25 death after being arrested by Minneapolis police.Floyd’s death has sparked a move to overhaul the Minneapolis Police Department, with a majority of City Council members pledging support for dismantling a department that many community activists have called brutal and racist. That’s prompted pushback from opponents who question how citizens will be protected from violent crime. Even the most aggressive proponents for change have acknowledged it’s many months away and they’re not sure what it will look like.Calls and emails to Minneapolis police seeking more information weren’t immediately returned. Further details weren’t immediately available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-dead-11-injured-in-minneapolis-shooting/story-VcQS246F8yYXmp8HeFz1zM.html

IMBCAMS began on Saturday a phase 2 human test for its experimental shot, which is among six possible vaccines Chinese scientists are testing in humans, following an on-going phase-1 study that has recruited about 200 participants since May, the institute said on Sunday in its social media channel. The phase-2 trial will determine the shot’s dose and continue to evaluate whether the potential vaccine can safely trigger immune responses in healthy people.IMBCAMS said it expects to use a plant dedicated to producing a coronavirus vaccine this year to prepare for China’s future vaccine supplies.As early as by the end of 2020, certain groups of people with special needs can use experimental vaccines under urgent circumstances, Gao Fu, director at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said last month.The coronavirus, which was first detected in China late in 2019, has infected 8.81 million people globally and killed more than 460,000 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-researchers-launch-phase-2-human-test-for-possible-coronavirus-vaccine/story-hYBfBlgVbu40WIWzoFqbyI.html

His tough stance on immigration is central to his pitch to voters as he runs for re-election.Major American companies, particularly in the tech sector, have urged Trump to refrain from blocking the flow of foreign workers into the United States, saying it would hurt the economy.The new action would be Trump’s latest step to restrict immigration in response to the pandemic and economic fallout. In April, he ordered a temporary block on some foreigners from permanent residence in the United States.He also announced new health-focused rules in March that allow for the rapid deportation of immigrants caught at the border and virtually cut off access to the U.S. asylum system. At the same time, he announced the land borders with Canada and Mexico would be closed to non-essential crossings, a measure that has been extended several times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-will-announce-visa-restrictions-in-few-days-report/story-VOD5pxDwkNkyPFVZSBVnSI.html
21-06-2020||World||Australian state extends state of emergency as coronavirus cases spike||Australia’s second most populous state Victoria on Sunday extended its state of emergency for four more weeks to July 19, as it battles a spike in coronavirus infections with a pick-up in community transmission.The move came a day after the state announced it would reimpose restrictions capping visitors to households to five people and outdoor gatherings to 10, starting Monday. The limits had been relaxed on June 1 to allow up to 20 people in households and public gatherings.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageVictoria reported 19 new infections on Sunday, the fifth day of double digit-rises. The state has now had 1,836 total confirmed cases, or a quarter of the cases in Australia, since the Covid-19 pandemic erupted.Sunday’s tally in Victoria included an Australia Rules football player, the first in the league to test positive, whose team and coaching staff have been told to isolate.The surge in Victoria has alarmed other states, which have had only a few, if any, new cases for several weeks. Western Australia, which shut its borders in April, said it would weigh Victoria’s situation in determining when to reopen its borders.Australian health officials, however, still see no need to require use of face masks, as they would have limited value in a country where absolute numbers of community transmission remain “very low”, deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth said.Avoiding hugging and kissing was “arguably far more important than, say, wearing masks”, he said.Victorian state health minister Jenny Mikakos said 210 of the state’s cases are believed tied to community transmission, partly blaming families who have had parties, lunches and dinners attended by people with mild symptoms since restrictions were eased on June 1.“We obviously have been concerned by the increasing numbers that we have seen in recent days. It is still a very serious situation,” Mikakos said at a televised media conference in Melbourne.State police said they planned to step up enforcement efforts, especially in suburbs where there have been breakouts and patrolling ski resorts and camper-van parks during the upcoming school holidays.Individuals caught breaching restrictions face fines of up to A$1,652 ($1,129) for individuals and A$9,913 for businesses.“This is not the time to be complacent,” Victoria’s police minister, Lisa Neville, told reporters.The Australian Industry Group, which represents a wide range of employers, said Victoria’s tightening of restrictions again, including extending working from home through to the end of July, would make it harder for businesses to reopen later.“The economic impact unfortunately will be hard and harsh,” Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox said.

21-06-2020||World||‘Ring of fire’ solar eclipse to dim Africa, Asia||Skywatchers along a narrow band from west Africa to the Arabian Peninsula, India and southern China will witness on Sunday a dramatic “ring of fire” solar eclipse.So-called annular eclipses occur when the Moon -- passing between Earth and the Sun -- is not quite close enough to our planet to completely obscure sunlight, leaving a thin ring of the solar disc visible.They happen every year or two, and can only been seen from a narrow pathway across the planet.Were the Moon just a wee bit closer -- 379,100 rather than 381,500 kilometres away -- Earthlings would be treated to a total blackout, visible at a given spot on our planet about every 400 years.Remarkably, the eclipse Sunday arrives on the northern hemisphere’s longest day of the year -- the summer solstice -- when Earth’s north pole is tilted most directly towards the Sun.The “ring of fire” will first be seen in northeastern Republic of Congo at 5:56 local time (04:56 GMT) just a few minutes after sunrise. This is the point of maximum duration, with the blackout lasting 1 minute and 22 seconds.Arcing eastward across Africa and Asia, it will reach “maximum eclipse” -- with a perfect solar halo around the Moon -- over Uttarakhand, India near the Sino-Indian border at 12:10 local time (6:40 GMT).More spectacular, but less long-lived: the exact alignment of the Earth, Moon and Sun will be visible for only 38 seconds. “The annular eclipse is visible from about two percent of Earth surface,” Florent Delefie, an astronomer and the Paris Observatory, told AFP.“It’s a bit like switching from a 500-watt to a 30-watt light bulb,” he added. “It’s a cold light, and you don’t see as well.”- Good weather key -Animals can get spooked -- birds will sometimes go back to sleep, and cows will return to the barn.The full eclipse will be visible at successive locations over a period of nearly four hours, and one of the last places to see a partially hidden Sun is Taiwan before.People hundreds of kilometres on either side of the centreline across 14 countries will also see light drain from the day, but not the “ring of fire”.Weather conditions are critical for viewing.“Good weather is the key to successful eclipse viewing,” astrophysicist Fred Espenak, an expert on eclipse prediction, commented on the NASA Eclipse website. “Better to see a shorter eclipse from clear sky than a longer eclipse under clouds.”A solar eclipse always occurs about two weeks before or after a lunar eclipse, when the Moon moves into Earth’s shadow. Lunar eclipses are visible from about half of Earth’s surface.There will be a second solar eclipse in 2020 on December 14 over South America. Because the Moon will be a bit closer to Earth, it will block on the Sun’s light entirely. Even if the day has darkened, looking at a solar eclipse with the naked eye is dangerous. Sunglasses -- which don’t filter out UV rays -- do not offer any protection, Delefie warned.“The Sun is so bright that even when there’s only a tiny portion visible, it is still dangerous for the eyes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ring-of-fire-solar-eclipse-to-dim-africa-asia/story-79bgY8gJGrp6VywcCOgpJN.html
21-06-2020||World||South Korea records 48 new Covid-19 cases, some outside Seoul||South Korea has reported 48 new cases of Covid-19 as health authorities struggle to contain a resurgence that’s erasing some of the country’s hard-won gains against the virus.Figures released by the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday brought the national caseload to 12,421 confirmed infections including 280 deaths.It said 24 of the new cases came from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, which have been the centre of the country’s outbreak since late May.Ten others were reported from the central city of Daejeon, indicating that the virus was beginning to spread more broadly, apparently as a result of increased public activity and complacency in social distancing.The KCDC said nearly 200 infections so far have been linked to employees at a door-to-door sales company in Seoul, which mostly hired people over 60. Seventy other cases were linked to a table tennis club in another part of Seoul, where members also passed the virus at a church.Health authorities earlier found hundreds of cases linked to nightspots, e-commerce workers and church gatherings.While some experts say the country should reimpose stronger social distancing guidelines after easing them in mid-April, officials have been reluctant to do so over concerns of hurting an already fragile economy.In other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:Chinese authorities reported 25 new confirmed cases — 22 in Beijing and three in neighbouring Hebei province. They say 2.3 million people have been tested in an effort to contain the outbreak in the capital that led to the closure of its biggest wholesale food market. China, where the outbreak began in December, had eased controls on travel and business as new cases fell. But monitoring and some other restrictions have been reimposed following the recent jump in infections. The Beijing health commission gave no details of where the latest cases might have originated. The Chinese capital’s biggest wholesale food market was closed June 13 after dozens of people who worked there tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-records-48-new-covid-19-cases-some-outside-seoul/story-XvhCWfOmySVZJ3AJzliR6L.html
21-06-2020||World||Japanese PM Shinzo Abe’s public support rises despite ex-justice minister’s arrest||Public support for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s cabinet rose by nine percentage points to 36% despite the recent arrest of his former justice minister on suspicion of vote-buying, a poll by the Mainichi Shimbun daily showed on Sunday.The approval rating had fallen to 27% in the paper’s previous survey conducted soon after a senior Tokyo prosecutor who was seen close to the premier resigned in late May for gambling during Japan’s coronavirus state of emergency.A drop in voter support below 30% is often seen as a danger sign. The Mainichi report on its latest survey does not give specific reasons for the rebound in support, but 55% of those polled welcomed the government’s decision on Thursday to lift curbs on domestic travels.That compares with 32% of those surveyed who said the restrictions should have remained in place. Prosecutors on Thursday arrested former justice minister Katsuyuki Kawai, a one-time foreign policy adviser close to Abe, and Kawai’s lawmaker wife, Anri, on suspicion of vote-buying in a 2019 upper-house election. Although support for Abe’s government rebounded, 59% of those surveyed believe Abe has heavy responsibility for the matter.Abe has apologised to the public over the scandal, saying he felt his responsibility strongly for his appointment of Kawai to the post.The Mainichi survey also showed that 59% of those polled do not believe the Tokyo Olympics, originally scheduled for July and August this year but postponed by one year due to the coronavirus pandemic, can be held next year. Only 21% believe the event can be held in 2021. Japan has not suffered the explosive surge of coronavirus infections seen in some other countries, with about 18,000 confirmed cases and 954 deaths, according to public broadcaster NHK.

21-06-2020||World||Tensions flare at protests outside Donald Trump’s rally in Tulsa||President Donald Trump’s supporters faced off with protesters shouting “Black Lives Matter” Saturday in Tulsa as the president held his first campaign rally in months amid public health concerns about the coronavirus and fears that the event could lead to violence in the wake of killings of Black people by police.Hundreds of marchers flooded the city’s downtown streets and blocked traffic at times, but police reported just one arrest as of Saturday afternoon. Many on foot chanted, and some occasionally got into shouting matches with Trump supporters, who outnumbered them and yelled, “all lives matter.” Later in the evening, a group of armed men began following the protesters. When the protesters blocked an intersection, a man wearing a Trump shirt got out of a truck and spattered them with pepper spray. Police later deployed an irritant gas to try and make the group disperse.The Trump faithful gathered inside the 19,000-seat BOK Center for what was believed to be the largest indoor event in the country since restrictions to prevent the Covid-19 virus began in March. Many of the president’s supporters weren’t wearing masks, despite the recommendation of public health officials to keep the coronavirus from spreading. Some had been camped near the venue since early in the week.Turnout at the rally was lower than the campaign predicted, with a large swath of standing room on the stadium floor and empty seats in the balconies. Trump had been scheduled to appear at a rally outside of the stadium within a perimeter of tall metal barriers, but that event was abruptly cancelled.Trump campaign officials said protesters prevented the president’s supporters from entering the stadium. Three Associated Press journalists reporting in Tulsa for several hours leading up to the president’s speaking did not see protesters block entry to the area where the rally was held.While Trump spoke onstage, protesters carried a paper machete representation of him with pig snout. Some in the multiracial group wore Black Lives Matter shirts, others sported rainbow-colored armbands, and many covered their mouths and noses with masks. At one point, several people stopped to dance to gospel singer Kirk Franklin’s song “Revolution.” The protesters blocked traffic in at least one intersection. Some Black leaders in Tulsa have said they’re worried the visit could lead to violence. It’s happening amid protests over racial injustice and policing across the U.S. and in a city that has a long history of racial tension. Officials said they expected some 100,000 people in Tulsa’s downtown.The woman who was arrested was seen on live video sitting cross-legged on the ground in peaceful protest when officers pulled her away by the arms and later put her in handcuffs. She said her name was Sheila Buck and that she was from Tulsa.Police said in a news release the officers tried for several minutes to talk Buck into leaving and that she was taken into custody for obstruction after police were asked by the Trump campaign to remove her from the area.Buck was wearing a T-shirt that said “I Can’t Breathe” — the dying words of George Floyd, whose death has inspired a global push for racial justice. She she had a ticket to the Trump rally and was told she was being arrested for trespassing. She said she was not part of any organized group.Several blocks away from the BOK Center was a festival-like atmosphere, with food vendors serving hot dogs and cold drinks and sidewalks lined with people selling various Trump regalia.There was also an undercurrent of tension near the entrance to the secured area, where Trump supporters and opponents squared off. Several downtown businesses boarded up their windows as well to avoid any potential damage.Kieran Mullen, 60, a college professor from Norman, Oklahoma, held a sign that read, “Black Lives Matter” and “Dump Trump.” “I just thought it was important for people to see there are Oklahomans that have a different point of view,” Mullen said of his state, which overwhelmingly supported Trump in 2016.Brian Bernard, 54, a retired information technology worker from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, sported a Trump 2020 hat as he took a break from riding his bicycle around downtown Tulsa. Next to him was a woman selling Trump T-shirts and hats, flying a “Keep America Great Again” flag. Her shirt said, “Impeach this,” with an image of Trump extending his middle fingers.“Since the media won’t do it, it’s up to us to show our support,” said Bernard, who drove nine hours to Tulsa for his second Trump rally.Bernard said he wasn’t concerned about catching the coronavirus at the event and doesn’t believe it’s “anything worse than the flu.” Across the street, armed, uniformed highway patrol troopers milled about a staging area in a bank parking lot with dozens of uniformed National Guard troops.Tulsa has seen cases of Covid-19 spike in the past week, and the local health department director asked that the rally be postponed. But Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt said it would be safe. The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Friday denied a request that everyone attending the indoor rally wear a mask, and few in the crowd outside Saturday were wearing them.The Trump campaign said six staff members helping prepare for the event tested positive for COVID-19. They were following “quarantine procedures” and wouldn’t attend the rally, said Tim Murtaugh, the campaign’s communications director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tensions-flare-at-protests-outside-donald-trump-s-rally-in-tulsa/story-hgTk8HEUX2fjt5zDB5MD8L.html
21-06-2020||World||‘Covid-19 testing double-edged sword, asked my people to slow it down’ : US President Donald Trump||US President Donald Trump on Saturday told supporters at an election rally in Oklahoma’s Tulsa that he had ordered officials to slow down testing for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as it led to more cases.“You know testing is a double-edged sword,” Trump said. “When you do testing to that extent you’re going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down.”The United States has the most Covid-19 infections in the world - more than 2.25 million - and fatalities at close to 1,12,000. His own experts have recommended increased testing to get ahead of the epidemic and it was a stunning admission from the president that he had asked for it to be slowed down.The Biden campaign has slammed the president’s admission as an “an outrageous moment” saying Trump “is putting politics ahead of the safety and economic well-being of the American people”.Trump is in a hurry to reopen the country and get its economy running back again, with an eye on his re-election prospects in November. Even the rally he addressed on Saturday in Tulsa, which was meant to meant to mark his return to the campaign trail after three months, was staged amidst widespread concerns about so many people congregating in a tight place with no scope of social distancing.Just hours before the president was scheduled to take the stage, his campaign announced that six members of an advance team on ground in Tulsa had tested positive for Covid-19. But that had little or no salutary effect on the organisers or supporters. Few people wore masks, including the president and all the other speakers who preceded him. In the stands, there was no observance of social distancing norms recommended by the president’s own experts and federal agencies fighting the epidemic.The president was excited about returning to the campaign trail and the promise of a massive turnout had added to the build-up. Based on an estimated one million RSVPs, the campaign had planned an indoor rally and one outdoors for the spillover crowd. No one showed up for the outdoor event, and stands in the indoor venue had many empty seats.Evidently surprised and embarrassed, the campaign sought to blame protesters and media for the low turnout. “Radical protesters, coupled with a relentless onslaught from the media, attempted to frighten off the president’s supporters. We are proud of the thousands who stuck it out,” Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman, said.Sporadic incidents of clashes were witnessed between Trump supporters and protestors, but not as widespread or of a scale as portrayed by the Trump campaign. Police used pepper balls in one instance, Tulsaworld, a local news publication, reported. One protester was also arrested.In a speech lasting almost two hours, the president slammed his presumptive Democratic rival Joe Biden, the former vice-president, who is seeking to tie him to the anti-racism protests that ripped through the country over the past weeks, marked by violence, looting and clashes with law enforcements forces.The president also reeled off a list of his administration’s achievements that read like a compilation of points covered many times in his tweets. The president spent quite a bit of time counter attacking questions raised about his health after he was seen using both hands to lift a glass a water to his lips and for shuffling off a ramp from the stage. He went on to drink from a glass using just one hand to prove his point, to cheers from his supporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-testing-double-edged-sword-asked-my-people-to-slow-it-down-us-president-donald-trump/story-U8WO94L8MMfTbQCw4ZICiN.html
21-06-2020||World||‘More testing means more cases, slow it down’: Trump’s advice to Covid-19 responders||US President Donald Trump said Saturday he was encouraging coronavirus response workers to slow down testing, arguing that increased tests lead to more cases being discovered.The president has claimed falsely on several occasions that surges of Covid-19 in several states can be explained by increased diagnostic tests.At his first rally since the outbreak forced nationwide shutdowns in March, Trump told the crowd in Tulsa, Oklahoma that testing was a “double-edged sword.” The US -- which has more deaths and cases than any other country -- has carried out around 27 million coronavirus tests, placing it 26th in the world, per capita.“Here is the bad part: When you do testing to that extent, you are going to find more people, you will find more cases,” Trump argued. “So I said ‘slow the testing down.’ They test and they test.”It was not clear from Trump’s tone if he was playing to the crowd, which cheered as he spoke, or if he was being serious.Coronavirus cases have spiked in several states, including Oklahoma, and local health officials had asked Trump to postpone the rally, fearing it would contribute to the spread. Six members of an advance team working in Tulsa ahead of the rally tested positive for Covid-19, the Trump campaign said just hours before the president took the stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-admits-urging-covid-19-responders-to-slow-testing/story-exCqwLxFaSSBZiq3jY3GnO.html
21-06-2020||World||Top Manhattan prosecutor Berman leaves job after standoff with Barr||An extraordinary standoff between the Justice Department and Manhattan US Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman ended Saturday when the prosecutor agreed to leave his job with an assurance that his investigations into allies of President Donald Trump would not be disturbed.The announcement capped two days of conflicting statements, allegations of political interference in prosecutions, and defiance from Berman. On Saturday, Attorney General William Barr said Berman’s refusal to resign under pressure prompted Trump to fire him. Trump tried to distance himself from the dispute, telling reporters the decision “was all up to the attorney general.”This episode deepened tensions between the Justice Department and congressional Democrats, who have accused Barr of politicizing the agency and acting more like Trump’s personal lawyer than the country’s chief law enforcement officer. It also raised questions about ongoing investigations in the Southern District of New York, most notably a probe into Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney.Barr set off the whirlwind chain of events on Friday night with a surprise announcement that Berman was resigning, without explanation. But Berman insisted he had not resigned, was not stepping down and his investigations would continue.On Saturday morning, he showed up to work, telling reporters, “I’m just here to do my job.”Hours later, Barr announced Berman’s firing.“Unfortunately, with your statement of last night, you have chosen public spectacle over public service,” Barr wrote in a letter released by the Justice Department. He said the idea that Berman had to continue on the job to safeguard investigations was “false.”Although Barr said Trump had removed Berman, the president told reporters: “That’s all up to the attorney general. Attorney General Barr is working on that. That’s his department, not my department.” Trump added: “I wasn’t involved.”The administration’s push to cast aside Berman amounted to a political and constitutional clash between the Justice Department and one of the nation’s top districts, which has tried major mob, financial crimes and terrorism cases over the years.Only days ago, allegations surfaced from former Trump national security adviser John Bolton that the president sought to interfere in an investigation by Berman’s office into the state-owned Turkish bank in an effort to cut deals with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.Berman initially vowed to stay on the job until a replacement was confirmed. He changed his mind late Saturday after Barr said he would allow Berman’s second in command, Deputy US Attorney Audrey Strauss, to become acting US attorney.Berman said Strauss’ appointment signaled that Barr had decided “to respect the normal operation of law.” He said he was stepping down immediately.The administration’s efforts to replace Berman with a handpicked replacement, however, were already running into roadblocks before Barr agreed to install Strauss.After announcing Berman’s resignation, the White House said it was nominating Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton, a well-connected Wall Street lawyer with virtually no experience as a federal prosecutor, for the job.But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a close Trump ally, said he was unlikely to proceed with Clayton’s nomination unless New York’s senators, Democrats Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, gave their consent to the pick.Schumer said the bid to oust Berman “reeks of potential corruption of the legal process,” and Gillibrand said she would “not be complicit” in helping fire a prosecutor investigating corruption. Both lawmakers called for Clayton to withdraw from consideration.Schumer also called for the department’s inspector general and Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate Berman’s ouster. And the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said Berman has an open invitation to testify before his panel.Berman, a Republican who contributed to the president’s election campaign, worked for the same law firm as Giuliani and was personally interviewed by Trump before being tapped as US attorney. But he won over some skeptics after overseeing numerous prosecutions and investigations with ties to Trump.Though Berman is said to be unclear about the exact reason he was fired, people familiar with his thinking said his job had always seemed in jeopardy and he never had the sense it was secure.Among the most high profile investigations he was overseeing was into Giuliani’s business dealings, including whether he failed to register as a foreign agent. Charges in the case do not appear imminent, according to people familiar with the matter. They were not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.The Southern District has also prosecuted a number of Trump associates, including Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who served a prison sentence for lying to Congress and campaign finance crimes. Cohen was recently released from a federal prison to continue serving his sentence on home confinement over coronavirus concerns.Berman has overseen the prosecution of two Florida businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were associates of Giuliani and tied to the Ukraine impeachment investigation. The men were charged in October with federal campaign finance violations, including hiding the origin of a $325,000 donation to a group supporting Trump’s reelection.Under Berman’s tenure, his office also brought charges against Michael Avenatti, the combative lawyer who gained fame by representing porn actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits involving Trump. Avenatti was convicted in February of trying to extort Nike after prosecutors said he threatened to use his media access to hurt Nike’s reputation and stock price unless the sportswear giant paid him up to $25 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-manhattan-prosecutor-berman-leaves-job-after-standoff-with-barr/story-jvzCcQUREfGKxD7Ycd0zMO.html
21-06-2020||World||North Korea vows to send anti-South leaflets amid tensions||North Korea pledged to push ahead with its campaign to send propaganda leaflets into South Korea, saying it is not bound to any inter-Korean agreements, state media said on Sunday.Tension has been rising after North Korea blew up a joint liaison office and threatened military action over defectors in the South sending anti-North leaflets across the border.As state media reported angry North Koreans gearing up for their own “large-scale” leaflet campaign, Seoul’s Unification Ministry handling cross-border affairs on Saturday urged the plan to be scrapped citing a violation of peace agreements.The United Front Department of the North’s ruling party, in charge of inter-Korean affairs, rejected the ministry’s calls as an “absurd nonsense.”“Given their own wrongdoings, how dare they utter such words as regret and violation?” the department’s spokesman said in a statement carried by state media KCNA.“When they are put in our shoes, the South Korean authorities will be able to understand even a bit how disgustedly we looked at them and how offending it was for us.”The two Koreas, which are still technically at war as their 1950-53 conflict ended without a peace treaty, have waged leaflet campaigns for decades but agreed to cease “all hostile acts” in a 2018 peace accord.Several defector-led groups have regularly sent back flyers, together with food, $1 bills, mini radios and USB sticks containing South Korean dramas and news, usually by balloon over the border or in bottles in rivers.One of the groups dropped a plan to float hundreds of plastic bottles stuffed with rice, medicine and face masks into the sea near the border on Sunday.Pyongyang has also used balloons and drones to fly its anti-South leaflets, which in South Korea in the past have been rewarded with stationery if reported to police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-vows-to-send-anti-south-leaflets-amid-tensions/story-ho08EwycQ8QoOtYB9winLN.html
21-06-2020||World||Trump comeback rally features empty seats, staff infections||President Donald Trump pressed ahead Saturday with a comeback rally amid a pandemic by declaring “the silent majority is stronger than ever before,” but what was meant to be a show of political force was instead met with thousands of empty seats and new coronavirus cases on his campaign staff.Ignoring health warnings, Trump scheduled the rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It was intended to be the largest indoor gathering in the world during the outbreak that has killed more than 120,000 Americans, put 40 million more out of work and upended Trump’s reelection bid. But in the hours before the event, crowds seemed significantly lighter than expected. Campaign officials scrapped plans for Trump to first address an overflow space.Trump tried to explain away the crowd size, blaming it on the media for declaring “don’t go, don’t come, don’t do anything” while insisting there were protesters outside “doing bad things,” though the small crowds of prerally demonstrators were largely peaceful.“We begin our campaign,” Trump thundered. “The silent majority is stronger than ever before.”But huge swaths of empty seats remained in the downtown arena before Trump was to take the stage. And that came on the heels of the campaign revealing that six staff members who were helping set up for the event had tested positive for the virus. Campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said that “quarantine procedures were immediately implemented,” and that neither the affected staffers nor anyone who was in immediate contact with them would attend the event.News of the infections came just a short time before Trump departed for Oklahoma, and the president raged to aides that it was made public, according to two White House and campaign officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.Large gatherings in the United States were shut down in March because of the coronavirus. The rally was scheduled over the protests of local health officials as Covid-19 cases spike in many states, while the choice of host city and date — it was originally set for Friday, Juneteenth, only to be moved a day — prompted anger amid a national wave of protests against racial injustice.But Trump and his advisers forged forward, believing that a return to the rally stage would reenergize the president, who is furious that he has fallen behind Democrat Joe Biden in polls, and reassure Republicans growing anxious about the state of the presidential race and their ability to hold onto the Senate. But the smaller-than-expected crowds may only increase GOP worries.The president’s campaign tried to point fingers elsewhere, but the protests outside the arena, which also were smaller than expected, remain largely peaceful in the hours before the event.“Sadly, protestors interfered with supporters, even blocking access to the metal detectors, which prevented people from entering the rally,” Murtaugh said in a statement. “Radical protestors, coupled with a relentless onslaught from the media, attempted to frighten off the President’s supporters. We are proud of the thousands who stuck it out.”In the minutes before the president arrived at the downtown arena, Trump supporters who signed up for tickets received a text urging them to show up, declaring, “There’s still space!”It’s been more than three months since the nation last saw a Trump rally. The unemployment rate stood at about 3.5% that March 2. The number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. was estimated at 91.Now, the unemployment rate stands at 13.3%, based on the most recent monthly report. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has soared to about 2.2 million. The number of deaths reported in the U.S. has surpassed 119,000. Outrage over the criminal justice system’s treatment of minorities following the death of George Floyd and other African Americans has spawned protests around the nation. Only about a quarter of Americans say the country is headed in the right direction.Trump was determined to return to his signature campaign events. He dismissed complaints that bringing together throngs for an indoor rally risked spreading the coronavirus as nothing more than politics.Trump’s visit also raised fears of clashes between protesters and Trump supporters, and there were brief confrontations Saturday afternoon. But the crowds were not materializing despite the president’s bravado.“Big crowds and lines already forming in Tulsa. My campaign hasn’t started yet. It starts on Saturday night in Oklahoma!” Trump tweeted Friday.City officials had expected a crowd of 100,000 people or more in downtown Tulsa. Trump’s campaign, for its part, declared that it had received over a million ticket requests. The crowd that gathered was far less than that, though the rally, being broadcast on cable, will also target voters in battleground states such as Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida.The campaign said it would hand out masks and hand sanitizer, but there was no requirement that participants use them. Participants were also to undergo a temperature check.“I don’t think it’s anything worse than the flu,” said Brian Bernard, 54, a retired IT worker from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, who sported a Trump 2020 hat. “I haven’t caught a cold or a flu in probably 15 years, and if I haven’t caught a cold or flu yet, I don’t think I’m gonna catch Covid.”Trump has generally held his campaign rallies in swing states or in Democratic-leaning states such as Colorado or New Mexico that he hopes to flip this November. Oklahoma fits none of those categories. The last Democratic candidate to emerge victorious there in a presidential election was Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Trump won the state with more than 65% of the vote in the 2016 election. The Republican stronghold gives Trump more assurance that he’ll face little resistance to his efforts from top state officials.The rally was originally scheduled for Friday, but it was moved back a day following an uproar that it otherwise would have happened on Juneteenth, and in a city where a 1921 white-on-Black attack killed as many as 300 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-comeback-rally-features-empty-seats-staff-infections/story-rhwLfCFamCslM6eyqKmvRM.html

21-06-2020||World||Serbians head to polls in Europe’s first post-lockdown election||Serbians go to polls on Sunday to elect a new parliament in Europe’s first national election since coronavirus lockdowns took effect some three months ago, with the ruling conservatives seen winning a comfortable majority.Polling stations will be equipped with face masks and hand sanitisers for the use of the country’s 5.5 million voters, many of whom are expected to skip voting - partly due to fears of becoming infected.Turnout could also be hit by the boycott campaign of some opposition parties, who say the vote will not be free or fair due to President Aleksandar Vucic’s firm grip over the media.According to the latest opinion polls, Vucic’s conservative Serbian Peoples’ Party (SNS) is set to garner about 50% of the vote, boosted by widespread public approval over the government’s handling of the pandemic.Vucic’s coalition partner, the Socialist Party, is expected to come second with about 10%, while an opposition centre-right party led by Aleksandar Sapic, the mayor of a Belgrade municipality, is tipped to come third.Vucic himself is not up for re-election, but the opposition parties that are boycotting the poll accuse him of using his position as president to promote his party.Serbia, which has a population of 7.2 million, has so far reported 12,803 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 260 deaths. It was among the first European countries to start opening its borders on May 22 and all lockdown curbs have since been lifted.Still, persistent health concerns will keep some voters at home, especially among higher-risk groups.“A number of voters above 65 will not vote because they are afraid they could get infected,” Bojan Klacar, executive director of the CESID pollster told Reuters.Voters largely back efforts by Vucic’s ruling coalition to push for Serbian membership of the European Union while maintaining strong ties with Russia and China.But the future government will face increasing EU and U.S. pressure to recognise the independence of Serbia’s former province of Kosovo, a move seen as key for regional stability.

He said no one who had immediate contact with those staffers would attend, either.Murtaugh said campaign staff members are tested for Covid-19 as part of the campaign’s safety protocols.Campaign officials say everyone who is attending the rally will be given temperature checks before they pass through security. They will also be given masks to wear, if they want, and hand sanitizer at the 19,000-seat BOK Center.The rally is expected to be the biggest indoor event the country has seen since restrictions to prevent the coronavirus from spreading began in March.Tulsa has seen cases of Covid-19 spike in the past week, and the local health department director asked that the rally be postponed. But Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt said it would be safe. The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Friday denied a request that everyone attending the indoor rally wear a mask, and few in the crowd outside Saturday were wearing them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-staffers-setting-up-for-trump-rally-positive-for-covid-19/story-3tz7FrySBJCvXX8k1c48rJ.html
21-06-2020||World||Is Covid-19 more fatal for men than women?||While experts and scientists are ramping up effort to arrive at the potential Covid-19 vaccine, a vast body of research exists and focusses on the other aspects of the contagious disease and how it is affecting the world. Experts have now come to conclude that Covid-19 is posing a greater threat to the male population as opposed to females. More men are getting infected by the disease as opposed to women. Experts also believe that the biological differences between the two sexes should be taken into consideration for developing treatments and vaccines for Covid-19.Also read: Ramp up Covid-19 testing in containment zones, hospitals - ICMR to states“Around the world, on every continent, we’re observing that men are significantly more likely to be hospitalized with severe Covid-19, and men are also significantly more likely to die from Covid-19. Some studies are showing the risks are twofold for men. Women are contracting the virus at same rates as men, but they are more likely to recover,” noted a research entry by Johns Hopkins University, which also calls for a deeper investigation. The research points to the fact that women typically have a more rapid and robust immune response to viruses than men which “may be one factor contributing to female-biased protection against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19”. “There are data from early outbreaks in Wuhan, China, for example, that show women clear the virus more quickly than men,” the piece reads.Also read: Glenmark launches Covid-19 drug after DCGI nodDifferences in sexes also affect immunity. “We have data for other viruses illustrating that sex differences in immunity are caused by genetic as well as hormonal differences between women and men,” it stated.Another recently conducted study says that as of May 20, 2020, males shared a higher burden (66 per cent) of Covid-19 infections than females (34 per cent) but the infection is more or less evenly distributed in under-five as well as elderly age groups.Males are at a greater disadvantage than females, they said, adding that it is unclear whether males experience a higher risk of mortality throughout the age-spectrum, or if there are sex-related differences in survival risk.“While males have a higher overall burden (66 per cent) of Covid-19 infections than females, the infection is evenly distributed in the under-five age group and, to some extent, even among the elderly age groups (particularly 70+ years),” the scientists wrote in the study which was published in the Journal of Global Health Science.Coronavirus has infected over 8 million people across the globe while over 4.6 people have lost their lives to the deadly contagion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-covid-19-more-fatal-for-men-than-women/story-165RtYcxuUqThiIGdaL8ZK.html
21-06-2020||India||Security forces gun down three terrorists in Srinagar||Security forces shot dead three terrorists in a gunfight in Jammu and Kashmir’s Srinagar after they refused to surrender on Sunday, officials said. This was the second such operation in the city in just over a month.Vijay Kumar, Kashmir inspector general of police, said one of the militants — a local resident — was involved in the killing of two Border Security Force (BSF) personnel near the city’s Pandach Chowk during Ramzan May 20.He was identified as Shakoor Farooq Langoo of Bharthana near Srinagar. The second militant, Shahid Ahmad Bhat, was a resident of Semthan Bijbehara in South Kashmir, while the third person was yet to be identified.They were affiliated to the Hizbul Mujahideen, a banned local group, and the Kashmir unit of the Islamic State, according to the police, who said the terrorists were working jointly. Security personnel launched the operation after receiving intelligence inputs about their presence in a house in the densely populated Zadibal in downtown Srinagar late on Saturday night. Subsequently, the police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) launched a cordon-and-search operation in the area’s Zoonimar.“Through our sources, we go to know of their identity and called their parents who appealed to them to surrender. But they didn’t relent...after that, an operation was launched to neutralize them,” he said.The house owner and people from nearby houses were evacuated successfully, and the terrorists cornered during the operation.“Your mother is suffering from a heart ailment. Come out and surrender. They will help you,” the uncle of one of the terrorists said. The mother of one of them, with tears in her eyes, urged her son to lay down his arms, according to news agency PTI.A police spokesperson said security forces showed patience and restraint, and ensured a “clean operation with no collateral damage in a highly congested and densely populated area of Srinagar”.Mobile internet services were suspended in the city view of the operation.The operation came less than 24 hours of security forces killing a terrorist, a Pakistani national, at Likhdipora village in south Kashmir’s Kulgam district. The police spokesperson said he was identified as Tayab Waleed, alias Imran Bhai, alias Gazi Baba, who was affiliated to the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed.According to police records, he was the operational commander of the JeM and an expert in making improvised explosive devices (IEDS), besides being a sharp shooter. One AK rifle, one M-4 Carbine, and a pistol, among others, were recovered from the encounter.Security personnel have stepped up the offensive in the Kashmir Valley, killing over 100 terrorists in operations since the beginning of the year. Several of these encounters have taken place in south Kashmir, considered the hotbed of militancy. Among the major successes of security forces this year was the killing of Riyaz Naikoo, a top commander of the Hizbul, in an operation in Beighpora last month. On May 19, two top Hizbul terrorists were killed in the Safakdal area in Srinagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-forces-gun-down-three-terrorists-in-srinagar/story-yJbTAFgbcHOE9w5JDMQasL.html
21-06-2020||India||Cong seeks clarification on PM’s comment||New DelhiThe Opposition kept up pressure on the central government on Sunday over the Galwan valley clash that left 20 Indian Army soldiers dead, with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi citing a satellite image to allege that China has occupied Indian territory. “The PM had said neither anyone entered into our territory nor anyone has occupied our land. But satellite photo clearly shows that near the Pangong lake sacred land of India has been captured,” Gandhi said on Twitter. In another tweet, Gandhi, who has been unrelenting in his criticism of the government on the issue, called Prime Minister Narendra Modi “surrender Modi”.His fresh tweets came a day after the Prime Minister’s Office said there was a “mischievous interpretation” of PM Modi’s comments made at Friday’s all-party meeting, which discussed the Galwan valley skirmish.At that meeting, Modi categorically said that neither has anyone present in the Indian territory currently and nor is any Indian post captured. He also praised the valour of the 20 army personnel killed in the clash, and said they “taught a lesson” to those who were eyeing Indian territory.The PMO statement on Saturday said: “The prime minister’s observations that there was no Chinese presence on our side of the LAC (Line of Actual Control) pertained to the situation as a consequence of the bravery of our armed forces.”On Sunday, the Congress again sought a clarification from the PM in what it called contradictions in the government’s position. “Why did the PM tell the All-Party Meeting that ‘no one intruded into our territory’? Why did PMO delete these words from the official statement?” asked senior Congress spokesperson Kapil Sibal.“How were 85 jawans seriously injured and how were 10 officers and jawans captured by the Chinese? Why does the statement of the External Affairs Ministry dated June 20th, 2020, contradict the PM’s statement on incursions by the Chinese?” Sibal asked, addressing a virtual press conference.The Congress alleges that the PM’s comments are contradictory to what the defence minister and the external affairs minister have said on the issue of the Chinese trying to erect a “structure in the Galwan Valley on our side”.The Communist Party of India (Marxist), too, hit out at the government. CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said, “PM’s remarks came as a major setback to the legitimacy of the act of heroism of our brave soldiers. Further, this undermines the strength of our diplomatic efforts to resolve the dispute.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-seeks-clarification-on-pm-s-comment/story-luQbfD3tFM7xIoGhZRs4KJ.html
21-06-2020||India||US will try to help India, China, says Trump||: President Donald Trump has made yet another foray into the ongoing India-China conflict, saying the Asian neighbours are dealing with a “big problem” and the United States will try to “help them out”.Though Trump did not repeat his earlier offer of mediation, which has been firmly turned down by both India and China, he did say the United States is “talking” to them.The President, in a short reply to a reporter’s question before departing the White House for his election rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma on Saturday evening, said: “It’s a very tough situation... We’re talking to India. We’re talking to China.”He added: “They’ve got a big problem there. They’ve come to blows, and we’ll see what happens. We’ll try and help them out.”On May 29, the US President made an explicit offer of mediation and had gone on to claim that he had discussed the situation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They had not till then, but did later in a June 2 call. Trump did not pursue his offer after being turned down.Trump has been keen to intercede in that part of Asia one way or another for months now. He first offered to mediate the India-Pakistan tensions last summer in the aftermath of the Pulwama terrorist attack. Though the first offer, elicited from him by the visiting Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan, was swiftly rejected by New Delhi, the President persisted, using a range of synonyms even as the offers were firmly rejected by India.In the India-China conflict, while Trump has not clearly picked sides, his secretary of state Michael Pompeo has been explicit on who is to blame. “The PLA has escalated border tensions – we see it today in India, the world’s most popular, populous democracy,” Pompeo said, referring to the Chinese military in a virtual conference of the Copenhagen Democracy Summit on Friday.He went on to call China a “rogue actor”, not only to its Asian neighbourhood but far beyond to the rest of the world.The top American diplomat also conveyed his condolences on the killing of 20 Indian soldiers in deadly June 15 clashes that marked the first fatalities on the India-China border in 45 years. He made no mention of the Chinese casualties. The Chinese have not declared their fatalities, but they are estimated to have lost more than 40 soldiers, according to Indian officials.US lawmakers have also been clear about their view of the face-off that have been on for weeks. “I am extremely concerned by the ongoing Chinese aggression along the Line of Actual Control on the India-China border,” Eliot Engel, a Democrat who heads the powerful House foreign affairs committee, said in a statement earlier in the month. “China is demonstrating once again that it is willing to bully its neighbours rather than resolve conflicts according to international law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-will-try-to-help-india-china-says-trump/story-uvr3vBrMcabpui50567SBL.html
21-06-2020||India||Patra moves SC seeking changes in Rath Yatra order||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson, Sambit Patra approached the Supreme Court on Sunday seeking a modification of the top court’s June 18 order which had barred the annual Hindu festival of Rath Yatra at Jagannath temple in Puri this year in view of Covid-19 pandemic.Patra, who himself was hospitalized for Coronavirus symptoms and later discharged, prayed that the Rath Yatra should be allowed to be held without public participation. He submitted that the Ratha Yatra can be conducted by employing the services of Lord Jagannath’s 800 sevayats, who are persons who perform the ritual services of Lord Jagannath and other deities at the Puri Jagannath temple.In 2019, Patra had contested Lok Sabha elections from Puri and lost to Biju Janata Dal’s Pinaki Misra by 11, 714 votes.At least a dozen such applications including one by Janardhan Pattajoshi Mohapatra, who is the hereditary chief servitor of Lord Jagannatha of the Jagannatha Temple, are already pending before the apex court seeking modification of its order. These applications will be heard in chambers by a single-judge bench of justice S Ravindra Bhat at 11 am on Monday.The Rath Yatra is a festival associated with Lord Jagannatha. It was scheduled to commence this year on June 23. The festival lasts for 10 to 12 days and involves a procession of chariots containing the deities Lord Jagannatha, his brother Lord Balabhadra and sister Devi Subhadra.The Supreme Court had ordered a stay on the festival and all activities associated with it this year stating that allowing the same would lead to a congregation more than 10 lakh devotees in violation of social distancing norms which could compromise public health and safety.This order was passed in a petition filed by an NGO, Odisha Vikas Parishad which had moved the top court pointing out the public health risk involved if the annual event is allowed to take place.The NGO referred to the Tablighi Jamaat incident which was Muslim religious congregation held in mid-March at Nizamuddin area in Delhi resulting in a spurt in Covid cases across the country after people from various parts of India and even foreign countries had attended the event.“Of about 4,400 COVID-19 positive cases in India as on April 7, nearly one third were related to the religious gathering at the Markaz, Delhi. Thus, in order to avoid any similar instances of outbreak of COVID-19 cases, a religious gathering in the nature of Rath Yatra festival ought to be avoided”, the petition had stated.“Having regard to the danger presented by such a large gathering of people for the Rath Yatra, we consider it appropriate in the interests of public health and safety of citizens who are devotees to restrain the respondents (state and district authorities and managing committee of Jagannatha temple) from holding the Rath Yatra this year”, the bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde had ordered on June 18.The court had also directed that no such Rath Yatra should be allowed in any other part of Odisha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patra-moves-sc-seeking-changes-in-rath-yatra-order/story-ql1UaRbvZYi6kTqVqybE2O.html
21-06-2020||India||PM underscores yoga’s benefits amid Covid outbreak||Yoga helps boost immunity and has emerged as a force for unity that enhances the quest for a healthy planet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday, underscoring the importance of the ancient Indian practice at a time when the world is fighting the coronavirus disease.Pranayama, or breathing exercise, helps strengthen the respiratory system, which gets affected by Covid-19, Modi said in his 15-minute address on the sixth International Yoga Day.“Yoga boosts immune system of the body. You must include pranayama in your daily life... It is more relevant in the current times as it is the respiratory system of the body that is most adversely affected by Covid-19,” Modi said in his video address.Unlike previous years, there were no large gatherings to celebrate the occasion due to restrictions imposed to fight the pandemic, though several leaders and social media users posted photos and videos performing yoga.“This year’s theme is ‘Yoga at Home and Yoga with Family’. Yoga promotes family bonding as children, youngsters, elders in family come together to practise yoga; there is a flow of positive energy at home,” Modi said.He added that yoga has emerged as a force for unity and does not discriminate, as it goes beyond race, colour, gender, faith and nations.“Anybody can embrace yoga. If we can fine-tune our chords of health and hope, the day is not far away when world will witness the success of healthy and happy humanity,” he said.On December 11, 2014, the United Nations General Assembly declared June 21 as “International Day of Yoga”, approving of an idea proposed by PM Modi.Countries across the world have been celebrating the Internation Yoga Day since 2015, but this year, celebrations went digital, with the AYUSH ministry cancelling a big event planned in Leh.Modi said yoga provides not only physical strength, but also mental balance and emotional stability. “Eating the right food, playing the right sports, having right habits of sleeping and waking, and doing your work and your duties is yoga,” Modi said. “With this ‘karmayoga’, we get the solution to all the problems.”Home minister Amit Shah, too, greeted the nation on the occasion. “Yoga is much more than just a way of keeping the body healthy. It is a medium to maintain balance between body and mind, work and thoughts and also between human and nature,” he said.“Yoga is a unique gift of the Indian culture to entire humanity. The world has adopted yoga now; it received global acceptance due to the tireless efforts of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi,” he added.PC Kapoor, director, Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centre in Delhi, said: “I fully endorse what the PM has said — that breathing exercises in yoga help increase the lung capacity significantly. Almost all asanas (postures) have their benefits in terms of boosting immunity and preventing diseases...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-underscores-yoga-s-benefits-amid-covid-outbreak/story-qjavOpXQoOa9C81JRpJ8AK.html

21-06-2020||India||Maharashtra tally at 1.32 lakh with 4,000 new Covid 19 cases, numbers hide a success story||Coronavirus cases in Mumbai are advancing towards the 70,000 mark with 1,159 new cases on Sunday taking the maximum city’s tally to 66,488. The metropolitan also recorded 41 new fatalities taking the death toll to 3,671. Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, on the other hand, have surged to 1,32,075—more than double of Mumbai’s figures. The state has also registered 101 deaths in a single day, which has led to the statewide death toll climbing to 6,170, as per the health bulletin released by Maharashtra health department on Sunday.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe state has also managed to discharge 1,591 patients on Sunday after they were cured of the contagion, taking the total number of recoveries from Covid 19 to 65,744- almost half of the total number of infections recorded in the state since the outbreak. The current number of active cases under treatment stands at 60,147.On the testing front, so far 7,73,865 samples have been tested. Despite the gloomy numbers, Maharashtra does have a success story to tell.Earlier today, the Union health ministry praised the Mumbai civic body for effective containment of coronavirus in Asia’s largest slum of Dharavi. The central government credited proactive measures taken by the civic body for reducing the growth rate of the infection to 1.02 per cent in June from 12 per cent in April.The government also pointed out a steep decline of daily Covid-19 cases in Dharavi from an average of 43 a day in May to 19 a day in the third week of June.In sharp turnaround, Covid-19 growth rate dips to 1.02% in Mumbai’s Dharavi in JuneCentre’s assessment of containment strategies across the country also had a nice word for the Maharashtra government. It lauded the efforts of the Maharashtra government along with the BMC and said it had shown encouraging results.“As part of these efforts, they have actively chased the virus and aggressively conducted targeted tracing of COVID suspects,” the ministry said.Centre pointed out that Dharavi was densely populated-2,27,136 persons/sqkm—and therefore the threat of its 491 cases in April leading to a exponential spiral of cases was real but the 12% growth rate which translated into a doubling period of 18 days was reduced to a growth rate of 4.3% in May and even further to 1.02 % in June.“These measures also ensured an improved case doubling time to 43 days in May and 78 days in June,” the Centre said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-tally-at-1-32-lakh-with-4-000-new-covid-19-cases-numbers-hide-a-success-story/story-1sGfzcnNp2pdYBzzNipxsO.html
21-06-2020||India||Several MP MLAs get tested for Covid-19 after BJP legislator’s positive result||Several MLAs in Madhya Pradesh have opted for Covid-19 testing or quarantined themselves at the advice of the state assembly secretariat after a Bharatiya Janata Party legislator and his wife tested positive for the coronavirus disease, according to the secretariat officials.The test results of the MLA and his wife came late on Friday night, the day of voting in Rajya Sabha polls at the state assembly premises. The positive result caused panic among the other MLAs who were present there that day.As many as 206 legislators had participated in the voting. They included a Covid-19 positive Congress MLA who came for voting dressed in a PPE kit. Congress MLA and former minister PC Sharma said, “It was mainly BJP MLAs who were close to the infected (BJP) MLA. But we are also keeping watch on our health and have consulted doctors.”Principal secretary, Health, Faiz Ahmad Kidwai said, “The MLA himself approached a hospital to get tested along with his wife at 3.30 pm on June 19. They quarantined themselves and got the reports of tests at 10.30 pm on the day. The administration in his district was immediately informed about his health condition and a separate team was given the work of contact tracing. However, the MLA and his wife are in good health and they both are asymptomatic.”The principal secretary’s statement assumes significance after the Opposition Congress accused the BJP legislator of keeping others in the dark about his health condition, alleging he had tested positive for coronavirus two days prior to the RS poll. A state assembly official who didn’t want to be named said, “Of the 206 MLAs who cast their votes in RS poll, one was already infected with Covid-19 and the second tested positive on the very day of polling. Of the remaining MLAs , 25 are staying in MLAs rest house in Bhopal, some of them with their family members. All of these legislators, their family members and security personnel were screened on Sunday and five of them went for the tests as they had meetings with the infected MLA. Meanwhile, all the legislators across the state are being given Ayurvedic decoction for boosting their immunity.”He added, “During examination of the CCTV footage of the state assembly, four MLAs were identified who were standing close to the infected BJP MLA in the queue for casting their votes on the day of polling. These MLAs left for their home towns the next day.

21-06-2020||India||Govt seeks details from industry to curb low quality imports from China: Report||The government has sought product-wise details of cheap imports, comparison with domestic prices and tax disadvantage, if any, from industry to curb low quality inbound shipments especially from China and boost domestic manufacturing, sources said.They said a high level meeting to discuss ways to promote Atma Nirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India), including cut in import dependence from China, also took place recently in the Prime Minister’s office.Industry was asked to send comments and suggestions on certain number of goods and raw materials imported from China, which include wrist watches, wall clocks, ampoules, glass rods and tubes, hair cream, hair shampoos, face powder, eye and lip make up preparations, printing ink, paints and varnishes, and some tobacco items, one of the sources said.The other details sought include import surge data between 2014-15 and 2018-19; domestic prices of similar goods that are made here, domestic capacity, imports under free trade agreements, and inverted duty issue, if any.An industry source said that they are preparing their views on all those products and would soon send to the commerce and industry ministry.The exercise to reduce and curb imports from China assumes significance in the wake of border tensions between the two countries.China accounts for about 14 per cent of India’s imports and is a major supplier for sectors like cell phones, telecom, power, plastic toys and critical pharma ingredients.The government has recently put import restrictions on tyres, while also making its prior approval mandatory for foreign investments from countries that share land border with India to curb “opportunistic takeovers” of domestic firms, following COVID-19 pandemic, a move which will restrict FDI from China.During April 2019-February 2020, India imported goods worth USD 62.4 billion, while exports to the neighbouring country stood at USD 15.5 billion in the same period.The main goods imported from China include clocks and watches, musical instruments, toys, sports goods, furniture, mattresses, plastics, electrical machinery, electronic equipment, chemicals, iron and steel items, fertilisers, mineral fuel and metals.India has time and again raised concerns over widening trade deficit with China which stood at about USD 47 billion during April-February 2019-20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-seeks-details-from-industry-to-curb-low-quality-imports-from-china-report/story-vX25h5RP29omJ9iHairMLM.html

Among the 272 from quarantine centres who tested positive, there were 42 fire services and NDRF personnel who returned from West Bengal after Cyclone Amphan duty.The state also reported 2 more deaths taking the death toll to 14. Health department officials said till date, 5 others who tested positive for Covid-19 have died of other underlying conditions.Odisha’s breaching of the 5000-mark comes 97 days after it reported its first case on March 15, when a 33-year-old student of Bhubaneswar arrived in Odisha from Italy’s Milan after spending 9 days in Delhi. Though the number of cases did not rise much till May second week, cases galloped once the migrant workers in quarantine centres started getting tested. Since May 15, a little more than 4,400 cases have been added to the state’s Covid-19 tally in a span of just 35 days.A concerned state government announced weekend shutdowns in 11 of the districts where cases are rising, but it has not helped much. What has added to the worries of the state government is the steady rise of infection among people outside quarantine centres, indicating the onset of community transmission. While only 37 local contact cases were reported in May, at least 350 cases have been detected between June 1 and June 20.In Bhubaneswar, at least 36 cases of infection have been reported among people who were not in home or institutional quarantine. However, the state has done well on the recovery front with 72 per cent of the 5,160 cases being discharged.In Berhampur town of Ganjam district, swab samples of two journalists were sent for testing after they were found with Covid-19 symptoms during a health screening programme at City Hospital on Sunday. In a special health screening program, 26 journalists were medically screened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fears-of-community-transmission-in-odisha-as-state-count-crosses-5000-mark/story-r5DJbuRs96HEESz4r3CUBI.html
21-06-2020||India||‘It’s life for Odias’: BJP’s Sambit Patra moves SC to allow Rath Yatra, hearing tomorrow||With the world-famous Rath yatra in Puri less than 36 hours away, BJP leader Sambit Patra, who lost Lok Sabha elections from Puri last year, has joined a dozen and half other litigants in Supreme Court seeking partial modification of its June 18 stay order and allowing holding of the festival without congregation of devotees.“Today I filled an application for clarification/modification of earlier order of SC and sought permission for the Holy Rath Yatra of Shri Jagannath Mahaprabhu in Puri scheduled for 23rd June. Hope all our prayers are answered by the Lord of the Universe,” tweeted Patra after filing the intervention application.Patra said the annual Rath Yatra is not just a festival for Odia people. “It’s life for Odias. Who are we without Rath Yatra. I hope we would be blessed by Lord Jagannath tomorrow. I would go on fast on Monday and I would request everyone in Puri to go on fast tomorrow for victory in SC tomorrow,” he said.On June 18, a three-judge bench led by Chief Justice SA Bobde had stayed the Rath Yatra in view of the threat posed by the Covid-19 pandemic after an NGO moved the court against holding the festival. The SC judgment has triggered a massive outrage in Odisha with 18 intervention applications filed to modify the order. They have been listed for a hearing in the chambers of Justice S. Ravindra Bhat on Monday.As people of Odisha wait with bated breath over the scheduled hearing in SC tomorrow, Puri Shankaracharya Nischalananda Saraswati of the Govardhan Peeth alleged that there seemed to be a well-orchestrated move to stop the Rath Yatra.Also Read: Plea in SC against Rath Yatra orderIn a statement issued on Sunday, Saraswati said if the Supreme Court wanted, it could have taken up for hearing the petitions filed on June 20. “The courts do remain open even on holidays if the situation warrants. The Rath Yatra is day after tomorrow and just a day remains for the big event now. That is why one is forced to view this as a well-planned project to stop the Rath Yatra altogether. The fact that it happened just a day before the summer vacations start, also proves the same,” he said in a statement.Saraswati said in religious and spiritual matters, the supremacy of the Shankaracharya is a settled issue. “In these circumstances, the judiciary should not just get advice from us in matters of religion, but also be guided by us. I don’t want to criticise the SC, but the court did not show enough wisdom while delivering the judgment,” he said, referring to the June 18 order.Questioning the SC observation that Lord Jagannath may not forgive if the Yatra was held during the pandemic, he asked whether the Lord would forgive if all the traditions are done away with.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesEarlier on Saturday, Puri’s titular king Gajapati Dibyasingh Deb, considered as the first servitor of the Lord and also the head of the temple management committee, had written to chief minister Naveen Patnaik to hold the Rath Yatra saying not holding would hurt the religious sentiments of countless devotees around the world who watch the sacred Yatra live on TV.“In the course of Odisha’s long history, Ratha Yatra has not been held only during attacks by Mughal forces during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, when the Lords had to be hidden in remote places. The present crisis caused by Covid pandemic, is not a situation which renders it impossible to conduct Ratha Yatra in Puri as it can be held without any congregation of general public. I request you to take appropriate steps for approaching Supreme Court for a partial modification of its June 18 order so as to permit the performance of Ratha Yatra only at Puri,” wrote Divyasingh Deb in his letter to Patnaik.Among the several intervention applications filed in the SC seeking modification of the June 18 order, is one filed by Aftab Hossen, a Muslim man from Nayagarh district of Odisha. Hossen in his application said after the June 18 order, people of Odisha are feeling hurt and that the Court should allow the conduct of the yatra with participation only from servitors and temple police, without the general public playing a role in it. It is important to celebrate the festival as there is “scientific evidence” that the weather becomes pleasant when Lord Jagannath is brought out of the temple, Hossen said in his petition.The construction of the three chariots is almost over with the Maharanas working overtime to finish the work. If allowed, the nine-day festival will begin on June 23 and go on for next 10 days.Meanwhile, adding a twist to the ongoing issue, the state government on Sunday evening issued a press note saying it would take a favourable action as legally permissible when the intervention petitions are taken up for hearing before the Supreme Court on Monday.The state government said its stand during June 18 hearing was primarily related to thousands of Rath Yatras taking place all over the State. Though the press note did not mention the Rath Yatra at Puri specifically, it said the thousands of Rath Yatras across the state in almost every gram panchayats of the State would involve lakhs of people.“More than 5 lakh people of Odisha have returned to the State since May and are likely to complete their quarantine period by the end of June. This along with the onset of monsoon has made the Covid pandemic likely to peak in the State in June and July. Any congregation during the probable peaking period can lead to loss of lives and serious public health hazard,” it said.On June 18, the state government had engaged senior advocate Harish Salve who had argued from London through video conference. Officials said the state government would put its best foot forward on June 22 hearing though best possible lawyers.The Rath Yatra has continued uninterrupted since 1736. It could not take place 32 times between 1558 and 1735 due to Mughal invasions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-s-life-for-odias-bjp-s-sambit-patra-moves-sc-to-allow-rath-yatra-hearing-tomorrow/story-zPOm5cmPwWS1LSVcGHLloJ.html
21-06-2020||India||‘Inappropriate content’: Nitish Kumar writes to PM, demands censorship of streaming services||Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding that streaming services airing serials, films and movies through the internet should be brought under censorship so that viewers do not get access to “inappropriate content”.In his letter, Kumar said the streaming services have content that are not censored and subscribers easily get access to content that are high on violence, sex and obscenity that negatively impacts the minds of the viewers, especially children. He said airing of such content was not good for viewing for long duration and was already creating societal problems including crime against women and children.The chief minister also referred to the demand for ban on pornographic websites and other inappropriate content on the internet because it was adversely affecting the mental health of youths and leading to crime against women and children.“The streaming services are cheaper than Direct to Home (DTH) and cable services, a reason why it has become more popular among consumers. As there is less clarity on legal provisions binding on the content aired through streaming services, uncensored stuff is getting aired without much advertisements in such programmes,” the CM said.Kumar said the Centre must take steps to bring all programmes that are streamed under the ambit of certification as per Cinematograph Act-1962 and also make necessary legal provisions so that those making inappropriate content and airing them should be punished. “There is immediate need to categorise the production and airing of such inappropriate content through streaming services as an offence so that it could be checked. I urge the PM to look into the matter,” Kumar said in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-letter-to-pm-modi-nitish-kumar-demands-censorship-of-streaming-services/story-gCSQr8OuqUVelJJe0om6IJ.html
21-06-2020||India||YSRC MP revolts, seeks Centre’s security over threats to life from own party||YSR Congress party MP K Raghurama Krishnam Raju on Sunday revolted against his own party by lodging a complaint with Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla citing threat to life from his party’s leaders in his native district West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh.In his letter written to the Speaker on June 18, which was released to the media on Sunday, Raju requested that he be provided security by central police forces in the wake of increased threats. He also sent a copy of the letter to Union home minister Amit Shah.“I have also written separate letters to the top police officials stating that I have been receiving calls from the YSRC leaders threatening to kill me if I entered my parliamentary constituency Narasapuram. But no action was taken till date. So, I had to write to the Centre seeking security from central police forces,” Raju told Hindustan Times.He currently has a security cover of two policemen. In the letter, the MP brought to the notice of the Speaker that he had strongly objected to the recent proposal of Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams (TTD) trust board to sell a few properties of the temple, as it would hurt the sentiments of Hindu devotees of Lord Balaji.He said he could not get the appointment of chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy so that he could personally appraise him of the consequences of the decision. “I also brought to the notice of the chief minister through the media a few more issues like steep increase in the price of sand by nearly 600 per cent, which paralyzed the construction activity,” he said.Raju said following his statements, his own party MLAs from Narasapuram had started attacking him by burning his effigies and openly threatening that he would also be burnt to death if he visited his constituency.“Because of these threatening calls from YSRC MLAs and cadre without any action from the police, I am frightened to go to the constituency without protection. I felt it is not safe to move with the security provided to me by the state government with two constables. Hence, I request you to provide me with armed security,” he appealed to the Speaker.For the last few days, the Narasapuram MP had been making serious comments against the YSRC government. He alleged that caste politics had reached its peak in YSRC, while corruption and illegal sand and land sale had been rampant in the YSRC government.Raju, who previously was with the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), also said he had joined the YSRC before the 2019 general elections only after repeated requests from the party leadership. “It was because I contested from Narasapuram, the YSRC had won the seat with a slender margin. People had not voted for me on seeing Jagan’s photograph but because of my image,” he told HT.Raju alleged that the YSRC leadership had instigated attack on him from his own community (Kshatriya) leaders. “This is very bad. I request the party not to create differences within my community,” he said.Asked what his next step would be, Raju said if Jagan gave him an audience, he would meet him and explain the factual position as to how the party leaders were indulging in various irregularities and corruption. “It is up to him to take action,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ysrc-mp-revolts-seeks-centre-s-security-over-threats-to-life-from-own-party/story-yBnPIWj8xCQwSL5y8N3TnO.html

He did not utter a single word about the brutal killing of our soldiers. Even party general secretary Sitaram Yechury’s words are subdued in this regard. We want the party to explain its position,” Chennithala said.He added that the CPI(M)’s youth wing usually carries out poster wars all over the state on such issues, but it was silent this time. “It seems the party is still soft towards China. We have many examples to cite to prove this point,” he said referring to the party’s controversial position after the 1962 China attack. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has also questioned the left party’s silence over the martyrdom of Indian soldiers. “If anything happens in any part of the world, the CM reacts immediately, but this time he is totally silent. It shows the party’s true allegiance,” said BJP state president K Surendran.Amid war of words, the Congress has decided to rally behind PCC president Mullappally Ramachandran who was targeted for his controversial remarks against state health minister K K Shailaja. He had called her ‘Covid Rani’ and ‘Nipah Rajkumari’ two days ago inviting intense criticism. The CM had dubbed these remarks anti-women and questioned the Congress Party’s silence over them.“We don’t need a certificate from the CM. People know who uses the most abusive language in the state. The CM is targeting him to deflect attention from expatriates’ woes,” Chennithala said, adding more than 280 people from the state died due to covid-19 in Gulf countries but the CM was blocking their return citing lame excuses.Also Read: Playing the long game with China | OpinionThough the PCC chief’s remarks triggered a controversy, he refused to apologise saying a section of the media had twisted his words and ‘Rani’ and ‘Rajkumari’ were not derogatory terms.

Delhi had seen 3,630 cases on Saturday and 3,137 on Friday.

21-06-2020||India||Mumbai has been very kind to me, says actor Ronjini Chakraborthy||Hailing from Kolkata, actor Ronjini Chakraborthy is all happy these days -- her latest venture on OTT is getting rave reviews and ratings after all. “It feels absolutely great. When I had signed these series, I had no idea that they will garner such high viewership, though I was totally sure about the scripts and screenplay. Such a big success came as a surprise.”With films like ‘Tumbbad,’ ‘Simmba,’ Article 15 to her credit, Ronjini comes from a non film background, “Living in Kolkata, I was in love with Bollywood movies. When I decided to take up acting, my parents were pretty forthwith-- complete studies and then go ahead with films. During college, I started doing plays and then joined a theatre group. That was when I realised what real acting was. So that was the beginning for me.”Replying to the ongoing controversy of favouritism and being treated like an outsider, she says, “After studying performing arts at Film and Television Institute in Pune, I went back to Kolkata and did two films back in Bengal that gave me a small recognition and made me go to Mumbai a bit more confident. I would like to mention that the city of dreams has been kind to me. Work came my way with films like ‘From Sydney with Love,’ ‘I.D’ along with TV shows. But real recognition happened with ‘Tumbbad.’ And when once I had no work, I did the job of assistant actor for Rohit Shetty that is we used to recreated scenes for his film ‘GoImaal Returns’ before the final shoot. Side by side I continued auditioning for roles. I gave around hundred auditions then. I don’t deny that people who are from non film background have to struggle and require really good work to stand out. The expectations are too high and proving your mettle many a time is tough. Personally, I feel we should know how to deal with all this and keep ourselves steady and strong.” Ronjini shot for one of her latest series, ‘Raktanchal’ in Varanasi, “Yes it was a long stay for over four months. Varanasi exhibits outstanding energy and when I went back I actually I missed my stay there. It is a different world altogether. Also I shot for ‘Article 15’ in Lucknow and nearby cities. It is was a fun shoot. Anubhav (Sinha) sir knows the city so well and took us to all food joints where we got to eat so many delicious delicacies.”Talking about her roles in OTT series ‘Lalbazaar,’ and ‘Raktanchal’, she says, “Both my characters are completely diverse yet have similarities. While in the former, I play a sex worker based in Bengal and how she manages her tough life, in the latter, I play a woman who has her head on her shoulders and runs the show behind one of the two protagonists. Both characters gave me a variety of emotions to project.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-has-been-very-kind-to-me-says-actor-ronjini-chakraborthy/story-l2WSUmAOfcqSWQgB10iiuK.html
21-06-2020||India||After Galwan clash, states look to end contracts with Chinese firms||Many state governments are planning to cancel contracts with Chinese companies amid a growing clamour in the country to boycott Chinese products following the death of 20 Indian soldiers in a clash with PLA troops in Ladakh, officials said.On Saturday, the Haryana government annulled two tenders for installation of flue gas de-sulphurization (FGD) system at their thermal power plants at Hisar and Yamunanagar. The works under the two tenders carried a financial implication of about Rs 780 crore, Haryana government officials said, adding more contracts with Chinese firms would be cancelled in the next few days.“Uttar Pradesh will not purchase any Chinese equipment for its energy sector,” its power minister, Shrikant Sharma said.“We will see to it that even the vendors do not supply any goods that are made wholly in China or use any part of it made in China,” he said on Friday, while pointing out that Chinese firms sell cheap solar panels and other electronic goods. But UP’s minister for industrial development, Satish Mahana, cautioned on Sunday that cancelling contracts with Chinese companies can have legal implications. “Such things (cancellation of Chinese contracts) cannot happen overnight as such deals have legal issues,” he said.Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has strongly expressed his sentiments against the use of Chinese goods in wake of the standoff with China at Galwan valley even though Bihar government has not issued any specific order in this regard. “There is a need for reviewing all the previous trade agreements in a bid to ensure that Chinese products are not used,” Kumar had said at the all-party meeting called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Bihar industry minister, Shyam Rajak, said there was no role of the state government in banning Chinese products. “Any foreign firm investing in the state has to get clearances from the Centre,” he said.On Sunday, Uttarakhand instructed officials to list Chinese companies which have been given government contracts. Madan Kaushik, cabinet minister and spokesperson Uttarakhand government said that he has instructed officials to check whether the authorities in the state government have signed any contracts with Chinese authorities or companies in the past. “After we find whether there are any contracts and if there are, what sort of contracts we have, we will take a decision on whether to cancel them or not,” he said.Maharashtra government officials said the Centre will have to formulate a policy on investment by Chinese companies before states can decide.“As far as foreign direct investment (FDI) is concerned, Chinese investment is allowed in the manufacturing, service and real estate sector. If we have to ban them, then the decision has to come from the central government because we need a uniform policy and it should not happen that Chinese investment is allowed in one state and not in another,” said Bhushan Gagrani, principal secretary who is also the state coordination officer to attract investment in the state.On June 15, the state government signed 12 memorandum of understanding (MoUs) worth Rs 16,300 crore with major global companies, of them three were Chinese firms — Hengli (China), Great Wall Motors (China) and PMI Electro Mobility Solutions, a joint venture with Foton China. Six Chinese companies are involved in infrastructure projects in Mumbai with the 337-km Metro project that is estimated to cost Rs 1 lakh crore. Earlier this week, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) cancelled the bids to manufacture 10 monorail rakes received from two Chinese companies – CRRC Corporation Ltd and BYD Co Ltd. “As the two Chinese companies were dictating us to change tender conditions, MMRDA has decided to look for technology partners in India. As we do not require large quantities, it is possible for Indian firms to manufacture and supply (the coaches) in less time,” MMRDA metropolitan commissioner RA Rajeev said.Officials in several governments such as West Bengal, Odisha and Rajasthan, said no decision has been taken to ban Chinese products. “The decision to ban Chinese companies can only be taken by the Centre. Why doesn’t the BJP government snap all trade relations with China? Moreover, no Chinese company has base in West Bengal,” said Dola Sen, TMC Rajya Sabha MP and president of INTTUC, the trade union wing of the TMC.A Rajasthan government official, who was not willing to be named, said that the issue has not been discussed so far.Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh police have issued orders asking its personnel to remove Chinese apps from their phones.The Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force on Friday ordered its staffers to uninstall 52 mobile apps of Chinese origin, pointing that these applications could be used to extract information from their mobile phones and those of their family members. Amitabh Yash, Inspector General (IG) of Police of UP STF a circular had been issued to uninstall 52 Chinese applications in view of the possibility that their usage could lead to unauthorised sharing and stealing of personal data.Madhya Pradesh police on Friday issued an order instructing all officials to delete 52 Chinese apps from their mobile phones. However, DIG Harinarayanchari Mishra, in another order, on Saturday clarified that deleting the apps was an advisory and not a mandatory requirement. “Home ministry released lists of different apps from time to time to alert people that their personal data could be compromised on their mobile phones and could be stolen through these apps,” Mishra said in the order.Protests have been reported from various parts of the country demanding ban on Chinese products. Former RJD MP and chief of Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) Rajiv Ranjan had taken to streets in Patna on Thursday by blackening a hoarding of a Chinese mobile phone company and also exhorted shopkeepers not to sell Chinese goods. In some places, shopkeepers and residents have also burnt Chinese products to protest the Galwan valley clash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-galwan-clash-states-look-to-end-contracts-with-chinese-firms/story-aJVHNdgn63Gyb6BLLhOD2I.html
21-06-2020||India||‘Well orchestrated plan to stall Rath Yatra’: Puri Shankaracharya||Puri Shankaracharya Swami Nischalananda Saraswati has alleged presence of a “well-orchestrated plan” to stall the world famous Puri Rath Yatra this year using coronavirus pandemic as a ruse, even as attempts to get the Supreme Court to allow the age old ritual to take place on June 23 continues, reported PTI.BJP leader Sambit Patra is the latest to move the Supreme Court seeking permission to hold the Jagannath Yatra. His petition offers an assurance that congregation of devotees will not be allowed during the procession mitigating the risk of spreading coronavirus.The Supreme Court had stayed the holding of the yatra for the first time in over two centuries over fears that congregation of lakhs of devotees during on the occasion could prove to be a fertile ground for spreading Covid-19 infection.However, after the decision led to an outrage in Odisha, several petitions were filed requesting the court to reconsider its decision. On Saturday, Puri king Gajapati Dibyasingh Deb, who heads the management of the 12th century Jagannath temple, had requested Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik to approach the Supreme Court with a request for partial modification of its order and to allow the Rath Yatra only at Puri.Also Read: Puri King asks Naveen Patnaik to move SC to modify order stopping Rath Yatra“The cancellation of Rath Yatra is not correct. SC can allow the deities to get on the chariots. However, the congregation of the devotees should be banned and the festival be organised with limited servitors and police. The festival can be telecast live,” Saraswati had said a day after the SC judgement.A three-judge bench, headed by chief justice SA Bobde, had stayed the Rath Yatra on Thursday, a decision accepted by the state cabinet and rejected by various religious bodies. At least 4 intervention petitions have been filed in the matter. Chhatisa Nijoga, the apex body of priests of the Jagannath temple has filed two intervention petitions seeking recall of the order and allowing Rath Yatra at Puri to be held while adhering to all guidelines of Covid-19.Also Read:Plea in SC against Rath Yatra orderAmong the arguments presented to allow the Rath Yatra, the petitioners allege that it is a unique festival with an unbroken tradition for over 280 years. Another argument cites a 1964 order by the Supreme Court which allegedly termed the Puri Rath Yatra to be a unique event which “requires special treatment” by the state government. Another point seeks to highlight the huge expenses incurred in the preparation for the Yatra including construction of the chariots and Covid-19 testing of hundreds of servitors to seek its restoration.Petitions also mention an alternative way of holding the yatra sans the crowd of devotees by using the police force to pull the chariots while another suggests using either machinery or elephants for the purpose.Temple priests and other religious bodies in favour of holding the yatra had accused the Naveen Patnaik government for allegedly not presenting a convincing argument in the Supreme Court for holding the Yatra, with some even alleging that it was a deliberate tactic to stall the Yatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/well-orchestrated-plan-to-stall-rath-yatra-puri-shankaracharya/story-1kgO7q2gg9UgaCy1pukIEO.html

A large number of people had gathered at these places to see the eclipse that happened after a gap of 14 years.The eclipse was to be clearly visible in Suratgarh in Rajasthan, Sirsa and Kurukshetra in Haryana, Dehradun, Uttarakhand and in Tapovan in Himachal. But it could not be seen in most places due to cloudy weather.In Nainital’s Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) where scientists had made arrangements for live streaming of the eclipse, weather played a spoilsport. Wahab Uddin, senior scientist at ARIES said clouds cleared briefly around 12.10 pm and people could see the eclipse through live streaming on YouTube. “Had weather been good, we would have witnessed a good crowd,” he said.In most parts of Uttarakhand, temples were shut during the eclipse period and people were seen taking dips in nearby rivers post-eclipse. “We witnessed very few customers during the eclipse. People came out after the eclipse,” said Amit Narang, a shopkeeper from Kumaon.In Haridwar, shrines, temples, mutts remained closed for almost 15 hours and the famous Ganga puja was not performed in the morning because the eclipse is considered inauspicious. After the solar eclipse got over at 2:51 pm, temples were cleaned and Ganga water was sprinkled amidst special chanting of hymns by priests.In Madhya Pradesh, people watched the solar eclipse in groups while maintaining social distance.“It was a great experience to watch the ring of fire very clearly amid clouds. I made all types of arrangements including spectacles and a telescope so that common people could enjoy the moment. Spectacles were not allowed to be exchanged with others due to Covid-19 situation but the telescope was sanitised properly,” said a science activist Sarika Gharu. A banker Ashok Singh from Gwalior said, “It is for the first time I saw a solar eclipse and I got enthralled while watching the moon covering the sun.” Sandhya Kesari, a housewife from Bhopal said, “I was hesitant to see the solar eclipse with naked eyes. However, I saw it for a few seconds, though not looking directly at the Sun. It was an amazing experience.” At Birla Planetarium in Kolkata, there was a huge crowd of people to watch the eclipse, especially students and astronomy enthusiasts. “This was one of those moments for which people have to wait for years,” said Debiprasad Duari, director, M P Birla Planetarium. The eclipse was recorded and streamed online by Birla Industrial and Technological Museum in south Kolkata. Science clubs in several districts arranged viewing sessions for its members. “I wish the sky was clear. We could have had a full view of the eclipse,” said Ananta Majumdar, a star gazer from Bhawanipore.In Rajasthan, astronomers and a large number of media persons assembled in Patroda village of Sriganganagar where the solar eclipse was said to have been viewed best. A student of astronomy present there said the sun was 99% covered around 11.50 am in a strip of 2 0km between Ghadsana and Anupgarh. Anupgarh MLA Santosh Bawri made arrangements for people to view the rare celestial event. In Jaipur, people who went to Birla planetarium to see the eclipse, had to return disappointed because it was closed. Later, some media crews were allowed in the planetarium.

21-06-2020||India||‘How did 20 soldiers die if no one entered Indian territory?’: Congress asks PM Modi||Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Sunday posed five questions for the Centre to answer on government’s position on the Indo-China border conflict over the past 6 weeks that peaked with a deadly clash in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley along the LAC on June 15, resulting in 20 casualties among Indian Army soldiers and an unverified number of deaths on the Chinese side .Among other questions, Sibal alleged that the government was in denial of Chinese “intrusions” as “confirmed” by army generals and satellite imagery and sought to know the reason for the denials.“Despite statements of experts, army generals & satellite imagery depicting Chinese intrusion into Pangong Tso Lake up to 8 kms, construction of 60 permanent structures & occupation up to Finger4, why is the Govt denying Chinese transgression?,” Sibal asked in of the five questions.Also read: In fresh jibe at PM Modi on India-China face-off, Rahul Gandhi again accuses govt of surrendering Indian territorySibal’s question alleging India was in denial of Chinese transgressions come a day after the government issued a clarification on the controversy and said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s assertion that “no one has entered our territory, no one is at present within our territory and no one has occupied our posts”, referred to the situation after Indian Army’s brave action to thwart Chinese attempts to erect a structure on the Indian side of the LAC on June 15. The government’s clarification was necessitated after some commentators in general and opposition leaders in particular claimed that PM’s above mentioned statement, given during the all party meet called on the issue, amounted to a “surrender” to China and was tantamount to “appeasement” of the communist country’s leadership. Sibal said several security experts, retired army generals and veterans, along with satellite imagery have spoken about Chinese-designed incursions into our territories along the LAC. He also cited statements made by the defence and external affairs minister along with statements by the external affairs ministry on June 17 and 20, to say that government had itself referred to the Chinese incursions on multiple occasions between April-May 2020 till date in Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso Lake Area and Hot Springs. Sibal said that the government should not even appear to have ceded any part of these territories to the Chinese.Also read | ‘No restrictions on using firearms’: India gives soldiers freedom along LAC in extraordinary times“Until the Chinese retreat and status quo ante is restored, our Government should not let up or appear to cede any part of these territories to the Chinese,” he said, before adding that China’s “brazen transgressions” into India’s territory cannot be accepted and India’s territorial integrity cannot be allowed to be compromised in any circumstances.In one of his other four questions directed at the government and the prime minister, Sibal asked, “Isn’t the statement of the PM an affront to the valour & supreme sacrifice of Col B.Santosh Babu and 19 Jawans who sought to evict the Chinese from our territory in Galwan Valley? Does the Govt mean that their sacrifice was in vain?”In his next question he wanted to know why China had now advanced its claim on the Galwan Valley after having never made a similar claim in the past.“Is it not correct that China has never claimed Galwan Valley as its territory? Is it also not correct that China has now committed brazen transgressions into Galwan Valley,” Sibal askedIn his penultimate question, he wanted to know from PM Modi that if no one entered Indian territory, then how did India’s 20 soldiers die?“Why did the PM tell the All-Party Meeting that “no one intruded into our territory”? Why did PMO delete these words from the official statement? And if ‘no one intruded into our territory’, how did our 20 soldiers die?” he asked.The government’s clarification on the matter had answered some of these issues on Saturday and said that the PM statement was being misinterpreted and that it didn’t amount to a denial of Chinese incursions. It also referred to MEA’s statements over the past few days accusing China of attempting to change the status quo at the LAC as the primary cause for the violent clash between soldiers of the two sides.Also Read: ‘Ladakh face-off a turning point, India will have to change its China policy’: General VP MalikSibal’s last question wanted to know the reason for an alleged “contradiction” between PM Modi and external affairs ministry’s statement dated June 20.Kapil Sibal also asked the prime minister why US president Donald Trump had not come out in India’s support despite the friendship the PM enjoys with the US president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kapil-sibal-has-5-questions-for-the-centre-on-pm-modi-s-statement-on-galwan-valley-clash-with-china/story-RID8oqaAWJHTeyzbHTC5jK.html
21-06-2020||India||Include Chhattisgarh in Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan: CM Baghel to PM Modi||Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has demanded that the Centre includes all of the state’s districts in the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan.Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Rs 50,000 crore central rural employment generation scheme on Saturday. It is aimed at creating livelihoods for thousands of jobless migrant workers who moved back from the cities to their home villages during the lockdown imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The scheme will cover 116 districts across six states – Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan , Jharkhand and Odisha -and offers 125 days of employment.In a letter written to the prime minister, Bhupesh Baghel said that even though Chhattisgarh’s neighbouring states ( MP, Jharkhand and Odisha) have been included in the scheme, his state has been excluded despite having similarities in terms of geographical, economical and social scenario with these states.“The states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Orissa have been included but Chhattisgarh has not been included in the scheme. By incorporating all the districts of Chhattisgarh, all the migrant labourers of the state will get employment and self-employment opportunities according to their interest and skills for earning,” he stated.The chief minister further said that the entire nation is badly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Labourers, who earn their livelihood on a day-to-day basis, are the most affected due to the crisis. Migrant labourers have returned to their home states as employment avenues have shut down in places where they had gone for jobs. So far, over 5 lakh migrant labourers have returned to Chhattisgarh and the number is still increasing.He further wrote that about three-fourths of the state is extremely backward.“About 90 per cent of the total population of Chhattisgarh depends on agriculture and labour work for livelihood comprising unorganised sector, agricultural labourers and marginalised farmers. Bastar and Sarguja division of Chhattisgarh are tribal-dominated and there are also 10 aspirational districts in the state,” CM said in his letter.The Chief Minister requested that all the districts of Chhattisgarh be immediately included in the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan to facilitate employment and self-employment of all migrant labourers of the state may have opportunities to earn a living according to their interest and skills.Bhupesh Baghel has been writing letters to central ministers and the prime minister in the last couple of months related to the Covid-19 pandemic.Last week, he wrote to Union Minister for Road Transport & Highways, Nitin Gadkari, urging him to expedite the tardy construction work of national highways (NH) that pass through the state and convert some state highways into NH.He also wrote to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, asking the Centre to allow state governments to avail the additional borrowing limit of 2% and enhance their resources during the Covid-19 crisis without any conditions.Last month during the nationwide lockdown, the CM had written a letter to PM Modi in which he had suggested that state governments should be entitled to decide which areas should be kept under three zones- Red, Orange and Green – which, at that time, were being classified by the central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/include-chhattisgarh-in-garib-kalyan-rozgar-abhiyan-cm-baghel-to-pm-modi/story-B4KPcYSunBC6uUFElQG1DP.html

Many injuries resurface due to this torture. There was formation of pus and swelling in my eyes and brain. I have blurred vision in the right eye and I cant see at all from the left one,” she said, apparently referring to her imprisonment in the 2008 Malegaon blast case.Asked about her posters appearing in Bhopal claiming she was ‘missing’ during the coronavirus outbreak, Thakur said she could not return to Bhopal from Delhi earlier because of travel restrictions due the lockdown.Thakur said she along with her staff and security could not get tickets on time due to the travel restrictions.Congress MLA and former state minister P C Sharma claimed that Thakur was in Bhopal when the lockdown began and left for Delhi later for treatment of a small ailment.Talking to PTI, Sharma also rubbished her claim that she was tortured under the Congress regime.“We respect women. How can the Congress torture her when there was a BJP government for 15 years in Madhya Pradesh and six years at the Centre? These allegations are aimed at creating confusion,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lost-vision-in-one-eye-suffered-torture-due-to-congress-pragya-thakur/story-TpXErYIeX6mgzcvF1otITI.html
21-06-2020||India||CRPF personnel in Jharkhand booked for allegedly beating villagers in anti-Maoist ops||The Jharkhand police have lodged an FIR against a group CRPF jawans for allegedly beating up seven people in a remote village in West Singhbhum district during a patrol.The FIR was registered in Goilkera police station on June 17 after villagers of Anjadbera complained of atrocities on June 15, police said on Sunday. The villagers were, are also demanding that that offences under the Scheduled Tribes Act and looting be added in the FIR against the jawans. Villagers have accused the CRPF jawans of looting of Rs 35, 000 cash, damaging their food-grain and other valuables.“We have lodged FIR under sections 323, 324 and 341 of IPC against CRPF jawans on the basis of complaint by Anjadbera villagers on June 16. Prima facie, it appears that some of the jawans have failed to handle the situation professionally. We are identifying the jawans and action as per law will be taken. CRPF has also filed a complaint against few villagers on the basis of interception of messages showing that some villagers were leaking information to the CPI (Maoist) about movement of forces,” Indrajit Mahatha, West Singhbhum superintendent of police (SP), said on Sunday.The CRPF could not be contacted for comments.According to the police and the CRPF, intercepted messages indicated that two dreaded Maoist commanders - politburo and central committee members -Prashant Bose alias Kishan-da and Misir Besra alias Sagar-da, both carrying reward of Rs 1 crore on their heads, have been camping in Sarjambudu forests and hills, adjacent to Anjdbeda, Chiriyabera and many other villages around under Goilkera, Sonua, Bandgaon, Gudri police station areas.A fact finding committee from Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha (JJM) comprising its members Manki Tubid and Kamalesh Purty has found 11 villagers were brutally beaten up by CRPF jawans of which seven sustained serious injuries and three were critically injured. On Sunday, they tweeted the committee’s report to Jharkhand chief minister (CM) Hemant Soren demanding action under ST Act.“Two of the injured villagers – one with a broken leg and the other with head injury – are still in hospital while the rest nine have been discharged after treatment. The villagers told us that 200-250 CRPF jawans had come to the Anjadbera village on June 15 afternoon when they were putting the roofs of their thatched houses. Jawans were asking about Maoists but were speaking in Hindi while the villagers only understood and spoke Ho language, leading to a communication gap. Later, 20-25 CRPF jawans took about a dozen villagers to an under-construction house and beat them up,” Manki Tubid said on Sunday.He said the incident came to light after a teacher phoned them in Chaibasa. “This teacher is the only man in the village with a mobile phone and can be connected only under the lone mobile tower in some distance,” Tubid said. The village has 125 people. The CRPF in its counter-complaint said four village youths started fleeing and when caught they got into a scuffle with the jawans. The CRPF troopers have has also seized Maoist pamphlets from their houses.Forces had entered the inaccessible Anjadbra and Chiriyabera villages after one and half years. Located 23 km from Chaibasa, the village has no electricity, piped drinking water and children don’t study there as the only primary school is 6 km away.The SP said they have not yet turned the CRPF complaint into an FIR but police were investing the same. “Maoists led by Prashant Bose and Misir Besra have now shifted their Eastern Regional Bureau (ERB) to Sarjamburu from Naxal hotbed Sranda forests. We have definite information that Maoists are working to turn the area into a positional warfare zone (PWZ) like they did in Bastar. Naxals don’t want police or security forces in the villages and have been exploiting them by threats and other means, using them for propaganda, forcing them to pass on information etc. They are even forcibly training village men, women and children,” said Mahatha.Sinu Cundi, a villager who was allegedly beaten up said the jawans asked them to come down from their house roofs but they could not understand. “We came down after seeing their hand gestures and they kept on asking where the Maoists were. They started beating me when I said I don’t know anything about Maoists,” said Sundi.Ram Surin said when he returned home after fishing in the river he saw his son with multiple injuries, even unable to speak. “When I entered my house I found it ransacked, Rs 35, 000 aadhaar cards, land records (khatiyan) everything gone and food-grain splattered away,” said Surin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crpf-personnel-in-jharkhand-booked-for-allegedly-beating-villagers-in-anti-maoist-ops/story-SFvSyqJvlrZ72joB3lYwZL.html
21-06-2020||India||How the Bihar Regiment removed the Chinese observation post from PP-14 in Galwan valley||On the evening of June 15, the Indian 3 Infantry Division Commander with other senior officers was at an Indian post near the Y junction of Shyok and Galwan rivers in the eastern Ladakh sector as talks were to be held between the two countries.The Indian security forces including the 16 Bihar Regiment were asked to ensure that the post was removed by the Chinese after which a small patrol was sent to convey the message, sources told ANI.The Chinese observation post was manned by 10-12 soldiers who were told by the Indian patrol to go away from there as was agreed upon in the senior level military talks between the two armies. The Chinese refused to do so even as the Indian patrol returned to their unit to inform them about the development.This was when the Indian troops with around 50 people and 16 Bihar Commanding Officer Colonel Santosh Babu in the lead, went on to tell the Chinese to go back further in their territory as they were on Indian soil.Meanwhile, by the time the first Indian patrol returned from the site, the Chinese had called for reinforcements from their rear positions in the Galwan river valley who came with around 300-350 people.As the Indian patrol reached, the sources said, the Chinese had already built up troops on higher ground around the observation post and kept the stones and weapons ready for launching an attack on the Indian troops.As the two sides started talking, the discussion turned into a heated one and the Indian side started uprooting their tents and equipment. The Chinese, who had already prepared themselves for aggression against Indian troops, attacked the Indian side in which their first attack was on the 16 Bihar CO and Havildar Palani. After the CO went down, the Biharis lost control and started attacking the Chinese ferociously despite being heavily outnumbered and stones raining from the higher ground.The fight went on for over three hours till late in the night in which several Chinese troops were either dead or injured seriously.Next morning, when the situation calmed down relatively, the dead bodies of the Chinese troops were lying in the open and was handed over to them by Indian troops, sources said.A total of around 100 troops took part in the operations from the Indian side while the Chinese had over 350 people on the location.However, the Bihari troops had managed to uproot the Chinese position there at the Patrolling Point 14.Soon after the incident, the Chinese reinforced their positions near that location and have their offensive forces ready in the rear locations.Sources said that even though outnumbered, the Biharis managed to remove the Chinese post which was existing there in violation of the agreements between the two sides.Now the Indian and Chinese Lieutenant General level talks are being planned in the next few days in the Eastern Ladakh area to defuse the situation further on PP-14, PP-15 and PP-17A.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-the-bihar-regiment-removed-the-chinese-observation-post-from-pp-14-in-galwan-valley/story-LFnWgI7olCT4xfYBuug4UN.html

21-06-2020||India||Nepalese FM radio stations start giving weather bulletins of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura||After Nepal’s parliament endorsed the political map that shows the disputed areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of its territory earlier this month, some Nepalese FM radio stations close to India-Nepal border in Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh have started giving weather bulletins of these three areas.These FM radio stations are located in Darchula district of Nepal and can be heard in the bordering areas of Dharchula, Baluakot, Jauljibi and Kalika towns on the Indian side in Pithoragarh, according to locals.Krishna Garbiyal, a prominent leader of the Rung community in Dharchula said these Nepalese FM stations have started giving information on weather reports of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura considering these areas as their own territories, like India, did recently with PoK.Also read: Not just India’s Galwan, China has a long list of territorial disputesIn the first week of May, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) had started including cities like Muzaffarabad and Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in its weather forecasts, stating PoK was part of India.Locals living in the bordering areas, especially in Dharchula, said that Nepalese FM channels have unleashed propaganda in between songs by including speeches of Nepali politicians and leaders regarding these areas belonging to Nepal.People in Dharchula confirmed that after India inaugurated the road till Lipulekh Pass - the traditional trading route with Tibet - Nepalese FM channels have started playing speeches in between Nepalese songs.“As Nepalese songs are listened by villagers on both sides of the border, these anti-India speeches, delivered by Nepalese leaders from time to time affect the psyche of people living on both sides of the border and are fuelling seeds of disharmony in the relations between the people on the two sides,” said Shalu Dayal, a resident of Dantu village of Dharchula.Dayal claimed that besides some of these FM stations playing anti-India speeches in between Nepalese songs, some old FM channels and websites on the Nepalese side were also highlighting reports of Kalapani being part of Nepal.Ashok Nabiyal, a social activist from Dharchula’s Vyans Valley said Indian intelligence agencies active at India-Nepal border need to take cognisance of this propaganda so as to counter these anti- India speeches in these bordering areas. “Nepalese propaganda is clearly aimed at influencing locals on this side of the border and strengthening their claims, but our authorities are yet to take any pro-active measure to counter this propaganda and misinformation,” he said.The local authorities in the district said they are yet to get information about these developments“We do not have any such information neither our intelligence units have given us any feedback on this issue,” said Preeti Priya Darshani, superintendent of police (SP) Pithoragarh.Dharchula circle officer VK Acharya said, “none of our intelligence units have given us any information regarding anti-India propaganda in Dharchula’s bordering areas recently”.Nepal claiming Indian territories in its map has disturbed traditional relations between people of Nepal and Uttarakhand in the bordering regions of the state. Locals, officials and experts have rubbished the Nepalese claim. Even as there have been good relations between the Nepalese and the people living in border areas on this side, Nepal’s recent claims have not gone well with the people.Nrip Singh Napachayal, former Uttarakhand chief secretary, who hails from Pithoragarh’s Rung community said Nepal has erroneously shown Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as their territory and was unleashing misinformation through its communication mediums.“These actions of Nepalese have disturbed the traditional relations between the people on the two sides, which have much in common linguistically and culturally. Traditionally and historically, Kalapani has always been venerated as a sacred source of Kali river, while river Mangti has always been regarded as the sacred river of the tribal community living here,” he said.The Kali River originates at Kalapani at an altitude of 3,600 metres and flows southwards. Named after Goddess Kali, whose temple is situated in Kalapani area near the Lipulekh pass at the border between India and China, the river’s upper course forms India’s continuous eastern boundary with Nepal.“Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura are part of the Indian border with China and they have no relation with Nepal border. Lipulekh Pass has served as the entrance of Indian traders and Kailash Mansarovar pilgrims, which has never been objected by any ruler of Nepal till now. These claims are surprising and can vitiate the harmony between the people on two sides of the border who have been living in this region for thousands of years in peace and harmony,” he said.Uttarakhand’s noted historian Ajay Singh Rawat said historically Indian tribal people of Vyans valley have been doing trade with Tibet from Lipulekh pass from 6th century.“There is no evidence when Nepalese traders have carried out the trade from Lipulekh pass. The Kailash Mansarovar yatra by Indian pilgrims has also been going on traditionally from the same pass from centuries without any objection from the rulers of Nepal,” said Rawat.“Even the British travellers to Tibet before independence and Indian scholars on Kailash Mansarovar have pointed out Kalapani as the origin of river Kali also called Mahakali in Nepal and Sharda in Pithoragarh. “Charles A Sheering, British traveller and administrator, who visited Tibet in 1905, has written in his book that Kalapani is considered as the original source of Kali river... there are more than half a dozen small springs which all combine and form the source of River Kali,” said Rawat.Citing historical records, Dr Rawat said that immediately after the Sugauli Treaty, landlords of Vyans valley in the present Dharchula area had moved an application in the court of the then commissioner of Kumaon in March 1817, saying that after the treaty only two villages - Tinkar and Changru - had gone to Nepal side while 6 other villages of the valley had remained within the Indian territory. “Since then, all 6 villages are within the Indian territory,” said Rawat.On June 18, Nepal’s parliament passed a constitutional amendment under which it unanimously voted to endorse the new political map issued last month that shows the disputed areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepal. The border row escalated last month after India opened an 80-kilometre-long road to Lipulekh on the border with the Tibet Autonomous Region to facilitate pilgrims going to Kailash Mansarovar. The Indian side maintains that Nepal’s shifting claims are contrary to the Treaty of Sugauli signed in 1815 by Nepal and the British.The Treaty of Sugauli between the British and Nepal was signed in December 1815 and ratified in March 1816. It defined river Kali as the western border of Nepal. India asserts that the river begins in Kalapani as this is where all its tributaries merge, but Nepal claims that the river begins from Lipulekh Pass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepalese-fm-radio-stations-broadcast-propaganda-to-back-kathmandu-s-claim-on-lipulekh-kalapani-and-limpiyadhura/story-UCzxyZb5yY7JFe1ZAx7ybI.html
21-06-2020||India||Chhattisgarh govt red flags coal block auction in biodiversity-rich forests||The Chhattisgarh government has asked the Centre not to allow auction of coal blocks which fall under Hasdeo Arand, Lemru elephant reserve and the Mand river catchment area which are biodiversity-rich forests.Five of the nine coal blocks that will be up for auction for commercial mining fall under this area which includes Morga -2, Morga (South), Madanpur north, Shyang and Fathehpur (east).In a letter to Union Minister of Environment Forest and Climate Change, Prakash Javadekar on Saturday, Chhattisgarh Forest minister Mohammad Akbar said that many public and private sector industries are currently engaged in coal mining in Chhattisgarh.“Coal block between Hasdev Arand and Mand river area also proposed for auction by the Union government …. Recently, there has been an increase in the numbers of wild elephants in the state which has led to a spike in human-elephant conflict. For providing habitat for wild elephants, 1,995 sq km of forest area around Hasdeo river has been declared as Lemru elephant reserve. The process of issuing notification for the same is under process,” Akbar said in the letter.He reasoned that it is necessary to stop mining in that region to prevent loss of human lives and control on man-elephant conflict.“It is my humble request to you, that in the upcoming coal block auction, the Hasdev Aranya and its adjacent Mand river coal blocks located in the catchment area and areas within the range of the proposed elephant reserve should not be included in the auction,” Akbar wrote.A senior officer said that apart from five coal blocks which fall under this area, the government has no opposition in auctioning other four other mines.“The other mines fall in areas which are not in Hasdeo Arand and catchment area , hence there is no issue in auctioning those,” said a senior forest official.Hasdeo Arand spans 170,000 hectares of forests.The other four coal blocks are -- Gare Palema (4/1), Gare Palema (4/7), Shankarpur Bhatgaon (second extension) and Sondhia. The officer said Chhattisgarh has not yet decided to approach the Supreme Court on the issue.“We have not decided to move the Supreme Court like Jharkhand till now,” said the officer.On Saturday, the Jharkhand government moved the Supreme Court challenging the Centre’s decision to auction coal blocks for commercial mining.Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren said the coal auction it is a huge policy decision and the respective state governments needed to be taken into confidenceThe Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan, which is working for rights of tribals in Hasdeo Arand region accused the Centre of ignoring environmental concerns while deciding on the coal blocks to be auctioned.“We welcome the letter written by the Chhattisgarh government. It is clear that in the auction process of coal block, the Modi government has not only ignored the environmental concerns but the opposition of gram sabhas was also not taken into consideration. This auction is also an attack on the federal structure because the centralization of the entire process has taken away the rights of the states,” said Alok Shukla, convener of Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan.Meanwhile, Chhattisgarh government is considering increasing the area of Lemru elephant reserve area after activists demanded the inclusion of the total catchment area of Hasdeo river in the reserve.Forest department sources said that the final decision has to be taken by the Chief Minister but total area of the reserve which is about 1995.48 square kilometers could be extended.The government might include the total or a part of the catchment area of Hasdeo Basin, which is about 250 square kilometers with the elephant reserve. The major hurdle in front of the government is four operational mines, five allotted mines and 12 coal reserves which come under the catchment area of Hasdeo Basin.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday launched the auction of 41 coal mines for commercial mining, saying the market for the commodity is now open and the sales will help turn the Covid-19 crisis into an opportunity.But several of the 41 mines are located in biodiversity-rich forest areas in central India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-govt-red-flags-coal-block-auction-in-biodiversity-rich-forests/story-YINHJI2SkrIUXQAwfgaGvM.html
21-06-2020||India||Tug of war between Centre and Chhattisgarh; NIA says state can’t probe 2013 Jheerum Ghati attack, approaches court||An all-out war has erupted between the Centre and Chhattisgarh government over a fresh case registered by the state police last month in connection with the Jheerum Ghati ambush seven years ago. Twenty-seven people, including senior Congress leaders Nand Kumar Patel, Mahendra Karma, Dinesh Patel and VC Shukla, were killed by a group of 150 Maoists in that attack in 2013.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) wrote to Chhattisgarh police last week asking them not to proceed with the investigation in the first information report (FIR) registered by Bastar Police on May 26, saying it is already investigating the case. The ministry of home affairs (MHA) too has opined that since both the FIRs (registered on May 25, 2013, and May 26, 2020) relate to the same incident, NIA has the powers to take over the fresh FIR too. The federal anti-terror probe agency even approached a special court in Jadgalpur on June 16, saying Chhattisgarh police would be violating Section 6 of the NIA act, which specifically prohibits the state government to proceed with the investigation once the case is entrusted to it. In his letter to Bastar’s superintendent of police on June 10, NIA’s chief investigating officer in the Jheerum Ghati attack case, Amit Singh, has asked to transfer all May 26, 2020, FIR related documents and not to proceed further with the investigation as “it may lead to vexatious and avoidable litigation due to conflict of jurisdiction”. Singh said that a charge sheet has already been filed against nine accused in September 2015 in the case while searches are being carried out for arresting 25 more accused and the trial too is at an advanced stage.HT has reviewed NIA’s letter to Bastar’s SP, its petition in the court and MHA’s opinion. NIA informed the special court last week that “the contents of FIR (registered by Bastar Police on May 26, 2020) fall in the definition of a terrorist act as well as in the ambit of scheduled offence prescribed in the NIA Act, 2008” while urging it to give directions to state police not to pursue it. On the other hand, the Chhattisgarh government is in no mood to hand over the probe to the central agency. The state government has, over past couple of years, repeatedly questioned NIA’s credibility saying it didn’t probe the conspiracy angle. Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel has said on numerous occasions that the Centre is not allowing a thorough probe by the state government by refusing to transfer the NIA case to it. In fact, the Baghel government moved the Supreme Court in January this year challenging the constitutionality of the NIA act saying it takes away the powers of states to investigate crimes as enshrined in the constitution.Chairman of Chhattisgarh Congress communications department – Shailesh Nitin Trivedi said – “We have been saying from day one that it was a political criminal conspiracy, which NIA has failed to unearth. We will do everything to find out what exactly happened in that in 2013 incident in which our beloved Congress leaders were brutally murdered by Naxals. Why is Centre not investigating the larger conspiracy angle?”.Trivedi said they will contest NIA’s claim in the court and before the public. NIA is currently empowered to take over any case in states without their consent. Chhattisgarh is the first state ever to challenge the entire NIA act. The NIA didn’t respond to phone calls or SMS query. “We are taking legal opinion on NIA’s plea after which a decision will be taken,” Sundarraj P, Bastar’s inspector general of police, said while speaking to HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tug-of-war-between-centre-and-chhattisgarh-nia-says-state-can-t-probe-2013-jheerum-ghati-attack-approaches-court/story-fXPA2vIF1UqKc2fR5Q0LRI.html

Prior to the murder, Haldar did not have any criminal record and used to drive taxis for a living.While it is possible to make a single-shot pistol that Haldar came up with, even criminals who make improvised firearms on a commercial scale cannot manufacture ammunition because the technology is too sophisticated, investigating officials said. The accused watched videos on the internet to make the pistol and ammunition, said Murli Dhar Sharma, joint commissioner of police (crime).Also read: Sky gazers in Kolkata gather on rooftops to witness solar eclipseThe accused stabbed the victim as he was not sure if the improvised ammunition was powerful enough to kill her, said officials probing the case.Haldar murdered 20-year-old Priyanka Purkait at her residence at Anandapally West in the Regent Park area. Haldar allegedly shot the victim and then stabbed her in the neck when she was sleeping in her bedroom.“After his arrest, Haldar said during interrogation that Priyanka wanted to get out of the relationship but Hadar, who is married, would not let her,” an investigating officer said on the condition of anonymity. “He dumped the pistol in a hydrant,” the officer added.The officers were stunned when Haldar confessed that he made the pistol and the ammunition at home by procuring commonly available components from shops and some friends. Haldar fled after the crime. The victim was declared dead on arrival at a local hospital. Her relatives told the police that Haldar had threatened to kill her around a month ago but they did not think that he was capable of committing murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-driver-who-murdered-girlfriend-made-pistol-ammunition-watching-internet-videos/story-IimNIzYVrNAjzMgnBCYEmO.html

It’s not technically possible to close the wells immediately as it will affect reservoirs. Many industries are dependent on the OIL for their operations. We are also considering a legal option for a stay on the closure order,” said Hazarika.There are 17 oil wells and 5 gas wells in the Baghjan oil field. A preliminary report on the environmental damage caused due to the Oil India Limited’s gas well blowout found oil has leaked into the mainstream of river Lohit polluting the water and adjoining Maguri-Motapung wetland with toxic pollutants.The report by Wildlife Institute of India drafted earlier this month has recommended that the approved new wells and exploration in the area should be put on hold until the OIL has disaster handling capabilities in place.“The toxic fumes and oil coating has universally affected flora and fauna. The contaminants and oil is continuing to be released in the surrounding areas and immediate steps are needed to contain this spillover. The toxins released are known to have long-term persistence in soils and sediments, which will not only affect current life conditions but, due to sustained release over a long period, pose a serious health risk for a long term,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baghjan-oil-field-was-operating-without-assam-pollution-control-board-s-nod-says-closure-order/story-Yuq8xM8lEPHj0T33EaA6rN.html
21-06-2020||India||Newlywed brides fought in battle of Haldighati, says Rajasthan textbook||Newlywed brides fought in the battle of Haldighati wearing men’s dresses as part of Mewar king Maharana Pratap’s army against Mughal emperor Akbar, according to a new history book for Class 10 students.The book – Rajasthan Ka Itihas & Sanskrati – available for download from the website of the Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE), said Haldighati was named after these women who had haldi (turmeric) on their hands as part of their wedding rituals.The particular chapter quoted from Dr Mahendra Bhanawat’s book, Ajooba Bharat, as source of this information.“Haldighati ka naam haldi rangi mitti ke karan nahi pada. Aisi mitti yahan hai bhi kahan? Lal, peeli aur kali teen rango wali mitti hai phir Haldighati naam kyo diya gaya? Iska ekmatra karan yeh hai ki yahan haldi chadhi kai nav vivahitayein purush vesh me lad marin (Haldighati didn’t get its name due to turmeric coloured soil. Where was soil of this colour? There are only three colours of soil – red, yellow and black. The only reason for this name is that newlywed women in men’s clothes who had turmeric on their hands fought and died here),” the book says on page 12 of the first chapter.Another RBSE book says Maharana Pratap “lacked the patience, control and planning which is required in a military commander during hostile circumstances”.When contacted, Dr Bhanawat said he wasn’t aware of a Board textbook quoting him. “It is true that there was a practice of women fighting wars from the time of Rana Sanga. In the Haldighati battle, when Pratap’s army was outnumbered by the Mughals, 150 women led by Pratap’s wife fought,” he said.Professor BM Sharma, former chairman of Rajasthan Public Service Commission, was convener of the textbook review committee set up by the Congress government “to remove discrepancies in school textbooks introduced by the BJP government”.He said he was coordinator of the committee but it would be better to ask the board about anything contained in the textbooks.RBSE chairman DP Jaroli said when he took charge, the committee was already working. “I am busy in the Class 10 and 12 exams. I will look into this after the exams. If there’s anything wrong, we will get it rectified,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/newlywed-brides-fought-in-battle-of-haldighati-says-rajasthan-textbook/story-4Kudctc3BABBrNv8SIYsiN.html

Nepalese parliament recently adopted a new political map of the country showing these areas as part of its own territory, a move strongly opposed by India. “Some Nepalese FM channels have of late started playing anti-India speeches in between Nepali songs,” said Shalu Datal, a resident of Dantu village in Pithoragarh’s Dharchula sub-division. “As people on both sides of the border listen to Nepali songs, they also hear the anti-India speeches delivered by Nepalese leaders in between them,” she said. The main FM stations playing anti-India content between songs are Naya Nepal and Kalapani Radio, Datal said. “Some old channels like Mallikarjun Radio and a website named annapurna.online are also broadcasting reports depicting Kalapani as Nepalese territory,” she said. The FM stations are situated at Chabrigar near the district headquarters in Nepal’s Dharchula. The stations have a range of about three kilometers and can be heard in Dharchula, Baluakot, Jauljibi and Kalika on the Indian side of the border. These radio stations have also started giving weather reports on Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura, treating them as Nepalese territory, Krishna Garbiyal, a Rang community leader based in Dharchula said. However, the district administration and police said they have no information about any anti-India propaganda launched by Nepal through its FM radio channels. “We have no feedback from our intelligence units on the subject,” Pithoragarh Superintendent of Police Preeti Priyadarshini said. Dharchula Circle Officer V K Acharya also expressed ignorance. “Our intelligence units have not yet spoken about any such anti-India propaganda by Nepal,” he said. Ashok Nabiyal, a leader from Vyas Valley, said Indian intelligence agencies active on the border need to take cognizance of the situation to be able to counter the propaganda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-s-fm-radio-stations-beam-propaganda-across-border-say-lipulekh-theirs/story-1yr6mNAWzFpggSuIQhtQRM.html

21-06-2020||India||In fresh jibe at PM Modi on India-China face-off, Rahul Gandhi again accuses govt of surrendering Indian territory||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi further sharpened his attack on the government on the face-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers in Ladakh region. And in his direct line of fire is Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Narendra Modi is actually Surender Modi,” Gandhi tweeted on Sunday. He again attached a news article on along with his tweet which looks at India’s policy towards China. Narendra ModiIs actuallySurender Modihttps://t.co/PbQ44skm0ZHe had attacked the Prime Minister on Saturday too, accusing him of surrendering India’s territory to China. In that tweet, he had used PM Modi’s quote at the all-party meeting where he had asserted that Chinese troops did not intrude Indian territory.“PM has surrendered Indian territory to Chinese aggression. If the land was Chinese: 1. Why were our soldiers killed? 2. Where were they killed?” Gandhi had said in his tweet on Saturday. Also Watch | ‘PM Modi contradicted defence, foreign minister’: Congress on China clashUnion home minister Amit Shah hit back, advising Gandhi to rise above petty politics and stand in solidarity with national interest at a time when the entire country is united.PM Modi had called an all-party meeting on the issue where he said that no intruder was on Indian territory across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China and no Indian military post had been captured.“Because of the improved patrolling, our vigilance has gone up and the military gets to know what is happening on the borders at the right time,” Modi said at the all-party meeting, pointing out that Indian soldiers were able to intercept the Chinese forces who earlier had a free run. “If you keep on intercepting them, it is obvious that tensions will rise,” he said.But the Congress dubbed it as “a lame attempt to obfuscate the truth”.“First of all, PMO and the Government need to clearly state their position on the Galwan Valley. Is Galwan Valley not part of Indian territory? Why is Government not coming forward and strongly rebutting the Chinese claim over Galwan Valley? If Chinese troops are present there, does it not amount to intrusion into and occupation of Indian territory? Also, why is the Government silent on intrusions in the Pangong Tso area?” the Congress party said in a statement.The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) then said that PM Modi’s comments at the all-party meeting were given a “mischievous interpretation”.“Attempts are being made in some quarters to give a mischievous interpretation to remarks by the Prime Minister at the all-party meeting yesterday. The Prime Minister was clear that India would respond firmly to any attempts to transgress the LAC,” the statement said.The war of words has been going on since 20 Indian soldiers were killed in the Galwan Valley in Ladakh on June 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-fresh-jibe-at-pm-modi-on-india-china-face-off-rahul-gandhi-again-accuses-govt-of-surrendering-indian-territory/story-23lB42Fw8bVOiA9GPJcQiJ.html

21-06-2020||India||Yoga can be solution for stress created by Covid-19: Venkaiah Naidu||Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday said people should be physically and mentally healthy to put up a united fight against the novel coronavirus as humanity cannot allow the pandemic to get the better of it.  He also said that yoga can be an effective solution for the high level of stress that the pandemic has created in our lives.“Yoga is a relatively low-risk, high-yield approach to improving overall health and its full potential must be harnessed,” he said addressing an event to mark the International Day of Yoga.Expressing concern over instances of youngsters ending their lives “when unable to cope with the modern-day pressures and stress”, he said all such deaths were completely avoidable. Yoga can help in dealing effectively with problems like depression, anxiety and stress, which have become all-pervasive due to modern lifestyle, he said according to a statement.Pointing out that the pandemic was not the only health crisis that was threatening the well-being of the people, he expressed concern over the increase in lifestyle diseases. Quoting the WHO, he said it was estimated that 63 per cent of all deaths in India in 2016 were because of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).“Yoga remains an incredibly simple but powerful instrument to prevent and control lifestyle diseases,”  Naidu observed.Referring to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the physical and mental health of the people, the Vice President said the world is going through challenging times and “we simply cannot allow the pandemic to get the better of us. We have to unite and put up a stronger fight and to ensure that we are healthy, both physically and mentally.” He also urged educational institutions to include yoga as part of online learning programmes being held in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, saying it is one of the best options to improve the body’s immunity.He said yoga is a unique gift of India to the world which is successfully transforming millions of lives around the globe.He said children must be introduced to Yoga at a young age. Observing that the 5,000-year-old tradition is not a mere workout, he said, “It is a science that emphasises balance, poise, grace, equanimity, peace and harmony”. Calling for large-scale scientific experimentation to further explore the immense possibilities of yoga as a wellness solution,  Naidu said it is a mode of therapy or “yog chikitsa” that has become extremely popular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yoga-can-be-solution-for-stress-created-by-covid-19-venkaiah-naidu/story-HV2vJ3DA1DvWvCSWrvlLvO.html

21-06-2020||India||‘Let’s hurt them economically’: General VK Singh on India-China border row||Minister of state for road transport and highways and former Chief of Army Staff (COAS), General VK Singh said the latest transgression by China into Indian territory has created a trust deficit. He also said war is the last resort, but there are many ways, including an economic boycott that can be an apt response to China.Here are the excerpts of Singh’s conversation with HTQ: As an ex-army chief what is your reading of the ground situation?A: It is firmly in control of the Indian troops. There are no intrusions. There are transgressions, not intrusions. Where PP 14 is concerned, there is no intrusion whatsoever. Where PP 15 area is concerned, every year they have been trying to transgress and every year we push them to go back.Where Pangong Tso is concerned, this is not just a yearly feature, but happens in the summer and sometimes in the winter also. These have been happening, the only difference this time is that the transgression has involved a certain amount of stealth in the Pangong Tso area, they’ve done things which they have never done earlier.Q: Like what?A: Trying to land some troops behind Finger 4, this they did for the first time. And the aim is clear - they want to push us from Finger 4. Our people, however, will take care of that.Also read: ‘No restrictions on using firearms’ - India gives soldiers freedom along LACQ: Is that what the negotiation and talks were about? A: The talks were about wherever there have been transgression - like at PP 14 where they said the LAC is not this way but is a different way. They have been told that we’ve been sitting here on this for decades now, where is the doubt. Same is true for other regions including Chumar. They try and come to the Heights opposite the DBO. All this is very old it’s not new. What is new is as the infrastructure becomes better they try to overawe us by more strength or vehicles. Also Watch | Can India fight war on two fronts with China & Pakistan? Gen VP Malik answersQ: There are questions about why there was ambiguity about the Chinese being on our territory and now them claiming the Galwan.A: They are not on our territory. The LAC is an interpretation from a map given in 1959 and the Chinese keep advancing some claim or the other. The LAC is not marked on the ground, there is no agreement on it. There is a certain amount of flexibility that exists out there. But there are places where both sides know their sides and ensure these are protected. Where there is no man’s land, which comes up because of these perceptional differences, is where these patrol face-offs take place.Q: What details do we have of the casualties on the Chinese side? Did we detain any PLA soldiers and how many?A: In the 1962 war, they never told anybody how many casualties they suffered. It was sometime in the 2000s when they said we suffered a few hundred (casualties), but people who fought know exactly how much they had suffered. They are good at deception because they don’t want the people to get anti-government or raise objections.I’m quite sure they must be disposing of the dead also in a manner that others don’t come to know. There was talk of 43 persons in the beginning, in the media. I would say whoever put out that figure, based on what the troops had said, is the minimum. There may be more.Since we did not cross the Line of Actual Control, they were on one side of the river near PP 14. So, most of the things were on each side, it was not something that was on our side. What happened was that people got separated. In the melee, where there are over 600 people just jostling, scuffling, pushing and hitting each other and in a dark night some people got separated; their people on our side and our people on their side. But in the morning they were exchanged. I was told that one of their chaps said we have treated your people well and our chaps said we have also treated your people well. Matter ended there with no brouhaha about it.Q: Do we have a number? A: As per my information we had some people.Q: On Friday, Congress president Sonia Gandhi at the all-party meeting asked if this was an intelligence failure.A: I am not in a position to respond because intelligence is a domain that is looked after by the R&AW. What I can refute is that it is a military intelligence failure, because they have been debarred from looking across the LoC and the LAC. This happened in 2012 and Sonia Gandhi should have known about it. Q: There are questions about the policy of using arms at LAC too.A: In the dark of the night… you are among 600 people carrying weapons, you don’t know where your people are. What happens if somebody fires breaking the agreement? These agreements have been there and both sides are adhering to it, if one side breaks it then the other side will also break it.So far, we haven’t had any problems. That is why this pushing and jostling took place, otherwise firing would’ve taken place. Just like what happened on the Line of Control that we don’t have an agreement of a similar nature but other agreements. There are protocols that have come into being over a period of time after negotiations of the border peace and treaty agreement and unfortunately, you have to follow them. [If] You want to break them, then somebody should take a decision. If Congress is so concerned about it, they should have broken it and not gotten into it. As a military man, I can say, I don’t think the military wanted it and I don’t think the military was even consulted on it. Q: What has changed after Monday’s conflict? A: The only thing that has changed is that we knew they were deceitful but they will engineer such a big deceit on us... it leads to loss of confidence. And we will think 10 times before believing them that they will do a particular thing. We will be more prepared for any eventuality that will follow.Q: You also said China did this to deflect attention. Would you explain?A: Why would China try to do things at the border, it is there any reason? In China nothing happens at the local level, it all comes from the top and who is the head of the military commission, Xi Jinping. So this is not like India where broad instructions are there and commanders do their own things. What is it that they want to divert attention from? They are in the firing line of all the countries in the world because of Covid-19, they are having problems in Hong Kong, they have problems in the South China Sea, they have trade problems with the United States, everybody is blaming them for everything. It means they want to divert attention from something.Q: The PM said the sacrifice of our soldiers will not go in vain. What do you think will be an apt response to China?A: If you’re going to tell about the response now then the response is of no use whatsoever. I am sure the required people have been tasked to think of what can be done, what cannot be done and what all measures have to be taken. The first thing that has been given out is to boycott Chinese goods, let’s start with this. Let’s hurt them economically other things will follow. War and use of force is the last resort always and every time. When all other means fail then you resort to this. There are many means available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/war-is-the-last-resort-let-s-hurt-them-economically-general-vk-singh-on-india-china-border-row/story-0abNH3yfPoE979VtbmQdJN.html

Some of the companies are at various intermediate stages of inspection of manufacturing facilities, verification of data, stability testing, emergency laboratory testing as per protocol etc,” said official.“Being an injectable formulation, testing for assay, identity, impurities, bacterial endotoxin test and sterility become very critical for patient safety and this data need to be provided by the companies.CDSCO is awaiting the data and is providing complete support to these companies,” said the official.Apart from this, pharma companies have been directed to take written informed consent of each and every patient, results of additional clinical trials to be submitted, active surveillance data of all treated patients to be submitted, risk management plan along with active post marketing surveillance and reporting of serious adverse events also to be submitted, said the official.It has already waived off the requirement of local clinical trials for these companies by invoking emergency provisions. The regulatory processes are being facilitated and expedited by CDSCO, official said.The union health ministry’s recent issued clinical management guidelines for Covid-19. In the latest protocol, the health ministry has described the use of Remdesivir drug as investigational therapy on coronavirus patient.“Patient can be administered with 200 mg IV on day 1 followed by 100 mg IV daily for 5 days. The drug cannot be administered to a pregnant or lactating mother and children below age of 12years. The drug is not recommended to patient with liver problems and renal complications,” stated the clinical management protocol on Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/domestic-pharma-giants-cipla-hetero-got-dcgi-s-nod-to-manufacture-sell-anti-viral-remdesivir-drug-to-fight-covid-19/story-d0SO89nj6xi7fLG7C29SWM.html

21-06-2020||India||First 1 lakh cases in 78 days, latest in just 8: Tracking Covid-19 spike in India||The number of coronavirus cases in India is very close to 4,00,000 mark. The country nears this grim milestone as a result of the spike in the number of cases in the last few days.In fact, the latest 1,00,000 infections in the country have been recorded in just eight days. This is lower than the 10 days it took for the previous 1,00,000 infections and 15 days for the 1,00,000 cases before that mark.The milestone of first one lakh cases was crossed in 78 days, after India imposed a lockdown to check the spread of the coronavirus disease. Experts say that India was able to control the early spike because of the lockdown, which was imposed in March when the country had just over 600 confirmed Covid-19 cases.An analysis of the spread of the disease done by Hindustan Times shows that about 75 per cent of the total infections in India have been reported between May 19 and June 20.The Union health ministry dashboard shows the number of cases in the country are 3,95,048. The number of active cases are 1,68,269 and 2,13,830 patients have been cured or discharged.If we compare the infection data of last one month, the rate of samples testing positive has gone up from 4.6 per cent for the week ending May 17 to 7.8 per cent till June 17. The nodal agency for testing the samples in the country is the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) which has said that 6.3 per cent samples of the over 6.6 million samples have tested positive.Also read | 8 week lockdown led to India pushing coronavirus peak to November: StudyOut of these, 1,89,869 tests were conducted in the previous 24-hour period, ICMR said on Saturday morning.The increase in the testing capacity, coupled with the rise in the number of patients being diagnosed for Covid-19, is an indication of the virus’ prevalence in India, experts say.“It is only natural that if you test more, more people will test positive... India is currently at the ascending limb of the epidemic. We have not reached the peak [of infections] yet, and in this situation, this is what will happen (more people will test positive),” said Dr Lalit Kant, the former head of epidemiology and communicable disease at ICMR.Covid-19 has crippled economies across the globe and countries have put in place strick lockdowns to slow its spread. The disease originated in China’s Wuhan late last year and has so far infected over 8.8 million people and claimed 4,64,294 lives globally.Experts say the pandemic is now in its third surge of the outbreak - the first being in China, second in Europe and the US, and the latest thriving in Latin American countries such as Brazil, Peru and Chile along with India, Mexico and Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-1-lakh-cases-in-78-days-latest-in-just-8-tracking-covid-19-spike-in-india/story-kwYotHZwLFL98GuVQNw1BL.html

Yoga can definitely help us make this happen,” the PM said.He also talked about karma yoga, saying if we do our jobs with discipline and carry our responsibilities well, even that is yoga.“In the Gita, Lord Krishna while explaining yoga has said: ‘Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam’ which means that the efficiency in action is yoga. This mantra always teaches that if we practice yoga, we can make ourselves better in our lives,” he said.“There is a saying here that yuktāhāravihārasya yuktaceṣṭasya karmasu, yuktasvapnāvabodhasya yogo bhavati duḥkhahā. It means eating the right food, exercising in the right way, following right habits of sleeping and waking up, and doing our work and our duties correctly is yoga,” he added.Karma yoga helps us find a solution to all our pains and problems, he said.“The meaning of yoga is samtvam yoga uchayate. That is remaining steadfast in every situation: adversity and hostility, success and failure, happiness and crisis is yoga,” PM Modi said.This is the first time since June 21, 2015, the International Yoga Day is being observed digitally amid the coronavirus pandemic.This year’s theme is ‘Yoga at Home and Yoga with Family’.PM Modi had urged people, in a video message on Thursday, to observe the day from their homes due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yoga-is-about-doing-our-duties-well-pm-modi-on-international-yoga-day/story-m3JHBjmfZM4eY4V2Wrw1mI.html

But they didn’t relent,” Vijay Kumar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI earlier in the day.“Two of them are active since 2019. One was involved in attack on two BSF (Border Security Force) jawans last month,” Kumar added.In May, security forces had gunned two terrorists of the Hizbul Mujahideen, including the son of a Kashmiri separatist leader, after an hours-long gunbattle on in Nawa Kadal locality of Srinagar.More than a dozen houses were also damaged in the blaze that erupted after several blasts and exchange of fire between terrorists and security forces during a 12-hour encounter in Nawa Kadal area on May 19.

21-06-2020||India||Solar eclipse today: India timings, locations and other details||Skywatchers along a narrow band from west Africa to the Arabian Peninsula, India and southern China will witness on Sunday a dramatic “ring of fire” solar eclipse.The partial phase of the eclipse will begin at 9.16 am. The annular phase will start at 10.19 am and end at 2.02 pm. The partial phase of the eclipse will end at 3.04 pm, the Ministry of Earth Sciences said.“Close to noon, for a small belt in north India the eclipse will turn into a beautiful annular (ring-shaped) one since the Moon is not close enough to cover the Sun completely,” the Astronomical Society of India said on Saturday.Follow Solar Eclipse LIVE updates here“Places like Delhi will be dark for 5-7 minutes from 11 to 11.30 am,” said Arvind Paranjpye, the Director of the Nehru Planetarium in Mumbai. Also Watch | Solar Eclipse 2020: Watch captivating images of the ‘ring of fire’ from across the countryThe parts of northern India where the annular phase (ring of fire) of the eclipse will be visible are Dehradun, Kurukshetra, Chamoli, Joshimath, Sirsa, Suratgarh. From the rest of the country, it will be visible as partial solar eclipse.A solar eclipse occurs when the moon, earth and sun come in a straight line, with the moon between the earth and the sun.However, unlike a full solar eclipse when the sun is entirely covered by the moon for a brief period, during the annular eclipse, the angular diameter of the moon falls short of that of the sun and it fails to cover up the latter completely. As a result a ring of the sun’s disk remains visible around the moon. Hence, an annular solar eclipse is popularly known as ‘ring of fire’.The next annular eclipse will be seen from South America in December 2020. Another annular eclipse will occur in 2022, but that it will be hardly visible from India, news agency PTI quoted N Rathnashree, Director of Nehru Planetarium in Delhi, as saying.Today’s celestial event will is coinciding with the summer solstice which is the longest day in the Northern Hemisphere. Here are the tips issued by the government for those who want to watch the eclipse: • Do not use sunglasses, goggles, exposed X-ray sheet or lampblack over a glass. They are not safe. Nor is viewing the Sun’s image on the surface of the water. Only Welders glass number13 or number 14 can be used to see the Sun directly with naked eyes.• You can make a pinhole in a card sheet and hold it under the Sun. At some distance, keep a screen of white paper. The Sun’s image can be seen on this sheet. By adjusting the gap between the sheet and the screen, the image can be made larger.• Look at the shadow of a bush or a tree. With the gaps between the leaves acting like a pinhole, numerous images of the eclipsed Sun can be seen on the ground.• You can use a strainer for making pinhole images.• Cover the ‘compact’ makeup kit mirror with black paper, with a small hole at the centre. Reflect the image of the Sun on a distant wall in shadow. You can get a projected image of the eclipsed Sun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/solar-eclipse-today-india-timings-locations-and-other-details/story-GbT7vP2ljjh8WS8CLaF4fM.html

21-06-2020||India||Kerala Cong chief’s remarks against health minister anti-women: CM Vijayan||Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday came down heavily against state Congress president Mullappally Ramachandran for calling health minister KK Shailaja ‘Covid Rani’ and ‘Nipah Rajkumari’. The CM said the remarks were “anti-women”. He also questioned Congress party’s silence over the remarks.“His remarks were anti-women. They were intended to target her personally. Sad, he is stooped to such a low. What is surprising is the continued silence of the party leadership,” the CM said. Though his remarks triggered a controversy and invited criticism from many sections, the PCC chief has, however, refused to apologise on the issue, saying his a section of the media had twisted his words. Ramachandran said ‘Rani’ and ‘Rajkumari’ were not derogatory terms and there was no need to apologise over them. He had made these remarks on Friday while Inaugurating the one-day fast of opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala before state secretariat demanding withdrawal of a government circular insisting on Covid-free certificates for expatriates returning to the state. He said he used these epithets with good intention to expose the state’s failure on Covid-19 and there was no need to apologise. “I stick to what I said. Queen and Rajkumari are not derogatory terms either. I always hold women in high esteem. Recently a UK paper (The Guardian) had called the minister a ‘rock star,” he said on Saturday. But chief minister Vijayan said the Congress leader’s justification exposes the decay that has gripped the party. “The minister was targeted to sabotage the ongoing fight against the pandemic. We have no idea why some good words about the state is making Congress leaders so nervous,” the CM said, adding the government will not allow the party to attack her personally. Meanwhile, the total number of coronavirus cases crossed 3,000 in Kerala on Satruday with the state recording 127 infections - its highest single-day spike so far. . Out of 3039 cases, 1,566 have recovered and 1,450 are active cases. Out of 127 fresh cases on Saturday, 87 are expatriates and 36 came from other states, the CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cong-chief-s-remarks-against-health-minister-anti-women-cm-vijayan/story-rBu2pGD3fWXa17WJlgm2xM.html
21-06-2020||India||Trump says US trying to ‘help’ India, China sort ‘big problem’||US President Donald Trump made yet another foray into the India-China conflict saying the Asian neighbours are dealing with a “big problem” and the United States will try to “help them out”.The American leader did not repeat his earlier offer of mediation, which has been firmly turned down by both India and China. But he did say the United States is “talking” to them.The president did not take sides in the short observation on the conflict made in response to a reporter’s question before departing the White House for his election rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, later in the evening on Saturday.“It’s a very tough situation,” Trump said when asked for his assessment of the situation. “We’re talking to India. We’re talking to China.”Also read: ‘No restrictions on using firearms’: India gives soldiers freedom along LAC in extraordinary timesHe added: “They’ve got a big problem there. They’ve come to blows, and we’ll see what happens. We’ll try and help them out.”The US president had on May 28 made an explicit offer of mediation and had gone on to misleadingly claim he had discussed the situation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They hadn’t till then, but did later in a June 2 call. But Trump did not pursue his offer after being turned down.Trump has been keen to intercede in this part of Asia one way or another for months now. He first offered to mediate in the India-Pakistan tensions last summer in the aftermath of the Pulwama terrorist attacks. Though the first offer, elicited from him by the visiting Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan, was swiftly rejected by New Delhi, the president had persisted, using a range of synonyms.Now, the India-China conflict.. But even as he offers to help, he has been careful to not take sides, unlike his secretary of state Michael Pompeo, who has been very clear who he thinks is to blame.A timeline: India-China’s deadliest border clash since 1975 explained“The PLA has escalated border tensions - we see it today in India, the world’s most popular - populous democracy,” Pompeo said referring to the Chinese military in a virtual conference of the Copenhagen Democracy Summit on Friday.He had gone on to call China a “rogue actor” not only to its Asian neighbourhood but far beyond to the rest of the world.The top American diplomat has conveyed his condolences on the death of 20 Indian soldiers in deadly June 15 clashes, that marked the first fatalities on the India-China border in 45 years. He made no mention of the Chinese casualties. The Chinese have not declared their fatalities but they are estimated to have lost more than 40 according to Indian officials.US lawmakers have also been very clear about their view of the conflicts that have been on no for weeks now in fits and bursts. “I am extremely concerned by the ongoing Chinese aggression along the Line of Actual Control on the India-China border,” Eliot Engel, Democrat who heads the powerful House foreign affairs committee, said in a statement earlier in the month. “China is demonstrating once again that it is willing to bully its neighbors rather than resolve conflicts according to international law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trump-says-us-trying-to-help-india-china-sort-big-problem/story-cm3XYh9MQ59QzgtG7U5V6J.html
21-06-2020||India||On International Yoga Day, PM Modi stresses on pranayama||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on International Yoga Day on Sunday focussed on the importance of one of the techniques of controlling the breath in yoga and its benefits to fight the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has affected and killed millions across the world.As the Prime Minister delivered his message to the nation on the International Yoga Day, he said the coronavirus disease specifically attacks our respiratory system and pranayama is one asana which will help us the most in strengthening it.PM Modi said the anulom-vilom pranayama is more popular and is also very effective.

Therefore, my special request to you is that you must include pranayama in your daily practice, and along with the Anulom-Viloma, also learn many pranayama techniques,” he said. “A large number of Covid-19 patients are experiencing the benefits of these methods of yoga all over the world today. The strength of yoga is helping them to defeat this disease,” he added.He said anybody can embrace yoga as all one needs is some time and empty space.“If we can fine-tune our chords of health and hope, the day is not far away when the world will witness the success of healthy and happy humanity.

21-06-2020||India||100 days of Covid-19: Learning to parent through a pandemic||‘More alcohol’. That was the most succinct response we got to the question, how have you changed as a parent in the lockdown. It was a joke. But humour’s been one of the things that have helped families stay sane through the past 100 days.Much of the humour is dark and / or rooted in the ongoing tragedy. Like the viral tweet about the little boy who wouldn’t stop crying because he’d been promised a treat that hadn’t materialised. When did we promise this, his dad asked. Trying to say ‘in the morning’, but confused by his now-garbled sense of time, all he could manage was ‘A long time ago today’.In Mumbai, the parents of six-year-old Lyra recently asked what she was building with her Lego blocks and were told, very seriously, that they were hospitals. It’s all she builds now.“That’s when we realised what a toll this was taking,” says her mother. To try and help take her mind off things, they’ve been letting her go to the pet store in their building, to pet the dogs.Innovation, empathy and patience are key tools parents have been deploying in the lockdown, to make it work for the family, amid constraints of space, money, privacy and peer company.“Living the idea that parenting is not just expecting your kids to step up, but also walking a mile in their shoes… that’s been a lesson for me,” says Dhanashri Bhosale, 43, an architect and mother of two teens. “I’ve also realised that I need to upgrade myself if I want to understand their world. So I’m spending a bit more time online. I have let my guard down a lot more. I want them to know they can communicate with me.”As a byproduct of the lockdown, the performative element of parenting in middle- and upper-middle-class urban India has declined. There’s less pressure on children, because there are just fewer goals available. This means parents are seeing their children differently; seeing them for who they are, as one put it, rather than as an amalgam of the various children they’ve been.“At this point, I feel I need not focus only on career and achievements. The humanitarian aspects have taken precedence,” adds Bhosale. “For instance, I was pleasantly surprised when I was worrying about my son’s school not yet starting online classes, and he said, ‘Not everyone might have the facility at home. It’s okay to wait, ma’.”There’s a back-to-the-basics clarity about the role of the parent. Keep the child safe, keep them fed, keep them occupied and calm, and talk, talk, talk. In most cases, parents have seen children reciprocate in kind, whether they’re 6 or 16. “We’ve discovered a capacity for working as a team and managing with limited resources — whether for recreation or recipes or company,” says Ekta Pillai, 41, homemaker and mother of Aahiel, 12. Family time has made a roaring comeback. All meals are eaten together; chores are done together. In some cases the TV and laptop are shared. This has placed a certain amount of pressure on sibling relationships, but even more on the marriage — as one mother put it, it’s hard to parent, and especially hard to discipline, under the constant watch of someone who would typically take a different approach (and was usually away at work for this bit).“Juggling parenting styles while also having to juggle the roles of teacher, guide, counsellor, friend and parent, plus work and housework, has been a common pain point,” says Kamna Chhibber, head of mental health and behavioural sciences at Fortis Healthcare, Gurugram, which has been offering counselling through the lockdown via voice and video calls.It’s been a double adaptation for some. The generation gap was large to begin with, between some of today’s parents and children. “The way society and community were changing, conversations around gender and sexuality, religion, tech, politics, all of it had been a challenge. There was near-constant adapting. Covid-19 has made this even more daunting,” Chhibber says.The lockdown has also been particularly hard on parents of children with special needs, and parents of toddlers. Vaccine cycles have been disrupted, routine checks have become nerve-wracking, and there’s the added burden of childcare with no help.The loss of the offline social network has been very keenly felt. “These parents are having to work doubly hard in the absence of their network,” says developmental paediatrician Samir Dalwai, founder of the New Horizons Health and Research Foundation. “For certain kinds of special-needs children, online learning can also be harder. For some, outdoor activity is almost a prescription. Here, parents have been resorting to staircase space, a therapy ball, even an old truck tyre. And all these are good ideas, and have been working.”In addition to age — teens tend to get restless more easily; younger children are more able to entertain themselves for longer periods, and suffer less anxiety about what comes next — type of schooling has proved pivotal.The more rigidly structured courses have instituted virtual attendance, tests and worksheets. One dad had to rush around trying to buy a printer, the day the lockdown was enforced. Juggling work, housework, classes and homework has pushed others to the brink.One mom was so exhausted by the sheets and sheets of algebra fractions that she said she felt like pulling her hair out, at which point her daughter responded curtly, ‘Keep your hair on, mom’ — which has since become the lockdown anthem in their home.“Younger children are typically more resilient by design. Their lack of knowledge and understanding of the scale of things, helps,” Chhibber says.What happens next is a question that’s plaguing children, and parents too — not just with regard to the courses / exams / jobs situation, but also, what is the likely long-term impact of this lockdown on my child?Counsellors say they can’t answer that one; it’s too soon to know. But the fact that everyone has been stuck in the same situation should alleviate some of the long-term effects.In terms of being stuck in the same situation, parents say it’s also been helpful to discover that there is no correct number of children for a lockdown. One is too few; any more is an endless roundabout of cooking, washing up, arguing over space / toys / rules / chores, and elaborate disputes redressal systems.For some children, this has been the first time in their lives that they’ve gone this long with nothing new, no special outings, parties or vacations.“Parents are learning to spend less money. What was, for many, a cycle of heedless consumerism has been broken. There is no hankering for the next big thing,” says family counsellor Gouri Dange. “Children are being taught to manage with what they have.”Instead of things, innovation and effort have reclaimed their place at the heart of special occasions. Like the ‘flight experience’ that Rachana Adalja created for her six-year-old daughter and a friend, in their living room. She put luggage tags on two suitcases, fixed screens to the backs of chairs and offered an ‘in-flight’ meal of Maggi and soup.Pallavi Singh, 38, a homemaker from Indore, celebrated her daughter Kimaya’s fifth birthday by transforming part of their living room into a ‘fairyland’, with the help of some toys, Barbie props and balloons. “She had a Zoom party with friends and cousins. They played games and laughed a lot,” Pallavi says.Rec time and celebrations have also encompassed joint cooking or baking projects, question hour and quiz games, dress-up and dance parties.So, will lockdown change how we parent for good? How much of the old styles of parenting will return — less democracy, less conversation, less quality time, fewer family meals? “The ability to have more conversations will remain, I hope,” says Chhibber.“In the long term, parents will learn to depend on themselves,” Dalwai adds. “They will have greater trust in their child’s ability to cope. And will realise, hopefully, that children don’t need that many things and lists. Sometimes all they need is time and patience and a say in how things are done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100-days-of-covid-19-learning-to-parent-through-a-pandemic/story-SNDQli9oHCkZ0doYIvi1OO.html
21-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||June 20. There’s no breaking it gently; things are getting worse around the world in terms of the spread of the coronavirus disease.Sure, the disease isn’t the mystery it once was; every passing day increases our knowledge of the Sars-CoV-2 virus and the Covid-19 disease, and while we may still not have a cure, we have a fairly good idea of which medicines and lines of treatment work and which don’t (and there’s new information almost every other day). There’s a general agreement around the world that doctors have become better at saving lives.Also read: India’s Covid-19 count crosses 4 lakh, deaths reach 13,000-markBut the disease is raging though the world.Numbers from three different sources tell the same story.According to data on worldometers.info, 42% of the current cases in the world (close to 8.7 million on June 19) have been recorded in the past month (since May 20).According to The New York Times database, 177,225 new cases (a record high) were registered around the world on June 19.According to the dashboard maintained by the Johns Hopkins University, the five-day moving average is trending upward in eight of the 10 countries that are currently seeing the most number of cases. These are: Brazil, US, India, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Pakistan, and Iran. The two where it isn’t are Russia and the UK. Five-day moving averages even out kinks caused by events such as countries suddenly deciding to change the way they report cases or spikes caused by back-dated reporting. (That’s another thing that has changed from the past — we have all taught ourselves how to read scientific papers and renewed our acquaintance with statistics).India isn’t bucking the trend (as clear by its presence among the eight countries whose five-day moving average is trending north).India added 14,677 new cases on June 19, the highest to date (this column is being written on Saturday morning) in a 24-hour period. The country has added 72% of its total cases (till June 19) in the month since May 20. That is almost three of every four cases. With positivity rates continuing to rise, or, at best, staying the same in many states, India’s numbers are certain to increase with more widespread testing (which probably explains why some states are going slow on tests in a display of extremely misplaced priorities).Also read: Scramble for beds, ambulances, confusion before order reversedGlobally, too, the consensus is that the number of cases will continue to rise as countries open up, or the virus shows up in hitherto uninfected or less-infected parts. The New York Times reports that four American states, Arizona, Florida, Oklahoma, and South Carolina touched their highest daily counts (of new cases) this week.This can be tiring.For almost 68 days until June 1, India was locked down. While many restrictions have been eased since, suburban trains, metros, and buses (in some states) remain off the roads; many people continue working from home; parks are open only for a few hours; and shopping for most people involves a mask-gloves-shower-wipe routine that is as time consuming as it is wearying. Restaurants are open, and going to one poses a definite risk, as does visiting a mall (and these are also open), but people are bored of eating at home (or ordering out). And Zoom parties, once the rage — as a Delhi resident, especially, I can understand why; it’s easier to get people to leave — are now as interesting as the weekly business review.So, bored, tired, lonely perhaps, and physically, mentally, and emotionally weary, we let things slip. And the virus wins.The really sick and the old (and the infirm) may need medical care to beat the virus; the rest of us just need stamina to outlast it.As John L Parker JR wrote in the best book about running that’s ever been written: “You don’t become a runner by winning a morning workout.”That fragment is from a longer paragraph that ends with the phrases: “The Trial of Miles; Miles of Trials.”That’s how it feels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-S5R873CPT2LzQKkbxx8zEJ.html
21-06-2020||India||Millions in India could be targeted by phishing attacks soon: Govt||Millions of Indians could be targeted by fake emails, social media posts or texts messages related to Covid-19 in order to steal their credentials or compromise their computers, India’s official cybersecurity agency Cert-IN said in an advisory uploaded on Friday, citing a report from independent researchers who said the attack is being planned by North Korea-based cyber criminals.The alert is the latest in a series of warnings from cybersecurity firms across the world about hackers exploiting interest in the coronavirus disease pandemic to lure people into clicking on fake login pages or downloading malicious files that could create a backdoor in their computers.“The phishing campaign is expected to impersonate government agencies, departments and trade associations tasked to oversee the disbursement of the government fiscal aid,” the advisory by Cert-IN (Indian Computer Emergency Response Team) said, citing a report by Singapore-based cybersecurity firm Cyfirma.Such campaigns usually have a financial motive since access to a person’s email account or their computers in entirety could allow the cybercriminals to break into people’s bank accounts.The potential for damage “is immeasurable”, Cyfirma’s CEO Kumar Ritesh said in response to questions over email. “When PII (personally identifiable information) is stolen, impersonation will take place where hackers can use your identity to commit all sort of crimes, or infiltrate corporate systems. For this particular phishing campaign, hackers are looking personal details / PAN no / communication address / health conditions,” he added.According to Cyfirma’s report, the attack is yet to begin and could involve two million email addresses that the cyber actor – identified as the well-known Lazarus group -- seem to have. The hackers, in particular, plan to capitalise on announcements of financial aid “to lure vulnerable individuals and companies into falling for the phishing attacks,” it said.Some of the other emails may pretend to be from authorities and offer people to sign-up for free Covid-19 testing.“As of time of reporting (18 Jun), we have not seen the phishing or impersonated sites defined in the email templates. But our research shows the hackers were planning to set that up in the next 24 hours,” the report said.It was unclear how the email addresses of the Indian targets were compromised. “But it is fairly easy to scrape and steal email address from social media and other platforms. Compromised email addresses can also be found on sale in dark web marketplaces,” Ritesh said.The campaign was also planning to target people in US, UK, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, it added.The analysis carried purported screenshots of some of the phishing emails, which showed the text appeared to be signed by government officials. The mails could be sent through spoofed addresses – one of the addresses it could be from is ncov@gov.in – and could include links or files that can deliver malicious code.In recent months, agencies have warned of hacking attempts involving Covid-19 – with one notable instance being fake Aarogya Setu applications that were being spread. These fake apps could allow a victim’s device to be turned into a spying tool, giving access to phone data, camera and the microphone.Some of these attacks involve state-based actors, and cyber threat analysts have highlighted the risks Indian citizens face due to inadequate data protection safeguards. “Knowing the work of state actors who are well-funded and highly resourceful, we cannot rule out further cyber activities that could arise from the phishing campaign,” said Ritesh..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-warn-against-phishing-attacks/story-duW9NWzajDNUekmUrsyjNJ.html
21-06-2020||India||Tahawwur Rana Rana re-arrested, faces extradition||Tahawwur Rana, a Pakistani-origin Canadian sent to a US jail for his role in planning the 2008 Mumbai attacks, has been arrested after being freed from prison in order to face extradition to India.Rana, 59, a close associate of David Coleman Headley, one of the main conspirators behind the attacks on India’s financial hub that killed 166 people, was serving a 14-year sentence in a Los Angeles federal prison when he was granted early release last week because of poor health and being infected by the coronavirus. However, he never left the prison as he was arrested to face extradition to India, US prosecutors told The Associated Press. Indian officials said they learnt Rana was rearrested on June 10.Officials familiar with developments said a US attorney informed the district judge in Los Angeles about India’s standing request for the extradition of Rana, wanted in India for terror charges. A senior National Investigation Agency (NIA) officer, who didn’t want to be named, said: “It’s a positive development after over 11 years. This means his extradition hearings will now take place.”Former home secretary GK Pillai, who played a key role in the investigation of the Mumbai attacks and coordinated with the US, said there was a pending Indian extradition request for Rana. “There is a standing Indian extradition request for Rana and that will still be applicable,” he told HT. A person in the government, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the US authorities acted as there was a request for Rana’s preliminary arrest. The person noted that arrest signalled the start of the extradition process.An NIA team that visited the US in late 2018 was informed by the department of justice it was convinced by India’s charges against Rana. Earlier, the “double jeopardy” clause in US law, according to which a person can’t be punished twice for the same crime, was hindering efforts to extradite Rana, but NIA made a fresh request in 2016 .India levelled the charges of forgery and criminal breach of trust as Rana used his firm for making documents for Headley during his surveillance missions in Mumbai. These charges were accepted by US prosecutors and the FBI, and they are inclined to honour India’s request. FBI arrested Rana on October 18, 2009 for providing material support for the conspiracy to commit terrorist acts outside the US.The former Pakistan Army physician-turned-businessman, was convicted in 2011 for providing material support to the Lashkar-e-Taiba for the Mumbai attacks, and for backing a planned attack on a Danish newspaper that printed caricatures of Prophet Mohammed in 2005. Headley was convicted during the same trial.At the time, US reports had said American prosecutors had failed to prove Rana supported the Mumbai attacks and he was cleared of this more serious charge by the jury at the trial. His legal team claimed he had been misled by Headley, who was a friend from school. Rana had been accused of allowing Headley to open a branch of his Chicago-based immigration law firm in Mumbai to act as a front for his surveillance activities in Mumbai ahead of the attacks that also injured hundreds. He was accused of allowing Headley to pose as a representative of the same firm when he went to Denmark for surveillance ahead of the planned attack.At the time, US prosecutors had said Rana knew Headley had trained with the LeT and that Headley had shared information of his surveillance activities in Mumbai and of the Taj Mahal Palace hotel, where LeT members later killed dozens of people.Headley was sentenced to 35 years in prison but can’t be extradited to India under a plea deal. Pakistani authorities had arrested seven men, including LeT operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, for the Mumbai attacks though their trial in an anti-terrorism court never made headway. Lakhvi was released on bail and his current whereabouts aren’t known.In Mumbai, Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh said,“Rana’s role had come to the fore during Headley’s testimony after the latter admitted that he was working as an agent for him. We are discussing the developments at top level and the government will take a decision about Rana’s extradition. We will speak to the Centre in this respect,” Deshmukh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tahawwur-rana-rana-re-arrested-faces-extradition/story-54ArxGBpMpB4nPxJYMDfYM.html
21-06-2020||India||Opposition parties in Sikkim question government’s handling of Covid-19 crisis||Covid-19 data that is being released by the Sikkim government on a daily basis is not only ‘confusing’ but also full of ‘discrepancies’, opposition parties in the Himalayan state have alleged.Sikkim, a small Himalayan state sharing borders with China, Bhutan and Nepal, reported 70 Covid-19 cases till Friday, out of which 21 patients have been discharged from hospitals, data provided by the state government shows. There have been no fatalities so far.But, a closer look at the data released over the past few days reveals that there has been some discrepancies. On June 11, the official data released by the state’s health department, claimed that at least 6,618 swab samples were tested. However, on June 12 the number of tests done was found to be 5,157.Bharat Basnet, president of the Pradesh Congress Committee of Sikkim said, “There are discrepancies in the Covid-19 data provided by the state. The situation could have improved had the state government called an all-party meeting before putting in place the combat techniques.” Sikkim was the first among the states to ban the entry of outsiders and migrant labourers. International borders with China, Nepal and Bhutan were also sealed. The state, however, witnessed a sharp spike after Sikkimese people returned when the nationwide lockdown was relaxed. Alleged discrepancies have also surfaced in the number of recoveries. While on June 16, the official data stated that five people had recovered, the number of people discharged from hospitals dropped to four the next day on June 17.Senior officials of the state government, however, have refuted the charges.“The official data provided on the morning of June 12 on total number of tests carried out did not reflect the number of tests carried out at the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital (NBMCH) in Siliguri, West Bengal,” said Kaden Zangmu, the nodal officer for Covid-19 in Sikkim.She further said, “Since June 12, the format of the health bulletin changed and 1,711 tests which were carried out at the NBMCH were not reflected in the bulletin.”The last sample sent to the NBMCH was on May 28. After that date, all the samples are being tested in the state’s own lab. “So far 8,894 samples including 1,711 sent to the NBMCH have been tested,” she said.“The total number of recovered cases on both June 16 and June 17 was 4. The portal where the data is updated is handled by the state home department.”Opposition parties including the Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF) and Congress said the data made available proved that the government is not serious about the figures.MK Subba, SDF spokesperson said, “There is total confusion in the handling of the Covid-19 crisis and data by the state government. The Sikkim government made a mistake by studying the Covid-19 impact and implemented mitigation measures very late. It has failed to follow the laid down reporting protocol and guidelines of the ICMR.” Pempa Tshering Bhutia, director general cum secretary of the state health and family welfare department said, “We have been sending total data including the tests carried out at NBMCH to the Centre on a daily basis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-parties-in-sikkim-question-government-s-handling-of-covid-19-crisis/story-mVABesS0jZpayk9g6CA6ON.html
21-06-2020||India||Another elephant carcass found in Odisha, fifth in last eight days||In another case of suspected poaching, the carcass of an elephant aged between 20 and 25 years was found in the forests of Odisha’s Angul district on Saturday, forest officials said.Forest department officials said the elephant was sighted roaming in the Chhendipada area of Angul Friday evening where it created panic before running into the Chhendipada Gudimara reserve forest. The elephant had earlier killed 2 people in last two months.Angul’s District Forest Officer V Kartik said the carcass was buried after post-mortem. “We suspect that the animal died of anthrax,” he said. However, wildlife activist Biswajit Mohanty said anthrax does not kill an elephant quickly. “Once infected by Anthrax, the elephant would show erratic behaviour for a week before succumbing to the disease. Nothing of that sort happened in this case. We suspect, the elephant came in contact with livewire trap set up by poachers to kill wild boars. A proper inquiry should be conducted to find out how it died,” he said.This is the fifth elephant to die in Odisha in the last eight days. Three days ago the bullet-ridden carcass of a 3-year-old male elephant was found in Boudh district. However, its tusks were intact. On June 12 and June 14 - a male, a female and a calf- died in Odisha after coming in contact with livewire set up by poachers to trap wild boars in Keonjhar and Sundargarh districts. A probe by the officials revealed that poachers had left livewire connected to 11 kv transmission lines for wild boars that left the three elephants dead.Wildlife officials said in last two-and-half months of lockdown, at least 15 elephants have died in Odisha, of which only died of natural causes. The deaths have been attributed to poaching, electrocution and other reasons. Four elephants died in Keonjhar division, 3 in Angul while Keonjhar (WL), Athagarh, Subarnapur, Bamra (WL), Khurda, Balasore, Sundargarh and Boudh reported one death each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-elephant-carcass-found-in-odisha-fifth-death-in-last-8-days/story-1gw9ysCsDWoZzoozxuemgM.html
21-06-2020||India||China looks for superspreader link in latest surge||BeijingA Covid-19 superspreader could have contributed in the rapid spread of more than 200 infections linked to a food market in Beijing, experts have said, as the Chinese capital scrambles to contain a fresh outbreak that has raised fears of a second wave of infections in the country, which has largely managed to control the contagion.New infections linked to the Xinfadi food market in Fengtai district of Beijing indicate the sign of a superspreader, Yang Zhanqiu, deputy director of the pathogen biology department at the Wuhan University, told the state media on Friday.Speculation about the presence of a superspreader — or a Covid-19 patient who has infected several others — comes in the backdrop of 22 new cases being reported in Beijing on Friday. The city has recorded 205 new cases since June 11. A new case related to the outbreak in neighbouring province Hebei was also reported on Friday.Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) emergencies chief, said a superspreading event could have amplified the spread of the fresh outbreak in Beijing. “You get a few cases occurring and it then is a superspreading event or something happening where there’s a large amplification of the disease. And when that happens, you want to avoid that first amplification turning back into community transmission,” he said in London on Friday. In line with Chinese researchers’ claims, Ryan confirmed that China has shared the genome sequence of the virus strain from its latest outbreak with the global community and said that it appears the virus was imported to Beijing from strains circulating in Europe.He noted that “strains and viruses have moved around the world” throughout the pandemic. Ryan said a detailed investigation into the recent Beijing outbreak was needed to find out how the imported cases sparked such a large cluster. The WHO official added that Beijing has done well to control the new outbreak from spreading.Authorities have scaled up efforts to stem the transmission of the disease in the capital, testing more than 2 million in the city of 20 million since June 13. Thousands of courier and food delivery personnel, and taxi drivers are also being tested in an effort to rein in the new outbreak.“Currently, the city has the ability to sample an average of 500,000 people per day. As of 6am on Saturday, a total of 2,297,000 people have finished sampling,” Zhang Qiang, a member of Beijing’s epidemic control office said at a press conference on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-looks-for-superspreader-link-in-latest-surge/story-p8WD94T8UqL8iZhrIxAAlL.html
21-06-2020||India||PMO says PM’s comments interpreted mischievously||The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said on Saturday that PM Narendra Modi’s remarks at an all-party meeting the previous day that no intruder was on Indian territory across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China and that no Indian military post had been captured were being given a “mischievous interpretation”. The PMO’s statement was a riposte to a Congress attack that Modi surrendered Indian territory in the face of Chinese aggression across the LAC and that his comments flew in the face of previous claims by defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar.“Attempts are being made in some quarters to give a mischievous interpretation to remarks by the Prime Minister at the all-party meeting yesterday. The Prime Minister was clear that India would respond firmly to any attempts to transgress the LAC,” the statement said.The PMO said that PM Modi specifically emphasised that in contrast to the past neglect of such challenges, Indian forces now decisively counter any violations of the LAC (“unhe rokte hain, unhe tokte hain”).“Because of the improved patrolling, our vigilance has gone up and the military gets to know what is happening on the borders at the right time,” Modi said at the all-party meeting, pointing out that Indian soldiers were able to intercept the Chinese forces who earlier had a free run. “If you keep on intercepting them, it is obvious that tensions will rise,” he said.The all-party meeting on Friday was called to discuss the situation along the LAC following the brutal June 15 brawl between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan valley in eastern Ladakh, in which 20 Indian personnel were killed. It was the first time since 1975 that India suffered combat fatalities in a skirmish with Chinese troops. Ten Indian soldiers detained by the Chinese side were later released after intense negotiations through diplomatic and military channels. China has so far not acknowledged any casualties among its troops. Following the PMO’s statements, the Congress party on Saturday termed it “a lame attempt to obfuscate the truth”. “First of all, PMO and the Government need to clearly state their position on the Galwan Valley. Is Galwan Valley not part of Indian territory? Why is Government not coming forward and strongly rebutting the Chinese claim over Galwan Valley? If Chinese troops are present there, does it not amount to intrusion into and occupation of Indian territory? Also, why is the Government silent on intrusions in the Pangong Tso area?” the Congress party said in a statement.Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi alleged that the Prime Minister had surrendered Indian territory to Chinese aggression. “If the land was Chinese: 1.Why were our soldiers killed? 2. Where were they killed?” he tweeted.The opposition party said that the PM’s statement belittled the gravity of the situation on the LAC.The government rebutted the claims and said that the all-party meeting was informed that this time “Chinese forces have come in much larger strength to the LAC” and that the Indian response was commensurate.“As regards transgression at the LAC, it was clearly stated that the violence in Galwan on June 15 arose because Chinese side was seeking to erect structures just across the LAC and refused to desist from such actions,” the PMO said in the statement.It also went on to add that the PM’s observation that there was no Chinese presence on the Indian side of the LAC pertained to the situation consequent to the bravery of the armed forces. “The sacrifices of the soldiers of the 16 Bihar Regiment foiled the attempt of the Chinese side to erect structures and also cleared the attempted transgression at this point of the LAC on that day,” it said.“Those who tried to transgress our land were taught a befitting lesson by our brave sons of soil,” the Prime Minister said, according to the PMO statement. And these words “succinctly summed up the ethos and the values of our armed forces”, the statement said.The government said an unnecessary controversy was being created to lower the morale of the soldiers for defending the borders. “What is Indian territory is clear from the map of India. This government is strongly and resolutely committed to that,” it added.Any unilateral change of the LAC will not be allowed, the government added.The government said all parties extended support to the government and the armed forces at Friday’s meeting. “The predominant sentiment at the meeting was of unequivocal support to the government and the armed forces at a time of national crisis. We are confident that the unity of the Indian people will not be undermined by motivated propaganda,” said the government.The PM assured opposition parties at the meeting that whether it was deployment, action or counter-action, Indian forces — be it on land, in the air or on the ocean — were doing everything to protect India’s borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmo-says-pm-s-comments-interpreted-mischievously/story-zZwCzJsjPVEK7egL54jltJ.html
21-06-2020||India||Order on institutional isolation for all Covid-19 patients in Delhi scrapped||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Saturday rolled back its controversial order to mandatorily quarantine even asymptomatic and mild coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases at institutional facilities for five days, in a move that was welcomed by the Delhi government and experts, who said the directive would have overwhelmed the Capital’s health care infrastructure.Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, who heads DDMA, issued the order on Saturday, with experts saying that thousands of additional patients at hospitals would strain the Capital’s health infrastructure, result in a shortage of health care workers, militate against people getting tested, and throw Delhi’s long-term strategy out of gear.“Regarding institutional isolation, only those COVID positive cases which do not require hospitalisation on clinical assessment & do not have adequate facilities for home isolation would be required to undergo institutional isolation,” Baijal tweeted on Saturday, about 24 hours after ordering the change in the guidelines. The LG, however, said that all Covid-19 patients will have to be referred to Covid Care Centres (CCCs) for assessment of their clinical conditions, severity of illness and presence of co-morbidities.In another tweet, he said DDMA approved the recommendations of a high-level expert committee for fixing subsidised rates for Covid-19 treatment at private hospitals of Delhi. Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said 100% Covid-19 beds in private hospitals will be subsidised up to an upper limit of 60% of the total hospital capacity.Asymptomatic and mild Covid-19 cases in Delhi are lodged in home isolation after surveillance officers assess the homes of such patients and institute a monitoring mechanism. As of Saturday night, 12,611 Covid-19 patients were in home isolation, according to the official bulletin.On Saturday morning, Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said that a move to scrap home isolation for all cases would mean that the Capital needed 90,000 Covid-19-designated beds by June 30. The previous prediction was that Delhi needed 15,000 beds by June 30, the AAP’s national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said. “People in my assembly called me and told me that we will not get tested now. People are that scared… From where will we get these (additional) beds?” he said, hours before the order was rolled back.Later in the day, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal opposed Baijal’s order, asking why a separate rule was being applied for the city, according to people aware of the developments.A senior government official present at the meeting said the chief minister, through video-conferencing, told the LG that if institutional quarantine was made mandatory for all, there would be chaos in the city and the focus would shift from treating serious Covid-19 patients to finding additional facilities for asymptomatic ones, since they make up a high number.While a meeting of DDMA could not arrive at a consensus on the fate of the order earlier in the day, another round of discussions in the evening resulted in the home isolation strategy being restored.At the second meeting, the LG stated that since the government began intensive community-based rapid antigen testing, it was possible that individuals who were positive may have moderate to severe illness, necessitating hospitalisation, which can be missed if they remain under home isolation.Baijal said that if adequate facility for home isolation is found available with Covid-19 patients, and the people on clinical assessment do not require hospitalisation, then they would also be offered either a stay at CCCs or at paid isolation facilities such as hotels.“Those who are in home isolation should follow home isolation guidelines laid down by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and should stay in touch with health care providers so that if their condition deteriorates, they can be moved to the COVID hospitals. The earlier orders would be amended accordingly,” the LG office said.“To prevent this from happening, all individuals who are positive will be referred to the Covid Care Centers for assessment of clinical conditions, severity of illness and presence of co-morbidities. Simultaneously, physical assessment will also be done whether adequate facilities for home isolation like minimum two rooms and separate toilet exists so that the family members and neighbors are protected and a cluster of cases does not develop in that locality,” a statement by the LG’s office said.After the evening meeting, Sisodia tweeted: “The reservations of LG over home isolation were resolved in the SDMA meeting and the home isolation system will continue. We thank LG for this. Under the leadership of our Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, we will not let Delhi people have any inconvenience.”In a statement, the Delhi government said: “CM Kejriwal explained the Delhi government’s position to the LG and clarified all the doubts which the LG had about home isolation. We are thankful to the LG for amending his earlier order after considering all our points. A private agency was managing the home isolation programme of the Delhi government via tele-consultation in a professional manner. They were taking care of on-boarding the patient followed by their home-isolation training, medical counselling of patient and family and day-to-day tracking of symptoms. An emergency phone number was given to all patients in case of any escalation of symptoms. If the patients’ symptoms were severe, they were immediately shifted to a hospital. The LG has now asked the health department to make a detailed presentation and submit a concrete proposal to the DDMA on managing the entire process in-house or any other plans for the same before 12pm on Monday. Till then, the service of the said agency has been restored.” The DDMA order on Friday discontinued the services of the company hired to manage the home quarantine, Portea Medical, which contacted individuals through phone calls.According to the government’s June 20 bulletin, 6,285 of its 12,208 Covid-19 hospital beds were vacant, and 4,965 beds were available (out of 6,249) in Covid care and health centres.While issuing the original order, which was called arbitrary by the Delhi government, DDMA said that it feared “home isolation without physical contact to monitor the patients may be a reason for the increase in the spread of Covid-19 infections in Delhi”. Total infections reached 56,746 on Saturday.Home quarantine for patients has been approved by the Union government as an effective way to preserve health care infrastructure for future challenges, under certain guidelines.To be eligible for it, a Covid-19 patient must fulfil seven criteria, according to a Union health ministry circular issued on May 10. One, they should be clinically declared as mild or pre-symptomatic by a treating medical officer; two, they should have requisite facility at home to be self-isolated and for quarantining family contacts; three, a caregiver should be available for 24x7 care and should be in direct contact with a hospital; four, the caregiver and other family contacts should take hydroxychloroquine as a prophylaxis; five, the patient should download the Aarogya Setu app and keep it active at all times; six, they should monitor their health and regularly inform the status to designated surveillance officers; and seven, give a written undertaking that all these guidelines will be followed.On June 19, the health ministry reiterated these guidelines while writing to all states asking for their strict adherence and saying that some states were not following them in “letter and spirit”.The Delhi government’s home isolation management system was launched on May 8. The first 5,000 patients were onboarded in Delhi government’s home isolation system on May 26.According to experts, hospital beds should be kept aside only for serious patients needing specialised care. Most countries in the world recommend home isolation for mild cases. Experts also point to the risks of infections from crowded quarantine facilities.Experts also said that if all cases were to be admitted to institutional facilities in the Capital, the authorities would have to find additional doctors, nurses and health workers. HT reported on Wednesday that the plan to add 23,800 beds this month for Covid-19 patients will require roughly 2,000 doctors and 3,000 nursing staff. To add to the shortfall, several health care workers testing positive are going into quarantine on coming in direct contact with Covid-19 patients.On Friday, the announcement by the central government was criticised as “arbitrary” by the state government, which pointed out its success in running a home quarantine programme and the challenges that will come with adding “thousands of quarantine rooms and finding additional doctors and nurses and health workers” to manage these facilities.Saturday’s move was welcomed by residents and experts.Iqbal Singh Chahal, commissioner of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said: “A rollback was expected because in cities such as Mumbai and Delhi you need to have solutions that are localised… For the middle and upper middle class people, we give them choices of either opting for paid quarantine or observing home isolation. So, a one-size-fits-all rule cannot be enforced on the ground in reality.”Rajiv Kakria, member of the GK-I Residents’ Welfare Association, said that it was a welcome step. “I would still say that instead of mass open quarantine centres, the government must use facilities like hostels, dharamshalas or state guest houses, which have separate rooms and toilets for people to help them keep safe from exposure to severe infection… We have also written to the government regarding this,” said Kakria, also convener of the Save City Group, a collective of Delhi-NCR RWAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/order-on-institutional-isolation-for-all-covid-patients-scrapped/story-Q4xUXj18H0Vds3EMUagwVL.html
21-06-2020||India||Light rain in Delhi-NCR likely for next 3-4 days: IMD||Pre-monsoon showers brought relief from heat to many parts of Delhi-NCR on Saturday. It is likely to rain intermittently for the next three to four days following which monsoon is likely to arrive around June 24 or 25, India Meteorological Department said.The maximum temperature in Delhi today was 38 degree C compared to 41 degree C on FridayConditions are becoming favourable for advance of southwest monsoon into many parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh and some parts of Uttarakhand during June 22 and 23 and into entire Western Himalayan region, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, most parts of Punjab, remaining parts of Arabian Sea, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and some parts of Rajasthan during June 24 and 25, IMD said in its Saturday bulletin.The northern limit of monsoon (northern-most boundary up to which monsoon rains have advanced) continues to pass through Kandla, Ahmedabad in Gujarat; Indore, Raisen, Khajuraho in Madhya Pradesh and Fatehpur, Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh. There was a pause in monsoon advancement since June 16 but its likely to advance towards west UP now.“There is a western disturbance and there is a trough of low pressure running from central Pakistan to east central Bay of Bengal. There will be rain for the next few days in Delhi due to these two systems,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre, adding that monsoon arrival in Delhi can be announced when there is rain in all places (spatial continuity of rain).A trough at mean sea level is running from central Pakistan to eastcentral Bay of Bengal across south Punjab, Haryana, south Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, north coastal Odisha and northwest Bay of Bengal. There is also a cyclonic circulation over southeast Uttar Pradesh. Under the influence of these systems, widespread rainfall with heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely to continue over east and northeast India during next 4-5 days.Rainfall activity over plains of northwest India is likely to increase from June 23, IMD said. “There will be rain and cloudy skies over many parts of Delhi NCR for next 4 to 5 days,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.Monsoon rains over the country are at 28% excess; 7% excess in northeast; 6% excess in northwest India; 74% excess in central India and 11% excess in peninsular India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/light-rain-in-delhi-ncr-likely-for-next-3-4-days-imd/story-TLnBBHmRQTzi3ca0G5iBbP.html
21-06-2020||India||China-made drone from Pakistan carrying arms shot down in J-K||A China-made drone sent from Pakistan with arms and ammunition was shot down by the Border Security Force (BSF) along the International Border in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kathua district on Saturday, officials said. Troops were put on high alert after the BSF intelligence branch received inputs about the possible use of drone for ferrying arms and ammunition from Pakistan into the Indian side, according to officials.“At 5.10am, BSF shot down a China-made drone from Pakistan near Kathua and recovered, among others, M-4 US-made semi-automatic rifle, 60 rounds in two magazines and seven M67 grenades,” said NS Jamwal, inspector general, BSF Jammu Frontier.The drone (8 ft × 6.2 ft) having four batteries weighed around 17.5 kilograms and the consignment around five to six kilograms, Jamwal said. “Surely, it was an attempt to deliver the arms and ammunition to someone here on this side. Who was he, remains a matter of investigation,” he said.He added that the drone came from Thakurpora post in Narowal–Shakargarh sector in Pakistan. A senior police officer who did not want to be named said the delivery was for some “Ali Bhai” as the payload was carrying his name. Jamwal said the payload was for carrying out a big terror attack and “we feel that the contact was probably waiting on Indian side...”“This is the biggest achievement and averted a major incident… We are alert to the situation and keeping an eye on ‘aakash’ (sky), ‘zameen’ (land) and ‘paataal’ (subterranean) activities,” Jamwal, who rushed to the Hiranagar sector, told reporters. “It is a big challenge, but security forces are ready for it. We have had inputs that such hexacopters can be used for dropping arms and ammunition. Our jawans were already on alert and that’s why they shot it down immediately,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drone-from-pak-carrying-arms-shot-down/story-dCmWavDJVEhFc676Xb9JBN.html
21-06-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi says PM Modi surrendered Galwan Valley, Shah hits back||The war of words between the opposition and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the border standoff with China in the Galwan valley in eastern Ladakh escalated on Saturday with former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi alleging that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had surrendered Indian territory to Chinese aggression.Union Home Minister Amit Shah soon hit back at Gandhi, advising him to rise above “petty politics” and stand in solidarity with national interest at a time when the whole nation is united.Gandhi’s remarks came a day after the Prime Minister stated that no intruder remained in India’s territory nor had any of its posts been captured.“PM has surrendered Indian territory to Chinese aggression. If the land was Chinese: 1.Why were our soldiers killed? 2. Where were they killed?” he tweeted.Gandhi also tagged the Prime Minister’s remarks, made at Friday’s all-party meeting called to discuss the situation at the India-China border following violent clashes between troops of the two countries on June 15 in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.It was the first time since 1975 that India suffered combat fatalities in a skirmish with Chinese troops. Ten Indian soldiers detained by the Chinese side during the violent brawl of June 15 were later released after intense negotiations through diplomatic and military channels. China has so far not acknowledged any casualties among its troops.Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday hit back at former Congress president Rahul Gandhi over his statement on face-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers in Galwan Valley in Ladakh and advised him to rise above “petty politics”.Putting a video of the father of an injured army man on his Twitter account, Shah said, Gandhi should stand in solidarity with national interest by shunning his politics over the issue at a time when the whole nation is united.“A brave armyman’s father speaks and he has a very clear message for Mr Gandhi. At a time when the entire nation is united, Mr Rahul Gandhi should also rise above petty politics and stand in solidarity with national interest,” Shah tweeted.Later in the day, senior Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram asked the government to clarify its position on China’s claim on the entire Galwan Valley in Ladakh.“The Prime Minister’s remark that no outsider was inside Indian territory in Ladakh had practically left everyone baffled and bewildered,” he said.Addressing a virtual news conference, Chidambaram said the Prime Minister’s remarks contradicted the earlier statements of army chief General MM Naravane, defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar.He said even after the Prime Minister’s statement on Friday, China had blamed India for the June 15 clashes and had re-asserted its claim to the entire Galwan Valley.“What is the government’s answer to this claim? Now that China is claiming the entire Galwan Valley, will the government of India reject this claim? If it does not reject the Chinese claim today, it can have terrible consequences,” the Congress leader said.“Let the government of India answer China’s claim today and not wait till tomorrow,” he added.A day after India rejected the Chinese army’s claim of sovereignty over the Galwan Valley and asked Beijing to confine its activities to its side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), China’s foreign ministry on Friday claimed that the Galwan Valley was on the Chinese side of the LAC.Asked whether the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government was drawing a parallel between India’s China policy in 1962, the year the neighbours fought a war over the border dispute, and now, Chidambaram said, “We must focus on the present and not talk about the past.”Chidambaram also reiterated Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s statement at the all-party meeting, insisting that the party stood by India’s defence forces and was prepared to make any sacrifice to ensure they are battle-ready.He said if the Prime Minister’s statement reflects the correct position, the Congress would like to ask the government a few questions.“If no Chinese troops had crossed the LAC and are in Indian territory, what was the face-off on May 5-6, 2020? Between May 5 and June 6, what was the issue on which local Indian commanders were talking to their Chinese counterparts {about} ? What was the subject matter of the negotiations between the Corps Commanders of the two countries on June 6?” asked Chidambaram.“We would also like to ask, if no Chinese troops were inside Indian territory, where did the clashes take place on June 15-16? Where were 20 Indian soldiers killed and 85 injured?” he further asked.Chidambaram also said, “If no Chinese troops are in Indian territory, why did the foreign minister’s statement and other statements of MEA demand the restoration of status quo ante? What was the meaning of status quo ante? What was the meaning of the disengagement that the government said was underway?”If no Chinese forces were inside Indian territory in Ladakh, why did 20 soldiers have to sacrifice their lives, he asked.“When the Prime Minister said a few days ago that the sacrifice of our soldiers will not go in vain, what did he have in mind?” asked the Congress leader.“Why and where did the soldiers sacrifice their lives, and how will the government ensure that the sacrifice will not be in vain?” he asked.Chidambaram said the defence of the nation and its territorial integrity were dear to the heart of every Indian. “We, therefore, seek answers to the questions with a view to re-double our commitment and present a picture of unity and solidarity,” he added.On the call to boycott Chinese products, Chidambaram said that will not hurt China’s economy as Chinese trade with India was only a fraction of its world trade.“We must become self-reliant as much as possible but we can’t decouple with the rest of the world. India must continue to be part of the global supply chain and not boycott Chinese goods. What part of Chinese trade with India is China’s world trade? It’s a fraction,” he said.BJP chief JP Nadda also hit out at the Congress, alleging that its leaders were demoralising the Indian army.“When we are fighting in Galwan, a leader is damaging the morale of forces with his tweets. He is showing his limited intellect,” he said, addressing a virtual rally in Rajasthan.“(He is asking) why have our forces gone unarmed. Don’t you know international treaties? And they didn’t go unarmed. Why are you exposing your limited intellect?” Nadda asked.He said India’s defence forces were capable of protecting its borders everywhere -- ocean, land or sky.Samajwadi Party president and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav said while the nation stands with the government the people must be told the truth about the Galwan Valley clash.“The nation stands with the govt against Chinese incursions. But was the incident in which our soldiers were martyred an incursion? If not then why did MEA ask for status quo ante? Is the Galwan Valley Indian or not? We do not need clarifications. We need the truth,” he tweeted.In a tweet in Hindi earlier in the day, Yadav said, “Confused by Prime Minister ji’s statement on India-China LAC, people are asking if China had not intruded into our territory then under what circumstances did our soldiers die? Is China being given a clean chit?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-says-pm-surrendered-galwan-valley-shah-hits-back/story-tkfG5sd6nTFlgGgp6TeQfO.html
21-06-2020||India||India rejects China’s Galwan Valley claim||New Delhi: India again rejected on Saturday China’s claim on Galwan Valley in Ladakh and reiterated the violent clash of June 15 was triggered by Chinese efforts to build structures on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The external affairs ministry dismissed claims made by China’s foreign ministry in a statement issued late on Friday night regarding both sovereignty over Galwan Valley and the genesis of the clash on Monday night that left 20 Indian soldiers dead.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the position with regard to Galwan Valley was “historically clear”. He added, “Attempts by the Chinese side to now advance exaggerated and untenable claims with regard to Line of Actual Control (LAC) there are not acceptable. They are not in accordance with China’s own position in the past.”Srivastava further said that the brawl of June 15 was the result of “violent actions” by Chinese troops after they were prevented by Indian soldiers from building structures on the Indian side of the LAC. He noted senior military commanders of the two sides had agreed during a meeting on June 6 on a process for de-escalation and disengagement along the LAC that “involved reciprocal actions”.“Both sides had agreed to respect and abide by the LAC and not undertake any activity to alter the status quo. However, the Chinese side departed from these understandings in respect of the LAC in the Galwan Valley area and sought to erect structures just across the LAC. When this attempt was foiled, Chinese troops took violent actions on June 15, 2020 that directly resulted in casualties,” he said.People familiar with developments said the term “just across the LAC” meant an intrusion into the Indian side of the disputed border but not at great depth.During his phone conversation with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on June 17, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had conveyed India’s strong protest on “the events leading up to and on the violent face-off” on June 15. “He firmly rejected the unfounded allegations made by the Chinese side and the misrepresentation of the understandings reached between the senior [military] commanders. [Jaishankar] also underlined that it was for China to reassess its actions and take corrective steps,” Srivastava said.The two ministers agreed the overall situation would be “handled in a responsible manner” and both sides would “sincerely” implement the disengagement understanding of June 6.Srivastava said the two sides are in regular touch and early meetings of military and diplomatic mechanisms are currently being discussed. “We expect that the Chinese side will sincerely follow the understanding reached between the foreign ministers to ensure peace and tranquillity in the border areas, which is so essential for the overall development of our bilateral relations,” he added.The spokesperson reiterated that Indian troops scrupulously abide by the alignment of the LAC in all sectors, including in Galwan Valley, and the Indian side has “never undertaken any actions across the LAC”. He added Indian troops “have been patrolling” Galwan Valley for a long time without any incident and all infrastructure built by the Indian side is on its side of the LAC.However, Srivastava said that since early May, the Chinese side had hindered India’s normal and traditional patrolling pattern in Galwan Valley and this resulted in a face-off that was addressed by ground commanders in line with bilateral agreements and protocols. “We do not accept the contention that India was unilaterally changing the status quo. On the contrary, we were maintaining it,” he said.In mid-May, the Chinese side “attempted to transgress the LAC in other areas of the Western Sector” of border areas and these attempts were “invariably met with an appropriate response” from the Indian side. The two sides then engaged in discussions through diplomatic and military channels to address the situation.Late on Friday, China claimed Galwan Valley was on the Chinese side of the LAC and had been patrolled by its troops for “many years”. The claim was made in what was described as a “step by step account of the Galwan clash” by Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian.China’s People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) western command had in a statement issued on Tuesday initially claimed the region, saying: “The sovereignty of the Galwan River Valley has always been ours.”On Thursday, Srivastava had dismissed the PLA’s claim as “exaggerated and untenable”.The so-called “step by step account” by Zhao had further claimed that since April, Indian troops had “unilaterally and continuously built roads, bridges and other facilities at the LAC in the Galwan Valley”. He added that “India has gone even further to cross the LAC and make provocations”.Zhao claimed that on June 15, Indian troops “once again crossed the Line of Actual Control for deliberate provocation…and even violently attacked the Chinese officers and soldiers who went there for negotiation, thus triggering fierce physical conflicts and causing casualties”.Air Vice Marshal (retired) Manmohan Bahadur, additional director general of the Centre for Air Power Studies and a helicopter pilot with extensive experience of operations along the LAC, said: “When I first flew in that area in 1978, the maps clearly showed the Galwan Valley as Indian territory. The LAC was well east of the confluence of the Shyok and Galwan rivers.“There was never any question about the Galwan Valley and China’s claim on this region is untenable. There was no Chinese activity in the area, or we would have been briefed accordingly. It was well inside our side of the LAC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-china-s-galwan-valley-claim/story-VofgMqtd74btXuHB2OGTWI.html
21-06-2020||India||Plea in SC against Rath Yatra order||Janardhan Pattajoshi Mohapatra, the hereditary chief servitor of Lord Jagannatha of the Jagannatha Temple in Puri, moved the Supreme Court on Friday seeking the recall of the top court’s June 18 order which had barred the holding of the annual Hindu festival of Rath Yatra this year in view of the threat posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.Mohapatra submitted that the Rath Yatra is an unbroken tradition and an essential practice of the Jagannatha temple, which the temple administrators should mandatorily observe in all circumstances.“Any interruption in the observance of this mandatory religious practice affects the very sanctity of the temple and all its future rituals, as well as the faith of millions of devotees across the world who understand and revere the significance of the Rath Yatra,” the application stated.Mohapatra, therefore, suggested that instead of imposing a blanket ban on the Rath Yatra, and the festival and rituals associated with it, they could hold the festival without public participation by imposing a curfew in the city of Puri and closing its borders.“If a curfew is imposed on the day of Rath Yatra and the Rathas are pulled with the help of earth movers, the entire journey of Lord Jagannatha from the Shri Jagannath Temple to Gundicha mandir of around 2.8 km can be completed in less than one hour. An absolute bar on the performance of such an essential ritual is not necessary to protect public health,” the application filed through advocate Suvidutt Sundaram stated.The Rath Yatra is a festival associated with Lord Jagannatha. It was scheduled to commence this year on June 23. The festival lasts for 10 to 12 days and involves a procession of chariots containing the statues of the deity Lord Jagannatha, his brother Lord Balabhadra and sister Devi Subhadra.The Supreme Court had ordered a stay on the festival and all activities associated with it this year stating that allowing the same would lead to a congregation of more than 10 lakh devotees in violation of social distancing norms which could compromise public health and safety.This order was passed in a petition filed by an NGO, Odisha Vikas Parishad which had moved the top court pointing out the public health risk involved if the annual event took place.The NGO referred to the Tablighi Jamaat incident, a Muslim religious congregation held in mid-March in Nizamuddin, New Delhi, which resulted in a spurt of Covid-189 cases across the country after people from various parts of India and even foreign countries attended the event.“Of about 4,400 Covid-19 positive cases in India as on April 7, nearly one-third were related to the religious gathering at the Markaz, Delhi. Thus, in order to avoid any similar instances of outbreak of Covid-19 cases, a religious gathering in the nature of Rath Yatra festival ought to be avoided,” the petition had read.“Regarding the danger presented by such a large gathering of people for the Rath Yatra, we consider it appropriate in the interests of public health and safety of citizens who are devotees to restrain the respondents (state and district authorities and managing committee of Jagannatha temple) from holding the Rath Yatra this year,” the bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde had ordered.The court had also directed that no such Rath Yatra should be allowed in any other part of Odisha.Mohapatra pointed out that the Rath Yatra has been conducted in all circumstances, including during the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918.“The Rath Yatra is an essential, mandatory, integral and indispensable religious practice which has scriptural sanction. Non-conduct of the Rath Yatra has consequences not only for the sanctity of the temple but also for the society in general,” his application read.He, therefore, suggested that the state government may announce that the Rath Yatra will be conducted with absolutely nil participation from the public and strict penal consequences will follow if any attempt is made to enter Puri during the Rath Yatra.“Arrangements for the live broadcast of the Rath Yatra may be allowed like every year to enable crores of devotees across the world, including the residents of Puri, to have darshan of the three Deities”, the plea read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-sc-against-rath-yatra-order/story-AWanHxPjw22OIuIylSsq4L.html
21-06-2020||India||Soldiers exchanged after melee: Singh||Former chief of army staff VK Singh, minister of state for road transport and highways in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, says the latest transgression by China across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) into Indian territory has created a trust deficit between the two Asian giants, but cautions that war should be the last resort. Asked what would be an apt response to the Chinese aggression, which led to a violent brawl on June 15 in the Gwalan valley in eastern Ladakh that left 20 Indian soldiers dead, Singh said in an interview: “If you’re going to tell about the response now, then the response is of no use whatsoever. I am sure the required people have been tasked to think of what can be done, what cannot be done and what all measures have to be taken.” “In the melee where there are over 600 people just jostling, scuffling, pushing and hitting each other and in a dark night some people got separated; their people on our side and our people on their side. But in the morning they were exchanged.” Singh added: “The first thing that has been given out is to boycott Chinese goods, let’s start with this. Let’s hurt them economically, other things will follow. War and use of force is the last resort always and every time. When all other means fail then you resort to this. There are many means available.” Singh’s comments come in the backdrop of outrage over the June 15 skirmish, in which Chinese troops armed with nail-studded rods and clubs attacked Indian troops. The 20 Indians who died were the first fatalities in a confrontation with Chinese troops in 45 years. The former army chief said the situation was firmly in control of Indian troops. “There are no intrusions. There are transgressions, not intrusions,” he said.On the May confrontation in Pangong Tso, he said: “ ... this is not just a yearly feature, but happens in the summer and sometimes in the winter also. These have been happening, the only difference this time is that the transgression has involved a certain amount of stealth in the Pangong Tso area, they’ve done things which they have never done earlier.”Singh said subsequent negotiations centred on wherever there have been transgressions such as Patrol Point 14 where “they said LAC is not this way but is a different way.”“They have been told that we been sitting here on this for decades now, where is the doubt?. Same is true for other regions including Chumar. They try and come to the heights opposite the DBO [Daulat Begh Oldi]. All this is very old, it’s not something which is new. What is new is as the infrastructure becomes better they try to overawe us by more strength or vehicles.”Singh said the Chinese were not on Indian territory across the LAC, asked about China laying claim to Galwan.“The LAC is an interpretation from a map given in 1959 and Chinese keep advancing some claim or the other. The LAC is not marked on the ground, there is no agreement on it. There is a certain amount of flexibility that exists out there. But there are places where both sides know their own sides and ensure these are protected. Where there is no-man’s land, which comes up because of these perceptional differences, is where these patrol face-offs take place,” he added.Asked about Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s question at the all-party meeting with the PM on Friday if here had been an intelligence failure, Singh said::”I am not in a position to respond because intelligence is a domain that is looked after by the RA&W {Research and Analysis Wing}. What I can refute is that it is a military intelligence failure...” Singh said the Chinese aggression across the LAC may be an attempt to deflect attention from other issues.“Why would China try to do things on the border, it is there any reason? In China nothing happens at the local level, it all comes from the top and who is the head of the military commission, {President} Xi Jinping. So this is not like India where broad instructions are there and commanders do their own things. What is it that they want to divert attention from? They are in the firing line of all the countries in the world because of Covid, they are having problems in Hong Kong, they hav problems in the South China Sea, they have trade problems with the United States, everybody is blaming them for everything. It means they want to divert attention from something.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soldiers-exchanged-after-melee-singh/story-paLMC5nLvV33MIHYJO50YP.html

21-06-2020||India||School principal arrested in Delhi violence case gets bail||A Delhi court on Saturday granted bail to Faisal Farooq, principal of Rajdhani Public School, who was earlier charged with hatching a conspiracy to precipitate and aggravate riots in and around his school. The court observed that the CCTV footage did not show Farooq’s presence at the place where the riots had broken out. Duty Judge Vinod Yadav said that the statement of one of the witnesses, Roop Singh, on March 8 had claimed that he had seen Farooq on the spot . He had also claimed to have heard Farooq asking the school guard to permit some people inside the school.However, later in his statement recorded before the magistrate on March 11, he did not say a word about having seen the accused at the scene or having heard him saying anything to the school guard.The court, while granting bail, said that to “cover up” the deficiency in statement of the witness, the Investigating Officer (IO) recorded a supplementary statement of Singh claiming that he had got scared before magistrate which is why he could not state the correct facts. The IO had moved an application before the court for getting this new fact added to his statement. However, it was dismissed by the judge, the court noted in its order.“It is clearly apparent that there are contradictions in the various statements of this witness about applicant,” the court said. It also noted that Farooq kept calling the police to report the damage to his school (Rajdhani Public School) from February 24, but FIR in his case was not recorded and it was ultimately recorded on March 5.The court also said that another witness, Geeta, who was Roop Singh’s wife, also did not say a word about having seen the accused on the spot on the date of the incident. It said that another witness Manoj, who was admittedly the guard at the Rajdhani school, has merely stated that Farooq had come to the main gate and had spoken to some people outside.“From the aforesaid statements, it is prima-facie not established that the applicant was present at the spot at the time of incident. It is an admitted position that several CCTV cameras were lying installed at Rajdhani Public School at various places, the footages whereof have been thoroughly scrutinized by the Investigating Agency but the presence of the applicant therein is not there. If the applicant (Farooq) was not present at the scene of occurrence then his involvement in the offences cannot be made out,” the judge in his order.The court also noted that “except bald allegation,” there is no material to substantiate that Farooq had spoken to several people related to communal riots.“When the IO was confronted in this regard then he stated that further investigation on the aspect of terror funding is under way.....,” the court said.The court, while stating that the accused had made a good case for bail, also noted, “It is made clear that nothing in this order shall be construed an expression on the merits of evidence to be adduced in the matter.”The police also charge sheeted 18 people in connection with the riots that broke out at Rajdhani Public School, while naming its principal, Farooq ,for hatching a conspiracy to precipitate and aggravate riots, in and around the school. According to the police, it was on Farooq’s directions that the adjacent and rival convent school, two parking lots run by the other party and the building of one Anil Sweets were systematically destroyed by the mob.Police said in the charge sheet that the call detail analysis of Farooq’s phone suggested that the he had links with prominent members of Popular Front of India, Pinjra Tod group, Jamia Coordination Committee, Hazrat Nizamuddin Markaz and some other fundamental muslim clerics, including Deoband, which indicated the depth of the conspiracy.Police in a charge sheet have said that the rioters had camped inside and fired bullets from the terrace of Rajdhani School. They also threw petrol bombs, acid, bricks, stones and other missiles using an improvised large iron catapult, specially installed for the purpose, from the terrace of the school. HT contacted police crime branch chief Praveer Ranjan and police spokesperson Mandeep Randhawa but despite many calls and text message, there was no response. Confirming the order, Farooq’s lawyer Gaurav Kochar said he had contended that there was no material on record about the physical presence of the applicant at the spot at the time of riots. He also told the court that there was a delay of 11 days in the registration of FIR in the matter which was unexplained and pointed towards concoction of the false implication in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/school-principal-arrested-in-delhi-violence-case-gets-bail/story-BUADUKjsLzfSpilDYd4gBJ.html
21-06-2020||India||2 China-bound flights to bring back Indians||India has arranged two flights to bring back Indians stranded in China because of the Covid-19 pandemic in the third phase of Vande Bharat Mission, against the backdrop of heightened tensions between the two sides over a border standoff.There will be close to 600 flights in the third phase of Vande Bharat Mission, the country’s largest operation to repatriate its nationals from around the world. Several hundred Indians were evacuated from China, including Wuhan, in special flights shortly after the Covid-19 outbreak, though China wasn’t included in the first two phases of the repatriation programme.The first flight to China under the third phase was scheduled for 10pm on June 20 from Shanghai to Delhi and the second for 10.40am on June 29 from Guangzhou to Delhi. The flights are expected to repatriate a total of almost 490 Indian nationals, according to a schedule on the external affair ministry’s website.Tensions between and India and China spiked after a violent face-off between border troops of the two sides at Galwan Valley along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on June 15 left 20 Indian soldiers dead. India has said the violence occurred when Indian soldiers foiled attempts by Chinese troops to erect structures after transgressing the LAC.More than 50,000 Indians were living and working in mainland China as of early 2019.The third phase of Vande Bharat Mission, which started on June 11, will cover 41 countries and involve flights operating from 55 international airports. So far, more than 250,000 Indians have returned under the programme and 21% of them were migrant workers.Besides flights by state-run Air India, chartered flight operations under Vande Bharat Mission began on May 26. More than 57,000 Indian nationals have returned on chartered flights.More than 75,000 Indians have returned through land border immigration checkpoints from Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh.About 450,000 Indians have registered with Indian missions abroad for repatriation to India on compelling grounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-china-bound-flights-to-bring-back-indians/story-sweuwQ5OrdZei6QVOrxrgI.html
21-06-2020||India||DU admissions begin, over 19k register online on Day 1||New Delhi: Over 19,500 applicants had registered for admissions to Delhi University’s various undergraduate courses in just about four hours as the admissions began on Saturday. While 19,543 applicants had registered online for the undergraduate courses, 5,889 registered for postgraduate courses and 457 registered for PhD, university officials said. DU on Saturday started the online registration process for admission to its various undergraduate, postgraduate, Mphil, and PhD courses. Applicants will get a two-week window ending on July 4 to register for the courses.The Bulletin of Information, which contains guidelines on university’s admission procedure, was uploaded on the DU website at around 5pm and the registration portal was also made operational for applicants.In 2019, applicants got an over three-week window from May 30 to June 22 to register for admissions and the first cut-off list was announced on June 28. This year, however, the Covid-19 pandemic has delayed the admission schedule. The dates of the first cut-off are yet to be decided as the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is yet to conduct its twelve main class 12 papers. The exams are due to be held between July 1 and 15. (Multiple papers were pending for CBSE. But on April 1 CBSE said it would conduct the remaining exams in only major subjects for class 12 including Business Studies and Computer Studies.)Dean (admissions) Shobha Bagai said on Satuday that the admission process this time will be “contact-less” and completely online. “We have a link with the CBSE portal to directly verify the marksheets online. This time, we have also written to all educational boards across the country to share the link of the portal where their results will be announced so that colleges can easily verify the marksheets,” she said at a press conference. “The University had been planning the complete online admission for quite some time but the Covid-19 pandemic catalyzed the process,” she added.Applicants in previous years could visit the university and colleges to clarify their doubts or follow the admission procedures through Open Day events. This year, DU will instead conduct webinars in the coming days to clear up any doubts applicants have. “We will have dedicated helpline numbers where students can post in their queries. We will also be conducting webinars guiding students through the process,” Bagai said.Unlike last year, candidates opting for Bachelor of Arts courses will not undergo a percentage deduction if they switch from science or commerce streams. No additional eligibility criteria will be set by the colleges besides the ones stipulated in the Bulletin of Information, the document read.This is also the first time that trials for sports and extracurricular activities(ECA) will not be held due to the pandemic. While students will get admission under the sports category on the basis of their certificates, for ECA, only NSS and NCC certificates will be considered instead of 14 activities such as music, dance and debate among others listed till last year.While the bulletin mentions that there will be five cut-offs for students, the admissions committee is yet to release the tentative schedule for the first cut-off. Bagai explained that this is due to the uncertainty over CBSE results. “Earlier we were told that the CBSE results were likely to come around August 15 after they conducted their pending class 12 exams. Since the Supreme Court has asked CBSE to look for other alternatives, there is a possibility that the results might be declared sooner. We will release our tentative schedule by the second or third week of July when things are clearer,” she said.The National Testing Agency (NTA) will be conducting the entrance tests to undergraduate and postgraduate courses in DU in 20 cities across India and the schedule will be released in the coming days.Hours after it went live, some students faced issues in accessing the website. “On the very first day of admissions, the website for UG admissions wasn’t working. DU is planning on holding its first ever online open book examination after 10 days. But it has failed terribly in making an efficient and secure online infrastructure for even filling admission forms,” said Akshay Lakra, president of the Delhi unit of National Students’ Union of India (NSUI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/du-admissions-begin-over-19k-register-online-on-day-1/story-lArm85psEbgQ8kErV6XhWN.html
21-06-2020||India||Chinese app pulls down India’s posts on conflict||BeijingChinese social media app, WeChat, has removed posts of the Embassy of India (EoI) regarding the India-China border conflict.It has cited “endangering national security” and “divulging state secrets” as the reasons for the removal of the posts.The EoI posts included Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks on the India-China border situation, details of a phone call between the Indian and Chinese foreign ministers held on Thursday and a statement by the external affairs ministry (MEA) spokesperson.For two of the posts, a pop-up window said that the posts were “deleted by the author”. For the third post, which was a statement by the MEA spokesperson, the pop-up message read: “Unable to view this content because it violates regulations”. “This content was reported and confirmed by the platform of the following…Suspected of violating relevant laws, regulations and policies,” the message added.The regulations included: “endangers national security, divulges state secrets, subverts state power, or undermines national unity, inciting hatred, disseminating false information, inciting illegal assembly, demonstration or gathering of people to disturb public order”. This has come a day after a similar statement by the MEA spokesperson was deleted from the Embassy’s Weibo account. The Embassy had then issued a clarification saying that the post wasn’t removed by it, and re-published a screen-shot of the statement in Chinese.Weibo is a Chinese microblogging website.While the statements on WeChat were issued in English and Mandarin, the EoI’s Weibo account uploaded the MEA’s version of the events at the border in eastern Ladakh, in Chinese.WeChat is yet to respond to queries from HT on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-app-pulls-down-india-s-posts-on-conflict/story-hONzMbOLQOEMp8lPGCb61H.html
21-06-2020||India||Fully prepared for any contingency, says air force chief||Hyderabad India is not expecting a war with China on the border issue, but it is fully prepared to meet any contingency arising out of the conflict on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said in Hyderabad on Saturday.The Indian Air Force (IAF) chief said India will always be prepared to defend its territories. His remarks came against the backdrop of the biggest confrontation with China in over five decades in which 20 soldiers, including a colonel, were killed in the Galwan valley on June 15.“It should be very clear that we are well-prepared and suitably deployed to respond to any contingency. I assure the nation that we are determined to deliver and will never let the sacrifice of our braves of Galwan go in vain,” he said, addressing 123 newly graduated IAF cadets, including 19 women cadets, at the Air Force Academy at Dundigal on the outskirts of Hyderabad.He also interacted with reporters after reviewing the combined graduation parade. Bhadauria said the air force, for tactical reasons, cannot disclose where and how the deployments will be made. “We shall do and we are doing it as per the requirements,” he said. “We know what their (Chinese) fields are. We know what their air fields are, where they are deployed, what are the operational bases,” he added.Replying to a query on his assessment of the LAC situation in the wake of his visit to the airbases in Leh and Srinagar over the last two days, the Air Chief Marshal said the army was in full control of the situation at Galwan valley. “We are aware of the full situation. Be at LAC (Line of Actual Control), be it deployments beyond LAC,” Bhadauria said. When asked if India is at war with China, Bhadauria said: “You are aware of the talks that are happening at the military level...but we are prepared for any contingency.”Answering another question, Bhadauria admitted that the air force was yet to acquire full capacity in indigenous production of fighter aircraft. “However, we are developing the ecosystem for indigenous manufacturing. We hope to produce 300 plus aircraft in the next 15 years,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fully-prepared-for-any-contingency-says-air-force-chief/story-HtxQL7IE83v71IpmC6E5iP.html
21-06-2020||India||Glenmark plans to launch antiviral drug for Covid-19 in next few days||Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited plans to launch its anti-viral drug Favipiravir, which produced improvement of up to 88% in mild to moderate coronavirus disease cases during clinical trials, across India by early next week, the company said on Saturday, making it the first oral antiviral available under emergency use authorisation to treat Covid-19 patients in the country.The drug, marketed under the brand name FabiFlu, will be marketed in some north Indian states by Saturday evening. Available in a pack of 34 oral tables of 200mg each for Rs 3,500, the cost of the 14-day treatment will be around Rs 14,000.The dosage regimen is 3,600 mg on day one, and 1,600 mg from day two onwards for a maximum 14 days.Emergency use means every patient must give his or her informed consent before starting treatment.“The company has already started production of the drug. In some states that are closer to our manufacturing unit in Baddi (Himachal) the drug will be rolled out by this (Saturday) evening, and across India we should be able to supply by early next week,” said Sujesh Vasudevan, president, India formulations, Middle East and Africa, at Glenmark.On Friday, the company had announced it received approval from India’s central drugs regulator for manufacturing and marketing FabiFlu as an oral antiviral drug to treat mild to moderate Covid-19 cases in India.The drug that has been indigenously manufactured will be available for sale both in hospitals and retail pharmacies, and is to be given under strict medical supervision. It is not an over-the-counter drug, and its sale will only be allowed on possession of a valid medical prescription. “The antiviral offers broad spectrum RNA virus coverage with clinical improvement noted across age groups 20 to >90 years. Favipiravir can be used in Covid-19 patients with comorbid conditions such as diabetes and heart disease with mild to moderate Covid-19 symptoms. It offers rapid reduction in viral load within four days, and provides faster symptomatic and radiological improvement. Of most importance, Favipiravir has shown clinical improvement of up to 88% in Covid-19 mild to moderate cases,” the company said in a presentation at a press briefing.The drug needs to be started early for it to show maximum benefits. “Antivirals work the best when they are started early, same is the case with Favipiravir. The evidence shows it will prevent patients from progressing to severe disease, and turning critical if the drug is administered in early stages of the disease when flu-like symptoms appear in mild cases, or when lung infection sets in in moderate cases,” said Monika Tandon, vice president and head, clinical development, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals.Randomised clinical trials in India have been conducted in 150 covid-19 patients at 11 hospitals, who were diagnosed positive through a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Of them, 90 were mild cases and 60 were moderately sick patients.“The Indian study as well as the other global studies point to the fact that the drug leads to rapid reduction in viral load, faster fever reduction, faster resolution of chest CT changes and faster clinical recovery,” said Tandon.The medicine, however, is not recommended for people suffering from severe kidney or liver disease, pregnant and lactating women, and also those sensitive to Favipiravir.The company’s priority is the Indian market, but it is also exploring the possibility of exporting the drug.“Our priority remains India and later other markets. Exports will depend on regulatory requirements in those countries. There is a possibility for export in Middle Eastern countries but it’s too early to say anything conclusively right now,” said Vasudevan.Currently, the injectible antiviral Remdesivir and immunosuppressant Tocilizumab are part of India’s treatment protocol, under restricted and off-label use, for Covid-19 patients.Experts in the field find the study results promising, “The initial data looks promising, and we will get to see how well it works once we start using it,” said a senior doctor treating Covid-19 patients in a private hospital on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/glenmark-plans-to-launch-antiviral-drug-for-covid-19-in-next-few-days/story-dgpWTQkhb5kgoZoqDTIkhL.html
21-06-2020||India||Pompeo says China ‘rogue actor’ in region||Washington: US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has blamed China for escalating tensions along the border with India and called it a “rogue actor” in the neighbourhood, and indicated he may have raised the dispute and other such flashpoints in his meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, earlier in the week.“The PLA has escalated border tensions – we see it today in India, the world’s most popular – populous democracy,” Pompeo said referring to the People’s Liberation Army, the Chinese military. “And we watch as it militarises the South China Sea and illegally claims more territory there, threatening vital sea lanes, a promise they broke again”“But the CCP isn’t just a rogue actor in its own neighbourhood,” he added, referring this time to the Chinese Communist Party by its initials. “If it was, we might think differently about it. It impacts us all. “The top US diplomat was participating in a virtual conference of the Copenhagen Democracy Summit on Friday.Pompeo went on to say, in response to a question about his meeting with Yang, “What I spent a good deal of my time speaking with Yang Jiechi about was the fundamental idea that we’re just watching actions. It’s no longer enough to listen to what the Chinese Communist Party is saying. We can see their actions. I ticked through a few of them: Hong Kong, Tibet, Xinjiang, what they’re doing in India, what they’ve done in the economic zones along the Philippines and Malaysia and Indonesia and Vietnam, the coercion on Australia – when they had the audacity to demand that there would be an investigation of how this virus got from Wuhan to Milan, how this virus got from Wuhan to Tehran, how this virus got from Wuhan to Oklahoma City, and to Belgium and to Spain, and decimating the global economy.”The readout issued of the meeting by the state department had did not have such granular details. But, again, it was not explicit from Pompeo’s remarks at the virtual conference if he did indeed bring up the India-China border clashes specifically or in a general way, covering all of China’s aggressive actions.Tensions between the United States and China have escalated significantly after the Covid-19 outbreak,. The Trump administration has sought to tie to China accusing it of not alerting the rest of the world on time and then by providing incorrect and misleading information about it. Pompeo calls it the Wuhan Virus, after the city where it started. And President Donald Trump had called the “Chinese Virus”, “plague” and “gift” from China.There is very little patience for China in the United States, which made very clear its support for India in the ongoing border dispute with India form the early days. In May, Alice Wells, the former top diplomat for South and Central Asia had said the border flare-ups “were reminder that Chinese aggression is not always just rhetorical. We continue to see provocations and disturbing behaviour by China that raises questions about how China wants to use its rising power”.President Trump had offered to mediate subsequently, late May, but was turned down by both India and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pompeo-says-china-rogue-actor-in-region/story-hmLkWo9F3UIvVI5qLrC3kO.html
21-06-2020||India||Cancer care takes a hit during lockdown||Cancer treatment took a massive hit in April and May, when roughly 70% of patients could not access life-saving surgery and treatment, according to data from some of India’s largest super-speciality hospitals.Cancer surgeries in April and May in the aftermath of the lockdown enforced from March 25 to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease pandemic were one-fifth the surgeries performed in the corresponding period in 2019. Cancer services declined by 50% in April and May compared to the same period last year, shows data from leading private hospitals for cancer across India.Even after the lockdown was relaxed gradually, the fear of Covid-19 infection is keeping some cancer patients away from hospitals. Those who seek treatment don’t get it because of health systems prioritising coronavirus disease treatment over all else, leading to life-threatening delays in diagnosis and treatment.In February, a 52-year-old man who requested anonymity developed a small swelling on the left side of his neck, but it took six hospital visits and two-and-a-half months for him to be diagnosed with cancer. By the time his treatment began at Max Super Specialty Hospital at Saket in New Delhi in June, his tumour was oozing blood and he had lost 10kg, which brought his weight down to 61kg. “Most hospitals turned us away saying they did not have beds free. Two hospitals said no to dressing my wound because by the end of May, I had developed fever before I was diagnosed with lymphoma,” the patient said after undergoing a second round of chemotherapy at the hospital on June 18.At least 51,100 live-saving cancer surgeries were cancelled in India from the end of March to the end of May, estimated CovidSurg Collaborative, a research network of surgeons and anaesthetists in 77 countries, including India, which published its findings in the British Journal of Surgery in May.“Cancer patients are among the most vulnerable as they need early diagnosis and uninterrupted and often hospital-centric treatment for good outcomes to prevent high morbidity and mortality. He arrived here with a more than 10cm lymphoma, which is cancer in infection-fighting cells of the immune system. A colleague’s father was diagnosed with lung cancer on March 20, but missed treatment for two-and-a-half months. Now his lung cancer is at an advanced stage,” said Dr Harit Chaturvedi, chairman, cancer care, and director and chief surgical oncologist at Max Healthcare.One out of eight men and one in nine women in India has probability of developing cancer in their lifetime (0-74 years), according to the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (ICMR-NCDIR), Bangaluru, which implements India’s national cancer registry programme through 36 population-based registries and 236 hospital-based registries across states. It estimated there were 1.45 million new cases of cancer diagnosed in 2016, which will double in the next 20 years.Cancer killed 813,000 people in 2016 and accounted for 8.3% of total deaths in India that year, according to the ICMR-led India State-level Disease Burden Initiative study on cancer published in the journal The Lancet Oncology in 2018.“There is preliminary evidence that cancer surgeries and treatment have reduced post lockdown, but the national registry will have mature date on the impact of this disruption on cancer outcomes after a year, where we can analyse data systematically to say whether delays in treatment have increased death,” said Dr Prashant Mathur, director, ICMR-NCDIR.Children with cancer are particularly vulnerable. “Early results suggest that of the 10 children who would normally be expected to be diagnosed and treated for their cancer, six are no longer reaching that stage and hence missing on critical treatment, which will lead to significantly increased loss of life,” said Dr Ramandeep Singh Arora, paedicatric oncologist and principal investigator of an ongoing national study on the effect of Covid-19 on childhood cancers in India.Studies show that if patients get timely treatment, outcomes don’t get affected even in patients who develop cancer and Covid-19. A study published in The Lancet last week that analysed data from patients with Covid-19 and cancer in the UK and the US found the new coronavirus infection does not affect cancer treatment outcomes. The UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project prospectively collected data on 800 patients and found “no interaction between anticancer treatments within four weeks before testing positive for Sars-CoV-2, and Covid-19 morbidity or mortality was found”. The US Covid-19 and Cancer Consortium analysed prospectively collected data from 928 patients and found no increase in 30-day mortality associated with anti-cancer therapy.“In the beginning of the pandemic, all our resources were understandably directed there, but now there is an urgent need to strategise with a calm head. The government must not just restore all services for urgent treatments, emergency care and cancer, dialysis etc, but must also strengthen policies and communicate its initiatives to restore public confidence. We must deploy 50% of health care resources to Covid, and the rest to non-Covid {cases},” said Dr Chaturvedi.“Delayed treatment is likely to lead to cancer progression to late stages, so we need resume services as much as possible and also scale up remote access healthcare by using digital tools and WhatsApp video-calling to connect the provider and patients to decongest tertiary hospitals,” said Dr Mathur.Creating safe areas with no overcrowding and other safeguards will help reduce patient hesitancy. “To prevent any spread of infection have these buildings, hospitals blocks completely segregated. My fear is that if we do not take steps, we will see many times over loss of lives due to non-Covid reasons,” said Dr Chaturvedi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cancer-care-takes-a-hit-during-lockdown/story-9yIR9C2F6ZhRmyodjFdGRO.html

So far, 3,51,909 tests have been carried out in Delhi with the rate of testing now at 18,521 people per million of population.Earlier in the day, Delhi Lt Governor Anil Baijal withdrew his controversial order of mandatory five-day institutional quarantine for every Covid-19 case in the capital after stiff opposition from the AAP government which maintained that the mandatory institutional quarantine will seriously harm the city as its facilities will not be able to take the burden of the rising number of casesAs Covid-19 cases soared, the Delhi government directed all hospitals and medical institutions under it to recall their employees, who are currently on leave, and report for duty immediately. Leave of any kind would only be granted under “most compelling circumstances”.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Singh who is in an intensive care unit in a private hospital after testing positive for Covid-19, was administered plasma therapy on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-s-covid-19-tally-gallops-to-over-56k-after-highest-spike/story-Nqq0GDzrVbfqBhGGJOUgVN.html
21-06-2020||India||‘International flights to depend on demand’: Hardeep Singh Puri||A decision on the resumption of international passenger flights will depend on demand and other countries being open to receiving flights amid the Covid-19 pandemic, civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Saturday, and overseas operations to North America where demand is higher may be the first to restart, according to a senior official. At the same time, Puri was hopeful that domestic flights would reach full capacity by the end of the year.“Any suggestion that international air traffic has opened up in other countries and we are the only ones not to open up needs a reality check. The exact time we resume international flights depends on other countries being open to receive flights,” Puri said at a press conference on Saturday.India has suspended international passenger flights since March 22 in a bid to contain the spread of Covid-19.International flight movement in countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, China, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates now varies between 3% and 18% of their earlier flight capacity, Puri said.The minister said that international flight operations depend on airspaces being open and acceptance by destinations.“Many countries decided that they were not going to allow nationals from other countries except their own. We also went with the same position,” Puri said.He added that entry to the US, UK, France, China, UAE and Singapore was conditional. “We cannot have normal civil aviation operations under such conditions. We are left with no option but to continue with evacuation and repatriation flights under controlled conditions. We are constantly trying to expand both domestic and Vande Bharat flights {to bring back Indians stranded abroad} and eventually resuming flights to pre-Covid operational capacities,” he added.The minister added that nearly 275,000 stranded Indians have been brought back so far, adding that 109,000 Indians were brought back via Air India alone. During Phase 3 and Phase 4 of the Vande Bharat mission, private domestic airlines have been mandated to operate 750 international flights along with 300 Air India flights that will be added in the coming days, Puri said.India may resume international flights on routes with relatively higher demand first, other officials said. “Both ends have to be ready and there has to be traffic if international operations are to begin. There is a significant amount of traffic between India and the North American continent. We may think of opening flights on a case-to-case basis,” civil aviation secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola said.Puri said the government was ready to expand the capacity on domestic routes from 33% (at present) to 45% depending on the states.“At present we have allowed only 33% flights to operate. Flights are not operating with full capacity even now. We will open more routes when there is more demand. We are ready to take it to up to even 40-45% capacity,” Puri added.The limits on airfares imposed on domestic flights may also be extended beyond August 24, officials said.“Depending on how the situation turns out, the fare band may have to adjusted beyond that (August 24) also. But right now, it is only for three months,” Kharola said.The Centre capped airfares of domestic flights that resumed from May 25 with fixed lower and upper limits.Discussing the divestment plans for national carrier Air India, Puri said he was confident about the government’s plan of selling all its stake in the airline. “I have never been as hopeful and confident about Air India, divestment or disinvestment whatever you choose, as I am now. Air India is a first-class asset. Whether it is for evacuation of people from Wuhan or elsewhere, Air India has been at the heart of it,” the civil aviation minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/int-l-flights-to-depend-on-demand-puri/story-JEQ6xyNgqh3JkZGPRw17NO.html
21-06-2020||India||‘Surge in Covid-19 cases in Himachal but not at the pace as in other states’: CM||Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jairam Thakur is facing the twin challenges of battling the Covid-19 pandemic and bickering within the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In an interview with Chetan Chauhan, Thakur spoke about how the state has kept the Covid-19 numbers low and his plans to revive the economy. He also said an alleged fraud in the purchase of medical equipment, which prompted Himachal BJP president Rajeev Bindal to resign in May, had been dealt with sternly. Edited excerpts: How has Himachal dealt with Covid-19?A: In Himachal, corona has increased but not at the pace as in other states. In Himachal, we continued with curfew to explain to people in simple terms that they don’t have to go out. Lockdown, for some people, meant that they can go out. Strict implementation helped as it did not allow spread of Covid till Tablighi Jamaat attendees returned from {a religious congregation in} New Delhi in April first week. Despite that, management within the state was so good that we didn’t allow the cases to increase. We decided to chase the virus and not allowed the virus to chase us. We formed a team of 16,000 personnel, who went to all 70 lakh homes, and took health details of all. We now have a health profile off every home in the state.So why has the number of cases increased to about 615? A. When Himachalis from other states start returning in May, cases increased. On May 1, we had one Covid positive case. When the PM held a video conference with all CMs, he told all of us to ensure that migrants are able to return home safely. We brought back people from across India and students from Kota{coaching schools} also came back. Now there are 615 cases. We have a mechanism to ensure every returnee is kept in institutional quarantine and is tested. The village committees are vigilant and report if someone fails to report his or her return.  Watch | Covid & bickering within BJP: Himachal CM Jairam Thakur faces twin battlePM has spoken about unlock norms. In Himachal, tourism and horticulture are two important cogs of the state’s economy. How do you plan to revive them?A. Tourism in Himachal and the entire world is badly affected. Nowhere are people eager to travel and I don’t see a quick tourism revival. Although we are getting calls that people want to come to Himachal, we have not given a relaxation in unlock norms, as Covid cases are still high outside Himachal. We decided to wait. In coming times, we would be developing Himachal Pradesh as a safe wellness destination for tourists. I foresee, a lot of changes in the tourism sector as Covid is not going to disappear one fine day. Our people have suffered as 55,000 people are directly employed and lakhs are indirectly employed {in tourism}. Home stay is a big income source, which is gone. The situation is worrisome.What are your plans for horticulture?A. Horticulture sector has been affected. Cherry season went well; we planned marketing and farmers did not lose much. Apple season, which is ₹4,000 to 4,500 crore economy, has three important components --- packaging material, marketing and labour. We have started factories and are arranging for 2.5 crore apple packaging boxes. For selling, there can be an issue if Azadpur market (in New Delhi) closes because of Covid. We have raised the issue with the PM and are working on the alternatives. Third is labour, most of which comes from Nepal. Nepalese workers go back to their homes in November-December, and return to Himachal in April-May. This year, many have not come back because of the lockdown. Now, we have border issues with Nepal, and China (the military standoff at the Line of Actual Control) has also happened. I have written to the external affairs and home ministry to allow Nepalese labour to come {back}. As an alternative, we are getting workers from Haryana, UP and Bihar. On the positive side, we are expecting a good market for apples, as there would be less imports of apples from China and the US this year.Former BJP state president Rajeev Bindal had to resign because of the alleged scam in purchase of personal protection equipment kits, which is said to be a result of internal bickering.A. It is not a big scam. We are trying to save every person and people have suffered because of Covid. In this, if someone tries to steal, there cannot be a bigger sin than that. Party president (Bindal) is not directly involved in the scam (of purchase of PPE kits). The issue was that the director of health, who seemed to be seeking money (for award of PPE kit contracts) is considered close to him. When the opposition raised the issue, he (Bindal) resigned on moral grounds. The day the audio (of a conversation between the health director and a company functionary) went viral, we arrested the director and his accomplice has also been arrested. Although they are on bail now, we have taken immediate action and suspended the director, health. I have been in the Vidhan Sabha for 25 years and we have been raising several such issues when Congress was in power but no one was arrested, no action was taken and there was only a promise of an inquiry. We have conducted and inquiry and have taken the best possible action. I don’t want to go into corruption of crore of rupees during the Congress rule.There are three vacant positions in your Cabinet. When do you plan to fill them?A. That keeps on happening in several states. Three positions are vacant and the government is running well. We have asked the party high command to tell us the appropriate time to fill these posts. When we get the permission, we will fill them. It is not a big issue.How does Himachal plan to implement the Unlock phase?A. Finances of many states are in a bad shape. Himachal finances depend totally on the Centre’s assistance. In Unlock Phase 1, we have {offered some} relaxations and started public transport, whose occupancy is increasing. Markets have opened, but only 30% of the business is happening. Industries have resumed operations at about 60%. Pharma sector is running at 70-80% and companies are providing hydorocholoroquine and other medicines for Covid warriors across India and abroad. To revive the state’s economy, we have reduced expenditure especially by cutting down on food subsidy to income tax payees for a year. We will use Rs 12,000 crore unspent funds of departments for carrying out development activities such as building roads, ensuring water supply and other works. We have not cut salaries of employees and I expect revenue to improve in the coming months.EOM||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surge-in-cases-in-himachal-but-not-at-the-pace-as-in-other-states-cm/story-X1lIQi4PE7saaw3wQPltMJ.html
21-06-2020||India||PM launches Rs 50,000-crore jobs scheme to help migrants||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched a Rs. 50,000 crore rural jobs programme, the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan aimed at creating livelihoods for thousands of jobless migrant workers who moved back from the cities to their home villages during the lockdown imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) The make-work scheme, which will utilise existing rural infrastructure programmes, will offer 125 days of employment in 116 districts across six states that have witnessed large-scale reverse migration of workers from the cities, triggering a livelihood crisis. India’s jobless rate rose to over 20% during the lockdown in which period, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring of the Indian Economy. The new scheme will fund 25 categories of public infrastructure facilities, such as laying fibre optic cable for rural internet, railway work, sanitation, waste management, poultry and farm ponds: Krishi Vigyan Kendras will train the workers in horticulture.Twelve ministries or departments—rural development, panchayati raj, transport, mines, drinking water, environment, railways, petroleum, new and renewable energy, border roads, telecom and agriculture—will participate in the programme.“Today is historic day as a massive campaign has kick-started for the welfare of the poor, for their employment,” the prime minister said, launching the scheme via video conference. “It is our endeavour that through this campaign, workers are given work near their homes.”The programme, which was launched from Telihar village of Bihar’s Khagaria district, will cover 116 districts across Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said on Thursday that the scheme will not involve new budgetary allocation. The 25 schemes will be “front-loaded” or funded from current budgetary allocations, she had said. Although there is no official data on the reverse migration sparked by the pandemic shutdowns, the finance minister had on May 14 allocated Rs 3,500 crore for food aid to an estimated 80 million migrant workers. This is the only official estimate available for the number of workers affected by the pandemic. According to chief minister Nitish Kumar, nearly three million migrant workers have returned to Bihar alone since the Covid-19 pandemic prompted the Centre to order a lockdown with effect from March 25. During the launch, the prime minister interacted with several people who came back home to Bihar from places including Delhi, Gurugram (Haryana) and Rajasthan. Union minister of rural development Narendra Singh Tomar, Bihar chief minister Kumar and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath were among those who were present.“It is of great necessity that high speed and cheap internet be provided in every rural household to help the youth and children,” Modi said. “That is why this is the first time that the rural areas are using more internet than the urban areas. Hence the laying of fibre optic cable and provision of internet are also made a part of the Abhiyan.”“Migrants will be provided jobs near their homes. So far, you were using your talent for the progress of the cities. Now you will help in the development of your villages, your neighbourhoods,” PM Modi said.Sitharaman had said that in 125 days, nearly 25 schemes will be brought together to reach saturation and will include the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna, Jal Jeevan Yojna and PM Gram Sadak Yojna, among others.Analysts say while an expansion of rural make-work projects is necessary to deal with the crisis, there are challenges in creating avenues for productive work. “I don’t think funding for such projects will be a challenge and they will be accounted for when revised estimates are presented. However, finding useful projects that are productive enough and add value to the larger rural economy may be a challenge,” said Siraj Hussain, former Union agriculture secretary and a current visiting senior fellow with the think-tank ICRIER||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-launches-50k-cr-jobs-scheme-to-help-migrants/story-ZUAkf8v9MLjVHVj2PRtnUI.html
21-06-2020||India||India’s Covid-19 count crosses 4 lakh, deaths reach 13,000-mark||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in India exceeded 400,000 on Saturday, including at least 13,000 deaths, with the country reporting a record number of daily new cases and becoming only the fourth nation after the US, Brazil and Russia to cross the grim milestone.On Saturday, 15,813 people were diagnosed with Covid-19, in the country’s highest single-day spike that took the total tally to 411,500 cases. The pandemic appears to be accelerating in India at a time when most lockdown restrictions have been lifted to mitigate the economic impact of the restrictions that brought to a standstill most economic activity in the country. The latest 100,000 infections in the country have been recorded in just eight days – lower than the 10 days it took for the previous 100,000 infections and 15 days for the 100,000 cases before that mark.It took the country 78 days to cross the first 100,000 cases, a development experts attribute to the early imposition of the lockdown in India, when the country had just over 600 confirmed Covid-19 cases.About 75% of the total infections in India have been reported between May 19 and June 20, according to data collated by HT. Additionally, the positivity rate, or the average rate of samples testing positive for Covid-19 across the country, rose from 4.6% for the week ending May 17 to 7.8% for the week ending June 17.In absolute terms, 6.2% of the over 6.6 million samples have tested positive for the disease, according to latest data by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Out of these, 189,869 tests were conducted in the previous 24-hour period, ICMR said on Saturday morning.The increase in the testing capacity, coupled with the rise in the number of patients being diagnosed for Covid-19, is an indication of the virus’ prevalence in India, experts say. “It is only natural that if you test more, more people will test positive... India is currently at the ascending limb of the epidemic. We have not reached the peak [of infections] yet, and in this situation, this is what will happen [more people will test positive],” said Dr Lalit Kant, the former head of epidemiology and communicable disease at ICMR. The spread of the disease, which originated in China late last year, crippled economies world over as countries put in place strict lockdowns and enforced social distancing norms to slow the infection’s rampage. The pathogen, named Sars-CoV-2 for its similarity to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome disease, has infected over 8.8 million people and claimed 464,294 lives globally.While most European countries are easing restrictions to return to a new normal, one that includes face masks and one-metre distancing in public areas, there are little signs of the virus abating in the new hot spots, signalling its ability to find a foothold in lesser-affected areas.Experts say the pandemic is now in its third surge of the outbreak – the first being in China, second in Europe and the US, and the latest thriving in Latin American countries such as Brazil, Peru and Chile along with India, Mexico and Russia.In India, the three worst-hit states Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu account for nearly 60% of the total infections, with the contagion largely establishing a strong foothold in urban hot spots such as Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai.According to figures by state health departments, Maharashtra saw 128,205 Covid-19 patients in the state and 5,984 deaths till Saturday. At 56,845 cases, Tamil Nadu — the second worst-hit state in the country — has less than half of Maharashtra’s tally, and 704 mortalities. New Delhi reported 56,746 positive patients and 2,112 fatalities linked to the disease. On Saturday, the total fatalities across the country stood at 13,278, reflecting a case fatality rate – defined as the proportion of deaths to the total infected patients – of 3.2%, much lower than the global rate of around 5.2%. Data also showed that 228,145 patients or 55.4% of those infected so far have recovered from the respiratory illness in India.According to public health experts, controlling the number of deaths due to the disease – that particularly affects the elderly and those with existing medical ailments — is key to controlling the outbreak and will determine if the health infrastructure in the country will withstand the disease burden or buckle under it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-count-crosses-4l-deaths-reach-13k-mark/story-dSsjdbguN6J5CTvXQjmA6N.html
21-06-2020||Today's||The China factor in Indian politics||The brutal killing of 20 personnel of the Indian Army, including a colonel-level officer, by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the Galwan Valley on the night of June 15 will reverberate across India for a long time to come. Indian security personnel — from the armed forces, paramilitary forces, and the police — have often given their lives in the quest to defend India’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and the Constitution. And as often, their contribution is forgotten. But Colonel Santosh Babu and the 19 other men killed in the line of duty will stay on in public memory for three reasons. First, this was the first time since 1975 that Indian blood was shed defending the border against China. Two, the nature of the killing was brutal — PLA, in what India has called a “pre-meditated” attack, violated norms of war. And India and China are not even officially at war. And finally, their killing has highlighted the place of Ladakh in general, and Galwan Valley in particular, as essential to India’s territorial imagination. This, then, can make June 15 — or Ladakh 2020 — the moment when, for two generations of Indians, the security threat from China has become tangible and real. It can make it the moment when discussions about the “competitive-cooperative” relationship with China and how to navigate great power politics will move beyond the rarefied seminar circuits of elite analysts and assume a strong place in public consciousness. And it can make it the moment when China becomes an issue in Indian domestic politics, strongly tied to public opinion, partisan positions, and the idea of nationalism. The intersection of domestic politics and foreign policy is old. Indeed, a lot of scholarship suggests that foreign policy itself is the extension of domestic politics and is shaped substantially by it. In India’s case too, this has been true. But barring the 1962 war, and the criticism that the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru faced, the most critical foreign policy issue has been Pakistan. This is not surprising. The tragedy of Partition, Pakistan’s support for Khalistan, the Kashmir question, its sponsorship of terrorism in India which has cost thousands of lives, four wars (1948, 1965, 1971 and 1999), and the manner in which the external enemy (Pakistan) is often used in political discourse to demonise an internal constituency (Indian Muslims) lends the India-Pakistan relationship particular political salience. Indeed, as the saying in South Block goes, the real joint secretary in charge of the Pakistan desk at the ministry of external affairs is the Prime Minister of India. And that is because each decision on Pakistan is a political, not a bureaucratic, one. The Indian strategic community has long recognised China as a threat. The border dispute and Beijing’s efforts to change the facts on the ground by its consistent incursions; its claim over Arunachal Pradesh, particularly Tawang; the large trade deficit; China’s firm support to its “all-weather friend”, Pakistan, now buttressed by the China-Pakistan economic corridor; its efforts to box in India by encouraging regimes hostile to New Delhi in the neighbourhood; its moves to thwart India’s legitimate ambitions (such as permanent membership of the Security Council or entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group); and its ambitions to establish new style imperialism through the Belt and Road Initiative have all been closely noted and are a part of the institutional memory of the government of India. But along with this, there is also a recognition of the power asymmetry between the two countries. India’s economy is much weaker; its military and technological capabilities don’t match up to China; its State capacity is more limited; and in the maze that is international politics, China is a more significant player and India cannot rely on partnerships and external bandwagoning. Along with it, India — at this stage of its economic development — needs foreign capital and investment, and deepening economic interdependence with China has been seen as a way to both neutralise the competitive elements and aid Indian development. This measured policy approach worked because China was not an issue that animated public opinion. But it will now face a challenge. This is both because of China’s aggression (not unique to India — just ask Vietnam, Japan, Australia and others in its neighbourhood) and because in Indian democracy, policies cannot be completely out of sync with popular sentiment. The killings of June 15 have suddenly woken a large number of citizens to the fact that Pakistan is an important, but perhaps not the most important, security challenge India confronts. The Chinese willingness to assert itself abroad under President Xi Jinping, and the power differential with India, makes it a more serious adversary. The calls for boycotting Chinese goods may be populist and rooted in ignorance of economic realities but they reflect the emerging mood about China, which is going beyond suspicion to a degree of loathing. The evolution of public opinion is bound to have an impact on political discourse. And that is why even a prime minister such as Narendra Modi — who has proudly worn the badge of nationalism and presented himself as a security hawk — had to face tough questions, not just from critics but also more independent observers, about his claim on Friday night that there is no external presence in Indian territory. The Prime Minister’s Office, on Saturday, came up with a clarification. But the response to his initial statement is instructive. Indian public opinion is not in the mood to tolerate even the hint of a territorial concession to China anymore. This, then, will have an impact on the politics of nationalism in India. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — by disengaging with Pakistan till it acts on terror and through the surgical and air strikes under its term in office — has projected itself as a staunchly nationalist force. But now, it will have to be accountable for its actions on China too. The well-meaning advice to the Opposition not to “politicise” the national security issue may go unheeded, for if the ruling dispensation has benefited from weaponising national security for electoral ends, the Opposition will seek to emulate the same. Expect the BJP to talk about Pakistan, and expect the Opposition to counter it with China from now on. Ladakh 2020 has introduced the China factor into Indian politics. Its consequences will be long-lasting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-china-factor-in-indian-politics/story-VEbt7c3DPlLxbX2Ua60v8M.html
