30-06-2020||News||It can no longer be business-as-usual | Analysis||The difference between the summer of 2020 and earlier face-offs between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh is that, this time around, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has come in strength.Several divisions of PLA have been deployed in the depth areas, and, consequently, there are also larger numbers of troops in close proximity to each other in the India–China border areas. The Indian Army has also made a matching build-up in the area and all along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Due to the sheer numbers as well as the fact that armour and artillery have also been brought up, it is apparent that PLA has planned and prepared this current offensive. It aims at moving the ground positions of Chinese troops right up to what they conceive is LAC.By doing so, what, in effect, the Chinese are attempting to accomplish is to unilaterally define and determine LAC without bilateral consultation with India. China will decide what is its territory and will move to exercise actual control over it. The Indian Army has blocked the Chinese and is deployed to protect Indian territorial integrity. What PLA has also managed to do is to violate all the principles, norms, standard procedures which have evolved over the past 25 years to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas. They have displayed how little store it sets by agreements signed by its own government.Strategically, what the Chinese are signalling to India and the world is that they are the number one power in Asia and that they will throw their weight around as they wish, whether in the South China Sea or on the India-China border. They also want India to understand and accept that China’s comprehensive national power far outweighs India’s, and that the nation must acknowledge its place in the pecking order of Asia. India must roll over and play dead. The 21st Century is not an Asian century but a Chinese century.India’s military action in eastern Ladakh, in turn, sends China the very clear message that India does not accept Chinese hegemony and will not tolerate its bullying and pushing. India shall stand up to it. The nation’s brave soldiers did exactly this, on that fateful night of June 15 in the Galwan Valley. Remember, the rest of the world is also watching. If China has thrown down the gauntlet, India has picked it up.Having militarily sent out the clear intention to take on China and oppose its aggressive methods aimed at browbeating other nations including India, we cannot let the rest of the India-China relationship continue as normal. It cannot be business as usual.Why? If India was to do that we would be negating the message of our military action on the ground, and, in stark contrast, be conveying to the Chinese that India can live with what its army has done. Therefore, India needs to reinforce and reiterate its military messaging through policy decisions which further underline India’s very clear national consensus not to accept Chinese big brotherly attitudes and plain bullying. It is for this reason that India will have to take measures to indicate that if there is no peace on the border, the rest of the relationship with China will also be negatively impacted. A reassessment and recalibration of India’s China policy are required to make India’s messaging crystal clear.The first step in this resetting of India’s China policy was the ban on 59 Chinese apps such as TikTok, WeChat and UC Browser. India is only getting started. Banning Chinese firms on national security grounds from participating in India’s 5G trials and rollout will be a strong indication of New Delhi’s mindset.One consequence of Chinese actions will be for India to strengthen its partnerships with democracies such as the United States, Japan, France, South Korea and, perhaps, Indonesia. India must also expand its relations with Taiwan. Delhi will have to reassess its China policy with a cool, calm, rational frame of mind. There is no need for knee-jerk reactions. In order to weigh the options which can be on the table, India has to have widespread consultations which must be timebound. The new policy must be implemented within 2020 itself.Such a reset and recalibration of India’s China policy, particularly in the economic realm, cannot be accomplished without causing some pain to ourselves. When we have decided that a strong message needs to be sent to China, then we must also be ready to bear the pain.Indian soldiers have done this on our borders; now it is time for ordinary Indians to show that they are willing to do so too. The pain is likely to come in the form of higher consumer prices for certain products; it may come in the form of lower profits for firms; it may also take the form of lower revenues for traders. We shall have to accept some pain, if we are to convey that we are a strong, united nation which China has made the mistake of riling. India’s strength of character will have to be put on full display to indicate to China that it will not be business as usual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/it-can-no-longer-be-business-as-usual-analysis/story-UaU4oP00LWxEyGWx9EHT9J.html
30-06-2020||News||After the ban, what next for India’s digital ecosystem | Analysis||The ministry of electronics and information technology (MeiTY) banned 59 Chinese digital applications available in India on Monday evening. The list of banned applications includes TikTok, a popular user-generated content platform, and UC Browser, the most widely used Internet browser in second and third-tier cities. The government ban, affected under the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, seems to form a part of the retaliatory strategy against Chinese incursions in Ladakh. This is the first time that India has used such a direct lever in the digital sphere, to react to military events.Several commentators have warned that the Internet might splinter along national borders in the future, as countries such as India increasingly assert their sovereignty in cyberspace. This reality seems closer than ever, since the world is simultaneously witnessing the Covid-19 pandemic, a widespread economic slowdown and the destabilising impact of the trade war between the United States (US) and China. Uncertainty breeds fear-based responses like protectionism. This is evident in the responses of the US and the United Kingdom, which have signalled a retreat from globalisation, a framework they have championed for decades. The digital economy is not immune to such fundamental shifts. It is worth asking whether India is prepared for a Balkanised digital world. According to Ericsson, global mobile data traffic was around 456 exabytes in 2019, of which India accounted for approximately 75 exabytes, or 16%. Around 14% of the global population resides in India, and therefore, it punches slightly above its weight in terms of mobile data consumption. However, India has not begun to generate commensurate economic value from this outsized data consumption yet. In fact, the global digital economy seems to mimic its physical counterpart, with the US and China making up the lion’s share.According to the United Nations, the US and China account for 90% of the market capitalisation of the 70 largest digital platforms in the world. They also account for 75% of all patents related to blockchain technologies, 50% of global spending on the Internet of Things, and more than 75% of the global market for public cloud computing. It’s clear that the two countries will remain at the forefront of global technological developments, which will feed their dominance in the digital economy. The emergence of this bipolar digital landscape narrows India’s strategic choices. The world’s largest digital democracy must foster innovation, competition and scale in the private sector, as well as increase State capacity to govern new markets in parallel.The biggest digital companies in the world are platforms that offer multiple functions. Such platforms now determine how a large share of the global population communicates, transacts, searches for information and services, buys consumer products, finds new jobs, stores data, distributes and markets products, and so on. Many of the companies that India banned on Monday also follow the platform model. They achieved multi-functionality and a global scale because, like the US, China allows its digital entrepreneurs to take risks. The People’s Republic of China picks winners and provides unconditional State support for its national champions to scale. On the other hand, the US provides legal certainty for innovation and competition to flourish. India will have to strike a balance between both these approaches.In either case, sudden bans cannot be part of India’s playbook. The digital ecosystem is a breeding ground for the creative destruction of old methods of doing business. It must also prompt a revisit of old approaches to economic regulation, including blunt instruments reminiscent of the licence-permit raj.India’s digital applications are governed by a 20-year-old law and an eight-year-old policy. Both are unsuitable to digital markets because they were designed for the business process outsourcing ecosystem, not for modern digital applications or platforms. Similarly, the Copyright Act, which provides incentives and protections for most of the content, organised datasets and source codes, that sit at the heart of the digital economy, was last amended in 2012. India’s top 10 digital companies are valued at a tenth of the Chinese equivalents, while its per capita income is about 44% of China’s. There is, therefore, room for India to unlock greater value through a digital reboot of rules and regulations.Finally, just as India is revisiting its alignments in international relations, it may have to develop a cogent strategy for trade and commerce in the digital economy. If the revenues of information technology-enabled services are anything to go by, a majority of digital economy revenues will come from exports. A large share of these exports will head westwards. This trend will hold because the economic impact of the pandemic is likely to be more pronounced in developing countries than in developed ones. The country will need exports to offset the concomitant slowdown in domestic consumption. Since global trade is built on the principle of reciprocity, India must do to others, as it wishes for itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/after-the-ban-what-next-for-india-s-digital-ecosystem/story-beF2f9jhqAWYYHRlk49G9J.html
30-06-2020||News||Covid-19: Changing what it means to travel safely | Analysis||Our ability to move has shaped the world, and it will dictate the future of the human race. But as the world struggles through an unprecedented lockdown, it faces a scary, new question: How will cities safely move billions of people after a pandemic?Before Covid-19, we took mobility for granted. On an average day, five million travelled by the Delhi Metro, and over 10 million by Delhi’s public buses. The Indian Railways carried over 24 million, and Mumbai’s buses over 30 million passengers a day. A million passengers travelled through India’s airports every day.Today, those numbers are down sharply. As India thinks about how to reopen safely, the question will be how will it move millions, while keeping people safe. Can you have social distancing during rush hour on a Mumbai local train? In 2020, will we be torn between environment-friendly, efficient mass transit and fuel-guzzling personal transport?It’s heartening to see that India’s pioneering technology services industry has embraced working from home. However, for many, personal transport or working from home is not an option. Mass transit must find solutions to get back up and running while slowing the spread of the coronavirus. The New York City Transit, responsible for the city’s buses and subway, is testing social distancing markers at stations, as well as “rides by reservation”. The city’s subway authorities disinfect each train every night. The Paris, London and Singapore Transit authorities are making face masks mandatory for riders, installing thermal scanners, and limiting the number of seats available on trains. In China, robots are disinfecting trains and stations, and providing hand sanitisers to passengers. Smart-card readers with thermal scanners can even spot feverish passengers.My prediction is that many governments and transit companies will rely more on apps and contactless travel — a trend that was already taking hold, and will be catalysed by the crisis.Airlines and long-distance travel options also aim to contain the spread by measures such as blocking the middle seats, thermal scanning for passengers, sanitisation upgrades, inter-seat separators, and readjusting the air-conditioning systems every three-to-four minutes.These solutions are useful, but there is an opportunity for more. After spending my entire career in transportation, and now as CEO of Virgin Hyperloop, I believe it is critical that we collectively and proactively invest in infrastructure that will serve us in the next century. Let’s encourage investment that not only helps us rebuild, but evolve. This crisis is upon us and we need to provide a solution that moves the masses in a safe way, and helps to bolster the economy for the people of the region.One of the first things we need to grapple with is figuring out how transportation should deal with future pandemics, in addition to running efficiently in normal circumstances.As it turns out, the hyperloop’s basic design and technology make it ideally suited for social distancing, should the need arise. That’s because it delivers passengers with a fleet of pods, with an average of 28 seats per pod, that are guided by a command-and-control system that balances supply and demand. In “distancing operation” mode, where social distancing mandates the passenger density to be, say, reduced to half, the number of pods in the system can increase to move more people through the system safely. This can all happen while not stopping the system. Unlike rail, the pods are controlled by an artificial-intelligence-powered automation system, allowing them to travel within seconds of each other (like cars on a highway), safely.The system is demand-responsive. The hyperloop can anticipate and control ridership in emergencies or special situations. You don’t have to “trust” passengers to be physically distant, as in subways, for example; you can enforce a certain number of empty seats on each pod or give priority to emergency and health care workers.Even in “normal” operations, we still want to take precautions and provide a seamless customer experience. The hyperloop is designed to have touchless ticketing with minimum human exposure, advanced filtration, and regular cleaning. The system also enables a flexible station design, allowing decentralisation and less crowding at the stations since multiple smaller pods leave within minutes vs a larger train with multiple cars.Safety is at the forefront of our minds right now, but it is critical that we think about the big picture. We must still look to fight congestion and the climate crisis. Take the Mumbai-Pune corridor, where we hope to invest in and build the world’s first commercial hyperloop system, which will shrink a 3.5 hour trip to less than 30 minutes, with zero direct emissions. It has the capacity to move over 200 million passengers annually to meet the demand of this route. We feel that this private investment into Maharashtra will help support the people with new opportunities for growth. We hope that we can work together to make it happen in the near future. We are ready.I still believe our ability to move will dictate the future of the human race. Our ability to move billions safely in a pandemic will help decide its present, and its near future. The tail of this pandemic is going to be a long one, and mass transit and transportation around the world has to adapt, so that passengers are safe and can continue with their lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-changing-what-it-means-to-travel-safely/story-NrbOCac2LbTjyY33wStyNN.html
30-06-2020||News||Black Lives Matter: Protest movements of marginalised groups highlight the gap in the principles and actual practice of democracy||The video of the killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis on May 25 triggered a wave of protests against police brutality and systematic racism in the United States. For over four weeks now, setting aside concerns for their personal safety, in the midst of a global pandemic, hundreds of thousands have marched to support the Black Lives Matter Movement (BLM). Protest of disadvantaged groups are infrequent and rarely matter. The BLM protests are different. Why? Their geographical spread, diversity, and their ability to remain peaceful enable a shift in American public opinion, and, therefore, make these protests politically consequential. The BLM protests have spread to 2,000 cities across all 50 states in America. Such a broad geographical footprint of the protest points to its resonance across a large part of the country. Scholars have suggested that historically American geography has stood in the way of protest politics of disadvantaged groups. Since prominent cities are far apart in this continental country, protest movements through the 19th and the 2th century could not spread across cities in real time, constraining their ability to push for policy change. In explaining the relative ineffectiveness of labour agitations in America as compared to western Europe, Alberto Alesina and Edward Glaeser, for example, note, “America’s great distances have made it difficult for strikers in industrial areas to impact Washington, DC.” Moreover, police departments fall under the jurisdiction of city governments, localising the politics of anti-police grievance. But, today, the conversation on racial justice and police violence against blacks is a countrywide phenomenon in the US.Protests of marginalised minority groups need allies to become politically consequential. If these were black-only protests, it would be easy for the Republican and Democratic parties as well as elected leaders to ignore them. African Americans are only 12% of the electorate and 90% of their vote supports the Democratic Party, which can sometimes take their vote for granted. The Republicans ignore, or are openly hostile to the concerns of the community. They have often used the manufactured threat of a violent and entitled black minority to consolidate the majority white vote. This traditional calculus stands disturbed, since the protests have grabbed the sympathy of a section of the white community. The 2020 protests against racial injustice have brought together a rainbow coalition of races and ethnicities. Influential actors, including major corporations, sports leagues, and even the US military, who have pointedly remained silent during previous protests, have spoken strongly in favor of BLM movement. By contrast, in the 1960s the black protesters not entirely, but mostly marched alone. Another striking aspect of BLM protests is the high rates of participation of women across racial backgrounds. Television and social media coverage show substantial presence of women at BLM marches. A racially diverse makeup and higher participation of women amplifies the appeal of the protests. Bluntly put, when white male cops beat, taser, pepper spray, tear gas white women on live television or in viral videos, white middle-class America is not impressed. Whether it is social change or reelection of Donald Trump in November, white middle-class America’s support is crucial to these outcomes.The sporadic violence and looting that accompanied the first wave of BLM protests has gradually disappeared. Research tells us that peaceful protests draw more supporters, are more likely to attract the sympathy of bystanders, and when met with a harsh response from the State, can rob the security forces of public support. Non-violent protests, then, are far more likely to shift public opinion. By remaining largely peaceful, BLM marches have harnessed the benefits of this tactic. The infamous images of the forceful clearing of peaceful protestors from Lafayette Square in Washington DC by security forces further bolstered the moral legitimacy of BLM movement and drew more people to the protests. By contrast, the National Guard and police units implicated in the operation suffered a loss of credibility. Police brutality is a political issue in America because BLM movement has made it into one. A recently released Monmouth University poll found that 57% of Americans believe that the police are more likely to use excessive force against African Americans as compared to whites. In 2016, only 34% respondents felt similarly. The shift among the white respondents, from 25% in 2016 to 49% in 2020, is equally striking. Writing in the New York Times, Nate Cohn and Kevin Queali confirm this trend: “Polls show that a majority of Americans believe that the police are more likely to use deadly force against African-Americans, and that there’s a lot of discrimination against black Americans in society. Back in 2013, when Black Lives Matter began, a majority of voters disagreed with all of these statements.” The shift in attitudes is also driving the cleansing of the American public sphere of symbols of racial stereotypes and injustice. Prestigious universities, historical statues, flags, popular food brands, music bands, even iconic films find themselves in the uncomfortable public gaze. Having survived past protests, today, they are disappearing or changing.Protest movements of marginalised groups are a moment of clarification for an undemocratic society living in a democratic political system. They highlight the gap in the principles and actual practice of democracy. Thanks to social media, today, protests can appear and spread swiftly, but previous experience suggests that durable social change occurs at glacial speed. Protests of the marginalised also produce backlash from privileged groups. In 2020, American politics remains deeply polarised between Republicans and Democrats. The African American community is forced to electorally ally with one side in this conflict, an attribute that adds to their vulnerability. Just because blacks vote, does not necessarily mean that they have a voice in democratic politics. Their protest movements amplify their voice. Through protests, the black community holds its representatives, the democratic process, and society accountable. Slowly, then, these protest movements also nudge society towards social change.Amit Ahuja teaches political science at University of California-Santa Barbara, and is the author of Mobilizing the Marginalized: Ethnic Parties Without Ethnic MovementsThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/black-lives-matter-protest-movements-of-marginalised-groups-highlight-the-gap-in-the-principles-and-actual-practice-of-democracy/story-6bvU9vzWYoHY4NDzJBL3EL.html
30-06-2020||News||UAPA: When laws turn oppressive | Opinion||Many of India’s laws have become instruments of oppression rather than vehicles to regulate conduct. One such law is the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (UAPA). It is primarily meant to combat terror and proscribe known terrorist organisations. Parliament, in the latest amendment to UAPA in July 2019, chose to proscribe individuals and their activities by paving the way to name individuals as terrorists even though they may have no affiliation with any of the 36 terrorist organisations referred to in the First Schedule of the Act. The government seeks to justify this amendment consistent with its alleged desire to effectively deal with terrorists and terrorist organisations who threaten security. Unfortunately, the provisions of UAPA have, in the recent past, been used against those known to speak up for the oppressed, those who foster the cause of civil rights, and others who oppose the government and its policies.The home minister, when moving the amendment, justified naming an individual as a terrorist if he or she “is a terrorist worker or takes part in any terrorist act”. He also said that those who “help to promote or prepare for terrorism should also be designated as a terrorist(s)” including individuals “who raise(s) money to promote terrorism”. It is true that a person who, as a member of a terrorist organisation, carries forward its agenda by participating in a terrorist act, must be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of UAPA. However, we move into a somewhat grey zone when the State seeks to prosecute people by charging them with “preparing” for terrorism or “promoting” terrorism or raising money to “promote” terrorism. Unless a direct nexus is established between the acts of preparation or promotion of the terrorist act itself and the activity of a terrorist organisation, the Act will be used, and has been used, to silence those who oppose the State for its discriminatory policies and actions. The home minister further said that there are others who attempt to plant “terrorist literature” and infiltrate young minds with “terrorist theory”. What kind of literature is “terrorist literature”, what “theories” influence young minds, and what kind of “propaganda” is perceived to be a “terrorist act” are concepts ill-defined and easily misused. So far, no individual has been named as a “terrorist” under UAPA. But many highly-regarded leaders of society, journalists, students who have opposed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA, and who were perceived by the State to hold views contrary to that of the government, are currently being investigated with intent to prosecute under UAPA.The data available with the National Crime Records Bureau Report 2018 suggests that the conviction rate of those prosecuted under UAPA was as low as 14.5% in 2015 and as high as 49.3% in 2017. The total number of persons arrested in 2018 was 1,421; other relevant data includes those charge-sheeted (853), convicted (35), discharged (23) and acquitted (117). Clearly, the rate of conviction in 2018 was less than 30%. Of those convicted by the trial court, several may well be acquitted by the appellate court, making the rate of conviction abysmally low. This is proof of the investigating authorities roping in named accused who are clearly not terrorists, making the law and procedures under it oppressive. Many of them are kept in custody for years before acquittal. An indication of the law’s indiscriminate misuse is reflected in the kind of people arrested under UAPA. Some disturbing examples among others are: Akhil Gogoi, a Right to Information Act activist; Safoora Zargar, a research scholar from Jamia Millia Islamia; Anand Teltumbde and Gautam Navlakha, both of whom have done seminal work in protecting India’s most vulnerable communities, namely the Dalits and Adivasis; Masrat Zahra, a 26-year-old internationally-acclaimed photojournalist; Umar Khalid for allegedly instigating the Delhi riots with his speeches at anti-CAA rallies; and Gowhar Geelani, a Kashmiri author and journalist, for his social media posts.The reason why naming individuals is oppressive and violates citizens’ fundamental freedoms is because of the onerous provisions relating to bail. First, those being investigated can be kept in custody for 180 days pending filing of the charge-sheet. Bail is refused if the court, on perusal of the case diary or upon filing of a charge-sheet, is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusations against the person are prima facie true. It is the settled position in law that the accused cannot have access to the case diary. As far as the charge-sheet is concerned, the act of taking cognisance by the court is based on a prima facie belief that the accusations are true. At that stage, the accused is not heard by the court. This makes the law onerous and offensive, with no hope for the accused to access bail. Trials, too, take long. At the end of 2018, of the 2,008 cases, only 317 were sent to trial. Given the state of the law, an acquittal at the end of the trial means little.The imbalance between fundamental freedoms and the larger interests of the State is heavily skewed against the citizen. The State uses the law as an instrument of oppression, making democracy its victim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/uapa-when-laws-turn-oppressive/story-d9d7OEO50LQjLZs3Ba5pzI.html
30-06-2020||News||At LAC, continue to ramp up infrastructure||Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi recently stated that 20 jawans were martyred but not before they taught a lesson to those who had dared to raise an eye towards “Bharat Mata”. PM assured the nation that, today, it has the capability that no one could eye even an inch of its territory. He suggested that the infrastructure in the border areas had improved greatly, leading to heightened patrolling and close monitoring of movements at the border. PM also made it clear that India would respond firmly to any attempts to transgress the Line of Actual Control (LAC).China has always made a creeping annexation part of its policy towards India. The Congress, when in power, turned a blind eye to the encroachment on India’s territories by the Chinese through continuous transgressions and border violations. Though the country entered into as many as six bilateral agreements in 1988, 1993, 1996, 2005, 2012 and 2013, it did not address the dispute over LAC. When the Chinese intruded and pitched tents deep inside India’s territory at Depsang, in 2013, the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh merely spoke in Parliament about the Chinese having a different perception about LAC. Confidence-Building Measures (CBMs) were misused by the Chinese to resort to psychological warfare and “salami slicing”. This is because, after 1962, defence forces were neglected and infrastructure was shoddy.After Modi assumed power, strengthening infrastructure became a national priority. Today, there has been a great leap in infrastructure development at the Indo-China border on the Indian side which has served as a deterrent to China. Had the infrastructural development started in past regimes, India would have been in a more dominant position today. After 2014, India created a strong road network through the Border Roads Organisation and the Central Public Works Department despite the small window, during the year, for construction, due to the harsh winter. The Border Area Development Programme (BADP) has been allocated ~784 crore in the fiscal year 2020-2021. BADP stipulates that “10% of the total allocated funds will be additionally allocated to the states/Union territories abutting Indo-China Border (Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh, Sikkim and Uttarakhand) for taking up works in the districts abutting Indo-China border”. The creation of infrastructure “would help integrate these area with the hinterland, create a positive perception of care by the country and encourage the people to stay or in the border areas leading to safe and secure border” as per the ministry of home affairs. Infrastructure has developed on all borders through the comprehensive Integrated Border Management Systems — be it border out posts, border fencing, mobile towers, the use of technology at the border and lighting. On the Indo-Tibet border, roads, helipads, tunnels and bridges have been built. At the same time, there has been an increase in patrolling — be it long-range patrols, short-range patrols or joint patrols by the Army and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police. India has held its ground in several face-offs. Regular patrols also enable us to assess China’s activities, identify features of tactical importance, dominate infiltration routes, corroborate inputs and assert our presence. Post-2014, our patrols have been actively engaging, confronting and preventing any incursions. We have not allowed any construction activity in our territory within LAC. In Doklam, India stalled the construction of a road by the Chinese, which would have adversely affected the nation’s strategic interests. It is only after this that China became more wary of India’s diplomatic and military might.Work on a link road, part of an infrastructure project of a strategic road in Ladakh, is one of the factors which seems to have pushed China into its misadventure on June 15. They were given a bloody nose by Indian soldiers. Another reason which could have irked China is the fact that India did not support the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which was not advisable from the country’s security point of view. BRI was to establish China’s dominance in global trade. This included the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which is not acceptable to India as it goes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Other factors which angered China could have been the friendly relations between India and the United States and the formation of the two Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh as well as the abrogation of Article 370. This reflects China’s vulnerability and the Galwan Valley aggression seems to be the desperate act of a frustrated country.PM Modi’s policy towards China has been a judicious mix of diplomatic, military and economic options. He and President Xi Jinping have had as many as 18 summit meetings over the past six years, including two informal meetings at Mamallapuram and Wuhan. Several meetings have been held at different levels. The 15th meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination, was held on June 24, where India stressed on respecting LAC and both sides agreed to expeditiously implement the understanding on disengagement and de-escalation. While diplomatic parleys should continue, it is imperative to continue the PM’s policy to strengthen both the nation’s infrastructural and military build-up to contain the Dragon if it challenges us again. No one can challenge a determined India. Though India is a peaceful nation, we will negotiate only from a position of strength. And this can happen when strong leadership under PM Modi is guiding India’s security policy based on national interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/at-lac-continue-to-ramp-up-infrastructure/story-MqasiUwyVCJDadht7cdixI.html
30-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai records cleanest air since monitoring began||Overnight rain and high-speed winds helped Mumbai on Tuesday record its lowest pollution levels since air-quality monitoring began in 2015. The air quality index (AQI) equalled the all-time record of the past five years, which was on September 4, 2019.The pollutant-measuring indicator for PM2.5 pollutant — breathable particulate matter which is 2.5 microns in size or smaller that can cause ailments — was 12, falling under the ‘good’ category, according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research. It was 13 (good) during the day and improved further by the evening. The AQI has been predicted at 10 for Wednesday.Mumbai’s air on Tuesday was cleaner than major international cities such as London (21), Tokyo (52), Sydney (25), Singapore (25), but New York’s AQI was better at 10. All 10 locations where AQI is monitored in the city recorded ‘good’ air quality, and AQI levels did not cross 30. Colaba had the cleanest air with an AQI of 2, followed by Mazagaon at 5, Bhandup and Chembur at 8, Borivli 10, BKC 15, Andheri 16, Malad 17, Worli 18, and the highest of 26 at Navi Mumbai.Researchers from SAFAR said a combination of factors had led to the drop in air quality. “The lockdown period due to the Covid-19 pandemic had already brought down PM concentration to its background levels (concentration without being influenced by human-induced emissions). It takes time for PM levels to rise again even after emissions resurface. Intense rain over Mumbai between Monday night and early Tuesday morning, high moisture content in the city’s air, combined with wind speed up to a maximum of 30kmph, allow swift dispersion of pollutants close to the surface,” said Gufran Beig, director, SAFAR. “This is a characteristic of the monsoon, but it is getting further enhanced due to restrictions in place over the past few months. AQI and PM concentration is likely to remain in the ‘good’ category as rainfall has been predicted in the coming days.” The concentration of PM2.5 was as low as 7 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3), against the prescribed limit of 60µg/m3 for 24 hours as national safe standard, and 25 µg/m3 as the World Health Organization (WHO) safe standard. PM2.5 levels are likely to fall further to 6µg/m3 on Wednesday and 10 µg/m3 on Thursday, said SAFAR. PM10 was 14 µg/m3, against the safe limit of 60 µg/m3. It is expected to be 11µg/m3 on Wednesday and 16µg/m3 on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-cleanest-air-since-monitoring-began/story-fbaHW93206D3BWM1Wz7QpM.html
30-06-2020||Chandigarh||Gurugram school murder: HC denies bail to juvenile||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday refused to grant bail to a Gurugram juvenile accused in the murder case of a student of the same private school where he studied in September 2017. The boy is accused of slitting the throat of a Class-2 student in a bid to postpone exams. Initially, the probe was conducted by Haryana Police and a bus conductor was accused of murdering the child. Later, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) claimed that it was committed by the juvenile in question. He is in an observation home since November 2017. His bail plea is pending in the HC since November 2018. The high court bench of Justice Arvind Sangwan observed that the petitioner child is to be treated as an “adult” while deciding bail. Hence, there is ‘little scope’ for the court to invoke provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, which empowers the court to release a juvenile in conflict with law on bail.The petitioner had sought quashing of October 2018 order of principal magistrate, Juvenile Justice Board, Gurugram, and November 2018 order of additional sessions judge, Gurugram, vide which bail was denied. It was argued that trial has still not commenced. There are 127 prosecution witnesses cited in the list of witnesses and it will take long time in conclusion of the trial. The boy was not keeping well in observation home, the court was told. The CBI, meanwhile, had argued that petitioner is not suffering from any serious illness as opined by a medical board. Further, it was submitted that he belongs to a “very influential” family and the manner in which the state police had conducted the investigation, prior to its transfer to CBI, demonstrates that the family of the petitioner tried to transpose a conductor of the bus as an accused in place of the boy.The court, while dismissing bail plea, said the boy was not facing health problems as opined by medical board. The court also took note of the prosecution argument that certain witnesses are minors (including the sister of the deceased) and therefore, possibility of tampering the evidence cannot be ruled out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gurugram-school-murder-hc-denies-bail-to-juvenile/story-V1o1l5JKkUIGXiX9ZC1GgO.html

30-06-2020||Mumbai||Relief to Arnab Goswami as high court suspends FIRs against him||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday suspended the first information reports (FIRs) filed against the editor in chief of the news channel Republic TV Arnab Goswami. The court said no coercive action should be taken against Goswami till further orders.On April 22 and May 2, two FIRs were registered against Goswami at NM Joshi Marg and Pydhonie respectively, charging Goswami under various sections of the Indian Penal Code for making allegedly communal comments on his TV show.The division bench of justices Ujjal Bhuyan and Riyaz Chagla, responding to the writ petition filed by Goswami to quash the two FIRs, said, “Seventy years into our republic we cannot be seen to be skating on thin ice so much so that mere mention of a place of worship will lead to animosity or hatred amongst religious communities causing upheaval and conflagration on the streets. Subscribing to such a view would stifle all legitimate discussions and debates in the public domain.”Referring to observations made by the Supreme Court in Goswami’s case, the bench said, “India’s freedoms will rest safely as long as journalists can speak to power without being chilled by a threat of reprisal; free citizens cannot exist when the news media is chained to adhere to one position.”The bench noted there was no evidence to suggest Goswami had tried to cause public disharmony. “We cannot have the spectacle of a Damocles’ sword hanging over the head of a journalist while conducting a public debate,” said the court in its order.In its statement, Phoenix Legal, which represented Goswami, said, “Both FIRs now stand suspended until Arnab’s petition is disposed of finally. The police cannot take any action concerning them or any coercive steps against Arnab and his colleagues at Republic TV.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/relief-to-arnab-goswami-as-high-court-suspends-firs-against-him/story-KJi2sMts0WL6go24uAFpMK.html
30-06-2020||Mumbai||Focus on China, not Opposition parties: Shiv Sena to Centre||The Shiv Sena took on the Centre and said that instead of giving a befitting reply to China for infiltration the Indian border and martyring soldiers, the Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi-led government is focusing on responding to Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Tuesday said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress’s war of words is on at a time when China is building its army at the border. It added that “like the ‘coronavirus caller tune’, somebody should run a tune that ‘we have to fight China and not opposition parties’”.The Sena also took potshots at Union home minister Amit Shah and said that he should focus on combating Covid-19 and not pay attention to what the opposition parties are saying about China.“The Chinese troops infiltrated in Galwan valley and they are carrying out unauthorised construction. Instead of giving China a befitting reply, the government is giving a strong response to Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and the Congress party. Rajiv Gandhi Foundation got funds from China. On this, the Congress shot back saying PM Cares got funds worth crores from Chinese companies. The Chinese are building bunkers and tents at the border and here BJP-Congress is on. It seems we have forgotten that we have to fight the Chinese,” the editorial said.The Shiv Sena backed Rahul for questioning the government on the violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops that martyred 20 Indian soldiers earlier this month. In a barb aimed at the BJP-led Central government, the Sena said, “Who is indulging in politics [over the Chinese infiltration]? Rahul Gandhi’s questions are not just bubbles in the water. Perhaps, Sharad Pawar also has the same queries. If China hasn’t intruded on our land, why were the 20 soldiers martyred?”Referring to Shah’s comments that the country will win battles against Covid-19 and against China under PM Modi’s leadership, the Sena said, “We wish Mr Shah the best. He should focus on the two battles. The government should not [focus] on the opposition party. There is no need to be rattled by questions raised by the opposition party.”The editorial added that there is no need to debate what happened in 1962, and said that we should “forget the past” and tackle the “fresh crisis”. “Whether it was Nehru or Modi, China will never change,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/focus-on-china-not-opposition-parties-shiv-sena-to-centre/story-mdDROwIAAYcfcIXfjiTwiL.html
30-06-2020||Gurugram||For doctors, distanced reality with family is the new norm||The last time Dr Sushila Kataria had a proper sit-down meal with her family was in February this year.Kataria, a frontline Covid-19 doctor and head of internal medicine, Medanta Hospital, has been staying in a separate room in her house and isolating herself ever since cases of coronavirus started emerging in the city. “I live in a separate room with a different entry and exit. My children have their own rooms. I don’t go to their rooms and even avoid touch common surfaces, such as door knobs. My children and husband eat together, while I eat by myself. While we are living under the same roof, it’s almost like to living in different houses,” said Kataria, who worked closely with the 14 Italian tourists who were treated for Covid-19 in March. She continues to work in a Covid isolation ward and follows a strict sanitisation process before she enters her house.Even as professional responsibilities take precedence over all other tasks for Kataria, she struggles to keep a tab on her teenage children, who have been cooped up at home since the country went into a lockdown in March this year. “My children are not going to school or stepping out. Most of their time is spent alone at home, fiddling with one or more gadgets that they own. I’m unable to keep a close watch on their studies or digital consumption. It worries me since I don’t get the chance to talk to them or have a heart-to-heart conversations as before,” said Kataria.Even after four months of living with the virus, doctors like Kataria — who have been at the frontline of tackling the spread of Covid-19 — continue to miss their lives before the pandemic took over. They live with an overwhelming sense of fear about contracting the virus and spreading it further among their family members. Juggling medical responsibilities and their chores at home was no mean task, most said. On National Doctor’s day, Hindustan Times spoke to doctors on the frontlines of the coronavirus health crisis who shared how they were treading a fine line while juggling professional duties with family responsibilities.“I miss hugging my children as a social distance needs to be maintained. My daughter often wonders why I need to be out all the time and if someone else could perform the duty on my behalf. Every now and then, she asks when the pandemic would get over and I tell her that it will take a while,” said Kataria.In the past four months, Kataria has been tested for Covid on four occasions. Doctors are advised to get tested every time they suspect of having contracted the virus. “Sometimes, body aches and headaches start happening. When such symptoms start appearing, we get tested since there is a fear of contracting the virus. So far, I have been tested four times and have been very lucky,” she said.Dr Manoj Goel, director, pulmonology, at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, said that both work and life for the past four months have revolved around coronavirus. With an extension of working hours and off duty hours being dedicated to monitoring patients, the virus had upended life like never before. In the initial months of the pandemic, Goel stayed at the hospital for two weeks straight, without seeing his family . During this period, he only managed to call them up occasionally to check on their well being. “I used to call them whenever I got time.Now, my family understands that this situation demands my presence much more,” Goel.He said that while the family was complying with physical distancing norms without any compromises, the real challenge was getting used to living with the virus at all times. “Work continues even after I return from the hospital. There is no time for entertainment or recreational activities with the family. Patient’s safety and other concerns keep us engaged all the time. My son who studies in the USA is currently at home but we don’t get the chance to spend time together,” said Goel.Dr Naveen Kumar, nodal officer and in-charge of the Covid-isolation ward at the civil hospital, said that staying away from family in the initial months of the pandemic was tough. For one and half months, Kumar stayed away from family in a government-provided accommodation. During this duration, he relied on video calls to stay in touch with his wife and 14-year-old son. “Video calls helped a lot during that time. Occasionally, I would stand below my house and speak to my son through the balcony,” said Kumar, who is back home and is adopting strict physical distancing measures. While he gets to see his family members more, free-flowing conversations are a thing of the past for now.“I am among those doctors who have the maximum exposure with patients. There is always a fear that one might end up infecting someone else. I sanitise myself before entering the house. The shoes, clothes, everything is changed before I enter. I make sure that no one else uses the car that I travel in,” said Kumar, adding that personal safety was absolutely important to avoid the virus. “We need to take care of the patients, ourselves, and by extension our families. One can never know when we might contract the virus,” said Kumar. “The virus has changed everything. I talk to my son, but avoid playing hanging out or doing activities with him that involve physical contact. This new distanced-reality is here to stay for now and we are gradually getting used to it,” said Kumar.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said that the administration was providing accommodation to healthcare workers, who could opt for the facility if they had any concerns with respect to spreading the virus among family members. Yadav said that all possible steps were being taken for the frequent sanitization of hospital premises and doctors had been provided with protective gear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/for-doctors-distanced-reality-with-family-is-the-new-norm/story-JZJxuSCtEhoid1zVVIwBOL.html
30-06-2020||City||5 held for extorting Palghar tribals over land compensation deal for gas pipeline project||Five persons have been arrested by the Manor police for allegedly cheating and extorting large amounts of money from tribals, with the promise of a good deal in compensation for their land to be acquired for the ₹1,500-crore gas pipeline project in Palghar. The economic offences wing (EOW), Palghar, has now taken over the case.Pradeep Pardeshi, deputy superintendent of police (DySP), EOW, Palghar, said the five accused – Madhukar Sakharam Kakra, Narayan Dable, Rupesh Patil, Doshiram Ghatal, and Janu Rama Mor – have been arrested for allegedly extorting 35% commission from the tribals, with the promise of getting them a better deal during the acquisition of land for the gas pipeline project. “So far, around 14 farmers have complained to us and we are expecting more complaints in this case,” said Pardeshi.“At a meeting held at a roadside dhaba on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway, the accused assured the tribals that they would get them a better deal from the said company in return for a 35% commission and to cover ‘expenses’ incurred for the land deal compensation,” said Pardeshi. The farmers who agreed to sell their land for the gas project started to get their compensation in January 2020 by the gas authorities.However, some of the victims did not pay the accused, so the latter went to their houses and allegedly threatened them till they paid the commission. “We have arrested the five under section 420 (cheating), 384 (extortion), and 385 (putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). All the accused are in police custody till July 3. More arrests, including those of some government officials, are also likely,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/5-held-for-extorting-palghar-tribals-over-land-compensation-deal-for-gas-pipeline-project/story-enEAx3Jbv3MYLnNLjUaZ6M.html

30-06-2020||City||HSVP proposes to double income limit of EWS patients for treatment in pvt hospitals||Gurugram To provide relief to patients belonging to economically weaker section (EWS), the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) has proposed to double their income limit from ₹5,000 to ₹10,000 per month for getting treatment in private hospitals. Officials said that the objective is to ensure that more people from EWS category become eligible for treatment in private hospitals, which have been allotted land at concessional rates by the authority. The proposal was made during a recent meeting of HSVP and health department with top private hospitals in the city. During the meeting, HSVP officials also suggested that the cost of medicines should be capped for such patients and preferably generic medicines should be prescribed so that they can bear the expenses of medical treatment, especially in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.At present, any person having a BPL card, class IV employee of Haryana government or undertaking, or any other person having monthly income not more than ₹5,000 is considered as belonging to EWS category and entitled to concessional treatment in private hospitals.The meeting on Friday was chaired by Jitender Yadav, administrator, HSVP, Gururgam, in which representatives from private hospitals, which have taken land from HSVP, were present. “We will take up the proposal of increasing the EWS criteria from ₹5,000 to ₹10,000. It will help the weaker section,” said Yadav, adding that the reason for these measures is that even the discounted bill for treatment is beyond the payment ability of such patients.As per the HSVP policy of allotment of land at concessional rates to hospitals, outdoor patients of EWS category shall be provided free treatment, and for indoor patients 10% beds shall be reserved free of cost for such patients. Also there shall be subsidized rates for in-patient treatment of EWS people, said the officials.Vivek Kalia, estate officer II, HSVP, also directed the hospitals in the meeting to share composite data of EWS/BPL patients attended from January 2020 till June 2020. The data shared by the health department revealed that three large hospitals in Gurugram treated 2,368 patients belonging to the EWS category during the said period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hsvp-proposes-to-double-income-limit-of-ews-patients-for-treatment-in-pvt-hospitals/story-NBeqMLKkYyrvMIWFJmi3YJ.html
30-06-2020||Mumbai||MSEDCL offers 2% discount on lump sum bill payment||Consumers who pay their June bill in a lump sum will get a discount of 2%, state energy minister Nitin Raut announced in a press conference on Tuesday. Additionally, he said that if Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) consumers pay even 1/3rd of their bill, supply will not be disconnected and they will have the facility to pay their bills in three instalments.“Those who have already paid their bills in total will also get a 2% discount,” Raut said. The state announced these incentives following thousands of complaints registered by consumers regarding inflated bills.Raut said that consumers can also register their complaints by writing to energyminister@mahadiscom.in or call, WhatsApp or SMS on 9833567777 and 9833717777. “The complaints will be resolved immediately. We are reaching out to consumers by arranging meetings in societies, via local radio, webinars, sending messages, and even on Facebook Live,” the minister said. Consumer grievance cells have also been set-up at all divisions to address queries.On Tuesday, Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray tweeted that the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has directed power companies to show transparency in their billing procedures and redress consumer complaints immediately.Following a rising number of complaints, the power regulatory authority issued directives to the utility firms on Monday. In a statement released on Monday, MERC said that if one’s bill is more than double the average for the amount charged from March to May, consumers should be given the option of dividing the payment into three monthly instalments. It has also asked utility firms to “set-up a robust monitoring mechanism” like a dedicated help-desk or a grievance officer at all sub-divisional and divisional offices to address queries from consumers within a day of their receipt. The power supply cannot be disconnected until consumers have been given the option of EMIs, and their grievances are redressed, MERC stated.Owing to the lockdown, actual meter reading was disconnected in March-end, following which consumers were billed on average consumption based on three months prior to March 2020, which were winter months. Utilities started actual meter reading in June, following which consumers were sent bills based on actual consumption in March, April, and May, which were summer months, and also when people stayed home owing to the lockdown, the companies stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/msedcl-offers-2-discount-on-lump-sum-bill-payment/story-AKrjVUjcSUKvCGRi3DrWSK.html
30-06-2020||Chandigarh||Cabinet divided over civic body polls, Capt says it can’t be delayed||The Punjab cabinet is divided over the schedule for the ensuing civic body polls in the state even as chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh said that the elections cannot be delayed beyond a point.A section of the cabinet is in favour of early polls in August, while the rest feel that it should be delayed for as long as possible.The terms of nine municipal corporations and 117 municipal councils and notified area committees in Punjab came to an end between March 8 and April 26 this year, and as per the provisions of the Municipal Act, 1911, the polls should take place within six months, so all these civic bodies should go to the polls between September 7 and October 25, depending on the end of their terms. Currently, the civic bodies are being run by government- appointed administrators.The state government had, in February, announced that the polls will held in June and July, but the entire schedule went haywire due to Covid-19 outbreak.MINISTERS’ TAKE Cabinet ministerTript Rajinder Singh Bajwa was of the opinion that the polls should be held early and if not that, it should be conducted in time. “But we should also keep in mind that we are passing through a pandemic and safety comes foremost,” he said.Cabinet minister Vijayinder Singla suggested that the polls should be conducted in November, as, according to him, the development works would be complete by then and the government’s candidates would be in a commanding position.To this, Bharat Bhushan Ashu said development works can’t be undertaken in monsoon so it’s best to complete the tendering process, make a public perception and go for polls in September.Cabinet minister Sukhjidner Singh Randhawa, said, “Don’t delay the polls as once the deadline lapses, it would be a lengthy process of bringing an ordinance and the Vidhan Sabha will have to approve it. We should face the polls as soon as possible.”Stating that the polls should be conducted within the legal framework, the CM asked a committee, comprising Mohindra and Bajwa, to bring a consensus within the party and take a decision. “I will discuss the matter with the chief minister again and after nod of the cabinet, decision will be taken,” said local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra. The decision is expected later this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cabinet-divided-over-civic-body-polls-capt-says-it-can-t-be-delayed/story-vncvMcSSsA4NzK7DiH5qrI.html

The CM claimed that the situation was better in Haryana than several other states and most of the people had returned to their workplaces. He said the state government was committed to follow the directions issued by the Union government during the ‘Unlock 2.0’ and schools would remain closed till July 31. About the movement of roadways buses, he said the decision will be taken after a review meeting as of 4,500 buses, only 850 were on the roads now. On the ban imposed on certain Chinese apps, Khattar said the government took the decision following public sentiment as there was resentment against China over the killing of Indian soldiers. “The discussion for peace should continue, but the integrity of our country is the top priority,” he added. ‘CONG-RULED STATES SHOULD CUT FUEL PRICES FIRST’Reacting over the Congress’ nationwide protests over the hike in fuel prices, Khattar said, “Congress governments in Rajasthan and Punjab should reduce the prices of fuel first as petrol and diesel are cheaper in Haryana than the neighboring states with the Congress in power.”He justified the hike by saying, “We are taking money from wherever we can for the welfare of people.” He said the state government was spending Rs 4,500 crore as committed expenses every month to provide relief to people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-ready-to-follow-unlock-2-0-guidelines-cm/story-RlfGuPO9hCIXVkveUcoZdL.html

30-06-2020||Gurugram||Court rejects the bail plea of teenager suspected of murdering his schoolmate||The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday dismissed the bail petition of a teenager accused of slitting the throat of a Class 2 student of a private school in Gurugram in September 2017. The court upheld the orders passed earlier by children sessions court and Juvenile Justice Board(JJB) that rejected the regular bail applications of the suspect. A bench comprising Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan has observed in a 31-page judgment that several witnesses in the case are minor, including the sister of the deceased, and therefore the possibility of tampering with evidence cannot be ruled out. The bench also observed that the suspect must be treated as an adult as per the order of the Supreme Court passed on February 22, 2019, and there is a little scope for the court to grant the concession of bail. “The heinous crime has been committed and therefore the court is declining the bail(sic),” stated the order.This was the 16th time that bail was denied to the teenaged suspect within the last 28 months. Earlier in May 2019, he was shifted from an observation home in Faridabad to a ‘place of safety’ in Madhuban, Karnal.The court also stated that the delay in the trial is attributable to the suspect and that it cannot be a ground on which bail can be granted.The father of the 18-year-old, who was a juvenile at the time of the incident, had filed an application on November 20, 2018, seeking a regular bail for his son and on June 8, 2020, filed another application, stating that his son has already suffered incarceration for over two years and six months. “If he, after preliminary assessment is treated as a juvenile for the purpose of the Act and offence, the maximum sentence that can be imposed upon him is three years. In such a situation, considering that he has already undergone two years and six months, no useful purpose would be served by his continued incarceration and the same would be a violation of his fundamental rights under Article 21 of the Constitution of India (sic),” stated the application filed by the father.The counsel for the suspect argued that the trial has not started due to the status quo order passed by the Supreme Court. Accordingly, a further delay in the conclusion of the trial is inevitable, since the prosecution has sought to examine 127 witnesses on its behalf. Further investigation is still underway and the courts are functioning only to a limited extent due to outbreak of Covid-19. This is a ground for the grant of bail to ensure that the suspect does not “unjustly languish” in custody any more, argued the counsel of the teenage suspect.After hearing the arguments of both sides, judge Arvind Singh Sangwan dismissed the bail application. “The arguments raised by learned senior counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner is not kept in a congenial atmosphere at Children’s Home and is facing medical problem, are not proved from the two reports of the Medical Board stating that the petitioner is not facing any serious problem/illness and rather it is noticed that the petitioner is gaining weight (sic),” stated the order.Sushil Tekriwal, counsel for the father of the victim, said that the rejection of bail in the case will make it stronger and ensure justice. “Granting bail can hamper the case and can turn witnesses hostile. The witnesses who are minor, including sister of the deceased, are also at risk if the suspect is granted bail. This is our major concern as trial is yet to begin,” he said.The father of the victim said they have been demanding speedy trial but despite the passage of over two years, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has not been able to file the supplementary charge sheet necessary for the trail to begin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/court-rejects-the-bail-plea-of-teenager-suspected-of-murdering-his-schoolmate/story-joqHFUHPMXGhnikye5kaAM.html

30-06-2020||City||68 found positive in antigen testing drive||Gurugram The health department on Tuesday started its large-scale antigen testing drive in the district, with 991 tests conducted across various containment zones in Dundahera, Sukharali, Ram Nagar, New Colony in Sector 7, Shivaji Nagar, Hiranagar and Sadmata Mandir. While 68 individuals tested positive for Covid-19 via antigen tests, 93 samples from symptomatic people are being retested using the RT-PCR method before a diagnosis can be made, health officials said.The special drive will last till July 14, during which at least 8,000 antigen tests will be conducted in Gurugram. The health department has deployed at least 20 lab technicians across 11 antigen test camps where people (from the area) can get themselves tested for free, said Dr Jai Prakash, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme’s district surveillance officer (DSO) in Gururgam.“We had introduced antigen tests a week ago when 50 tests were done in Sadar Bazar area and 100 in Gandhinagar. This week, we are scaling up the effort. We have also hired additional lab technicians for this exercise. Other than in hotspot areas, antigen testing camps are also being set up in Wazirabad, Chama, Khandsa and Rajiv Nagar,” Prakash said.Approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), antigen tests detect a specific protein associated with the Sars-Cov-2 virus, the pathogen that causes Covid-19. ICMR guidelines advise that negative samples, particularly those of patients showing symptoms, be retested via the RT-PCR method for a diagnosis. “Accordingly, 93 negative samples are being retested because the patients were showing Covid symptoms. We will get their results from the lab tomorrow,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram.Explaining the antigen testing methodology, Dr Prabhakaran Dorairaj, vice-president (research and policy) at the Public Health Foundation of India, said, “It is a confirmatory test which looks for presence of the virus itself, unlike rapid antibody tests which detect only antibodies produced by the immune system. So, the antigen test is a better diagnostic tool, but it can also produce more false negatives than the RT-PCR method. It is high on specificity, but low on sensitivity.” According to the experts, the ICMR validated kits -- which are being manufactured in Manesar -- are up to 99% specific, indicating that most positives will be ‘true positives’. However, they have a lower sensitivity, between 50.6% to 84% (depending on the patient’s viral load), meaning those who test negative might still carry the virus. This is known as a ‘false negative’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/68-found-positive-in-antigen-testing-drive/story-7ssGnUOxn6P6dweMtBi1yH.html
30-06-2020||Mumbai||City’s rain in June was lowest for the month in 5 years: IMD||Though parts of Mumbai witnessed intense showers on Monday night, overall rainfall in June has been lowest in five years as the city fell 110mm short of its average. On Tuesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a yellow alert (be updated for heavy rain at isolated places) for Mumbai and Thane, from Wednesday to Saturday.Heavy overnight rain (between Monday 9.30pm and Tuesday 8.30am) helped south Mumbai reduce its monthly rain deficit. Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 524.5mm between June 1 and June 30 (8.30pm), which is 16.4mm short of the station’s average rainfall for the month.However, Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 395 mm rain between June 1 and June 30 (8.30pm), which was 110 mm short of the average rainfall for June (505 mm). The suburbs ended the month with a rain deficit of 22%.According to IMD, June rainfall was 515.1mm in 2019; 792.5mm in 2018; 523.2mm in 2017; 695.2mm in 2016; and 1,106.7mm in 2015. Director general of IMD Mrutunjay Mohapatra said, “Weather systems along the west coast are strengthening monsoon currents and above normal rain is expected in July and August.”In June 2014, Mumbai witnessed its lowest rainfall reading in 10 years (87.3mm) while the second lowest was in June 2012 (298.5mm). The all-time lowest June rainfall was in 1972 (0.2 mm).On Monday, an intense spell of rain for almost two hours led to several areas in south and central Mumbai recording three-digit rain figures. However, there was less rain in the suburbs. Between 8.30am Monday and 8.30 am Tuesday, Colaba recorded 101mm rain while 11.2mm rain was recorded in Santacruz. IMD classifies 2.5-7.5 mm as light rain; 7.6-35.5mm as moderate rain; 35.6-64.4mm as rather heavy rain; and 64.5-124.4 mm as heavy rain.“Monsoon systems do have embedded mesoscale systems (microclimate characteristics), which give intense rainfall at highly localised places. This happened on Monday night and continued with intermittent light to moderate showers in south central Mumbai but since cloud bands were over this region, there was less rain over the suburbs,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-s-rain-in-june-was-lowest-for-the-month-in-5-years-imd/story-wIIekK1KHOBnDIMIlSH1JL.html
30-06-2020||Gurugram||Enforcement wing officials of MCG to check violations as malls in Gurugram reopen||To ensure that safety measures are being followed in the city malls that are slated to open on Wednesday after a gap of over three months, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has assigned 80 of its enforcement wing officials across its four zones to keep a lookout for possible violations, said officials of the civic body. The Haryana government on Sunday issued an order, detailing a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the reopening of malls in Gurugram and Faridabad. As per the order, municipalities have been directed to “monitor compliance by undertaking regular visits” to malls and to ensure that proper sanitisation of the premises are being carried out. The MCG officials have also been given the power to issue challans of ₹500 to visitors for failing to wearing to wear masks. As per the guidelines, the officials are also supposed hand out five masks to violators. As per MCG joint commissioner Hariom Attri, the enforcement wing officials in each of MCG’s four zones will be randomly conducting checks at all the malls in their respective jurisdictions and will accordingly issue penalties if any violation of the guidelines listed in the SOPs is found. This is not the first time that the enforcement wing of the MCG has carried out such an exercise. As per Attri, since April, eight teams comprising officials of the MCG’s enforcement and sanitation wings have been keeping a lookout for violations of lockdown norms and the guidelines listed in the SOPs for markets and stand-alone shops. Attri, however, added that the responsibility for malls has been exclusively assigned to the enforcement wing as its officials have better “technical knowledge” in the matter.“Monitoring in malls is not limited to violations relating to wearing of masks and social distancing norms. There are numerous other factors that need to be monitored. As officials in the enforcement wing are more familiar with such matters, we have therefore assigned them with this responsibility,” said Attri.Attri further said that the MCG at present has not put together any specific teams for keeping a check on the malls. Instead, the officials of the enforcement wing engaged in checking violations of SOPs in markets have been directed to keep an eye on the malls in their respective jurisdictions. “Based on the initial public response to the news of reopening of malls in Delhi, we are expecting a low footfall in the initial few weeks in Gurugram as well. As such, no separate teams have been constituted for this task. However, if the footfall is higher or sees a gradual increase over the next few weeks, we will allocate more officials for this task,” said Attri.The MCG held separate meetings with mall associations over the last three days and cautioned them that repeated violations of the SOPs might attract strict penalties. The SOPs lay down a list of rules that must be followed by the mall authorities. As per the rules, malls can only be open between 9am and 8pm daily, while cinema halls, gaming arcades and play areas for children will continue to remain close. All visitors and malls workers need to wear masks and maintain social distancing. Visitors above the age of 65 and below the age of 10 cannot be permitted entry. Mall authorities will also have to ensure that every visitor is scanned for temperature via thermal scanners and that hand sanitisers are placed at all entry points. They need to also ensure that large gatherings or congregations do not take place, while the temperature setting of all air-conditioners within the mall premises should be set between 24-30 degrees Celsius.In shops and food courts, less than 50% of the seats need to be occupied, while staff and waiters in food courts will have to mandatorily wear masks and hand gloves.“On both Monday and Tuesday, we have undertaken extensive disinfecting and sanitising operations. Our staff members have been directed to follow the requisite safety measures and also ensure that visitors do the same,” said Aman Bajaj, a member of MGF Metropolitan Mall association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/enforcement-wing-officials-of-mcg-to-check-violations-as-malls-in-gurugram-reopen/story-Hy25K2xEpv5d9N96z3UJYL.html

Special directions issued for the six districts under the Meerut division stated that night curfew here will remain imposed from 8pm to 6am.The decision for the imposition of extended night curfew timings was taken in the wake of the rising number of Covid-19 cases. The Meerut division comprises the six districts of Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, Baghpat, Meerut, Bulandshahr and Hapur, and is considered one of the regions most affected by Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh.“The respective district officials will promulgate prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in their areas and ensure that there is strict compliance. Night curfew, barring in the Meerut division, will be in place from 10pm to 5am in the state. In the Meerut division, night curfew will be in place from 8pm to 6am,” the directions issued by UP chief secretary RK Tiwari stated.In a recent order on June 25, the divisional commissioner (Meerut) issued revised night curfew timings from 8pm to 6am. Earlier, the timings were from 9pm to 5am.The Centre, on Monday, had issued guidelines for the second of a three-phase plan aimed at lifting nationwide restrictions imposed to stop the spread of Covid-19. The Centre announced that educational institutions, Metro rail services and large gatherings would remain banned, even as night curfew timings were relaxed by an hour to aid economic activity.The Union home ministry released the plan, called Unlock 2, to encourage more activities in areas outside containment zones. The new guidelines issued by the Centre will come into effect from July 1. Schools, colleges and coaching institutions will remain closed till July 31.The UP government also followed suit with restrictions on the reopening of schools, colleges, educational/coaching/training institutions till July 31. However, the order said that the provision of online classes/distance education will continue as per previous orders.The order also said that there will be no intra- or inter-state restriction on movement of persons or goods/commodities. But it also clarified that activities outside the containment zones can be restricted on the basis of evaluation at the local level.The order also authorised the officials of Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad districts to review the movement of commuters. The two districts, of late, have restricted movement to neighbouring Delhi, citing the rising number of cases.“The lockdown will remain in place in containment zones and steps will be taken for prevention of the spread of infection in containment zones as per the directions of the government on June 23. The district magistrates will be required to notify the containment zones via websites and also forward the list to Ministry of Health & Family Welfare,” the order stated.The government has so far allowed the functioning of public and private offices in a graded manner, resumed limited passenger train services and domestic air travel, and allowed the conditional reopening of shops and marketplaces.

The project will be delayed by four months due to the Covid-19 pandemic, they said.The proposed elevated road will start from Sector 39/43 crossing and end at Sector 82 T-point. Once developed, the ₹467-crore elevated road will decongest major traffic in Noida’s Barola, Bhangel, and sectors 49, 45, 47 and 46, among other areas. The authority has started piling work at Sector 49 site of the project. “We need to build 143 pillars for the project. We started piling for one pillar near Sector 49 on Monday. We have a target to build this road in 24 months. We will try to complete it at the earliest. The work could not picked up pace due to Covid-19 pandemic in March,” said Mukesh Vaish, project engineer of Noida authority.The authority chief executive officer has directed the staff to enforce the social distancing rules at the site for safety purposes. “For the piling work, a few labourers are at the site as the work is being done with machines. But we are taking all precautions and following health department guidelines to implement social distancing at the site,” said Vaish.On March 3, the authority had roped in state-owned agency -- Uttar Pradesh Bridge Corporation -- for constructing the elevated stretch that will provide seamless connectivity to thousands of motorists who travel from Delhi side to the special economic zone (SEZ) in Phase 2 area and Sector 82. The UP Bridge Corporation in March had started mobilizing the workforce to start work at the site and also done barricading of the site. But the work was disrupted due to the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25 to prevent the spread of Covid-19. In 2012, the authority had for the first time conceived the idea of constructing an elevated stretch over DSC road. In May 2016, it prepared a detailed project report of the project. But work could not start due to fund crunch. The DSC road, earlier known as the Dadri Link Road, passes from Noida’s Gole Chakkar to Greater Noida’s Dadri town. The proposed elevated road will have exit and entry at Sector 100 so that new group housing societies located in sectors 107, 47 and 104, among others, can benefit from the project, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/work-on-5-5km-elevated-stretch-over-dsc-road-resumes-after-gap-of-three-months/story-lJWv2qqDAC6dhRHbJdO07O.html
30-06-2020||City||Greater Noida waives off penalty on late property registration||The Greater Noida authority on Tuesday said it will not levy any penalties on property allottees who failed to register flat, group housing project, or plots between March 22 and May 31, 2020, due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and the subsequent nationwide lockdown. The authority has also given additional time to allottees to clear their payments by July 15 to evade any penalty.“The Greater Noida authority charges a penalty if the property allottee has been unable to execute registry within the stipulated time. We have decided not to impose this penalty as due to the pandemic, execution of registry or any other work was not possible,” Deep Chand, additional chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority, said. “If the property allottees fail to get done their work done by July 15, then the authority is free to impose a penalty,” he added.The authority has the power to impose penalties if the registry of a flat, plot, or group housing project is not executed within the stipulated time frame. The authority can impose a ₹100 penalty on a per-day basis for delaying the registry of a flat 100 square meter in area, ₹50 per day penalty for a 50 square meter flat, and the penalty for late registry of all kinds of plots is 1% of the total cost of the plot, officials said. Apart from the late penalty, the authority will also not recover ₹100 per day fine from builders, individuals or industrial allottees who could not obtain occupancy certificate for their complete buildings or those who failed to execute the transfer of memorandum (TM)—a process required before execution of registry, officials added.Property allottees, however, said that the authority should give more time to them to execute registries and other works.“Even now, most of the staff at many government offices are not reporting to work due to the pandemic. The normal work at all offices, including the authority, is yet to be resumed. Therefore, we request that the authority must extend this deadline till December,” Alok Singh, former vice president, Sector Alpha 1 RWA (resident welfare association), said. “The Greater Noida authority should extend the deadline beyond July 15 to carry out jobs that were not completed due to the pandemic as normalcy at government offices is yet to be achieved. Property allottees need to be provided more time so that they don’t need to rush to government offices during this tough time,” said RK Arora, president, Uttar Pradesh chapter, National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO), a builders’ group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greater-noida-waives-off-penalty-on-late-property-registration/story-dbhDUoIUeBhgIyTn4KVGGJ.html
30-06-2020||City||Ghaziabad has highest number of active Covid-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh; total count touches 1,615||According to the state health bulletin released on Tuesday, Ghaziabad district has the highest number of active cases of coronavirus diseases (Covid-19) in Uttar Pradesh. Ghaziabad currently has a total of 822 active Covid-19 cases, closely followed by neighbouring district of Gautam Budh Nagar which has 776 active cases, as per the data released by the state control room.According to health officials, this is for the first time Ghaziabad has reported the highest number of active cases among all the 75 districts in the state. During the last 24 hours,151 new cases—the highest single-day spike reported so far— were reported in the district and four people succumbed to the infection. According to the daily bulletin, the district has reported a total of 1,615 cases which includes 55 deaths, 822 active cases and 738 patients discharged so far.Health officials said the number of discharged patients will also increase soon with the revised state guidelines.“These days cases are growing, and for the past one week they are growing at an average of about 60-80 cases per day, hence we have more patients undergoing treatment. We will see more people getting discharged soon as the guidelines have been revised, and an asymptomatic patient can be discharged from a Covid facilities after 10 days. However, rising cases are still a cause of concern as the number of daily cases is increasing everyday after Unlock 1 kicked in,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO).As per the new discharge guidelines issued by the state government on June 19, if asymptomatic patients show no symptoms, they can be discharged without undergoing any test on the tenth day from the date of their admission. Such patients will, however, have to remain in home quarantine for seven days after being discharged.As per the earlier guidelines, asymptomatic patients were being discharged only after their first report after treatment came negative. Before this, a Covid-19 patient needed two successive negative reports in order to get discharged.According to official figures, the number of active patients have been on a sharp rise in the district.Till April 30, the number of active cases stood at 33.33% of the total 66 cases. By May-end, the active cases stood at 22.29% out of total cases of 305. However, till June 30, the active cases have gone up to 50.89% out of a total of 1,615 cases.Against the rising number of Covid-19 cases, the Ghaziabad district at present has only 326 L1 category beds, 100 L2 beds, and 400 L3 beds.“The L1 category beds are getting occupied fast with rising numbers and we are trying to set up more L1 facilities.We are admitting L1 category patients to L2 and L3 hospitals due to the limited availability of L1 category beds,” the CMO said.In a related development, the state government issued directions to not provide ambulances to recovered patients for dropping them home after they get discharged from Covid-19 hospitals.“The provision of 108 ambulances dropping recovered Covid-19 patients have been shut down for now. We have received directions from the state government not to allow recovered patients to be dropped home in ambulances as we have limited ambulances. So, now patients will have to arrange for their own transport to go back home,” the CMO said.“Till now we had been allowing recovered Covid patients to go home ambulances, but it takes a lot of time and patients who need to be admitted to Covid hospitals were being picked up late. Hence, the state government had to take this decision,” CMO added.At present, the district has 16 ambulances operating under the 108 facility and 14 of these, including two advanced life-support vehicles, were used for ferrying Covid patients. The other 17 ambulances running under 102 schemes are meant for ferrying pregnant women.The discontinuation of home drop service for recovered patients would mean that majority of patients will have to travel on their own from L1 category hospitals at Sahibabad and Niwari. Of the two, L1 hospital at Niwari, which is the biggest government facility with 250-beds, is about 35-40km from areas like Khoda, Kaushambi and Indirapuram etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-has-highest-number-of-active-covid-19-cases-in-uttar-pradesh-total-count-touches-1-615/story-zC1CQF2CyPBl5Z7GSlIm1N.html
30-06-2020||City||Staff crunch a worry as Gzb told to collect 4,000 samples daily||The six districts of Meerut division have been assigned a target of conducting 4,800 RT-PCR tests and another 11,000 antigen tests per day from July 2 as part of a special 10-day drive.The special drive has been ordered by the Uttar Pradesh government for enhanced surveillance and tracking of Covid-19 cases across the state, with initial focus on six districts of Meerut.Ghaziabad district, which is already facing a shortage of healthcare workers, has been given a target of 1,000 RT-PCR tests and 3000 antigen tests per day. Apart from carrying out surveillance activities, the district officials have also been given task of collecting and testing 4,000 samples per day, which is a mammoth task considering the district’s current sample collection capability is about 450 for RT-PCR and 250-300 for antigen tests per day.“Our primary concern at the moment is that of resource crunch. We have just 30 lab technicians at present in the health department. One lab technician at the most can collect about 40-50 samples per day as the job involves preservation of records, numbering of samples and needs time. In such a case the health department would need at least 80 more lab technicians in order to achieve the target of 4,000 tests per day,” said an officer from the district health department.During the drive the teams conducting sampling will be focussing on ILI and SARI patients in containment zones as well as non-containment zones. Officials estimate that they will find about 5-10% influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) cases as a result of enhanced testing. “In such a case we would need more Covid facilities. Our present L1 category facility at ESIC Hospital (76 beds) and Divyajyoti Hospital (250 beds) are almost nearing saturation. If we conduct 4,000 tests, we will have more patients coming in and would immediately need more Covid hospitals to admit at least some of them. Further, we will also have sample collection points at RKGIT College and Ideal College, where we would require more doctors and staff,” the officer said.According to official records, Ghaziabad has received about 8,000 antigen test kits recently and testing using the kits started on June 26. Till, June 29, the officials said, they had conducted 952 antigen tests, out of which 84 people had tested positive for Covid-19.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls over the issue. Chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta, however, said that the issue of shortage of lab technicians for enhanced testing is being looked into.“We will definitely need more lab technicians to cater to 4,000 samples per day, as directed by the state government. For this, we are trying to get more technicians of them from private hospitals. At present we have about 28-30 lab technicians. We are also trying to open up one more L1 category hospital in Modinagar or Dasna in order to cater to more patients who are expected to arrive after testing is ramped up,” Dr Gupta added.He added that the district so far has been able to collect and test 18,500 samples overall, since March. This includes the samples tested by private labs too. “Apart from sampling teams there will be teams that are deputed to carry out door to door surveys in the entire district,” he added.Under the special surveillance drive, the Ghaziabad district as per a government order by UP chief secretary, has been tasked to form at least 2,058 teams, consisting two members each. Officials from the district said that they have put in place 2,500 teams for the drive.The teams will be visiting 75 households in a day for a period of 10 days starting July 2 and will scan residents having symptoms of ILI and SARI and will also note down details of people having comorbid conditions.“The special surveillance drive will get started on July 2 from Meerut division and will be taken up across the state. The teams will record symptoms and comorbid conditions of residents and marking will also be done at houses that are covered. It is a massive surveillance drive and will considerably help in early detection of patients with symptoms,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/staff-crunch-a-worry-as-gzb-told-to-collect-4-000-samples-daily/story-gOdLxrpguZhdZPvTEWkaVL.html
30-06-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER to start DM course in interventional radiology||The Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research is starting a three-year doctorate of medicine (DM) course, the first of its kind in north India, in interventional radiology from July 1“This is the first such course being started in north India. The only other hospital offering an advanced three-year DM course is the Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai,” said prof MS Sandhu, head, department of radiodiagnosis.Interventional radiology, an important subspecialty of radiology, allows minimally invasive procedures to be done quickly under minimal anesthesia. It’s relatively painless and can be done on an out-patient basis, prof Sandhu added. The procedures are performed through medical imaging guidance, such as X-ray fluoroscopy, computed tomography (sectioning through use of penetrative wave), magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound.The department has run an interventional radiology outpatient clinic for the last two years, something not done by any government hospital in the country.Such procedures are used for treatment of cancer patients who do not have the option of surgery due to technical factors or for comorbidities such as heart disease or advanced liver disease. Other important procedures that can be done with interventional radiology are blocking leaking blood vessels, treating aneurysms of blood vessels, opening up narrowed blood vessels, obtaining abnormal tissue for cytological or histopathological examination, drainage of infected collections and abscesses, drainage and stenting of obstructed systems in the biliary tree and urinary tract.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-to-start-dm-course-in-interventional-radiology/story-J7UgtdOyUKPJUlRLzwOjXM.html

The deadline has been extended due to rainy season.Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma, municipal corporation (MC) commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal and mayor Balkar Sandhu inspected the ongoing projects, including Jagraon Bridge, elevated road, Ladhowal Bypass and Jalandhar-Panipat highway (NH-44) on Tuesday.Sabharwal said, “The MC has directed the contractor to expedite the work, but it is difficult to complete the project by mid of August due to the ensuing rainy season. The bridge can be opened for traffic in the first week of September. However, the road would be developed with hot mix asphalt by end of September.” The project was first expected to complete by March, but it got delayed due to imposition of curfew. After the work restarted, the authorities claimed that it would be completed by July 30.In July 2016, the Railways had closed one leg of the bridge leading to traffic chaos in the city.Since then, residents have been pressurising the district administration to expedite the construction work of the bridge.‘EXPEDITE WORK ON PROJECTS’Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma has directed NHAI officials to submit a schedule of works to be taken up to expedite work on the projects, including elevated road, Ladhowal Bypass, etc.He also directed officials to resolve the issue of water accumulation at the Sherpur Chowk and Vardhman Chowk on the Chandigarh Road.Member, Punjab Road Safety Council, Rahul Verma, said, a storm sewer line has also been proposed to be built from the Vardhman Chowk to the Buddha Nullah to stop water accumulation at the chowk. Sharma also directed the officials to expedite the work of establishing foot overbridges at different sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jagraon-bridge-in-ludhiana-to-miss-another-deadline-may-be-completed-by-sept-end/story-tbXyx2Ga0RBFVPtpPW8sAM.html
30-06-2020||Chandigarh||NGO holds protest against imposition of dog/cat tax in Ludhiana||Barely five days after the municipal corporation (MC) levied the dogs and cats registration tax of Rs 400 per annum in the city, a number of protesters under the banner of Yuva, an NGO, staged a protest outside the Zone A office of the MC here on Tuesday. The protesters said the imposition of new taxes at a time when the common man is already reeling under economic crisis in times of coronavirus pandemic is unjustified.The protesters expressed their resentment through demonstrating a man on a stretcher depicting that the public is already on a ventilator (showcasing financial crisis). The MC had commenced the registration of pets in the city on June 25. Alleging that the MC has failed to provide any relief from the stray cattle and stray dog menace and water accumulation even when hefty taxes, including cow cess, water-sewer user charges, etc are being collected, the protesters rued that another burden has been put on the shoulders of residents by imposition of the pet registration tax. Kumar Gaurav, who heads the NGO, said, “Water accumulation is witnessed in old city areas every season and the authorities have also failed to provide relief from the stray cattle menace. The MC should not put a burden on the shoulders of residents at a time when many of the residents are struggling to make both ends meet.” MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “Registration of pets is for the benefit of the society as it will help the MC in differentiating between pet and stray dogs. Also, the MC will be able to identify its owner if any pet is found straying on roads. Meanwhile, all efforts are being made to deal with other issues, including rainwater accumulation, stray cattle and stray dog menace.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ngo-holds-protest-against-imposition-of-dog-cat-tax/story-zuBDXFn3HDfVESy2IaAPOO.html
30-06-2020||City||6 fatalities, 260 fresh Covid-19 infections in J&K||Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday recorded six deaths and 260 fresh Covid-19 infections, taking the total number of positive cases in the Union territory to 7,497, officials said.The death toll in the UT has reached 101 in 114 days.Five people died due to the virus in Kashmir and one person succumbed in Jammu division. A 23-year-old youth from Shopian and a 65-year-old woman from Srinagar died at the Chest Diseases Hospital while a 53-year-old man from Baramulla succumbed at Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Bemina. A 65-year-old Qamarwari man’s sample tested positive after his death at SMHS Hospital. “The young man from Shopian was an accident case with a serious head injury and was shifted from SMHS Hospital on Monday. The woman was having multiple ailments including hypertension and diabetes,” said medical superintendent Dr Saleem Tak.A relative of the Baramulla man said he had tested positive a few days ago and was very critical. “He had pneumonia and could not survive,” he said. In Jammu division, a 85-year-old woman died at Government Medical College (GMC) and hospital. “The woman, who hailed from Kathua district’s Basohli area, was hospitalised on June 25,” a senior doctor said. He said the patient was suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and was on a ventilator in the isolation ward. Of the total 101 deaths in J&K, 89 have been reported in Kashmir division while 12 people have died in Jammu division.Dr Nisar ul Hassan, a senior doctor representing a faction of Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK), on Tuesday said the coronavirus is killing more men than women in the Kashmir valley. “Nearly 72% of those who died from Covid-19 infection in the Valley were men while women accounted for 28% deaths,” he said. Dr Nisar said based on analysis from the data of all 88 deaths in Kashmir as of June 30, 63 (71.60%) were men and 25 (28.40%) were women. “70 percent of men who died were above 60 years of age and the average age was 62,” he added. Dr Nisar said 86% male deaths had pre-existing medical conditions with high blood pressure in 18 (28.57%) followed by diabetes in 10 (15. 87%), chronic lung disease in 8 (12.69%), cardiovascular disease in 6 (9.52%), cancer in 4 (6.34%) and chronic kidney disease in 4 (6.34%). Two had brain hemorrhage, one had chronic liver disease and one had hematological condition.“Nine patients (14.28%) had no underlying health issues and were apparently healthy,” he added.Dr Nisar said the gender disparity in death could be biological or behavioral. “Women have more robust immune system than men and are able to fend off infection. The female sex hormone appears to play a role in immunity, as does X chromosome which contains immune-related genes. Women carry 2 X chromosomes, men only one,” he said.He said men smoke at higher rates than women that damages the lung defense and increases the risk of severe infection. “Males are more likely to have medical conditions that can make Covid-19 more fatal for them,” he added.60 CRPF personnel test positiveAs many as 60 CRPF personnel are among the fresh cases reported in the UT on Tuesday.Of the total cases, 228 people tested positive in Kashmir and 32 in Jammu division. Among these, 22 patients have a travel history.Active cases in J&K stand at 2,674 after 137 more patients recovered on Tuesday. “22 people were discharged in Jammu division and 115 in Kashmir,” a government statement said.So far, 4,722 people have been cured in the UT, taking the recovery rate to 62.9 %. Of the total recovered, 3,564 are in Kashmir and 1,158 in Jammu division.The highest jump in positive cases was reported from Kulgam district where 64 more people tested positive followed by Srinagar at 46 and Baramulla at 44. In Jammu division, the highest jump was in Jammu district where 12 more people tested positive.Till date, 2.81 lakh people in contact with suspected cases have been put under surveillance — 39,866 in home quarantine, 36 in hospital quarantine and 46,912 under home surveillance. Besides these, 1.91 lakh people have completed their 28-day surveillance period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/6-fatalities-260-fresh-covid-19-infections-in-j-k/story-P3Unau4aIuU3w6eKnNP5hI.html

Rao will replace Muhammad Akil who has been promoted as director general of police (crime) and has also been given the additional charge of director, state crime records bureau.The two police officers were among 11 others who were transferred by the Haryana government on Tuesday.Rao, an Indian Police Service(IPS) officer of 1996 batch, has served as the commissioner of Gurugram police earlier for eight months ( between June 2018 and February 2019)— the shortest tenure of a commissioner in Gurugram—before being appointed the Faridabad police commissioner. As Faridabad police chief, he was also part of the team that arrested one of the most-wanted gangsters, Kaushal in August, 2019.During Rao’s tenure in Gurugram, the police had launched a major crackdown against the alleged prostitution rackets operating out of malls on the Mehrauli-Gurugram Road. Also, reporting of vehicle theft cases had gone down by 48% in Gurugram. “I plan to crack down on vehicle thefts and street crime and will ensure prompt action against extortionists. Speedy and fair investigations will be carried out in all matters that will be reported to us,” said Rao. He said the city police will plan a comprehensive strategy to track organised criminal networks and take strict action against gangsters who are active in the city.OP Singh, who was serving as the special officer (Community Policing and Outreach) in Chief Minister’s Office till now, will replace Rao as the new Faridabad police commissioner.The outgoing Gurugram police commissioner, Akil was the eighth police chief in the city since it adopted the commissionerate system of policing in 2007. Before his posting in the city in February, the 1989-batch IPS officer also served as additional director-general of police(law and order) holding the additional charge of chief vigilance officer. During his tenure in Gurugram, Akil focused on preventing crime in the city besides ensuring better law and order situation. Akil said while working in Gurugram he got the opportunity to observe things from a micro-level. “The tenure has been very challenging and fruitful. I tried to handle all the situations, even the unprecedented ones during the lockdown, tactfully with my experience for the betterment of the city and our police force,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/kk-rao-returns-as-gurugram-police-commissioner/story-XyYeN9cPNyMLmp6jyL6kqO.html

30-06-2020||Delhi||Jama Masjid to reopen from July 4||The historic Jama Masjid, which had closed earlier this month due to fears regarding a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city, will reopen for congregational prayers (namaz) from July 4, Shahi Imam of the mosque Syed Ahmed Bukhari said on Tuesday. The Shahi Imam said they are ready to reopen the mosque with all the safety protocols in place. Devotees will be requested to do wazoo (ablution) at home before coming to the mosque as well as bring their own mats, as the carpets have been removed for safety purposes.The mosque was closed on June 11 because of the “critical conditions” in the city (the rising Covid-19 cases) till June 30. The Shahi Imam had sought public opinion before deciding to close down the mosque. The move was prompted after his personal assistant Amanullah succumbed to the infection on June 9. “Even though the number of cases is still on the rise, the fear among people has kind of faded. People have now become familiar with the practices to keep the virus at bay. Also, they have now come to understand procedures to follow in case of infection,” Bukhari said.Except for the early morning namaz (Fajr), the remaining four namaz will be offered at the mosque. The early morning namaz cannot be conducted because of curfew timings between 9pm and 6am in the city, he added.Other mosques in the city, including the Fatehpuri Masjid, which had also followed the Shahi Imam’s decision to keep mosques shut till June-end, are yet to take a decision on the matter.“We had decided to keep the mosque shut till July 4 and so was the case with other local mosques. Since, unlike the Jama Masjid, we do not have a proper gate or a compound to regulate the entry of people, it is difficult to maintain social distancing if the doors are opened.

30-06-2020||City||Civil work contractors of North DMC threaten to stop work, demand dues||New Delhi: Civil work contractors of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation have threatened not to complete projects and refused to start work on new plans to protest against non-payment of bills amounting to approximately Rs 500 crore pending for over last five years.Representatives of the contractors’ union said they would adhere to the formula of “no money, no work” till their pending bills of various projects are cleared by the civic body. They said that due to financial challenges since lockdown, it has become difficult for them to continue work. Among projects that the contractors they have not been paid for include construction of lanes in Nabi Karim, Padam Nagar, Azad Market and renovation of MCD flats at Nani Wala Bagh in Azadpur. Officials said if the contractors strike work it may also delay repair of streets in areas across the city which is crucial to prevent flooding during monsoon. As per IMD, monsoon has already arrived in the city. The North corporation is the largest of the three civic bodies in Delhi. Its jurisdiction stretches from the Red Fort near Chandni Chowk in central Delhi to Narela-Bawana in north and northwest Delhi; and from Burari in North Delhi to Paschim Vihar in west Delhi. It has 24 assembly constituencies and two Lok Sabha constituencies. There are 500 civil work contractors who work for the north municipality. At least 1,000 labourers work under these contractors.“We are on the brink of starvation and not able to meet basic needs. Most of our bills after March 13, 2015 are yet to be cleared. Due to non-payment of our pending dues by the corporation, we are unable to look after our families. We have had written as well as talked to the civic authorities including the mayor, commissioner but nothing has happened. So, we have now decided to stop work and maintenance till our bills are cleared,” Gurmeet Singh Sethi, general secretary, Contractors’ Association of North MCD, said.To press for their demands, last week civil work contractors had also staged a demonstration at the Civic Centre — North Corporation’s headquarter.“Monsoon has already arrived and the maintenance work of broken streets and drains is still pending in areas such as Paharganj, Karol Bagh, Rohini among others. If contractors halt work then the situation may become worse during monsoon,” a north corporation official said who wished not to be named.The contractors are not the only ones demanding their dues from the civic body. Teachers, doctors, nurses and paramedical staff employed by the North Corporation have also complained that they were not paid their salaries for last 3-4 months.Sethi further said that contractors kept completing their work by borrowing money and material from suppliers in a hope that those pending dues would be cleared but it did not happen.“The last payment MCD released was of Rs 20 crore in February 2020 but that was a meagre amount against the pending dues of around Rs 500 crore. It did not serve any purpose. Now the situation is such that neither the supplier is lending us materials nor we are able to borrow from the market to complete pending works,” Sethi said.Jai Prakash, mayor North Corporation, admitted that bills are pending for long. He assured that the corporation was making efforts to clear bills.“We are aware about the situation and are in touch with our contractors. In the times of Covid-19 crisis we are first trying to ensure that coronavirus warriors are paid regularly. We are also arranging funds to clear pending bills of contractors as soon as possible,” the mayor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/civil-work-contractors-of-north-dmc-threaten-to-stop-work-demand-dues/story-Bdlly85CY91ZnosjrPB9tM.html
30-06-2020||Lucknow||After long struggle, footballer Rani gets AIFF certificate||The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has issued certificate of participation at the senior nationals to Uttar Pradesh’s woman footballer Varsha Rani. The move is significant in view of Rani’s fight against an alleged injustice meted out to her by the Uttar Pradesh Football Sangh (UPFS) last year.In May last, the UPFS’ secretary Mohd Shamsuddin had issued “very poor performance” remark on Varsha’s certificate of participation at the Senior National Championship held at Cuttack (Odisha) in October 2018 after she allegedly refused to meet an alleged ‘unethical demand’ of the UPFS official in Varanasi.“I am thankful to the AIFF, which honored my request and issued the fresh certificate,” Bareilly’s Varsha said on Monday. “I will continue my fight against my harassment by UPFS secretary.”Hindustan Times in 2019 had raised Varsha’s issue following which the AIFF had begun its enquiry and even sought a clarification from the UPFS. “The participation agreement is issued by AIFF and nobody has the right to put any comment on a participation certificate issued by the AIFF,” AIFF secretary-general Kushal Das had then said.Shamsuddin had justified his decision to write ‘very poor performance’ on Varsha’s certificate. “There has to be some punishment for poor performance. So, I wrote a comment on the certificates of players. It is justified, as I want everyone to know how bad their performance was at the nationals.”“Some girls in the team were playing politics and intentionally lost the match. I had no other option but to put my comments on the certificates of the entire team. The AIFF cannot stop me from writing on the certificates even if it is issued by them,” he said then.In fact, Varsha had accused Shamsuddin of ruining the careers of many women footballers in UP by writing unfavourable comments on their certificates. “I was asked to come alone to collect my certificate of participation. When I went to Shamsuddin’s place with my parents in Varanasi, my father was scolded and given the certificate only after I submitted an affidavit seeking apology. It was a big humiliation for me and my parents,” Rani had said in her letter to UP’s chief minister Yogi Aditynath.“Even before the national championship, I was humiliated and harassed by people close to Shamsuddin during the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Memorial State Championship in Gonda. Almost all the girls in the team were asked to humiliate me in public. I tried to raise my voice but everyone told me to compromise with the system as it’s been happening for the last many years,” she further states.Shamsuddin has earlier been accused of sexual abuse by a woman footballer in Varanasi in 2014 and was even taken into custody. A few players HT spoke to alleged that the functioning of the Sanjay Singh-led UPFS was dictatorial.“I have my own style of functioning and I find my comments on the players’ certificates as an act of punishment for their indiscipline and poor performance during the Cuttack tournament,” he said.Shamsuddin’s act of signing ‘very poor performance’ on Varsha’s certificate was criticized by the Uttar Pradesh Olympic Association too. “No one has the right to write on the participation certificate of a player when it has been issued by the national federation. AIFF did justice to the girl footballer and it’s a lesson to UPFS official,” said UPOA’s secretary Anandeshwar Pandey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/after-long-struggle-footballer-rani-gets-aiff-certificate/story-zCf9t8VpeNVKDhj7UJr3YP.html

30-06-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: Bharadwaj being looked after well by jail says NIA||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has opposed the plea of a lawyer and former professor Sudha Bharadwaj who is currently lodged in Byculla Women’s prison for her alleged involvement in the Elgar Parishad case. The NIA in its response to the application by Bharadwaj in the Bombay high court against the special court’s refusal to grant her interim bail has stated that Bharadwaj is using her comorbidities as an excuse to get interim bail during the pandemic. The NIA has assured that Bharadwaj is being provided with the medication she has been taking since the past 20 years for her diabetes and blood pressure and as the UAP Act under which she has been arrested, has no provision for bail, the special court’s refusal on May 29 was valid. The reply was to be heard by the court on Tuesday but due to paucity of time, the matter could not be heard and is expected to be listed for hearing on Friday.The NIA in its reply said that the medical condition Bharadwaj has referred to in her plea has no merit as she has been suffering from ‘some chronic illness’ since 20 years for which she is undergoing prescribed medication and she is being provided with necessary medical assistance in jail as the authorities have her medical records. “It is clear that the pleading concerning the medical condition of the petitioner is merely a ruse to obtain an order of interim relief which is not available to the petitioner otherwise on the merits of the case,” the reply states. The NIA has stated that as the evidence against Bharadwaj so far does not entitle her to seek any relief on any grounds including that of the pandemic.Bharadwaj had applied for interim bail before the special NIA court following the recommendations of the state-appointed high powered committee to release under-trials and convicts on interim bail and parole. The recommendations had however made an exception for under-trials and convicts who were incarcerated under special acts. However, after the special court rejected her application she approached the HC.In her appeal, Bharadwaj has said that as she is susceptible to the virus, she can be considered for interim bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-bharadwaj-being-looked-after-well-by-jail-says-nia/story-qFul0b5x656p8KYpSeXSsK.html

The court was hearing a plea which it had initiated itself over the non-payment of salaries to the teachers.The court asked the corporation to release the salaries of teachers for March, if they have received Rs 49.16 crore from the Delhi government for the month of June as stated by its additional standing counsel Avinish Ahlawat. A bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad asked the corporation to also file a status report with a tabulated statement indicating the amount required to disburse its share of salaries to teachers in the year 2021, the money released till the quarter ending June 2020 and the unpaid amount.The court on Friday had criticised the civic body over the non-payment of salaries to 9,000 teachers since March this year. The court, while hearing an appeal by the Akhil Dilli Prathmik Sikshak Sangh, had termed it as “a sorry state of affairs” and equated teachers to Covid-19 warriors as they have been put on Covid duty also.On Tuesday, Avinish Ahlawat told the court that the Delhi government had sanctioned a sum of Rs 49.17 crore for April to the North DMC as grant-in-aid to disburse salaries to civic body teachers for April 2020, under the Scheme of Primary Education, for the year 2020-21.Ahlawat said as far as payment for May 2020 is concerned, the finance department has sanctioned Rs.49.17 crore to the North DMC vide an order dated May 1. She said the release order for a sum of Rs 49.16 crore (for June) was issued only on Monday and in all probability, the amount would have been remitted into the civic body’s account.Appearing for the civic body, senior advocate HS Phoolka said they will have to ascertain if the sum  had been received by the corporation. He said the Delhi government had not released the amount for June. Phoolka said salaries for 9,000 teachers employed by the north corporation was released in February 2020 but for March 2020, only 5,400 teachers on Covid-19 duties had been paid because of paucity of fundsHe said salaries of the remaining 3,600 teachers had not been released for March 2020 and no salary had been paid to any teacher for three months, from April 2020 till June 2020.

The MoU was signed in the presence of Union minister of petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan, Union minister of power RK Singh, Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, SDMC mayor Anamika and SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti through video conferencing.Bharti said the project will address the problem of disposal of municipal solid waste. Under this project, the plant will process 50 tonnes per day of Refused Derived Fuel (RDF) segregated from municipal solid waste to produce Syn Gas. This Syn gas will be utilised to generate about 1MW electricity. “For this project, SDMC will provide one acre land in Okhla landfill site on lease to Indian Oil for setting up the plant. The south corporation will purchase the power generated from the plant at a mutually agreed rate. We will able to save an amount of Rs.2.6 crore due to the purchase of power from the proposed plant,” Bharti said in a statement.The commissioner further said that there would be an investment of 50% each by the Indian Oil and NTPC towards the capital cost in setting up of the plant through a consortium. Indian Oil will facilitate the technology for the plant and identify technology partner for Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) of the plant and will handle the operation of the proposed facility. The NTPC will facilitate technology review for electricity generation and evacuation.Union minister Pradhan also stated that Delhi generates 10,000 tonnes waste every day and it is a “daunting challenge” to manage and process the entire quantity of waste. He said that setting up such “relevant and much needed” plant will go a long way in the production of enriched organic manure, generation of electricity and treatment of effluent waste.Anamika, mayor SDMC, stated that the initiative will definitely help the municipality in achieving 100% waste processing. “In future, we will try to replicate such plants in other areas also. This plant is an indigenous solution for the problem of solid waste,” she said. Property tax date extendedThe South and the North Delhi Municipal Corporation have extended the date of submission of property tax with 15% rebate by one month till July 31, 2020. Officials of north and south corporations have said that the decision has been taken to facilitate taxpayers who could not deposit property tax availing the benefit of 15% for timely payment.

The next hearing of the case is on July 15.The court also observed that: “The video shown by the prosecution in the court, which was also one of the basis of registration of FIR, makes it look like an event organised by the police itself and even a green carpet has been laid out on the ground.”“When the firing event was organised by the police and police themselves helped the accused in firing weapons at a firing range, custodial interrogation of the accused is clearly not required,” the court said.The court further observed that it seems that only when the video was circulated on the social media, FIR was registered by the police to save their face.“Further perusal of the file reveals that the police are yet to get report from CFSL regarding authenticity of the video clip to the effect that whether it has been tampered/edited or not,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/interim-bail-to-sidhu-moose-wala-look-like-an-event-organised-by-police-observes-court/story-pjwiksvJLfDlPxHq1Oz6XK.html

The traders said that the civic body had earlier this month issued a notice and said that as per the Delhi Outdoor Advertisement Policy 2017, the traders will have to pay penalty for “unauthorised” advertisement in the market. A notice issued by NDMC said, “All advertisements in NDMC area are governed by Delhi Outdoor Advertisement Policy 2017...any unauthorised/illegal advertisement will attract penalty for each day...accordingly the NDMC has approved that the penalty may be levied on account of unauthorised advertisements till further orders.”An NDMC official said there were many locations in the market where illegal outdoor advertisements have been put up by the traders. “The order has been issued in accordance with the policy and levy penalty,” he said requesting anonymity.The New Delhi Traders Association (NDTA) said that there were no illegal advertisements in the market and it was a move to “realise money and harass” traders.Atul Bhargava, president NDTA, said that all signages in the market have been put up on private property in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Delhi Urban Arts Commission (DUAC) during the Common Wealth Games 2010. “There is no violation of rules while putting up signages against the shops and there were no illegal advertisements in the market by the traders. This is another way of harassing traders who are already witnessing tough times due to coronavirus pandemic. Earlier, they threatened us with sealing by issuing notices for sunken floors and now trying to harass us further on the pretext of unauthorised advertisements,” Bhargava said. He added that the civic body in its notice did not clarify dimensions of signages, LED screens or hoardings beyond which penalty would be incurred. “Last week, the NDMC staff has started an exercise of measuring signages and flex boards on our shops in the market. We have requested the NDMC authorities to provide more clarity on illegal advertisements and dimensions of flex boards, signages and LED screens. At present, we are not able to pay even Rs 100 fine as the condition of traders is really bad,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cp-traders-allege-ndmc-harassing-in-name-of-fine-for-illegal-ads/story-zU0DxS1VzfYU6eurPjn5hI.html

We had also conducted a meeting with the then LIT chairman Paramjit Singh Sibia (now dead) and he agreed with us. A case regarding the same is sub judice in the court, but the LIT officials also ignored the same while taking up the drive.” Balasubramaniam said, “The land belongs to the LIT as it was acquired in the 1950’s, but it has been encroached upon by a few residents for a long time. The LIT has received several complaints against encroachments in the past and the court has also ordered that the land belongs to the LIT.”He added, “We had received information that construction was being taken up in the area, following which we planned a drive.

30-06-2020||City||Punjab’s second Sainik School stuck in red tape||Chandigarh Punjab’s second Sainik School at Gurdaspur is stuck in red tape despite the availability of land and site survey.The new Sainik School at Dalla Gorian village of Gurdaspur district, which was proposed by the state government in December 2009, is getting delayed due to a logjam between the Union ministry of defence and the state government over completion of paperwork for the Sainik School at Kapurthala.The survey of the 40-acre site was carried out by the central ministry in June 2017 after it received a proposal from the present government. The Sainik School Society, the nodal organisation under the defence ministry for establishing and managing these prestigious schools across the country, had received the proposal from the state government in April 2017, according to information provided by the society under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005.It further said the matter is under consideration and yet to be finalised.“The site has been found suitable for opening the school with student strength of 250, but there has been no progress in the past three years. The state government and the ministry are stuck on signing of a memorandum of agreement (MoA) for Kapurthala Sainik School,” said two officials familiar with the matter.Sainik Schools are established on the specific request of the state government. The MoA is to be signed between the state government and the defence ministry on their roles and responsibilities, including financial support. The executive committee of the Sainik School Society had in 2017 decided not to open any new school in states where the agreement for the existing schools are pending.“As the MoA for the Sainik School at Kapurthala is pending, there has been no progress on the second school. The file is pending with the finance department for approval for more than one year,” one of the two officials said who did not want to identified.The Punjab government had agreed to sign the MoA with the defence ministry in 1996-97, but nothing happened. As per the funding pattern, the state government has to bear the entire capital expenditure on land, buildings, furniture and educational equipment, besides maintenance cost of buildings, roads, furniture, transport, etc and award scholarships on the basis of income of parents. Similarly, the Centre pays for the three service officers and instructors, awards scholarships to wards of defence personnel, including ex-servicemen, and awards NDA incentive to cadets who join NDA.The Kapurthala Sainik School, established way back in 1961 as a feeder institution for the armed forces, has 568 students currently. The school has been a source of pride for the state government with an impressive list of alumni. On June 13, seven of its students passed out from the Indian Millitary Academy in Dehradun, including the one who was awarded the Sword of Honour.At present, there are 33 Sainik Schools, including two new ones in Uttar Pradesh and Odisha this year, in the country, with eight states having two or more of these prestigious institutions. And, a fourth of the cadets who joined the National Defence Academy between 2016-17 and 2018-19 came from these schools.BUREAUCRATIC WAYS Conceived way back in 2009, new school at Gurdaspur held up due to delay in signing of memorandum of agreement (MoA) for the existing one at Kapurthala||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-s-second-sainik-school-stuck-in-red-tape/story-TZGwMFIHpEDrmIeFv0fxSP.html

A resident of New Colony in Ambala cantonment said power disruptions have become the norm for the last few weeks and there is no redressal of complainants. “There have been frequent power cuts in my area and an official said there is a fuse problem that is yet to be repaired. Power cuts at night are most frustrating. We have tried to call officials of the electricity department from the area but there is no response,” said Manoj, an employee with a local private company.Another resident from city’s Prem Nagar area, Dinesh Gulati, said power disruptions at night for the last three to four days are making their lives difficult.However, superintendent engineer Rakesh Khanna said these are not power cuts but transmission issues due to an accident near Baldev Nagar area. “Due to an accident near Baldev Nagar, we had to transfer the load to other areas nearby, which lead to some transmission issues. Generally, fixing such issues takes time and a fault in transfer affects nearly 300 homes connected to it. We have fixed this in Mahesh Nagar area and hope there are no more complaints,” he said. On being asked about increase in consumption, Khanna said, “Yes, there has been a slight rise in urban consumption over the last few days in both city and cantonment compared to last year. There is also an estimated rise of 30% to 40% in summers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/frequent-power-outages-give-ambala-residents-sleepless-nights/story-nyaB9pWRQP9y7vvYH8ch9H.html

30-06-2020||City||In ‘unsaid’ Bihar of PM speech, parties trade fire||PATNAPrime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement Tuesday to extend the Pradhanmantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) till November this year drew predictably mixed reactions from political parties in Bihar, where Assembly polls are, incidentally, due in October-November.Under the scheme, over 80 crore people in the country will get five kgs of wheat or of rice every month.Though the prime minister didn’t mention Bihar in his televised speech announcing extension of the scheme, he spoke twice about Chhath, considered the holiest festival in the state. During the festival that usually falls in October-November, most people from Bihar residing outside come home and stay for a few days. Besides, nearly 25 lakh migrant workers from Bihar, who were working in other states, have returned home since the countrywide lockdown was imposed on March 24 to check the spread of coronavirus. Though many have started going out again in search of jobs, a large section is expected to stay back, given the uncertain environment they find themselves in. Given their voting potential, political parties in the state have already started wooing them, raising the issue of hardships these they faced while returning home and their employment prospects.While the ruling NDA in the state hailed the PM's announcement, the Opposition alleged it was electoral gimmick.“PM Modi is seriously concerned for the poor of the country. It is a welcome step. The Congress and RJD should not view it through the prism of elections,” said BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand. “It’s a big announcement. This should not be linked to elections. It will benefit all over country and not only Bihar. Elections take place every five years,” said JD(U) spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan. RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, the Leader of Opposition in Bihar Assembly, said the ruling alliance was more concerned about elections. “There is no concern for Corona. Cases are increasing. They are only eyeing elections,” he said.Earlier, on June 20, Modi had launched Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan (GKRA), which is to run for 125 days across 116 districts in six states to help migrant workers get jobs in their home states. Bihar is the biggest beneficiary of the state as 32 out of its 38 districts have been selected based on the criterion that over 25,000 migrant workers should have returned back from other states.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had lauded the initiative and said it would compliment the state government’s own initiatives to ensure that no one requiring immediate work was left without work.Politics apart, observers say the extension of scheme for free foodgrains cannot be a substitute for employment for migrants who have returned, even though it may help woo them for votes. “There is another side of the picture too. The rush to make ration cards makes it clear these many people were deprived of it and exposes the system. The migrants need money and employment. Though foodgrains will help poor, it is yet to be seen how much of it translates into votes,” said political analyst D M Diwakar of A N Sinha Institute for Social Studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-unsaid-bihar-of-pm-speech-parties-trade-fire/story-rocXaNhLM10lY45nlwF48H.html

In a first-of-its-kind initiative, the police are clicking pictures of violators through drone cameras who will be identified with the help of area residents working as traffic volunteers, police informers and civic body employees. They would be warned of action through text messages.Around 102 WhatsApp messages have been sent to violators so far.Division Number 2 and 4 police stations have sent 97 messages to violators through WhatsApp and five messages were sent to those living in a containment zone.Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP-1) Deepak Pareek said, “The Ludhiana police are using drones to identify violators in containment zones. The drones can enter narrow lanes and provide a bird’s eye view. The footage, collected by drones, is continuously analysed by dedicated IT teams.”With the deployment of drones, the police will not have to enter the containment areas. There is also no physical contact. Initially, a warning would be served, but a repeated offender will have to face the music as challans will be issued to them,” said Pareek.As many as 20 cops, including DCP Ashwani Kapoor, were tested Covid-19 positive in June, following which the cops were instructed to follow the social distancing norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/drones-to-keep-an-eye-on-lockdown-violators-in-containment-zones-in-ludhiana/story-nSQsNFhfppoApJa3T2g6EI.html

Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram said, “All the warkaris, part of the procession, have tested negative and we have allowed them to go with the palkhi following social distancing norms and hygiene guidelines.”Lakhs of ‘warkaris’, or devotees of Lord Vitthal, from various parts of Maharashtra and some neighbouring states throng the temple in Pandharpur every year on the occasion of ‘Ashadhi Ekadashi’. However, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Maharashtra government cancelled the annual wari pilgrimage, which is characterised by people walking to Pandharpur with palanquins from various parts of the state.This year, the bus took the traditional route through Pune, Satara and reached Pandharpur in Solapur district. The warkaris accompanying the palkhis were seen wearing masks and played ‘taal and mridanga’ before the buses left. The roads in Alandi and Dehu from where the buses set off were lined with colourful ‘rangolis’.Earlier, the Solapur district administration imposed a curfew in Pandharpur from Tuesday ahead of ‘Ashadhi Ekadashi’, to prevent crowds from gathering to stop the spread of Covid-19.Milind Shambharkar, the district collector of Solapur, issued the order on Monday late evening and imposed restrictions on people’s movement in and around Pandharpur town from 2pm on June 30 to midnight on July 2 under the Disaster Management Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/tested-negative-warkaris-carrying-holy-padukas-leave-for-pandharpur/story-hYQPqIEKQ77ORXJ0i8CnMM.html

30-06-2020||City||Set up regulatory commission for price control in construction sector: J&K Apni Party||The Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party (JKAP) on Tuesday asked the government to constitute a regulatory commission to control unprecedented hike in prices of construction material which is giving a tough time to people besides hampering overall developmental activities across the UT.In a joint statement issued here, former legislators and Apni party leaders Mohammad Ashraf Mir and Abdul Rahim Rather have also demanded that a body of experts, including representatives of various construction material producing associations, should be formed to find tangible solutions to the issues faced by the construction sector.They said as compared to last year, there has been a record hike of at least 60% in costs of building materials like bricks, stones, sand, gravel and aggregate without any solid justification. “It is not the public only but the uncertainty in prices of raw materials that has badly hit the contractors who take up work based on a rate they foresee. The indiscriminate rise in prices of construction material may lead the common people and contractors into debt traps. This unjustified hike has badly hampered the overall developmental activities both in private and public sectors,” the leaders stated.The party leaders demanded that the regulatory commission, if constituted, should also be mandated to review the ban on process of extraction of building material in order to ensure maximum participation of local contractors and labourers that can eventually bring down the costs of building material.The party has also demanded financial package for businessmen and hoteliers of Jammu’s Old City areas and Katra. Senior leader Vikram Malhotra and former minister Manjit Singh said the business community and hoteliers have suffered financially due to the lockdown and have not recovered from the losses as the restrictions continue on religious tourism.They also appealed to the government to waive off electricity bills of people in Jammu and Kashmir due to the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/set-up-regulatory-commission-for-price-control-in-construction-sector-j-k-apni-party/story-r9cD7nxKW3YzKhIdNrRayN.html

The subcommittee will comprise Golden Temple granthi Giani Maan Singh, SGPC general secretary Harjinder Singh Dhami, executive member Surjit Singh Kang, members Jagsir Singh, Gurtej Singh and Gurtej Singh Dhade and assistant secretary Simarjit Singh (coordinator).“Action will be taken on the basis of the report of the panel. Anyone found guilty in the probe will be punished,” said Longowal after presiding over a meeting of SGPC’s Dharam Parchar Committee at Teja Singh Samundari Hall here.The matter of missing 267 ‘saroops’ from publishing house of the SGPC at Gurdwara Ramsar Sahib near Golden Temple was uncovered by the Punjab Human Rights Organization (PHRO) on the basis of a statement of Kanwaljit Singh, who retired as assistant supervisor of the publishing house on May 31.Kanwaljit, who also lodged a police complaint on Sunday against the SGPC officials, claimed that 80 of 267 missing ‘saroops’ got damaged in 2016 fire and the SGPC hid this incident. On the other hand, SGPC refuted his claim stating that he was lying to save his own skin.Hailing the bravery of Sikh soldier Gurtej Singh who fought Chinese troops on LAC with his kirpan, the Dharam Parchar Committee demanded that the story of his valour should be taught to school students. Longowal said due to the pandemic, ‘dharam parchar’ activities will be carried out using technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sgpc-chief-sets-up-subcommittee-to-probe-missing-267-saroops/story-dmAhNQ14RnogdnfYXlEvuO.html
30-06-2020||TV||Actor Vikas Kumar grabs the eyeballs in Aarya||The recently released web series, starring Sushmita Sen in and as ‘Aarya’ streaming on Disney+ Hotstar, is receiving great appreciation from critics for a power- packed story. But, other than Sushmita, who has made a comeback nearly after a decade, there is one more character who has been catching attention of the viewers and critics. The character is of ACP Khan, played by Vikas Kumar. Khan plays a cop who is driving the investigation, looking for a pen drive that will expose the drug traders.Son of a doctor in Bihar Sharif, Vikas has made a mark in the television and film industry for the last 10 years. He has earlier appeared as a senior inspector Rajat in CID, as well as inspector Umesh Jagdale in Pankaj Tripathi starrer web series ‘Powder’, produced by Yash Raj Chopra.Also Read: Appreciation is bigger than awards: ‘Panchayat’ series fame ChandanIn an interview with Hindustan Times, Vikas, who portrays a gay character in Aarya, says, “I liked the way the character was written. Although, ACP Khan is gay, but the series neither sensationalize the fact nor does it portray it as a big revelation. It has just one normal scene where his partner comes to him with a tiffin and asks why he is so stressed at work. This is how we normalise things for the LGBT community. Someone’s sexuality cannot be his or her identity. Here, Khan’s identity is not ‘gay’ but a ‘cop’.The character of ACP Khan evolves beautifully throughout the series. From the first episode itself, he is portrayed as the antagonist, but by the end of the series, he turns out to be the hero.Talking about the culture of web series, he said, “OTT platforms have given an exposure and opportunities to new as well as old actors for developing their skills. India is a little late in adopting the web series culture but now, with the lockdown becoming the new normal, OTT platforms have turned out to be a boon for the entertainment seekers and producers. In western countries, Hollywood actors are not only focusing on the silver screen but also working in web series for the OTT Platforms like Netflix.”Hailing from a small town of Bihar, Vikas has taken a big leap in the TV industry. Giving advice to the aspiring actors who come from a small town to Mumbai, he said, “Every outsider has to go through the struggling phase. But I don’t consider it as ‘struggle’. Rejection and failures are a process of becoming successful. The more you fail, the more you should be dedicated to work hard and win. Aspirants should first complete their education, get a degree, or gain some job experience and then plan to come to this industry. Proper planning, patience and hard work are the keys to success,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/tv/actor-vikas-kumar-grabs-the-eyeballs-in-aarya/story-1vJz9tgWMhOQbYz4aA4YnJ.html

Locals led by Kaza Mahila Mandal had staged a protest against Markanda, who also is the local MLA, for not adhering to the quarantine norms. Markanda had termed the protest as politically motivated.In the letter, the women groups and activists stated that on June 9 people of Kaza were protesting against the entry of outsiders in the valley. “However, when they learnt that the agriculture minister was entering the valley in a cavalcade of 15 cars, the locals got agitated and protested against the minister for violating quarantine norms,” the letter stated.It said that while the Centre and state government has started to lift restrictions, the people of Spiti valley have decided to continue with the lockdown norms to prevent the spread of virus.“To continue with the strict lockdown was also necessary given the lack of basic health facilities in the valley. Also, it would have been difficult to maintain social distancing in the tribal valley where people are dependent on each other,” the women activists stated.They said that the June 9 protest was triggered after the members of Tribal Advisory Committee (TAC) started to bring in migrant labourers. The locals had gone to submit a memorandum to the administration but learnt that all the officers were at the entry gate of the valley as the minister was visiting the area.The locals urged the minister to go into quarantine. However, when he didn’t agree the people protested and turned him away. Subsequently, cases were registered by the police against 190 women of Kaza under various sections of the Indian Penal Code.“Instead of appreciating the tribal women for their proactive work to save the valley, the government is humiliating and harassing them by registering police cases,” alleged the women groups and social activists.“We want the government to withdraw all the cases filed against these women or a compliant will be filed with the Women Commission and National Commission for Scheduled Tribes,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/withdraw-cases-filed-against-women-for-preventing-entry-of-agri-minister-in-spiti-valley-activists-to-hp-govt/story-5O3WxoqcZkDxJP4SroUVbO.html

The multi-tasking staffers said that they received calls from their respective branch and department heads asking them not to attend offices from July 1 as no extension is being given to them after June.

He said one .32 bore pistol, along with seven cartridges, has been recovered from the trio identified as Sukhchain Singh of Sehra village, Patiala, Amritpal Singh of Achanak village, Mansa, and Jaspreet Singh of Borewal Sohan, Majitha. Their associate Lovepreet Singh, hailing from Kaithal, had been recently arrested by the Delhi Police, along with other KLF members, he said in a statement.The DGP said the three men, who came into contact with one other through social media, were in touch with Pakistan-based handlers who provoked them to target socio-religious leaders. “Amritpal was instrumental in connecting and motivating Sukhchain and Lovepreet. Initial investigations show that their Pakistan-based handlers also invited these men to visit Pakistan for planning the future course of action,” he said.One of the foreign handlers, based in Saudi Arabia, promised to provide them shelter once they execute their actions on ground. An FIR has been registered at Sadar police station in Samana of Patiala district under Sections 13, 16, 18, 20 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 and 25/54/59 of the Arms Act, and further investigations are in progress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-police-busts-klf-terror-module-three-arrested/story-vLsUxx6q5KVV5wjtvOh8zN.html

He said that the common man had also been adversely affected by the unprecedented hike. “Reduction in fuel prices would also help the industry get up on its feet by reducing the input costs,” said Sukhbir.ALSO WRITES TO PUNJAB CMThe SAD president also wrote a separate letter to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, requesting him to reduce the state taxes on petrol and diesel. He said that in Punjab, the state tax on petrol had gone up to 27.27% while for diesel it was up at 17.53%.Badal said the high quotient of state taxes on fuel had affected farmers the most. “Movement of migrant labour out of Punjab had led to doubling of transplantation rates of paddy. Amid the paddy sowing season and various farm operations, farmers have been hit by an unreasonable hike in state taxes on diesel,” said the former deputy CM.Trade and industry, which are trying to get back on their feet after a three-month lockdown, are also feeling the pinch of high state taxes on fuel. The common man is also reeling under the weight of the high tax on petrol, added Sukhbir, requesting CM to reduce state taxes to the maximum possible to provide substantial relief to the people.“Fuel prices in Punjab are among the highest in the country right now. The chief minister had promised before 2017 assembly elections that he would reduce fuel prices if the Congress comes to power. Unfortunately, fuel prices have increased manifold in Punjab since 2017,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/reduce-central-excise-to-bring-down-petrol-diesel-prices-sukhbir-urges-pm/story-R8WHyMejTfzUU9gjRl7ZFM.html

However, the bail petition came up for hearing in the afternoon and he was granted bail.The former Jawali legislator was booked under Sections 124A (sedition), 153a (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code.He was summoned for questioning on June 24. He was interrogated till June 26 and eventually arrested. Bharti, in a series of posts on Facebook, had made ‘offensive’ remarks against the Prime Minister and RSS after the violent face-off between India and China in Galwan valley of Ladakh. A Shimla-based lawyer Narender Guleria had lodged a complaint against Bharti with the Crime Branch on June 20.The opposition Congress had criticised Bharti’s arrest, terming it as the government’s attempt to throttle dissenting voices.This was not the first time that Bharti landed in soup for making objectionable remarks on social media. He had triggered controversies in the past owing to his volatile social media posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-s-former-cps-neeraj-bharti-gets-bail-in-sedition-case/story-PNtwBBU0SU0kJ3lXvYp2UN.html

We will be there,” says a tweet from Bihar WRD.WRD minister Sanjay Kumar Jha said, “We will also soon launch a 24*7 call centre with a toll-free number for the people. Their involvement will help the department reach out to them faster and on time.” The unpredictability of rivers like Kosi and Kamla has always been a cause of worry in north Bihar.

While addressing deputy commissioners (DCs) and superintendents of police (SPs) via a videoconference, the CM said the state government will regulate the influx of people entering Himachal to ensure orderly movement and avoid any chance of spread of Covid-19. He added that the state government has taken up the matter with the Centre.The CM said the mechanism of institutional quarantine and home quarantine will also be strengthened in the state. He asked the DCs to prepare a list of various developmental projects completed in their respective districts so that they could be inaugurated online. He also asked the officials to submit the list of projects for which foundation stones could be laid via videoconferencing so that people could benefit from these projects.The CM said since the apple season is round the corner, deputy commissioners must ensure adequate arrangements of labour and smooth transportation of the fruit to markets. “All preventive measures must be taken by the DCs for minimising losses to properties due to the monsoon,” he saidThe CM said due to the pandemic, it is not possible for him to visit district headquarters for interaction with various beneficiaries and therefore, the DCs must prepare a mechanism for him to address beneficiaries of various welfare schemes through video conferencing.Jai Ram launches online self certification facility for MSMEsThe CM also launched the online self certification facility for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) in the state on Tuesday. He said the initiative for simplification of processes under the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ will go a long way in providing relief to entrepreneurs.He said earlier the entrepreneurs had to take all required clearances from concerned departments prior to setting up of the enterprise, which generally resulted in unnecessary escalation of project cost and wastage of time. “This online certification facility will not only save the entrepreneurs from cumbersome procedures, but also facilitate in setting up the enterprise at the earliest,” he said. “With this facility, the entrepreneurs will furnish a duly filled “Declaration of Intent” to the nodal agency electronically on the portal. The nodal agency will grant ‘Acknowledgement Certificate’ in an electronic format to the entrepreneur within seven days,” he added.The CM said there will neither be any inspection of the enterprise nor any required clearance will be sought from the entrepreneur by concerned departments for three years or till the enterprise starts functioning (whichever is earlier) under certain acts.He said the state government brought an ordinance regarding self certification by MSMEs on November 6, 2019. It was passed in the winter session of the vidhan sabha and was notified on January 18, 2020. The rules were framed under the Act on June 11, 2020. He said now enterprises with investment upto Rs 50 crore on plant and machinery will fall under the MSME category. “Since about 99.5% industries in the state fall under this category, the online self certification portal facility will be helpful for entrepreneurs,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/curfew-to-continue-in-himachal-from-9pm-to-5am-cm/story-JqzdyzOGltTBiflQtapGfJ.html

Bamboo sticks are environment friendly too,” said a senior EC official, wishing not to be quoted.Sources said the proposals have been sent by BIhar’s chief electoral officer to the Election Commission for final approval. “We have sent a few proposals for safety of voters at the booths. We are working on it. The concern is that voters do not come much in contact with any physical object or polling staff,” said CEO H R Srinivasa.The state has an electorate of 7.18 crore. There are 1.06 lakh booths and an additional 33,797 auxiliary booths have been planned so that number of voters at one booth is capped at 700 to maintain social distancing.EC officials said the process had started for requisition of these material and priority was being given to gloves from Bihar State Khadi Board so that it also generates rural employment. “The khadi board has been approached for gloves.Other material would be purchased locally and DMs will be authorised to do so,” said another EC official in know of the matter.Meanwhile, political parties were split on the proposed new measures. The BJP and JD(U), constituents of the ruling NDA, said they would support any such measure by EC for ensuring safety of voters, while Opposition RJD said it would infringe on the rights of voters and defeat the purpose of elections.“If EC takes any steps for safety of voters in view of Covid, we will support. But these should be widely publicised as our larger objective is to ensure 100 % voting,” said Nikhil Anand, state spokesperson of the BJP. JD(U) state spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan said, “We are in favour of safety measures for voters.”RJD’s state spokesperson Shakti Singh Yadav said, “In the name of Covid, there is an attempt being made to manipulate the polls. We will oppose any such move. We want the EC to conduct polls as in the past. Even in South Korea, elections were held amid Covid pandemic by using ballot papers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bihar-polls-amid-covidkhadi-gloves-bamboo-sticks-to-use-evms-poll-panel-hits-some-ideas/story-8iWmzkRAhkT1fRHqXxuM1J.html

Now, with the app banned, stars that rose to fame with the help of the platform say they will explore other options. Indian cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal, who was popular on TikTok, says he wholeheartedly supports the Indian government’s decision to ban 59 Chinese apps, including TikTok: “The government has taken the right step after tensions increased on the line of actual control (LAC).”“Playing cricket for India is my passion. I do not regret the banning of TikTok. I will remain active on Twitter and Instagram. My country comes first,” he said.

In a recent video, the tiny sardar, Noorpreet Kaur, who goes by Noor, requests her supporters to follow her on Instagram. The video, which has been uploaded on the TikTok account of Sandeep Toor, who conceptualises and uploads the videos, Noor says, “TikTok is going to be banned so if you want to watch my new videos follow me on Instagram.” “We support the government’s decision, so we have now decided to be more active on Instagram,” says Toor.Sandeep’s TikTok account has 2.6 million followers, while his Instagram account only has 85,000 followers as of now.Noor’s father, Satnam Singh, said, “We stand by the government’s decision, but we request that a similar Indian platform should be introduced where children like Noor can exhibit their talent.”“After Noor became famous, many people came forward to help us construct a new house. Even the CM appreciated her,” he added. Noor had teamed up with Punjab chief minster Captain Amarinder Singh to spread the message of social distancing. The district administration has also made Noor their star campaigner for social distancing videos.‘I WILL CONTINUE TO REPRESENT MY CULTURE ON INDIAN APPS’For nursing student Shiwani Thakur, TikTok, was a way of showcasing the Himachali culture. “I deleted TikTok two-and-a-half weeks ago. Now, I use the Indian app Roposo, which is not quite up to the scratch but is a good alternative. I will continue to represent my culture and reach out to people. The banning of the app hasn’t affected me much.” Haryana’s politician Sonali Phogat, who had become famous through TikTok, did not respond despite repeated attempts.

Amidst the gloom and doom of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad battling the Covid-19 pandemic, Kale, an autorickshaw driver, shines like a bright light for his positive, “get-the-job-done” attitude.Kale does not have legs, but, he has his rickshaw and the will, and heart, to ensure the pandemic does not slow him down.“If I get a few long-distance daily customers it helps me financially, but, I can still earn on my own,” is Kale’s bottom line on his situation.Kale met with a train accident between Pune and Mumbai in 2013, as a result of which his legs were amputated.After the accident, Kale, who acknowledges the support he got at the time from his family, learnt to drive a rickshaw and since, has never looked back. He had to modify the rickshaw, and instead of leg brake, his auto uses a handbrake.Nilesh Thelar, is Kale’s friend who played a key role in helping him learn to drive the rickshaw. “Nagesh’s stubbornness helped him to learn the auto. I did not have to do much and just helped him in the initial days then he did everything on his own,” Thelar said.Kale, who lives in More wasti, Chikhali, with his wife and mother used to earn between Rs800-Rs900 per day before the lockdown. Now he earns between Rs 200-Rs 300 daily.Archana Kale, his wife, works in D-mart. “We got married in 2015, it was a love marriage. After his accident in 2013 he wanted my support and I was always there for him,” she said.Once rickshaws were allowed back on the roads in Pimpri-Chinchwad, Kale began operations immediately.In what can only be viewed as a serendipitous outcome of his physical challenge, him conquering it in Covid conditions and living a full and successful life, Kale began to inspire customers he transported.“I found customers who were downcast, were very uplifted hearing my story. Now, every afternoon, I visit different places - Wakad, Chinchwad, Pimpri and the Mumbai bypass road to pick passengers up. I just talk with them if they are interested,” says Kale.“Lockdown has disheartened many people. I thought, if I can survive the worst crisis of my life then why can’t people survive through this phase. I decided to support them,” he said. “If in life, I earn a good amount of money in future, then my dream is to open a driving school for the handicapped,” says Kale.Facing suicidal thoughts… and conquering themIn the last two months, 47 people in Pimpri and Chinchwad have died in cases attributed to suicide. Nagesh Kale wants people to face tough situations instead of quitting.Kale is no stranger to deep, dark, depressing, suicidal thoughts.“In my life I got the feeling of committing suicide thrice – first, when the accident happened; then, when I was in Sassoon hospital and my parents had to do everything; and the third time again during my last phase of treatment as I was unsure about my future,” Kale said.“With the help and support of my family and friends I did not give in and today, I live happily. No matter the problem, a person can survive. My life is an example,” is Kale’s view.How Nagesh Kale changed my lifeKale has made new friends from customers he has ferried, and had the chance to share his story with.Rinkesh Pardeshi, Chinchwad resident“I was fired from my IT company in Aundh during lockdown and I could not go back to Lucknow. Since I was feeling depressed my friends suggested I take the help of a psychiatrist in Chinchwad, where I stay. I met this auto driver (Kale) whose story is really inspirational. Now, I look to interact with him thrice a week.”Arpit Joshi, Wakad resident“I got divorced before lockdown started. My parents stay in Mumbai and my lawyer told me to consult a psychiatrist, which is going well. I then met this rickshaw driver a few days back and he is so enthusiastic even in such a situation. He inspired me to develop strong will power like him.”Cases of death by suicide in PCMC in April-MayPolice station SuicidesSangvi 4Wakad 12Hinjewadi 4Pimpri 2Chinchwad 5Nigdi 4Bhosari 8MIDC, Bhosari 2Chikhali 2Dighi 3Total 46||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/extraordinary-will-to-fight-makes-auto-driver-inspiration-to-many-in-covid-times/story-LVAZS9YfXQroFXrGDQgruO.html

30-06-2020||Chandigarh||Diesel price hike eating into PRTC revenue||The constant hike in diesel prices for the past 23 days has eaten into the revenue of cash-strapped Pepsu Road Transport Corporation (PRTC).Despite getting rebate of Rs ₹1.98 per litre than the market price from the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the PRTC is presently spending Rs 9-10 per litre extra on purchase of diesel to run its buses.The diesel price recorded an estimated increase of Rs 11.14 per litre in past 23 days, including fresh increase of 13 paisa per litre on Monday.The PRTC’s daily consumption of diesel was estimated at 85,000 litres before lockdown at the time when it was running a full fleet of 1,045 buses.The state transport utility is already facing revenue loss due to limited bus service and low occupancy due to coronavirus-induced lockdown. The corporation faced a loss of Rs 51 crore in the first 60 days of the lockdown, with average daily shortfall Rs 85 lakh.PRTC managing director Jaskiran Singh said the constant hike in diesel prices has put financial burden on the PRTC, which is presently running 30% (310 buses) of its total fleet of 1,045 buses.“We are studying the clauses in a deal with the IOC over rebate on diesel. Being the bulk purchaser of the diesel, we will approach IOC and seek more discount on purchase of the fuel,” the MD said.In January, the PRTC struck a deal with the IOC for five years (till November 30, 2024), for a rebate of ₹1.98 per litre over procurement of diesel in bulk.“It is difficult for PRTC to bear the cost of diesel at the time when there is low occupancy of passengers on several routes across the state. The corporation is spending Rs 10 per litre additional on purchase of diesel,” the MD said.He added that the decision on running a full fleet will be taken after taking note of expenses on diesel and seat occupancy on key routes across the state.In 2019, the Indian Oil and PRTC had struck a similar deal related to rebate on diesel prices for five years (till 2023), but due to fluctuation in prices of diesel in the past one year, the deal was disbanded.One of the senior officials said “In such a scenario, it is financially unviable for PRTC to ply buses. The immediate increase in bus fare and decrease in diesel prices can save PRTC finances.”“After relaxation in transport restrictions since March 18, the PRTC daily income has dropped from Rs 1.40 crore to Rs 30 lakh,” an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/diesel-price-hike-eating-into-prtc-revenue/story-XOgjNjQgzQ4w311lm3WFXJ.html

The government has agreed to include private doctors and paramedical staff involved in treatment of coronavirus patients under insurance coverage. “We have held discussions, they (private medical colleges) have responded positively, they have assured that they will give more than 50 per cent of beds and provide necessary facility. They have agreed to give about 4,500 beds,” Yediyurappa said. Speaking to reporters after meeting with representatives of private medical colleges, he said this would help us in providing treatment to all those infected by Covid-19 and help them recover. “They (medical colleges) have said that they will try to make arrangements for more beds in the days to come,” he added. Private hospitals in the city on Monday after meeting with the Chief Minister had agreed to provide 50 per cent of their beds, which is about 2,000 beds to the government for Covid-19 treatment. Yediyurapa said, insurance and other facilities would be extended to private doctors and para medical staff also. “We have agreed to give compensation to private doctors and paramedical staff in case of death,” he said adding that steps would be taken to provide medical support through tele- medicine by using video conferencing mode. Medical Education Minister K Sudhakar said, Bengaluru has the most number of medical colleges in the country- total 14- 11 of them are private and three are government. From three government hospitals 1,000 beds have been kept aside for Covid, he said, private colleges have total about 10,000 beds from these eleven colleges, and in today’s meeting managements of these colleges have agreed to make 50 per cent- about 4,500 beds including ICU available for Covid treatment. They have also agreed to make available ventilators, experts, doctors, para medical staff in fight against Covid, he added. Noting that all 4,500 beds may not be available immediately as non Covid patients may be undergoing treatment there, Sudhakar said, within 10-15 days they have agreed to ensure that all the beds are made available. The central allotment committee that we have constituted in coordination with nodal officers appointed for each medical college will allot beds in a scientific manner, he said. The rates fixed for private hospitals will be applicable for private medical colleges also. Pointing out that stipend has been increased upto 45 per cent for government medical college students during Covid period, Sudhakar said private medical colleges would also have to give stipend, the department would ensure that or else action would be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/private-medical-colleges-in-bengaluru-to-allot-50-beds-for-covid-19-treatment/story-EiylvghzBu1X4OO7JyzOGN.html

The mosque was closed on June 11 in view of the “critical” conditions in the city due to a surge in Covid-19 cases, till June 30. Earlier, the mosque had reopened on June 8 after a gap of over two months with the government allowing further relaxations as part of unlock 1.0, the first phase of a calibrated exit from the coronavirus lockdown. Bukhari said that the decision to reopen the mosque was taken after consulting people and experts. “Under unlock 1.0, almost everything has opened and normal activities have resumed. We took this decision to open the mosque for people to offer namaz as the scare of the virus has lessened and awareness about safeguards against it has increased,” Bukhari told PTI.  He said that safety precautions like maintaining social distancing, wearing protective gear and sanitisation will be followed to prevent people from catching infection.  A private secretary of the Shahi Imam, Amanullah had died due to coronavirus earlier this month During the closure, people were asked to offer namaz at home, and only a few staff members offered the prayers five times a day at the mosque.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-jama-masjid-to-reopen-on-july-4-shahi-imam/story-QQ80LrIOm0WT2QA3Eu8e5I.html

The region’s local women have stepped up to aid farmers reeling under acute labour shortage in the region. The transplantation of paddy is in full-swing in the state. Paddy cultivation has not suffered in the absence of migrant labourers as local women have come out in support of farmers. Leelawati, the group leader of women labourers in Darar village of Karnal district, said, “On the request of farmers, I formed a team of 15 women and started transplantation. Farmers were ready to pay more as they were in desperate need of help but we decided not to exploit their helplessness and only charge Rs 3,000 per acre.” LOCAL LANDLESS LABOUR RISE TO THE OCCASIONNow, most farmers in paddy sowing areas of the state in Karnal, Kaithal, Kurukshetra and Yamunanagar are relying on the local landless labourers, especially women, to transplant paddy. With farmers running from pillar to post in these unprecedented circumstances, women labourers offered to help out the farmers and agreed to work for lower wages than migrant workers.Som Prakash, a small farmer from Dhanokheri village of Karnal district, said, “The locals are charging Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,500 per acre, which is lower than the migrant workers’ asking price of Rs 3,500 to Rs 4,500.” He adding that local women were performing the task thoroughly as opposed to migrant labourers who would try to hurry in order to earn more money. SOCIAL TIES REINFORCED The labour crisis has, on the upside, improved the social ties between farmers and the local landless labourers. The farmers had hitherto been dependent on the skilled migrant workers but after the lockdown they re-approached the locals.“The migrants are charging around Rs 4,000 but we have to respect our social ties and our relationship with the farmers. We cannot let our social ties deteriorate as they always help us whenever required,” says a labourer, Sarwan Kumar of Chamrori village in Yamunanagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/paddy-cultivation-haryana-s-local-women-take-up-the-baton-amid-labour-crisis/story-guH6YY6smlGQfh9bWLNFXP.html
30-06-2020||Chandigarh||Akal Takht jathedar asks SGPC to pursue cases of Khalistani operatives held by Punjab Police||Three weeks after speaking in favour of a separate Sikh state of Khalistan, Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh on Tuesday asked the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) to pursue the cases of Khalistani operatives arrested by Punjab Police recently.Addressing the media along with Takht Keshgarh Sahib jathedar Giani Raghbir Singh after a function to celebrate Miri-Piri Diwas, he said: “The arrest of innocent youngsters in the name of Khalistan is condemnable.”“It has come to our notice that Punjab Police have arrested few youngsters in the name of Khalistan. If any innocent person is arrested or anyone is put behind bars with false charges, this is condemnable and the SGPC should pursue and get the cases probed,” said Giani Harpreet Singh. Earlier this month, he claimed that every Sikh wanted Khalistan. “If the government offers it, we will accept it,” he said.Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh dismissed that statement of the Akal Takht jathedar, telling the media, “Sikhs in the country are leading prosperous lives. Why would they want a Khalistan? Nobody wants it and I don’t want. Every Sikh has always stood for the unity and integrity of the country. Do you know how many Sikh soldiers we have? They sacrifice their lives for the country. We fight for our country and this is our country.”Giani Harpreet Singh clarified in Talwandi Sabo later, “Sikhism can’t be defined by the idea of Khalistan alone. Sikhism is the global idea and this idea should bring peace to the world.”Taking serious note of the missing 267 Guru Granth Sahib saroops in the SGPC’s publishing house at Gurdwara Ramsar Sahib near Golden Temple, he said, “The SGPC has been asked to conduct a probe and submit its report soon. Stringent action will be taken against the guilty.”Considering the complaints received by the Akal Takht about the appointment of ‘patit’ members in the Chief Khalsa Diwan, the jathedar warned those at its helm of action if they continue to take Sikhs who have violated the religious code of conduct in the 117-year-old organisation, an apolitical body that concerns itself with religious, educational and cultural issues.“The Chief Khalsa Diwan office-bearers have been asked to give details of the new members. Till they do this, they won’t be allowed to induct more members,” the jathedar said.Earlier, while addressing devotees at the function at the highest temporal seat of the Sikhs, Giani Harpreet Singh shared the history of Miri Piri Diwas, celebrated to commemorate the blessings of the sixth Sikh master, Guru Hargobind Sahib, who took charge wearing two kirpans called Miri and Piri, symbolising worldly (political) and spiritual authority. The two kirpans are tied together with a khanda at the centre, so the combination of both is considered supreme, Where action informed or arising out of the spiritual heart completes one’s purpose and meaning in the world of action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/akal-takht-jathedar-asks-sgpc-to-pursue-cases-of-khalistani-operatives-held-by-punjab-police/story-gUgVQgBPohb2q4cYVjbn7N.html

Four drones given by the central government are being used to spray insecticides,” SN Singh, the assistant director of the agriculture department said, according to news agency ANI.An alert for Kanpur has also been issued by the district administration as the insects were seen flying around surrounding areas of the district.“According to the wind speed, the locusts can enter Kanpur. In view of this, an alert is being issued that all the people should follow the instructions of the government authorities and administration to save themselves from locust attack,” Brahmadev Tiwari, Kanpur’s district magistrate, said.Officials said the police, health and agriculture departments and the fire brigade are on alert as they keep an eye on the insects’ movement.In Lucknow district as well, the administration is on alert as the threat of locust invasion looms. Lucknow’s agriculture department has deployed more than 20 tractor-mounted pesticide guns in border area like Malihabad to kill the desert locusts.CP Srivastava, deputy director of the agriculture department, said more than 7,000 locals have been roped in these areas to scare away the locusts with the help of drums and other noise-making tools.The desert locust is a species of locusts, a swarming short-horned grasshopper. They fly in swarms potentially containing hundreds of millions of individual desert locusts and can move 150 kilometres a day.The invasion of these tiny insects can pose a serious threat to livelihoods of millions and cause a shortage of food supply in their relentless drive to eat and reproduce. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations, these are the oldest migratory pest in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/60-of-locusts-have-been-killed-in-agra-agriculture-department/story-9oXuiD5tBsVXCG1USJ1tuK.html

Additional chief secretary (health) RD Dhiman issued an order to this effect late on Monday, exercising powers vested under Clause 3 of the Himachal Pradesh Epidemic Disease (Covid-19) Regulations, 2020.“It has been observed that the number of Covid-19 patients and those requiring treatment has been increasing and from trends as well as the situation emerging throughout the country and across the globe it is apprehended that the graph is likely to peak in the coming months,” reads the order.It is, therefore, expected that health institutions will be under more stress and under a heavier work load.

30-06-2020||Delhi||How ASI geared up to combat locust attack in Delhi||Ahead of the locust attack in Delhi this weekend, the Archaeological Survey of India(ASI) issued elaborate guidelines to prevent any damage to trees, gardens and shrubs that fall under its jurisdiction. There are 174 protected monuments under the ASI in Delhi. Swarms have recently caused panic in the country as they extensively feed on plants and are capable of destroying large areas of vegetation, including crops. The threat has been particularly dire in Rajasthan; however, over the weekend Delhi issued an advisory to prepare for a possible attack. ASI swung into action after swarms were spotted in Gurgaon. “After the first notification was issued, Delhi did not see a swarm,” said a culture ministry official. “However, after the Delhi government issued an advisory on Saturday an emergency meeting was held with the DG ASI.” At the meeting, all division heads were directed to spray the required dose of two insecticides – melathion and cholopyriphos – to avoid any damage to protected properties. The ASI, in an office memorandum issued by the Department of Horticulture, had asked all division heads to “make necessary arrangements for spraying of pesticides to prevent damage caused due to the swarms of locusts…” HT has seen the office memorandum. “Both are old insecticides but they work really well,” said Aruna Urs, a farmer at Takshashila Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/how-asi-geared-up-to-combat-locust-attack-in-delhi/story-y9akt0ICAV40iXQVGdM2nM.html

The Class 1 student has, through his artwork, has raised ₹54,000, which he donated to Shrimad Rajchandra Love and Care (SRLC), a non-governmental organisation (NGO). The organisation has been raising money to provide supplies and equipment to Covid-19 hospitals, support frontline workers and distribute monthly ration to daily wage workers.Throughout May, Kavir’s mother Urvashi used to make theplas to distribute among the poor as well as the stranded migrants. One of the days, while helping his mother roll the theplas, Kavir realised that he wanted to do more to help those in need.Kavir had been painting in his free time since the lockdown was imposed in March and Urvashi suggested that they could try raising money from his artwork to donate for Covid-19 relief work. Kavir was enthusiastic about the idea and started experimenting further with his set of colours, canvas and art papers. “Initially, I was hesitant because I was unsure about who would want to buy a child’s paintings. But when we circulated the catalogue with all his paintings, requests soon began to pour in from our friends and relatives staying in Chennai, Bengaluru and even in the United States. Until now, he has sold 24 paintings, with each of them costing around ₹1,500 to ₹3,000,” said Urvashi. Some of his artwork include the dot art, the spider’s colourful web, the Atlantic Ocean and the deep blue sea. The young artist now aims to raise around ₹70,000 by July. “He continues to make more paintings everyday,” said Urvashi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/6-year-old-mumbai-boy-raises-54k-through-artwork-donates-it-to-ngos/story-5n05uMNQpBA6xd6aMv3HgL.html

This decision was taken by the new civic commissioner, Dr Mantada Raja Dayanidhi. The patients will be shifted when the alternate facility is ready, later this week. The ESIS Hospital was constructed in 1975 and has a capacity of 100 beds.After taking charge, Dayanidhi was surveying the Covid hospitals in the city when he came across the condition of the ESIS Hospital. “Currently around 50 Covid positive asymptomatic patients are admitted in ESIS Hospital. Instructions have been provided by the commissioner to shift these patients, as it would be dangerous to continue to house them in a dilapidated structure, especially during monsoons. Within a few days, a temporary arrangement will be made available at the New Tehsildar Office for these patients to be shifted,” said Dr Yuvraj Bhadane, public relations officer, Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation. Meanwhile, the Ulhasnagar Traders Association and the Forum of Manufacture Association have together imposed a self-lockdown from July 1 to 7 within the city. “Taking into consideration the increasing number of Covid-19 positive cases, we have decided to impose self-lockdown.

30-06-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC disposes of PIL seeking cancellation of CISCE exams||The Bombay high court (HC) disposed of a public interest litigation (PIL) which sought directions to scrap board exams for Class 10 and Class 12 of the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), which were scheduled to be held in July. This comes after the Supreme Court was informed by the council that it was adopting the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) formula of making the exams optional for the students this year and would declare the results by July 15. The HC, however, gave liberty to the petitioner to approach the court in case they were not satisfied with the assessment methodology which the council would adopt while declaring result.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice SS Shinde, while hearing the PIL filed by a parent and advocate Arvind Tiwari and others through video conferencing on Monday, was informed by the council that it had not prepared the methodology which was sought by the court in the earlier hearing.The council, however, informed the bench that as it had already submitted to the apex court that the results would be declared by July 15 and students would be given the option of appearing for the exams thereafter, the prayers of the petitioners were addressed. The council also submitted that as the SC while hearing the petition had said that all other litigations regarding CISCE and CBSE exams were deemed to be disposed of, hence these PIL should be disposed of.The petitioners, however, informed the court that as the council had not clarified the methodology of assessment it would adopt while declaring results, the petition should be kept pending till the CISCE furnished the same to the court.After hearing the argument, the bench upheld the contention of the council and said as the SC had ordered disposal of all PILs on the matter, the PILs stood disposed. It, however, granted liberty to the petitioners to file a fresh PIL if there were any grievances regarding the methodology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-disposes-of-pil-seeking-cancellation-of-cisce-exams/story-AQ6VTE1FLiEPPSDJfaLyGJ.html
30-06-2020||Mumbai||Ban on travel beyond 2km was necessary, says Maharashtra CM||Although the Mumbai Police’s new order, prohibiting citizens from venturing beyond the 2-km radius of their homes, led to confusion and anger among many, the state on Monday said it was a necessary step. On Sunday, the police’s guidelines stated citizens can travel beyond 2km only if they have to go to work or in case of any emergency. The police also warned of action against those violating the rule.Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray said the motive behind the rule was to keep uncontrolled and unnecessary crowding on roads in check.“People in Mumbai and MMR [Mumbai Metropolitan Region] are seen venturing out of their homes without any reason, leading to crowding and traffic jams. This is not expected [of the citizens] when the Covid-19 outbreak is at its peak and [such acts] will hamper the efforts that have helped us in keeping the spread of virus under control in the state. Newer challenges will be posed before us in such a scenario and [thus] the steps taken by the Mumbai Police are necessary in larger interest,” Thackeray said.According to state government officials, there were no specific directives given to the Mumbai Police to impose these restrictions. “The steps were taken using the powers given to them through the notifications issued from time to time. It is true that the diktat created a lot of confusion and led to chaos, but it was necessary. Had they created necessary awareness among citizens, the confusion could have been avoided,” said a state government official.Meanwhile on Monday, despite the police’s action against motorists a day earlier, many vehicles continued to ply on roads, leading to traffic snarls in several areas. The Mumbai Police conducted nakabandi at 137 places across the city and checked 30,072 vehicles , leading to further traffic woes. The western and eastern express highways, the arterial roads leading to Mumbai from Vashi, and other main roads in the suburbs witnessed traffic jams till afternoon. “We are checking vehicles across the city and impounding those that have been taken out without any valid reason or documents,” said Madhukar Pandey, joint commissioner of police (traffic).In the past 24 hours, Mumbai Police along with the traffic department have impounded 14,691 vehicles. Senior inspector Mahendra Nerlekar of Jogeshwari police station said, “People are roaming unnecessarily. Some said they thought the lockdown is over. When we stop them, they say that they are going to office or to a hospital to meet their kin, but fail to show us the papers, owing to which we are forced to act against them,” Nerlekar said.

30-06-2020||City||St George and Sir JJ Hospitals to get new ventilators in 15 days, says Mumbai guardian minister||A month after 81 ventilators donated to St George Hospital and Sir JJ Hospital were found to be of substandard quality, city’s guardian minister Aslam Shaikh said the two hospitals will get new, upgraded ventilators in 15 days.Shaikh said the existing ventilators will be taken back by the company which manufactured them. “The machines have not been up to the mark and will now be replaced with upgraded ones. I am not sure if the two hospitals will get the same number of ventilators [St George Hospital had received 39 ventilators, while Sir JJ Hospital received 42], but that will be worked out soon. The upgraded versions will arrive in the next 15 days.”A short while after the ventilators were donated, the two hospitals realised that the patients put on the machines did not show any signs of improvement. Following this, Sir JJ Hospital wrote to Dr TP Lahane, the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). “The machine is not able to give 100 percent FiO2 and when patients were put on other ventilator, they showed immediate signs of improvement in O2 saturation, respiratory rate and patient compliance. We are of the opinion that these ventilators cannot cater to the critical care of Covid patients,” stated Sir JJ Hospital’s letter, a copy of which is with HT.While Dr Lahane was unavailable for comment, Sir JJ Hospital’s dean, Dr Ranjit Mankeshkar, said, “We had never asked for the ventilators. One of the NGOs had donated them. We have been sending them back as they are lying unused. Also, we are not in a dire need of ventilators, as we have 98 currently, which are sufficient for now.”As per BMC’s data released on Sunday, 32 of 775 the ventilators in the civic facilities are currently not in use. A senior health official said, “We are not facing a shortage of these equipment at our facilities. There are ventilators that are vacant and the total capacity will keep on increasing.”Almost 5% of Covid-19 patients need to be put on a ventilator when they fail to inhale oxygen on their own. Then the patient is incubated and artificially, oxygen is pumped into the lungs. “Oxygen is supplied based on the level of oxygen saturation of a patient. As many patients develop bilateral pneumonia, they fail to breathe on their own. If the oxygen supply and the pressure are inadequate, the patient can die within a few hours of admission,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, in-charge of Sion Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/st-george-and-sir-jj-hospitals-to-get-new-ventilators-in-15-days-says-mumbai-guardian-minister/story-1nFPDxCNiKBi18j9VSUbaK.html

Till Saturday, we had tested over 41,000 people in the city. We will now have to increase the testing capacity for which the kits will be required. The kit gives results in 30 minutes and can be used for mass screening.”He said that if a person tests positive, he will not be retested, however, in case of a negative result, the test will be re-conducted in a week.“The tests are not completely accurate, however, they will help screen the patients. We will use them in areas which have a high density of positive cases. People will be screened using the kits, so we can identify and quarantine those who are positive at the earliest. Even if the person in red zone does not show symptoms, he will be tested,” Kendre said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-civic-corporation-to-get-1-lakh-rapid-testing-kits/story-nkjVPFrluQXSQviLv3RPmN.html

After her video went viral on social media last week, it led to controversy over Bhosale’s action. Later, she claimed she was being bullied by locals.Inspector Kishore Kharat, in-charge of Mankhurd police station, has sent a notice under section 149 (cognisable offences) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) addressed to her mother Varsha Bhosale on June 24, the day of the incident.The notice, a copy of which is with HT, stated it was inappropriate for her to visit the mosque and that she should have approached the police first with any grievance that she may have had. It also added that her going to the mosque and requesting them to lower the volume could have led to a law and order situation. The mother-daughter duo has been asked to abide by the rules, failing which they could be booked for going against the notice and face charges under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/woman-gets-notice-for-asking-mosque-to-lower-volume/story-ij7TsBytEUfk5WMLr4mrJN.html
30-06-2020||Mumbai||Centre’s Smart Cities Mission a mere announcement: Sena||The Shiv Sena on Monday took a jibe at the Centre over its Smart Cities Mission and said if smart cities like Mumbai and Pune are created in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar the population density of the cities in Maharashtra would come down. An editorial in the party’s mouthpiece Saamana said the Narendra Modi-led Central government’s Smart Cities Mission has merely remained an “announcement” after it was launched in 2015. Referring to Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s statement last month that there was a need to decongest Mumbai, the editorial said that Sena founder Bal Thackeray had cautioned about the rising population in Mumbai and Pune first. It said the Sena patriarch had sought ‘permit’ system in Mumbai, which had kicked up a storm in the Lok Sabha during prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s government, and added that Bal Thackeray withdrew the demand on the request of BJP leaders to save the Vajpayee government.“Because of Gadkari, this issue has come to the fore now… Gadkari is of the opinion that smart cities and smart villages like Mumbai should be created in other places. The suggestion is good, but the Modi government has already made an announcement to make 100 smart cities. From those 100, how many have materialised? Smart Cities Mission was announced on June 25, 2015; today in 2020, only 15% of the work has happened. The programme was good, but it only remained an announcement,” the editorial read.It further stated that around 7-8 lakh migrant labourers left Mumbai during lockdown, while 3-3.5 lakh such labourers from Pune went back to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, etc. “Now these labourers are coming back to Mumbai. Around 1.50 lakh labourers have returned. This is because there is no development in their states. If you create smart cities like Mumbai and Pune in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the population density of Mumbai and Pune will come down naturally. Jobs should be created in those states first. The Centre should focus on states like UP, Bihar Jharkhand and Delhi,” it said.The editorial added that labourers returning to Mumbai and Pune indicated that hunger prevailed over the threat of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/centre-s-smart-cities-mission-a-mere-announcement-sena/story-iP5HCaLXbMJL12iZ68oqPI.html
30-06-2020||City||No complete lockdown, but Thane sees complete chaos||Thane police commissioner Vivek Phansalkar on Monday put out a tweet on complete lockdown in Thane, only to retract from it hours later, just like the Thane Municipal Corporation, leaving residents panicking and thronging markets to stock up on essentials.The decision on a lockdown has been pending since Saturday, when the corporation first decided to impose it. The police department wanted a complete lockdown, while the civic body was indecisive. On Monday morning, both the authorities decided on a lockdown, however, the corporation again backtracked in the evening.Apart from the tweet, the announcements of lockdown were even made using autorickshaws across the city. Many even tweeted to know what will be allowed and what is restricted. The corporation’s earlier stance that home delivery of vegetables or groceries will not permitted only added to the confusion.Thane police commissioner claimed the tweet was removed and the lockdown will only be limited to containment and red zones. Vivek Phansalkar, police commissioner, Thane, said, “There will not be a complete lockdown in the city, but only in containment zones and red zones. Many people from Thane commute to Mumbai and nearby cities, so a complete lockdown is not possible. Instead, we will ensure that the lockdown restrictions are implemented strictly in containment zones and areas where the density of cases is more.”Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, said, “We are still working on the norms of a lockdown. The notification of things permitted in the areas under lockdown will be in accordance with the state guidelines. Residents should not panic.” He, however, offered no clarity on complete lockdown.The flip-flop invited the ire of the residents. Harshada Sandhan, 37, a resident of Hiranandani Estate, said, “With no clarity on whether essential goods and grocery would be available, we went into last-minute panic to stock up on essentials, as in March, when complete lockdown was announced, it continued till May-end. With no information, we scrambled to stock up on perishables such as dairy and vegetables.”Many said the rush only made sure social distancing norms were flouted. Sagar Patil, 34, a resident of Dokali, said, “We heard the announcement and went to the market in my area. There was a huge crowd with no social distancing. There were queues outside wine shops too.”With 338 new cases on Monday, Thane’s case count is 8,506, while the toll is 292 with 15 new deaths. Meanwhile, the Ambernath Municipal Council (AMC) has extended its weeklong lockdown to another week till July 6. Earlier on June 23 the municipal council imposed a week-long lockdown due to the spike in Covid- 19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-complete-lockdown-but-thane-sees-complete-chaos/story-sE3Ku8cPYwGHoxMAarwq6J.html
30-06-2020||Mumbai||Hire locals for work on Metro, other infra projects: Thackeray||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday directed the authorities to employ locals for the construction of Metro and other infrastructure projects that are stuck due to a shortage of labourers. Owing to the complete lockdown between March and May, several migrant labourers working on key infrastructure projects in Mumbai and surrounding areas went back to their home states.Thackeray held a meeting with Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) commissioner RA Rajeev, chief secretary Ajoy Mehta, and other senior officials about the projects stuck due to lack of manpower. “Local people should be given employment immediately where Metro and other infrastructure projects are stuck due to lack of labourers,” a statement from the chief minister’s office (CMO) said quoting Thackeray.However, officials said it may not be easy to replace migrant labourers with locals, as they need certain skill set and training for these jobs.In Mumbai, construction of six Metro lines, including an underground corridor, is underway. Of the six projects, MMRDA is working on five corridors. Senior MMRDA officials said the work on Metro lines has not been halted, but is proceeding at 30% efficiency. Officials said around 1,000 labourers have re-joined work this month, and they expect another 1,200 to come in July to start work on Dahisar east-Andheri east (Metro 7), Wadala-Ghatkopar-Thane-Kasarvadavli (Metro 4), and Kasarvadavli-Gaimukh (Metro 4A) lines. “Since excavation and other works on ground are halted during monsoon, the requirement [of labourers] is relatively less, but right now the availability is scarce. If labourers do not return by July, we will have to hire more [labourers] through contractors. The contractors are saying more labourers will come in July, but we are not sure considering the rise of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai and its surrounding areas,” an official said, requesting anonymity.Another official said, “As per the directives of the CM, we will inform the contractors to hire locals immediately. But the issue is we cannot replace labourers with other labourers. There are certain skill sets and training required to handle these jobs.”Thackeray also asked MMRDA and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to coordinate well during monsoon. He directed MMRDA to clear debris at construction sites and regularly drain pits so that there is no spread of diseases or any untoward incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hire-locals-for-work-on-metro-other-infra-projects-thackeray/story-8YBS1MX7b6qA5633O7HwnJ.html
30-06-2020||Mumbai||Inflated bills: Don’t cut power supply, allow EMI, says MERC||The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) on Monday issued directives for utility firms, including providing the option of easy monthly instalments (EMI) and not disconnecting power supply over non-payment of dues until grievances are redressed. According to MERC, only 6.35 lakh consumers across state were billed on actual meter readings during the lockdown, which is approximately 2.32% of the total consumer base.Following reports of inflated bills, MERC held a meeting with heads of all the four distribution licensees on June 27. In a statement released on Monday, MERC said that if one’s bill is more than double of the average for the amount charged during March to May, consumers should be given the option of dividing the payment into three EMIs. It has also asked utility firms to “set-up a robust monitoring mechanism”, like a dedicated help-desk or a grievance officer at all sub/divisions and divisional offices to address queries from consumers within a day of their receipt. Power supply cannot be disconnected until consumers have been given the option of EMIs and their grievances redressed, MERC stated.Consumers should also be provided with online software for them to self-check bills and meter readings must be rechecked on a suo motu basis if excessive consumption is noticed, said MERC. If they are not satisfied with their utility provider’s response, consumers have the option of reaching out to the electricity ombudsman. “The commission is keeping vigil on the billing issues and would not like any consumer to be put to any undue inconvenience by the distribution licensees,” MERC stated.Owing to the lockdown, actual meter reading was disconnected in March-end, following which consumers were billed on average consumption based on three months prior to March 2020, which were winter months. “The present bills raised on actual meter readings are of summer months where the consumption is normally high and the bills are always of higher amounts,” MERC said. However, thousands of consumers have complained they’ve been charged two to three times their normal usage.A senior member of the regulatory body said, “The utilities have also been directed to shift to automated meter reading in a year’s time, which will help accurate meter readings without human intervention and billing grievances will be reduced to a large extent.”According to MERC, only 6,35,746 consumers across Maharashtra were billed on actual meter reading during the lockdown period (see box), which is merely 2.32% of the total consumers. However, MERC has already approved installation of 7 lakh meters for Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML) and 66,000 meters for Tata Power, it stated.After Pannu, other celebs complain Following actor Taapsee Pannu who took to Twitter on Sunday to complain about a high electricity bill, more celebrities like actor Huma S Qureshi, producer Tanujj Garg and RJ Malishka tweeted about the issue on Monday. Former news anchor Faye D’Souza also complained about getting an inflated bill. Qureshi said that she received a bill of ₹50,000 when she had paid ₹6,000 last month.Consumers billed on meter-readingMaharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited: 6,11,537 of total 2.30 crore consumers in the state Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited: 570 of 27 lakh consumers in MumbaiTata Power: 23,446 of over 7 lakh consumers in MumbaiBrihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking: 193 of 10.5 lakh consumers in the island city||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/inflated-bills-don-t-cut-power-supply-allow-emi-says-merc/story-IoM5Pgig9l5smFaYwnGBtL.html

It is mandatory by law for educational institutions to keep 5% of its total seats under the PwD quota. However, CPS has said it does not come under purview of this rule. Dr Swapnil Jadhav cleared MBBS under the PwD quota in 2014 and wants to pursue a diploma in radiology and electrology. However, having approached CPS several times over the past six weeks, Dr Jadhav has learnt it doesn’t have a PwD quota. “This despite a Supreme Court order which makes PwD quota mandatory in all government institutions offering higher education,” he said.Recently, Dr Jadhav approached the National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP). Last week, NCPEDP sent a letter to CPS, recommending Dr Jadhav be admitted under the PwD quota as per section 32 of the Rights of Persons with Disability (RPwD) Act (2016), which provides for mandatory reservation of seats for PwD candidates in all higher education institutes. “The College of Physicians and Surgeons falls within the mandate of section 32 of the RPwD Act. Despite being a distinguished academic institution, it has neglected to fulfil its statutory obligations and the admission brochure for 2019-20 does not show any reservation being provided to PwD candidates,” states the letter dated June 19. NCPEDP further requests CPS to take urgent steps to comply with the RPwD Act.However, CPS has said the law is not applicable to it since CPS is a non-aided institute. “Only those institutes that follow admissions based on National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) scores or through the state common entrance test (CET) cell follow quota rules. Since we are non-aided, these quotas don’t apply to us,” said Dr Girish Maindarkar, president, CPS. He said the institute is yet to decide on how and when to implement NCPEDP’s recommendation. “We have a meeting scheduled for July 3 where we will discuss and decide how to act on the recommendations. For now, students interested in applying to our institute need to wait for the prospectus that will soon be released,” Maindarkar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pwd-quota-doesn-t-exist-at-parel-medical-institute-says-pg-aspirant/story-kIbeMKGaDGATpDPCIve5nI.html
30-06-2020||Mumbai||IMD’s yellow alert: MMR is likely to get heavy rain on Tuesday||The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) witnessed an increase in rain intensity from Monday night which may continue throughout Tuesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday. The weather bureau has predicted heavy rain and thundershowers across isolated areas in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) for Tuesday.A yellow alert (be updated for heavy rain) has been issued for MMR and remaining areas of the Konkan coast. Mumbai may witness thunderstorms accompanied by lightning, gusty winds and heavy rain at isolated areas, while Thane and Palghar may experience thunderstorms with lightning. While no warnings were issued for Wednesday and Thursday, heavy rain at isolated places has been predicted for Friday (July 3). Meanwhile, a red alert (very heavy rain warning) has been issued for Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg from July 3 onwards.As predicted by IMD, parts of south and central Mumbai received intense thundershowers late evening on Monday with an average of over 40 mm rain, which falls under the ‘rather heavy’ category between 9.30pm and 10.30pm. According to location-wise rain figures (from automatic weather stations of IMD), within a span of an hour, the maximum rain was recorded at Dadar at 70.1 mm followed by Parel at 63 mm, Prabhadevi, 61 mm, Worli 58.4 mm, Sewri 51 mm, Byculla 41 mm, Dharavi 24 mm, Bandra 17 mm.“Cloud bands moved from northern suburbs over the city and further towards the coast, allowing intense localised thundershowers in isolated areas in northern and western suburbs followed by heavy rain in south-central Mumbai,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD. “Monsoon systems do have embedded mesoscale systems (microclimate characteristics), which give intense rainfall at highly localised places,” he added.Earlier between 8.30am on Sunday and 8.30am on Monday, the Santacruz weather station, representative of the suburbs, recorded 39.4 mm rain which falls under the ‘rather heavy rain’ category, while 33.6 mm rain (moderate) was recorded at Colaba, representative of south Mumbai. IMD classifies 7.6 mm-35.5 mm rain as moderate and 35.6 mm-64.4 mm as rather heavy rain.Between 5.30pm and 8.30pm on Monday, light to moderate rain was recorded across several areas in northwestern suburbs including 27 mm rain in Dindoshi, 18 mm Goregaon, 14 mm Borivli, 12 mm Kandivli, and 19 mm in Kalyan-Dombivli. Santacruz weather station recorded traces of rain while no rain was recorded in south Mumbai. “A cyclonic circulation over west central Arabian Sea combined with a feeble offshore trough from Karnataka to Kerala coast is allowing moisture incursions and westerly wind pattern over the Konkan coast, allowing marginal increase in rain activity. This is likely to enhance monsoon currents through the week,” said an official from IMD.Meanwhile, with rather heavy rain over the past 24 hours, Mumbai has so far recorded 383.8 mm rain against the monthly average of 493.1 mm, which continues to be the lowest June rainfall in five years.On Monday, the day temperature in the city and suburbs was 1.1 degree Celsius above normal while the night temperature was close to the normal mark. South Mumbai recorded 92% humidity while 85% was recorded in the suburbs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/imd-s-yellow-alert-mmr-is-likely-to-get-heavy-rain-on-tuesday/story-U8nl2fKpgkNuEhriNtrmdK.html
30-06-2020||Mumbai||After state dept’s rap, housing societies allow house helps, drivers||Many housing societies have now decided to allow the entry of house helps and drivers from July 1, following the state cooperation department’s circular to the registrars to take action against those societies who disallow them.The housing societies, which were resisting the entry initially, said they have taken this decision under duress. “We were stern about not allowing house helps to protect our residents. However, the government’s order and ruckus created by a section of residents, forced us to relent,” said Karan Jotwani, of __Serenity Complex at Oshiwara. He said most house helps reside in the Anand Nagar slums where many Covid cases have been reported.Dhaval Shah, chairman of Lokhandwala-Oshiwara Residents Association, said, “Majority of residents do not want maids. The entire society will be at risk because of a few people.”The cooperation department issued a circular last week asking the registrars to inform the housing society office bearers that they cannot deny access to the maids and drivers in their premises, as it was contrary to the directives being given by the state government.Anil Kawade, commissioner, cooperation and registrar department, said the circular has been sent to housing societies. “We have told them not to bar the entry. If we get any complaint, we will take action against the errant parties,” said Kawade.Majority of housing societies barred entry to the maids and drivers during the lockdown. Despite the ease, they were unwilling to allow them thus causing a rift among the members.Noted housing activist Advocate Vinod Sampat said that it was the double standards on the part of the housing societies. “The housing societies cannot stop the residents from going out to work. However, they deny entry to the maids and drivers. Even the residents can be carriers of the virus. People need to take precautions, but denying entry to any section is wrong,” said Sampat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-state-dept-s-rap-housing-societies-allow-house-helps-drivers/story-wG72jU4ebz2Uu9pFDR6YxJ.html
30-06-2020||City||Nilje ROB to be repaired and opened in 15 days: MSRDC||Nilje rail overbridge (ROB) on the Diva-Panvel railway route falling on Kalyan–Shilphata Road, which was declared unsafe and was shut since June 15, will be repaired and opened to vehicles after load testing, said the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) on Monday.“After a joint visit by MSRDC and Central Railway (CR) on Monday, it has been decided that the bridge will be repaired and will be set open for vehicles after conducting a test to ensure it is safe to use, in 15 days. The repair work will be undertaken by MSRDC under the supervision of railway,” said Nitin Borule, executive engineer, MSRDC.A safety audit of the 50-year-old bridge was carried out by the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) which revealed that the structure of the bridge was unsafe and should be closed immediately in a view of safety of the railway as well as road traffic.However, when the bridge was declared shut, there was no clarity on whether the bridge will be repaired or be demolished. Commuters had asked the authorities to repair the bridge and open it citing that the closure led to major congestion on the parallel bridge.CR had, in May, decided to shut the bridge and informed concerned officials of MSRDC and Thane traffic police. On June 5, the traffic police released a notification about closing the bridge and diverting the traffic on the parallel new bridge.“When the bridge was shut all the vehicles were diverted to the parallel bridge, leading to severe congestion as many office-goers use this stretch. The authorities should open the bridge without delay,” said Anand Mehta, 30, a daily commuter from Navi Mumbai. “We have informed the IIT-B about conducting repair work. Once the work is finished, IIT-B will inspect and test its safety, following which the bridge will be opened to vehicles,” said Borule. After a part of Andheri’s Gokhale bridge collapsed on July 3, 2018, both the Central and Western Railway appointed a team of experts from IIT-B to inspect 445 bridges over railway tracks in the city.The 21-km-long Kalyan-Shilphata Road which connects Kalyan-Dombivli-Bhiwandi-Thane to Navi Mumbai is a vital link and sees major traffic during peak hours. With the closure of the 9-metre-long and 15-metre-wide Nilje bridge, there was an increase in traffic congestion.“The closure of the bridge and the relaxations on lockdown has led to traffic congestion. If the bridge is repaired and opened, it will give some relief to commuters,” said a traffic police officer from Kalyan (East), who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nilje-rob-to-be-repaired-and-opened-in-15-days-msrdc/story-IE4qUewB6TMUaX3OSNUANN.html

30-06-2020||Mumbai||State approves plasma therapy for mild and moderate Covid cases||The Maharashtra government on Monday permitted the use of convalescent plasma therapy in all dedicated Covid hospitals in the state as treatment for Covid-19 in an emergency situation. The state also launched Project Platina, in which 500 critically-ill patients of Covid-19, at 21 medical colleges across Maharashtra, will be given convalescent plasma therapy as a part of clinical trial.The government resolution issued by the medical education department on Monday says plasma therapy may now be considered for patients whose oxygen requirement is progressively increasing despite use of steroids.“With approval from union health ministry, Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), the state decided using convalescent plasma therapy as treatment in mild and moderate cases. With this, plasma therapy can be used as a treatment in emergency at all government, private and charitable hospitals declared as dedicated for Covid treatment but they have to follow protocol of emergency authorisation,” said Dr Sanjay Mukherjee, secretary state medical education department.On Monday, Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray also launched Project Platina. With 500 critically-ill Covid-19 patients, the state claimed Project Platina is the world’s largest trial-cum-treatment project related to plasma therapy for Covid-19. Thackeray also inaugurated Covid-19 plasma banks at 13 of the 21 centres participating in Project Platina, for which ₹16.85 crore has been approved from the CM Relief Fund.HT had reported on June 11 that the state would implement a plasma therapy trial project.These 500 patients will be given two doses of 200 ml of convalescent plasma, which has been taken from a recovered Covid-19 patient. “The state also intends to take this further and isolate monoclonal antibodies against Covid-19 from this plasma and study its structure,” Dr Mukherjee said. The treatment during this trial will be provided free of cost to all participating patients.“Convalescent plasma therapy is coming up as one of the most important methods to treat severe Covid-19 patients in the absence of definite treatment drugs,” said Dr Mukherjee. “The trial will also help formulate definite treatment guidelines for the entire country and thus prove a milestone in the pandemic,” he added.In convalescent plasma therapy, plasma, a blood component, is transfused from the recovered patient — whose blood has antibodies to fight Covid-19 — to one still afflicted by the infection. The therapy may also be used to immunise frontline workers, families of patients and other high-risk people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-approves-plasma-therapy-for-mild-and-moderate-covid-cases/story-sOMURTVpLJxFRl2DZcuu3N.html

Meanwhile, the autonomous college run by Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal (SVKM) charitable trust has extended the deadline for payment by six days till July 6.Students had also alleged that the institute did not allow students to make payments in instalments despite instructions from the University Grants Commission (UGC) and University of Mumbai (MU).Akhil Chitre from the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has written to the management of SVKM and Mithibai College administration to waive the fee hike and to allow students to pay their fees in instalments. “If the college doesn’t pay heed to our demands, it will have to answer to the wrath of MNS,” said Chitre.Similarly, Mohammed Salman, president of the south Maharashtra wing of Student Islamic Organisation, has written to the Fee Regulating Authority to take matters into consideration.In view of the nationwide lockdown to control Covid-19 pandemic, UGC — the apex body governing all educational institutes in the country — had issued a letter on May 27 to all universities and colleges asking them to be sympathetic towards students while asking them to pay tuition and other fees. Subsequently, MU instructed all colleges, including autonomous ones, to not hike fees for the academic year 2020-21 and allow students to pay fees in instalments.Students of Mithibai College said that despite the directions, they had been given a four-day window to make payments and there was no provision for partial payment. Meanwhile, in a notice published on the website late on Sunday, Rajpal Hande, principal of Mithibai College, informed the students that the deadline to pay fees has been extended till July 6.

The meeting focused on permitting more people working for essential services, increasing the operation of train services and maintaining social distancing inside the local train compartments.The railways have asked the state to provide a detailed list of essential service employees who will be permitted to travel by train. “We have asked the government to speed up the process of issuing e-pass and also provide a list along with the number of passengers allowed to travel in local trains. Local train services will be increased after reviewing the additional number of employees.” said a railway official, who attended the meeting.A state government official said the list was expected by Tuesday. “We have asked for the list of employees expected to travel by local trains from the organisations that are included in the list of the essential services. We expect the list to be provided by Tuesday, after which the planning for the additional services can be done. Around one lakh more employees will be permitted to travel by local trains, in addition to the existing lot of 1.5 lakh employees,” said an official on conditions of anonymity.The officer said that for now, nationalised bank employees have been allowed to travel by local trains. The state has allowed defence personnel, employees from customs, income tax, post offices to travel by trains meant for essential staffers. The officer added that they may consider allowing employees from private and cooperative banks at a later stage.On Sunday, the Western Railway announced the operation of 40 new train services. A total of 202 local train services will be operated on the slow and fast line. Services will be introduced between Churchgate and Virar railway stations.

30-06-2020||Mumbai||Coastal Road: Destroying corals violates wildlife laws, mangrove cell warns BMC||The forest department has cautioned the civic body on the threat to corals due to reclamation activity for the Coastal Road. The move comes following repeated complaints filed by residents, environmentalists and marine biologists over the safety of coral diversity.Corals are marine invertebrates that attach themselves to rocky intertidal regions or the ocean floor. They are given the same protection status as that of a tiger or an elephant (schedule-1) under the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972.Citing the presence of corals, in July 2019, the Bombay high court had questioned Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on reclamation activity without obtaining clearances under WPA.The mangrove cell under the forest department issued a letter recently to BMC reminding them about coral protection status under wildlife laws. “Corals have been reported from the Coastal Road project site, off Mahalaxmi, by the Mangrove Foundation, while studying intertidal coral diversity of Maharashtra. Several colonies of reef-building False Pillow corals (Pseudosiderastrea tayamai) have been observed in a large tide pool near the project site in Haji Ali,” the letter read adding, “Any act of destruction of coral species during the construction process shall amount to a violation of the WPA.”Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell) said, “Our team of marine biologists visited some sites over the past week. No destruction of corals has been observed so far. In some cases, we did not observe the coral presence due to the high tide. However, on-ground monitoring will continue.”Meanwhile, a letter signed by 250 Mahalaxmi and Haji Ali residents sent to state environment minister Aditya Thackeray on Monday requested the declaration of Mahalaxmi Bay area, the body of water from Mona apartments to the causeway at Haji Ali Dargah, as a marine sanctuary. “A possible way of achieving this would be to have a sea link rather than a road from Breach Candy club to the Haji Ali intersection. This would allow the Coastal Road project to proceed, while simultaneously protecting marine life,” the letter read, adding that residents were willing to maintain the Mahalaxmi Bay and the presently reclaimed area at their expense.BMC said they had stopped reclamation activity for a day to identify areas with coral presence following complaints. “A team from BMC, independent marine experts and researchers from National Institute of Oceanography visited areas in Haji Ali where the presence of corals could not be identified,” said Vijay chief engineer, BMC’s Coastal Road project. “In any case, we have appointed environmental experts and due care is being taken to protect eco-sensitive zones at project areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coastal-road-destroying-corals-violates-wildlife-laws-mangrove-cell-warns-bmc/story-wyDHxf7VYlYLNmr2R59P4K.html
30-06-2020||Mumbai||Address welfare issues of transgenders in 15 days, HC directs state govt||The Bombay high court has directed the social justice and special assistance department, of Maharashtra government to decide on the representations made by an activist working for the upliftment of members of the transgender community, within a fortnight. The activist had approached the court through public interest litigation (PIL) seeking various reliefs and a welfare scheme for the community which has been suffering economically since the lockdown. The activist had claimed that due to the stigma, members of the community were not getting any assistance which the government has extended to farmers, small traders and migrants during the lockdown. The court then directed the activist to directly approach the concerned department.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice MS Karnik while hearing the petition of Vikram Shinde, an activist through video conferencing was informed on Friday last week by advocate Aditi Saxena that the ever since the lockdown was imposed in light of the Covid 19 pandemic, the condition of the transgender community had become pathetic.Saxena submitted that as most members of the community are sex workers or begged for a living, the lockdown norms took away their means of livelihood, in the form of social distancing. She further submitted that while the source of income dried up, the members were refused necessities like free ration, as they did not have a ration or Aadhar card. They were also refused basic healthcare and protective kits due to the stigma attached to them.The petition said that while the community was marginalised due to the stigma, the lockdown made their condition worse as the government did not frame or announce any welfare scheme for the over 40,000 transgenders in the state. A couple of representations to the state in April and May had also gone unheeded, thus forcing them to approach the court, the petition said.The petition sought provision of free housing and employment as community volunteers, free ration for six months, payment of ₹5,000 to each member for the same period and provision of Covid and non-Covid medical assistance and to establish separate quarantine centres for the transgender persons. After perusing the petition, the bench said that it was disposing of the petition with the following directions, “The petitioner is granted liberty to file a comprehensive representation, incorporating all the concerns of the community he seeks to represent, within a week from date addressed to the principal secretary to the social justice and special assistance department, government of Maharashtra. Should the petitioner avail this liberty and submit the requisite representation, the principal secretary shall proceed to consider and dispose of the concerns expressed under the law and by passing an appropriate order within a further period of a fortnight.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/address-welfare-issues-of-transgenders-in-15-days-hc-directs-state-govt/story-A23elc7epGEHth0YitJWZJ.html

30-06-2020||Gurugram||Cops seize brown sugar worth ₹80 lakh from a slum in Sector 66||The police on Sunday late night busted a gang of drug smugglers and arrested a 24-year-old man from the Sector 66 slum area. The police also recovered 680 grams of brown sugar, worth ₹80 lakh, from his possession, said the police.The suspect was identified as Dilshad Sheikh, a native of Nadia in West Bengal, who had been living in Gurugram for the past two years. The police said he had been residing in the city for the last 10 years.Acting on a tip-off, the Sector 10 crime investigation agency (CIA) conducted the search operation. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the suspect was arrested from the spot and the recovered drug samples were sent to the lab for testing. “The contraband substance is suspected to have been bought from peddlers from West Bengal and was sold in Delhi-NCR Delhi through Sheikh. He is the middleman, who used to charge a commission of ₹10,000 per 100 grams and used to supply to two others, who were actively involved in selling the substance,” he said.During a preliminary investigation, it was allegedly revealed that the buyers used to visit Sheikh in the slum and on an average, he catered to 10 people daily.The neighbours told the police that they were unaware of his work. However, he carried expensive mobile phones , travelled in private cars and often bought expensive liquor and clothes, said the police.The police is interrogating Sheikh to find out details about the drug racket and the involvement of other people in the illegal trade.Sangwan said they have got details of the two dealers but they are on the run. “They used to purchase the drugs from Sheikh and them supplied to different parts of the city, along with Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, and nearby districts. This gang has been active for the past 10 years in the city and majorly smuggled brown sugar and heroin as they have high a profit margin and are easy to carry,” he said.Muhammad Akil, commissioner of police, said the contraband is smuggled by stuffing them in gunny bags that are covered by stacks of fodder or vegetables. “We have analysed over 200 cases of drug seizures during the lockdown. We have seen that most of the consignments are smuggled from Delhi, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh. “The peddlers are taking advantage of essential services truck ferrying vegetables and groceries, by trying to hide the drugs below or inside the items,” he saidA case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act was registered at the Sector 65 police station on Sunday night.The police said during lockdown they have arrested 101 people, recovered 880 kilograms of drugs from the city, including 1.5kg heroin. The police added that teams are deployed near all the farmhouses that are suspected as delivery hubs in Sohna, Bhondsi, and the Aravalis. These places are being closely monitored as they are hot spots for the sale of drugs. In the past, more than 100 people have been arrested form these spots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cops-seize-brown-sugar-worth-80-lakh-from-a-slum-in-sector-66/story-gmJ77oDhR62Ab0NgTb3KaM.html

30-06-2020||Gurugram||Haryana to start plasma therapy for Covid-19 as part of ICMR trial||Haryana will administer convalescent plasma therapy to select patients infected with the coronavirus disease(Covid-19) at all its state-run medical colleges, as part of the ongoing nationwide trial by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Medical colleges in five districts — Rohtak, Bhiwani, Jhajjar, Sonipat, and Nuh—are expected to start giving plasma therapy within a week, while other medical institutions such as SGT Medical College in Gurugram, and ESIC in Faridabad, are expected to follow suit soon after, officials said. State health minister Anil Vij took to the microblogging site Twitter on Monday and announced, “Haryana to start Plasma Therapy for treatment of Covid-19 patients in all its medical colleges after approval from ICMR.” The health minister’s statement comes on a day when the Covid-19 cases in the state touched 14,210 cases and total 232 deaths. The first patient from Haryana to be administered the convalescent plasma therapy, as part of the ICMR’s trial at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER) in Chandigarh, recovered earlier this month on June 12. The patient, a resident of Kurukshetra, had recovered from the deadly disease despite having severe pneumonia and requiring oxygen therapy. “This is a positive step. More and more testimonies about the effectiveness of plasma therapy are coming from all over India. Private hospitals registering trial patients have also seen some successes, this will make the treatment accessible to more people,” Dr Ram Prakash, district epidemiologist, Gurugram, said. Convalescent plasma therapy involves injecting antibody-rich plasma from recovered patients into recovering individuals to help them fight the infection.While at least one private hospital in Gurugram is offering plasma therapy as a mode of treatment, as part of the trial by ICMR (the apex medical body in the county), the treatment hasn’t started in many hospitals. Dr Prakash added that widespread use of convalescent plasma to treat Covid-19 in Haryana was still a few weeks away, given that the ICMR’s trial results are only expected after at least a month. For now, only trial patients at state medical colleges — including SGT Gurugram and ESIC Faridabad— will have the option available of availing the therapy, Prakash clarified. The number of medical colleges across Haryana that will partake in the ICMR trial is unclear so far. The additional chief secretary (health), Rajeev Arora, on Monday did not answer calls and messages seeking comment.Dr Dhruv Chaudhury, nodal officer for Covid-19 monitoring in Haryana and head of the department of pulmonary and critical care at PGIMS Rohtak, where plasma trials are expected to commence this week, said, “Rohtak, along with four other districts, is preparing a list of suitable patients who have recovered and can donate their plasma. The treatment, as per ICMR guidelines, can be used for patients at a moderate to severe stage of the infection. We will initially be using it to help patients who are not responding to ventilator support.” It has previously been used during the Sars and Mers outbreaks (which were also caused by viruses from the same family as Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19). Plasma is a major component of a person’s blood, making up almost 55% of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-to-start-plasma-therapy-for-covid-19-as-part-of-icmr-trial/story-EQBrKrVNHGy63AyhGG4C4J.html
30-06-2020||Gurugram||Intensive contact tracing, more rapid antigen tests in 8 large outbreak areas of Gurugram from today||The Gurugram administration has decided to launch an intensive contact tracing exercise along with antigen testing in the eight large outbreak regions of the city which will be put under a 15-day lockdown starting Tuesday.Officials of the district administration said that in order to break the chain of transmission in these areas, there would be strict curbs on the movement of people also, with only emergency travel permitted.As per the government order issued on Friday, a large outbreak is defined as a localised increase in Covid-19 cases within a defined geographical area in a village, a town or a city. The cases may or may not be epidemiologically linked. For operational purposes, a large outbreak is deemed to be present when there are 15 or more cases.”A containment zone, in comparison, has been defined as an area, which has five cases. To take stock of the measures that have been proposed to be taken up in the outbreak areas,, a meeting of nodal officers for Covid-19 was held on Monday. The meeting was chaired by Ashok Sangwan, divisional commissioner, Gurugram.Sangwan said that special antigen testing centres have been established in all the eight eight large outbreak regions , where people with influenza like symptoms can go, and get themselves tested free of charge. “Seven teams of the health department have been formed, which will conduct antigen testing at 56 centres at designated spots for which dates have been fixed,” he said.During the meeting it was further decided that strict restriction on movement of people will be imposed in all eight large outbreak regions and nodal officers have been appointed to ensure compliance.“The focus will be on conducting antigen tests, RTPCR tests and serological survey to identify Covid 19 patients and check community transmission of the virus. Individuals, who have come in close contact with Covid positive patients, will be tested to check the transmission of virus in these clusters,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. The department will also be conducting a large scale information awareness and communication outreach in the eight areas, some of which have reported at least 150 cases each.Yadav also said that apart from seven teams, four additional groups have been formed to conduct antigen tests at 66 designated spots in other containment zones of the city.As per directions issued by Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner on Monday, areas identified as large outbreak regions will be barricaded from Tuesday and will have only a single entry and exit point. The order further said that essential services will be made available by respective government departments and information regarding dos and dont’s, helpline numbers and other services will be made available in these areas. The police and other departments will ensure that any person entering or exiting these areas should have Aarogya Setu application installed, thermal scanners would be deployed at booths set up for asymptomatic screening. Pamphlets and masks will also be distributed in these areas.The Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikran, which is entrusted with the job of contact tracing, said that the authority will increase manpower and also launch web application to customize and share contact tracing data in real time.Jitender Yadav, administrator, HSVP, confirmed that they have decided to increase the people engaged in contact tracing in the large outbreak areas. “We have also developed a web-based application, which shall be introduced to gather data, update it real time, compile it and share it for easy accessibility. This will boost coordination with different departments and help contact tracing efforts,” he said.Apart from this, Yadav said private hospitals in Gurugram, which have taken land from HSVP on subsidized rates, have been asked to ensure that treatment is given to EWS patients as per agreement with the authority. “The hospitals have been asked to follow the norms so that patients from weaker sections of society can avail healthcare,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/intensive-contact-tracing-more-rapid-antigen-tests-in-8-large-outbreak-areas-of-gurugram-from-today/story-efYQHZxRJtsUcURbn5G6tM.html
30-06-2020||Chandigarh||HC stays Haryana’s move to hold exam for students opting science stream in Class-11||The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Monday stayed the Haryana government’s move to hold examination for students, who are opting science subjects in Class-11 in state schools.A bench headed by justice Manjari Nehru Kaul passed the order based on the plea of a group of private schools in the state. The private schools had challenged multiple rounds of communication from the Board of School Education, Haryana, which directed that the students wanting to opt for the science stream in Class-11 will have to take an examination. The board had also asked the school authorities to upload the consent of such students for the examination on the website by June 17, failing which the report or the result of the students would be treated as “zero”. The schools told the court that government move is discriminatory in nature. Further, given the current condition prevailing across the globe due to the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, holding examination was risky.The court was told that due to Covid-19 outbreak, the result was declared on based on an average and all the students have got the admission to Class-11. It was also pointed out that the higher and technical education departments came out with a notification on June 23 that forbade the holding of examinations by universities and colleges. The schools have demanded that the same policy be adopted by the students opting for science.The schools have also alleged that the move is in violation of guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs under Disaster Management Act, 2005. The court has sought response from the government and the state board, by July 6, further directing that the conduct of the examination will remain stayed till the next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-stays-haryana-s-move-to-hold-exam-for-students-opting-science-stream-in-class-11/story-KbBRyvhUiB9tqKt2KLa8FL.html
30-06-2020||Gurugram||MCG on the lookout for guest houses, schools, empty buildings that can be used as isolation centres||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is planning to use guest houses, government schools, colleges, paying guest accommodations (PGs), and ashrams in the city as isolation centres where patients infected with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) can be treated, said officials on Monday.MCG additional commissioner Surender Kumar held a meeting with officials from MCG, Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC), and the district education department in this regard at the civic body’s Sector 34 office on Monday.“In assistance with the education department and HSIIDC, we are preparing a list of all the guest houses, PGs, government schools, colleges, and ashrams that fall within MCG’s jurisdiction, and the list will be ready by the end of this week. We will use that information to identify buildings that have enough space to accommodate at least 25-30 Covid-19 patients,” Devinder Kumar, zonal taxation officer (ZTO) who attended the meeting, said.Kumar further said the MCG is also in the process of identifying vacant buildings which can be converted into isolation centres. The move comes after getting a nudge from chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar two week ago.There are around 3.5 lakh properties registered in MCG’s tax records. However, the MCG does not have any data on vacant buildings, said officials. A survey to identify empty buildings will be kicked off soon.“We don’t have any records on vacant buildings and will have to initiate a fresh survey for it. We are aiming to complete this survey within two months as it may take us some time to trace owners of such buildings and subsequently convince them to lease their properties to us,” an MCG official privy to the development said.On June 16, during a review meeting on coronavirus preparedness CM Khattar during a review meeting on coronavirus preparedness had directed authorities in Gurugram to identify vacant properties and convert them to isolation centres, citing that such buildings can accommodate a large number of residents if the Covid-19 cases spike significantly and there are shortages in hospital beds in the city. According to an estimate made by Vivek Kalia, nodal officer, hospital and ventilator management, if the number of cases increases to almost a lakh in August, the city would then require at least 37,000 beds and more than 2,000 ventilators. Currently, there are 48 hospitals in the city that have Covid-19 beds.On Monday, the total tally of Covid-19 cases in the district reached 5,260.MCG officials said they will be focusing their efforts in zones 1, 2 and 3, where the cases are significantly higher than MCG’s zone 4. As per MCG’s June 27 records, nearly 1,450 cases of coronavirus were reported from zone 1, over 1,200 cases each from zone 2 and 3, while zone 4 had around 800 cases.MCG’s zone 1 and 2 includes areas located on the left side of the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, the northern and western parts of the city. Zone 3 primarily includes areas falling on the eastern part of the city, starting from the Sirhaul toll till exit number 8 (sector 30/31 cut) on one side and till Ghata t-point on the other. Zone 4 mostly includes new sectors and areas falling along Golf Course Extension Road and Sohna Road.In collaboration with the district administration, the MCG has already tied-up with 18 RWAs for establishing isolation centres at their respective condominiums, gated societies, and colonies so far.In addition, MCG officials said they are also looking at identifying various community centres where Covid-19 patients who need oxygen support can be accommodated. Along with the health department, MCG is already in the process of establishing such a centre at a community centre in Sector 27 which will have more than 75 beds, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-on-the-lookout-for-guest-houses-schools-empty-buildings-that-can-be-used-as-isolation-centres/story-GBJZtTQFE0GExqOUgdP54I.html
30-06-2020||City||Six police teams deployed to trace missing man after his car found abandoned in Muzffarnagar||At least six teams of the Ghaziabad police and other police teams from Muzaffarnagar are trying to trace the whereabouts of a 36-year-old project manager of a Ghaziabad-based construction company after he was reported missing on June 26.The police said that Vikram Tyagi went missing while he was on way to his flat in a high-rise at Raj Nagar Extension from office. After his family tried calling him, his mobile was switched off around 7.45pm. After searching for him on their own they approached the police.Tyagi’s car was found abandoned in Muzaffarnagar on June 27 with bloodstains on some seats.“We have registered an FIR under IPC section 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder). There is still no trace of the missing man while his car, an Innova Crysta, was found in Muzaffarnagar—about 100km from Ghaziabad—with bloodstains on the middle seats. The car was also damaged from the rear end, which suggested it had taken a hit. The registration plates of the car were also missing,” said Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city).The police said they have also come to know two men were spotted in the car at a checkpoint near Khatauli in Muzaffarnagar district late Friday night. “Tyagi was not inside the car, but two men who were driving the car sped away when the police tried to stop them. Later the car was recovered in Muzaffarnagar. We have six teams deployed to trace the man and some teams from Muzaffarnagar district are also working on the case. We also scanned footage of CCTV cameras installed alongside the Delhi-Meerut Road, but we did not come across the car passing by in the footage,” Mishra added.According to the police, Tyagi’s last mobile location was found at Raj Nagar Extension just some distance from his home.The police added that Tyagi was not carrying much money on him and even his credit card was also not used anywhere. There was no deduction of any toll from the FasTag installed on his car, suggesting the person who was driving Tyagi’s car took a different internal route to reach Muzaffarnagar.“We are still investigating the entire incident and probing all angles. Our teams are also trying to trace the involvement of any gangs behind the incident. The family has still not received any ransom calls so far,” Mishra added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/six-police-teams-deployed-to-trace-missing-man-after-his-car-found-abandoned-in-muzffarnagar/story-bYAZFxSd55inWLREbdWgxI.html

The district’s daily test positivity rate (TPR) reached 10%, slightly up from Sunday’s a record low of 6.8%. Just two weeks ago, on June 14, the TPR was 100%.There were also six new deaths in the district on Monday, according to the daily epidemic bulletin of the district health department. Gurugram’s total mortality stands at 90 deaths, of which 55 patients died because of the presence of co-morbidities. Nearly 1.6% of the total reported Covid-19 cases have resulted in a loss of life. Gurugram on Monday also recorded 135 new recoveries (down from 279 the previous day), taking the district’s cumulative recovery rate to 73.8%. The number of active cases in the district now stands at 1,288 — down from Sunday’s tally at 1,327. Of these, 828 patients are currently under home isolation, while 59 patients have been hospitalised. The remaining 401 patients are under observation at various Covid-19 care facilities across the district.Gurugram on Monday also collected 931 new samples for testing, of which 330 were collected by the health department through targeted surveillance, using both antigen and RT-PCR tests, while 601 were arbitrary samples collected by private labs in the district. Health bulletins from June 16 onwards show that test results of most samples are being reported within a 24 hour period, thereby reducing Gurugram’s backlog of samples to 215, down from 221 on Sunday.

We will have a better idea of what the real picture if the numbers were provided under different heads.”Meanwhile, Haryana reported 381 number of cases on Monday, taking the total tally to 14,210 cases.

30-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram records 585% increase in Covid-related waste between April and June||The quantity of biomedical waste related to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the district has increased by 585% over the past three months, showed data compiled by Biotic — the concessionaire for biomedical waste management for Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG). In April, Gurugram amassed an average of 500 kgs of Covid-related biomedical per day. In June, this number exceeded more than 3,000 kgs per day, coinciding with a surge in the number of cases and deaths. On Monday, the total tally of Covid-19 cases in the district reached 5,260. Close to half of the city’s total medical waste now comes from the diagnosis and treatment of Covid-19 patients. In April, Covid-related waste accounted for just 14% of Gurugram’s total biomedical refuse collected. In June, this waste made up 48.5% of the total biomedical waste.In April, the district produced 15,076 kgs of Covid-related biomedical waste. In May, the quantity of biomedical waste ballooned to 33,502 kgs, more than twice what was produced the previous month. In June, the district generated 1,03,409 kgs of Covid-related biomedical waste or six times the amount produced in April.Meanwhile, the growth of routine medical waste collection remained stable at 94,369 kgs in April, 1,12,454 kgs in May, and 1,09,372 kgs in June. Experts said that Gurugram would soon start to produce Covid-related biomedical waste in excess of the routine waste produced from non-Covid procedures. “In cities like Delhi, biomedical and common waste management systems are already under strain. Gurugram and neighbouring districts with an increasing number of cases are also on their way there. My worry is that hazardous materials from Covid wards in Indian cities will get mixed up with regular waste as our own capacities run out,” said Sourabh Manuja, an environment and waste management fellow at The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), New Delhi.Manuja also cited examples from other badly hits regions from across the world. “In Wuhan, China, for example, the total amount of biomedical waste had shot up by six times soon after the outbreak. We have also been seeing reports from the US and Italy, which are struggling to deal with mountains of Covid-related waste. And these countries have a significantly higher capacity to tackle their garbage issues than us,” he added.Gurugram, for its part, is nearing its fully carrying capacity of Covid-19 related waste. From operating at 25% carrying capacity in April, Gurugram’s dedicated biomedical waste management facility in Sector 36 has now scaled up operations to absorb the growing demand. “We are now operating at a 60% capacity,” said Vikas Gahlot, spokesperson, Biotic. “We are managing everything according to the protocol for now. We can process 20 tonnes of waste per day, but are currently processing about 12 tonnes per day. As such, we have some spare capacity left,” he said. Presently, Covid-19 related bio-medical waste from homes is collected ward-wise. Biotic’s waste workers make two pickups from each ward every week, equipped with a list of addresses where people are under home isolation. “The caretaker of the patient is responsible for bringing segregated waste to the truck, after taking necessary precautions, such as wearing gloves and masks and putting the waste in a yellow bag,” said a zonal sanitation inspector. A separate vehicle makes daily pickups from about 36 other hospitals and Covid care facilities in Gurugram.Kuldeep Singh, the HSPCB’s regional officer in Gurugram, said, “We have notified state guidelines for Covid-19 biomedical waste which are being followed. If we see a scenario in which the capacity is not enough, we shall work with the corporation to find a solution and engage additional resources if needed.”Despite repeated attempts, commissioner of MCG did not respond to calls and messages for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-records-585-increase-in-covid-related-waste-between-april-and-june/story-oOHJD0AxrCJa7A6WjM2IWN.html
30-06-2020||Gurugram||Cops seize liquor worth ₹30 lakh from a truck transporting vegetables in Nuh||The Nuh Police on Sunday night intercepted a vegetable truck, bearing a tag of “essential services”, and seized 11,000 litres of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) worth ₹30 lakh near Adbar Chowk in Nuh, said police officials privy to the matter. The driver and helper were arrested from the spot, said the police. The incident was reported around 8pm on Sunday, when the police received a tip-off that some bootleggers were allegedly trying to smuggle liquor into Maharashtra through Nuh, the police officials said. A team of policemen from crime investigation agency (CIA) placed barricades near Adbar chowk in Nuh and spotted a truck coming from the side of Gurugram.Narender Bijarnia, the superintendent of police, Nuh, said when the police team checked the truck, they found that it was loaded with vegetables and had a bill for the same. “When the police team asked the driver and the helper to remove the cover for a further check, they told them that they were transporting vegetables to Maharashtra in cartons. A total of nearly 50 cartons in the front were loaded with vegetables. However, when one of the police officials checked further, he found cases of liquor,” Bijarnia said. According to the police, the truck had a total of 947 cases of whisky of an Indian brand that was for sale in Haryana only and were recently packed.According to the police, the driver and the helper have been identified as Manish Kumar and Vishal Singh of Pathankot in Punjab.Bijarnia said the police have taken the suspects on a two-day police remand to question them about the mastermind and other people involved in liquor smuggling. The police registered cases against the suspects under Section 61 of the Excise Act and sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Nuh police station“The suspects have earlier smuggled liquor to Maharashtra during the lockdown in trucks loaded with fruits, vegetables, and other essential items but were not caught. They were given the task of smuggling liquor to Maharashtra through a third party in Punjab who had loaded the liquor from Gurugram,” he said.“During questioning, the suspects also revealed that the mastermind is a liquor trader and has been involved in smuggling liquor to Maharashtra and Gujarat for the past several years and that they have been carrying liquor on the same route. The drivers are changed after every 50 kilometres so that they remain unaware of the details of the trader and the end-user,” said Bijarnia The police said liquor is commonly smuggled from Haryana to Maharashtra as it is cheaper here. Further, the government of Maharashtra had banned liquor in the state during the lockdown and continues to do so in some parts of the state. Liquor smuggling by interstate organised syndicates has increased in Maharashtra since lockdown was announced and liquor worth nearly ₹120 crore has already been seized by the police in the state since the lockdown was imposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cops-seize-liquor-worth-30-lakh-from-a-truck-transporting-vegetables-in-nuh/story-urWWLD0mdtD12CKzLrFrJN.html
30-06-2020||City||102-year-old Thane man beats virus||Through all the 28 days 102-year-old Sukha Singh Chabbra was under treatment for Covid-19 at a city hospital, he was unaware that he had contracted an infection that was ravaging the world.Chabbra on Monday became the oldest person in Thane city to win the battle against the virus and according to his family, the victory was all due to his willpower. Chhabbra’s grandson told HT that his grandfather’s hearing is weak and so he did not know much about the coronavirus. Chabbra, his grandson said, believed he was admitted for his cough, cold and some breathing issues and that was likely to have helped as Chabbra did not panic and was able to recover completely. Chabbra was greeted with huge applause and flowers from his family members after he was discharged on Monday.A resident of Cadbury junction in Thane (West), Chabbra, who was born in October 1917, tested positive for the virus on June 2. Taranjeet Singh, 32, his grandson, said, “Six of the eight members in my family have tested positive for the virus. I worked in the Gurudwara to provide food to labourers and government hospitals in Thane and contracted the virus during this service. He [Chabbra]got it from me. We both got admitted together and the first few days I was with him. My grandfather did not know much about the virus even though he watched the news. He is hard of hearing and was not aware of the pandemic. We told him he was admitted for cough and breathing problems. Since the fourth day of his admission to hospital, he was in ICU.”Singh said that his grandfather had a strong will to go home and meet his family, which kept him going. “He is now stable, although weak, but much better. My other grandfather, aged 86, is also infected and is still in ICU. He, however, knows about Covid-19 and is stressed, which is affecting his recovery, although he, too, is stable now.”Chabbra, who was a farmer and later went into construction business, was admitted in Kaushalya Hospital at Panchpakhadi. Dr Amit Lala Khomane , chief intensivist and head, department of critical care medicine at the hospital, said, “He required NIV (non-invasive ventilation) and inotropic supports to maintain his heart and lung functions for moderate ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) along with Covid pneumonia. It was the patient’s own determination to fight it out at this age, which helped him recover.”The hospital also sponsored his entire treatment as his story was an inspiration for all doctors of the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/102-year-old-thane-man-beats-virus/story-K9IaxzF9QiwbWBqnl0qNdJ.html
30-06-2020||City||Chief medical superintendent of Noida district hospital transferred||The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday announced a slew of transfers and appointments in the state’s health department, the notable among which was that of the chief medical superintendent of district hospital in Noida, who was shuttled to MMG District Hospital as a senior consultant. Though there was no official confirmation, sources believed that the transfer of the chief medical superintendent had been prompted by the death of a 30-year-old pregnant woman from Khoda, who was allegedly turned away by several hospitals in Noida and Ghaziabad.Following the woman’s death, the Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate had initiated an inquiry and on June 8 had recommended the transfer of the CMS, while stating that some “capable” officer should be posted.“The CMS of district hospital has been transferred to MMG Hospital, Ghaziabad as senior consultant. The posting is on same rank. Earlier the doctor was into administrative work and now she will be handling clinical work,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad.The probe report into the death of the pregnant woman had highlighted several lapses, including the fact that the ambulance that she was being ferried in had dropped her off at the district hospital in Sector 30, despite being scheduled to take her to Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida. From there, the woman was rushed to four private hospitals, all of who turned her away, citing lack of beds.By the time she finally reached GIMS, she had died.The report found the doctors who checked and referred her, as well as the driver of the ambulance which dropped her outside the district hospital, were liable for negligence.“If she had to be referred to a higher centre from the district hospital, a senior staff member should have taken that decision. Concerned staff should have informed the senior management,” the report said.“Such instances have occurred in the past as well and points to supervisory negligence. We have written to the state government to transfer chief medical superintendent (CMS) of the district hospital,” DM Suhas had said after he received the report.On Monday, DM Suhas LY did not comment over the transfer but referred the matter to Dr Deepak Ohri, CMO of Gautam Budh Nagar.“She has been transferred by the state government on the recommendations of higher district officials as she was found guilty of dereliction. The CMO office has no role in her transfer,” Dr Ohri, said.HT is withholding the name of the officer as she couldn’t be reached for her comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chief-medical-superintendent-of-noida-district-hospital-transferred/story-9Z2KeX6sRKVQMfiVP0l6II.html
30-06-2020||Noida||Results of random testing indicate low infection rate outside containment zones in Noida, say officials||Out of the 400 reports— of the 1,152 samples collected at random in the district for testing against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)— only six samples have tested positive, district officials said. The low positivity rate of the samples so far, officials said, established that the infection rate was high only in high-risk containment zones and densely populated, unorganised residential areas in the district.The random samples were collected on Saturday, and while the reports of the rest of the samples are still awaited, the reports of 400 samples came from the National Institute of Biology (NIB) on Monday.Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said the results of the random sampling so far, indicate that Covid-19 infection is mostly controlled in most of the areas in the district. “So far, over 16,000 samples have been collected in the district, out of which 2,204 persons have been tested positive so far. We are taking samples for lab-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests (RT-PCR), rapid antigen kit testing, and testing methods,” he said. Till date, 8,000 rapid antigen kits have arrived in the district, out of which nearly 1,000 have been used for testing. The remaining 7,000 kits are expected to arrive in a day or two, he added.The DM, however, said the threat of coronavirus was far from over in the district. “ To curb the spread, the administration needs to be hard sometimes. We will not allow anyone taking the relaxations under Unlock 1 for granted,” he said. “Our team of doctors is keeping a round-the-clock vigil to check the further spread of this virus in high-risk areas. On Monday, as many 39 office premises and containment zones have been thoroughly sanitised. The health workers are also sensitizing people to maintain social distance and wear masks while going out,” he said.The district on Monday reported 53 new cases taking the overall count of the district to 2,204 cases.District chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri, as many as 211 positive patients were discharged from different hospitals on Monday—the highest number of patints to be discharged in a single-day, taking the overall number of cured patients to 1,430 in the district. “So far, 22 Covid-19 positive patients have so far lost their lives in the district so far. The district now has 756 active cases,” he said.According to the daily state bulletin on Monday, the overall tally of the Covid-19 positive cases in the state has touched 22,828, with 685 new cases in the last 24 hours. “While 672 patients have lost their lives due to coronavirus infection in the state so far, 15,506 patients have been cured and discharged from different hospitals in the state” the bulletin stated.Meanwhile, the police on Monday, arrested as many as seven persons in connection with the violation of section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code. “Three cases under section 188 of Indian Penal Code have been lodged, while 2,132 vehicles were checked on Monday. One vehicle was seized and other 794 have been served fines,” the GB Nagar police commissionerate spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/results-of-random-testing-indicate-low-infection-rate-outside-containment-zones-in-noida-say-officials/story-FVgvJnkFKhZSz9MWVXEh9L.html
30-06-2020||City||Man killed, 2 injured in clash over property dispute||Following clashes between two factions over an ongoing property dispute in a village in Greater Noida, a 61-year-old man was killed on Monday afternoon while two others were severely injured.The incident was reported from Niyana village in Kasna area around 2pm. According to the police, the two factions have always been at odds with each other because of an old feud over property in the village.“Today [Monday], some people from one faction were unloading bricks from a truck. One person from the other faction was trying to pass the group in a car but was unable to because of the truck. This led to an argument which soon escalated when more relatives joined in from both sides,” Rajesh Kumar Singh, the deputy commissioner of police, zone 3, said.In the ensuing confrontation, 61-year-old Brijendra received a bullet injury and died, while his nephew Devendra’s hand was cut with an axe-like tool. Brijendra’s brother was also severely along with several other people from both factions.“The injured persons were taken to a private hospital for treatment while the body of the deceased man was sent for an autopsy,” the DCP said.The matter ended with locals informing the police, and four of the accused men, Rajkumar, his sons Nishant and Monti, and his father, Jasmal, were arrested from the spot while the rifle and axe used in the murder were also seized. The men will be produced before a magistrate on Tuesday. The police said that a complaint has not been filed in the matter yet as the family is busy tending to the wounded. However, a case will be registered soon.The rivalry started when a piece of property in the village was sold to both the parties by a broker a few years ago. Brijendra’s family currently occupies the property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-killed-2-injured-in-clash-over-property-dispute/story-tYlNPGGd1litBjJI8yIswL.html
30-06-2020||City||Traffic snarls continue at Noida-Delhi borders||Noida: More than two months after Noida sealed its borders with Delhi, commuting between the two cities during the peak hours continues to be a problem.While in the beginning the Noida police were only monitoring entry into the city after the relaxations in lockdown, from June 13, even exit from the city are being checked. Only commuters with requisite administrative passes and those engaged in essential services are allowed to travel across the border.It was last week of April when the administration had decided to seal the borders with Delhi in the wake of the rising number of cases in the national capital. With the district administration maintaining its status quo since then, commuters continue to face snarls in the border areas.The Noida police have placed barricades on both sides to regulate the movement at all border points like Chilla, Kalindi Kunj or DND.“The police barricades placed on both sides hold up traffic, specially during peak hours. Without the barricades, the traffic movement will be smooth even if police check each vehicle,” said a daily commuter.Some commuters claimed that crossing the border at DND or Kalindi Kunj takes more than 40 minutes on average. “During peak hours, traffic crawls on both sides. Checking is irregular and the traffic becomes worse on Mondays. I hope that the restrictions or at least the barricades will be removed from July 1. Today, Kalindi Kunj was so jam packed that we had to take a turn and go via DND,” said Amrinder Singh, a commuter travelling from Faridabad to Noida.Police officials said that there are no orders yet to revoke the border sealing.“Entry and exits are still being monitored at DND and Kalindi Kunj. But at Chilla border, checking is there only at entry point,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police.He said that peak hour traffic is still an issue but the police are trying to make the situation better by opening more lanes on the border at the DND flyway.Gautam Budh Nagar had sealed its border with Delhi to avoid the spread of coronavirus cases. According to data released by the district’s health department, many Covid-19 cases in the district have been traced to sources in Delhi. While some people, who have jobs or businesses in the other state, want the border to be opened, Noida residents have supported the administration’s decision to keep it sealed keeping in mind the Covid-19 spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/traffic-snarls-continue-at-noida-delhi-borders/story-jViHhSCbHaC8k091P41zvK.html
30-06-2020||City||Constable accused of extorting money from dairy owner sent to police lines||A police constable deployed at the Dankaur police station was sent to Surajpur police lines on Monday for allegedly extorting money from a local dairy owner over “fabricated” liquor smuggling charges.The alleged incident had come to light after a video, which purportedly shows the constable shouting and threatening villagers at Atta Fateghpur with a stick, started doing the rounds on social media.The victim, Zahid, a milkman and a local dairy owner, had filed a complaint with the police on Sunday in the matter. According to his complaint, he was on his way back home after making milk deliveries when he was stopped by the police who asked for his movement pass and other documents.When his documents were found incomplete, Zahid said in his complaint, he was falsely accused of being a liquor smuggler and was threatened that he would be sent to jail. The constable in question then allegedly demanded some money from Zahir in order to drop the bogus charges, the complaint read.However, seeing the commotion a few villagers rushed to the spot to defend Zahir and one of them captured the incident on video. The constable can purportedly be seen threatening the villagers and the person making the video.Following the complaint by Zahid and after the circulation of the video on social media, senior police officers took cognisance of the matter and an inquiry was conducted by a Greater Noida assistant commissioner of police.“The constable has been sent to police lines following the probe. He was disturbed from the past few days due to some health issues which could have led to the incident,” said Rajesh Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner of police, zone 3.Police officers also said that the constable had also gotten into trouble a few days ago when he was disrespectful to a senior officer during a meeting.As many as six cases of alleged police brutality have come to light since May 10 in Gautam Budh Nagar district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/constable-accused-of-extorting-money-from-dairy-owner-sent-to-police-lines/story-dQFVtPytY9exxfIlzAeTVI.html
30-06-2020||City||Ghaziabad’s only TrueNat machine out of order for three days||Ghaziabad: The district’s only TrueNat machine is out of order for the past three days after it developed a snag, severely affecting the Covid-19 testing in emergency cases, health officials said on Monday. The basic purpose of the TrueNat machine was to get results within an hour about the Covid-19 status of the patient who required emergency treatment such as a surgery. The machine had arrived in Ghaziabad about a fortnight ago to boost the testing capabilities in the district.“The machine is out of order for past three days. We had called up an engineer, but he was unable to repair it due to want of a component. We have already intimated twice the issue to the company. As of now, we are taking up tests through antigen kits which have recently been provided to the district,” said Dr Anurag Bhargava, chief medical superintendent of MMG District Hospital where the machine is installed.In May, the use of TrueNat machine was validated by the Indian Council of Medical Research for confirmatory detection of Sars-CoV-2 virus to boost testing capacities. While RT-PCR test results come in 24 to 48 hours, antigen testing, which provides results within half-an-hour, does not provide ‘true’ negative result of a patient, the officials said. The Ghaziabad health department had been carrying out about 30 to 40 tests through TrueNat machine, but the activity is now being taken up through antigen test kits, the officials said.“The TrueNat provides ‘true’ negative status of a Covid-19 patient while the antigen test provides ‘true’ positive result of a patient. In case the test result is not positive through antigen testing, we have to get negative result confirmed through RT-PCR test which takes time. As the TrueNat machine is out of order, it has hampered the testing,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.The TrueNat testing was also getting done in cases related to deliveries of women patients at the district women’s hospital. Doctors at the women’s hospital said they cannot stop deliveries even if they have to wait for the test results.“The reports of two patients were received after the deliveries. So, we got our doctors and nurses, who attended the deliveries, tested for Covid-19. But their reports turned negative. So, in absence of TrueNat test, we are taking risk as deliveries cannot be stopped or postponed,” said Dr Deepa Tyagi, chief medical superintendent of women’s hospital.The CMO said that one more TureNat machine has been sanctioned by the government and will arrive for the women’s hospital.At present, the Ghaziabad district has daily sampling capability of about 450 samples, including about 50 taken up by private labs, and these are sent to RT-PCR labs in Noida, Meerut or Delhi for testing purposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-s-only-truenat-machine-out-of-order-for-three-days/story-pCXNcOZftPIpSoRw8I9WJI.html
30-06-2020||Mumbai||Maha extends lockdown until July 31 with more restrictions||The Maharashtra government on Monday extended the ongoing coronavirus-enforced lockdown to July 31 and imposed stricter norms.A day after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray warned people of stricter restrictions if violation of lockdown norms continued, the notification issued by the government has reduced shopping timings, restricted jogging and running to the neighbourhood and also told people in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) that travel within the region is allowed only for coming to offices.The state government is also expected to defer its plan of extending relaxations by two weeks as cases in the state continue to increase significantly. With the addition of 5,257 cases on Monday, the number of people infected so far has risen to 1,69,883. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had announced on Sunday that there will be no lifting of the lockdown after it ends on June 30, although the state government will extend a few relaxations in a calibrated manner. He, however, had expressed his unhappiness over the crowding at public places in cities and even in rural parts of the state. He had said the administration would be forced to impose stricter curbs if citizens did not follow lockdown norms.While allowing non-essential shops to operate at regular working hours (9am to 9pm) on alternate days from June 5 under its Mission Begin Again — a staggered plan to lift curbs launched on May 31 — timings have now been restricted from 9am to 5pm for non-essential shops. This was after authorities reported unnecessary crowding on roads in the evening. It has also clarified that travel permissions given within MMR are only for essential services and to facilitate office-goers and not for shopping and non-essential items. The notification said that physical activities such as jogging, running and cycling, which were allowed from June 3, are allowed only in the neighbourhood. State government has also given powers to local authorities — district collectors, civic commissioners, police commissioners — to impose stricter norms according to the Covid-19 situation and if they feel necessary. The earlier order had mandated local authorities to consult with the state government in case any such need arose. The state government is now considering to defer proposed relaxations by at least a couple of weeks in the prevailing conditions with the surge in Covid-19 cases. “CM spoke about the relaxations in his address on Sunday, but they are unlikely to come through at least for next two weeks. Cases are rising rapidly and most of them are due to the opening up of activities. We are at crucial stage of the fight against the pandemic and in such a scenario, immediate relaxations would not be wise,” a state government official said, after fresh rounds of meeting on Monday. The state government was planning more relaxations for industrial and commercial activities and more transport facilities to supplement them. It was also planning to allow more staff in government and private offices. The notification issued on Monday by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta, exercising the powers conferred under Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act, said that the ongoing lockdown has been extended by a month as the government is convinced that it is still under the threat of the spread of the coronavirus. The state government has continued its demarcation of areas as red and non-red areas, on the basis of the spread of the disease. Areas governed by 19 municipal corporations, including nine in MMR, continued to be red zones with stricter lockdown norms. Maharashtra has 27 municipal corporations governing urban areas. Thackeray announced on Sunday that further relaxations will be rolled out under Mission Begin Again in a phased manner. The notification has said that the relaxations will be notified in due course. “The relaxations will be given by issuing separate notifications, like issued for earlier four phases, with due care and very cautiously,” said a state government official requesting anonymity. Mall, theatres, multiplexes, schools, colleges, gymnasiums, swimming pools remained to be shut across the state. Essential services have been allowed across the state, while shops and non-essential services are allowed with certain restrictions in red zones. Government and private offices are allowed to operate at 15 and 10% of their workforce (or 15 and 10 persons, whichever is greater) respectively. Non-essential services and intra-district public transportation have been allowed in non-red zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-extends-lockdown-until-july-31-with-more-restrictions/story-d8FsqHR2pPueNfRQJiX7UL.html
30-06-2020||Pune||Congress holds protest against fuel price rise||Maharashtra Pradesh Congress committee president and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat on Monday blamed the central government for the rising fuel prices. The Congress has appealed to the Centre to rollback the price hike. The Congress has decided to launch agitations across the country at the taluka level, starting June 30, against the hike.Thorat was in the city to attend meetings and was also present for the protest against the fuel price rise organised by the Congress city unit on Monday at Alka Talkies chowk.Thorat said, “The middle and lower middle class is already struggling for survival during the lockdown and instead of providing them help, the government is imposing fuel price hikes and looting the common public. When Manmohan Singh was the prime minister, despite high oil prices in the international market, he controlled the fuel prices in the country. Right now, the fuel prices are at the lowest level in the international market, but the situation in the domestic market is different.”Meanwhile, Thorat also took a review of the Covid-19 situation at the Council Hall and instructed the administration to put in efforts to bring down the mortality rate. Thorat said, “Malegaon city executed some measures which helped control Covid-19 spread there. The administration must seek and adopt good practices.”Congress party’s city unit president Ramesh Bagwe; former MLA Mohal Joshi; Balasaheb Shivarkar; Ulhas Pawar and Abhay Chajjed, Kamal Vyware, Gopal Tiwari, among others were present for the protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/congress-holds-protest-against-fuel-price-rise/story-NnVOJbT6wQr44mQ4bxk8SJ.html
30-06-2020||City||Ghaziabad ADM and his SDM wife test positive||Ghaziabad The additional district magistrate (ADM) of Ghaziabad city and his wife, who is sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) at Jewar in Gautam Budh Nagar district, have tested positive for Covid-19, officials of district administration said on Monday. The results have set alarm bells ringing in the top brass of the Ghaziabad district administration as well as some senior police officials who were in regular touch with the ADM for implementation of Covid-related guidelines in the district.While confirming that the two officials have been found positive, Ghaziabad district magistrate said that all protocols will be followed as the ADM participated in important meetings during the ongoing Covid-19 crisis.The ADM and his wife are admitted at Yashoda Hospital in Kaushambi at present. Officials of the hospital said that they both were admitted to the hospital on Sunday. “The ADM is asymptomatic, while his wife (who is SDM) is having mild symptoms. The SDM initially tested positive for the virus and later the ADM also tested positive. Both were admitted to our hospital on Sunday,” said Dr Sunil Dagar, spokesperson of Yashoda Hospital, Kaushambi.According to the district officials, the ADM had also been part of almost majority of important meetings, video conferences at the office of the Ghaziabad district magistrate where police and health department officials also attended proceedings.“The ADM has been a key officer. He was assigned important tasks of late for implementation. We will follow all protocols as for any normal Covid-19 patient. The office of the ADM, which is part of the DM office, is also sealed for 24 hours and sanitization is being taken up. He last met me three days ago. His wife, the Jewar SDM, has also tested positive for Covid-19,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad.Sources in the administration said that the ADM was also present during the inauguration of the L1 category Divyajyoti Hospital in Niwari along with the other senior administrative and health department officers. The Niwar facility has been opened a couple of days ago.

The process to rent out PMPML buses has begun, and two buses have been rented out to a private company.“Earlier the rate for renting a PMPML bus was Rs 83.50 per kilometre with a minimum of 2,000 kilometres per month. It was conveyed to us by most companies that the rate is high, and so we didn’t get much response,” said Nayana Gunde, chairman and managing director (CMD), PMPML.“In the last three months during the lockdown, we have faced losses of at least Rs 150 crore and so the decision to revise the rates was considered,” she said.“Our per kilometre bus income is of Rs 50 and so the new rate will fall between Rs 50 to Rs 60,” said Gunde.“Once we start getting orders from nearby depots the buses will be sent to companies in a stipulated time,” she said.“We will be providing buses to Chakan, Hinjewadi, Bhosari, Chinchwad and other MIDC companies, government and private offices and IT companies as per their requirement. Monthly basis agreement will be done and the buses will be given on rent,” she added.Sameer Gade Patil, owner of Gajanan automobile parts manufacturers, Chakan MIDC, said, “At least 200 workers are working in our manufacturing unit and most of them live around the MIDC. If we get PMPML buses at affordable rates then certainly we will hire them for pick-up and dropping facility of our workers.”“Earlier we were not providing this service but now due to Covid pandemic and to get maximum workers at the company this facility will be provided,” he said.Get in touchTo rent a PMPML bus, contact – 020 24503300||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmpml-revises-rates-of-its-buses-on-hire/story-ZiN6UNkEm5QyfGhh4vhYVK.html

30-06-2020||Mumbai||State sees 5,257 new cases; tally is 169,883||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 case count reached close to 1.70 lakh with 5,257 more infections, pushing the tally to 169,883. Of them, 73,298 are active cases, according to the state health department. Monday was the fourth consecutive day fresh cases crossed the 5,000 mark. With state officials expecting a peak in July, the number of fresh cases is likely to further rise and the situation may become more difficult in the coming days. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday has confirmed that there will be a spike in infections in the next few weeks as they have opened up activities and are giving further relaxations to ensure revival of the economy. State health minister Rajesh Tope, too, said that the peak had started.The state recorded 181 deaths on Monday, taking the toll to 7,610. Of them, 78 deaths were from the past 48 hours, while the rest were from past few days, health officials said.Mumbai has 76,765 cases after adding 1,226 more infections in the past 24 hours. Of them, 28,749 are active cases. Mumbai’s toll stands at 4,062 after 92 deaths were reported.As the struggle against coronavirus becomes more challenging on account of the spike in cases, the state government on Monday extended lockdown for another month till July 31. It has empowered all municipal commissioners and district collectors to impose necessary restrictions in their jurisdiction to contain spread of the pandemic, whenever required. It has further restricted long distance travel for non-essential items in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), comprising nine cities including Mumbai, where cases are rising rapidly. In Mumbai, police have restricted travel up to 2-km distance for residents, except for officegoers and essential services.The chief minister also expressed discontent over people stepping out and crowding places unnecessarily. “When the pandemic is reaching its peak, people in and around Mumbai are found stepping out of their homes and travelling unnecessarily. This is not expected. The spread that was contained and restricted by far, has now started rising and will turn into a big challenge before us,” Thackeray said in a review meeting he chaired on Monday. “As we have been opening up activities to ensure revival of the economy, we have been witnessing a rise in cases. As part of the relaxation, people step out of their homes, come in contact and spread the virus. Even in the near future, there will be a rise in cases as we open up more activities,” the chief minister said on Sunday in his address through Facebook live.“As the chief minister has said, we are expecting a rise in infections as we have been relaxing restrictions. But unlocking was done in a phased manner, because we have anticipated this and are also prepared for the situation. The health infrastructure was augmented to deal with the spike in cases. It also appears that the projection about the peak in July will be proved correct,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.On Sunday, Thackeray had warned people with stricter restrictions if violation of lockdown norms continued.Tope said, “We have started unlocking restrictions, but it is also subjective. If people are showing carelessness and found not following norms, which will result in rise in cases, then local authorities such as municipal commissioners and district collectors have been empowered to take decisions to impose lockdown.” The number of cases in MMR is rising rapidly. On June 3, it had 55,086 cases, which has increased to 1,15,021 on June 29, revealed figures of the state health department. In a meeting chaired by the chief minister to review the crisis in MMR last week, more stress was given on building jumbo hospitals in satellite cities because they don’t have enough health infrastructure to cope with the crisis in case of a peak. The chief minister instructed local authorities to focus on augmenting health infrastructure as we have to be prepared in advance,” said an official, privy to the development. Following the spike in cases, the Thane municipal corporation on Monday declared a complete 10-day lockdown in the city, starting from July 2. The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation has also imposed a seven-day complete lockdown in 10 containment zones from Monday. Thane and Navi Mumbai have 9,644 and 7,677 cases respectively.Districts such as Ratnagiri and Hingoli, too, have decided to impose strict lockdown to contain the spread. Ratnagiri will see complete lockdown for eight days from July 1, whereas Hingoli has started its implementation for five days from Monday, but it is restricted only for Kalamnuri city. Ratnagiri and Hingoli have 570 and 266 cases respectively. Monday was also the 20th day the state has reported over 3,000 cases in a day. With 7,429 deaths on Sunday, the case fatality rate (CFR) of the state was recorded as 4.51%. It is the second-highest in the country after Gujarat, where the CFR is 5.77% with 1,809 deaths (31,320 cases) till Sunday, revealed statistics shared by the state medical education department. Maharashtra still has highest number of deaths across states in the country. By the end of May, the state has successfully brought down the CFR to 3.26% (on May 26) from 7.41% (with 148 deaths) on April 13. The tally of recovered patients also reached 88,960 after 2385 patients recovered on Monday. With this, the recovery rate has reached 52.37% The health department declared to have conducted 9,43,485 tests at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra. Of them, 7,73,602 people tested negative. It means 18% of the total samples tested positive, said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-sees-5-257-new-cases-tally-is-169-883/story-ZeLmIgUzBUQvouP0W0MWUM.html

It is our humble and earnest request to your good office to take immediate cognizance of the aforementioned incidence and initiate an impartial and independent probe as any further delay will reduce the importance of the event and the basic sanctity of any investigation against the Tamil Nadu police,” read the application.The two were referring to the custodial deaths of father-son duo P Jeyaraj (50) and J Bennicks (31) by officials of Santhankulam police station, Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu.The two deceased men were arrested under Sections 188, 269, 294 (b), 353 and 506 (2) of the Indian Penal Code for keeping their shop open after permitted hours.The two lawyers have alleged that the father-son duo was assaulted by inserting batons in their rectum, based on media reports.Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami-led state government of Tamil Nadu had asked for the case to be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The Madurai bench of Madras High Court on Monday gave its approval for transfer of the case to CBI.Recent custodial death cases in Maharashtra-Salma Sonu Attar (25) alleged that her husband Sonu Gani Attar (35) was killed after government railway police (GRP) officials arrested him for suspicion of petty theft in July 2019.

30-06-2020||Pune||Post-infectious Covid-19 inflammatory syndrome reported in children below 18: study||Four children who were admitted to the Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital showed symptoms of the Kawasaki disease, like swelling of hands and feet, peeling of the skin, coronary artery (heart blood vessel) dilatation, persistent fever and other signs of inflammation.All the four children are residents of containment zones in the city.Covid-19 positive children in countries like the US, UK and Italy have reported similar symptoms. Such cases were also reported in China, and India has also begun reporting these symptoms, in cases in Mumbai.While experts say it is not exclusively associated with the Covid-19 infection, it can cause a serious condition and must be reported immediately. The four children at Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital who were admitted on June 3 when first such case was reported were put on a ventilator and needed drugs to increase the pumping action of heart and antibiotics.Dr Jitendra Oswal, paediatric rheumatologist, Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital and Dr Bhakti Sarangi, -charge of paediatric critical care services, have worked on a study which states that these signs could be caused post the Covid-19 infection and usually occur after four weeks.The study also states that the condition is seen in children who test positive for Covid-19 RT PCR and exclusively in between the ages of 10-18 years. It is a serious condition which requires intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. One child among the four in Pune, according to the Bharati Vidyapeeth doctors, developed swelling of hands and feet, peeling off the skin of fingers and coronary artery (heart blood vessel) dilatation similar to that seen in the Kawasaki disease.A second child also had coronary artery dilatation, but, both these children were discharged.While the third child died of multi-organ injury, the fourth child is recovering and was recently taken off the ventilator.Dr Oswal said, “Although none of the kids tested positive for Covid-19 and neither had their family members test positive for the infection, they lived in the Covid-19 containment zone. We have treated about 50 Covid-19 positive kids in April and May most of them were asymptomatic and the rest had only mild symptoms. So it is quite possible that the kids were infected with Covid-19 and it went undetected as they were never tested for it. When we say it could be post infectious Covid-19 inflammatory syndrome it means that the antibodies produced at the time by the immune system attached itself to the internal organ tissues which caused inflammation. When it comes to children, the immune system may work in a different way.”According to Dr Oswal, three of the four children tested negative, but one child first tested positive at a private lab and then tested negative for the infection within 24 hours when the samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV).“It could be because of false negatives which is possible in 33 per cent of the cases or because they never have any respiratory symptoms and so they are never tested,” Dr Oswal said.Dr Arati Kinikar, head of the department of paediatrician at BJ Medical college said, “Such post-infectious inflammation is known across the globe and also recorded by WHO. It is not exclusive to Covid-19 infection, but it is serious and so has to be reported immediately if a child has recovered from Covid-19 infection or any viral infection in the past four-sixweeks. The child can be tested negative for the infection because the virus has left their body system. The signs of post-infection inflammation include fever, they may appear swollen, redness, rashes, but again it is not exclusively linked to Covid-19. Parents must not panic because of this as many bacterial infections too, especially during the monsoon, could have similar signs; however, it must be reported immediately.”Dr Kinikar further added that no such case has been reported from Sassoon hospital’s paediatric ward till date. The study also states that the children usually do not have respiratory symptoms, but more gastrointestinal symptoms, and that the Covid-19 RT PCR test maybe negative. These children’s clinical condition deteriorates very fast in just a few hours, and in an acute phase the child can die due to heart or multi-organ failure. If the coronary arteries are inflamed, it can be damaged and permanently dilated and there is a risk of either a block or rupture and death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/post-infectious-covid-19-inflammatory-syndrome-reported-in-children-below-18-study/story-A6HdV8CiRm2yTcGZV2PziI.html
30-06-2020||Noida||Noida man dies of Covid-19, family gets Rs 14 lakh bill||Amid lack of clarity regarding the rates that Noida’s private hospitals may charge for the Covid-19 treatment, a private hospital has given a bill of over Rs14 lakh to the kin of a Covid victim who was admitted at the facility for 20 days. The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has said that it will look into the matter. The patient, a Noida resident and a Unani practitioner who died on Sunday, was admitted at Fortis Hospital, Noida, on June 7 and was kept on ventilator for 15 days, hospital authorities and close relatives of the victim said. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe family took possession of the body on Monday against a legal declaration on a Rs10 stamp paper to pay the negotiated amount, one of the relatives said. The hospital gave a bill of over Rs14 lakh to the grieving family, which was later revised to Rs10.2 lakh after the insurance covered Rs4 lakh while the family paid Rs25,000, as per hospital authorities. However, the Fortis Hospital, in a statement sent to HT, said that the charges were transparent, discounted and “based on the CGHS (central government health scheme) tariffs as per the MoU with the government”.“The family of the patient was informed about the treatment details at every step and was also counselled about the criticality of the patient…The details have been submitted to the CMO office as well. Our transparent billing process ensured that the family of the patient was kept informed about the expenses incurred during the treatment. There is no discrepancy in the billing process in this case,” said the statement from the hospital. Meanwhile, the district administration said that the private hospital fee is based on “self-regulation”. “We are looking into the matter. But the media reports about the charges levied by the private hospital for the Covid-19 patient seem unverified. The health team has been asked to look into the matter,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.Asked if the district administration has imposed a cap or upper limit on the charges levied by private hospitals to treat a Covid-19 patient, the DM said that charges are based on the ‘self-regulations’ and different guidelines, including those of the central government. “The private hospitals are charging based on the self-regulation and the guidelines given by the health department that had been communicated to them. There are various government advisories on the maximum or upper limit of charges. For ICU, the maximum amount which can be charged is Rs10,000 while for the ventilator it’s Rs5,000 extra per day. The other charges like medicines, etc, are not included,” the district magistrate added. However, despite several requests to share the official document that verifies the district administration’s claims on capping of charges for Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals, the administration officials stated they will share it soon.According to senior state health department officials, the decision on capping of prices in private hospitals has to be taken by the district administration concerned.“It’s the local administration of every district that would take a call and fix an upper limit on the charges that a private hospital can take for Covid-19 treatment. The state government has only fixed charges for the Covid-19 tests,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, health secretary, Uttar Pradesh.Meanwhile, the deceased’s family stated that there was no clarity on the maximum hospital fee in UP, as declared by other states like Haryana and Delhi.“There is no clarity on Covid-19 charges here. No order has been issued in this regard by the state government. We are still in talks with the hospital. We have lost a family member, and then are being asked to pay such unreasonable fee. We wish no one else has to suffer in future,” said a close relative of the Covid-19 victim.Recently, both Delhi and Haryana capped the prices for Covid treatment in private hospitals. A Delhi government order dated June 20 prescribes maximum per day package rates for Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals. According to the order, for isolation bed charges can’t exceed Rs10,000 while for severe sickness (ICU without ventilators) it’s Rs15,000 and for ICU with ventilator care the cost is Rs 18,000. All the cost includes the cost of PPE kits. In Haryana, prices for private hospitals accredited by National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Health Care Providers (NABH) are Rs 10,000 for isolation beds (including supportive care and oxygen), Rs 15,000 for intensive care unit (without ventilator care) and Rs 18,000 for intensive care unit with ventilator care.For the non-NABH accredited private healthcare facilities, Rs 8,000 a day has been fixed for isolation beds (including supportive care and oxygen), Rs 13,000 a day for intensive care unit (without ventilator care) and Rs 15,000 a day for intensive care unit with ventilator care. The rates will include charges for all lab investigations, diet, radiological diagnostics, monitoring charges, drugs, consumables, including PPE, masks and gloves, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-private-hospital-charges-over-14-lakh-for-treatment-of-covid-19-patient-for-20-days/story-9RIpoB3wrrHOueMNGD60ZI.html
30-06-2020||Pune||Obesity, hypertension, diabetes critical factor in Covid-19 fatalities||Obesity, a root co-cause of hypertension and diabetes, together a triumvirate of comorbid conditions fatally affecting patients infected with Covid-19, has become a critical factor in doctors assessing infected patients.Dr Vijay Natarajan, chief executive officer (CEO), at the Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Centre (SUHRC) said, “We have reported cases in our hospital where the patient was morbidly obese. It is very uncommon that someone who is obese does not have diabetes or hypertension. Obesity causes sleep apnea which affects the lungs and so, causes breathing problems. Since the virus causing Covid-19 affects the lungs and respiratory system, it affects an obese person even more so.”According to the integrated disease surveillance programme, Pune, of its 720 deaths related to Covid-19 in the Pune district, as of June 28, had 87 per cent or 623 deaths with an associated risk factor. Of that at least 44 have been diagnosed as being morbidly obese.According to Dr Abhay Tidke, district surveillance officer, health department, Zilla Parishad, there were six cases in the month of April and 14 in May that showed obesity as a comorbid condition. “In the month of April we reported six deaths in which obesity was a comorbid condition, then in May, it rose to 14, and then the remaining cases were reported in June. The common age group wherein obesity is reported is above the age of 37. In some cases, mild obesity can be ignored or neglected,” said Tidke. The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a person overweight when the body mass index (BMI) is greater than, or equal to 25; and obesity is for those for whose BMI is greater than or equal to 30.BMI is a simple index of weight for height which is calculated in kilogrammes divided by the square of the height in metres (kg/ m2). It is the same formula for all ages and genders. “We are reporting more number of critical patients who are obese. It becomes difficult to treat in this case and also recovery takes more time. Obesity is an underlying condition in patients who also report diabetes and hypertension,” said a doctor at Sassoon Hospital who didn’t wish to be named.Dr Dileep Kadam, who heads the Pune task force said, “Obesity could cause obstructive sleep apnea which complicates treatment and recovery of the patients. When obesity combines with other health ailments like diabetes and hypertension, which is another common comorbid condition among those who lost their life due to Covid-19, it can further complicate the situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/obesity-hypertension-diabetes-critical-factor-in-covid-19-fatalities/story-sSsNgsnhE1D4z79PlSDmWO.html

Experts said the rapid antigen tests are providing a better picture of the spread of the infection since so far only those with symptoms in containment zones were being tested. With random sampling in containment zones and areas around them, and rapid testing, the outcome of these tests provide a more representative picture, they said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage The rapid antigen test, a much faster way to confirm positive cases, was started as part of the Centre’s and the state government’s efforts to ramp up testing in Delhi. “We are conducting close to 7,000-12,000 rapid tests per day. These tests are being done mostly in containment zones and its neighbouring areas. It is also being done in some other areas. It is helping us isolate positive cases early, as the test results are out within 30 minutes,” said a senior Delhi government official with the revenue department, which is compiling the testing data.The results, a district magistrate said, were used to identify new clusters of Covid-19 cases and redraw boundaries of the containment zones. On Sunday, the Delhi government increased the number of containment zones from 280 to 421.Tests that detect presence or absence of an antigen in the body are called antigen detection tests. An antigen is a foreign molecule that induces an immune response within the body, especially the production of antibodies, and detecting its presence determines infection. Delhi is the first state to roll out antigen-based testing as Covid-19 cases in the city have seen unusual surge in the number of cases, making it imperative to conduct large-scale quick testing to trace, treat and isolate the infected individuals. Till Monday, Delhi reported 85,161 cases and 2,680 deaths due to the infection.The test has high specificity (true negative rate) of 99.3% to 100%, which rules out people who are not infected. Tests with a high specificity are most useful when the result is positive. Sensitivity (true positive rate) is lower at 50.6% to 84%, which makes it less accurate in correctly diagnosing a positive case. This is why people with symptoms who test negative have to undergo an RT-PCR test to rule out active infection.“The antigen test helps us understand the prevalence of the infection. We could identify clusters where the number of cases is more and have redrawn the boundaries and added new areas accordingly,” the district magistrate said.This, another district magistrate said, will help in de-sealing containment zones at the earliest. “With this, we are able to identify positive cases and take them out of the zone or place them in home isolation. This way we can scale down the containment measures as soon as cases will go down,” said another official.Dr T Jacob John, professor emeritus and former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College at Vellore, “It (the positivity rate) reflects the situation at the ground. If it is 7.46% in containment zones and neighbouring areas, then chances are that the positivity rate in non-containment areas would be far less.”A doctor with the district surveillance team said the rapid antigen test has expedited the Covid management process, as the cases are detected early. “The test has proved to be helpful in faster detection of positive cases in containment zones. We are able to identify and isolate these cases early. The RT-PCR test takes longer than a rapid test, so the detection of a case, its contact tracing, etc used to take time. But now we are able to take prompt action and check the spread of infection,” said the doctor, who didn’t wish to be named.The conventional real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test requires five to six hours to give results and specialised laboratory facilities in terms of equipment, biosafety and biosecurity.Early detection, doctors say, will help in keeping fatality rate in check, as timely diagnosis and treatment can be provided to patients. “When you pick up the infection early, it brings down the fatality rate since timely treatmentis key in managing and containing this disease,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former epidemiology and communicable diseases head at the Indian Council of Medical Research.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine at Safdurjung hospital, said, “The positivity rate through RT-PCR is high as those with symptoms or contacts of positive cases were getting tested. But now as we are testing people in the community using the rapid antigen test, the prevalence rate would be less as we are testing even those who don’t have any symptom.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/antigen-test-shows-7-46-positivity-rate-in-containment-zones/story-HtDcgeI2QNK2WExVEqt8AI.html
30-06-2020||Delhi||Re1 crore ex-gratia for family of Lok Nayak doctor who died of Covid-19||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday announced an ex-gratia amount of Rs 1 crore for the family of Dr Aseem Gupta, a professor of anaesthesiology and in-charge of Lok Nayak Hospital’s first Covid-19 intensive care unit, who died of Covid-19 on Sunday, describing him as a doctor known for going out of his way to serve his patients. “Dr Aseem Gupta, a senior doctor of LNJP Hospital, succumbed to Covid yesterday (Sunday). He was known for going out of his way to serve his patients. We have lost a very valuable fighter. Delhi salutes his spirit and sacrifice. I just spoke to his wife and offered my condolences and support,” Kejriwal tweeted on Monday.Also read: Delhi to get plasma bank to help Covid-19 patients: CM Arvind KejriwalExpressing his condolences, lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal said, “Deeply saddened at the death of Dr Aseem Gupta of LNJP who served tirelessly in fight against Covid-19. He was a great warrior who brought glory to the front line doctors and health workers. My utmost sympathies are with family members!”Gupta, who joined Lok Nayak hospital’s anesthesia department in 2004, was admitted at Max Smart Hospital in Saket with Covid-related complications since June 8. The 54-year-old had been in the ICU for almost two weeks. His wife, Nirupama Gupta, is a radiologist in Ghaziabad, where the couple lived. The couple has two sons, one of whom is studying in Australia and other is studying medicine in Dehradun.Dr Gupta’s colleagues in the anaesthesia department at Lok Nayak remember him as a person who was there for everyone who needed help. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“He was there, especially for the poor and those in need. He would work extra hours so that surgeries are done on time. He had a lot of contacts and he used them to help out people in need. He was also quite popular among resident doctors and spent time with them, which was apart from usual work-related conversations. He loved sports very much, and would sometimes get passes for cricket matches that he happily passed on to others. A very helpful chap; that is how we remember him in the department,” said associate professor, Dr Amit Kohli.Some friends called him ‘Mr Dependable’'. “I knew him for 20 years, and he was absolutely dependable. He would never say no to anything within his reach. He would go out of way to help. He was easy to work with and totally non-controversial. He was so popular among the fraternity that he was slated to take over as secretary of the Indian Medical Association’s east Delhi branch on July 1. We were going to soon announce it as we knew he was improving well. We were told he was recovering well and would have been moved to a ward soon,” said Dr Vinay Agrawal, past national president, Indian Medical Association.“He liked singing and dancing a lot. A total go-getter he was. No one expected the complication to arise,” Agrawal said.“Will always remember Aseem fondly. He was senior resident in anaesthesia while I was in my second-year masters of surgery at KGMC Lucknow. For so many emergency cases, I would just run back to the senior resident in the anaesthesia duty room, and finding him sitting there would reassure me the case would go smoothly. He would say in his booming voice , ‘Aur, Amit, kya kaat raha hai aaj, chal saath mein kaateinge’,” (So, Amit, what are you cutting, let’s cut it together),” recalled Dr Amit Gupta, professor, department of surgery, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.“After I moved to Delhi, we could not meet that often but whenever we met, he would always say, ‘aur Amit, abhi tak kaat raha hai’ (So, Amit, you’re still busy cutting),” said Dr Gupta.Infection among health care workforce is an area of concern, and Dr Gupta was also infected on duty. He was one among the scores of health care workers in the national Capital diagnosed with Covid-19. Lok Nayak had last month lost a senior OT technician to Covid-19, with unconfirmed reports that three employees who recently died at RML Hospital also tested Covid positive.Dr Jitendra Nath Pande, an eminent pulmonologist and former head of the department of medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi, died of Covid-related complications in May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-crore-ex-gratia-for-family-of-lok-nayak-doctor-who-died-of-covid-19/story-hmDtiu0gV057k1TSIAvhvN.html
30-06-2020||Delhi||Slow OPDs, delayed surgeries at top private hospitals||The three-year-old son of Sandeep Rajput, who works as a technician for a leading car-manufacturing company, has not stopped crying from pain. he toddler has a severe ear infection that needs immediate surgery. But, for the last two weeks, his parents have been struggling to get a date for an operation at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, which is one of Delhi’s largest private hospitals.“You can see the puss oozing out of his infected ear; it stinks and the doctor who saw him two weeks ago had also said that he needed surgery at once. We have been trying for the past two weeks. But are told to come back later. On Friday, we went to the hospital again and they asked us to come back on Monday. Today, the wait was very long, so we were asked to come again on Tuesday. The delay, they said, happened because the Covid areas were being segregated from non-Covid areas,” he said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“It is getting difficult to manage him. He’s been in great pain for the past two weeks, and the symptoms began a month ago. We requested the hospital for an appointment on Friday, and now it’s Tuesday. I hope it does not get delayed further,” added the boy’s mother Neelam, even as she struggles to pacify him..Elsewhere, Praveen Kuchhal’s younger brother, who is 48 years old and did not want be named, said he had to wait for a month before he underwent a surgery to get one of his kidneys removed at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. “It was taking long but then we thought it was good the hospital is taking precautions. Not just patients, but even doctors have to be confident about surgery. It was inconvenient, but we had no choice,” the man, who is a Delhi-based businessman, said.The Delhi government last month asked Gangaram hospital to be converted into a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) care centre. Ever since the government order, the hospital has been working to make the necessary arrangements, leading to delays and often inconveniencing patients.The hospital at present has 204 Covid beds, of which 134 are occupied, as per the Delhi Corona app on Monday.The hospital’s out patient-departments (OPDs) now barely treats 250 patients in a day, as compared to around 2,000 that it used to before the pandemic set in and strict social distancing measures were put in place.“We have been visiting this hospital for years now. It has always been busy. Earlier also, it would take time for consultation, admission, billing. But this time around, things are different and it is taking longer than usual. Even getting an appointment with a doctor takes long. There are fewer patients and even fewer doctors. People were saying it is happening due to Covid-19,” said Raj Kumar, Noida-based businessman dealing in dairy products. Kumar’s uncle is undergoing treatment in the orthopaedic department of the hospital.The hospital — one of the busiest private health hubs in the city — has been working at nearly 45% of its doctor strength in its OPDs for the past couple of months due to Covid restrictions.From 45 OPDs running six days a week that treated 40-50 patients each, the hospital has reduced consultations to about 10-12 patients per OPD. There are no more than 15 OPDs running for two-three days in a week now.“There is too much panic. You can see the staff being extra cautious, which is understandable as this disease is highly infectious. We are grateful that at least our patient was admitted and treatment started here. There were other smaller hospitals in our area but we had heard they weren’t admitting Covid patients, and that’s why we came here,” said Rakesh Kumar, whose uncle, an unconfirmed Covid-19 case, is undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit of Gangaram.The hospital is planning to start running full strength from July 1. “It takes time; we should be ready in a couple of days. I am asking all my staff to report back to work. There are many disciplines, like surgical departments, which cannot work online. You need to examine patients. You cannot stay at home all your life; we have to get back to normalcy as soon as possible as right now it is affecting the medical services we offer,” said Dr DS Rana, chairman, board of governors, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.Just a stone’s throw away at BLK Hospital, patients in OPDs are also experiencing long waiting hours as the hospital has also been partially converted into a Covid care centre.“The screening process, before you even reach the OPD, is taking a lot more time. I was at the hospital at 9am on Friday and till 2pm my wife wasn’t seen by a doctor. We have been treated in the hospital before; it never took us this long. Why cannot they keep Covid patients at a separate hospital; it is causing huge inconvenience,” complained Roop Singh Guleria, a resident of north west Delhi’s GTB Nagar.The hospital at present is treating 114 Covid-19 patients, as per the Delhi Corona app on Monday.While emergency cases are being addressed, it is the non-emergency cases that have to face long queues.“ICU patients are being taken in quickly. But it is the non-emergency cases that you will find complaining as they have to wait longer. Even though the rush is less, it is getting a bit chaotic,” said Rohtash Kaushik, who had come from Haryana to get his father treated for neck cancer.BLK Hospital did not respond to questions on delayed appointments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/long-wait-for-consultation-at-delhi-s-private-hospitals/story-5Kf71gVRDm4nAp1lkstnOI.html
30-06-2020||Delhi||Deadline for door-to-door survey, screening extended in Delhi||The central government on Monday extended the deadline for the door-to-door health survey in Delhi’s containment zones from June 30 to July 6, which will be followed by a similar door-to-door screening for the rest of the city, a senior official of the Union home ministry said.“Door to door survey will be done first in containment zones on a priority basis by July 6. The date has been extended as the number of containment zones have increased to 435. This will be followed by door to door screening in the entire Delhi,” said a senior official in the home ministry.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageBoth the exercises are part of a set of recommendations by Union home minister Amit Shah who had chaired a Covid-19 review meeting with Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on June 21.The recommendations were notified by the directorate general of health services in Delhi through an order on June 22, which said that the survey in containment zones had to be completed by June 30 and a “comprehensive survey” for the rest of the city had to be completed by July 6.The order, however, did not specify when the two exercises should start nor did it specify a standard operating procedure (SOP) on how the surveys are to be done, which led to confusion among several district officials, said a senior Delhi government official.By Monday, the number of containment zones in the city had also shot up to 435 from 280 till three days ago, under a fresh delineation strategy, which too was part of Shah’s recommendations and notified through the same order.A Delhi government official welcomed the decision to extend the deadlines. “While all 11 revenue districts in the city had started with the survey of containment zones, the officials found it difficult to conduct a parallel survey in the rest of Delhi. There was resource crunch and more than that there was lack of clear directions on how that was to be done. The deadlines too were very tight and looked like an impossible task. The extension of the deadline concerning survey in containment zones and the clarity that the other (applicable to the rest of the city) would start after the first has brought quite some relief,” the senior Delhi government official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/deadline-for-door-to-door-survey-screening-extended/story-Ve8qaeo5eUtM4qAIFzj5gL.html

TISS students, who hail from different parts of the state, went back to their homes after the lockdown was imposed.A spokesperson for the management said that the institute has constituted a committee, and is in the process of conducting a survey to find out issues pertaining to internet accessibility for students.“Not more than one-third of the lectures will be live sessions. We are exploring the possibility of recorded sessions that can be downloaded by students at any time. Texts of the sessions will also be made available to students on email and WhatsApp,” said PK Shajahan, Dean (academics), TISS, Mumbai.While the admission process for new batches is currently underway, the present batch of students have been informed about the start of the academic year. An official statement with details of this process is yet to be released by the institute, said students.“We are not opposing the decision to start virtual classes. But we need clarity on certain loopholes that the institute needs to address. What about students without appropriate infrastructure for live online lectures? The institute also needs to clarify evaluation methodology in advance to prepare students,” said a spokesperson for the Progressive Students’ Forum, a student body at TISS Mumbai.In several posts on social media, students have demanded that the institute also share the results of their student survey and reveal how many students have dependable access to internet in order to make virtual classes viable, said students.While details of the survey are still ‘n progress’, the institute said lectures for the present batches will commence on July 27 and for new batches from August 10 .“We are still conducting online interviews for admissions to new batches across all four campuses, and these new batches will join only August onwards,” added Shajahan.TISS has already completed over 4,000 online interviews for 1,457 masters course seats across the Hyderabad, Tuljapur and Guwahati campuses. For the Mumbai campus, online admission interviews will be conducted in mid-July, said Shajahan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tiss-to-commence-new-academic-year-in-virtual-mode-from-july-27/story-hhOXezXgVDR2boxGn6kZMI.html

30-06-2020||World||Growing bipartisan support among US lawmakers for India in conflict with China||Bipartisan support for India in its military standoff with China in Ladakh has been growing among US lawmakers. Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republican-ruled US senate, kicked off floor debate on next year’s defense budget Monday by slamming China for “picking deadly fights” with India.McConnell appealed for the chamber’s bipartisan support to pass the National Defense Authorization Act 2021with remarks highlighting recent threats from adversarial nationals China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.“China has resumed its submarine intrusions into Japanese contiguous zones and picked deadly fights with India at high altitude,” McConnell said.In a floor speech on June 18, just days after the deadly slash in which 20 Indian soldiers had died, Leader McConnell had said the Chinese military had appeared to have “instigated the worst violent clash between China and India since those nations went to war way back in 1962.”Also on Monday, another Republican senator, Marco Rubio, came out in India’s support. “Today I spoke to @SandhuTaranjitS to express our solidarity with the people of #India as they firmly confront unwarranted & lawless armed aggression by the Communist Party of #China.” He was referring to a conversation with Taranjit S Sandhu, the Indian ambassador to the United States.“India has made it clear, they will not be bullied by Beijing.,” the senator added. He is a member of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, a powerful congressional panel with oversight of the State Department and the country’s foreign policy.The State Department, it must be noted, has also been clear it holds Chinese aggression responsible for the borer clashes, and denounced in a statement echoed later by the White House. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has referred to the clashes several times. “The PLA has escalated border tensions – we see it today in India, the world’s most popular – populous democracy,” he said on June 18. He had also conveyed his condolences on the death of the Indian soldiers.President Trump had offered to mediate May end, but was turned down by both countries.In a TV interview past Sunday, Tom Cotton, a Republican senator who is a close ally of President Donald Trump, denounced China’s aggression on the border with India to illustrate the growing threat the Asian giant poses to the United States and its allies and partners around the world. “The Chinese Communist Party is certainly using the pandemic to try to assert claims and take very aggressive action against almost all of its neighbors,” Cotton said, adding, “high up in the Himalayas, China has essentially invaded India, an ally of ours. And they have killed 20 Indian soldiers.”The senator went on to draw attention to a proposed law that “violates” China’s international commitment regarding Hong Kong — the new national security law — and its aggression against Taiwan and the rim nations of the South China Sea, Vietnam, Philippines and Malaysia.“China is becoming more aggressive than ever. That’s why it’s so important that we support all of our allies and partners,” he added.There has been bipartisan support for India in this conflict. The Democratic-led House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, Eliot Engel, had denounced Chinese aggression early June, before the June 15 clashes in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. “I am extremely concerned by the ongoing Chinese aggression along the Line of Actual Control on the India-China border.,” Engel had said in a statement. “China is demonstrating once again that it is willing to bully its neighbors rather than resolve conflicts according to international law.”“I am concerned by continued Chinese aggression along its border with India,” Ami Bera, the Indian-descent chair of the Asia subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, had written in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/growing-bipartisan-support-among-us-lawmakers-for-india-in-conflict-with-china/story-3jyiJHNO8VAPXZKWUuCraI.html
30-06-2020||World||UK says only matter of time before Huawei exits 5G network||Huawei Technologies Co. will not be part of the U.K.’s 5G telecoms networks in the long term, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told Parliament, adding that he welcomes approaches from alternative vendors including South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. and Japan’s NEC Corp.Questioned by Parliament’s Defence Committee on Tuesday, Dowden conceded that “ultimately” Huawei equipment wouldn’t be used. “But there is a big difference as to the path to getting to that point,” he said.Boris Johnson’s government announced in January that Huawei would be allowed to supply equipment for the U.K.’s 5G networks. At the time, officials argued that bans on Huawei’s use in sensitive geographic areas and “core” technical components would sufficiently mitigate any risks, while still allowing Britain to take advantage of the new technologies it will enable.The decision to allow the Chinese company into the networks outraged not just U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration but also Members of Parliament in Johnson’s own Conservative Party.Also read | FCC designates China’s Huawei, ZTE as national security threatsChina’s behavior since then over both coronavirus and Hong Kong has done nothing to allay those concerns, meaning Johnson faces defeat in Parliament if he tries to push the decision through. The U.S. has also imposed sanctions “designed to make 5G designed by Huawei very hard to do,” Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, sitting alongside Dowden, told the committee. Shortly after the two men finished giving evidence in London, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission designated Huawei and ZTE Corp as national security threats.The U.S. sanctions, introduced in May, put Huawei’s microchip supply in jeopardy. They’re “likely to have an impact on the viability of Huawei as a provider for the 5G network,” Dowden said, but he wouldn’t comment on potential changes to the company’s legal status. He also wouldn’t commit to a deadline for removing Huawei.But he did say the government is considering trade and financial incentives for rivals, which could bolster a push to diversify the U.K. supply chain away from its reliance on Huawei and its Nordic rivals Nokia Oyj and Ericsson AB. Officials are holding “constructive” talks with potential new market entrants, he said.“Both Samsung and NEC are obvious vendors that we would like to get into the U.K. market” and officials are examining ways to cut costs for new entrants, Dowden said. “We’re looking at things such as trade incentives for incoming vendors, financial incentives. We’re looking at all those ways of trying to ease a pathway in for them.”The caps on Huawei introduced in January will already cost about 1.5 billion pounds ($1.9 billion) to implement and entail a year-long delay to network deployment, and stricter rules would mean further costs, Dowden said.The National Cyber Security Centre has now reviewed the likely impact of those U.S. sanctions, paving the way for a decision on the future role for the Chinese company from the National Security Council, chaired by Johnson. Ministers and officials are now considering their next steps.“No decisions have been made,” Dowden said. “If national security requires it, we won’t hesitate in applying restrictions which will impose higher costs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-says-only-matter-of-time-before-huawei-exits-5g-network/story-nHYOZQAsJ8qTglFI7ZhVaL.html

30-06-2020||World||How Eva, a $1.8 million portrait, became a symbol of protest||Arms folded and her lips sardonically askew, Eva makes an unlikely icon for the protest movement that’s shaking Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko ahead of presidential elections. For starters, “she” is an almost century-old oil painting.Yet the portrait by the Jewish expressionist painter Chaim Soutine has swirled into the eye of a political storm. The banker responsible for buying it in 2013 -- for a cool $1.8 million at auction in New York -- is running for president from jail to try to end Lukashenko’s 26-year rule.As chief executive of Belgazprombank, the Belarusian lender owned by Russia’s natural gas giant Gazprom PJSC and Gazprombank JSC, Viktor Babariko spent a decade hunting for paintings by Belarus-born artists to bring home and display to the public. He resigned from the bank in May to announce his candidacy for the Aug. 9 elections and was detained on June 18 amid a state security service probe into tax evasion and money laundering.Shortly before his arrest, the authorities also seized the $20 million art collection built up by Babariko at the bank’s gallery in the capital, Minsk. When protests erupted, social media exploded with Eva’s image and more and more people began to wear it on T-shirts.Lukashenko has routinely crushed public dissent since winning power in 1994 and he retains an iron grip on the former Soviet republic’s institutions and security services. While defeat at the polls is all but inconceivable as he seeks a sixth presidential term, he’s facing unusually robust opposition this time that prompted him to complain last week of a “foreign” plot to foment revolution.On Monday, state-owned media cited the five-time president’s warning of the dangers surrounding the country and by implication the risks involved in handing power to less experienced hands.“If we take just one incautious step, we will collapse under the rubble of disagreements, conflicts and empires,” Lukashenko told officials at a televised meeting in Soligorsk, 80 miles south of the capital Minsk, according to the Belta news agency.Geopolitical StruggleThere’s a growing perception within Belarus that something significant has changed in the nation of 9.4 million bordering Russia, Ukraine and the European Union that’s long been known for its political docility. Strategically located between Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization states of Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, Belarus risks becoming the latest focus of a geopolitical struggle between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the West.Previous dips in Lukashenko’s popularity never coincided “with elections, economic recession, a coronavirus pandemic and lack of money to appease angry voters who are rapidly becoming politically active,” says Artyom Shraibman, founder of Minsk-based political consultancy Sense Analytics. He added that the government was doing all it could to suppress the current wave of discontent before August.The belief, long held even among many opponents, that Lukashenko would win free and fair elections if he ever let them be held is no longer taken as a given. Protest slogans declare “3%” or “We Are The 97%” after -- highly self-selecting -- online surveys found minimal popular support for the president. Confronting a group of opposition protesters in person recently, Lukashenko asked them to stop using the “3%” figure, suggesting they must know it to be false.Another presumption now questioned is that Belarusians would never go into the streets to topple a leader in the way that other ex-Soviet nations -– from Armenia to Ukraine -– have done since gaining independence in 1991.Actress Yulia Shevchuk says that she’d finally had enough when she saw Eva and the other paintings had been replaced by posters with QR codes on the walls of Belgazprombank’s gallery. She Googled Soutine’s portrait and doctored it with a painting app to post on Facebook. Eva was now showing her middle finger.“It was so hard for me to see all this lawlessness, so painful to see the people and the country being appropriated by a single person,” says Shevchuk. Eva’s picture, tweaked by other Belarus netizens to show her looking from behind bars, dressed in prison uniform or led away by the security services (the main branch is still called KGB) began to pop up everywhere.Lukashenko hinted after Babariko’s arrest that unfriendly circles in Russia were behind his candidacy. The claim’s impact was undermined by the fact that arresting the president’s opponents has become routine ahead of elections in Belarus, even if in the past they were alleged to have been in cahoots with Western powers, rather than Russia.“Someone thinks that Belarusians are his serfs, who can be pushed around,” Babariko said in a video statement before he was arrested together with his son, who was helping to run his campaign. He denies any ties to Moscow.In another change, this time it isn’t just the usual suspects in the urban middle classes who appear fed up with their president.Lukashenko’s other main election challenge comes from a blogger named Sergei Tikhonovskiy, who calls Lukashenko a cockroach -- an insect best known locally for the Soviet-era children’s poem in which it terrorizes an animal kingdom. Tikhonovskiy took to touring small-town Belarus communities that are traditionally loyal to the president with a giant bug-killing slipper on his car roof.He was jailed before he could even officially register his election campaign team. His wife Svetlana now aims to register and run for office on his behalf. She posted an emotional video address on June 16 alleging threats were made against her children unless she pulled out of the race.Lukashenko has been fighting fires for some time. First came a dispute with Russia last year which demanded he agree to a closer political union in return for economic support, including discounted oil and gas. For more than a quarter-century, those de facto subsidies allowed him to avoid the kinds of wrenching post-Soviet economic reforms that contributed to political upheaval elsewhere.The two countries are again arguing over a natural-gas price and Russia effectively halted oil deliveries in January, prompting Belarus to look for alternative supplies as far away as the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and Norway.Belarus had made a profitable industry out of processing cheap Russian crude for export at world market prices, but proceeds from sales of petroleum products plunged by 62% in the first four months of 2020 amid slumping oil demand. With the economy in recession, Lukashenko this month swapped his banker prime minister for a weapons chief, heralding military-style mobilization for an economy that faces multiple challenges.Vodka, SaunasLukashenko’s approach to the coronavirus outbreak was the final straw for some. Belarus never declared a lockdown and people were left to choose whether to wear masks, self-isolate or live their lives as usual. The president consistently downplayed the risks, at one point advocating vodka and saunas to combat the disease, and he insisted on holding a May 9 military parade to mark the end of World War II even as Russia postponed its own event.Babariko has campaigned on the economy, warning that Belarus has grown so reliant on foreign support it may soon lose its independence. He has also floated the possibility of seeking military neutrality for a country that’s currently part of a defense alliance with Russia, the Collective Security Treaty Organization. He pledges to revitalize the state-owned sector, support private business and restore the balance of power between branches of government.In a nation anxious to avoid the kind of hostilities with Moscow seen across the border in Ukraine, Lukashenko’s portrayals of Babariko as a puppet for outside forces seem to have had little impact. Belarus has no reliable public opinion polls, so the true extent of a candidate’s support is hard to measure. Yet Babariko quickly collected 435,000 signatures to register his candidacy, more than four times the number required.Lukashenko himself has always stressed Russia’s position as a strategic ally even at times of strain. He joined Putin in Moscow to watch Russia’s delayed WWII parade on June 24, but on returning promptly accused Russia of meddling in his country’s elections, a charge the Kremlin denied.With Babariko himself cut off from the world and unable to campaign, his team have called on Belarusians to show support for him and other detainees by writing letters to them in prison. The call, issued on Instagram, was illustrated with a postcard of Eva.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-eva-a-1-8-million-portrait-became-a-symbol-of-protest/story-7mR8ESiahhQj7AO0ps2hXI.html

Thirty-six of the 141 had either retired or moved out, it said. Air Blue said seven of the pilots on the list no longer worked for the airline.The pilots and their union have rejected the list and demanded a judicial investigation. “We don’t have full details of the discrepancies with us,” said Abdul Sattar Khokhar, a spokesman at Pakistan’s civil aviation ministry. “The issue is being sorted out in consultation with airlines and civil aviation authorities.” The Pakistan Airlines Pilots Association (PALPA) has also raised doubts about the list. “It contains names of highly educated and qualified pilots who have passed all the tests,” its president, Chaudhry Salman, told Reuters. “We want a fair and impartial resolution to this matter.” The action on the “dubious” licences was prompted by the preliminary report on an airliner crash in Karachi that killed 97 people last month. It found the plane’s pilots failed to follow standard procedures and disregarded alarms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-pilots-question-government-list-of-262-pilots-call-it-dubious/story-L9uWMuItfdmPMH0bneD2OM.html

But the airline had hoped to resume its flights to Oslo, Copenhagen, Paris, Barcelona and Milan within the next two months.“It is hurting us really bad,” he said of the pilots scandal.An inquiry into a May 22 PIA crash that killed 97 people at the southern port city of Karachi resulted in the stunning revelation that 260 of 860 pilots in Pakistan had cheated on their pilots exams but were still given licences by the Civil Aviation Authority.The government has since fired four officials of the regulatory agency and criminal charges are being considered.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency “is concerned about the validity of the Pakistani pilot licenses and that Pakistan, as the State of operator, is currently not capable to certify and oversee its operators and aircraft in accordance with applicable international standards,” the organization said in its letter announcing the ban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ban-on-pakistan-international-airline-from-flying-to-europe-for-6-months-over-pilots-exam-controversy/story-wObgxyfoxjqG8cvlLNi5RO.html
30-06-2020||World||Donald Trump’s H1-B visa suspension leaves many US workers stuck in India||Natasha Bhat learned in late February that her father-in-law had suddenly died. Bhat, 35, recently recalled how she grabbed a backpack and hustled her US -born 4-year-old son to the San Francisco airport to catch a midnight flight to India, her home country. She didn’t anticipate being stuck there indefinitely. Bhat works at a tech company in Silicon Valley on an H-1B visa, and her documents were due for renewal. So she threw them in the bag, knowing she’d have to get the chore taken care of before flying back to the US in a few weeks. But she said her mid-March appointment at the US consulate in Kolkata was canceled when it shut down due to Covid-19 concerns. Her return home was delayed further when President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week barring many people on several types of visas, including H-1Bs, from entering the country until 2021.Trump’s executive order is the latest step in his years-long tightening of US immigration policy. The president has argued since taking office the visa programs allow employers to undercut native-born workers on wages, over the objections of companies that say they need highly skilled workers to fill crucial job openings. The latest restrictions, said Greg Siskind, an immigration lawyer in Memphis, “use the pandemic as an excuse to achieve anti-immigration goals the administration has wanted to do for years.”H-1B holders, about three-quarters of whom work in the tech sector, have felt a creeping sense of unease since Trump took office. Still, thousands of them continued to fly back and forth between the US and their home countries, for weddings or funerals—or for work assignments or to get mundane paperwork taken care of. (Some visas require people to leave the country briefly after approval to get their passports stamped.) Many of those who left the US this spring, as Bhat did, found the world as they knew it changed mid-trip.About 375,000 temporary visaholders and green card applicants will now be banned from entering the US until next year, according to Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group. A significant number of those are now stuck in India, which has long had a close connection to Silicon Valley. The technology industry has consistently objected to the administration’s immigration restrictions, and Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Twitter Inc. immediately condemned the latest executive order, along with trade groups representing hundreds of other technology firms. The objections haven’t spared people like Bhat and her husband, who have worked in Silicon Valley for the last nine years, she as a manager for a software firm and he as an engineer at a bank. Her husband flew back to the US in early March for work and has spent the past four months of lockdown alone. Bhat is now working overnight to support her US based clients, and trying to convince their son Adhrit to eat Indian food like chapati for breakfast over his complaints that he misses his standard Californian breakfast of avocado toast.The prospect of a wave of people stranded abroad began worrying Siskind several weeks ago when he first caught wind of the planned order. On Twitter, he warned workers on non-immigrant visas not to leave the US. He urged those abroad to come back as soon as possible.Once the order took effect, Siskind set up an online form for people to share their stories, and asked his followers on social media to fill it out. Within 24 hours, he had over 500 responses. There was the scientist researching coronavirus-testing products who flew to India to get married, the Atlanta-based IT consultant who may miss the birth of his child, the 2-year-old girl who was born in the US and has developed severe allergic skin reactions to mosquito bites in India, the Intel Corp. employee who is now running critical projects from afar.Siskind fielded calls from husbands separated from wives, parents from children. People told him they were worried about keeping up with mortgage payments on houses, car loans and jobs. Some had US-born children who are American citizens enrolled in US schools. Many have valid visas and assumed all they would need to get back in the country was a routine stamp in their passport.Narendra Singh, an Indian-born software architect who has lived in Dallas for nine years, took his family back to Kolkata, India, in February. Their return was delayed when the consulates closed and they were advised to wait out the worst of the pandemic. Now Singh is working remotely. His wife, a software engineer, lost her job in April. Their daughter, a US citizen, was slated to start preschool in the fall, but they’ve been preparing her for the possibility that won’t happen. Singh, 36, said he knew there was always a chance of his visa not being extended, but assumed he was secure until his current visa was set to expire in 2022. “We took specialized jobs, we followed the rules, we got the visas,” he said. “I just feel betrayed.”Mili Widhani Khatter, 39, who has lived in the US with her husband and two US-born children for the past 12 years, flew back to Delhi, India, without her family to say goodbye to her dying mother. She hasn’t seen her children in nearly four months, and said her 2-year-old son has forgotten how to say “mama” since they’ve been apart. “This is the worst punishment you can give to a mom,” Khatter said. “It’s not humane.”Now families worry what another six months of uncertainty will do to their kids—and to the futures they thought they were charting. “I have a valid visa. I’ve been living in the Bay Area for eight years. I have a life there and a home there, and my husband is there,” Bhat said. “Will I ever be able to go back?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-h1-b-visa-suspension-leaves-many-us-workers-stuck-in-india/story-k2yaCAHxf5ZtRHGkGRz2BJ.html
30-06-2020||World||European Union reopens borders to 14 nations; US, Indian tourists among those barred||The European Union announced Tuesday that it will reopen its borders to travelers from 14 countries, but most Americans have been refused entry for at least another two weeks due to soaring coronavirus infections in the USTravelers from other big countries like Russia, Brazil and India will also miss out.As Europe’s economies reel from the impact of the coronavirus, southern EU countries like Greece, Italy and Spain are desperate to entice back sun-loving visitors and breathe life into their damaged tourism industries.More than 15 million Americans are estimated to travel to Europe each year, while some 10 million Europeans head across the Atlantic.Citizens from the following countries will be allowed into the EU’s 27 members and four other nations in Europe’s visa-free Schengen travel zone: Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay.The EU said China is “subject to confirmation of reciprocity,” meaning it must lift all restrictions on European citizens entering China before it will allow Chinese citizens back in.Countries considered for the safe list are also expected to lift any bans they might have in place on European travelers. The list is to be updated every 14 days, with new countries being added and some even dropping off depending on whether they are keeping the disease under control.Still, many people both inside and outside Europe remain wary of travel in the coronavirus era, given the unpredictability of the pandemic and the possibility of second waves of infection that could affect flights and hotel bookings. Tens of thousands of travelers had a frantic, chaotic scramble in March to get home as the pandemic swept across the world and borders slammed shut.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States has surged over the past week, and President Donald Trump also suspended the entry of all people from Europe’s ID check-free travel zone in a decree in March.In contrast, aside from a notable recent outbreak tied to a slaughterhouse in western Germany, the virus’s spread has generally stabilized across much of continental Europe.European Union countries hastily slapped restrictions on who could cross their borders in February as the virus spread in Italy. Then in mid-March the Europeans limited all non-essential travel to the 27 EU member states plus Liechtenstein, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland..Non-EU citizens who are already living in Europe are not included in the ban.The EU list does not apply to travel to Britain, which left the EU in January. Britain now requires all incoming travelers — bar a few exceptions like truck drivers — to go into a self-imposed 14-day quarantine, although the measure is under review and is likely to ease in the coming weeks. The requirement also applies to U.K. citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-reopens-borders-to-14-nations-us-indian-tourists-among-those-barred/story-uXse3NjNAIeGAyiEKzQDcM.html

Official news agency Xinhua said Chinese lawmakers had voted to adopt the law and decided the “national security law would be included” in Hong Kong’s mini constitution known as the Basic Law.Hong Kong’s pro-democracy activists could potentially face prison terms if found guilty under the new law.Beijing says the law will be enforced to tackle separatism and foreign interference but critics say it will outlaw dissent and curb the various freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong’s citizens under the “one country, two systems” mechanism under which it has been governed since 1997.It will come into effect on Wednesday, July 1, the anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover to China from the British.Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong announced he is stepping down as leader of his pro-democracy group Demosisto, soon after Beijing had passed the controversial national security law.“After much internal deliberation, we have decided to disband and cease all operations as a group given the circumstances,” Demosisto said on Twitter.Wong, 23, had previously said he would be a “prime target” of the law.“We hope the law will serve as a deterrent to prevent people from stirring up trouble,” Tam Yiu-Chung, Hong Kong’s only representative on the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, China’s rubber-stamp Parliament, which approved the law on Tuesday morning.“Don’t let Hong Kong be used as a tool to split the country,” he said.“The national security law that targets a tiny minority of people who commit acts of secession, subversion and terrorism, and aims to protect the legitimate rights of the vast majority including law-biding citizens and companies, could not be better to safeguard Hong Kong’s stability and development in the long run,” Xinhua said in a commentary on Tuesday.“In fact, Beijing is trying to protect the interests of foreign investors in Hong Kong, including those of American businesses. The turbulence since last June has seriously eroded the city’s security and harmed its sound and stable business environment,” the report added.In Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry said it will take necessary countermeasures to “firmly safeguard” its national interests in response to the US’s decision to end special treatment for Hong Kong over the new law.Spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a daily ministry briefing said “the so-called sanctions” by the US side cannot stop China’s determination to promote the law on safeguarding national security in the city.Zhao said that establishing national security law to safeguard the country’s national security is a representation of the “one country, two systems” principle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-president-xi-jinping-signs-bill-that-could-mean-jail-for-dissent-in-hong-kong/story-Pbk8ZenT3cPb3UWVXIx99O.html
30-06-2020||World||‘Will take measures to prevent any virus outbreak’: China on new influenza variant G4||China on Tuesday said it will “take all necessary measures to prevent the outbreak of any virus” following a new study that has revealed a variant of swine flu capable of triggering a pandemic.The new influenza variant has been named G4 and is genetically linked and descended from the H1N1 strain that caused a pandemic that killed thousands in 2009.It possesses “all the essential hallmarks of being highly adapted to infect humans,” say the authors who are scientists at Chinese universities and at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) on Monday.“The virus is a unique blend of three lineages: one similar to strains found in European and Asian birds, the H1N1 strain that caused the 2009 pandemic, and a North American H1N1 that has genes from avian, human, and pig influenza viruses,” the American Association for the Advances of Sciences (AAAS) said in a report on the findings.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian, when asked to comment on the study at Tuesday’s press conference said China was closely following developments.“We will take all necessary measures to prevent the spread and outbreak of any virus,” he said. The WHO will read the Chinese study carefully, spokesperson Christian Lindmeier told a Geneva briefing on Tuesday, saying it was important to collaborate on findings and keep tabs on animal populations.“It also highlights we cannot let our guard down on influenza and need to be vigilant and continue surveillance even in the coronavirus pandemic,” he added.A team led by Liu Jinhua from the China Agricultural University (CAU) analysed nearly 30,000 nasal swabs taken from pigs at slaughterhouses in 10 Chinese provinces, and another 1,000 swabs from pigs with respiratory symptoms seen at their school’s veterinary teaching hospital between 2011 and 2018.The swabs yielded 179 swine influenza viruses, the vast majority of which were G4 or one of five other G strains from the Eurasian avian like lineage.“G4 virus has shown a sharp increase since 2016 and is the predominant genotype in circulation in pigs detected across at least 10 provinces,” the researchers wrote.Sun Honglei, the paper’s first author, says G4’s inclusion of genes from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic “may promote the virus adaptation” that leads to human-to-human transmission.Therefore, “It’s necessary to strengthen the surveillance” of Chinese pigs for influenza viruses, says Sun, who is also at CAU.“It is of concern that human infection of G4 virus will further human adaptation and increase the risk of a human pandemic,” the researchers wrote. Estimates say at least 40 percent of China’s pig population was decimated last year because of the spread of a separate viral disease, the deadly African swine fever, driving up pork prices and badly damaging business.More than 10.3 million people have been infected and over 500,000 killed in the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-take-measures-to-prevent-any-virus-outbreak-china-on-new-influenza-variant-g4/story-GzEGL1XdQ4r9GxVVfCjFEI.html
30-06-2020||World||Deeply concerned at China passing Hong Kong law: UK PM Boris Johnson||Reiterating “deep concern” over China passing a security law applicable to Hong Kong, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said its text will now be scrutinised, recalling his earlier decision to offer a path to citizenship to residents of the former British colony.Johnson’s remarks following reports from Beijing that the law had been passed revived concerns about the UK allowing the Chinese company Huawei in its forthcoming 5G infrastructure. There is growing opposition to the company after the US banned it.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Johnson have previously committed to offering nearly 2 million holders in Hong Kong of British Nationals (Overseas) status a path to full British citizenship if Beijing passed and implemented the law.According to the British perspective, the new law goes against guarantees in the Sino-British agreements before the 1997 handover that political and other freedoms of the citizens will be preserved for 50 years.Johnson said: “I am deeply concerned at the law being passed. We will be looking at it carefully and scrutinise it if it is in conflict with the declaration with China. We have a duty to BNOs in Hong Kong as I said earlier”.On the UK keeping Huawei away from the 5G infrastructure as part of its response to the law, he added: “I am not a Sinophone, I won’t be drawn into Sinophobia, but we need to strike a balance to protect critical infrastructure from hostile vendors”.Raab previously announced the path to British citizenship in a statement to the House of Commons: “The House will recall that BNO status was conferred on British Dependent Territories Citizens connected with Hong Kong as part of the package of arrangements that accompanied the Joint Declaration in 1984, in preparation for the handover of the territory”.“And under that status, currently, BNO passport holders are already entitled to UK consular assistance in third countries. And the British government also provides people with BNO passports visa-free entry into the UK for up to six months as visitors”.“If China follows through with its proposed legislation, we will put in place new arrangements to allow BNOs to come to the UK without the current 6 month limit, enabling them to live and apply to study and work for extendable periods of 12 months, thereby also providing a pathway to citizenship”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deeply-concerned-at-china-passing-hong-kong-law-uk-pm-boris-johnson/story-k4n63XU11G04ryhf4Nnu7K.html
30-06-2020||World||PM Boris Johnson stays upbeat as UK’s ‘Little India’ is in new lockdown||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday announced a £5 billion-economic package to recover from what he called the ‘disaster’ of the cornavirus pandemic, as the east Midlands town of Leicester with a large population of Indian origin went into the UK’s first local lockdown.Harping on the mantra of ‘Build, build, build’, Johnson drew comparisons with former US President Franklin D Roosvelt’s ‘New Deal’ that took the country out of depression in the 1930s, and set out plans for major capital investment while keeping an eye on the virus.England is due to ease lockdown restrictions on Saturday, but Leicester will be excluded due to an increase in infections in recent days and weeks, particularly among the younger population. The infections are particularly high in areas of pre-existing economic deprivation, such an Evington.Considered the UK’s poster town of multiculturalism for its record in assimilating migrants of Indian heritage from Uganda and other places over the decades, the town has been placed out of bounds for anyone visiting, leaving or travelling within its limits.Delivering a speech in Dudley, about 90 km from Leicester, Johnson said: “Too many parts of this country have felt left behind, neglected, unloved, as though someone had taken a strategic decision that their fate did not matter as much as the metropolis”.“It (economic package) sounds positively Rooseveltian. It sounds like a New Deal. All I can say is that if so, then that is how it is meant to sound and to be, because that is what the times demand”, he added.Critics panned Johnson comparing the economic package with the much bigger ‘New Deal’ of Roosvelt, with some pointing out that some elements had already been announced and were being brought forward. The plans also include promises made to usually Labour-voting areas that voted for the Conservatives in the December 2019 election.The announcement includes building new homes, schools, more funding for the National Health Service, tackling skills crisis and bridging gaps in connectivity, productivity and opportunity. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to announce details of the package shortly.Johnson said: “If we deliver this plan together, then we will together build our way back to health. We will not just bounce back, we will bounce forward – stronger and better and more united than ever before”.“To that end we will build build build. Build back better, build back greener, build back faster and to do that at the pace that this moment requires”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-boris-johnson-stays-upbeat-as-uk-s-little-india-is-in-new-lockdown/story-GfEXdNuyDTYx9zacgUKQgJ.html

China was the focus of an extended debate in the House of Commons based on a new report by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China that said there is new evidence suggesting that China is pursuing a birth-prevention programme targeted at Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region.Iain Duncan-Smith, former Conservative leader, who tabled the urgent question, said it cannot be “business as usual” with China given what he called “bullying behavior” in relation to India, Hong Kong and elsewhere.Citing figures from the report of falling birth rates among the minorities in Xinjiang, he said: “Of course the world wants to deal with China, but we cannot continue with business as usual while this sort of blatant activity continues”.He added: “(Given) the Chinese Government’s appalling record on human rights, their attack on freedoms in Hong Kong, their bullying behaviour in border disputes from the South China seas to India, their blatant breaching of the rules-based order governing the free market and their delayed declaration on Covid-19, will the Government now initiate an internal review of the UK’s dependence on China, with a view to significantly reducing that dependence, and call on the free world to come together to ensure that this growing threat from China is dealt with together before, as history teaches us, it is too late?”Nigel Adams, minister for Asia, responded that the Boris Johnson government had raised concerns with China at many levels. Britain was pressing China for access to Xinjiang; the last time British diplomats visited the region was in November 2019.He said: “Our approach to China remains clear-eyed and is rooted in our values and interests. It has always been the case that when we have concerns we raise them, and that where we need to intervene we will”.“We have consistently led international efforts to highlight concern about the worsening human rights situation in Xinjiang, and I assure my right hon. Friend that the United Kingdom will continue to do so”.Labour’s Stephen Kinnock wanted the Johnson government to recognise that the actions of the Chinese authorities in Xinjiang “reflect a wider pattern of behaviour of increasingly authoritarian policies at home and aggressive expansionism abroad, including in Hong Kong, Ladakh and the South China sea”.Calling upon China to allow the office of the UN high commissioner for human rights unfettered access to the region, Adams reiterated that London had “concerns about the detention and human rights abuses, with more than a million Uyghur Muslims and other minorities detained in political re-education camps”.The Johnson government has recently strongly criticised Beijing for enacting a security law applicable to the former British colony of Hong Kong that, according to the British perspective, goes against international law and agreements signed before the 1997 handover to China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-mps-cite-india-china-clash-demand-review-of-dependence/story-jXbFac3LiAzv1uk42Ss6MM.html
30-06-2020||World||‘Demographic genocide’: China cuts Uighur births with IUDs, abortion, sterilisation||The Chinese government is taking draconian measures to slash birth rates among Uighurs and other minorities as part of a sweeping campaign to curb its Muslim population, even as it encourages some of the country’s Han majority to have more children.While individual women have spoken out before about forced birth control, the practice is far more widespread and systematic than previously known, according to an AP investigation based on government statistics, state documents and interviews with 30 ex-detainees, family members and a former detention camp instructor. The campaign over the past four years in the far west region of Xinjiang is leading to what some experts are calling a form of “demographic genocide.”The state regularly subjects minority women to pregnancy checks, and forces intrauterine devices, sterilization and even abortion on hundreds of thousands, the interviews and data show. Even while the use of IUDs and sterilization has fallen nationwide, it is rising sharply in Xinjiang.The population control measures are backed by mass detention both as a threat and as a punishment for failure to comply. Having too many children is a major reason people are sent to detention camps, the AP found, with the parents of three or more ripped away from their families unless they can pay huge fines. Police raid homes, terrifying parents as they search for hidden children.After Gulnar Omirzakh, a Chinese-born Kazakh, had her third child, the government ordered her to get an IUD inserted. Two years later, in January 2018, four officials in military camouflage came knocking at her door anyway. They gave Omirzakh, the penniless wife of a detained vegetable trader, three days to pay a $2,685 fine for having more than two children.If she didn’t, they warned, she would join her husband and a million other ethnic minorities locked up in internment camps — often for having too many children.“God bequeaths children on you. To prevent people from having children is wrong,” said Omirzakh, who tears up even now thinking back to that day. “They want to destroy us as a people.”The result of the birth control campaign is a climate of terror around having children, as seen in interview after interview. Birth rates in the mostly Uighur regions of Hotan and Kashgar plunged by more than 60% from 2015 to 2018, the latest year available in government statistics. Across the Xinjiang region, birth rates continue to plummet, falling nearly 24% last year alone — compared to just 4.2% nationwide, statistics show.The hundreds of millions of dollars the government pours into birth control has transformed Xinjiang from one of China’s fastest-growing regions to among its slowest in just a few years, according to new research obtained by The Associated Press in advance of publication by China scholar Adrian Zenz.“This kind of drop is unprecedented....there’s a ruthlessness to it,” said Zenz, a leading expert in the policing of China’s minority regions. “This is part of a wider control campaign to subjugate the Uighurs.”U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo denounced the policies in a statement Monday.“We call on the Chinese Communist Party to immediately end these horrific practices,” he said.China’s foreign minister derided the story as “fabricated” and “fake news,” saying the government treats all ethnicities equally and protects the legal rights of minorities.“Everyone, regardless of whether they’re an ethnic minority or Han Chinese, must follow and act in accordance with the law,” ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Monday when asked about the AP story.Chinese officials have said in the past that the new measures are merely meant to be fair, allowing both Han Chinese and ethnic minorities the same number of children.For decades, China had one of the most extensive systems of minority entitlements in the world, with Uighurs and others getting more points on college entrance exams, hiring quotas for government posts and laxer birth control restrictions. Under China’s now-abandoned ‘one child’ policy, the authorities had long encouraged, often forced, contraceptives, sterilization and abortion on Han Chinese. But minorities were allowed two children — three if they came from the countryside.Also read | China warns of countermeasures in response to US Uighurs lawUnder President Xi Jinping, China’s most authoritarian leader in decades, those benefits are now being rolled back. In 2014, soon after Xi visited Xinjiang, the region’s top official said it was time to implement “equal family planning policies” for all ethnicities and “reduce and stabilize birth rates.” In the following years, the government declared that instead of just one child, Han Chinese could now have two, and three in Xinjiang’s rural areas, just like minorities.But while equal on paper, in practice Han Chinese are largely spared the abortions, sterilizations, IUD insertions and detentions for having too many children that are forced on Xinjiang’s other ethnicities, interviews and data show. Some rural Muslims, like Omirzakh, are punished even for having the three children allowed by the law.State-backed scholars have warned for years that large rural religious families were at the root of bombings, knifings and other attacks the Xinjiang government blamed on Islamic terrorists. The growing Muslim population was a breeding ground for poverty and extremism which could “heighten political risk,” according to a 2017 paper by the head of the Institute of Sociology at the Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences. Another cited as a key obstacle the religious belief that “the fetus is a gift from God.”Outside experts say the birth control campaign is part of a state-orchestrated assault on the Uighurs to purge them of their faith and identity and forcibly assimilate them. They’re subjected to political and religious re-education in camps and forced labor in factories, while their children are indoctrinated in orphanages. Uighurs, who are often but not always Muslim, are also tracked by a vast digital surveillance apparatus.“The intention may not be to fully eliminate the Uighur population, but it will sharply diminish their vitality,” said Darren Byler, an expert on Uighurs at the University of Colorado. “It will make them easier to assimilate into the mainstream Chinese population.”Some go a step further.“It’s genocide, full stop. It’s not immediate, shocking, mass-killing on the spot type genocide, but it’s slow, painful, creeping genocide,” said Joanne Smith Finley, who works at Newcastle University in the U.K. “These are direct means of genetically reducing the Uighur population.”For centuries, the majority was Muslim in the arid, landlocked region China now calls “Xinjiang” — meaning “New Frontier” in Mandarin.After the People’s Liberation Army swept through in 1949, China’s new Communist rulers ordered thousands of soldiers to settle in Xinjiang, pushing the Han population from 6.7% that year to more than 40% by 1980. The move sowed anxiety about Chinese migration that persists to this day. Drastic efforts to restrict birth rates in the 1990s were relaxed after major pushback, with many parents paying bribes or registering children as the offspring of friends or other family members.That all changed with an unprecedented crackdown starting in 2017, throwing hundreds of thousands of people into prisons and camps for alleged “signs of religious extremism” such as traveling abroad, praying or using foreign social media. Authorities launched what several notices called “dragnet-style” investigations to root out parents with too many children, even those who gave birth decades ago.“Leave no blind spots,” said two county and township directives in 2018 and 2019 uncovered by Zenz, who is also an independent contractor with the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, a bipartisan nonprofit based in Washington, D.C. “Contain illegal births and lower fertility levels,” said a third.Officials and armed police began pounding on doors, looking for kids and pregnant women. Minority residents were ordered to attend weekly flag-raising ceremonies, where officials threatened detention if they didn’t register all their children, according to interviews backed by attendance slips and booklets. Notices found by the AP show that local governments set up or expanded systems to reward those who report illegal births.In some areas, women were ordered to take gynecology exams after the ceremonies, they said. In others, officials outfitted special rooms with ultrasound scanners for pregnancy tests.“Test all who need to be tested,” ordered a township directive from 2018. “Detect and deal with those who violate policies early.”Abdushukur Umar was among the first to fall victim to the crackdown on children. A jovial Uighur tractor driver-turned-fruit merchant, the proud father considered his seven children a blessing from God.But authorities began pursuing him in 2016. The following year, he was thrown into a camp and later sentenced to seven years in prison — one for each child, authorities told relatives.Also read | US Congress approves China sanctions over ethnic crackdown“My cousin spent all his time taking care of his family, he never took part in any political movements,” Zuhra Sultan, Umar’s cousin, said from exile in Turkey. “How can you get seven years in prison for having too many children? We’re living in the 21st century — this is unimaginable.”Sixteen Uighurs and Kazakhs told the AP they knew people interned or jailed for having too many children. Many received years, even decades in prison.Leaked data obtained and corroborated by the AP showed that of 484 camp detainees listed in Karakax county in Xinjiang, 149 were there for having too many children - the most common reason for holding them. Time in a camp — what the government calls “education and training” — for parents with too many children is written policy in at least three counties, notices found by Zenz confirmed.In 2017, the Xinjiang government also tripled the already hefty fines for violating family planning laws for even the poorest residents — to at least three times the annual disposable income of the county. While fines also apply to Han Chinese, only minorities are sent to the detention camps if they cannot pay, according to interviews and data. Government reports show the counties collect millions of dollars from the fines each year.In other efforts to change the population balance of Xinjiang, China is dangling land, jobs and economic subsidies to lure Han migrants there. It is also aggressively promoting intermarriage between Han Chinese and Uighurs, with one couple telling the AP they were given money for housing and amenities like a washing machine, refrigerator and TV.“It links back to China’s long history of dabbling in eugenics….you don’t want people who are poorly educated, marginal minorities breeding quickly,” said James Leibold, a specialist in Chinese ethnic policy at La Trobe in Melbourne. “What you want is your educated Han to increase their birth rate.”Sultan describes how the policy looks to Uighurs like her: “The Chinese government wants to control the Uighur population and make us fewer and fewer, until we disappear.”Once in the detention camps, women are subjected to forced IUDs and what appear to be pregnancy prevention shots, according to former detainees. They are also made to attend lectures on how many children they should have.Seven former detainees told the AP that they were force-fed birth control pills or injected with fluids, often with no explanation. Many felt dizzy, tired or ill, and women stopped getting their periods. After being released and leaving China, some went to get medical check-ups and found they were sterile.It’s unclear what former detainees were injected with, but Xinjiang hospital slides obtained by the AP show that pregnancy prevention injections, sometimes with the hormonal medication Depo-Provera, are a common family planning measure. Side effects can include headaches and dizziness.Dina Nurdybay, a Kazakh woman, was detained in a camp which separated married and unmarried women. The married women were given pregnancy tests, Nurdybay recalled, and forced to have IUDs installed if they had children. She was spared because she was unmarried and childless.One day in February 2018, one of her cellmates, a Uighur woman, had to give a speech confessing what guards called her “crimes.” When a visiting official peered through the iron bars of their cell, she recited her lines in halting Mandarin.“I gave birth to too many children,” she said. “It shows I’m uneducated and know little about the law.”“Do you think it’s fair that Han people are only allowed to have one child?” the official asked, according to Nurdybay. “You ethnic minorities are shameless, wild and uncivilized.”Nurdybay met at least two others in the camps whom she learned were locked up for having too many children. Later, she was transferred to another facility with an orphanage that housed hundreds of children, including those with parents detained for giving birth too many times. The children counted the days until they could see their parents on rare visits.“They told me they wanted to hug their parents, but they were not allowed,” she said. “They always looked very sad.”Another former detainee, Tursunay Ziyawudun, said she was injected until she stopped having her period, and kicked repeatedly in the lower stomach during interrogations. She now can’t have children and often doubles over in pain, bleeding from her womb, she said.Ziyawudun and the 40 other women in her “class” were forced to attend family planning lectures most Wednesdays, where films were screened about impoverished women struggling to feed many children. Married women were rewarded for good behavior with conjugal visits from their husbands, along with showers, towels, and two hours in a bedroom. But there was a catch – they had to take birth control pills beforehand.Some women have even reported forced abortions. Ziyawudun said a “teacher” at her camp told women they would face abortions if found pregnant during gynecology exams.A woman in another class turned out to be pregnant and disappeared from the camp, she said. She added that two of her cousins who were pregnant got rid of their children on their own because they were so afraid.Another woman, Gulbahar Jelilova, confirmed that detainees in her camp were forced to abort their children. She also saw a new mother, still leaking breast milk, who did not know what had happened to her infant. And she met doctors and medical students who were detained for helping Uighurs dodge the system and give birth at home.In December 2017, on a visit from Kazakhstan back to China, Gulzia Mogdin was taken to a hospital after police found WhatsApp on her phone. A urine sample revealed she was two months pregnant with her third child. Officials told Mogdin she needed to get an abortion and threatened to detain her brother if she didn’t.During the procedure, medics inserted an electric vacuum into her womb and sucked her fetus out of her body. She was taken home and told to rest, as they planned to take her to a camp.Months later, Mogdin made it back to Kazakhstan, where her husband lives.“That baby was going to be the only baby we had together,” said Mogdin, who had recently remarried. “I cannot sleep. It’s terribly unfair.”The success of China’s push to control births among Muslim minorities shows up in the numbers for IUDs and sterilization.In 2014, just over 200,000 IUDs were inserted in Xinjiang. By 2018, that jumped more than 60 percent to nearly 330,000 IUDs. At the same time, IUD use tumbled elsewhere in China, as many women began getting the devices removed.A former teacher drafted to work as an instructor at a detention camp described her experience with IUDs to the AP.She said it started with flag-raising assemblies at her compound in the beginning of 2017, where officials made Uighur residents recite “anti-terror” lessons. They chanted, “If we have too many children, we’re religious extremists....That means we have to go to the training centers.”Police rounded up over 180 parents with too many children until “not a single one was left,” she said. At night, she said, she lay in bed, stiff with terror, as officers with guns and tasers hauled her neighbors away. From time to time police pounded on her door and searched her apartment for Qurans, knives, prayer mats and of course children, she said.“Your heart would leap out of your chest,” she said.Then, that August, officials in the teacher’s compound were told to install IUDs on all women of childbearing age. She protested, saying she was nearly 50 with just one child and no plans to have more. Officials threatened to drag her to a police station and strap her to an iron chair for interrogation.She was forced into a bus with four armed officers and taken to a hospital where hundreds of Uighur women lined up in silence, waiting for IUDs to be inserted. Some wept quietly, but nobody dared say a word because of the surveillance cameras hanging overhead.Also read | All is well with Muslims in Xinjiang, Beijing tells Islamic countriesHer IUD was designed to be irremovable without special instruments. The first 15 days, she got headaches and nonstop menstrual bleeding.“I couldn’t eat properly, I couldn’t sleep properly. It gave me huge psychological pressure,” she said. “Only Uighurs had to wear it.”Chinese health statistics also show a sterilization boom in Xinjiang.Budget documents obtained by Zenz show that starting in 2016, the Xinjiang government began pumping tens of millions of dollars into a birth control surgery program and cash incentives for women to get sterilized. While sterilization rates plunged in the rest of the country, they surged seven-fold in Xinjiang from 2016 to 2018, to more than 60,000 procedures. The Uighur-majority city of Hotan budgeted for 14,872 sterilizations in 2019 — over 34% of all married women of childbearing age, Zenz found.Even within Xinjiang, policies vary widely, being harsher in the heavily Uighur south than the Han-majority north. In Shihezi, a Han-dominated city where Uighurs make up less than 2% of the population, the government subsidizes baby formula and hospital birth services to encourage more children, state media reported.Zumret Dawut got no such benefits. In 2018, the mother of three was locked in a camp for two months for having an American visa.When she returned home under house arrest, officials forced her to get gynecology exams every month, along with all other Uighur women in her compound. Han women were exempted. They warned that if she didn’t take what they called “free examinations”, she could end up back in the camp.One day, they turned up with a list of at least 200 Uighur women in her compound with more than two children who had to get sterilized, Dawut recalled.“My Han Chinese neighbors, they sympathized with us Uighurs,” Dawut said. “They told me, ‘oh, you’re suffering terribly, the government is going way too far!’”Dawut protested, but police again threatened to send her back to the camp. During the sterilization procedure, Han Chinese doctors injected her with anesthesia and tied her fallopian tubes — a permanent operation. When Dawut came to, she felt her womb ache.“I was so angry,” she said. “I wanted another son.”Looking back, Omirzakh considers herself lucky.After that frigid day when officials threatened to lock her up, Omirzakh called relatives around the clock. Hours before the deadline, she scraped together enough money to pay the fine from the sale of her sister’s cow and high-interest loans, leaving her deep in debt.For the next year, Omirzakh attended classes with the wives of others detained for having too many children. She and her children lived with two local party officials sent specially to spy on them. When her husband was finally released, they fled for Kazakhstan with just a few bundles of blankets and clothes.The IUD still in Omirzakh’s womb has now sunk into her flesh, causing inflammation and piercing back pain, “like being stabbed with a knife.” For Omirzakh, it’s a bitter reminder of everything she’s lost — and the plight of those she left behind.“People there are now terrified of giving birth,” she said. “When I think of the word ‘Xinjiang,’ I can still feel that fear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-cuts-uighur-births-with-iuds-abortion-sterilization/story-7jFK0fCwrdIm9aMwKlIOhJ.html

Beijing passed the sweeping law for Hong Kong on Tuesday, which critics and many western governments fear will smother the finance hub’s freedoms and hollow out its autonomy.“US attempts to obstruct China advancing the Hong Kong national security legislation through so-called sanctions will never prevail,” said foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian.“In response to the US’s wrongful actions, China will take necessary countermeasures.”Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday that the US was ending the export of sensitive military items to Hong Kong because Washington “can no longer distinguish between the export of controlled items to Hong Kong or to mainland China”.The State Department will end all exports to Hong Kong on its controlled list, which includes items ranging from advanced ammunition to military hardware that already need the green light from the administration and Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-reiterate-over-us-ban-on-military-exports-to-hong-kong/story-7TlyEKWymU0grbrTgP8lpL.html
30-06-2020||World||Iran journalist who fueled 2017 protests sentenced to death||Iran sentenced a once-exiled journalist to death over his online work that helped inspire nationwide economic protests that began at the end of 2017, authorities said Tuesday.Ruhollah Zam’s website and a channel he created on the popular messaging app Telegram had spread the timings of the protests and embarrassing information about officials that directly challenged Iran’s Shiite theocracy. Those demonstrations represented the biggest challenge to Iran since the 2009 Green Movement protests and set the stage for similar mass unrest last November.The details of his arrest still remain unclear. Though he was based in Paris, Zam somehow returned to Iran and found himself detained by intelligence officials. A series of a televised confessions have aired in recent months over his work.Judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili announced Zam’s death sentence on Tuesday, saying he had been convicted of “corruption on Earth,” a charge often used in cases involving espionage or attempts to overthrow Iran’s government. It was not immediately clear when the sentence was handed down.Zam is able to appeal his sentence, issued by a Revolutionary Court. The name of his public defender wasn’t immediately known.Zam had run a website called AmadNews that posted embarrassing videos and information about Iranian officials. He highlighted his work on a channel on Telegram, the secure messaging app that remains incredibly popular among Iranians.The initial spark for the 2017 protests was a sudden jump in food prices. Many believe that hard-line opponents of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani instigated the first demonstrations in the conservative city of Mashhad in eastern Iran, trying to direct public anger at the president. But as protests spread from town to town, the backlash turned against the entire ruling class.Soon, cries directly challenging Rouhani and even Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei could be heard in online videos shared by Zam. Zam’s channel also shared times and organizational details for the protests as well.Telegram shut down the channel over Iranian government complaints it spread information about how to make gasoline bombs. The channel later continued under a different name. Zam, who has said he fled Iran after being falsely accused of working with foreign intelligence services, denied inciting violence on Telegram at the time.The 2017 protests reportedly saw some 5,000 people detained and 25 killed.Zam is the son of Shiite cleric Mohammad Ali Zam, a reformist who once served in a government policy position in the early 1980s. The cleric wrote a letter published by Iranian media in July 2017 in which he said he wouldn’t support his son over AmadNews’ reporting and messages on its Telegram channel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-journalist-who-fueled-2017-protests-sentenced-to-death/story-hWZYyd91SaDU4k97qR8BzK.html
30-06-2020||World||China Muslim sterilization reports ‘shocking’ and ‘disturbing’: Mike Pompeo||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday labeled as “shocking” and “disturbing” reports that China’s ruling Communist Party is using forced sterilization, forced abortion and coercive family planning against minority Muslims.Pompeo highlighted a report about the situation in China’s Xinjiang region by German researcher Adrian Zenz published by the Washington-based Jamestown Foundation think tank.Pompeo, a persistent critic of China, including its treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang, said in a statement the findings were consistent with decades of Chinese Communist Party practices “that demonstrate an utter disregard for the sanctity of human life and basic human dignity”. “We call on the Chinese Communist Party to immediately end these horrific practices and ask all nations to join the United States in demanding an end to these dehumanizing abuses.”In his report, Zenz said his findings represented the strongest evidence yet that Beijing’s policies in Xinjiang met one of the genocide criteria cited in the U.N. Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, namely “imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group.”Zenz said analysis of Chinese government documents showed natural population growth in Xinjiang had fallen “dramatically.” He said that in its two largest Uighur Muslim prefectures, growth rates fell by 84% between 2015 and 2018 and further in 2019.The Chinese Embassy in Washington referred to a statement by Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, saying that “some institutions are bent on cooking up disinformation on Xinjiang-related issues. ... Their allegations are simply groundless and false.”Documents from 2019 revealed plans for a campaign of mass female sterilization targeting 14% and 34% of all married women of childbearing age in two Uighur counties, Zenz wrote. The campaign, he said, likely aimed to sterilize rural minority women with three or more children, as well as some with two children - equivalent to at least 20% of all women of childbearing age.“Budget figures indicate that this project had sufficient funding for performing hundreds of thousands of tubal ligation sterilization procedures in 2019 and 2020,” he wrote.Zenz said that by 2019, Xinjiang planned to subject at least 80% of women of childbearing age in its four southern minority prefectures to intrusive birth prevention surgeries - placement of intrauterine devices or sterilizations.He said that in 2018, 80% of all new IUD placements in China were performed in Xinjiang, while only 1.8% of the population live there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-muslim-sterilization-reports-shocking-and-disturbing-mike-pompeo/story-N2s5blfbIWTEUsuRc4Y1bL.html
30-06-2020||World||Xi Jinping takes control of China’s military reserve forces||China’s military reserve forces will be formally placed under the centralised and unified command of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Central Military Commission (CPC), both headed by President Xi Jinping, from July 1 to ensure the ruling party’s “absolute leadership” over it and build a world-class army.Currently, the reserve forces are under the dual leadership of military organs and local Communist Party committees and they would be brought under the control of the ruling party and the CMC from July 1, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in 2017 announced plans to reduce the strength of the reserve forces and bring them under the control of the central leadership as part of the reforms of the military.The reforms included cutting down the size of the military by three lakh troops reducing the size of the PLA, the world’s largest military force, to two million personnel.An official announcement on Sunday said the reserve forces are “an important part of the PLA and the adjustment in the leadership structure is aimed at upholding the CPC’s absolute leadership over the army and building a strong military in the new era.” It calls on relevant military and civilian units to take active and coordinated measures to implement the changes to the leadership structure.Since he took over power in 2013, Xi, 67, has ordered all PLA ranks to strictly under the CPC leadership. Xi is also the General Secretary of the CPC.China watchers have called Xi the most powerful Chinese leader since Chairman Mao Zedong, especially since he managed to amend the Constitution to end the two-term presidential limit in 2018. According to the reforms process announced in 2017, the CMC will take charge of the overall administration of the PLA, the Chinese People’s Armed Police and the militia and reserve forces. This meant that all forces would work directly under central leadership headed by Xi. The thrust of the reforms included a reduction of the ground forces and an increase in the role and scope of the Navy and the Air Force as part of China’s push to expand its global influence.The structure of the reserve forces will adapt to information warfare from traditional combat-oriented and mechanised ones, the PLA announced in 2017. China’s current reserve forces are mainly composed of reserve military officers and soldiers as well as a small number of active-service military personnel. Reserve military officers are selected from eligible veteran officers, local officials, and officers in the people’s armed force, militia cadres and related technical personnel. “Centralising the leadership of reserve forces will make it easier to mobilise and manage reserve forces. They are important supplementary parts of active-duty military units,” Li Daguang, a professor at the National Defense University of the PLA, told the Global Times.Many reserve forces have their specialities. Military news outlet 81.cn reported on June 15 that Tibet has five militia groups involved in patrols, communication, engagements and rapid response. Twenty personnel, who are good at wrestling and unarmed combat from a fighting club, are reportedly enrolled as members of the militia.Li said that reserve forces in China would not be normally mobilised until a large-scale local war breaks out. Song Zhongping, a Chinese mainland military expert and TV commentator, told the daily that China has always kept a close watch on the developments of reserve forces in the border areas, especially in the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, as they are important parts of local military preparedness and battles against separatism. The PLA Tibet Military Command’s reserve forces are an example. The militia has adjusted to the cold and thin air environment, and are superior in high-altitude warfare. Their special abilities will greatly help the PLA, Song said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-takes-control-of-china-s-military-reserve-forces/story-lyq20Ny0pb8psWB1hBOERN.html

He was in Uzbekistan on Tuesday and was expected in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, later in the day or on Wednesday, and was also to travel to Doha, Qatar, where the Taliban maintain a political office.Khalilzad is also holding video conferences with Kabul leaders rather than travelling to the Afghan capital because of the dangers of COVID-19, according to a US State Department statement. Afghanistan’s dilapidated health system is grappling with the pandemic, with the number of infections thought to far outnumber the official tally of over 31,000 cases, including 733 deaths.The implementation of the US-Taliban deal has reached critical stage, with the Taliban and Kabul’s leaders expected to hold negotiations on a framework for a post-war Afghanistan that would end the fighting and bring the insurgents into the country’s political arena.The talks are expected to begin sometime in July — if both sides abide by a promise laid out in the US-Taliban deal to release thousands of prisoners. The agreement calls for Kabul to release 5,000 imprisoned Taliban while the insurgents would release 1,000 government and military personnel they hold captive. But the prisoner releases have been marked by delays; Kabul has so far released 3,500 and the Taliban have freed about 700.Shaheen tweeted that Pompeo and Baradar discussed the “implementation of the agreement, foreign troop withdrawal, prisoner release, start of intra-Afghan dialogue and reduction in (military) operations.” The US State Department has not commented on the video conference.Baradar complained about new Afghan military checkpoints in areas under Taliban control while Pompeo said Washington wanted to see a reduction in violence, according to the tweet.A US official close to the peace process, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter with journalists, said Pompeo emphasized in Monday night’s video call the imperative that the Taliban abide by their commitment to battle other militants operating in Afghanistan — specifically terror groups that could threaten the US or its allies, a reference that alludes to the Islamic State group.The Taliban have denied the allegations that they were paid by Russia to kill Americans in Afghanistan. The Associated Press has reported that Russia began paying the bounties back in early 2019, even as Khalilzad was trying to finalize the deal with the insurgent group to end Washington’s longest war and withdraw US soldiers.Violence in Afghanistan has continued to spike since a three-day cease-fire in May for a major Muslim holiday. As civilian casualties rise, both the Taliban and the government blame each other. On Monday, 23 civilians were killed in an attack on a busy market in the southern province of Helmand, a Taliban heartland.In a tweet early Tuesday, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid invited foreign and Afghan journalists to visit the area, which is controlled by the Taliban and has been off-limits to reporters, to independently check out claims about the attack.The Afghan government said a powerful bomb and mortar fire by the Taliban caused the deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-calls-taliban-leader-amid-russian-bounty-scandal/story-hjUBjY7Rikr782dz7kg5UI.html

The Indian government’s decision was based on security concerns.“China is strongly concerned, and we are verifying the situation,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Tuesday during a press briefing.He further said that India has a responsibility to uphold the rights of Chinese businesses.India on Monday banned the apps in its strongest move yet targeting China in the online space since a border crisis erupted between the two countries earlier this month. Also Watch | Chinese apps banned: Alternatives to TikTok, CamScanner, ES File ExplorerThe apps banned by India include ByteDance’s popular video sharing platform TikTok and Tencent’s WeChat.Also Read: India’s decision becomes trending topic on social media in ChinaIn a statement on Tuesday, TikTok said that it did not pass on any information about its users to any foreign government including the Chinese government and would not do so in the future too.“TikTok continues to comply with all data privacy and security requirements under Indian law and has not shared any information of our users in India with any foreign government, including the Chinese government,” the statement from TikTok India head Nikhil Gandhi said.The other Chinese apps which have been banned are Club Factory, SHAREit, Likee, Mi Video Call (Xiaomi), Weibo, Baidu and Bigo Live. They have been removed from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store for India.The order came after India toughened its stance against China following the border skirmish. Home Minister Amit Shah, officials told Hindustan Times, had powered the decision that had been under discussion for weeks within the bureaucracy.The government’s move has been welcomed by the industry. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said that the ban will be a big support to its ‘Boycott Chinese Goods’ campaign.ShareChat Director Public Policy Berges Malu also welcomed the move.Internet Service Providers Association of India (ISPAI) also lauded the move.“This should have done long back, good step... ISPAI will act very swiftly to block these apps once the order comes,” its president Rajesh Chharia said.Naveen Tewari, Founder and CEO of InMobi Group, said, “This is the digital Aatmanirbhar moment that most Indians have been rooting for”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/strongly-concerned-verifying-the-situation-china-on-india-s-move-to-ban-tiktok-58-other-apps/story-GjwmW1xFNwnWuzUbJw2WGJ.html
30-06-2020||World||Israel’s annexation of West bank can only be stopped from within||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears determined to carry out his pledge to begin annexing parts of the occupied West Bank, possibly as soon as Wednesday.His vision of redrawing the map of the Holy Land, in line with President Donald Trump’s Mideast plan, has been welcomed by Israel’s religious and nationalist right wing and condemned by the Palestinians and the international community.But with opponents offering little more than condemnations, there seems little to prevent Netanyahu from embarking on a plan that could permanently alter the Mideast landscape.Here’s a closer look at annexation:WHY ANNEXATION, AND WHY NOW?Israel’s right wing has long favored annexing parts or all of the West Bank, saying the territory is vital for the country’s security and an inseparable part of the biblical Land of Israel. But most of the world considers the West Bank, captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war, to be occupied territory, and Israel’s dozens of settlements, now home to nearly 500,000 Jewish Israelis, as illegal.Surrounded by a team of settler allies, Trump has upended US policy, recognizing contested Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, moving the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, recognizing Israel’s 1981 annexation of the Golan Heights and announcing that Jewish settlements are not illegal.Seeking to court hard-line voters on the campaign trail, Netanyahu last year began talking about annexation. After Trump released his Mideast plan in January envisioning permanent Israeli control over 30% of the West Bank, including all of Israel’s settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley region, Netanyahu quickly jumped on board. Israel and the US have formed a joint committee to map out precisely which areas Israel can keep.Netanyahu made sure that under the coalition agreement, he can bring a proposal to the new government anytime after July 1. He appears eager to move forward before the November presidential election, possibly with a limited move billed as a first stage, especially with Trump’s re-election prospects in question.WHY IS THERE SO MUCH OPPOSITION?The Palestinians seek the entire West Bank as the heartland of a future independent state and believe the Trump plan would deliver a fatal blow to their fading hopes of statehood.Among the plan’s components: The Palestinians would only have limited autonomy in a fraction of territory they seek. Isolated Israeli settlements deep inside Palestinian territory would remain intact, and the Israeli military would retain overall security control over the Palestinian entity.The international community has invested billions of dollars in promoting a two-state solution since the interim Oslo peace accords of the 1990s. The UN secretary general, the European Union and leading Arab countries have all said that Israeli annexation would violate international law and greatly undermine the prospects for Palestinian independence.WILL ANYTHING CHANGE ON THE GROUND?Not immediately. Israel has controlled the entire West Bank for more than 50 years. Palestinians will remain in their towns and villages, while Israelis will live in their newly annexed settlements. The Palestinian Authority is protesting annexation but has ruled out any kind of violent response.But over time, there is a larger risk of conflict.Netanyahu has said he opposes granting citizenship to Palestinians living on annexed lands, presumably because it would undercut Israel’s Jewish majority. But failing to grant equal rights to Palestinians in annexed areas opens Israel up to charges of establishing an apartheid system that would draw heavy international condemnation.Palestinians who are not living on annexed lands could face other challenges. Moving between Palestinian population centers — or even reaching their own properties and farmlands — could become difficult if they have to cross through Israeli territory. Critics say that Israel could also use its sovereignty to expropriate Palestinian lands.The Palestinian Authority has already cut off its ties with Israel to protest the looming annexation. In the absence of any peace prospects, the Palestinian Authority could see its international funding dry up or decide to close.The collapse of the authority could force Israel, as an occupying power, to pick up the tab for governing the Palestinians. In the long term, it could lead to Palestinian and international calls to establish a single binational state with voting rights for all — a scenario that could spell the end of Israel as a Jewish-majority state.WHY DOESN’T THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY STOP THIS?UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said annexation would mark a “most serious violation of international law.” The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has warned of “significant consequences.” Jordan and Egypt, the only Arab states at peace with Israel, have condemned the annexation plan. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, powerful Arab players with informal relations with Israel, have said warming ties will be in danger.But Israel and the US appear to be banking on the international community’s poor record of translating rhetoric into concrete action. Days after the UAE warned Israel against annexation, for instance, two Emirati companies reached cooperation deals with Israeli partners in the fight against the coronavirus.Thanks to the US veto over UN Security Council decisions, international sanctions appear to be out of the question. Divisions within the EU make concerted European reaction unlikely as well.Individual countries might seek to impose limited sanctions against Israel, and the International Criminal Court in the Hague could take annexation into account as it weighs whether to launch a war crimes investigation into Israeli policies.CAN ANYTHING STOP ANNEXATION?The biggest obstacle to Netanyahu appears to be from within. US officials say they are unlikely to allow Israel to move forward unless Netanyahu and his coalition partner, Defense Minister Benny Gantz, are in agreement.Gantz, a former military chief and bitter rival of Netanyahu, has said Israel should move carefully and in coordination with regional partners. Gantz laid the groundwork for further delays Monday when he said his top priority is guiding the country through the coronavirus crisis.“Anything unrelated to the battle against the coronavirus will wait,” he said.Ironically, some hard-line settler leaders have also opposed the plan, saying they cannot accept any program that envisions a Palestinian state.If the issue remains frozen, time could run out on Netanyahu. The presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, has said he opposes annexation. A Biden victory in November could mean that any Israeli annexation will be short-lived.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-s-annexation-of-west-bank-can-only-be-stopped-from-within/story-VHnYvI9l8BoCfuLqdRE4GM.html
30-06-2020||World||Singapore PM’s brother backs opposition but won’t seek election||Lee Hsien Yang, the estranged younger brother of Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, will not contest in the city-state’s July 10 general elections, deflating the hype built up after he joined the opposition as the nine-day campaigning period kicked off Tuesday.“I have chosen not to stand for political office because I believe Singapore does not need another Lee,” he said in a Facebook post after the nomination deadline passed. “I do not seek power, prestige or financial rewards of political office. I hope to be a catalyst for change.”The younger Lee’s entry into the opposition Progress Singapore Party, announced last week, fueled speculation he could stand as a candidate against the incumbent People’s Action Party, led by his elder brother, which has won every contest since independence in 1965.While Singapore doesn’t allow opinion polls, most analysts expect the PAP to easily win again. Still, any narrowing of its victory margin could reflect an erosion of confidence in its new generation of leaders, particularly regarding how they are handling the pandemic.Despite declining to run himself, Lee, 62, will campaign against the ruling party co-founded and built up by his father Lee Kuan Yew, the nation’s founding prime minister, which his older brother now leads. The siblings have been sparring over the estate of their father since his death in 2015, and the rivalry has spilled over into other conflicts.Campaigning ahead of the July 10 vote will likely focus on Singapore’s response to Covid-19 and its economic fallout. The PAP’s election manifesto hails its ability to steer the country through the coronavirus crisis, while numerous opposition parties will surface issues such as the expected increase in the goods-and-services tax and retrenchment insurance.Family DramaLee Hsien Loong, who turns 70 in 2022, has signaled his intent to make way for his successor, widely expected to be current Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat. While the prime minister has largely avoided government scandals since he took office in 2004, the family drama has been brewing in recent years. He said on Monday that the election isn’t about him or any family disputes, but about Singapore’s future at a critical juncture, according to the Straits Times.The siblings have clashed over Lee Kuan Yew’s will, and in particular, his famous Oxley Road house. Lee Hsien Yang’s wife is in a legal tussle over accusations that she mishandled the will, and his son -- an assistant professor of economics at Harvard University -- faces a court charge for disparaging remarks about the judicial system that were posted on a private Facebook post.This will be the first election for the Progress Singapore Party, which was founded last year by former ruling party members who became disgruntled with the government. It has seen a surge in donations in recent days, with its leader Tan Cheng Bock -- a former PAP lawmaker and presidential candidate -- describing it as the “Lee Hsien Yang effect.”“People must get away from that notion that his coming into this particular political journey is just to hope to talk more about what happened about Oxley and so on,” Tan said on Monday during a briefing. “It’s nothing to be connected to his family, because he believed in what we started out, our party.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-pm-s-brother-backs-opposition-but-won-t-seek-election/story-zQAez6bp0OWriD7dzh6lPO.html
30-06-2020||World||China reports 19 new Covid-19 cases, including 7 in Beijing||China on Tuesday reported 19 new coronavirus cases in the mainland for June 29, up from 12 a day earlier, the health authority said. There were no new deaths. Of the new infections, seven were in Beijing, the National Health Commission said in a statement. The capital city, which is battling a fresh outbreak, had also reported seven new infections for June 28. Mainland China reported four new asymptomatic patients, who tested positive for Covid-19 but showed no clinical symptoms such as a fever, down from six a day earlier. As of June 29, mainland China had a total of 83,531 confirmed coronavirus cases, while the death toll stands at 4,634.Beijing has been carrying out mass testing for the coronavirus since the city reported its first case in the latest outbreak on June 11. The infections were linked to Beijing’s sprawling Xinfadi wholesale food centre.The State Post Bureau, which oversees the country’s postal service, said on Tuesday that as of June 27, 104,807 workers from major delivery firms in the city had been tested and no positive results were found, according to a report by state broadcaster CCTV.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-19-new-covid-19-cases-including-7-in-beijing/story-smahlwI3NnQYMiOekxpaRO.html
30-06-2020||World||Trump visa freeze endangers India tech industry’s talent model||Indian and US technology companies are urging the Trump administration to reconsider an executive order freezing access to many work visas, warning the move would undermine a business model used to supply high-skill talent to clients from Wall Street to Silicon Valley.Donald Trump’s order last week halts approvals of a range of visas through year-end, including those for intra-company transfers and study-abroad programs, and is aimed at giving Americans preference after record job losses from the coronavirus pandemic. Key for the tech industry are H-1B visas used by workers from India and other countries to fill key roles.Visa processing is an elaborate, months-long affair so any disruption could hurt the ability of critical workers to travel to clients sites for an extended period. Already, the virus lockdowns have blocked consulate visits essential to the process and forced hundreds of thousands of workers into challenging work-from-home situations.India’s technology trade group, Nasscom, called Trump’s order “misguided and harmful to the US economy” and warned it would exacerbate the country’s economic pain. Indian companies provide technology staff and services to US hospitals, drugmakers and biotechnology companies, Nasscom pointed out. In addition, the industry may send more workers to Canada or Mexico without access to the US market.“These are highly-skilled workers who are in great demand and they will be mobile no matter what,” said Shivendra Singh, president of global trade development at Nasscom.Among the other critics of the order were Alphabet Inc. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai, Microsoft Corp. President Brad Smith and Tesla Inc. founder Elon Musk. Pichai, himself a beneficiary of the H-1B visa system in the 1990s, tweeted, “Immigration has contributed immensely to America’s economic success making it a global leader in tech, and also Google the company it is today.”Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Infosys Ltd. and Wipro Ltd., among the largest outsourcing companies in Asia, declined to comment.India accounts for about 70% of the 85,000 H-1B visas issued annually, according to immigration data. Of this total, 65,000 visas are issued to foreign talent with bachelor’s degrees, while the remaining 20,000 can be allotted to workers who have more advanced degrees.The visa system was conceived so companies could hire overseas workers to fill a shortage of high-skilled talent in technology services and product development. The fact that Indian outsourcers collect a substantial share of the visas each year has made the program controversial, with critics arguing that companies abuse the system by replacing American workers with cheaper foreign labor.Soon after taking office, Trump vowed he would crack down on work visas and reform the “broken” immigration system. One longer-term concern for outsourcers is the administration’s planned revamp of the current H-1B visa program, which would replace the current lottery system for determining who gets visas with a merit-based system that prioritizes applicants based on wages. That would mean more workers with high salaries would likely receive visas.Now, outsourcing companies are dealing with the unpredictability of the visa situation and the prospect that an H-1B revamp could make it difficult to send anyone but the most critical of talent overseas.Trump Orders Freeze on Many Work Visas Through End of Year The most recent visa curbs could hammer outsourcers’ current model of talent deployment. Companies are beginning to question whether so much onsite travel is necessary, and some are ramping up local hiring or local subcontractors. The pandemic has prompted companies to look at worker clusters away from client sites but close enough to collaborate on projects. For instance, if a company has 20,000 employees spread across 40 cities, these could be aggregated in a few clusters and if the visa restrictions continue, the clusters may not be in Texas or New Jersey but in Canada or Mexico.“Offshoring could increase because, for clients, the virus lockdowns have already driven home the merits of remote working,” said Singh, speaking over the phone from New Delhi.Indian companies could see an impact on their margins because of increased worker salaries, higher costs of local hiring and subcontracting and the collateral damage from visa rejections and prolonged processing times. “The temporary suspension of H-1B visa programme till December 2020 will hamper execution of pipeline and new projects coupled with margin impact resulting from higher onshore hiring,” credit rating company ICRA said in a note last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-visa-freeze-endangers-india-tech-industry-s-talent-model/story-NZ6cjutnpJiqd4N918rnPL.html
30-06-2020||World||‘Things moving in right direction but fight not over’: Justin Trudeau on Canada’s Covid-19 battle||Canada is moving in the right direction as far as combatting the Covid-19 pandemic is concerned, but the fight is not yet over, the country’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned. His statement came as health authorities released new projections that indicate that coronavirus infections are sharply tapering off.“After a very challenging spring, things are continuing to move in the right direction,” Trudeau said during a daily media briefing. However, that came with the proviso that Canadians continue to “follow local public health guidelines to keep each other safe.” Canada is gradually opening up and there is some concern that could contribute to the disease bouncing back.Among those who have voiced that worry is Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam. She said they “expect to see some resurgence of cases” as restrictive measures were lifted across the nation.She expanded on that warning, as she said, “Dynamic models are telling us that if we relax too much or too soon the epidemic will most likely rebound with explosive growth as a distinct possibility.”Latest modelling was also released and it indicates that Canada will record between 1,04,000 and 1,08,000 cases by July 12, with deaths ranging between 8,545 and 8,865. On Monday, the total fatalities due to Covid-19 was at 8,566, and overall cases at 1,03,799.Among the matters being taken into consideration is the increase in cases in the United States after lockdowns were lifted in several states. Trudeau said that “highlights” to Canadian authorities that “even as our economy is re-opening, we need to make sure we are continuing to remain vigilant, individually and collectively.”Tam underscored that the coronavirus had yet to be eliminated and no effective vaccine was available. “The epidemiology indicates that transmission is largely under control, while also showing us that cases can reemerge at any time or place,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/things-moving-in-right-direction-but-fight-not-over-justin-trudeau-on-canada-s-covid-19-battle/story-iPhtXUhX5p4H6hEyR1erlM.html
30-06-2020||World||China passes Hong Kong security law amid global opposition||China’s parliament passed national security legislation for Hong Kong on Tuesday, setting the stage for the most radical changes to the former British colony’s way of life since it returned to Chinese rule almost exactly 23 years ago.State media is expected to publish details of the law - which comes in response to last year’s often-violent pro-democracy protests in the city and aims to tackle subversion, terrorism, separatism and collusion with foreign forces - later on Tuesday.Amid fears the legislation will crush the global financial hub’s rights and freedoms, and reports that the heaviest penalty would be life imprisonment, prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong said he would quit his Demosisto group.“It marks the end of Hong Kong that the world knew before,” Wong said on Twitter.The legislation pushes Beijing further along a collision course with the United States, Britain and other Western governments, which have said it erodes the high degree of autonomy the city was granted at its July 1, 1997, handover.The United States began eliminating Hong Kong’s special status under US law on Monday, halting defence exports and restricting the territory’s access to high technology products.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, speaking at her regular weekly news conference, said it was not appropriate for her to comment on the legislation as the meeting in Beijing was still going on, but she threw a jibe at the United States.“No sort of sanctioning action will ever scare us,” Lam said.Lau Siu-kai, vice-president of a think-tank under the Beijing cabinet’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, told Reuters the internationally criticised law was passed unanimously with 162 votes. The editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a tabloid published by the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party, said on Twitter the heaviest penalty under the law was life imprisonment, without providing details.Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong have repeatedly said the legislation is aimed at a few “troublemakers” and will not affect rights and freedoms, nor investor interests.It comes into force as soon as it is gazetted in Hong Kong, which is seen as imminent.‘REGRETTABLE’ This month, China’s official Xinhua news agency unveiled some of the law’s provisions, including that it would supersede existing Hong Kong legislation and that the power of interpretation belongs to China’s parliament top committee.Beijing is expected to set up a national security office in Hong Kong for the first time to “supervise, guide and support” the city government. Beijing could also exercise jurisdiction on certain cases.Judges for security cases are expected to be appointed by the city’s chief executive. Senior judges now allocate rosters up through Hong Kong’s independent judicial system.It is unclear which specific activities are to be made illegal, how precisely they are defined or what punishment they carry.Police have banned this year’s July 1 rally on the anniversary of the 1997 handover, citing coronavirus restrictions. It is unclear if attending the rally would constitute a national security crime if the law came into force by Wednesday.South China Morning Post, citing “police insiders”, said about 4,000 officers will be on stand-by on Wednesday to handle any unrest if people defy the ban.Hong Kong is one of many developing conflicts between China and the United States, on top of trade, the South China Sea and the coronavirus pandemic.Britain has said the security law would violate China’s international obligations and its handover agreement. A Japanese official said that if China had passed the law, it was “regrettable”. Democratically ruled and Chinese-claimed Taiwan said it “strongly condemns” the legislation, while the European Union has said it could take China to the International Court of Justice in The Hague over it.China has hit back at the outcry, denouncing “interference” in internal affairs.Hong Kong stocks were up 0.9% on Tuesday, in line with Asian markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-passes-hong-kong-security-law-amid-global-opposition/story-bAwJeFmohsHtIPUXZHmViL.html
30-06-2020||World||US eager to work with India on 6GHz band for wireless, says Ajit Pai||The US is eager to work with India to harness the benefits of the powerful 6 GHz band for Wi-Fi and towards global harmonisation of this spectrum, Ajit Pai, the top American communications regulatory official has said. Addressing to the US-India Business Council webinar on creating alignment in the 5G Ecosystem, Pai, Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said, “during my visit to India in February, I had a good discussion with Indian officials about our 6 GHz efforts, so I know that India is interested in exploring the possibilities of unlicensed use in this band.” “I’m eager to work with my Indian counterparts and other leaders around the world to harness the benefits of the 6 GHz band for Wi-Fi and then work together toward global harmonisation of this spectrum,” the senior Indian-American official said.Ultimately, Wi-Fi 6 and 5G will complement each other nicely and form a powerful 1-2 punch of licensed and unlicensed innovation, he told the virtual audience.Asserting that the partnership between the US and India will be the defining one of the 21st century, Pai said that over the past three-plus years, it’s been gratifying to see the bonds between the US and India grow stronger and stronger.“We saw the vitality of this special friendship on full display this past February,” he said, referring to the historic visit of the US President Donald Trump to India in February. He was part of the US delegation.“From my bilateral visits with my counterparts in the Indian government to the state banquet at Rashtrapati Bhavan and conversations with Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi, the energy and excitement was incredible,” he said.“The trip left me with an even deeper appreciation of the common values our countries share and an even stronger determination to help bring the world’s oldest and largest democracies even closer together,” Pai said.Reiterating that the US and India share not only a set of common values, he said the two countries also share strategic interests.“We are both deeply committed to harnessing the power of communications technology to promote mutual growth and prosperity for our people. And we both deeply value the importance of connecting all of our citizens. That means, in part, unlocking the power and potential of 5G technology,” he said.Pai said that Wi-Fi 6, the next generation of Wi-Fi, has already started rolling out. “Wi-Fi 6 will be over two-and-a-half times faster than the current standard, and it will offer better performance for connected devices. But in order to fully take advantage of the benefits of Wi-Fi 6, we need to make more mid-band spectrum available for unlicensed use,” he said.In April, he said the commission unanimously approved his proposal to make the entire 6 GHz band available for unlicensed use.“By doing this, we are creating a massive 1,200 megahertz testbed for innovators and innovation. This is a big deal. We’ve effectively increased the amount of mid-band spectrum available for Wi-Fi by almost a factor of five,” he said.During the webinar, discussions around the development of product and services veered around the prowess of software professionals in India and the business opportunity for gadgets and equipment in the US.“Massive technology expertise is available in India, and it can be turned into an advantage for new technology services in next-generation architecture, not only in 5G but also in Wi fi,” said Shekhar Ayyar, executive vice president and general manager of VMware’s Telco and Edge Cloud business unit.Stressing the importance of spectrum available for commercial use, Rajan S Mathews, director general of Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), India’s leading industry association of mobile service providers and telecom equipment companies said, “It’s mind-blowing that in 5G spectrum the US is talking about 100 Mhz and saying that is not enough whereas in India we are struggling with 45 Mhz.” Mathew Oommen, president Reliance-Jio cautioned both US and India from the Chinese telecom gears.He reiterated the point recently made by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about Clean Telco and clean infrastructure. “It is critical how we ensure that we don’t contaminate digital infrastructure,” he said.“The knowledge coming from the US on 5G is very useful. India is not looking at 5G only for cellular networks. There is growing proximity between India and US, and it’s interesting to see India exporting handsets to the US and going forward we see the transfer of knowledge and expertise on network side from the US to India, it’s going to be two-way transactions in this relationship,” said Rajen Vagadia, vice president and president- Qualcomm India and SAARC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-eager-to-work-with-india-on-6ghz-band-for-wireless-says-ajit-pai/story-QmFjzjaufHLqsoL1H3giUO.html
30-06-2020||World||Boeing begins crucial certification test flights for grounded 737 MAX||Boeing Co began a series of long-delayed flight tests of its redesigned 737 MAX with regulators at the controls on Monday, hoping to win approval and rebuild its reputation after fatal crashes that toppled its leaders and grounded the jet worldwide.Pilots from the U.S. FAA and Boeing landed around 2:15 p.m. local time at King County International Airport, also known as Boeing Field, after a round trip to eastern Washington that included a high-speed system test and other maneuvers over about three hours.Reuters first reported the long-awaited certification test flights, scheduled over three days, were set to start on Monday, a pivotal moment in Boeing’s worst-ever corporate crisis triggered by twin crashes that killed 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia.Boeing shares closed 14.4% higher at $194.49 on Monday, helping boost the Dow Jones Industrial Average. After the flights are completed, the FAA must analyze reams of test data and approve new pilot training procedures, among other reviews, and would not likely approve the plane’s ungrounding until September, industry and government sources say. If that happens, the jet is on a path to resume U.S. service before year-end, though the process has been plagued by delays for more than a year. Boeing did not publicize Monday’s take off, saying the FAA was leading the 737 MAX testing process. The business-as-usual atmosphere at Boeing Field illustrated a shift in Boeing’s communications strategy on the 737 MAX since last year when it strained its relationship with the Federal Aviation Administration by issuing public statements that predicted the timeline for the jet’s return. The crisis has cost Boeing billions of dollars, slashed production and hobbled its supply chain, with criminal and congressional investigations still playing out. In December, Boeing fired Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg after scrutiny into the jet’s design and development tarnished its reputation with airlines and regulators. The 737 MAX gaining FAA approval to return to commercial service is expected to spark a scramble by Boeing to determine the fate of hundreds of parked jets. There are some 450 jets that Boeing is eager to deliver once the MAX is cleared to fly, though experts say the prospect of moving those quickly has been diminished by the coronavirus crisis. Airlines have also grounded a further 385 jets in their fleets, and U.S. carriers have said it will take them between 30 and 60 days after regulatory approval to prepare their jets and pilots for flight.A central task for the FAA is to validate Boeing’s upgrades to the MCAS anti-stall system faulted in both crashes, as well as perform a wide array of flight maneuvers and emergency procedures, the FAA said. The agency said it will “lift the grounding order only after we are satisfied that the aircraft meets certification standards.”After taking off from Boeing Field, the crew, which included Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Pilot Jim Webb, tested slow flight conditions between 12,000 feet and 15,000 feet, a person familiar with the flight said. Later, they boosted airspeed to 470 knots at 14,000 feet to conduct high-speed system tests, a person familiar with the flight said. The goal was likely a test of whether pilots were able to manually adjust the tail’s horizontal stabilizer at high speeds - a key focus during crash investigations because pilots struggled to make adjustments at high speeds while also trying to counteract MCAS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-begins-crucial-certification-test-flights-for-grounded-737-max/story-4KpZpo6WMFvOuiWEFZ7P8N.html
30-06-2020||World||‘No excuse’ for countries that fail in contact tracing: WHO chief||Tracing contacts of people with coronavirus infections is the most important step in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, and countries that are failing to do so have no excuse, the World Health Organization chief said on Monday.“Although many countries have made some progress, globally the pandemic is actually speeding up,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a briefing.“We all want this to be over. We all want to get on with our lives. But the hard reality is that this is not even close to being over,” he said. “Most people remain susceptible, the virus still has a lot of room to move.”Countries such as South Korea had managed to contain the disease by tracking down the contacts of those carrying infection, Tedros said. This was possible even under extreme conditions, as the WHO itself had shown by halting an outbreak of Ebola in eastern Congo, tracing 25,000 contacts a day in a remote area where some 20 armed groups were fighting, he added.“No excuse for contact tracing. If any country is saying contact tracing is difficult, it is a lame excuse.”TEAM TO INVESTIGATE ORIGINS IN CHINAIn a move sought by the WHO’s biggest critic, the United States, Tedros announced that a team would be sent to China next week to investigate the origins of the outbreak.“We can fight the virus better when we know everything about the virus, including how it started,” Tedros said. “We will be sending a team next week to China to prepare for that.”U.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have both said the disease could have escaped from a lab in Wuhan, although they have presented no evidence of this, and China denies it. Scientists say the virus emerged in nature.Trump has announced plans to quit the WHO, which he says is too close to China. He has repeatedly emphasised the Chinese origins of the virus, calling it “Kung Flu” at two rallies this month, a term the White House had previously described as unacceptable and which Asian-American groups say is racist.Asked about Trump’s use of the term, the director of the WHO’s emergencies program, Mike Ryan, called for an “international discourse that is based on mutual respect”.“Many people around the world have used unfortunate language in this response,” he said.Ryan said there had been tremendous progress towards finding a vaccine, but there was no guarantee of success. In the meantime countries must use the strategies available, such as social distancing and contact tracing.“Many, many countries through applying a comprehensive strategy have reached a very low level of virus transmission in their countries but always have to remain vigilant in case there are clusters or small outbreaks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-excuse-for-countries-that-fail-in-contact-tracing-who-chief/story-2ruRIALzGaoqAgI8WjXCUL.html
30-06-2020||World||US Republicans, Democrats want to question Trump aides over Russia bounty reports||Both Democrats and President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress demanded more information from the White House on Monday after reports that Russian military intelligence offered militants bounties for killing US troops in Afghanistan.“Congress and the country need answers now. I therefore request an interagency brief for all House Members immediately,” Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a letter to Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe and CIA Director Gina Haspel.“The questions that arise are: was the President briefed, and if not, why not, and why was Congress not briefed?” Pelosi wrote.Representative Mac Thornberry, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, joined the panel’s chairman, Democratic Representative Adam Smith, in asking the Department of Defense for a briefing.“The American people – and our service members – deserve to know the truth about what the White House knew about these Russian operations that may have directly resulted in the deaths of American service members,” Smith said.Thornberry told reporters on Monday that any delay “will not be acceptable.”Seven Republican House members, including Thornberry and Representative Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, attended a meeting at the White House on the issue on Monday afternoon.There was no word on whether the administration would brief more lawmakers or any non-Republicans.Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called for an immediate briefing for all 100 senators.Trump has dismissed the reports as “fake news” and took to Twitter to suggest the reports were being spread by media outlets trying to make Republicans look bad.Senator Marco Rubio, the Republican acting intelligence committee chairman, declined to comment on the reports, saying on Twitter the committee would “continue to conduct vigorous oversight” of threats facing the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-republicans-democrats-want-to-question-trump-aides-over-russia-bounty-reports/story-xFdDRObbVMoG8776UB1PaP.html
30-06-2020||World||‘Hateful conduct not allowed’: Twitch, Reddit crackdown targets Donald Trump, supporters||Reddit on Monday said it yanked a forum used by supporters of President Donald Trump as part of a crackdown on hateful posts at the popular online bulletin board while the game streaming platform Twitch briefly suspended the president.“r/The_Donald” was among some 2,000 forums or “subreddits” banned as tightening of rules at the news-focused social website, Reddit said.Twitch, the gaming platform owned by Amazon, said Trump’s channel was suspended over rules violations and that the offending content was removed.“Hateful conduct is not allowed on Twitch,” a spokesperson said.“We do not make exceptions for political or newsworthy content, and will take action on content reported to us that violates our rules.”Twitch said the offending comments aired on the channel included Trump’s remarks from 2015 saying that Mexicans coming into the United States were “bringing drugs,” “bringing crime” and were “rapists.”Also cited were his statements from a recent Tulsa rally that “a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away.”Reddit last year “quarantined” the pro-Trump forum for promoting violence and on Monday removed it.“Ultimately, it’s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people,” Reddit said in a post about its policy update.The longtime pro-Trump subreddit used by “has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average, antagonized us and other communities, and its (moderators) have refused to meet our most basic expectations,” Reddit added.Reddit’s new content policy specifically bans promoting hate based on identity or vulnerability, and calls for posts to be personal and authentic to prevent spam.“All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith,” Reddit said.“We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity.”“To be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit -- but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception.”The move comes with online platforms facing pressure to crack down on hateful content, including from the president, amid a broad movement to address racial equity in the wake of police killings of African-Americans.Trump has complained that Silicon Valley platforms are biased against conservatives, despite his own large social media following.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hateful-conduct-not-allowed-twitch-reddit-crackdown-targets-donald-trump-supporters/story-4AcPuynssBgdTNckBeyrYK.html
30-06-2020||World||Thousands flee in expectation of Myanmar military operation||Thousands of people in an area of western Myanmar where there have been clashes between the government and ethnic rebels have been fleeing from their villages over the past week after an evacuation order from officials.The Rakhine state government in an order last Tuesday instructed village administrators in Rathedaung township to tell residents to stay away from their homes due to military plans to conduct a “clearance operation” against the rebels. “Clearance operation” is Myanmar military parlance for counter insurgency action.The exodus from more than 40 villages is continuing almost a week later, even though the order was revoked last Friday Rakhine state’s security and border affairs minister.“Since the day the order was issued, more than 10,000 people from the operation area fled their villages,” Khin Maung Latt, an upper house member of parliament for Rathedaung township, said Monday.The government has been embroiled for more than a year in an intermittent conflict with the Arakan Army, a well-trained and well-armed guerrilla force representing members of the area’s Rakhine ethnic group.The guerrilla force is posing the strongest military challenge to the central government of the many ethnic minority groups who for decades have sought greater autonomy.Human rights advocates have accused Myanmar’s army of using undue force and targeting civilians in their operations fighting the guerrillas.In Rakhine in 2017, the military carried out counter insurgency operations against insurgents from the Muslim Rohingya minority, but critics charge they employed a campaign of terror to drive the Rohingya out of the country. An estimated 740,000 Rohingya fled to neighbouring Bangladesh, where they remain in refugee camps.The Rakhine are Buddhist, the religion of almost 90% of Myanmar’s people.During the past week’s exodus, some people fled to villages out of the designated area, and others to Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine.“We have to flee the village as we don’t want to face the soldiers from the military. They were shooting into the village, arresting the villagers to use as human shields,” said Aye Mg, a 58-year-old resident of Rathedaung township’s Kyauktan village, where the government previously detained dozens of suspected Rakhine militants.Civil society organizations and Buddhist monks are helping the newly displaced villagers find shelter.“People can’t live in their places any longer due to the fighting. We are hosting over 300 displaced people at our monastery; around 100 of them have arrived recently,” Okkahta, a monk, said from the Tahtipati Sipintharyar Monastery in Rathedaung town.“It’s like doomsday for them,” lawmaker Khin Maung Lat said, explaining why villagers fled. “They are in fear. This is the impact of the evacuation order to stay away from the village during the military operation.”“Even most of the village administrators are fleeing from the villages,” he said. “Even they are scared to go back to their villages.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-flee-in-expectation-of-myanmar-military-operation/story-92cXxu0MmTN1yz1YmPcU5N.html
30-06-2020||World||US Hong Kong sanctions threaten $1.1 trillion in China funding||China’s largest banks have $1.1 trillion in dollar funding at stake and face potentially steep fines from US legislation that targets penalizing lenders doing businesses with Chinese officials involved in Hong Kong’s controversial security law, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.The bipartisan measure, which was passed by the US Senate and still needs to go through the House and be signed by the US President, bars financial institution from providing accounts to sanctioned officials, many of whom may be assumed to use the services of China’s biggest banks, Francis Chan, a senior analyst at BI in Hong Kong, said in a June 30 note. Banks in violation risk being cut off from accessing the US financial system, he said.Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp., Bank of China Ltd. and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s four largest state-backed lenders, had a combined 7.5 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion) equivalent of US dollar liabilities at the end of 2019, of which 47% were deposits, according to their annual reports. The rest came from the interbank borrowing and issuing securities to global investors.The legislation would apply penalties against financial institutions only if a bank knowingly does business with an official under sanction. The bill is intended to keep the penalties from capturing a broad swath of US companies, an administration official familiar with the discussions said earlier. Banks will be informed of what entities are on the sanctions list before penalties are imposed, the person said.Global banks could also be at risk since Chinese officials, their relatives and associates may also be their customers, Chan said. Standard Chartered Plc paid more than $600 million in fines in 2019 for breaching sanctions against Burma, Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria. BNP Paribas SA was fined $8.9 billion by the US in 2014, the largest ever on an individual bank, for transactions with Sudan and other blacklisted nations.The Trump administration overnight escalated pressure on China over its crackdown on Hong Kong by making it harder to export sensitive technology to the city as Beijing is poised on Tuesday to pass the security law. The Commerce Department said it’s suspending regulations allowing special treatment to Hong Kong over things including export license exceptions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hong-kong-sanctions-threaten-1-1-trillion-in-china-funding/story-hVrgbqahfEaNEOixMs6PPO.html
30-06-2020||World||China passes controversial Hong Kong security law||China’s parliament passed national security legislation for Hong Kong on Tuesday, setting the stage for the most radical changes to the former British colony’s way of life since it returned to Chinese rule almost exactly 23 years ago.Cable TV, citing an unidentified source, said the law was passed unanimously by the Chinese parliament’s top decision-making body.The legislation pushes Beijing further along a collision course with the United States, Britain and other Western governments, which have said it erodes the high degree of autonomy the global financial hub was granted at its July 1, 1997 handover.The United States began eliminating Hong Kong’s special status under US law on Monday, halting defence exports and restricting the territory’s access to high technology products.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, speaking at her regular weekly news conference, said it was not appropriate for her to comment on the legislation as the meeting in Beijing was still ongoing, but threw a jibe at Washington.“No sort of sanctioning action will ever scare us,” Lam said.A draft of the law has yet to be published. Beijing says the law, which comes in response to last year’s often-violent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, aims to tackle subversion, terrorism, separatism and collusion with foreign forces.This month, China’s official state agency Xinhua unveiled some of its provisions, including that it would supersede existing Hong Kong legislation and that the power of interpretation belongs to China’s parliament top committee.Beijing is expected to set up a national security office in Hong Kong to “supervise, guide and support” the city government. Beijing could also exercise jurisdiction on certain cases.Judges for security cases are expected to be appointed by the city’s chief executive. Senior judges now allocate rosters up through Hong Kong’s independent judicial system.It is still unclear which specific activities are to be made illegal, how precisely they are defined or what punishment they carry.The South China Morning Post (SCMP), quoting an unnamed source, said Xinhua will publish details of the law on Tuesday afternoon and Hong Kong officials will gather at Beijing’s top representative office in the city later in the day for a meeting on the legislation.Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong have repeatedly said the legislation is aimed at a few “troublemakers” and will not affect rights and freedoms, nor investor interests.The law comes into force as soon as it is gazetted in Hong Kong, which is seen as imminent. Police have banned this year’s July 1 rally on the anniversary of the 1997 handover, citing coronavirus restrictions. It is unclear if attending the rally would constitute a national security crime if the law came into force by Wednesday.The SCMP, citing “police insiders”, said about 4,000 officers will be on stand by on Wednesday to handle any unrest if people defy the ban.INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATIONHong Kong is one of many developing conflicts between Beijing and Washington, on top of trade issues, the South China Sea and the coronavirus pandemic.Britain has said the security law would violate China’s international obligations and its handover agreement, which promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years under a “one country, two systems” formula.Japan’s chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Tuesday that if China had passed the security law for Hong Kong, it was “extremely regrettable”.The European Parliament earlier in June passed a resolution saying the European Union should take China to the International Court of Justice in The Hague if Beijing imposed the law.Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven countries have called on China not to push the legislation.China has hit back at the outcry from the West, denouncing what it called interference in its internal affairs.Hong Kong stocks were up 0.9% on Tuesday, in line with Asian markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-passes-controversial-hong-kong-security-law/story-bse1UEaBusJprQBT8zz77H.html
30-06-2020||World||New influenza virus G4 can trigger pandemic, needs close monitoring: Chinese scientists||Chinese pigs are more and more frequently becoming infected with a strain of influenza that has the potential to jump to humans, could mutate further so that it can spread easily from person to person and trigger a global outbreak, a new study has found.The study, which was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, focuses on an influenza virus named G4. G4 is genetically descended from the H1N1 strain that caused a pandemic in 2009.Scientists at Chinese universities and China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention say it possesses “all the essential hallmarks of being highly adapted to infect humans” and needs close monitoring.“It is of concern that human infection of G4 virus will further human adaptation and increase the risk of a human pandemic,” the researchers have said.The virus is a unique blend of three lineages: one similar to strains found in European and Asian birds, the H1N1 strain that caused the 2009 pandemic, and a North American H1N1 that has genes from avian, human, and pig influenza viruses.The G4 variant is especially concerning because its core is an avian influenza virus—to which humans have no immunity—with bits of mammalian strains mixed in.A team led by Liu Jinhua from the China Agricultural University (CAU) analysed nearly 30,000 nasal swabs taken from pigs at slaughterhouses in 10 Chinese provinces and 1,000 swabs from pigs with respiratory symptoms seen at their school’s veterinary teaching hospital from 2011 to 2018.It was a part of a project to identify potential pandemic influenza strains.The swabs collected yielded 179 swine influenza viruses, the vast majority of which were G4 or one of five other G strains from the Eurasian avianlike lineage.The researchers carried out various experiments including on ferrets, which are widely used in flu studies because they experience similar symptoms to humans such as fever, coughing and sneezing.They found that G4 was highly infectious, replicating in human cells and causing more serious symptoms in ferrets than other viruses. Tests also showed that any immunity humans gain from exposure to seasonal flu does not provide protection from G4.According to blood tests, which showed up antibodies created by exposure to the virus, 10.4% of swine workers had already been infected. The tests showed that as many as 4.4% of the general population also appeared to have been exposed.The virus has therefore already passed from animals to humans but there is no evidence yet that it can be passed from human to human -- the scientists’ main worry.They have called for strengthening the surveillance of Chinese pigs for influenza viruses and for urgent measures to monitor people working with pigs.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-influenza-virus-g4-can-trigger-pandemic-needs-close-monitoring-chinese-scientists/story-HYZdiz9eKlWO4QcmymZT6O.html

However, ExpressVPN had not been working in the Communist state for the past two days on iPhone as well as desktops.VPNs are powerful tools which allow users to overcome blocking of censorship and visit a particular website. But China has created such a technologically advanced firewall that it blocks even the VPNs.China is infamous for its repressive online censorship and the Xi Jinping government has refined it into an art with high-tech interventions. For example, anytime the word Hong Kong protest is mentioned on either CNN or BBC, the screens in Beijing go blank and news only returns after the topic is over.The blocking of Indian websites is the latest amid the ongoing tension between India and China after the Ladakh stand-off on June 15. The latest development coincides with the Indian government’s move to ban 59 applications, most of them Chinese.The popular apps which have been banned include TikTok, UC Browser, SHAREiT and WeChat. The government has cited concerns that these applications are “prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order”.The move comes after weeks of discussions within the government that began before the border dispute with China flared up earlier this month, but was expedited in the aftermath of the deadly June 15 confrontation in Galwan Valley, officials aware of the discussions told HT on the condition of anonymity.Officials cited above said Union home minister Amit Shah extended his support to the move to block the applications, and signed off on a recommendation by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla on Saturday before the order was formally issued by the IT ministry as per protocol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-websites-not-accessible-in-china-as-xi-jinping-govt-blocks-vpn-report/story-Q8KM5ZRP8dMFceCghGGJeI.html

US voters do not need to pay to register to vote.PrivacyWall did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.A Google spokeswoman said the company did not yet know how the ads had got through its approval process, which uses a combination of automated and manual review.“We have strict policies in place to protect users from false information about voting procedures, and when we find ads that violate our policies and present harm to users, we remove them and block advertisers from running similar ads in the future,” the spokeswoman said.“Some people may find it difficult to distinguish Google ads from other kinds of content because as of January, search ads on Google feature the same type face and colour scheme as organic search results,” the TTP report said.Social media companies and online platforms, including Facebook Inc and Twitter are under pressure to curb misinformation on their sites in the run-up to the US presidential election in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-removes-misleading-ads-in-voting-related-searches/story-hKHQf03iph9oYfwF3vYIrM.html

30-06-2020||World||‘I did it all’: Ex-police officer pleads guilty to dozens of rapes, 13 murders||A former police officer who terrorized California as a serial burglar and rapist and went on to kill more than a dozen people while evading capture for decades pleaded guilty Monday to murders attributed to the Golden State Killer.Joseph James DeAngelo Jr. had remained almost silent in court since his 2018 arrest until he repeatedly uttered the words “guilty” and “I admit” in a hushed and raspy voice as part of a plea agreement that will spare him the death penalty for a life sentence with no chance of parole.DeAngelo, 74, did not cooperate with authorities, but muttered a confession of sorts after his arrest that cryptically referred to an inner personality named “Jerry” that he said forced him to commit the wave of crimes that appeared to end abruptly in 1986.“I did all that,” DeAngelo said to himself while alone in a police interrogation room after his arrest in April 2018, Sacramento County prosecutor Thien Ho said.“I didn’t have the strength to push him out,” DeAngelo said. “He made me. He went with me. It was like in my head, I mean, he’s a part of me. I didn’t want to do those things. I pushed Jerry out and had a happy life. I did all those things. I destroyed all their lives. So now I’ve got to pay the price.”The day of reckoning had come for DeAngelo, Ho said.“The scope of Joseph DeAngelo’s crimes is simply staggering,” Ho said. ”Each time he escaped, slipping away silently into the night.”There’s no escaping now. DeAngelo, seated in a wheelchair on a makeshift stage in a university ballroom that could accommodate more than 150 observers at a safe distance during the coronavirus pandemic, pleaded guilty to 13 counts of murder and dozens of rapes that were too old to prosecute.The large room at Sacramento State University was made to look like a state courtroom with the seal of the Sacramento County Superior Court behind the judge’s chair and U.S. and state flags on the riser that served as a sort of stage for a daylong proceeding that had a theater-like feel. Large screens flanked the stage so spectators could follow the livestreamed hearing.Temperatures were taken of everyone in the room and even the judge wore a mask when he wasn’t speaking.DeAngelo, who wore orange jail scrubs and a plastic face shield to prevent possible spread of the virus, listed to one side and his mouth appeared agape as prosecutors read graphic details of the crimes, where he raped and killed then snacked before leaving.Family members wept as the proceeding went on most of the day. A pile of used tissues sat on the floor next to Jennifer Carole, whose father, attorney Lyman Smith, was slain in 1980 with his wife, Charlene Smith, who was raped before being killed.“This is much harder than I thought it was going to be. And I thought it was going to be hard,” Carole said. “I feel a lot of anger, which I don’t think I’ve felt so powerfully before.”DeAngelo, a Vietnam veteran and a grandfather, had never been on investigators’ radar until about a decade after the crimes seemed to end. Investigators connected a series of assaults in central and Northern California to slayings in Southern California and settled on the umbrella Golden State Killer nickname for the mysterious assailant.Police used DNA from crime scenes to find a distant relative through a popular genealogy website database then built a family tree that eventually led them to him. They tailed DeAngelo and secretly collected DNA from his car door and a discarded tissue to get an arrest warrant.The retired truck mechanic was arrested at his home in the Sacramento suburbs — the same area he terrorized in the mid-1970s, earning the title East Area Rapist.Prosecutors detailed sadistic acts he committed after slipping into homes undetected and surprising couples in bed by shining a flashlight in their faces and threatening to kill everyone in the house — including young children — if they didn’t follow his orders.The masked prowler initially said he only wanted their money to earn their cooperation. He would have the women bind their husbands or boyfriends face down in bed with shoelaces, and then he would bind the women. Victims described being prodded by the barrel of a gun or the point of a knife.He piled dishes on the backs of men and said they would both be killed if he heard the plates crash while he raped the women.At a home in Contra Costa County in the fall of 1978, he told a woman he would cut her baby boy’s ear off if she didn’t perform oral sex after he had raped her.“I admit,” DeAngelo said after the prosecutor read the description of that crime.He stole whatever he could find, sometimes a few bottles of Budweiser and some cash, other times diamond rings. He slipped off into the dark on foot or by bicycle and even evaded police who at times believed they came close to catching him.DeAngelo knew the territory well.He started on the police force in the San Joaquin Valley farm town of Exeter in 1973, where he is believed to have committed his first break-ins and first killing.DeAngelo was among the officers trying to find a serial burglar in the neighboring city of Visalia responsible for about 100 break-ins.Community college professor Claude Snelling was killed by the suspected “Visalia Ransacker” after trying to prevent him from kidnapping his 16-year-old daughter.After three years on the force, DeAngelo moved back to the Sacramento area, where he worked for the Auburn Police Department in the Sierra foothills until 1979 when he was caught shoplifting dog repellent and a hammer — two items that could be of use to a burglar.DeAngelo killed a couple walking their dog in a Sacramento suburb in 1978, but the majority of murders came after he moved to Southern California.Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer choked up as family members of the victims stood during his description of each of the four killings there. Spitzer, who wiped a tear at one point, diverged from other prosecutors to address DeAngelo directly when discussing the May 5, 1986, rape and slaying of Janelle Cruz, 18 — the final killing.“You attacked her, you beat her and you raped her,” Spitzer said. “You murdered her in the first-degree, bludgeoning her in the face.”A guilty plea and life sentence avoids a trial and even a planned weeks-long preliminary hearing. Victims will be able to confront DeAngelo at length during an August sentencing expected to last several days.Victims began to stand in the audience as accounts of their attacks were read. Nearly two dozen were on the their feet in solidarity as the prosecutor from Sacramento — where most of his sexual assaults took place — detailed each case. They cheered and laughed when Deputy District Attorney Amy Holliday noted victims consistently reported DeAngelo had a small penis.One man, Victor Hayes, who was held at gunpoint while his girlfriend was raped in 1977 shouted out that he wanted his name read aloud.“I’ve been waiting for 43 years. I’m not ashamed of what happened. I’ve never been John Doe in my life,” Hayes said. “I want accountability and accountability starts with my name.”Among the questions that remain is whether DeAngelo actually stopped his life of crime and, if so, why?Ho cast doubt on DeAngelo’s statement in the interrogation room, saying he had “feigned feeble incoherence” to detectives despite appearing sharp while under surveillance. Ho said DeAngelo had acted crazy when he was arrested for shoplifting three decades earlier.James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, said most serial killers do not have dual personalities or inner voices, though movies often portray them that way.He said serial killers who get away with attacks for years are usually cunning and organized.

30-06-2020||World||New swine flu found in China has pandemic potential||Researchers in China have discovered a new type of swine flu that is capable of triggering a pandemic, according to a study published Monday in the US science journal PNAS.Named G4, it is genetically descended from the H1N1 strain that caused a pandemic in 2009.It possesses “all the essential hallmarks of being highly adapted to infect humans,” say the authors, scientists at Chinese universities and China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention.From 2011 to 2018, researchers took 30,000 nasal swabs from pigs in slaughterhouses in 10 Chinese provinces and in a veterinary hospital, allowing them to isolate 179 swine flu viruses. The majority were of a new kind which has been dominant among pigs since 2016.The researchers then carried out various experiments including on ferrets, which are widely used in flu studies because they experience similar symptoms to humans -- principally fever, coughing and sneezing. G4 was observed to be highly infectious, replicating in human cells and causing more serious symptoms in ferrets than other viruses.Tests also showed that any immunity humans gain from exposure to seasonal flu does not provide protection from G4.According to blood tests which showed up antibodies created by exposure to the virus, 10.4 percent of swine workers had already been infected.The tests showed that as many as 4.4 percent of the general population also appeared to have been exposed.The virus has therefore already passed from animals to humans but there is no evidence yet that it can be passed from human to human -- the scientists’ main worry.“It is of concern that human infection of G4 virus will further human adaptation and increase the risk of a human pandemic,” the researchers wrote.The authors called for urgent measures to monitor people working with pigs.“The work comes as a salutary reminder that we are constantly at risk of new emergence of zoonotic pathogens and that farmed animals, with which humans have greater contact than with wildlife, may act as the source for important pandemic viruses,” said James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at Cambridge University.A zoonotic infection is caused by a pathogen that has jumped from a non-human animal into a human.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-swine-flu-found-in-china-has-pandemic-potential/story-9Lz2fjtTb6MRmEF5H56qhN.html
30-06-2020||World||EU finalising virus ‘safe list,’ US unlikely to make the cut||The European Union is edging toward finalising a list of countries whose citizens will be allowed to enter Europe again in coming days, with Americans almost certain to be excluded in the short term due to the number of US coronavirus cases.Spain’s foreign minister said that the list could contain 15 countries that are not EU members and whose citizens would be allowed to visit from July 1. EU diplomats confirmed that the list would be made public on Tuesday. The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because the procedure is ongoing and politically very sensitive.EU envoys in Brussels worked over the weekend to narrow down the exact criteria for countries to be included, mostly centered on their ability to manage the spread of the disease. Importantly, the countries are also expected to drop any travel restrictions they have imposed on European citizens.The number of confirmed cases in the United States has surged over the past week, and President Donald Trump also suspended the entry of all people from Europe’s ID check-free travel zone in a decree in March, making it highly unlikely that U.S. citizens would qualify.Infection rates in Brazil, Russia and India are high, too, and their nationals are also unlikely to make the cut.Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha González Laya said the EU is considering whether to accept travelers from China if Beijing lifts restrictions on European citizens. Morocco is another possibility, although its government doesn’t plan to open borders until July 10.

30-06-2020||World||Egypt hospital fire kills 7 coronavirus patients||An intensive care unit at an Egyptian hospital caught fire on Monday, killing seven COVID-19 patients, according to the country’s public prosecutor. The blaze erupted in the coronavirus ward of a private hospital in Alexandria, along Egypt’s north coast. Six men and one woman were killed, said Gov. Mohamed el-Sharif. The Department of Civil Protection blamed an electric short-circuit for the fire. Police are still investigating but preliminary reports indicate the fire started in the room’s air-conditioner, according to a statement from public prosecutors. After hearing the air-conditioner unit explode, nurses scrambled to stem the flames, but the victims were already overcome by the thick, billowing smoke. “In just seconds, there was a massive fire and none of the workers were able to control the situation because of the rapid spread,” Badrawy Hospital said in a statement. Safety standards and fire regulations are poorly enforced in Egypt and have been linked to many deaths. One patient was injured in the blaze and the rest were evacuated, the prosecutors added. Firefighters doused the blackened remains of ventilators, beds and other medical supplies in the coronavirus ward. The fire did not spread to other parts of the hospital. A similar blaze erupted at a coronavirus isolation centre in the capital, Cairo, last month without causing casualties. The accidents highlight the risks in Egypt’s struggle to fight the virus, which has overwhelmed hospitals in recent weeks. The country lifted a variety of coronavirus restrictions on Saturday, reopening cafes, gyms and clubs, even as its case count soars. On Monday, the Egyptian Health Ministry reported 1,566 infections, including 83 deaths, bringing the total to 66,754 and 2,872 fatalities -- the highest death toll in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-hospital-fire-kills-7-coronavirus-patients/story-DGRRGsdsmtKuOehsoVNmmJ.html

Similar parades were held in a handful of cities in the US and around the world, with attendence reduced due to the coronavirus pandemic.The second annual Queer Liberation March in New York capped a month of Pride events, virtual and live, during which the celebration of LGBTQ lives has merged with the nationwide demonstrations ignited by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month. People chanted “No justice, no peace” as the crowd snaked through Manhattan, while techno music blasted from a pickup truck carrying two DJs, one of whom chanting “Black lives matter.”Taipei, the Taiwanese capital held its annual LGBT Pride parade on Sunday, making it one of the few places in the world to proceed with such an event in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.Participant numbers on Sunday were reduced by both virus concerns and heavy rain. Taiwan’s Central News Agency said that over 1,000 attended. Taiwan is the only place in Asia where same-sex marriage is legal. Hundreds participated in a Gay Pride event in Jerusalem, with numbers limited because of coronavirus rules. Police tried to secure the event that took place just under five years after a person at an LGBT rally was murdered by a Jewish religious extremist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-curtails-most-pride-events-but-some-march-on/story-OTuekb336YhoXRcocO8aoK.html

The investigation report is to be submitted in a month, the statement said.On Monday, a 27-year-old resident of Dhamtari district went to CM’s residence and insisted on meeting chief minister Bhupesh Baghel.

30-06-2020||India||Maharashtra Congress minister says Sharad Pawar should have advised PM Modi instead of Rahul Gandhi on China||Maharashtra Congress leader and a minister in the Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition government in the state, Nitin Raut, has reignited the political controversy around NCP chief and veteran politician Sharad Pawar’s statement reminding the Congress of the 1962 war with China while advising against alleged politicization of the recent Chinese incursions.Sharad Pawar reference to the 1962 war, when large tracts of land were occupied by the Chinese, was widely seen as a sharp disapproval of the Congress party’s continuous allegations that the BJP-led Central government in general and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in particular, had surrendered Indian territory to China by refusing to acknowledge the intrusions across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) since May this year.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has been leading those attacks. since the June 15 violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley, where 20 soldiers were killed along with an unspecified number of Chinese casualties. Also Read: PM Modi’s address to the nation: Congress alleges PM ‘afraid’ of talking about ChinaNitin Raut today attacked Pawar over the statement given last Saturday on June 26.“When China captured our territory in 1962, the situation was different. Sharad Pawar should have rectified his mistakes when he was the defence minister under Congress rule. Instead of commenting on Rahul Gandhi’s remark, he should’ve advised the PM to speak on the issue,” Raut was quoted as having said.The Congress, the NCP are in an alliance with Shiv Sena, which is heading the three-party coalition Maharashtra government and Raut’s remarks against Pawar are relevant in that context.“We can’t forget what had happened in 1962 when China occupied 45,000 square kilometres of India’s territory. While making these allegations, one should also look at what had happened in the past. This is an issue of national interest and once should not bring in politics here,” Pawar had said while answering a question over Rahul Gandhi’s attacks on PM Modi over the issue.Raut’s statement follows a much milder reaction from the state Congress chief and state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat. Thorat, on Sunday, had said that no conclusion should be drawn by using just one of Pawar’s comments and it didn’t amount to “a clean chit” to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the issue.“We lost 20 soldiers in the Galwan valley face off. Yet, PM Modi said there was no intrusion by China. Taking advantage of this Chinese are calling our martyrs as intruders. I am sure that even Pawar saheb is as saddened by this as we are this as are,” Thorat had said.He had added that the Congress party was discharging its responsibility by asking questions on the issues of national interest. He also said that there was no comparison between the 1962 situation and the current clashes with the Chinese army at the LAC.Earlier today, an editorial in Shiv Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana alleged that the Narendra Modi-government was focusing more on responding to Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi instead of giving a befitting reply to China for infiltration and killing Indian soldiers in Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-congress-minister-says-sharad-pawar-should-have-advised-pm-modi-instead-of-rahul-gandhi-on-china/story-NpySGqKt8hpntIDNzzxgTL.html

Their network in this hilly terrain is very strong as compared to the Indian ones who have very poor or often no network.”Singh added, “The villagers who have someone known in Nepal, ask them to arrange a Nepalese SIM card for them on their documents and then receive it here when they come to visit them. It is the only way of communication for any work or emergency.”He said almost everyone in the village has one Nepalese SIM and one Indian SIM card in their phones. “When in the village, we use the Nepalese SIM and when in the market down with a better network, we use the Indian SIM cards.”But not all villagers can access Nepalese SIM cards. “Only those who know people in Nepal are able to get the SIM cards, others fail to get any,” said Raju, another villager.“I don’t have anyone in Nepal, hence I am not able to get any Nepalese SIM card but I wanted one. I have to use the Indian ones only which have a very poor network here. Due to this, we face many problems especially in case of any emergency. This is the reason people here opt for a Nepalese SIM card,” he said. Gopal Singh, head Khumti gram panchayat said, “The Indian service providers started their service here about two years ago only. Before that people used to avail the WLL services only. Despite the starting of their services, the network is very poor. People have to search for its signals by moving in the village for about 2-3 km. Many hang their mobile phones in trees nearby their house to catch the network,” said Singh.Singh also said that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Nepalese SIM cards are now difficult to procure. “As the movement of people has stopped due to the pandemic, the SIM cards are now not available easily. Those who have them, now have to ask their acquaintances in Nepal to recharge their connections.”He said that usually one could get the Nepalese SIM cards of their Namaste Nepal or Sky networks at Rs 150-200. “We have urged the administration to improve the connectivity of Indian networks in the area so that we don’t need to use the Nepalese ones any more, but it is yet to improve,” he said. Experts are divided on the usage of Nepalese SIM cards by the villagers near the border. MS Waldia, a retired Indian army Colonel, termed the use of Nepalese SIM cards and internet by the Indian villagers a ‘dangerous thing’ for nation’s security.“The government needs to take special attention towards the communication needs of border villages in the context of recent adverse behaviour of Nepal towards India,” he said. Ankur Chandrakant, a cyber expert in Uttarakhand, however, claimed that there is no security risk as such by the use of Nepalese SIM cards by Indian villagers.“It can’t pose any security risk as they are being used for normal calling only. But the government should work towards boosting the connectivity in those areas by installing boosters at mobile towers or new towers.”The local public representatives including Dharchula MLA Harish Dhami and Almora MP Ajay Tamta under whose constituency the area falls, are also aware of the issue. Dhami, Congress MLA from Dharchula offered his MLA LAD funds to boost the communication facilities in the area.“I’m ready to give whatever money required to set up the basic infrastructure for the communication at Indo-Nepal and Indo-China border areas”, he said Almora MP Ajay Tamta said mobile phone towers will soon be installed in the region. “Public telecom service provider BSNL is conducting a survey in the area keeping the needs of communication facilities. As soon as the survey gets completed, the work of installing towers will be started,” he said. Vijay Jogdande, district magistrate Pithoragarh said the administration has written to BSNL and even the ministry of defence to take required measures to boost the mobile connectivity. “The final decision has to be taken by them as installing mobile towers or boosters to improve phone connectivity is their prerogative. Once it is done, we can then maintain it later. Meanwhile, we have provided satellite phones in at least 36 gram panchayats in the border areas to connect to the authorities concerned in case of a disaster or emergency,” said Jogdande.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/villagers-near-indo-nepal-border-in-uttarakhand-use-nepalese-sim-cards-to-beat-network-blues/story-7zNKuYk86CyEZ2kPSAk2gO.html

Raheem’s, Mubeen’s and Idrees Biryani fired up their furnaces last Friday. The Old Tunday, which usually serves only beef kababs and parathas, is currently serving only chicken kababs-paratha. “Hopefully, we will soon add our original delicacy to our menu. We are just waiting for the supply to begin,” says the sales boy at the over-100-year-old food joint.Idrees, not linked to any food aggregators, is offering packing and allowing few to dine at its food joint. “We are operating only with the minimum staff just for our regular customers, who were missing our delicacies. Mutton is available but at high prices and dining with social distancing is not feasible, so we are just serving biryani, korma and rumali roti. Tandoori (grilled) and beef items are not available for the moment,” said owner Abu Bakar.Chaat shops, kulfi, street and other vegetarian delights are also back at Chowk crossing. Raj Kumar of Raja Thandai said, “People are very scared. They are not venturing out to eat. I am procuring only one-fourth the pre-Covid days’ milk and that too is not sold in a day. We don’t offer home delivery and are just a dine-in and take-away shop, so whosoever comes to us, can avail our services. It’s a very tough time and when it’s business time in the evening, we start closing. So, we are missing the peak sales time as well.”Mubeen’s Shoeb Ahmed Qureshi seconds him. “People tend to move out in the evening and after 7.30 - 8 pm, and we start closing, as 9 pm is the final deadline. We have cleared out the ground floor and are offering restaurant service only on the first floor with social distancing. Customers are avoiding dining and prefer packing service only. It’s getting tough for us with disposable packing, sanitising cost and other safety precautions to contain the prices.” They have added chicken pasanda and other similar items to make-up for the beef items which are the highest selling dishes at their restaurant.Gomti Nagar resident Mayank Kant had come all the way to Akbari Gate to savour Tunday’s kababs and Mubeen’s beef pasanda. Instead, he had to settle for chicken kababs and chicken pasanda.“Very few people are moving out. We are working with limited staff and outstation staff is yet to return. Also, our menu is very limited and customers are so less. Hope things improve and we return to the old days soon,” wishes Raheem’s Saud Ahmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/slimmer-menus-new-dishes-chowk-bistros-limp-towards-normality/story-wQCBoSPDIGGHzZZWmwtkjL.html
30-06-2020||India||Never claimed Patanjali’s Coronil cures Covid, says Acharya Balkrishna||Acharya Balkrishna, the chief executive officer of Patanjali that was seen to claim a cure for Covid just last week, on Tuesday claimed that the company had never claimed that its newly-tested medicines would treat coronavirus.This reeks of a conspiracy, the company’s chief executive told reporters on Tuesday after the company responded to notices from Uttarakhand’s drug regulatory body. At least one FIR has been filed accusing the company of making misleading claims. The Uttarakhand High Court also issued notice to the Centre on a petition over the claims made by the company on Tuesday.Balkrishna said the company had never claimed to have made a medicine to cure Covid.“We cited Coronil as ayurvedic medicine for immunity boosting, fever, cough and allergic problems,” Balkrishna said. He insisted that the company had only pointed out that the clinical trials indicated that Covid-19 patients, when given this medicine, got cured.“Only results of clinical trial based curing of positive patients were claimed by us,” he said.Balkrishna’s effort to distance himself from the claim and perception is at variance with his Twitter timeline where he had retweeted news reports and congratulatory messages for discovering a medicine that could cure Covid-19. Or the many statements that he and Baba Ramdev had been issuing over the last fortnight.Watch | Never said Coronil can cure Covid patients’: Patanjali CEO Balkrishna “The whole country and the world was waiting for medicine or vaccines for corona. We are proud to announce that the first Ayurvedic, clinically controlled trial based evidence and research-based medicine has been prepared by the combined efforts of Patanjali Research Centre and NIMS,” Yoga Guru Ramdev had said at the press conference on June 23.Also read | ‘All parameters met’: Patanjali claims Coronil clinical trial details furnished to CentreThat claim made headlines in India. But it also drew attention of the regulatory authorities who figured that Patanjali hadn’t taken the requisite clearances from the state or central authorities. The Union Ayush Ministry issued gag orders, prohibiting Patanjali from advertising its claim before the approvals were in place.The first hint about the changing stance of the company had come a day after the company’s announcement about the clinical trials. Uttarakhand’s Ayurveda department had then announced that Patanjali had only applied for a licence to manufacture an immunity booster, and not a cure for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/never-claimed-patanjali-s-coronil-cures-covid-says-acharya-balkrishna/story-jV0gVGrabgFX9PEzjUQa0O.html
30-06-2020||India||Covid-19 casualties in Jammu and Kashmir cross 100||Six Covid-19 patients died in Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday taking the death toll due to the coronavirus infection in the union territory to 101 in 114 days since first cases emerged on March 9.Meanwhile, 260 more people tested positive for Covid-19 taking the tally in the Union Territory to 7,497, officials said. They said that of the six deaths, five were reported in Kashmir Valley and one in Jammu division’s Kathua district.A 23-year-old youth from Shopian and a 65-year-old woman of Srinagar succumbed in Srinagar’s Chest Diseases Hospital while a 53-year-old man from northern district of Baramulla died at Sheri Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Bemina. A 65-year-old Qamarwari man’s sample tested Covid positive after his death at SMHS Hospital. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.“The young man from Shopian was an accident case with a serious head injury and was shifted from SMHS Hospital on Monday. The woman was having multiple ailments including hypertension and diabetes,” said medical superintendent of Chest Diseases Hospital, Dr Saleem Tak.A relative of the Baramulla man said that he tested positive few days back and was very serious. “He had pneumonia and could not survive,” he said. In Jammu division, Kathua district reported its first Covid-19 related death after an 85-year-old woman from Basohli area died at Government Medical College. A doctor said that she was suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and was on oxygen since June 25.Of the total 101 deaths in J&K, 89 have been reported in Kashmir division while 12 were in Jammu division.Dr Nisar ul Hassan,a senior doctor representing a faction of Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK), on Tuesday said Covid-19 is killing more men than women in Kashmir valley. “Nearly 72% of those who died from Covid infection in the valley were men while women accounted for 28% of deaths,” said Dr Nisar ul Hassan. “70 percent of men who died from the novel coronavirus were above 60 years of age and the average age was 62,” he said. Dr Nisar said 86 percent of males who died had preexisting medical conditions with high blood pressure in 18 (28.57%) followed by diabetes in 10 (15. 87%), chronic lung disease in 8 (12.69%), cardiovascular disease in 6 (9.52%), cancer in 4 (6.34%) and chronic kidney disease in 4 (6.34%). Two had brain hemorrhage, one had chronic liver disease and one had hematological condition.“Nine patients (14.28%) had no underlying health issues and they were apparently healthy,” he added.Dr Nisar said the gender disparity in death could be biological or behavioral. “Women have more robust immune system than men and are able to fend off infection. The female sex hormone appears to play a role in immunity, as does X chromosome which contains immune-related genes. Women carry 2 X chromosomes, men only one,” he said.Dr Nisar said men smoke at higher rates than women that damages the lung defense and increases the risk of severe infection. “Males are more likely to have medical conditions that can make Covid-19 infection more fatal in them,” he added.Among the 260 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday were 60 CRPF personnel. A total of 228 of the new cases are from Kashmir and 32 from Jammu division. Among these, 22 patients have a travel history.The number of active cases stands at 2,674 after 137 more patients recovered on Tuesday. The government statement said, “22 people were discharged from Jammu division and 115 from Kashmir.”So far, 4,722 people have been cured in the UT, taking the recovery rate to 62.9 %. Of the total recovered, 3,564 are from Kashmir while 1,158 are from Jammu division.The highest number of active cases is in Srinagar district at 594 followed by 463 in Baramulla , 256 in Pulwama and 234 in Kulgam district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-casualties-in-jammu-and-kashmir-cross-100/story-JAG9UxcwzByEdQxlKxVHvJ.html
30-06-2020||India||Payagipur: This UP village thrives, survives on buffaloes||Whether or not this small village, 35 kilometers from Sangam City, owns the proverbial stick, it surely owns the buffaloes, lots and lots of them.All 3000-odd residents of this village deal in buffalo trade, each house having a wide variety of milch cattle, from the popular Murrah variety to Surti and Jaffarabadi. On any given day, buyers from different parts of Prayagraj and many other districts can be seen striking deals and buying buffaloes here.Welcome to Payagipur, in Saidabad development block, which is better known as ‘village of buffaloes’ and draws buyers from across the state. No one knows exactly when people began trading in buffaloes here, but the village has emerged as a prime supplier of quality buffaloes for the region for around three decades now.“You can find Murrah, Nili Ravi, Surti, Jaffarabadi and Bhadawari breeds of buffaloes, for which one would otherwise need to travel to Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Murrah variety remains the top choice and fetches anywhere from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.5 lakh,” said Sangam Lal Pasi, a buffalo trader from the village.The village residents say that they owe their prosperity to the high-end breed of milch cattle which draw buyers from across the state.“The income from the trade in buffaloes has enabled the villagers to construct pucca houses embellished with all basic amenities and also buy land for farming and own tractors and tube-wells,” said Vijay Pasi, the village pradhan.“Money from buying and selling buffaloes has helped us afford good education for our kids also,” he said.“Today the village attracts buyers from various districts like Bhadoi, Jaunpur, Varanasi, Pratapgarh, Mirzapur and Kaushambi, among others, with annual buffalo trade in the village believed to be worth around Rs 4 crore,” he added.The villagers buy healthy and good breed buffalo calves from select villages and cattle markets of Haryana and Punjab, and then sell them a year or two later as they mature into healthy milch cattle, helping them make big profits.“Every year the buffalo traders in small groups head to different villages and markets of Haryana and Punjab in October-November to buy calves,” said Rajesh Patel, one of the villagers with 20-odd buffaloes.“We buy calves for Rs 20,000 to Rs 40,000 each depending upon the breed and the quality and then transport them in trucks to the village. After proper care and nurturing, these buffaloes sell anywhere between Rs 40,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh each,” he added.“We have around 2,500 buffaloes of varying ages in the village at any given moment. Two thousand litres of milk is produced every day which is sold and utilised locally,” said Pappu Patel, another local trader. Many other traders like Ganga Prasad, Ram Singh, Ram Charan, Lalji and Radheshyam however rued lack of government support to further promote the trade.“Contrary to popular belief, rearing a buffalo calf into a healthy milk-giving buffalo is a tough task and needs good investment. We have to hire private veterinary doctors, bear the cost of medicines and vaccines besides fodder and other care annually and an entire family of the trader has to remain involved. A small vet centre here in the village would be a great help,” they maintained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/payagipur-this-up-village-thrives-survives-on-buffaloes/story-NmiIr5Bc1kI2oF3eUAUgFL.html

30-06-2020||India||Protests planned in 300 world cities as Amaravati agitation nears 200 days||Thousands of non-resident Telugus in the US and other countries are planning demonstrations on July 3 to express their solidarity with the farmers of Amaravati, the present capital city of Andhra Pradesh, as their agitation against the trifurcation of the state capital completes 200 days.More than 24,000 farmers of Amaravati capital region have been on the warpath ever since the YSR Congress Party government in the state, led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, announced on December 17 last year about creating three capitals – executive capital at Visakhapatnam, legislative capital at Amaravati and judicial capital at Kurnool.These farmers belonging to 29 villages - who gave away nearly 34,000 acres of their fertile land to the capital city during the previous Telugu Desam Party regime in 2015 - strongly resisted the move, asserting that they had sacrificed their livelihood in anticipation of the development of a world-class capital city in Amaravati.“For the last 200 days, these farmers have been waging a relentless battle demanding that the capital be retained at Amaravati. They took out rallies, held relay hunger strikes, blocked the national highways and braved arrests and lathi attacks from the police. Some of the farmers died of heart attacks due to psychological pressure,” prominent Telugu businessman Jayaram Komati told HT over the phone from California.Komati, who was former president of Telugu Association of North America (TANA) and former special representative of AP government for North America, said representatives of non-resident Telugu associations in the US had decided to stage demonstrations in as many as 200 cities, in support of the 200 days’ agitation by Amaravati farmers to retain their capital city.“We thought of taking up huge rallies, but because of Covid-19 pandemic, we won’t be able to get permission for the same. So, we decided to restrict our protests by taking out candle-light rallies in these cities to convey our solidarity to the fighting farmers of Amaravati,” Komati said.He said on coming to know about the proposal, Telugus in several other cities had also come forward to hold rallies. “Similarly, Andhra people in other countries like Singapore, Thailand, Australia, England and New Zealand have also evinced interest in similar demonstrations. In all, the protests are likely to take place in 300 cities,” the NRI businessman said.He reminded that the NRIs were not against the Jagan government, but were only demanding that the capital city be retained in Amaravati. “We strongly feel that there should be decentralisation of development, but centralised administration,” he said.The NRI Telugus had contributed to the building of the state capital. When former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu launched a campaign – My Brick, My Amaravati – aimed at selling “electronic bricks” to build Amaravati, they responded in huge numbers.The TANA collected donations from its community members in the US and Canada under ‘My Brick, My Amaravati campaign’ and presented the collected donations to the previous TDP government. More than 2.28 lakh NRI donors purchased nearly 58 lakh bricks sold online, each at a cost of Rs 10.Komati said the Andhra NRIs would continue to help the agitating farmers of Amaravati financially and morally to help them fight a legal battle against the decision to shift the capital. “We shall use all our resources and influences to see that the capital is retained at Amaravati,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protests-planned-in-300-world-cities-as-amaravati-agitation-nears-200-days/story-HxbR376seaU4DvFuU7z48K.html

30-06-2020||India||‘Suggested multiple times’: Congress after PM Modi extends free ration scheme||The Congress on Tuesday sought to take credit for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to extend the free ration scheme for 80 crore people till November-end.Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said the announcement came in response to Sonia Gandhi’s letter to Modi on June 22 in which she had requested him to provide free food grains to the poor for three more months from July in view of the prevailing Covid-19 situation across the country.“It is important to remember that this extension of the scheme was suggested multiple times by the Congress president in her letter to the Prime Minister,” Shrinate said, addressing a virtual news conference.In her letter to the Prime Minister on June 22, Gandhi had also said that millions of Indians are at risk of slipping into poverty due to the strict nationwide lockdown for the past three months.Gandhi had recalled that the provision for supply of 5 kg free food grains per person every month to Antyodaya Anna Yojana and priority households under the National Food Security Act from April-June in addition to regular entitlements was announced at the beginning of the lockdown.The government had also announced free food grains of 5kg per person every month for migrants not covered under any central or state public distribution system (PDS) scheme for May and June.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had in May announced providing 800,000 tonne of emergency ration for migrants under the union government’s Atma Nirbhar Bharat programme for distribution during May and June.“The union government must consider extending the provision for free food grains for a further period of three months i.e. from July-September 2020. Several states have requested for the same,” Gandhi had said.“Nearly three months since the country went into a strict lockdown, millions of Indians are at risk of slipping into poverty. The adverse impact on livelihoods has led to chronic food insecurity for both our urban and rural poor. In light of the current situation, food entitlements must be expanded to address the hunger crisis facing some of the most vulnerable people in the country,” she wrote in the letter.Following Gandhi’s request, the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision-making body, in its meeting on June 23 had called upon the central government to extend the scheme of providing free food grains till September.“The CWC also requests that the special provision for 5kg additional food grain per person per month for migrants not entitled to food grains under any other central or state scheme be extended till September as well,” said a resolution adopted at the meeting.Both Gandhi and the CWC had also urged the government that temporary ration cards may be provided to all those currently not falling in any beneficiary lists so that the widest possible base for these entitlements can be targeted.In a televised address to the nation, Modi announced extension of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), a free ration scheme, for 80 crore people across the country till end of November, costing the exchequer Rs 90,000 crore more.Under the scheme, initially rolled out for three months, five kg of wheat or rice and one kg of pulses per month was to be given free of cost to the poor.The PM also said the government was working on a “one nation, one ration card” initiative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suggested-multiples-times-congress-after-pm-modi-extends-free-ration-scheme/story-TnzhjD1sKrPoVObIxozTuJ.html

The IRCTC hired around 560 supervisors for hospitality in 2018.The decision to end the contracts is currently under reconsideration by the IRCTC board.Several former contractual employees who were handed the termination letter took to social media to seek intervention by railway minister Piyush Goyal.Hospitality supervisors work to monitor the operations of the pantry car on trains and their work includes monitoring, the preparation of food and its quality inspection, handling passengers and their complaints.Regular passenger train services have been suspended since March 22 when the first phase of the lockdown was announced. At present, only 230 special passenger trains are operating.Around 560 supervisors (hospitality) were hired by the IRCTC in 2018 on contractual basis for a period of two years to maintain a quality check on contractors assigned to cater food in trains equipped with pantries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-ending-services-of-500-contractual-workers-railway-says-order-on-hold/story-5yXrWLISMogKg2d05J4cMI.html
30-06-2020||India||46 million girls lost to gender bias: Report||Preference for sons and gender-biased sex selection have led to over 142 million girls missing globally and 46 million girls missing in India, according to a UN flagship report that focuses on gender bias and violence against girls and women, released on Tuesday.In India, around 460,000 girls went missing -- which means they were not born due to sex-selection biases -- each year between 2013 and 2017, said the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) report, The State of the World Population 2020.China (50%) and India (40%) together account for around 90% of the estimated 1.2 million girls lost annually to female foeticide.The report said the economic disruptions and income loss because of the Covid-19 pandemic are likely to increase violence against girls and women. “Covid-19 will exacerbate the unwantedness of daughters and gender discrimination and will have an impact on all harmful practices as families lose income. It is imperative that we take care not to reverse gains of last few decades,” said Argentina Matavel, UNFPA India Representative.The sex ratio at birth in India is 899 girls for every 1,000 boys born during the period 2016 – 18, according to the Sample Registration System Statistical Report 2018, released on Friday. Nine states in the country have sex ratio at birth below 900 [Haryana, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab and Bihar].Globally, one in five girls is married by age 18 and millions of others are subjected to practices that harm them physically, mentally and emotionally, with the knowledge and consent of their families, said the report, titled ‘Against my will: defying the practices that harm women and girls and undermine equality’.The three-most prevalent harmful practices are child marriage, son preference and gender-biased sex selection, and female genital mutilation, according to the report, which lists at least 19 harmful human rights violations against women, ranging from dowry related violence to “honour”. “In India, child marriage is directly linked to poverty, poor education and geographic location, rural versus urban. On the other hand, gender-based sex selection as emerged as a problem among affluent families has today spread across the board,” said Matavel. Investments of $3.4 billion a year through 2030 would help end the suffering of an estimated 84 million girls, the report said.Ending child marriage is possible within the next decade by scaling up efforts to keep girls in school longer and to engage men and boys in social change.The Covid-19 pandemic, however, threatens to reverse progress made in ending these practices. In India, Covid-19 has reduced access to contraception and abortion services, which is likely to lead to an increase in unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions. “The first four months of Covid-19, we estimate that access to 1.85 million abortions was compromised. This is around 47% of the estimated 3.9 million abortions...,” said Vinoj Manning, chief executive officer, Ipas Development Foundation, a non-profit that promotes safe abortion services in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/46-million-girls-lost-to-gender-bias-report/story-QwIqFMfzGmp7wFFtB0qhPJ.html
30-06-2020||India||Say no to testing blood samples for Covid-19||Convalescent plasma therapy to treat coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients got a boost after the Union Ministry of Health Ministry & Family Welfare (MoH&FW) issued revised blood transfusion guidelines to include the collection of convalescent plasma under clinical trials protocol from donors, who have recently recovered from the viral infection.“Systems should be in place to enable re-entry of cured Covid-19 patients, as donors for convalescent plasma for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. The treatment of Covid-19 patients using plasma therapy is under clinical trial and currently, no evidence of the efficacy of the convalescent plasma as a treatment modality for SARS-COV-2, which causes the viral disease, is established… the use of convalescent plasma for routine treatment of Covid-19 patients is not recommended at present…,” stated the ministry guidelines.Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS), a voluntary humanitarian organisation, is working to create a database of potential convalescent plasma donors for dedicated hospitals treating Covid-19 patients.“We are creating a list of eligible convalescent plasma donors that we can share with these hospitals. We need to extensively counsel some of these people, as they themselves were Covid-19 patients, who, at times, are not very comfortable with the idea of going back to a hospital, even if it is to donate plasma. We are also not getting too many inquiries from recovered patients. We are dependent on the hospitals to provide us with the list since we don’t have a hospital of our own,” said Dr. Vanshree Singh, director (blood bank), IRCS.The revised guidelines do not recommend testing of donated blood and blood components for Covid-19 or opting for more advanced Pathogen Reduction Techniques (PRT), citing reasons such as financial impracticality and lack of enough evidence to support transmission through blood transfusion. “Testing of the blood supply for Covid-19 is not recommended in light of the risk of transfusion transmission being theoretical or lack of demonstrated infectivity of the Covid-19 virus in blood collected from asymptomatic persons. Routine practices of infectious disease testing for transfusion transmissible infections should not be changed,” the guidelines stated.“Pathogen Reduction Technologies (PRT) requires significant logistical and financial investment. PRT for whole blood is less widely available and studies of inactivation of coronavirus in whole blood are lacking. The introduction of PRT for the SARS-CoV-2 would not be cost-effective or proportionate and is not recommended,” they added.The document has cited studies that say respiratory viruses are not known to transmit through blood transfusion.“No cases of transfusion-transmission were ever reported for the other two coronaviruses that emerged during the past two decades (SARS and MERS-CoV). Virus detection in blood has only happened in symptomatic patients with Covid-19 to date. American Association of Blood Blanks, USFDA (US Food and Drug Administration) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States of America) are not recommending any additional action by blood collection establishments at this time because there are no data or precedent suggesting the risk of transfusion-transmission for Covid-19… According to the USFDA, there have been no reported or suspected cases of transfusion-transmitted Covid-19,” the experts, who drafted the guidelines, stated.However, the government has asked blood banks to screen donors thoroughly for Covid-19 related symptoms, and discard or recall the donated blood, if there was even slightest suspicion of any strain of the virus. The donors will have to wait for at least 28 days before they are eligible again. People, who cannot donate blood, are laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms; contacts of a laboratory positive case or those with travel history to a country where community transmission of the viral disease is established. “The blood samples collected from a donor, who turns out to be Covid-19 positive, or is an unconfirmed case or even a close contact of a laboratory positive case within 28 days of donation, will be discarded. All known positive cases cannot donate for 28 days after the end of 7 day home isolation post-discharge or when symptoms subside, or travel to a Covid-19 affected country,” the guidelines stated.Dr. RN Makroo, president, Indian Society of Transfusion Medicine, said thorough screening is a must. “For regular donors, a thorough screening of the history of the person is good enough. You cannot conduct a blood test or PRT, which is not just very expensive but is also not available in India. We must strengthen the screening of our regular donors that’s the only solution. The new guidelines are pretty comprehensive and they should be followed in letter and spirit,” said Dr. Makroo. “Though The government guidelines insist on a 28-day of deferral, we go by six weeks. It is better to be safe than sorry,” said Dr. Singh from IRCS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/revised-transfusion-guidelines-include-convalescent-plasma-donation-say-no-to-screening-donors-for-covid-19/story-fSiUhR6ZZBmn2i0DjvHTjJ.html
30-06-2020||India||Tamil Nadu pushes Gujarat to 2nd spot in annual fish production||Tamil Nadu has overtaken Gujarat to occupy the top spot in annual fish production even as the country’s marine production registered a marginal increase of 2.1% in 2019 compared to the previous year, the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) has said. Recurring cyclonic storms and netting of huge quantities of non-edible fish items are main reasons for relatively low catch last year, said the premier marine research body headquartered in Kochi. The country netted a total of 3.56 million tonne last year (in 2018, it was 3.49 m t), said the annual marine fish landing report of the CMFRI. Tamil Nadu grabbed the first position with 7.75 lakh tonne followed by Gujarat (7.49 lakh t), which was numero uno for many years while Kerala (5.44 lakh t) retained its third position. Another major highlight of the study is that Indian mackerel, which was in the first spot in 2018, suffered a setback with its landings declining by 43% and the slot was occupied by red- toothed triggerfish (2.74 lakh t) which has little demand in domestic market and is mostly caught for feeding mills. Ribbon fish (2.19 lakh t) is in second spot followed by cephalopod (2.18 lakh t). Oil sardine, cheap and best, is not in the first five slots.While states like West Bengal (55%), Andhra Pradesh (34%), Odisha (14.5%), Karnataka (11%) and Tamil Nadu (10.4%) recorded increase in landings, catch decreased in Maharashtra (32%), Goa (44%) and Kerala (15.4%) compared to the previous year. Kerala suffered a significant drop of 15.4% in landings during the last year with a total landing of 5.44 lakh tonnes. Sharp decline in the catch of oil sardine and mackerel, the two major resources in the state, contributed to poor landings, said the report.The CMFRI said eight cyclonic storms in and around the country last year of which six were severe cyclones (Fani in April, Vayu in June, Hika in September, Kyarr in October, Maha in Oct-Nov and Bulbul in Oct-Nov) affected the fishing calendar, especially affecting the western coast badly.The estimated value of fish landings in the country last year was Rs 60,881 crore with 15.6% increase over 2018. The Fishery Resources Assessment Division of the CMFRI estimated the annual marine fish landings through its online data collection system, said CMFRI Director Dr A Gopalakrishnan. In world marine fish production the country is ranked third after China and Indonesia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-pips-gujarat-to-2nd-spot-in-annual-fish-production/story-KTRXwH1uJfN2B1HaXXDuhK.html

30-06-2020||India||Nepal Communist Party leaders demand PM Oli’s resignation||New Delhi: Several top leaders of the ruling Nepal Communist Party, including Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, on Tuesday demanded the resignation of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on the grounds that he had failed to provide effective leadership.Prachanda, Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal were among the leaders who called on Oli to step down during a meeting of the standing committee of the Nepal Communist Party in Kathmandu, members of the party were quoted as saying by the Nepalese media.The leaders sought Oli’s resignation because “he had failed to run the government”, The Kathmandu Post reported. The website of Kantipur newspaper reported 17 of the 18 leaders who spoke at the meeting, held at Oli’s official residence, demanded that he resign as both prime minister and chairman of the party.The development came just two days after Oli had on Sunday accused India and politicians in Nepal of being involved in a conspiracy to topple him for publishing the country’s new map that depicts Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepalese territory.India has controlled these territories for decades, and Nepal’s claim had worsened relations between the two sides. Oli is facing intense criticism within the Nepal Communist Party for his governance and handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and many believed he had created the bogey of a coup and raised a nationalistic issue such as the new map to remain in his position.During Tuesday’s meeting, several leaders demanded that Oli should provide proof of the attempts being made to topple him, The Kathmandu Post quoted an unnamed standing committee member as saying.Media reports said Prachanda too asked Oli to show evidence to back up his comments that the Indian government and leaders of the Nepal Communist Party were engaged in efforts to remove him over the new map. The reports further said Prachanda told the meeting that he, and not the Indian government, was seeking Oli’s resignation.Prachanda’s demand was backed by senior leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal, the reports said.Oli’s remarks on Sunday about activities in Kathmandu to remove him from his post were seen as being aimed at other leaders of the Nepal Communist Party, including Prachanda, Nepal and Khanal, who have been critical of his governance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-communist-party-leaders-demand-pm-oli-s-resignation/story-NF2Feu1gDwV4zccmP8ujnO.html
30-06-2020||India||Glass shields, bamboo sticks in voting proposals before EC for Bihar polls||Toothpick-sized bamboo sticks for contactless voting, glass shields at the table of polling officers, use of disposable syringes to mark voters’ fingers are some of the proposals the Election Commission is working on for yet-to-be announced Bihar polls amid the coronavirus pandemic that continues to be a cause for concern.The polls, first since the coronavirus outbreak, are expected to be held in October-November and pose a big challenge for the authorities.EC officials, while rationalising the proposals, said the idea of putting indelible ink through disposable syringes is a safe option as the syringes could be disposed after one use where as glass shields before polling officers is required so that there is less chances of any infection from voter to polling staff and vice-versa during the identification exercise of the voter.“Even gloves and bamboo made small sticks are being advocated for use of EVMs to press the buttons and sign the voter register as it will help in contactless voting. Sanitising the EVMs after every vote is not possible. We are not using any plastic made items because there is scope of infection in it. Bamboo made sticks are environment friendly and disposable also,” said a senior EC officer requesting anonymity.Sources said the proposals have been sent by the chief electoral officer, Bihar, to the EC for final approval. “We have sent a few proposals for safety of voters at the booths. We are working on it. Our objective is that voters do not come in contact with any physical substance and there is a contactless method of voting during the polls,” said CEO, Bihar, HR Srinivasa.However, the implementation is likely to pose its own logistical challenges. The state has a total of 7.18 crore voters with 1.06 lakh booths and the requirement of maintaining social distancing further adds another complexity to the whole exercise.EC officials claimed the process has begun with priority being given to requisition gloves from Bihar State Khadi board so that it generates rural employment and easy availability of the protective gear. “The state khadi board has been asked to work on it to provide khadi gloves.Other materials would be purchased locally for which DMs and district election officers will be authorised to do so,” said another EC officer aware of the developments.Meanwhile, state political parties are divided in their opinion about the new steps.While the BJP and JD(U), constituents of the ruling NDA, said they will support any such measure by the EC for ensuring safety of voters, opposition RJD said they are against such a move as it would infringe on the right of voters and defeat the purpose of elections.“If the EC takes any steps for the safety of voters in view of Covid-19, we will support. But our thinking is that all steps of safety to be taken by the poll panel should be widely publicised as our larger objective is that there should be 100% voting and all voters should exercise their franchise freely,” said Nikhil Anand, state spokesperson of the BJP.JD(U) state spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan said the party would support steps that the poll panel takes for safety of voters.“We are in favour of safety measures for voters,” he said.RJD’s senior leader and state spokesperson Shakti Singh Yadav, however, said the proposals are totally out of sync with the interest of voters.“In the name of Covid, there is an attempt being made to manipulate the polls. We will oppose any such moves of the EC to provide gloves or sticks. We want the EC to conduct polls like in the past by using laid down procedures. Even in South Korea, elections were held during Covid-19 pandemic by using ballot papers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/glass-shields-bamboo-sticks-in-voting-proposals-before-ec-for-bihar-polls/story-JkCYHpmbv7rwkGy7h3v7UM.html

30-06-2020||India||Nepal PM’s attack on India backfires, chorus for his exit becomes louder at party meet||Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who had last week blamed India for his mounting troubles, on Tuesday faced a sharp attack from top leaders of the ruling Nepal Communist Party who demanded that the prime minister step down immediately, according to news agency ANI.PM Oli had last week accused New Delhi of orchestrating efforts to topple him in an effort to put the rival faction led by co-chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal on a back foot. PM Oli, speaking at an event on Sunday, had claimed that his rivals were trying to pull the rug from under his feet because he had brought out a new political map that had upset Nepal’s giant neighbour. But this attempt appeared to have backfired.At the party’s 44-member standing committee meeting on Tuesday, local media reports quoted communist party leaders such as Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Madhav Nepal, Jhala Nath Khanal and Bamdev Gautam stepping up their pitch to seek his removal. They have argued that the Oli-led government had failed to deliver on basic governance issues and was blaming India to divert attention, according to a report in the website of newspaper The Himalayan Times.Also Read: Nepal extends lockdown to July 22“As things progressed, party co-chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal asked PM Oli to quit owing to the government’s gross, all-round incompetence, according to a source close to Dahal. Many NCP (NCP) leaders came down heavily on PM Oli for failing to deliver as well as for applying diversion tactics to fend off criticisms,” the Himalayan Times report on its website said.Local media reports said PM Oli’s rival faction is “hell bent” to force him to either quit the Prime Ministerial post or the position of party co-chair. eKantipur, another news website suggested that PM Oli tried to brush aside calls for his resignation, repeating his allegation about New Delhi’s role.Also Read: How Nepal’s PM is harming tiesPushpa Kamal Dahal, better known by his nom de guerre ‘Prachanda’, slammed Oli.“The Prime Minister’s remarks that India was conspiring to remove him was neither politically correct, nor diplomatically appropriate,” Prachanda said, according to news agency PTI. “Such a statement by the Prime Minister may damage our relations with the neighbour,” he warned.PM Oli had last month unveiled Nepal’s new map that made fresh territorial claims on India’s Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura region. Analysts in Kathmandu and New Delhi had interpreted his government’s hard push to the map to be an effort to whip up ultra-nationalistic sentiments against India. PM Oli’s rivals within and without the party played along with him to accord parliamentary approval to the new map but revived the campaign for his ouster soon after.Also Read: India’s ties with Nepal set for deep freeze after Kathmandu’s decisive step on new mapIndia has rejected Nepal’s claim as “untenable” and described it as an “artificial enlargement” of the territorial claims. It has also maintained that New Delhi values its friendly relations with Nepal and its people.Three days ago, Communist party president Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda had demanded Oli’s resignation while questioning his attempt to pass on the blame to New Delhi. On Monday, Nepal foreign minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali had said that the government hoped that the territorial dispute between India and Nepal would be resolved through diplomatic efforts and that it should not impact other dynamics of the bilateral ties, as reported by PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-pm-kp-oli-asked-to-leave-during-party-meeting-he-blames-india/story-rcIG7KWvojQ2GopU2HXEyM.html

Still we are not able to cope with the tremendous pressure on the transport system for the intra-city movement,” the Bengal government wrote in its letter to the ministry of home affairs. It noted that the worst sufferers in the present scenario are the people associated with essential services like medical and health staff, police personnel, among others.“Approach you with a request to kindly give MHA’s consent for relaxing the norms for Kolkata for running a bare minimum number of Metro rail just to carry these personnel as a very special case,” the government said further.

On average, over 1,240 tests were done per day with an average of 66 Covid-19 positive cases and 64 recoveries during the past one month,” said Nautiyal.The state government has also gradually opened up economic activities by easing of lockdown restrictions and allowing offices and markets to operate. Pilgrims from the state have also been allowed to visit Char Dham.On June 8, the government had issued unlock guidelines for hotels, homestays, religious places, and shopping malls to reopen. The guidelines, issued by state chief secretary Utpal Kumar Singh, had allowed the hotels and homestays to open but prohibited them from taking bookings from visitors hailing from 31 high-viral load Covid-19 cities across the country. It also barred hotels and homestays to reopen that are located in the containment zones and under the jurisdiction of Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC). The guests from non-high-viral load Covid-19 cities were allowed to stay for a minimum period of seven days but barred from visiting public places and tourist spots. The government also for the first time capped the number of pilgrims allowed to visit the Char Dham shrines and released a standard operating procedure (SOP) for pilgrims on June 9. Only residents from the districts, where the temples are situated, were allowed.However, all residents from the state have been allowed to visit the shrines from Wednesday (July 1).Ravinath Raman, chief executive officer (CEO), Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board, said that people from across the state would be allowed to visit the shrines following certain guidelines. However, anyone staying in a containment or buffer zone would not be allowed to enter any of the shrine premises. Anyone with symptoms similar to Covid-19 would not be allowed to undertake any pilgrimage, he added.On June 16, the government had amended the norms and made violations such as not wearing face masks in public places and any violence perpetrated against health workers and damage to the public property a punishable offence under The Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020. Around 15,000 people have been booked for not wearing face-masks in public places and over 2,000 for the violation of social distancing norms in June, said Ashok Kumar, director-general, (law & order), Uttarakhand Police. Anyone found not wearing a face mask or not maintaining social distancing in a public place could face a jail term of up to six months and a fine of Rs 5,000.On June 19, the government had decided to double the fare for both state-run Uttarakhand Road Transport Corporation and private buses. The government raised the fare citing losses by bus operators amid criticism from the opposition.The main opposition, Congress, termed the decision “against the common man and a systematic loot”.On June 25, the government had announced a one-time payment Rs 1,000 each to Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) and Anganwadi workers as frontline Covid-19 warriors battling against the viral outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unlock-1-0-a-mixed-bag-for-uttarakhand/story-3cvpAXxZEq6GaKvbm99HOJ.html
30-06-2020||India||PM Modi’s address to the nation. Complete text||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday addressed the nation as India gears up to enter Unlock 2.0 from July 1 against Covid-19 crisis. During his short address, sixth since the coronavirus pandemic took over in March, the prime minister entirely focussed on India’s Covid battle and the steps the government took to minimise the impact of the crisis.Here’s the complete text of PM Modi’s address:My dear countrymen, namaskar!We are now entering Unlock-Two in our fight against the corona pandemic. We are also entering the season of increasing cases of cough, cold and fever. I, therefore, request all of you to take special care of yourselvesFriends, considering corona’s death rate, India is comparatively in a better position compared to many countries of the world. Timely imposition of lockdown and other decisions have saved lakhs of lives. But we have also seen that since Unlock-One, there is increasing negligence in personal and social behaviour. Earlier, we were very careful with respect to wearing of masks, social distancing and washing of hands for 20 seconds. But today, when we need to be more careful, increasing negligence is a cause of worry.Friends, rules were followed very strictly during the Lockdown. Now governments, local bodies, citizens, need to show similar alertness. Especially, we need to focus more on containment zones. Those not following the rules will need to be stopped and cautioned. You must have seen in the news, Prime Minister of a country was fined Rs. 13,000 for not wearing a mask in public place. In India too, the local administration should work with the same enthusiasm. This is a drive to protect the lives of 130 crore countrymen. Be it a village pradhan or the Prime Minister, no one is above the law in IndiaFriends, nation’s top priority during the lockdown was to ensure that no one remains hungry. Central government, state governments, civil society, all did their best... to ensure that no one goes to bed hungry. Be it a nation or a person, timely and sensible decisions increase our power to fight any crisis. Thus, immediately after the lockdown, the government brought out the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana. Under this scheme, a package worth Rs. 1.75 lakh crore was provided for the poor.Friends, in the last three months, 20 Crore poor households have received direct benefit transfers worth Rs. 31,000 Crore. During this period, Rs. 18,000 crore have been deposited in bank accounts of over 9 Crore farmers. Simultaneously, Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan was quickly launched for employment of Shramiks in rural areasGovernment is spending Rs. 50,000 Crore on this.Friends, there is another big thing that has surprised the whole world. In India, over 80 crore people were given free ration for three months. It means, every member of the family was given 5 kilogram wheat or rice, free of cost. In addition, every family got one kilogram pulse per month, free of cost. In a way, over 2.5 times the population of the United States, 12 times the population of the United Kingdom and double the population of the European Union was given free ration by our government.Friends, today, I am making a big announcement related to this. Friends, in our country, there are many activities in agriculture during and after rainy season. Other sectors do not have much activity. July also marks beginning of the festive season. 5th July is Guru Purnima, then month of Saawan is starting. Then 15th August is coming, Raksha Bandhan, Sri Krishna Janmashtami,Ganesh Chaturthi, Onam will follow. Further, Kati Bihu, Navratri, Durga Puja is coming, then Dussera, Diwali and Chhath. This festive season increases necessities as well as expenditure. Keeping all these things in mind, it has been decided to extend Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana up to Diwali and Chhath Puja, till November-end.It means, this scheme giving free ration to 80 crore people will continue in July, August, September, October, November. Government will provide free ration to 80 crore poor brothers-sisters for five months. Every member of family will get five kilogram wheat or rice. Also, every family will get one kilogram whole chana per month, free of cost.Friends, over 90 thousand crore rupees will be spent on this extension of PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana. If we add expenditure of last three months on this scheme, then it comes to around 1.5 lakh crore rupees.We have seen a dream for the whole country and some states have really done well. We are requesting other states also totake it forward. And, what is that?Now, One Nation, One Ration card is also being implemented. Major beneficiaries of this will be those who go to other states, in search of employment.Friends, today, if the government is able to provide free ration to the needy and poor, then credit for it goes to two categories. One – hard working farmers of our country. Second – honest taxpayers of our country. It is your hard work and dedication, due to which the nation is able to do it. You have filled the stocks of the nation, therefore, there is food in kitchen of poor, workers.You paid the tax honestly, you fulfilled your duty. That is why, the poor of the country is successfully coping with such a big crisis. On behalf of all the poor of the country, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the taxpayers and farmers, and also salute them.Friends! In the coming days, we will further strengthen our efforts and continuously work to empower the poor, downtrodden and deprived sections of society. While taking all the precautions, we will further expand the Economic Activities. We will work ceaselessly for Atmanirbhar Bharat. We all will be vocal for Local. With this pledge and commitment, the 130 crore people of this country will have to work together and move forward together.I once again request you, pray for your, and appeal to you, that you all remain healthy, maintain a distance of two yards, always use your ‘Gamchha’, Face cover and mask. Please, do not be careless.With this appeal, best wishes to all of you!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-address-to-the-nation-complete-text/story-pWz8lPwjANttEsMd47YDZI.html

Our security forces have foiled their sinister designs and will keep doing so,” he told reporters after reviewing the security scenario along the Line of Control (LoC) and in the hinterland in Poonch.Singh said that the anti-terror operations are on at full throttle in Kashmir and 128 terrorists have been eliminated by the security forces so far this year.“In Kashmir region 48 terrorists have been eliminated this month. Till June the security forces have eliminated 128 terrorists, out of whom 70 belonged to Hizbul Mujahideen, 20 each from Jaish-e-Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Toiba and remaining from other groups,” he said.The DGP further informed that the two terrorists killed in an operation in Bijbehara on Tuesday were the ones involved in the killing of a five-year-old boy and a CRPF jawan on Sunday.“Similarly, in Acchabal operation we eliminated the last militant of Doda district and have made the region terror free for now,” he added.He said security forces have been successful in eliminating militants in large numbers in South Kashmir.“And the positive development is that the naïve and gullible youth, who used to be brainwashed by the terrorists and their OGWs are not taking up arms. Their number has come down drastically. They have been motivated by their families and security forces to lead a normal and productive life,” said the DGP.He said that among the new recruits from South Kashmir only 24 remain active and they will be dealt with accordingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terror-launch-pads-across-loc-active-but-we-are-ready-says-j-k-dgp/story-Z8aGWLkvwTaCoaAKDMByIO.html
30-06-2020||India||PM Modi’s address to the nation: Congress alleges PM ‘afraid’ of talking about China||The Congress has expressed its disappointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the nation on Tuesday, where he announced an extension to the PM Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana for free distribution of food grains to the poor till the end of November.The Congress party questioned why the PM didn’t address the issue of Chinese incursions. “Forget condemning China, the PM is too afraid to even talk about it in his national address,” a tweet on Congress party’s official handle said, a few minutes after the prime minister’s address finished.The highlight of the prime minister’s address was the extension to PM Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana at the cost of over Rs 90 thousand crore. Under this scheme, the central government provides free ration to 80 crore poor people, he said.“Every member of the family will get 5 kg wheat or rice. Also, every family will get one kilogram whole chana per month, free of cost,” the prime minister said announcing the extension to the scheme launched especially to help the poor deal with the economic hardships inflicted by the lockdown in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic outbreak.The Congress seemed to suggest that today’s address could have been avoided.“Another national address that could have been a Govt notification,” the party said in another tweet preceding the one related to the Chinese incursion question.Also Read: Respond to China, not Opposition parties, Shiv Sena tells Modi govtThe Congress has been demanding that the prime minister clarifies on his earlier remark on China made during the all party meet. The party has attacked the prime minister ever since alleging that he had denied the incidents of Chinese intrusion across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh in contradiction with his own government’s official statements confirming the occupation of Indian territory by the Chinese army.Also Read: ‘No one above the law’: PM Narendra Modi asks for confronting Covid-19 norms’ violatorsEarlier today, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to explain how he proposes to drive Chinese troops out of Ladakh.“The whole country knows that China has snatched India’s land. We all know the Chinese are at four places in Ladakh. Please tell the country how you will evict the Chinese troops and when?” he asked in a video address barely an hour before the Prime Minister’s address to the nation.Also Read: When will you evict Chinese troops from Ladakh?

30-06-2020||India||Respond to China, not Opposition parties, Shiv Sena tells Modi govt||The Shiv Sena took on the Narendra Modi-government and said that instead of giving a befitting reply to China for infiltration and killing Indian soldiers in Ladakh, the government is focusing on responding to Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. An editorial the Sena mouthpiece Saamana said that the Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress war of words is on at a time with China is building its army on the border. It added that “like the ‘coronavirus caller tune’, somebody should run a tune that ‘we have to fight China and not opposition parties’.The Sena also took potshots at Union home minister Amit Shah and said that he should focus on combating Covid-19 and not pay attention to what the opposition parties are saying on China.“The Chinese troops infiltrated in Galwan valley and it is carrying out unauthorised construction. Instead of giving China a befitting reply, the government is giving a strong response to Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and the Congress party. Rajiv Gandhi Foundation got funds from China. On this, the Congress shot back saying PM Cares got funds worth crores from Chinese companies. The Chinese are building bunkers and tents at the border and here BJP-Congress spat is on. It seems we have forgotten that we have to fight the Chinese,” the editorial said.The Shiv Sena backed Rahul Gandhi for questioning the government on the violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops that left 20 Indian soldiers dead earlier this month. “Who is indulging in politics [over the Chinese infiltration]? Rahul Gandhi’s questions are not just bubbles in the water. Perhaps, Sharad Pawar also has the same queries. If China hasn’t intruded on our land, why were the 20 soldiers martyred?” it asked.Referring to Shah’s comments that the country will win battles against Covid-19 and against China under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, the Sena said, “We wish Mr. Shah the best. He should focus on the two battles. The government should not focus on the opposition party. There is no need to be rattled by questions raised by the opposition party.”It added that there is no need to debate what happened in 1962 and said that we should “forget the past” and tackle the “fresh crisis”. it added, “Whether it was Nehru or Modi, China will never change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/respond-to-china-not-opposition-parties-shiv-sena-tells-modi-govt/story-xSncr3v5clNsFfJno7NhHL.html

We all know the Chinese are at four places in Ladakh. Please tell the country how you will evict the Chinese troops and when?” he asked in a video address barely an hour before the Prime Minister’s address to the nation.The Congress has been attacking the Prime Minister over inconsistencies on the government’s stand on the position of Chinese troops in Ladakh. Last week, the opposition party had asked Modi to “publicly condemn China’s brazen act in Ladakh.” Modi has not yet named China amid the standoff.The Indian Army has been bracing itself for all eventualities in Ladakh and has deployed battle tanks in the Galwan Valley sector where 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash with Chinese troops on the night of June 15 that triggered a national outrage.Senior military commanders from India and China are meeting in Chushul on Tuesday to hammer out a disengagement protocol.On Monday, the government banned 59 China-lined mobile phone apps saying they were prejudicial to India’s sovereignty, security, defence and public order.

30-06-2020||India||China main issue for Cong, BJP for by-polls to 24 assembly seats in MP||The stand-off at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China has become a political issue for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress ahead of the elections to the 24 assembly constituencies, which hold key to the party that would form the government in Madhya Pradesh. The BJP has 107 legislators and Congress 92 in the assembly. The party with 116 legislators would have the majority in 230-member house.The BJP has announced it will go from door- to - door to tell people how the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation received a donation from China and how the then Union commerce and industries minister Kamal Nath played a key role in building the relationship between China and the Congress party.The allegations have prompted Congress to raise the issue of the visit by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and other state and central BJP leaders to China in the past and Chouhan accepting hospitality of the Chinese Communist Party.On Sunday, BJP leaders burnt effigies of state Congress president Kamal Nath in two places in Bhopal.“Congress stands exposed after donations to Rajiv Gandhi Foundation. In the capacity of union commerce and industries minister Kamal Nath had reduced import duty from 40% to 200% on 250 items that benefitted China and hard hit those who were engaged in small trades in the country,” VD Sharma, the BJP’s state unit chief, said. Sharma reiterated the charges the party’s national vice-president Prabhat Jha had levelled on Friday.Bhupendra Gupta, the Congress’ state unit spokesperson, said the party will expose the “real face of the BJP” in context with its relations with China and it would “definitely be one of the main issues during the by-polls.”“Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan visited China twice during his previous term as the CM. Once he accepted the hospitality of the Communist Party. The fact is the BJP has been trying to build a good relationship with China since 2009 when it sent a delegation and again in 2014 to understand the working of the Communist Party over there. These delegations had certain people with Sangh background too,” Gupta said.Even otherwise, he said, “During the BJP regime import from China has gone up three folds. In this situation, the BJP must make it clear as to who is an agent of China- BJP or Congress?”Political analyst Girija Shankar said the BJP and Congress are picking up “non-issues”.“Though the BJP and Congress both are making massive preparations for the by-polls, neither of these two parties has raised any real issue concerning the people so far. Since both the parties are cut-off from the ground reality, they are raising non-issues like China with an eye on by-polls,” Shankar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-main-issue-for-congress-bjp-for-by-polls-to-24-assembly-seats-in-madhya-pradesh/story-WNH5ihMshZ875LiE3FXzVL.html

He also directed that detailed planning for such large scale vaccination should be undertaken immediately.The status of Indian and global vaccine development efforts was also reviewed at the meeting. The PM underscored India’s responsibility and commitment to the global community to play an enabling role in global vaccination efforts against Covid-19.“The PM noted that vaccination of India’s vast and diverse population will need to factor in issues including those related to management of medical supply chains, prioritization of at-risk populations, coordination between different agencies involved in the process, as well as the role of private sector and civil society in this national endeavour,” an official statement said.PM Modi outlined the four guiding principles that would form the foundation of this national effort.First, that vulnerable groups should be identified and prioritized for early vaccination, for example doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, non-medical frontline corona warriors, and vulnerable people among the general population; second, that vaccination of “anyone, anywhere” should take place, ie without imposition of any domicile related restrictions for getting the vaccine; third, that vaccination must be affordable and universal - no person should be left behind; and fourth, that the entire process from production to vaccination should be monitored and supported in real time with the use of technology.PM-CARES (Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations) Fund Trust had earlier allocated Rs 100 crore for coronavirus vaccine development.India’s coronavirus count has reached 5,66,840 including 16,893 deaths, according to the Union health and family welfare ministry on Tuesday. Earlier, Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech announced that it has successfully developed Covaxin, the country’s first vaccine candidate for Covid-19, in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology (NIV).The Drug Controller General of India, ministry of health & family welfare granted permission to initiate phase I & II human clinical trials after the company submitted results generated from preclinical studies, demonstrating safety and immune response.Human clinical trials are scheduled to start across India in July 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-reviews-preparations-for-covid-19-vaccine-development/story-XJzz66sXFRUraiXVAUVwmI.html

The ban was fast-tracked by Home Minister Amit Shah after the June 15 violent confrontation between soldiers of India and China at eastern Ladakh’s Galwan valley that spiralled tensions between the two neighbours.The official announcement only said the 59 applications were prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order. “This move will safeguard the interests of crores of Indian mobile and internet users,” the Indian IT ministry statement on Monday evening said. Also Watch | Chinese apps banned: Alternatives to TikTok, CamScanner, ES File ExplorerChinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Beijing was strongly concerned about the order.“China is strongly concerned about the relevant notice issued by the Indian side.

The reasons given for the removal of the posts include divulging state secrets and endangering national security.The updates published on WeChat included Modi’s remarks on the India-China border situation, the phone call between the Indian and Chinese foreign ministers held earlier this month and a statement by the external affairs ministry’s (MEA) spokesperson on the border situation.India’s decision to ban the China-linked apps and encourage people to use Indian applications is a continuing effort to reduce dependence on its neighbor’s products and hampers efforts by China’s largest corporations to expand beyond their own borders||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-in-india-s-interest-china-after-ban-on-tiktok-58-other-apps/story-5Sh0gLXhuQUhcnOkS0ZyiL.html

Arif Sheikh, Raipur’s superintendent of police, said the man, identified as Hardev Sinha, a resident of Dhamtari district, went to Baghel’s residence and insisted on getting inside. “Suddenly, he poured petrol on himself which he was carrying in a small bottle and set himself on fire,” Sheikh said while speaking to HT. Police sources said the reason behind Sinha’s action could have stemmed from his inability to make a YouTube film. They added that Sinha was a writer and had given an application to the village panchayat for making a YouTube film. Chhattisgarh public relations department, on the other hand, claimed after speaking to his relatives that Sinha, a native of Telinsatti village, has been mentally unstable for the past two years. “Sinha owns 2 acres of land in his village and possesses a job card under the employment guarantee scheme. He even had worked for 11 days last month in works under the scheme and had given an application to village panchayat for making a YouTube film,” it said in a statement. Hardev Sinha has two daughters and a wife, who works as a labourer. His wife, Basanti Sinha, while speaking to the media said that Hardev was not mentally unstable but remianed in constant worry over how he would feed his children and his family. Sheikh said Sinha is currently admitted to Dr BR Ambedkar Memorial Hospital. He sustained 40% burn injuries but remains out of danger.“As per preliminary investigation, Sinha is mentally unstable and was also undergoing some treatment,” he said.Chief minister Baghel prayed for speedy recovery of Sinha and asked people not to take such extreme steps. The BJP criticised the role of the chief minister and party leader Dr Raman Singh took to Twitter on Tuesday to ask his successor if the incident highlights the Congress government’s failure to address problems suffered by the state’s youth. Singh, in a series of tweets, also asked Congress lawmaker Rahul Gandhi to consider the removal of Baghel as a chief minister over the incident. मुख्यमंत्री @bhupeshbaghel आज प्रदेश की जनता हरदेव सिन्हा की इस दशा को आपकी विफलता माने या सफलता? https://t.co/szyi6EqPez pic.twitter.com/qwNjNYg6fKछत्तीसगढ़ आकर झूठे वादे करने वाले @RahulGandhi अब कहाँ हैं? आपके वादों पर विश्वास करने वाले युवाओं को विश्वासघात की आग में धकेलने वाले मुख्यमंत्री को क्या अब भी आप पद पर रहने देंगे?He also quoted the famous Hindi poet Adam Gondvi in a separate tweet and lashed out at Baghel’s administration, saying Sinha’s plight is symbolic of the hopelessness that Chhattisgarh’s youth faces under the new government. जिस्म क्या है रूह तक सब कुछ ख़ुलासा देखियेआप भी इस भीड़ में घुस कर तमाशा देखियेजो बदल सकती है इस पुलिया के मौसम का मिजाज़उस युवा पीढ़ी के चेहरे की हताशा देखिये।- अदम गोंडवीVishnu Deo Sai, the BJP’s chief of the state unit, said the government has not kept its promise of providing the unemployment allowance, a promise it had made ahead of the assembly polls.“This is a heart-wrenching incident… The Congress had made false promises of providing employment to 10 lakh youths and allowance to the unemployed.

In these difficult circumstances, I wish to express my steadfast and friendly support, along with that of the French armed forces,” Parly wrote in the letter.Parly also recalled that India is France’s strategic partner in the region and reiterated France’s “deep solidarity” in the letter.She also expressed her readiness to meet Singh in India, at his invitation, to follow up on their ongoing discussions, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.Parly also conveyed her “heartfelt condolences to the entire Indian armed forces as well as to the grieving families” of the 20 soldiers.Indian and Chinese troops have been engaged in a months-old tense standoff along the LAC, especially in Ladakh sector, where both sides have deployed thousands of additional troops.France, a key supplier of frontline combat jets to the Indian Air Force (IAF) for decades, has stepped up its defence engagements with India in recent years and both sides are working on closer naval cooperation, including joint exercises and patrols, in the Indian Ocean region.Paris has also acted on a special request from New Delhi to speed up deliveries of 36 Rafale combat jets ordered by India in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in 2016, with six of the planes expected to land at the airbase in Ambala on July 27.France is reworking the calendar for supplying the Rafales to India at a faster pace, people familiar with developments said on Monday. IAF ordered the jets as an emergency purchase to arrest a worrying slide in its combat capabilities.Earlier, the first batch of Rafales to be delivered to India in 2020 was expected to comprise four jets. France has stepped up efforts to meet IAF’s immediate requirements.The people said around 10 Rafale jets are ready at manufacturer Dassault Aviation’s Merignac facility and six of them will be flown by IAF pilots to India via Abu Dhabi in late July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/french-defence-minister-conveys-steadfast-support-in-letter-to-indian-counterpart/story-z4EqhOWInmMy0Ifurm2zKP.html

30-06-2020||India||Glacier studies in Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh flag stark climate change impact||Climate change is having a discernible impact on glaciers in the western Himalayan region, studies by Jawaharlal Nehru University’s (JNU) glaciology unit in the School of Environmental Sciences has found.The results of their long-term monitoring of two glaciers, based on observational data and modelling exercises, in Himachal Pradesh (HP) and the Union Territory of Ladakh, have found that in the first decade of the new millennium glacier mass loss was significantly higher than in the late 20th century.While the glaciers will not disappear in the coming decades, the authors of the studies said, negative mass balance -- the net change in its mass over a balance year or fixed year -- of these slowly moving giant mass of ice is likely to have a profound impact on water availability for local communities.They also said that mass loss in glaciers in the region is mainly linked to rising temperatures and reduced snowfall.For the Ladakh study, published in the Journal of Glaciology on May 18, the team found that the Stok glacier is facing as much mass loss as its western Himalayan counterparts, despite being in a higher altitude zone between the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain ranges.The Stok glacier was in a balanced condition during the late 20th century -- around the 1980s --- due to sufficient winter precipitation, or snowfall. However, it was followed by a severe loss during the early 21st century -- prior to 2009 -- and a moderate loss after 2011.“This is mainly because of reduced winter snowfall in the arid Himalayan region. This must be also affecting water availability in villages in and around Stok and Indus river, which must be studied,” said JNU’s Professor AL Ramanathan, the corresponding author of the paper.The paper projects that a 27% increase in snow or rain is required to compensate for the mass loss due to 1 degree Celsius rise in temperature over pre-industrial era levels.“Accelerated temperature rise over the western Himalayas has significantly reduced the amount of snowfall received and also aggravated glacier mass loss,” he added.Another paper published in the same journal on June 23 is a study -- conducted between 2002 and 2019 --- of the Chhota Shigri glacier in HP. The team found over the past two decades, on average half a metre of water equivalent of ice has been drained from this glacier in the Indus river.The glacier is in an imbalanced condition because it has melted more than gained, the paper said.“Overall, the air temperature change is controlling the river run-off, which means a warmer world is likely to be associated with higher water in the Himalayan rivers till the 2050s, which other studies have also observed. There might be a seasonal shift in glacier run-off as well,” Ramanthan said.The country’s first national climate change assessment by the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences published in early June also flagged similar concerns.For instance, the Hindu Kush Himalayas (HKH) region experienced a temperature rise of about 1.3 degrees Celsius between 1951 and 2014, as compared to an average temperature rise of .7 degree over India from 1901 onwards.Several areas of the HKH region have experienced a declining trend in snowfall and also a retreat of glaciers in recent decades. “Several areas in the HKH region have exhibited declining trends in snowfall and retreating glaciers during the recent decades. Parts of the high-elevation Karakoram Himalayas have, in contrast, experienced increased wintertime precipitation in association with enhanced amplitude variations of synoptic western disturbance,” the assessment has said.“There are thousands of glaciers in the western Himalayas. It’s difficult to say how water availability will be impacted in the coming years. We need large observational and satellite studies to have an effective assessment. But reduced snowfall in recent years is linked to an overall trend of glacial retreat,” said Anil Kulkarni, Distinguished Scientist, Divecha Centre for Climate Change, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/glacier-studies-in-ladakh-himachal-pradesh-flag-stark-climate-change-impact/story-xljIuWttGnK3WaD5Vt9GrK.html
30-06-2020||India||PM Modi’s address to nation, his sixth since Covid-19 pandemic began, at 4 pm today||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation on Tuesday evening. The address will begin at 4 pm, a tweet from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said on Monday.PM Modi’s address comes amid tension with China over a stand-off in the Ladakh sector where 20 Indian soldiers were killed on June 15. India has increased patrolling and deployed troops since the stand-off where India and Chinese soldiers came to blows.The prime minister has more than once reiterated that no Indian territory is under enemy’s control and that there are no Chinese outposts on Indian land in Ladakh. PM Modi had held an all-party meeting too on the issue where he paid tribute to the bravehearts who were killed in the line of duty, praised the unity shown by the various political parties and assured that no one entered the Indian territory.The Congress, however, criticised PM Modi’s statement and has since been demanding proof from the government on whether the Chinese have captured parts of Indian territory.PM Modi had talked about the issue in his monthly radio address Mann ki Baat where he said that Indian soldiers had given a befitting reply to those who coveted Indian territory.This would be the prime minister’s sixth address to the nation since the outbreak of the pandemic.Modi had last addressed the nation on May 12 when he had announced a Rs 20 lakh crore financial package to boost the economy recovering from coronavirus-induced lockdown.In his March 19 address, the prime minister announced a “janta curfew” on March 22. On March 24, he announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown. On April 14, he extended the lockdown period till May 3. On April 3, in a video message, PM Modi asked the nation to light lamps for frontline corona warriors on April 5.The lockdown was further extended till May 17 by the Home Ministry.Now, the country is in the phase one of ‘unlock’ and the month-long phase 2 begins on July 1. On Monday evening, the government banned 59 Chinese apps under national security considerations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-address-to-nation-his-sixth-since-covid-19-pandemic-began-at-4-pm-today/story-mrEAvm3QvvEenWdZb6JxDI.html

Some of these villages are 50km from district headquarters with no road connectivity.The tribals also demanded that the bonus given on the paddy procurement should also be given in cash, the government should open schools and hospitals in their area and that police atrocity should stop.Meanwhile, police sealed the district headquarters and deployed extra forces have been deployed in the city following the protest and talks between the tribal representatives and administration is going on.Kawasi Lakhma, the industry minister, in the letter to chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Monday, said that public representatives of Maoist-affected Sukma, Dantewada and Bijpaur have demanded to release the payments of tendu collectors in cash.“In these three districts there is provision for payment through bank cheques but many tribals do not have Aadhaar, PAN card or bank accounts which causes unnecessary troubles. Some areas and about 70 to 80km from the district headquarters,” Lakhma wrote. Bhupesh Baghel considered the demand and cancelled the order making the payments through bank mandatory and ordered that tendu leaves collectors in Sukma, Dantewada and Bijapur will receive cash payments, a government press release said.Ritesh Agarwal, Bijapur’s collector said the district administration will provide every help to the tribals.“Those people who have bank accounts their procurement money will be transferred in their accounts and we will pay them with help of bank sakhis (banking correspondents), who will reach their villages to pay them their money. We have 11 banking correspondents and recruiting about 30 others in next four days,” Agarwal said while speaking to reporters.Tendu leaf is procured in Chhattisgarh at Rs 4,000 per sack from the tribals and this year about government procured the leaves worth about Rs 100 crore from Bijapur district only.“The road connectively is till Gangaloor and most of these tribals are from more than a dozen of villages which are beyond Gangaloor. In 2018, just before the legislative assembly elections, the money was paid to them in cash because of non-connectivity and pressure of the then tribal minister Mahesh Gagda, who was from Bijapur,” said a senior government officer posted in the region.“Since then the tribals of these areas are demanding that tendu patta procurement money should be given in cash,” the official said.The officer added that their demand should be addressed.“This is a fact that they are facing a problem. Some of them have to walk for more than 40km. Most of these tribals don’t have motorbikes and hence they rent a four-wheeler to reach bank but owing to lockdown the vehicles have also stopped. The government should recruit banking correspondents and send it to their villages or the government should arrange vehicles for them,” said the officer. Activists believe tribals are facing problems during the coronavirus lockdown and the government is not paying any heed.“There demands are genuine…Thousands of tribals have come from Gangaloor, Cherlapal and other villages in Bijapur have reached district headquarters after walking for a day.,” said Himanshu Kumar, a tribal rights activist working in Bastar.“The tribals are demanding that they should be paid in cash for tendu patta procurement, which the government is paying through the banks. Bank branches are very less in tribal areas… For some tribals this distance is up to 50 and 60 kilometres,” Kumar said.Kumar claimed that there is no bus or any other means of transport available for the tribals to reach these banks.“Thousands of tribal families do not even have bank accounts due to which they are not getting paid. The tribals had told the collector a month ago that they should be paid in cash but they did not listen, therefore they have started this protest,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tendu-leaves-collectors-in-sukma-dantewada-and-bijapur-to-get-cash-payments-chhattisgarh-govt/story-19S4bv4S7uDCqImoE7a35O.html

I have searched all over my house. Nothing is India’s.”Another Weibo user wrote: “Indian netizens are going to use TikTok through VPN”.So far, Chinese companies on India’s list have not commented on the ban.Also read: Indian websites not accessible in China as Xi Jinping govt blocks VPNThe decision by New Delhi to ban Chinese apps comes days after popular Chinese social media app WeChat–also banned by India–removed updates by the embassy of India (EoI) on the current border conflict including Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement on the clash that left 20 Indian Army soldiers dead.The reasons given for the removal of the posts included divulging state secrets and endangering national security.The updates published on WeChat included Modi’s remarks on the India-China border situation, the phone call between the Indian and Chinese foreign ministers held on Thursday and a statement by the external affairs ministry’s (MEA) spokesperson.A day earlier, EoI had to issue a clarification on its Chinese Twitter-like Weibo account after the same statement by the MEA spokesperson was deleted.On Tuesday, the business and political news website Caixin reported on the Indian government’s decision to ban the Chinese apps.“At present, the Indian government hasn’t clarified how the ban will be carried out. The Indian government may ask telecom providers to stop providing access to these apps,” it said in a report.“Even with unresolved border issues, India has become an important destination for Chinese technology companies,” the report said.The nationalistic tabloid Global Times also carried a report on New Delhi’s decision headlined: “India bans 59 Chinese apps amid border tension”.Xiaomi, the mobile phone company, has pointed out that it has been the leader in India’s smartphone market for five consecutive quarters.“Xiaomi accounted for 30 percent of all smartphone sales in India between January and March. In addition, Xiaomi produces nearly half of India’s fitness brands,” the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-decision-to-ban-tiktok-wechat-and-others-becomes-trending-topic-on-social-media-in-china/story-B93EJIndIqmaZp6kexpBiJ.html

Also, 111 of these are complement beds,” the official had earlier said.On Monday, when asked about the delay in converting the entire hospital into a dedicated facility, a senior official said, “When we mention a ‘bed’, it implies other services also like specialist doctors of that field, staff nurses, monitors, oxygen supply points among others.” These are supposed to be dedicated for Covid-only. Also structural requirements like separate donning-doffing areas, separate entry exit points, dedicated OT are to be catered to, the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ndmc-mayor-inspects-covid-only-hindu-rao-hospital-says-bed-strength-to-be-increased-to-200/story-ndhTEoidSQM2bKG0lIaovL.html
30-06-2020||India||Shivraj Singh Chouhan meets BJP leaders in Delhi ahead of MP cabinet expansion||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is expected to undertake major cabinet expansion in the next few days, after meeting senior leaders of the BJP, including Union home minister Amit Shah and Jyotiradtiya Scindia, in New Delhi.The second cabinet expansion comes at the time when the state is getting ready for by-polls in 24 assembly constituencies in the next few months. In the first expansion on April 21, he had inducted five ministers even though he can have 35 ministerial council, including himself.“The cabinet expansion would take place soon,” Chouhan had said on Wednesday. A senior BJP leader said Chouhan, state BJP president VD Sharma and general secretary (organisation) Suhas Bhagat left for Delhi on Sunday to discuss cabinet expansion. On Monday, talks took place between Chouhan and the central leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), including president JP Nadda and Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar, he added. “Chouhan is also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the evening, ahead of the cabinet expansion in the state,” the leader cited above said. In the first expansion, two of the 22 ex-MLAs, loyalists of Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia, who had resigned from the state assembly in March as Congress MLAs and then joined the BJP—Tulsi Silavat and Govind Singh Rajput—were inducted in the cabinet. Former Congress ministers among these 22 rebels not accommodated in the cabinet include Pradyumn Singh Tomar, Mahendra Sisodia, Prabhuram Chaudhary and Imarti Devi.BJP leaders said there was a possibility that Chouhan may include at least 11 of the 22 rebel Congress leaders, who had joined the BJP.“But there are concerns that accommodating 11 rebel Congress leaders may upset senior BJP legislators, who are eying a cabinet position, and many not go down well with party workers. The party leadership is now trying to work out an amicable solution,” another senior party functionary, who was not willing to be named, said. According to him, Chouhan has conveyed the concerns of the party colleagues in the state, who are upset over being overlooked for a cabinet position, to the central BJP leadership. There are over a dozen BJP legislators, who have been ministers in earlier councils headed by Chouhan and many of them are considered close to him and very senior in the party hierarchy. “The MP unit of the party has decided that MLAs who could not be included in the cabinet would be accommodated as administrators of the cooperative bodies, government-run boards and corporations to avoid any rumblings within the party,” the BJP functionary said.He, however, said these senior legislators have yet not been informed about this decision and therefore, their reaction is not known.Bhupendra Gupta, the spokesperson of the Congress’ state unit, said it was “all being done to misuse government machinery for the by-polls”. “Otherwise, there is no logic behind the second expansion amid the Covid situation particularly when the state government is doing nothing except transfers and postings of government officials for reasons known to all,” Gupta said.State BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai said it was a routine matter.“Cabinet expansion is a routine exercise in the government and prerogative of the chief minister. Whenever CM thinks he is need of a bigger cabinet he will and can do it,” Bajpai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shivraj-singh-chouhan-meets-bjp-leaders-in-delhi-ahead-of-mp-cabinet-expansion/story-fjAaDx228Ihx9AS6o3cSdI.html

The applications banned by the government include Club Factory, SHAREit, Likee, Mi Video Call (Xiaomi), Weibo, Baidu and Bigo Live.Also read: Amit Shah poweredIndia’s ban on 59 China-linked mobile apps“TikTok continues to comply with all data privacy and security requirements under Indian law and has not shared any information of our users in India with any foreign government, including the Chinese government,” Gandhi said.“Further, if we are requested to in the future, we would not do so. We place the highest importance on user privacy and integrity,” he added.The information technology ministry, which issued Monday evening’s ban order, had cited concerns that the 59 applications are ‘prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order’.The IT ministry statement did not identify the 59 applications to be linked to China. But government officials have pointed that the China connection was one common factor between most of the applications that had been ordered to be blocked.Also Read: Indian websites not accessible in China as Xi Jinping govt blocks VPNMonday’s order came against the backdrop of heightened tensions between India and China over the border dispute in Ladakh that led to the deadly June 15 confrontation in Galwan Valley. Home Minister Amit Shah, officials told Hindustan Times, had powered the decision that had been under discussion for weeks within the bureaucracy.The National Security Council Secretariat, which had been involved in the deliberations after intelligence agencies raised a red flag over the applications, had also backed the move.Tuesday morning’s statement by TikTok, however, indicated that the company still believed that it had a fighting chance to make a comeback. It described the government ban as an “interim order” and underlined the role that it said TikTok had played.“TikTok has democratised the internet by making it available in 14 Indian languages, with hundreds of million of users, artists, story-tellers, educators and performers depending on it for their livelihood, many of whom are first time internet users,” the statement from TikTok India head Nikhil Gandhi said.That assertion is unlikely to persuade the government to change its stance.“All these apps have been reported to have been leaking data. Their malpractices have also been singled out by experts. They have been said to take location data, transfer files to servers in China. Moreover, the beauty apps, such as beauty plus and selfie cameras have also been reported for being a threat as they contain pornographic content,” a person familiar with the development had told HT on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-not-share-data-with-chinese-govt-says-tiktok-after-india-bans-59-mobile-apps/story-T8sFz8obZ4kxrd6oCHxfRM.html

30-06-2020||India||In Unlock 2 guidelines, lessons from Covid-19 situation in US, Europe||The government on Monday issued guidelines for the next phase of relaxations aimed at further boosting the economic activity and allow the near-normal life to resume.This will be the second phase of unlocking the country (hence named Unlock 2) where night curfew will be relaxed and more economic activities opened up.The new guidelines issued by the Union home ministry, which will come into effect from July 1, are based on feedback received from states, and consultations with central ministries and departments, the Union home ministry said. The current phase to ease restrictions (called Unlock 1) is ending on Tuesday.The government has learned from the experiences of the United States and Europe, where the coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc and decided to not open those activities or institutions which are not directly related to economic activities.Accordingly, the decision to open schools and colleges has been deferred. There is also added concern due to the monsoon season.Metro Rail services will remain suspended; cinema halls and gyms too will continue to be shut, according to the new guidelines. Social, political, sports, entertainment, academic, cultural, religious functions and other large congregations will also continue to be prohibited. Dates for opening of these will be decided separately, based on the assessment of the situation, the home ministry said.It further said that the domestic and international flights (under the Vande Bharat Mission) and passenger trains have already resumed partially and their operations will be further expanded in a calibrated manner.Lockdown will remain implemented strictly in the containment zones till July 31, the government guidelines said.Containment zones are required to be carefully demarcated by state and union territory governments with a view to contain the spread of Covid-19, after taking into consideration the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.Within the containment zones, strict perimeter control shall be maintained and only essential activities allowed, the home ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-unlock-2-guidelines-lessons-from-covid-19-situation-in-us-europe/story-GXu8GiEA4IhglsiVGFYweI.html

The senior military commanders from India and China are meeting at Chushul on Tuesday to work out the de-escalation and disengagement process on mutual terms.The army’s decision to deploy the T-90 Bishma tanks was taken after the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had beefed up its positions on the river bed with armoured personnel carriers and troop tents. The Indian Army is occupying the dominant heights in the sector within its side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Infantry combat vehicles along with 155mm howitzers have been deployed all along 1597 km long LAC in East Ladakh with two tank regiments deployed in Chushul sector to repel any aggressive plans of the adversary through the Spanggur Gap. While Chinese PLA wants to make a deal on the LAC in this sector as part of withdrawal, the Indian Army is no mood to give an inch as the military aggression came from the Western Theatre Command of China with the intention of redefining the LAC.According to military commanders, India is prepared for a long haul in this limited spectrum with capability of a full spectrum retaliation in case the red flag goes up. With the water temperature in the river already touching 10 below zero and the river bed temperatures more frosty than the dominant heights due to temperature inversion, it is only a matter of time when “General Winter” takes over the area and makes Chinese positions in Galwan Valley untenable.While the PLA propaganda talks about introduction of troops trained in martial arts in the East Ladakh sector, fact is that the Chinese foot soldier is conscripted into the army for two years unlike the Indian hardy trooper who stays a minimum of 17 years. Since 1984, the Indian trooper has been trained in high altitude war to repel Pakistan Army from taking over Siachen glacier and has been sitting heights of over 15,000 feet in both Kargil as well as East Ladakh sector.The general morale of the Indian military commanders and troops is very high with both Indian Air Force and Indian Navy deployed in highest state of alertness. Majority of Chinese PLA Air Force fighters are taking off from Hotan air base in Taklamakan desert, some 240 km from the LAC with surface to air missiles deployed to counter the Indian fighters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-deploys-t-90-tanks-in-galwan-valley-after-china-s-aggressive-posturing-at-lac/story-eTMbY40wHoV5w55edknd9K.html

30-06-2020||India||‘Ban on 59 Chinese apps for safety, security and integrity of India’, says government||India on Monday banned 59 Chinese mobile applications amid border stand-off with the neighbouring country. The government has cited national security for banning these apps.The ban covers some of the most popular apps in India like TikTok, SHAREiT, UC Browser and WeChat.Almost all the apps banned have some preferential Chinese interest and the majority have parent Chinese companies.The decision to ban these apps was taken after it was found that “they are engaged in activities which is prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, the security of the state and public order”, the Ministry of Information Technology said in a release on Monday.The release further said that the ministry has received many complaints from various sources including several reports about the misuse of some mobile apps available on Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS platforms for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users’ data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India.“For safety, security, defence, sovereignty & integrity of India and to protect data & privacy of people of India the Government has banned 59 mobile apps. Jai Hind!” Law, Electronics and Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Twitter. For safety, security, defence, sovereignty & integrity of India and to protect data & privacy of people of India the Government has banned 59 mobile apps. Jai Hind! 🇮🇳Indian intelligence agencies had been trying to restrict the mobile applications on grounds that the apps were designed to extract data and park them outside the country, where at a later stage they could be used to intrude into the privacy of Indian citizens.Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) and domestic social media app ShareChat welcomed the move. “This huge unprecedented step will go a long way in strengthening the ‘Boycott China’ campaign of CAIT. Boycott China movement is now well and truly a national reality and seven crore traders of India stands in solidarity with the Union Government,” CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said in a statement.ShareChat Director Public Policy Berges Malu the company expects the government to continue their support for the Indian startup ecosystem.“This step can prove to be a golden moment in Indian startup journey with ‘Made in India’ apps getting a rare opportunity to onboard those users and provide them with these services. Indian technology ecosystem has come a long way in last 5-6 years and are at par with the capabilities of any other startup ecosystem in the world. We welcome this move and we hope Indians will choose apps which are made in India, for India,” said Piyush, CEO and founder, Rooter, Delhi-based gaming and Sport Live app.Relations between the two countries have been strained following the deaths of 20 Indian troops in a stand-off in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15.Most of the applications are highly popular in India, including ByteDance-owned video-sharing app TikTok, with a combined user base of more than half a billion.There are estimated to be about 120 million TikTok users in India, making the South Asian nation of 1.3 billion people the app’s biggest international market.Chinese mobiles have an almost 65 per cent share in the local smartphone market.From toys, cosmetics, makeup and handbags to home appliances, pharma, auto components, and steel, China exports more than 3,000 products to India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ban-on-59-chinese-apps-for-safety-security-and-integrity-of-india-says-government/story-2xjSwEyflOTrXjGvk4ymgK.html
30-06-2020||India||India, China corp commanders to meet today on border stand-off: Time, place and other details||Top Indian and Chinese military officials will meet for the third time on Tuesday in Ladakh’s Leh district to defuse tension along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).The meeting between corp commanders is the third—first was held on June 6 and second on June 22 in Moldo on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC)—after border tensions erupted between both the countries in May.The second meeting came a week after the violent face-off between soldiers from the Indian Army and China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley.Here are the details:* This time the talks will be held in Chushul on the Indian side at 10:30am and led by corps commanders* The Indian side could again demand the pullback of Chinese troops from several friction points and also the restoration of status quo ante in strategic areas. * On June 22, Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region, led the meeting between delegations for nearly 11 hours. It was held a week after the June 15 brutal clash between soldiers from the Indian Army and China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley.* The marathon dialogue was held in a cordial, positive and constructive atmosphere and there was “mutual consensus to disengage”. “Modalities for disengagement from all friction areas in eastern Ladakh were discussed and will be taken forward by both the sides,” an official, in the know of the details, had said then asking not to be named.* During that meeting, India had demanded the pullback of Chinese troops from the Finger Area—a cluster of strategic features in the north bank of Pangong Tso—where the PLA has set up bunkers, pillboxes and observation posts.* They said the army was also demanding the withdrawal of the PLA troops from Galwan Valley and the restoration of status quo ante in key strategic areas of in the Finger Area, Gogra Post-Hot Springs and Galwan Valley.* On June 6, Lt Gen Singh and Maj Gen Liu led the meeting between the delegations and was the first meeting of top military officials since the two armies locked in the border standoff that began with a confrontation between rival patrols near Pangong Lake on May 5. * After the seven-hours-long meeting, the external affairs ministry had said India and China will continue military and diplomatic contacts to resolve the stand-off along LAC.* It “took place in a cordial and positive atmosphere”, MEA had said and added that both sides agreed to work towards peacefully resolving the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-corp-commanders-to-meet-today-on-border-stand-off-time-place-and-other-details/story-dFk8xOy16ntAXMohrYhebJ.html
30-06-2020||India||In 6 years, forest land the size of Nagaland diverted||Forest land nearly equal to the size of Nagaland has been approved for diversion between 2014 and 2020 or is pending to be approved for various infrastructure and developmental projects such as mining, irrigation, and regularisation of encroachments, according to an analysis by Vijay Ramesh, a PhD student at Columbia University.Ramesh has analysed 48,000 clearance proposals using the R programming language (the raw data is available on GitHub). He sourced the forest clearance data from the Union environment ministry’s Parivesh website, which has details of all clearances divided into two sections—before 2014 and after 2014.The ministry approved or continues to consider 99.3% of the project proposals it received involving forest diversion during the last six years compared to 84.6% of the projects that were considered and approved between 1975 and 2014. From 1975 to 2014, about 21632.5 sq km of forest land was approved to be cleared or is pending to be cleared, compared to 14822.47 sq km of forests approved between 2014 and 2020. The analysis comes as the ministry is about to notify the controversial Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2020. The notification is expected to overhaul the process of environmental regulation of infrastructure projects. It has contentious clauses including the one pertaining to the regularisation of projects, which violated the EIA Notification, 2006, by starting construction work before environmental clearance or by expanding capacity. The draft EIA Notification, 2020, also proposes shortening of the time for public hearings, which give people affected by a project opportunity to understand it and give their consent.Ramesh said the data suggests the proportion of forest areas stated to be cleared since 2014 is over 68% of what was cleared between 1975 and 2014. “Over a 39 year period, the data suggests that 21,63,215 hectares of forests were approved/pending approval to be cleared. In stark comparison, since 2014, 14,82,247 hectares of forests were approved/pending approval to be cleared. Furthermore, this is simply what the ‘Forests’ clearance data suggests. We are yet to analyse data on ‘wildlife’ clearances and ‘environmental’ clearances,” he wrote in an email.The analysis found that before 2014, most of the forest diversion was related to encroachments and mining while between 2014 and 2020, it has been mainly mining-led. Before 2014, large chunks of forested land were approved for clearing in 1984, 1989, 1995 and 2006. In 2016, forest area approved for clearing was more than double the area approved in 2006 alone, the analysis shows. Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh are set to lose vast chunks of forest land, according to data on clearances between 2014 and 2020.While forest and environmental clearance are not the same and EIA, 2020, would not apply to forest clearances, experts said a forest clearance is a prerequisite for environmental clearance in projects involving forests.One of the main objectives of the draft is to bring those industries or projects under the regulation that have violated the EIA, 2006, notification by starting construction work before environmental clearance was granted or by expanding capacity. Those that will be regularised will have to pay a late fee for violating norms. The draft also increases the validity of the environment clearances. It provides clearance validity for 50 years for mining projects, against 30 years in the present notification; 15 years from river valley projects against 10 years. Project proponents will have to submit clearance compliance reports once a year against every 6 months in the current system. No fresh studies by Expert Appraisal Committee should be asked for unless “new facts” come to the notice and it becomes “inevitable” to seek additional studies, the draft says.But the draft is not entirely new. The environment ministry had come out with a zero draft of EIA, 2020, in April last year. Many of the clauses in the zero draft had already been introduced as amendments by the ministry earlier but were challenged in court because of their impact on environmental regulation. Even in April when the zero draft was released, there was widespread criticism of the clauses and relaxations granted which could jeopardise ecology.Environment secretary R P Gupta said he was unaware of this analysis but added India is one of the least industrialised countries. “Our GDP is much less than the GDP of developed countries. 60% of our population remains in the agriculture sector. So, if industrialisation is increasing, what is wrong with it? Why does not he [Ramesh] deindustrialise the US? I can add that there are vested interests who do not want people to enjoy the fruit of industrialisation,” he said.Kanchi Kohli, a legal researcher with New Delhi’s Centre for Policy Research, said if forest land is involved in any project seeking environment clearance, forest clearance has to be sought before the former comes into effect. “Project proponents also have to disclose the break-up of forest and non-forest land in question... In recent years, there has been a huge burden on non-forest land for setting up projects. Many solar parks are on revenue commons important for grazing. In coastal areas, areas affected by ports, coastal roads, or tourism projects include entire fishing villages and traditional fishing harbours. Yet, there is no formal record available for the amount of land-use change being approved in the name of environment clearances.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-6-years-forest-land-the-size-of-nagaland-diverted/story-GzksCVWeGfMaEWoGVxMLXO.html
30-06-2020||India||Delhiwale: Blooming in the pandemic||What a sight. So full of flowers. Thousands and thousands of them.These two bougainvillaea trees in central Delhi’s Lodhi Garden make one of the city’s most stunning spectacles, though usually during a particular time of the year. Most Delhi connoisseurs would argue that an aesthetic experience of the city demands a visit to its great monuments, but a satisfying experience of the Capital necessitates a pilgrimage to this pair of trees during their prime bloom. Delhi has lush bougainvillaea sights in other places too—including Buddha Garden, the roundabout near the Italian embassy, Chelmsford Road, etc., etc.—but no place compares to the show put up by these two trees.As a matter of fact, the glorious duo has already been celebrated in these pages two years ago.But this time it’s different.The familiar pink on them might be... lockdown bougainvillaeas.To be sure, bougainvillaeas bloom throughout the year and are very friendly with high temperature. These two exceptional bougainvillea trees, however, are most amply loaded with their bloom in peak summer—from March to May. This fateful year their great blossom must have come and gone away unseen, with the park regulars stranded in their homes due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. By late June every year, the trees look like any other drab scrap of vegetation.But. It’s late June right now and the two trees are in full-fledged blossoming. It’s rare, a gardener confirms. Are the considerate trees trying to give us a second chance to appreciate their splendour?One theory of their quick re-flush is offered by PK Tripathi, a member of the executive committee of the Delhi-based Bougainvillea Society of India. Talking on phone, Mr Tripathi repeats that while bougainvillaeas blossom throughout the year, the profuse flowering occurs only in the harsh summer season. “The reason behind the current spectacular show going on in Lodhi Garden is definitely the cleaner air caused by the lockdown.”Another reason is propounded by S Chellaiah, director, horticulture, NDMC, whose department looks after the Lodhi Garden. “The synchronisation of recent showers with high temperature produced high humidity, which gave this fantastic bloom.”Regardless, it is difficult to enjoy this beauty when the world is going through a trying time due to the pandemic. The general distress is discernible in the fact that the green benches under the trees are without romantic couples. A visitor’s first instinct in a normal time would be to claim the vacant seat immediately, but now there are new concerns—what if any asymptomatic person, infected with corona, sat on the lovely bench earlier?Meanwhile, the monsoon is almost here, the heat won’t last long and this luscious rash will go away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-blooming-in-the-pandemic/story-ECODjum8OHKcFokcOG4beM.html
30-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Delhi has conducted around 100,000 rapid antigen tests for the coronavirus disease.These tests themselves are interesting for two reasons. One, they were conducted in so-called containment zones, parts of the city roiled by the viral infection, and where there are significant restrictions on movements and activities. Two, because the aim of these tests was to see the extent of the disease’s prevalence in these hot spots (another term preferred by Indian health policymakers), none of the existing rules governing testing applied. Anyone from the area could get tested (and many did).Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAcross states, even in ones such as Tamil Nadu that are testing aggressively, it isn’t usually possible for someone without symptoms, or who has not had contact with a Covid-positive person, to be tested. The findings of the survey are also interesting. Around 7.46% of those tested returned a positive result. In research terms, this is how one can express this: in a survey of a randomly selected sample of around 100,000 people from Delhi’s containment zones, 7.46% were found to be infected with the virus that causes the coronavirus disease.This isn’t the same as the sero (blood) survey of 20,000 people that has been launched to see if they have antibodies to the Sars-CoV-2 virus and are, therefore, potentially immune to it (at least for some time). That survey is ongoing (it will end on July 6) and the results are expected shortly after that. Between the sero survey (which also has a random sample) and the antigen tests, we will finally have a measure of the pandemic’s spread in a city that has been hit hard by it. Delhi ended Monday with 85,161 cases and 2,680 deaths, 15% of all cases in India thus far, and 15.9% of all deaths.Hypothetically, a 7.46% prevalence sounds about right. The US CDC said last week that based on several antibody tests (the same kind of sero surveys Delhi is conducting) around the country, it believes only one in 10 infections in the country has come to light. That would put the prevalence of the disease in the US at around 7.5%. Is that a coincidence? I wouldn’t know, but sometimes diseases do tend to follow similar patterns across countries.The bad news is that 7.5%, or even 10%, is far away from the 60-65% of the population that needs to be infected before we can reach herd immunity – the stage where the chain of infection gets broken because six out of 10 people the virus tries to infect have already been infected and are therefore immune. In an article in Science last week, mathematicians from the universities of Nottingham and Stockholm wrote that the number could be as low as 43%. They assumed that every infected person would infect 2.5 other people, and also made allowances for age and mobility of the population. But 7.5% or 10% is also far away from 43%.There can be no arguing with the broader concept of herd immunity – it’s how populations survive – but, in this case, it is going to take time before 43% of the population has been infected.Some of India’s other badly affected states and cities would do well to follow the Delhi example and test the broader population. Tamil Nadu should; as should Maharashtra. And other states, even ones that have not been hit as hard by the pandemic, should follow suit. As far back as May, the Indian Council of Medical Research recommended random sero surveys to be carried out every week, and in each one of the country’s 700+ districts. That hasn’t happened, but it’s worth remembering that states that follow this advice now may avoid the crisis that Delhi, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu are managing with varying degrees of success.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-sM1BVDzaRacXyaoXZ7uoSM.html
30-06-2020||India||Covid-19: Unlock 2 will retain most curbs, curfew to be eased||The Centre on Monday issued guidelines for the second of a three-phase plan aimed at lifting restrictions imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), announcing that educational institutions, Metro rail services and large gatherings will continue to remain banned, even as the night curfew was relaxed by an hour to aid economic activity.The Union home ministry released the plan, called Unlock 2, to open up more activities in areas outside containment zones, an official statement said. The new guidelines, which will come into effect from July 1, are based on feedback received from states, and consultations with central ministries and departments, it added. The current phase to ease restrictions, called Unlock 1, ends on Tuesday. After 68 days under a lockdown to halt the spread of Covid-19, the country began opening up widely last month, but with significant restrictions. On Monday, India reported 18,318 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the tally of infections to 567,344. There have been 16,901 deaths from the infectious disease so far.The fresh guidelines said schools, colleges and coaching institutions will remain closed till July 31. It added that Metro rail, cinema halls, gymnasiums, swimming pools, entertainment parks, theatres, bars, auditoriums, assembly halls and similar places will also remain shut. Social, political, sports, entertainment, academic, cultural, religious functions and other large congregations will also continue to be banned.“Dates for opening of these will be decided separately, based on the assessment of the situation,” the Centre said.In another significant step, the Union government relaxed the night curfew prohibiting non-essential travel. The ban on such movement will be between 10pm and 5am. Previously, it was between 9pm and 5am. “Relaxations in night curfew have been given for seamless operation of industrial units in multiple shifts, movement of persons and goods on National and State Highways, loading and unloading of cargo and movement of persons to their destinations after disembarking from buses, trains and airplanes,” the guidelines said.Domestic and international flights (under the Vande Bharat exercise) and passenger trains, already operational in a limited manner, will be further expanded in a calibrated manner, the home ministry said.“Lockdown shall continue to be implemented strictly in the containment zones till July 31,” the government’s advisory said. Within the containment zones, strict perimeter control will be maintained and only essential activities are allowed.Shortly after the guidelines were released on Monday night, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that he will address the nation at 4pm on Tuesday.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe government has said that the plan to unlock the country has an “economic focus”, as it looks to bring stalled businesses and activities back on track. Shops, depending on their area, can have more than five people at a time, the government said on Monday night. “However, they have to maintain adequate physical distance.”Training institutions of the central and state governments will be allowed to function with effect from July 15. The standard operating procedure in this regard will be issued by the department of personnel and training.Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla wrote to chief secretaries, saying they were not allowed to dilute the guidelines of “Unlock 2”. “..States/UTs cannot dilute restrictions issued by the MHA. States/UTs, based on their assessment, may prohibit certain activities in areas outside containment zones, or impose such restrictions as deemed necessary. However, there shall be no restriction on inter-state and intra-state movement of persons and goods including those for cross border trade under treaties with neighboring countries.”“I would urge you to ensure compliance of Unlock 2.0 guidelines and direct all authorities for their strict implementation,” Bhalla said in his letter. The government has so far allowed the functioning of public and private offices in a graded manner, resumed limited passenger train services and domestic air travel, and also allowed the conditional reopening of shops and marketplaces. Restrictions on public transport too have been considerably eased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-centre-issues-unlock-2-protocol/story-yVszNdCxxU6NdzLc2EUL1J.html

He is the 15th person to serve as Attorney General for India. Venugopal succeeded Mukul Rohatgi who was the Attorney General from June 2014 to June 2017.Venugopal was asked by the central government to continue as AG after his three-year tenure was set to expire on June 30. He agreed but asked the government to restrict his second tenure for only 1 year considering his advanced age. He is currently 89 years old. Usually, law officers are appointed for a three-year term. Besides, the AG, the serving Solicitor General, Tushar Mehta is also set to get an extension. The Appointments Committee of the Union Cabinet approved extension of Mehta’s tenure for three more years from July 1.Five serving additional solicitor general (ASG), Vikramajit Banerjee, Aman Lekhi, Madhavi Goradia Divan, KM Nataraj and Sanjay Jain also received extension for three years. The cabinet also cleared the appointment of six new ASGs to represent central government before the Supreme Court for a period of three years. They are Balbir Singh, Suryaprakash V Raju, Rupinder Singh Suri, N Venkataraman, Jayant K Sud and Aishwarya Bhati. Five new ASGs have also been appointed for high courts — Yezdezard Jehangir Dastoor (Calcutta), Chetan Sharma (Delhi), Sankaranarayanan (Madras), Dr. Krishna Nandan Singh (Patna) and Devang Girish Vyas (Gujarat).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-notifies-extension-of-venugopal-as-ag/story-2NvbPNKJlGjBTywoIwhgYI.html
30-06-2020||India||NHAI server attacked by malware, govt says no data loss||The server of government’s highway construction arm--the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) was attacked by a malware Sunday night, according to officials aware of the development. When the malware attacked the email server of the authority, it may have also impacted the huge pool of data on highways and confidential information over the past decade, officials said. However, NHAI has clarified that the attack was foiled, and no data loss took place.“A ransomware attack on NHAI email server took place yesterday night. The attack was foiled by the security system and email servers were shut down from safety point of view. The system has been restored now. No data loss took place. NHAI Data lake and other systems remained unaffected from this attack,” an NHAI spokesperson told Hindustan Times.Ransomware is a type of cyberattack where the hacker tries to infect a server with a type of malware that renders users of the server unable to access key files. Before he removes the malware and lets users regain access to their data and devices, the hacker then demands a ransom.According to a cyber security firm Sophos, 82% of Indian organisations were reportedly hit by ransomware over the last year. “This is not a huge surprise. Cyber-hygiene is generally poor in India, and pirated technology abounds, creating weaknesses in cyber defenses. This makes organisations vulnerable to attack,” it wrote in its report titled ‘The State of Ransomware 2020’. Criminals have successfully encrypted files in 73% of the attacks and breaches worldwide, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhai-server-attacked-by-malware-govt-says-no-data-loss/story-wGDAcPUo4MWzPLOcqu2WZJ.html
30-06-2020||India||India bans TikTok, other Chinese apps||The Union government announced on Monday a ban on 59, mostly Chinese, mobile applications such as TikTok, UC Browser and WeChat, citing concerns that these are ‘prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order’.The move comes after weeks of discussions within the government that began before the border dispute with China flared up earlier this month, but was expedited in the aftermath of the deadly June 15 confrontation in Galwan Valley, officials aware of the discussions told HT on the condition of anonymity.Officials cited above said Union home minister Amit Shah extended his support to the move to block the applications, and signed off on a recommendation by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla on Saturday before the order was formally issued by the IT ministry as per protocol.HT reported about these discussions and the possibility of the ban on June 17.According to a statement issued by the IT ministry, the ministry of home affairs, Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre and many citizens had asked for the “blocking of these malicious apps”. The concern in particular is about these applications jeopardising the data of Indian users. The 59 apps had been reported for “leaking data”, according to IT ministry official who asked not to be named. “All these apps have been reported to have been leaking data. Their malpractices have also been singled out by experts. They have been said to take location data, transfer files to servers in China. Moreover, the beauty apps, such as beauty plus and selfie camera have also been reported for being a threat as they contain pornographic content,” this person said.“Although most of these apps are of either Chinese origin or controlled by Chinese companies, there are others based out of Singapore and Hong Kong,” the official added.Last week, cybersecurity researchers discovered video sharing TikTok was among several applications that could illegitimately access any data an iPhone user would have copied. TikTok acknowledged the issue and said it was due to a faulty component in the app, and that they would rush a fix.Intelligence agencies have been pushing for restrictions on such mobile applications on grounds that they were designed to extract data and park them outside the country where they could be used to intrude into the privacy of citizens.Such concerns were alluded to in the IT ministry statement on Monday. “The ministry of information technology has received many complaints from various sources including several reports about misuse of some mobile apps available on Android and iOS platforms for stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users’ data in an unauthorised manner to servers which have locations outside India”.“The compilation of these data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures,” it added. The ministry said it was using its powers under section 69A of the information technology act to announce the ban. Among the 59 apps are some that are popularly used. TikTok, according to Bloomberg data, had nearly 200 million users in India as of January this year. Others, such as CamScanner and SHAREIt, are popular tools used by people to digitize and exchange information. Chinese companies have been suspected of building backdoors in their hardware and software, a concern most prominently cited by several countries where officials have been wary of deploying Chinese-made 5G networking equipment.Robert O’Brien, the National Security Adviser in the Trump administration, recently said China-linked companies acted as an arm of Beijing’s Communist party and tried to “control thoughts” to serve the party’s interests.According to experts, further clarity on the ban will depend on the exact order issued. “At the outset, the government must make the order public,” said Ramanjit Singh Chima, lawyer and Asia Pacific Policy Director at Access Now, an international digital rights group. “This is a press release, it doesn’t mention who this order is directed towards, is the app providers or the app stores or the internet service providers that have to enforce the ban.” Cheema added that under section 69 of the Act, the IT Ministry has in the past kept such order confidential even though it is unconstitutional to do so. “The bigger question to ask is, is it legitimate to issue a blanket ban on an entire service. International courts have ruled it is a disproportionate restriction on free speech, you can restrict content but it has to be in a proportionate.” “In doing this, the government has also blocked legitimate government departments and the media who have a substantial presence on some of these apps. It goes against India’s ethos of free speech,” he said. There are several government agencies, such MyGov and the Press Information Bureau that have accounts on TikTok and these will now be deleted, according to a government official who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-bans-tiktok-other-chinese-apps/story-THNECB6MbXh9TQkpFx0WII.html
30-06-2020||India||Delhi to set up plasma bank, launch helpline||Delhi will set up a plasma bank to pool in blood rich in virus-fighting antibodies, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday, in a plan to help critically ill patients of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have better access to one of the most effective treatment options yet. Therapy through transfusion of plasma – a component of the blood – has been on in the national capital since April 22, weeks after global studies showed that the technique drastically improved the chances of recovery among people with severe Covid-19 illness. “There is high demand for plasma therapy among people. Around two months ago, we were one of the first states to start plasma therapy trials... results are good. It has been observed that plasma therapy helps stabilise respiratory rate of moderate to severe patients and it can save lives,” said Kejriwal at a press briefing over video on Monday.“But it cannot save patients with multi-organ failures, those in extremely severe conditions,” he added.The plasma bank will operate largely like a blood bank and will be set up at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) Hospital in south Delhi. Patients in government and private hospitals in Delhi can approach it with a recommendation from a doctor, the CM said.“This will probably be the first plasma bank of the country. Any Covid-19-cured individual would be able to donate plasma and active Covid-19 patients admitted in both private and government hospitals would be able to avail it. But only a doctor can recommend plasma therapy and it cannot be randomly sought by any Covid-19 patient. After recommendation, the concerned hospital has to inform ILBS for plasma,” he said.Tracing its roots to the early 20th century, plasma therapy works on a simple premise: blood from a patient who has beaten Covid-19 is transfused into someone still struggling with the infection. This effectively amounts to rushing a reinforcement of virus antibodies. The first indication of plasma therapy being effective against Covid-19 came in a scientific paper published on April 6 by Chinese experts who discovered rapid recovery among 10 patients in their trial. Within 1-3 days of being given plasma, these people were free of symptoms of the disease .According to Kejriwal, plasma therapy trials in Delhi have helped improve health condition of 34 out of 35 Covid-19 patients in government hospitals and 46 out of 49 patients in private hospitals.The chief minister said that the government is working on the modalities of the plasma bank, which will be finalised in another two days. “This will streamline the plasma therapy system in the city. The arrangement is in ILBS Hospital because it is not a Covid-19 hospital. The donors are safe and they will not be infected again. The government will also be paying for their conveyance,” said Kejriwal, urging more Covid-19 recovered patients to donate blood in coming days.Blood and plasma donations require specific matching of blood groups, which often makes sourcing of plasma difficult, especially at short notice. “Availability of plasma is a big issue. So far, both private and government hospitals that got approval for plasma therapy have maintained their own plasma banks. A centralised system will streamline the process and enable better monitoring, better data management and grievance redressal,” said Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital.“However, having one such bank for the whole city can put excessive stress on the concerned hospital. The government, in the coming days, should create a network of plasma banks by setting up more facilities in accordance with locations of Covid-19-dedicated hospitals in the city,” he added.Kejriwal said the government will soon set up a helpline through which potential plasma donors can come forward and health officials can begin reaching out to recovered people. Last week, the chief minister said that plasma therapy in Lok Nayak Hospital helped reduce the death rate among Covid-19 patients by around 50%. Data shared by the government on Sunday showed that the government hospital recorded 51 deaths in the week between ending June 26, compared to 100 deaths between June 6 and 12. Last week, the Delhi government got the Centre’s approval for 200 more plasma therapy trials, following which it also started them at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital.On Monday evening, several Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) functionaries who are recovering from Covid-19, including Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain, pledged to become plasma donors.The chief minister, in the video briefing, also announced a compensation of ~1 crore for the family of Dr Asheem Gupta, a doctor in the Lok Nayak Hospital who died of Covid-19 on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-to-set-up-plasma-bank-launch-helpline/story-paVyoD4S7lhVjmd9FyQWJO.html
30-06-2020||India||Space centre scientists develop an innovative mask||Two scientists at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre in Thiruvananthapuram, an important wing of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), developed a new mask which they said ensured a proper filtration and remove some of the irritants of normal mask especially for bespectacled.The new mask is configured in two zones, a nasal part and an oral part, stitched into a single unit, preventing mixing of nasal and oral aerosols avoiding foggy vision for bespectacled, said a statement released by the scientists. No patent or trademark, details of mask developed by P Venuprasad and Dr Anitha S are available on Facebook and material cost will be around ₹10 a piece and any tailor can make it easily, the statement said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“The nasal part is stitched with wire strips which fit comfortably to any nose contour. A mask holding string facilitates hanging it on the chest, when removed in between. It is made with adjustable ear loops, which give a comfortable and efficient fitting to the face,” it said adding these masks made of khadi clothes are durable.Most of the ordinary masks have poor filtration capacity and don’t fit well on the face reducing its performance. Air exhaled towards eyes may lead to dryness and associated problems in the long run but the new mask solves most of these problems. The mask can be washed and reused several times, the statement added.“It has three layers with the filter fabric material in between. In addition, a replaceable filter cartridge infused with a blend of ayurvedic essential oils can be placed in the nasal zone, which is optional. The mask can be configured into different sizes as per the need,” the statement said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/space-centre-scientists-develop-an-innovative-mask/story-HGOEuDfjXWjbhHqXCwJr0M.html
30-06-2020||India||T’gana home minister tests positive for Covid||Telangana home minister Mohammad Mahmood Ali was on Sunday admitted to a corporate hospital in Hyderabad after he tested positive for Covid-19, health department officials said.The minister, who attended a series of programmes including Haritha Haram, under which he had taken up tree plantation in the police parade grounds at Gosha Mahal in the old city area last week, got tested for Covid-19 three days ago, after his gunman tested positive last week.“On Sunday, the test result proved that he was positive for the virus. He immediately got admitted to a corporate hospital in Jubilee Hills,” an official in the health department said.Ali is the first cabinet minister in the state to test positive for Covid-19. Earlier, three TRS legislators, gunmen and personal assistants of at least three ministers tested positive and are undergoing treatment at different hospitals.At the Telangana State Police Academy (TSPA), at least100 trainee sub-inspectors and 80 officials and staff were positive. Meanwhile, state health minister Eatala Rajender admitted that the number of positive cases for Covid-19 had been on the rise in Hyderabad and surroundings, but the death rate was not very alarming – it was just around 1.1 per cent which was very low compared to the national average of 3 per cent.He said the state cabinet would take a decision soon on the reimposition of lock down in Hyderabad and surroundings in the wake of growing cases.Meanwhile, a central team led by joint secretary of Union ministry of health Luv Agarwal, is extensively touring different hospitals in Hyderabad to inspect the facilities and treatment being given to the Covid-19 patients. The team will hold a series of meetings with state government officials to assess the ground situation in Hyderabad, which accounts for 88 per cent of the Covid-19 cases in the state||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/t-gana-home-minister-tests-positive-for-covid/story-V35TAXeovHSg7gavTFxdAO.html
30-06-2020||India||Parliament may meet in September for monsoon session||In the absence of a workable model that will allow appropriate social distancing for members of Parliament (MPs) and their staff, there is a possibility that the forthcoming monsoon session of Parliament will not be held in July and could even be pushed to September, two people familiar with the decision-making process said on condition of anonymity. Officials have considered the possibility of holding online sessions, where half the members will be seated in the House and the other half joins online, but this has been found untenable as it requires members to give consent on how they would want to join the session. They have also considered shifting the sessions of both houses to either other locations within the Parliament complex or outside, but this, too, has been ruled out because of the difficulties in implementing social distancing norms. One of the two people, who has participated in meetings on the issue, said that since there is no pressing matter at hand, for instance, the passage of ordinance that will otherwise lapse, and since there is no immediate constitutional requirement to convene the session, there is a possibility that Parliament will convene once there is solution at hand for ensuring proper social distancing protocols.“As per the Constitution, there is no specification of the number of days or the period during which Parliament should meet. As per Article 85, the only requirement is that gap between two sessions should not be more than six months. The last session was in March, which means we have time till September,” added this person.The ordinances in effect at the moment also have a time-cushion before they lapse. President Ramnath Kovind, in June, promulgated The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Ordinance 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, and, last week, the ordinance to amend banking regulations. “All of these ordinances will not expire before six months from the day of being promulgated, which give us more time to plan,” the first person said.The Opposition has demanded that Parliament be convened to discuss important issues at hand including the stand-off with China and the coronavirus pandemic. Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla have also held several rounds of meetings to work out how Parliament can resume work even as the protocols for health and social distancing are not breached.“There were many suggestions mooted such as using the central hall for convening the Lok Sabha and using the Lok Sabha hall for Rajya Sabha. However, all these have been found untenable. There is not enough space to ensure physical distancing required even if this suggestion is followed,” said the person quoted above.Officials of both the houses had pointed out that logistical problems such as rearranging names on the computers. Similarly, unless a member voluntarily opts for joining the session online, the secretariat of either house cannot take a decision on who can be permitted to attend the House in person.The first person said that with the number of Covid-19 cases continuing to surge, it is imperative that the House functions only with the necessary protocol. “There were also suggestions to have the monsoon session in Vigyan Bhavan. That was explored too, but space and security constraints have made that untenable too. The biggest hall in Vigyan Bhavan can be used at best for holding a day long session. Since the annexe of Vigyan Bhavan already houses offices, there will be no space to accommodate the staff or ministers and MPs.”The second person, who is familiar with the proceedings at the meetings also said that several MPs had indicated that since the House has to only reconvene before September 23, the secretariats should be given more time to come up with a sustainable model that will ensure safety of the members, their staff and the security personnel.“There are between 20,000-40,000 people who visit Parliament EVERY DAY when the sessions are on. It is not an easy task to create a safe space for such large numbers,” the second person said. As per convention, Parliament meets for three sessions in a year, the Budget session, the monsoon session and the winter session.Experts say that the government must do more to find a workable solution. “A session of the Andhra Pradesh legislature was recently held where the Governor gave his address by video conference. Media reports suggest that to ensure physical distancing between legislators, the Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Saha might consider holding its next session in a large conference venue opposite the Vidhan Sabha building. The constitution tasks the government with the responsibility of convening the legislature. It is now for the government to ensure that MPs can meet safely either within Parliament or at any other larger venue where norms of distancing can be ensured,” said Chakshu Roy, Head of Legislative and Civic Engagement, PRS Legislative Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-may-meet-in-sept-for-monsoon-session/story-59hmWBDsmJylZktTigpQLM.html
30-06-2020||India||Covid-19 vaccine by Bharat Biotech first to get human trials nod||India’s drug controller has given approval for human clinical trials of the country’s first coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine candidate, which has been developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology (NIV), the vaccine maker said on Monday.The trials for the vaccine, named Covaxin, are likely to begin next month, the firm said. The strains of Sars-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19 was isolated by ICMR-NIV and transferred to Bharat Biotech in May. Scientists have managed to isolate and culture 11 strains that can be used to develop vaccines and aid research.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe indigenous and inactivated vaccine candidate was developed and manufactured at Bharat Biotech’s BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) High Containment facility located in Genome Valley, Hyderabad.“The Drug Controller General of India… granted permission to initiate Phase I & II Human clinical trials after the company submitted results generated from preclinical studies, demonstrating safety and immune response. Human clinical trials are scheduled to start across India in July 2020,” the company said.Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director, Bharat Biotech, said: “We are proud to announce COVAXIN, India’s first indigenous vaccine against Covid-19.The collaboration with ICMR and NIV was instrumental in the development of this vaccine. The proactive support and guidance from Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has enabled approvals to this project. Our R&D and manufacturing teams worked tirelessly to deploy our proprietary technologies towards this platform.”In the two phases, experts test if a vaccine is safe to be administered in humans and to establish trends of its efficacy.There are 13 experimental vaccines in clinical trials and another 129 in the pre-clinical evaluation stage on June 22, according to World Health Organization’s draft landscape of Covid-19 vaccines on June 22.The company completed comprehensive pre-clinical studies in two months after receiving regulatory approvals. Results from these studies have been promising and show extensive safety and effective immune responses, the company said.“Our ongoing research and expertise in forecasting epidemics has enabled us to successfully manufacture a vaccine for the H1N1 pandemic. Continuing our focus on creating the only BSL-3 containment facilities for manufacturing and testing in India, Bharat Biotech is committed to advancing vaccine development as a matter of national importance to demonstrate India’s strength in handling future pandemics,” said Suchitra Ella, joint managing director, Bharat Biotech.ICMR-NIV managed to isolate the virus from swab samples in early February from initial Covid-19 patients in Kerala.“It normally takes about two-three months for the vaccine candidate to be ready, and then different studies are undertaken to test the vaccine candidate. The next phase of trials will be equally crucial,” said an ICMR official, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-by-bharat-biotech-first-to-get-human-trials-nod/story-Ha2bWTuHXIgh7xPDr6AyfN.html
30-06-2020||India||Plasma therapy helps stabilise Covid patients, shows trial at Lok Nayak||Plasma therapy has helped in stabilising the respiratory rate, improving oxygen saturation and reducing chances of organ failure in ICU patients of the coronavirus disease, showed the results from a small trial conducted at Delhi’s Lok Nayak Hospital, according to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office on Monday.The data reinforces the promise of plasma therapy, a process in which blood rich in antibodies from a Covid-19 recovered patient is transfused into the body of someone still struggling with the virus, in helping avert deaths due to the viral disease. Kejriwal on Monday announced the Capital will soon have a dedicated bank to pool in plasma from recovered patients. Of the 29 Covid-19 patients enrolled for the trial at Lok Nayak, 14 were given convalescent plasma from other recovered patients and 15 were administered fresh frozen plasma without any therapeutic benefit. The initial results show that respiratory rate came down, oxygen saturation improved and their sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, a yardstick that predicts ICU mortality, also improved in the patients who were given convalescent plasma.The average respiratory rate of the patients selected for the trial was just over 35 (normal is 12 to 20 breaths per minute), which reduced to about 27 breaths in 48 hours, and was closer to the normal 20 in seven days. This was much better than those who were given the plasma without therapeutic benefit.Similarly, the oxygen saturation went up by 6.6 percentage points within 48 hours and 9.9% in seven days in patients given convalescent plasma. The SOFA score came down by 1.8 in patients given convalescent plasma as opposed to 0.6 in those in the control group within 48 hours. This score reduced by 4.5 in patients given convalescent plasma as opposed to 3.7 in the other group. Higher the score the likelier it is that a person will die.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageDuration of ICU stay as well as hospital stay was also less in patients who were given convalescent plasma.Lok Nayak hospital was the first to receive a nod for plasma therapy trial in India.“The findings of the trial are yet to be published. However, preliminary evidence shows that it improves the oxygen saturation and reduces organ failure scores in patients if administered at the right time. This might improve mortality rates, however, none of the studies globally have proved survival benefits so far. Plasma therapy remains one of the most potentially beneficial treatments for Covid-19 if given at the right time,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, which partnered with Lok Nayak hospital for the trial.Before announcing the setting up of a plasma bank, Kejriwal had last week described plasma therapy as one of the five weapons that Delhi has in its fight against coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The plasma bank – which will operate largely like a blood bank – will be set up in the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) hospital in south Delhi.When the condition of Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain started deteriorating, he too was administered the therapy. He has now recovered from the infection.IDENTIFYING RECIPIENTSCurrently, plasma therapy is an experimental treatment that the government has allowed only in moderately ill patients whose oxygen requirement does not go down despite providing oxygen support and steroids.International studies so far have shown that the therapy is safe, with less than 1% adverse outcomes such as transfusion reactions, in a study of 20,000 patients who received the therapy in the US, according to Mayo Clinic Proceedings. However, it does not establish the efficacy of the therapy. Another study of 10 patients published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences from China showed that plasma therapy may lower severity of disease, aid recovery of liver and lung function, and reduce inflammation.“If plasma therapy is administered at the replicative stage, it can neutralise some of the virus and prevent the disease from progressing onto critical stages. It should preferably be given before a person reaches a stage where they have to be put on a ventilator. If organ failure has already started or the lungs have been damaged, then the therapy may not be very helpful,” Sarin said.At Max hospital, which was the first to actually administer the therapy, 50 people have received it under the multi-centre clinical trial being spearheaded by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). In this, patient parameters – such as the complications, number of days spent on the ventilator, oxygen requirement -- is compared to a control group that did not receive plasma therapy. “However, the revised clinical guidelines by the health ministry in mid-June has allowed the use of the therapy to the particular category of patients even without registering for the clinical trials. About 15 or so patients have received the therapy outside of the trial,” said Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director, Max Healthcare.The therapy is also not effective in people who already have a high level of antibody. “When the infection enters a person’s system, they start developing the antibodies against it too. I think we are the only hospital to test the antibody level of the recipient along with that of the donor. If a person already has high levels of antibodies (more than 641), then adding more antibodies to it may not be helpful,” said Dr Sarin.DONOR CHALLENGESAcross India, 321,735 people have recovered from the infection, and over 50,000 in Delhi alone, as on Sunday. However, getting a plasma donor is still a challenge for many with social media and WhatsApp becoming their last resort to find a donor.This has also led to scams such as the one where 23-year-old man who duped Delhi assembly speaker Ram Niwas Goel and a friend who were looking for a plasma donor. A man claiming to be a doctor from city’s government hospital agreed to donate plasma but asked for cab fare. The man stopped returning his calls afterwards.Kejriwal on Monday said the bank will streamline the plasma therapy system in the city. He said the government is working out on the modalities of the plasma bank and they will be finalised in the next two days.Meanwhile, hospitals are doing their best to motivate patients who have been discharged to come back and donate plasma to help others.“We counsel all Covid-19 patients at the time of discharge to come back in two weeks to donate plasma. We keep a record of these patients and call them when someone is in need of plasma. However, we do not get enough donations at the moment to let us create a bank for convalescent plasma. The patients also reach out on social media, there are various organisations that have stepped in to help as well. But there is a gap in demand and supply. For example, one website that connects donors and recipients received requests for plasma from 700 people and only 150 willing donors in a week. And, only 50 of the 150 were eligible to donate after screening,” said Dr Budhiraja.Finding the patient’s blood type in stock is also a challenge, said Dr Sushma Bhatnagar, head of the Covid-19 services at AIIMS, Jhajjar. “We do have some donor plasma in our blood bank; but we do not always find the patient’s blood type in stock. What we do then is start calling the patients who have recovered from the hospital and ask them to come and donate the plasma. I think, counselling the patients has an important role to play. If it is done properly at the time of discharge, people are more likely to come back,” said Dr Bhatnagar.The Delhi government created a bank of about 200 samples, but finds it tough to replenish it.“Collecting plasma from those who have recovered remains a challenge, with them not wanting to come back to hospitals. So, it is essential that we take the technology to them. Just like blood donation drives, the government can conduct plasma collection drives in the containment areas where many cases are being reported. A plasmapheresis machine (a device that takes blood out of the body, separates the components, and reinfuses components other than plasma back into the body) can easily be carried in a van or stationed at a dispensary for the collection,” said Sr Sarin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plasma-therapy-helps-stabilise-covid-patients-shows-trial-at-lok-nayak/story-bloR1Zq7RmFGTOhwCdde5H.html
30-06-2020||India||Police not trained enough in human rights, reveal surveys||New Delhi: The custodial deaths of a father and son in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi district -- it has created a nationwide uproar with the family blaming police torture -- is not an isolated incident. Crime records and survey reports show that violence by police has been reported across the nation, that police personnel are not adequately trained in human rights, and that they have the tendency to inflict punishments outside the judicial process.According to the latest Crime in India report by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 70 people died in police custody in 2018. Tamil Nadu recorded 12 of these deaths, the second-highest in the country after Gujarat, where 14 such deaths were reported. Only three of these 70 deaths were categorised by the police as having occurred due to physical assault by police, while illness was registered as a cause of death in 32 of the 70 cases. Seventeen of these deaths were attributed to suicide, seven to injuries sustained prior to police custody, seven while escaping from custody, one to road accidents or journeys connected with investigation while the remaining three to other reasons. In 2019, at least 117 deaths in police custody were reported to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). But, according to a report released last week by the National Campaign Against Torture, a joint initiative by multiple non-governmental organisations, deaths in police custody occur primarily as a result of torture. Of the 125 deaths in police custody that the group recorded in 2019, 93 persons (or three in every four) died due to alleged torture or foul play; while 24 died in suspicious circumstances, with the police claiming they either committed suicide or died of illness or accident. The report also said that the practice of torturing suspects in police custody to punish them, gather information, extract confessions, or demand bribes, was rampant. In terms of police personnel being punished for alleged torture and extrajudicial killings, NCRB data for 2018 shows that even as 89 cases were registered against police personnel for human rights violations such as custodial killings and illegal detentions, not a single one was convicted of the crime. Of these 89 cases -- three cases were registered for custodial deaths, three for torture leading to injury, four for encounter killings, 17 for extortion, one for illegal detention and 61 for other kinds of human rights violations.While nine police personnel were arrested in connection with cases of custodial death, and one was arrested for torture leading to injuries, a charge sheet was filed in just one case till the NCRB report was compiled.Findings from the Status of Policing in India report, released last year by non-governmental organisations Common Cause and CSDS-Lokniti, showed that the police in India suffers from inadequacies and biases which might lead to such behaviour. The report was based on a survey of close to 12,000 police personnel across 21 states.The report showed that 12% police personnel never receive human rights training. This varied among states and was as high as 38% in Bihar, 31% in Assam and 19% in India’s most populous state Uttar Pradesh. Even among the personnel who received training in human rights, a majority said it was only at the time of joining the police force. The study said this was also true for those who were in the police force for more than five years.The survey also found a large number of police personnel justified the use of extrajudicial measures against criminals. Three in every four police personnel surveyed felt it was justified for the police to be violent towards criminals, while one in five felt that killing dangerous criminals was better than a legal trial. More educated police personnel, who are more likely to be officers, were found to be more likely to believe that it was alright for the police to be violent towards criminals.“This has become a very scary situation,” said former director general of police, Vikram Singh, regarding the number of custodial deaths being reported each year. “The most scary dimension is the fact that nobody has been punished in the 100-odd police custodial deaths in the year 2018 and the year before. The cases aren’t being pursued rigorously, and if you don’t pursue cases rigorously, the witnesses turn hostile, and it gives a sense of impunity to policemen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-not-trained-enough-in-human-rights-reveal-surveys/story-Cbr9cc4oOYlCZGR48aaQWO.html
30-06-2020||India||Skill ministry plans to train 300,000 migrants||The union skill development ministry has chalked out a plan to train at least 300,000 migrant workers who have returned to their home states since March in an attempt to help them upgrade their skills and possibly earn more, according to documents seen by Hindustan Times. The training will be offered under the Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyaan. The special job programme, kickstarted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 20, primarily aims to provide jobs in projects worth Rs 50,000 crore but it also has a training component for unskilled daily wage workers. At a meeting on June 16 and 17, the union skill ministry spoke to different states, asking them to identify 300,000 daily wage wagers willing to take two crash courses on skill development.The training for unskilled workers will be given under two heads: “1.5 lakh migrant workers under Short Term Training (STT) and another 1.5 lakh in Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL),” said a skill ministry order on June 22.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageWhile STT is typically 300-500 hours of training depending on the job role, RPL varies from 12 hours to 80 hours of training. In its bid to meet the target, the government has also allowed states to reduce the short courses and shift them to recognition programmes. The skill minister has told the states that “In such case, against surrendered target of 1 STT, 3 additional RPL targets may be taken.”State and district administrations have been requested to identify and map the skills of “reverse migrants” and identify their interest in skilling courses. The states will also do survey of the eligible enterprises for apprenticeship at district levels.Under the Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyaan, the government will provide jobs across 116 districts—with at least 25,000 returnee migrant labourers—spread across 6 states. A skill ministry official said the ministry is hopeful to meet these targets in the stipulated time (125 days) as considerable progress has been made on skill mapping of migrant workers, identification of job roles for training and survey of establishments for apprenticeship.Former rural development secretary Jugal Kishore Mohapatra maintained, “I think if they are targeting skill upgradation of 3 lakh workers that’s a modest and doable target. My guess is eventually 80-90% migrant workers will return to big cities but the rest would stay back. The skill programme will be helpful for all as a skilled labour can claim more wages.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/skill-ministry-plans-to-train-300-000-migrants/story-vuGLUKnDrtveyBAhCOumEM.html
30-06-2020||India||IRCTC sacks 500 contractual workers||Indian railways’ catering and tourism arm IRCTC (Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation) has decided to terminate the contract of more than 500 contractual workers. However, its board may reconsider the decision, officials said. In a letter to all railway zones dated June 25, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times, IRCTC informed all its zonal offices that there was no requirement for these contractual workers under the present circumstances and they be given one month notice and their contracts terminated. “The requirement of supervisor (hospitality) engaged on contract basis has been reviewed in the revised catering model and it has been decided that under the present circumstances, services of supervisor (hospitality), engaged on contract basis are no more required,” the letter stated. IRCTC hired around 560 supervisors for hospitality in 2018. The decision to terminate the contracts is currently under reconsideration. “The matter is being reconsider and the IRCTC board will be taking the decision,” an IRCTC spokesperson said. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe former contractual employees who were handed the termination letter took to social media to seek intervention from railway minister Piyush Goyal. “What about our job…Are we not human or we don’t have family to take care them, We all are 500 Hospitality Supervisor of IRCTC on contractual basis which has been hired for the contract of 2 year. But completing our contract, we got termination,” Bicky Sahni said in a tweet addressed to the minister. Another former worker, Rahul Kumar, tweeted “Sir, I am working in IRCTC as hospitality supervisor but unfortunately now IRCTC decided to terminate all supervisors in huge quantity from pan India so we will be jobless now, Family depends on us. Please do the needful for us. Shall be thankful sir.” Hospitality supervisors work to monitor the operations of the pantry car on trains and their work includes monitoring the preparation of food, food quality inspection, passenger and handling passenger complaints. Regular passenger train services have been suspended since March 22 when the first phase of the lockdown was announced. At present, only 230 special passenger trains are operating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/irctc-could-sack-500-contract-staff/story-Hwzs0kU7J04goMjrXVetxM.html
30-06-2020||India||Zero demand for Shramik Specials now: Rail ministry||As many as 4,596 Shramik special trains have ferried over 6.2 million migrant workers till Saturday and there has since been no demand for them, the railway ministry said on Monday, and added it will operate them if they are requested to.The trains were started from May 1 to ferry workers left jobless by the Covid-19 lockdown to their home states. The railways on Friday said many of them have begun going back to the places where they worked and added it indicates the economic activity has begun picking up after India began easing the lockdown this month.“Railways ran 4,596 Shramik trains till June 27. There was zero demand from states yesterday [Sunday] and even tomorrow [Tuesday]. Apart from only one train running today [Monday] from Bangalore to Muzaffarpur, there are no trains in the pipeline. We will run them whenever state governments demand within 24 hours,” a railway ministry spokesperson said.The Supreme Court this month directed the railways to provide special trains within 24 hours if demand comes from state governments. The ministry had also written to states asking them whether they needed rains to ferry the remaining migrants.HT on June 3 reported the special trains may be on their final leg of operation with demand for them reducing from the states. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the country’s most populous states, have received the maximum number of these trains--1,723 and 1,680--followed by Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal. The two big states accounted for nearly 75% of trains ferrying migrants back. West Bengal accounted for 282 trains.Trains returning from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal have been booked 100% from June 26 to June 30, according to railway ministry data. It indicates a return of migrants, who had gone back to their home states.The railways is running 15 pairs of Rajdhani trains connecting Delhi with different parts of the country and 100 pairs of long-distance trains, which began on June 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zero-demand-for-shramik-specials-now-rail-ministry/story-9dsYA1jitXVhAvwJtvtdTL.html

The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has mobilised troops, weapons and equipment to areas across the Depsang plains near DBO, with its forward presence aimed at disrupting the army’s patrolling patterns there.The navy’s P-8I maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft have been used for surveillance of the Ladakh sector, while their primary role encompasses carrying out anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance of the oceans, said a third person aware of the matter. The P-8Is carried out similar surveillance missions during the 2017 Doklam standoff.Apart from Sukhoi-30s and upgraded MiG-29 fighter jets, IAF is operating Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters --- both imported from the US --- in the region even as forward air bases have been ordered to be on their highest state of alert to deal with any Chinese provocation.Experts said India’s deployment in the sector --- in response to the Chinese military buildup --- was adequate to handle any adventurism or aggressive moves by the northern neighbour.“A very balanced and formidable mix of Russian and new Western equipment has been deployed by the Indian military in the Ladakh sector to deal with any eventuality,” said former IAF chief Air Chief Marshal Fali H Major (retd).The army has deployed its new US-origin M777 ultra-light howitzers, which can provide accurate artillery fire support in mountainous terrain, in eastern Ladakh. The 155 mm/39-caliber M777 howitzers, inducted only last year, can be sling-loaded to helicopters and swiftly deployed to high-altitude areas. The howitzers have a range of 24-30 km.The Russian equipment Air Chief Marshal Major referred to includes Sukhoi-30 fighters, MiG-29 jets, Ilyushin-76 heavy-lift planes, An-32 transport planes, Mi-17 utility helicopters, T-72/T-90 tanks and BMP-2/2K infantry combat vehicles.India has also ordered more stocks of Excalibur precision guided munitions from the US for its artillery guns, while Russia assured swifter delivery of weapons and ammunition during defence minister Rajnath Singh’s visit to Moscow last week, said the fourth person cited above. India is pushing Russia to speed up the delivery of S-400 Triumf air defence missile systems following the tense stand-off with China. New Delhi is keen to accelerate the purchase of a mix of 33 more MiG-29s and Sukhoi-30s from Russia, and is also looking at sourcing an operational surface-to-air missile system from Israel as a 2017 order worth $2 billion for such advanced systems to take down hostile aircraft and missiles hasn’t translated into deliveries yet, he added.India has deployed its air defence weapon systems, including the indigenous Akash, in the Ladakh region where tensions rose sharply after a brutal brawl in Galwan Valley left 20 Indian and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers dead on June 15, as reported by HT on Sunday.Both India and China have significantly reinforced their deployments with fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, heavy artillery and missiles in the region. The Indian armed forces have given the government details of critical purchases they need to make keeping in mind that the border stand-off could last weeks or even months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/weapon-systems-bought-from-us-an-integral-part-of-arsenal/story-1PhbP1M72Rg0UKeZiG4GJO.html
30-06-2020||India||PM Narendra Modi to address nation at 4pm today||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation at 4pm on Tuesday, the PMO said in a tweet without saying what the address would be about. Prime Minister @narendramodi will address the nation at 4 PM tomorrow.The PMO’s tweet came shortly after the government announced that it was banning 59 mobile phone apps linked to China that it said were prejudicial to India’s sovereignty, defence, security and public order.It also followed the announcement of the Union home ministry’s Unlock 2 guidelines that seeks to open up more activities outside containment zones from July 1 amid the Covid-19 pandemic.In his Mann Ki Baat radio address on Sunday, Modi said India is much better placed than many other nations with respect to the fight against the pandemic and that the country’s recovery rate is rising.India’s Covid-19 tally stands at almost 5.5 lakh.PM Modi’s address will come amid an ongoing stand-off between India and China at Ladakh’s Galwan valley. Military commanders of India and China are scheduled to meet again on Tuesday to explore means to disengage.Modi in his Mann Ki Baat radio address had praised Indian soldiers who died in a clash with Chinese troops in Galwan valley on the night of June 15 that sparked outrage in the country.The Prime Minister did not name China in his Mann Ki Baat address when he said that Indian soldiers had given a befitting reply to those who coveted Indian territory.The Opposition, particularly the Congress which has claimed that Chinese troops have intruded into Indian territory, has been demanding that the PM should openly condemn China’s aggression.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-to-address-nation-tomorrow-amid-stand-off-with-china/story-OlB5H31PZd43G7dmb8eqQK.html
30-06-2020||India||Indian, Chinese armies set for Ladakh meeting||Indian and Chinese army delegations, led by corps commanders, will hold a meeting at Chushul in Ladakh on Tuesday in their third attempt to make some headway in implementing a daunting disengagement plan aimed at gradually reducing tensions aggravated by a significant military build-up on both sides of the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), people familiar with developments said on Monday, speaking on the condition of anonymity.The two delegations, led by an Indian lieutenant general and his Chinese counterpart, last met on June 22 --- exactly a week after the brutal Galwan Valley clash --- and hammered out a consensus on disengaging from friction points along the disputed border.The “mutual consensus to disengage” from all “friction areas” reached a week ago at the meeting between Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region, has not resulted in any form of disengagement or thinning of the military build-up by rival forces in the region, said one of persons cited above.In what was seen as a rare meeting, the two senior officers first met on June 6 to reduce border tensions. The limited military disengagement that began in some friction areas after the first meeting was derailed after the bloodshed in Galwan Valley on June 15.On Tuesday, the Indian side is expected to reiterate its demand for the pullback of Chinese troops from the friction points and seek the restoration of status quo ante (early April) in key areas including Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley and the strategic Depsang plains, said a second person.Experts were not optimistic about what the latest meeting could potentially achieve, especially against the backdrop of continuing Chinese military buildup observed on the ground and captured by satellite imagery. “The purpose of these meetings is to initiate disengagement on the ground at the military level before de-escalation can happen at the strategic level through diplomatic channels. The Chinese are playing hardball and one can’t exactly predict the outcome of these meetings between senior commanders,” said Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd), a former Northern Army commander.The June 30 meeting is expected to begin at 10.30 am at Chushul on the Indian side of the LAC, said the second person. The previous two meetings were held at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC.China has not halted — and instead ramped up — its military activity in Galwan Valley, Depsang Plains and the Finger Area near Pangong Tso after the senior officers met on June 22, he added.Both India and China have significantly reinforced their deployments with thousands of soldiers, fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, heavy artillery, missiles and air defence systems in the region that has garnered extensive global attention in recent weeks, particularly after the Galwan skirmish that left 20 Indian and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers dead.India is especially concerned about the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) holding positions in the Finger Area of Pangong Tso where the PLA has set up permanent bunkers, pillboxes, tented camps and observation posts in areas New Delhi considers its territory, said a third person. The situation is equally critical from the Indian standpoint in the Depsang sector as the PLA has mobilised troops, weapons and other military equipment in sensitive areas, with its forward presence disrupting the army’s patrolling patterns there, he added.The Depsang plains lie south of Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) in a strategic area near the Karakoram pass that the military calls Sub-Sector North and any military moves here by the Chinese forces could threaten a key stretch of the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldi road, experts said.The Chinese buildup in other areas including Galwan Valley and the Gogra Post-Hot Springs sector hasn’t thinned either. Satellite imagery dated June 22, released by US firm Maxar Technologies, shows not only is the PLA holding ground in Galwan Valley but has also shored up its military positions in the area, as reported by Hindustan Times on June 25.The PLA’s armoured vehicles and artillery units remain deployed in Chinese areas facing the Gogra Post-Hot Springs area along the contested border. The Indian military is keeping a strict vigil along the LAC and has raised its guard to respond to any eventuality, the third official cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-to-hold-lt-general-level-talks-on-tuesday-on-lac-standoff/story-3iQ25gZPyncus1BxQx8cpN.html
30-06-2020||India||HT Salutes: Odia actor helping migrants get home||Soon after the lockdown was announced in March, famous Odia film actor Sabyasachi Mishra received a message on Twitter from Dhariti Patra, a Mumbai resident. Patra’s mother was a cancer patient and was due to be operated in AIIMS Bhubaneswar on March 28, but before it could happen, the hospital turned all its resources towards managing the Covid-19 pandemic. Desperate, 21-year-old Patra tweeted to the 35-year-old actor to help her mother get the treatment she needed. She also tweeted to the Odia chief minister Naveen Patnaik and Odia actor-turned-Member of Parliament Anubhav Mohanty on March 28.“Everyone thinks movie actors can work miracles in real life, but it does not happen that way. So I ignored the messages. But a few days later, I thought if I can help her in any way, let me try,” said Mishra, an engineer-turned-actor, who came into prominence with the Odia movie Pagal Premi in 2007. Mishra contacted a private hospital in Bhubaneswar and arranged for the mother’s transportation from her village in Ganjam district, Odisha, to the capital city, where she underwent chemotherapy. “When [Patra] called up from Mumbai to say she can never forget the help, I felt I can be of some help to people apart from entertaining them in movies,” said Mishra.“I had become desperate as AIIMS had refused to operate my mother. I was in Mumbai and could not travel due to lockdown. Though I had tweeted to CM and BJD MP Anubhav Mohanty, I did not get any help. Luckily, Sabyasachi bhai saw the tweet and decided to help out. I can’t be thankful enough,” Patra said.Two and half months later, Mishra, who is known for his romantic lover-boy roles, has helped thousands of migrant workers. Turning his home into a control room, he coordinated the return of Odia migrant workers from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, among others, several of whom had already started their journey back on foot. Since May 11, the actor has helped transport close to 3000 people through buses, trains, flights and car. “The biggest loss that [the migrants] have suffered is loss of willpower and dignity. They think they will die walking. It’s important to talk to them,” he said. It started on May 11 when the actor received a message on social media from Rosalin Mishra, a student of Central Sanskrit University in Rajasthan seeking help for 80 stranded students there. “It was beyond my imagination to handle the arrangements for buses, getting travel permits and passes for inter-state borders. Initially, bus owners were reluctant to travel to Odisha and they wanted more money. But that was sorted out eventually,” Mishra said. Mishra hired two buses to ferry the students between Jaipur and Bhubaneswar on May 21, and paid the tickets of those who couldn’t arrange for their own fare. People began to get in touch with Mishra over social media. Mishra said that keeps his laptop and mobile phone on at all times. Rosalin now helps manage his social media profiles as well. Together with two other students, they trawl through Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, and communicate with people seeking Mishra’s help. “Last week, I coordinated the return of 44 girl migrant workers from Odisha who had lost their jobs in Kerala and were desparate to come back,” she said.On May 31, Pandarinath Bidar, a photo journalist in Bangalore saw a labourer named Pradip Tandi, sitting on the skywalk of the Majestic bus stand. Tandi had been out of work for two months, and his landlord had evicted him and his family. “I alerted the local youth Congress workers who made food and lodging arrangements for them. I also posted a video of the labourer and his family on Twitter which Sabyasachi Mishra saw and sought details for helping them,” Bidar said. Mishra bought seven air tickets for Tandi, his paralysed mother, and other members of his family. Between June 10 and 14, he coordinated the return of 120 girls from three districts of Odisha who were working in garment factories in Tirupur and Coimbatore and were unable to return after the lockdown began.Mishra said that he has set an expenditure target of Rs 20 lakh for philanthropic activities and he is about to reach that amount. Luckily, people are also keen to help out, and Mishra is directing them to his trust, which he set up last year.“Though film actors do reach out to people in times of natural distress, Sabyasachi has gone several steps ahead. What is creditable is he has done it when the film industry has had no business and actors are unlikely to get any work for quite some time due to lockdown issues. He has set the bar high for everyone,” Odisha Cine Artistes Association president Kuna Tripathy said.Noted sand artist Sudarshan Patnaik recently made a sand illustration in praise of Mishra’s efforts at the Puri beach.Recently on Twitter, when someone tagged Sonu Sood – the Bollywood actor who had helped migrants leave the city by organising buses for them – another user tagged Mishra. “Brother.. when you have wishes of the entire nation with you then nothing is impossible. We will make sure everyone reaches back to their family. Yes bhai can’t wait to meet you. Keep the good work going,” Sood replied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odia-actor-helping-migrants-get-home/story-rIh4Ea2ro57Z0GZnl6TT2O.html
30-06-2020||India||HT Salutes: When business turned into charity||For 29-year-old entrepreneurs Sukriti Sharma and Nitin Gaur, the penny dropped when they saw an old woman sitting by the roadside in the last week of March – shortly after the lockdown was announced -- while driving up to their milk processing plant located at Nakraunda in this Uttarakhand town.“We stepped out from our car and asked her why she was outside during the lockdown and all she said was that she had not eaten for five days. She must have been working as a house maid and that incident really moved us,” Sharma recalled.Gaur and Sharma own Moo Day, a milk production plant that processes and sells full cream, toned milk and cow milk. Started last April with an initial investment of Rs 45 lakh, their turnover was around Rs 6 lakh a month. They hadn’t quite broken even, but they were close. Then the lockdown began, and they lost the bulk of their clients – hotels and restaurants. Watch | HT Salutes: Dehradun duo who distribute free milk packets across the cityTheir turnover dipped to Rs 4.5 lakh a month, Sharma said. Though the bulk of the milk that they process comes from her family’s cattle farm situated on the outskirts of Dehradun, with almost 250 Holstein Friesian cows, they also sourced milk from local farmers. This stopped too.By all measures, things were bad and about to get worse. “The initial days of lockdown due to Covid-19 had been really tragic for the entire world,” Sharma said. Meeting the old woman, however, made the two of them think about how their processing plant could be put to better use, albeit without any monetary benefit.Gaur reached out to his friends who worked as social activists in the city, and through them, he got in touch with non-governmental organisations, and took their help to distribute Moo Day milk packets and biscuits, free of cost, to the hungry.“Eventually through word of mouth, more people learnt about what we were doing and contacted us for help. We started distributing milk pouches daily in different areas across Dehradun,” said Gaur.In their own plant, they said, they made arrangements for their 11 workers and employees to stay at the farm. Those who visited the markets frequently -- to take orders of day-to-day milk requirement from retail shops or departmental stores -- were either asked to work provided safety kits, Sharma said. Neha Joshi, a social activist who has been involved in helping locals and stranded migrants during the lockdown said, “We used to distribute food amongst people initially and then we got in touch with Nitin and Sukriti. With their efforts we were able to distribute more items. Small gestures like this, giving milk packets, biscuits and bread at times, helped a lot of people in ways we cannot even imagine.”“There were different kinds of restrictions and limitations that we had during the lockdown, but we were able to work it out. Coming across that old lady on that road, we realised that it is not always about profit and that we had to help people in whatever manner we could. We are glad that we were a part of essential services through which we were able to help those in need,” Gaur said.Since June 6, Uttarakhand has imposed lockdown in Dehradun on weekends, so Sharma and Gaur have restricted distributing the milk packets on weekdays only. Their main clients – restaurants and hotels – remain shut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-salutes-when-business-turned-into-charity/story-mKXoNG5TxGPaIt6qhzDzJK.html
30-06-2020||India||HT Salutes: A zoologist who saved birds from dying of hunger||Three weeks into the lockdown imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the sudden death of around 30 birds, mostly crows, over two days (April 11 and 12) within and around the Smt Chandibai Himathmal Mansukhani (CHM) College campus in Ulhasnagar, Thane district, came as a shock for college staff and residents.The college principal Manju Pathak explained that prior to the lockdown, birds used to feed on leftovers of the college canteen, and grains left daily by commuters on roads that run along the periphery of the college located opposite Ulhasnagar railway station. “Following the lockdown, this stopped. On April 11 two birds died, and a day later 24 more including crows and pigeons were found dead across the campus. A veterinarian who had conducted a post mortem on one of the birds told us that they died owing to the lack of food and water,” Pathak said. Watch | HT Salutes: Ulhasnagar resident who makes bird feeder out of waste productsOn April 11, when Sarita Khanchandani, 43, a zoologist and former school teacher learnt about the incident, she contacted the college principal and asked permission to set up bird feeders inside the college.In the weeks that followed, only one more bird died, Pathak said.However, Khanchandani was still perturbed. “I needed to do something more for the species that cannot voice their concerns,” she said.Khanchandani managed to acquire plastic containers and pet bottles from local grocers while collecting melamine or plastic plates from hotels and restaurants. She also collected wires and cables. With this plastic refuse, Khanchandani made 541 bird feeders over the course of the next two months.“It’s a simple concept,” she said. “You drill a hole in the centre of the plate. Then plastic containers are attached on top using nut bolts. By making a few more holes on either side of the container or bottle, a bunch of cables or wires are passed through them to ensure they are sturdy when hung from trees or elevated areas. Next, feeders were filled with millet or rice grains.”With the help of local security staff and teenagers from her colony, she installed these feeders across Ulhasnagar, Ambernath, and a few more areas of Thane district.“We ensured these feeders were placed in areas generally frequented by birds. We received videos from [residents] and realised not just birds but even squirrels were using them.”Such efforts mainly help make people aware of the responsibility we have as citizens, said experts. “Historically, the architecture of houses were such that were nooks and crannies around homes where birds could make nests, and people would leave grains but as cities became more cosmopolitan, the architecture changed, reducing space for them,” said Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra. “She (Khanchandani) has done a stupendous job by setting up feeders across numerous locations acting as stopovers for birds, and ensuring they don’t run out of food or water.”Of the common birds found across cities, more than crows, pigeons had trouble finding food during the lockdown, said Deepak Apte, director, Bombay Natural History Society adding, “Such efforts need to be encouraged as they are hands on engagement with nature, and creating much needed attention to protect our feathered friends.”“Khanchandani’s efforts are a reminder for all of us for doing a tad bit more away from our daily lives for so many species dependent on us,” Pathak said.

30-06-2020||India||HT Salutes: Students turn teachers for migrants’ children on university campus lawns||For 24-year-old Ishita Choudhary, persuading her parents to let her leave home was the most challenging task she faced. The rest of it, which included teaching a motley group of among 40 youngsters on the lawns of Panjab University’s campus, was simpler, she said.Choudhary is among a handful of centre for social work students, who have been teaching the children of migrant workers living in campus since May 24. The idea came from their teacher, Gaurav Gaur, and the initiative is called Kalam, Kitab aur Khwahishien (which translates to pen, book and dreams).Over 280 workers, who hail from Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and others, have been living in makeshift accommodations inside the campus to construct a multi-purpose auditorium, a girls hostel and the second floor of the Centre for Public Health. Unlike several migrants who returned home after the lockdown was imposed on March 25, this group stayed put.ALSO WATCH | HT Salutes: Panjab University students who teach migrants’ kids amid lockdownMany of their children, who are aged between 3 and 16 year, are school drop-outs; some attended classes at a government school in sector 25, which was shut down due to the lockdown. Though online classes were held for senior students of Chandigarh’s government schools from April 21, the construction workers’ children had no access to internet, and thus, no school. Besides Choudhury, Shubham Singh, Narendra Singh, Jaskirat Kaur Saini, Noyonika Roy and Kavneet Singh have been teaching the students in different parts of the campus, spread across sectors 14 and 25. Initially, the classes were for a couple of hours in the morning; now they hold four-hour long classes, from 8am to noon. “I had never thought that I could teach anyone but now my self-perception has changed,” said Choudhury, who taught who taught English and Hindi. The shade of an expansive banyan tree and empty cement bags make up for the absence of classrooms and chairs. All children have handkerchiefs tied over their faces.“At this time no one will allow us to use a classroom,” said Choudhary, who favours the trees outside the legal studies institute in the main campus.“In the morning their parents wait for us to come and then leave for work. Even you cannot be late for class, otherwise the children demand an apology,” Shubham Singh, 24, said.The social work students are also trying to teach the youngsters about Covid-19; the children have a host of queries about the pandemic that has affected millions worldwide, starting with what the virus looks likeand why do they need to wash their hands repeatedly. Gaur, an assistant professor at the centre for social work, said that volunteer work is exactly what the course is about. “I hope they will bring a change in the future of all these children.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-salutes-students-turn-teachers-for-migrants-children-on-university-campus-lawns/story-lK2Hp4vwKXnVL0AU5lyobJ.html
30-06-2020||India||HT Salutes: A student-led network of volunteers solves crises||Debojit Thakur was already part of a transcontinental network when the pandemic hit. A student from Kolkata with years of experience in volunteer relief work, he was pursuing a PhD at the University of Trier in Germany, and was in the middle of a research trip to Delhi when the borders closed in March.Still, when he and a few friends decided to post a message on Facebook on March 29, inviting donations to help feed those rendered jobless and homeless, they were not expecting the response they got.“People from the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and across Europe, most of them students, sent in money,” said Thakur, 29. “And those who couldn’t spare money were generous with their time, their help, and with spreading the word.”Watch | HT Salutes: Debojit Thakur, a researcher who helped Covid & Amphan victimsWithin weeks, a network of 650 volunteers had emerged, spread across Delhi and West Bengal. Thakur decided to call it the Quarantined Student-Youth Network (QSYN).They set up 26 makeshift kitchens and have so far distributed over 10,000 ration packages and served over 100,000 cooked meals. Then the Amphan cyclone alerts began. The initiative had already raised Rs 12 lakh for migrant relief in Delhi by the time the cyclone hit West Bengal on May 20. The group decided to put out a fresh call for help, and money began to pour in even faster. Bollywood got wind of the bunch of youngsters doing good work, and celebrities like Ayushmann Khurrana, Varun Grover, Ishan Khattar and Ananya Pandey shared their details on Instagram Stories, inviting people to pitch in. By May 27, the group had collected Rs 60 lakh. By June 14, it had jumped to Rs 95 lakh, and QSYN had begun using the crowd-funding website Ketto.org, for greater ease and transparency.The direct, grassroots approach and real-time updates on Facebook inspired confidence. “I donated because I could the work they were doing, directly with the people,” says Dip Nag, 33, a cyber-security manager in Munich.School children donated Rs 10 or sometimes Rs 50. “One professor sold some of his art and raised almost Rs 2 lakh. Samay Raina, a Mumbai-based stand-up comic, did an online benefit show and raised Rs 5 lakh for us. The list goes on,” Thakur said.Now, just ensuring accountability, data collection and presentation so that everyone knows where the money is going, has become a full day’s work.Nadia Imam, 23, an alumnus of Jadavpur University, has volunteered to head that arm. “It’s a humongous task,” she said. “Many migrant workers are coming home to southern West Bengal to find their houses were hit by the cyclone. So now we’ve begun helping with rebuilding too, and that’s whole different set of materials and tools and volunteering. And we’re doing this in six districts across the region.”Locally, some donations have come in the form of supplies. Many farmers handed over vegetables at massive discounts, and were happy to do so because they didn’t have markets to sell them at.Because of their pre-existing network, QSYN volunteers were among the first teams to reach some of the worst-affected areas of southern West Bengal. Some of their volunteers in the Sundarbans were coordinating ration distribution while repairing their own homes. They distributed tarpaulin and cooked meals from makeshift kitchens as part of their relief efforts. With donations still coming in, QSYN plan to now help support the school- and college-going children of migrant workers returning home from other states as well.“My friends and I used to volunteer under the banner Students of Bengal. We contributed to relief work after the Nepal earthquake in 2015 and the floods in Kerala last year. In the lockdown, with the millions being affected, I realised we had to build a stronger network. That’s how QSYN was born,” said Thakur. “We plan to keep it going till all the money is gone. We are not an NGO but we will have to decide what to do in the future, because this is a good thing we’ve started. Maybe we can figure that out when we actually can meet in person.”Hindustan Times and Facebook have partnered to bring you the next 15 stories of HT Salutes.

30-06-2020||India||HT Salutes: From slim pickings to plum sales, how a fisherman used tech to beat lockdown||Five days into the lockdown, fisherman Ganesh Nakhawa, 32, was sitting down to a lunch of fish curry and rice, and sent a picture to a friend in Mumbai. ‘You should sell these in the city. We have no fish here,’ the friend texted back.Luckily, that fisherman in Karanja, Raigad, had a degree in business studies from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland; and his friend, Myron Mendes, was communications manager at an NGO where he helps run campaigns for a living.Mendes got permission from his housing society to coordinate orders and connected with other housing societies to offer that cherished thing in Mumbai — and rare treat in the lockdown — fresh fish straight from the fisherman.Watch | HT Salutes: 3 youngsters helping Maharashtra fishermen amid lockdownTwo days later, Nakhawa, armed with an e-pass (fish was an essential service in the food category) loaded 25kg of the day’s catch into the boot of his car and drove 90 minutes to Mumbai. Two hours on, as Nakhawa puts it, his car was empty and his pockets full.Back home, he spread the word and 15 other families joined in. He drove back later that week with 100kg of fish, then 150 (he had to take out the back seat to make room). At a time when fisherfolk all along the coast were being forced to stay home or dump the bulk of their catch because supply chains had shut and — more crucially — the ice factories had closed, he had found a way for his community to thrive.There were so many orders that Nakhawa got to indulge his love for Excel spreadsheets—orders placed, orders filled, orders pending, orders for next week. Customers began calling from so far away, they had to turn some down.By the second week, Nakhawa realised this could be scaled up further. As director of the Karanja Fishing Co-operative Society, he took his model to the people. Earnings had fallen by now, by about 25%, and most fisherfolk were taking their boats out only every two or three days. Given the already-slim margins of their business, many were becoming desperate.Nakhawa suggested they throw their lot in with him, leverage technology to balance supply, demand and pricing, and create an entire supply chain on their own.The co-operative society partnered with Numer8, a data analytics firm. All orders were funnelled through a single WhatsApp number. They called themselves BluCatch — a name that Nakhawa had trademarked in 2017, when he first tried to use a similar online model, but saw it fail due mainly to lack of scale.This time, using their own vans and cars (and later a few rented tempos) and tying up with online delivery platforms, they rushed their fish to homes across the city. By the third week of April, BluCatch had around 600 fisherfolk across Raigad and Mumbai selling over 3,000 kg of fish a day.Eliminating the middleman has meant they can keep more of their margins, and earnings have risen by as much as 35% over pre-lockdown levels. Earnings from each carload are transferred back to each fisher family on the same day.“I don’t have to worry. And I don’t have to wait for weeks for my money to come in. They are working more to be ready for a post-pandemic world and I am going to be with them,” says Karanja fisherman Vinayak Patil, 41.If there’s one downside, it’s that managing the whole supply chain is exhausting. “Most of us haven’t slept in two months,” Nakhawa says. “I’ve slept in my car, at the harbour, at friends’ homes.”But for Nakhawa, it is a dream coming true. He quit a job in investment banking in the UK in 2011, to return to his Koli community and become a seventh-generation fisherman. “What the lockdown has done is show us that it is sustainable,” he says. “Right now, only about 5% of Koli men with another career choice opt to go into fishing. The number is higher among women, but still no more than 30%. I want more youth coming in. And now I hope they will.”(Hindustan Times and Facebook have partnered to bring you the next 15 stories of HT Salutes.

30-06-2020||Editorials||Extending PMGKY is the right step | HT Editorial||In his address to the nation on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the government is extending free ration to 800 millions Indians up to November under the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY). In addition to 5kg of rice or wheat per family member, the beneficiaries will also get 1kg of gram, an important source of protein, per month. This decision deserves appreciation. As Covid-19 cases continue to surge, any immediate economic recovery, and therefore, restoration of incomes is unlikely. Ensuring food security for all has to be the first priority in such a situation.While 60% of India’s population will benefit from the programme, it will also generate economic benefits beyond preventing hunger. It will make sure that poor workers do not see a collapse in their bargaining power. Savings on food spending — India’s poor spend more than half of their household budget on food — will also give a boost to non-food demand. This will be crucial for bringing the non-farm economy back on track. The State should remain vigilant that farm incomes do not suffer due to excess production leading to a collapse in prices of food items, which are not included in the free ration scheme. Given the weakness in aggregate demand, this cannot be ruled out. To be sure, today’s announcement also had politics in mind. The PM mentioned Chhath, the most important festival in Bihar, which is due for elections at the end of the year. While this has drawn criticism, and speculating on motives is always hazardous, in a democracy, there is nothing wrong in politics driving augmentation of welfare. The challenge now is implementation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/extending-pmgky-is-the-right-step/story-IupwQW0YnWo99jKoEt0RlL.html

But India’s app ban, and related restrictions on telecom hardware and mobile handsets, is based on the recognition that data streams and digital technology are a new currency of global power. They also take aim at one of China’s most ambitious goals, namely to become the digital superpower of the 21st century. The apps were not the most important or most insidious example of how Beijing was accumulating influence in this sector. But purging a Chinese browser like UC, number one among Indian phone users, sends a warning that worse things may follow — e-commerce and digital payment restrictions, data movement regulations, and bans on 5G telecom equipment.India has warned China of “consequences” if the status quo ante is not restored on the border. Beijing has not backed down yet, despite the military movements, diplomatic warnings and trade measures already taken. Multiple points of pressure need to be applied on many levels and over a long period of time. Digital action is only one of them. The app ban is a straightforward way to signal intent and leave room for escalation. China, India and most developed countries recognise that the next source of economic growth lies in the digital economy, that its raw material is data, and that whoever decides standards and builds the electronic backbone will have enormous advantages over everyone else. India has been relatively open to all players. China long ago drove out most foreign apps and software. Western countries have begun clipping the wings of Chinese products over security and privacy concerns. India was among the few large markets where Chinese apps were on par, if not ahead of its US counterparts. That edge has now been lost, possibly forever, in a market where numbers matter.To be sure, there must be a recognition that India cannot afford to sever all its economic links with the world’s second-largest economy, even in the digital space. Chinese finance is presently essential to sustaining India’s start-up economy. Much of the present telecom infrastructure of the country is from China and cannot be replaced without enormous disruption. Threats that are double-edged are not credible and will only weaken India’s negotiating position. Which is why, though New Delhi will need to take many more actions on many more fronts to impose costs on Beijing, these actions must be weighed on scales of both smartness and strength.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/imposing-costs-on-china/story-eHMEhBnWDBHyBXyPqLQR2J.html
30-06-2020||Editorials||To deal with China, understand it better||There is now no doubt that China will remain India’s greatest strategic threat in the decades to come. Beijing is not just interested in taking control of strategic areas or in stopping India’s infrastructure build-up at the border. As is visible in the statements emerging from retired officials and its State-controlled media, China wants to send a message to India — to accept Chinese dominance in the Asian hierarchy of power, stop deepening the partnership with the United States, and reconcile to a curtailed global role . New Delhi cannot do this, for its own national interests are at stake. While there is a need for a diplomatic reset, enhanced military capabilities and economic policies to reduce dependence on China, one other area which requires greater investment is the expertise on China in India. India is too dependent on a very limited set of retired diplomats and military officials who have engaged with China, select intelligence officials and diplomats who speak Mandarin, and a small set of academics outside government. This is not tenable. To understand Chinese motivations better, India needs more experts on the decision-making apparatus in China, the functioning of the Chinese Communist Party, the dynamic between the party and the People’s Liberation Army, China’s economic drivers and changing social dynamics, and its quest for digital dominance. For this, India must invest in language training, field visits, fellowships, and dedicated institutes. To battle China, understand it better.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/to-deal-with-china-understand-it-better/story-2LCVvLfUR8UIYJPiBmGFcJ.html
30-06-2020||Editorials||How Nepal’s PM is harming ties||Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is back to his old tricks, or, to be more precise, two inter-related tricks of jingoistic anti-Indian nationalism and internal anti-Madhesi chauvinism. The first tool in his playbook is building up resentment against India, ramping up nationalistic fervour, and projecting himself as the saviour of the Nepali nation which India is out to target. The passage of an amendment to ratify a new Nepali map with territory claimed and controlled by India was one recent step in this direction. His claim on Sunday that India is out to topple his government — with no evidence — is another step.Two, Mr Oli also taps into a mindset which sees the Madhesis — Nepali citizens of the southern plains, the Tarai — who share extensive kinship ties with people across the border in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, as a “fifth column”, more loyal to India than to Nepal. This is why he ensured that the Constitution did not have equitable power-sharing arrangements. And that is why Nepali ultra-nationalists portray extensive cross-border marriages as somewhat dangerous to Nepal and its current demography — conspiracy theories of Nepal’s “Fiji-isation” and eventual “Sikkim-isation” are conjured up. A current bill in Nepal’s parliament, which would make it more difficult for those who have married Nepali citizens from obtaining citizenship is a step in this direction and will deal a blow to the close people-to-people ties between the two countries.These two tricks are essential for Mr Oli to overcome his real political challenges. His government has been an abysmal failure in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. He faces challenges from within his own party. Despite a strong mandate, he has done little to deliver on his promise of economic development. And he presides over one of the most corrupt governments in Nepal in recent years, with crony capitalism at its peak. He also gets away because of the backing of the one external power that is today micro-managing Nepali politics, and saved his government by mediating between internal communist party factions just two months ago: China. If Mr Oli is truly a nationalist, he should worry about the Chinese penetration in every sphere of the Nepali polity. But that won’t happen. India needs to keep a careful watch on developments in Nepal, recognise the threat Mr Oli poses, quietly work with its friends and allies in Kathmandu to build a more inclusive polity, let the communist government collapse under the weight of its contradictions, and make it clear that with his actions and statements, PM Oli has left little scope for meaningful engagement||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/how-nepal-s-pm-is-harming-ties/story-gartG6Lc6nWioq75yHLn6N.html
