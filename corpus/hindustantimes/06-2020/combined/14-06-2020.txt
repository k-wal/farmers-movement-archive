14-06-2020||News||The NDA’s false parenthood claim, writes Abhishek Manu Singhvi||In addition to its diverse achievements as the world’s largest social welfare programme, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has the unique accomplishment, which has got highlighted in the wake of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), of getting new putative fathers and mothers, new ownership and inventorship claims, and the twin triumphs of wisdom by hindsight and selective amnesia.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s ministers and eminent functionaries are living down the Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s jibe of “monumental failure” against his present jewel in the crown, the MGNREGS, by semantic hair-splitting that he meant to improve and enlarge it. Still others are characterising the current MGNREGS debate as a desperate attempt by Sonia Gandhi to claim false ownership. They forget that the same “monumental failure” jibe was repeatedly recast by today’s ruling powers of today, and members and chairperson of the erstwhile National Advisory Council (NAC), which conceptualised MGNREGS, were called “jholawallahs”. Why should those who are derisively classified by the current political masters as “urban Naxals,” “Left-leaning armchair socialists/communists”, the “Khan Market gang” or “Lutyens’ elite,” not take credit for something which neither the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) nor the BJP, nor even the Congress thought of for six decades, is beyond comprehension. Some government critics tend to use words that suggest that the Congress and NAC claims to it are akin to admitting to a crime.The scale of MGNREGS is huge. As of March 31, this legally guaranteed provision of work upon demand (a singularly innovative concept in itself) to anyone in designated rural areas, has, from inception, touched the lives of 120 million people, provided 1,200 crore of person days of employment, paid out wages aggregating thousands of crore, spread over 1.46 million diverse items of rural work, of which 60% are complete, up and running. It is not surprising, because for the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) and NAC, programmes such as the Right to Information, the mid-day meal scheme, the National Rural Health Mission, the food security Act, among others, were articles of faith, not opportunistic ploys.Equally amusing is the reference by the eminence grises of the government to ownership claims of platforms such as the Jan Dhan Yojana as the reason for MGNREGS’s success. They omit the affectionate terms of endearment their own leaders used for the seminal Aadhaar scheme, which has been operational since 2009. Despite Aadhaar being the heart and soul of the Direct Benefit Transfers (DBTs), it was termed by BJP legislator Meenakshi Lekhi as a “fraud” programme in 2012, adding: “This is a dangerous programme to regularise the illegal stay of migrants in the country. Is Bharat Mata so open to illegal migrants?” The late Ananth Kumar argued: “If you illegally enter other countries, you are shot at or put in jail. But if anyone illegally enters India, he is given citizenship. This is the contribution of Aadhaar....Aadhaar is the biggest fraud in the country.” Such opportunistic political gaffes, whether qua MGNREGS or Aadhaar or the Goods and Services Tax will continue to haunt their authors, despite the fragility of institutional memory.Individual opportunism apart, institutional memory cannot efface the admitted fact that DBT was started in January 2013, and was formally announced in the budget of 2013. Fact checkers who trashed the BJP’s claims of authorship of DBT were ignored, and in 2017 PM claimed: “We started direct benefit transfer scheme. This resulted in money reaching to its rightful owner. We successfully eliminated middlemen.”The government has rightly allocated an additional Rs 40,000 crore as a Covid-19 fiscal stimulus to MGNREGS. Indeed, this is one of its main fiscal, Covid-19 components, while 90% of the remaining is misleading monetary policy, supply side announcements, clumsily camouflaged as being a fiscal stimulus. The UPA government kept increasing allocations every year to MGNREGS since its inception. In FY 2009-10, Rs 16,000 crore was allocated to the scheme. The next year, it was increased by 150% to Rs 39,100 crore. This government’s apologists who are misleading the national discourse should point out a single year of such significant increase by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the last six years. It appears that Modi 1.0 and 2.0 have averaged an annual 12.8% increase in MGNREGS allocation, which is much less than the lowest increase by UPA 1 and 2.American author Maxine Kingston rightly said: “In a time of destruction, create something.” The original parents of such beneficial social welfare schemes have no problem if their success spawns new parents and new ownership. But during the “destruction” wrought by the virus, why is this government maintaining a strategic silence regarding the increase of MGNREGS’ from 100 days to 200? Why are we not at least attempting to move closer to universally paying minimum wages under MGNREGS? Why is the government not clearing its dues of Rs 16,000 crore, which reduces its actual claimed MGNREGS package of one lakh crore rupees to Rs 84,000 crore? Why are ministers hiding the fact that instead of 100 days, the ground reality suggests the fulfilment of barely 75 days in many cases, even 50 in some? Why can the government not enhance the boundaries of this successful scheme to six months or to the end of the pandemic? Why has this fear of fiscal deficit and/or the terror of downgrades by rating agencies paralysed this government, which does not seem to be aware of elementary concepts such as monetising debt to liberally fund lifeline schemes such as MGNREGS?It is only when you achieve, even partially, the above imperatively urgent reforms to MGNREGS that the nation will at least consider recognising you as adoptive, not biological, parents of the scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-nda-s-false-parenthood-claim/story-jDiG5nX9MeQ08NKNNCgpMO.html
14-06-2020||News||UAE stands with India and Indian expatriates||Of the more than 200 nationalities that form the diverse and tolerant society we cherish in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it is difficult to think of a single expatriate community that has contributed more to building the fabric of our nation than people from India. UAE and India enjoy a shared history that pre-dates the world’s geopolitical boundaries as we know them today. Migration, trade and cultural interchange between our peoples go back centuries. The strong relations between our governments have allowed these ties to flourish. The entrepreneurship and work ethic of Indians is known, indeed admired globally. In UAE, this business acumen has given the country some of its most recognised brands such as the Lulu Hypermarkets, Jumbo Electronics, GEMS Education, and the Landmark Group. Culturally, UAE is the richer for the enormous contributions the people from India have made to our diversity through religion, food, cinema, art, education, and, of course, cricket. Indian expatriates have been involved in the rapid evolution of UAE’s economy. Apart from constituting a large number of white collar professionals, they also provide the bulk of the country’s manual labour force. It is no exaggeration to state that UAE would not be the successful and prosperous nation it is today without their help. Like all good partnerships, this is a symbiotic relationship. UAE has provided fertile ground to make a good living. It has invested heavily in providing an environment that is business-friendly as well as tolerant, open, welcoming, and safe. Last year, AED 169 billion ($46 billion) in remittances flowed out of UAE — more than half of it into the countries of South Asia, of these India primarily. This remittance flow is the second highest in the world. In these past few months, the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has rocked the economies of the world, including our own. Many businesses have been forced to temporarily close and most air routes suspended. In all countries, expatriate workers tend to be the most vulnerable to economic shocks, and UAE government is aware of its duty of caring for its large expatriate workforce. I want to assure you that we are doing everything we can to support workers during this difficult time. Our priority is health and well-being, including providing free Covid-19 testing and free medical treatment for anyone who requires it, regardless of legal status, occupation or nationality. Those who test positive are moved to high-quality isolation facilities to continue their treatment while not infecting others.The UAE government has legislated to ensure that the most vulnerable of workers continue to receive food and accommodation, even if they are temporarily out of work, and has introduced measures to provide financial support to them and their families. A nationwide Ten Million Meals campaign was underway during Ramadan to ensure no one in UAE went hungry. The government has also granted automatic extensions of all visas, including residency and work permits. Those who are currently unable to work in their chosen field can register to participate in an online labour market where employees can take temporary job assignments without impacting their employment rights or status. Some workers will prefer to return to their home countries during these uncertain times.We have been working with many governments to assist in this . We have facilitated the return of a large number of people to their homes countries. Since the Indian government began its repatriation process on May 7, hundreds of special flights have seen tens of thousands return from UAE, with more flights being added weekly.I would like to personally thank the Indian government for its cooperation and friendship. We very much hope that this is “see you soon” however, and not goodbye — an Early Leave Initiative allows workers who wish to return home temporarily to take leave entitlements or leave without pay while having their terms of employment held open until their return. UAE’s leadership has provided assurances that our economy is well poised to bounce back once the pandemic eases. We are fortunate to possess the infrastructure, resources, and the determination to bring about a speedy recovery. In the meantime, work goes on in many sectors. Construction and large-scale infrastructure projects continue. Freight logistics services are perhaps more important than ever. And it isn’t just our society we are working hard to support. UAE is also making significant humanitarian aid contributions during Covid-19, supplying more than 570 tonnes of medical equipment and other supplies to more than 50 nations, including those of South Asia. This is a global crisis and we can only recover from it if we work together. While the current situation may seem bleak, we are both forward-thinking and optimistic nations that have thrived following bigger challenges than Covid-19. I have no doubt that we will emerge more resilient from this crisis, and that UAE will continue to be a place of opportunity and tolerance for Indian migrants and indeed all those who want to build a better life, both for themselves and the wider world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/uae-stands-with-india-and-indian-expatriates/story-xGu3Q0mXrMMJIsZZRooLmJ.html

14-06-2020||Chandigarh||Bathinda cotton farmers adopting bed plantation technique to reap benefits||Progressive cotton farmers in Bathinda district have taken to unconventional narrow raised bed technique. According to information, about 3,500 hectares in the district is under this system of cotton cultivation that is considered useful in weed control, saving water and reducing crop lodging.The state agriculture department has recognised the novel initiative taken by the farmers. Officials are following it minutely with a plan to promote the cost-efficient technique from the next year in the cotton-sowing area the already semi-arid districts of south Malwa.Farmers say the water-efficient technology of bed plantation supports the cash crop as power supply remains erratic to run tubewells to irrigate cotton fields when the period coincides with the paddy cultivation. Ramgarh Bhunder village, about 25km from district headquarters, is considered as a leader in adopting bed cropping technique.Gurpreet Singh, 39, said he has been sowing cotton on raised beds since 2015 and the almost entire village has switched over to this technique. This year, he has sown cotton on five acres with bed plantation.“Against the average use of three packets of seeds per acre, I sowed only two. Most of us find hand sowing as preferred practice. Groundwater in the area is brackish and with limited access to canal water, but the average per acre production of cotton is 14 quintal that is higher than the conventional level cropping fields,” he said.Another cotton grower Harjoginder from the adjoining Kot Fatta village has enhanced bed plantation from 4 acres in 2016 to 17 acres this year.“Water requirement for raised cotton fields is just one-fourth of the traditional irrigation practice. The cropping pattern does not allow the growth of weeds in the fields as the water stays only in raised beds,” he said.For Jagtar Singh of Mehma Sarja village, bed plantation shows negligible plant mortality. “In the last four years, I have not experienced serious lodging as excess rainwater drains out easily. The pattern can be instrumental in the conservation of groundwater that is depleting at the alarming levels,” he said.According to the state agriculture secretary Kahan Singh Pannu, after DSR (direct seeding of rice), bed plantation adoption by farmers can be a game-changer for the cotton-growing belt.“Inspite of pandemic outbreak, we managed to expedite crop diversification drive and this year, cotton has been sown on 4.9 lakh hectares, an increase of one lakh hectares than last year. The department is working to promote such efficient technologies in other districts as well,” said Pannu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bathinda-cotton-farmers-adopting-bed-plantation-technique-to-reap-benefits/story-YioHxMDyS5dL2zBdtl6a0L.html
14-06-2020||City||Faridabad: RWAs directed to ensure entry, exit from one gate only||Gurugram: The deputy commissioner of Faridabad has issued an order asking the resident welfare association (RWA) members to keep only one entry and exit open for the movement of people as well as vehicles in residential areas.According to the DC’s order, the decision has been in light of the rise in the number of coronavirus (Covid-19) cases in the district. On Sunday, at least 191 new cases were reported in the district in the past 24 hours, taking Faridabad’s tally to 1,277. Yashpal Yadav, deputy commissioner, Faridabad, stated in his order: “In exercise of powers granted to me by the virtue of ‘The Haryana Epidemic Disease, Covid-19 regulations 2020 notified under Epidemic Disease Act, 1897 and Disasters Management Act 2005 do herby empower elected RWAs to take the necessary steps. “The RWAs have to ensure single entry and exit for persons and vehicles in a cohesive geographic unit to monitor the movement of people. Temperature screening of the residents is mandatory and imposition of night curfew from 9pm to 5am,” he said.Yadav said concerned station house officers will assist the RWAs in this exercise.Anyone found violating orders will be booked under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, relevant sections of Disaster Management Act, 2005, and Epidemic Disease Act, the order said.Yadav said these orders are being issued ex-part because of an emergent situation created due to the prevalence of the coronavirus pandemic.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, Faridabad, asked the city residents to strictly follow lockdown guidelines, particularly the night curfew, as it is mandated to make sure people observe social distancing to prevent the coronavirus disease from spreading. “We are requesting residents to follow guidelines for coronavirus and not to move without face masks else we will take strict action,” he said.Police said people who are venturing out without taking precautions are putting others at risk and they will be booked on the spot. Faridabad police on Sunday booked 284 people for not wearing facemasks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/faridabad-rwas-directed-to-ensure-entry-exit-from-one-gate-only/story-ude8k6pUYmuyBSsQEtiIqJ.html
14-06-2020||Chandigarh||5% of Punjab’s active cases: Low population density, multi-pronged strategy help southern Malwa dists curb virus spread||Even as Covid-19 cases continue to rise in Punjab, seven districts of southern Malwa — Faridkot, Bathinda, Moga, Fazilka, Muktsar, Ferozepur and Mansa — are less affected by the pandemic as only 39 (5.6%) of a total of 717 active cases in the state are from the belt.Officials claim that more than 70% of patients in these districts were those who returned from other states and the rest were their immediate contacts such as family members.A relatively less population density, a multi-pronged strategy adopted by the authorities and strict compliance of norms by people helped curb the virus spread, say officials. As per the state health department’s bulletin, only 419 (13.3%) of a total of 3,140 positive cases reported in the state have been reported from the seven districts.Moreover, 90% (380) of those found positive in these districts have recovered. Only one death was reported in the belt from Ferozepur. State Covid-19 spokesperson Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said apart from the efforts put by district administrations and the health department, another major reason behind the low spread of virus is less population density as the belt is predominantly rural.“The number of international travellers visiting these districts was relatively quite low. Amritsar, Jalandhar and Mohali are big cities and a lot of people came back there from high-risk areas, including abroad,” he added. “Most of the infected patients were with travel history. We put more than 2,000 Nanded-returnees and labourers from other districts in institutional quarantine. Faridkot is among the top districts when it comes to collecting samples per million population,” Faridkot deputy commissioner Kumar Saurabh Raj said. Fazilka deputy commissioner Arvind Pal Singh Sandhu claimed that a lot of effort and planning went into ensuring that local transmission does not start in the district, which also borders Rajasthan. “More than 90% positive patients came from other states,” he added. Fazilka senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harjeet Singh said only pass holders and good carriers are allowed to enter the district from Rajasthan. “As cases are increasing in Rajasthan, we are maintaining strict surveillance on the state border by covering 25 small entry points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/5-of-punjab-s-active-cases-low-population-density-multi-pronged-strategy-help-southern-malwa-dists-curb-virus-spread/story-junAf6AbowWNF7TAVbxrUP.html
14-06-2020||Gurugram||Teachers to focus on individualised education plans, student enrolment||The directorate of education has asked schools to ensure that they reach out to all students and get them to join online classes. With many migrants returning to their hometowns, the department has asked schools to focus on improving the dropout ratio and ensuring that they give new students attention and make efforts to connect with old students who might return.In a directive shared with school heads and teachers earlier this week, the department outlined a roadmap for various activities that need to be carried out during remote learning. Besides focusing on improving enrolment rates, the department has asked school teachers to create individualised education plans (IEP) keeping in view the minimum level of learning.Since the nationwide lockdown implemented on March 25 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), schools across the country have been suspended. The central government is scheduled to review the situation only next month. The Haryana government started the ‘Ghar se Padhao’ campaign on April 14 to ensure that teachers remain in regular contact with parents and students through WhatsApp during the lockdown. While teachers share academic videos and worksheets, students maintain a dedicated notebook to record their work.Suman Sharma, the principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, Urban Estate, said that more students had enrolled at school in the lockdown’s aftermath.“More students have enrolled during the lockdown. Many of these children used to study at private schools, but with physical classes getting suspended due to the pandemic and parents struggling to pay the fee, they moved them to government schools. Parents don’t see the point in paying the fee for online classes,” Sharma said.Some students have returned to their hometowns due to the pandemic. While some collected their school-leaving certificates before they left, schools have attempted to stay in touch with others who are expected to return.“Some students are going back to states like Bihar and Bengal. We have asked such parents to stay in touch with the teachers and ensure that their children take part in online classes. They can renew their admission when they return to the city,” Sharma said.Another government school principal, who didn’t wish to be named, said that while the government has asked schools to prepare teaching material in line with students’ learning levels and create individualised education plans, implementing them would be difficult with online classes taking place through WhatsApp. “In comparison to physical classes, online classes are restrictive. Most students are studying through WhatsApp, which is not the best platform for assessing students’ capabilities. We have, however, directed all teachers to take feedback and connect with students on phone calls to bridge the gap,” the school head said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/teachers-to-focus-on-individualised-education-plans-student-enrolment/story-waSDol09bTWTmRK4ANt29H.html

14-06-2020||City||Gurugram: Urban villages, residential colonies emerge as Covid hot spots||Gurugram: Some of the city’s urban villages and residential colonies on both sides of the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway are emerging as Covid-19 hot spots, shows the data collected by the contact tracing team of the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP). According to the data, in the last one week, urban villages such as Nathupur, Wazirabad, Tigra, Sukhrali, Mollahera, Dundahera, Naharpur Rupa, Chakkarpur and Manesar have witnessed a sudden spike in the Covid-19 cases. Among the urban colonies in the city, many new positive cases were reported from Chanderlok, Laxman Vihar, Om Nagar, Feroze Gandhi colony and Patel Nagar.The total Covid-19 cases in Gurugram till Saturday evening were 3,125, and the number has been rising for the past 10 days. The 25-member HSVP team started collecting data related to Covid patients since last Saturday after a reshuffle of officials was carried out by the district administration to manage the Covid-19 situation. Officials said that high density of population and resumption commercial activities in these urban clusters was the reason behind the rise in Covid-19 cases. On Friday The Gurugram health department had said that seven clusters that include Firoz Gandhi colony, Wazirabad, Lakshman Vihar, Chandelrok, Dundahera, Chakkarpur, and Gandhi Nagar have almost half of the Covid-19 positive cases in the city. The seven areas identified by the health department reported 1,600 cases till Saturday evening, said health officials. The HSVP team said that they were actively working with 36 primary health centres (PHCs) and rapid response teams in urban areas and sharing the information with the health department and the district administration. “We are gathering details of the Covid-19 patients and the data is updated on a mobile application, which ensures that information is shared on real-time basis and there is no duplication,” said Bharat Bhushan Gogia, HSVP’s estate officer one, who is the coordinating official for the data collecting work.A team member involved in the data collection said that they also check whether the patient has Covid-19 symptoms like fever, difficulty in breathing, and dry cough. “We collect these details from the PHCs in a single format and upload it online so that it is accessible to departments concerned,” he said.When asked what measures are being taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19 cases in the high risk areas, Gogia said that all of these had been turned into containment zones by the district administration. “The containment zones, which are under our supervision, are being monitored strictly. We are actively coordinating with the police officials deployed in these zones and a log book for entry of people is also being maintained,” he said.Meanwhile, the health department officials said that priority is being given to the high risk clusters and they plan to ramp up testing in these areas so that Covid affected persons are identified at the earliest. Virender Yadav, civil surgeon, Gurugram, said that the entire focus will be on the identified clusters in the coming weeks to prevent the spread of coronavirus. “Awareness campaign will be carried out on a large scale to send home the message of safety and prevention. Also, focus would be on ensuring strict home isolation and quarantine. A meeting of officials has been called on Monday in this regard.

14-06-2020||Chandigarh||Now, Akal Takht jathedar calls for forming Maharaja Ranjit-like polity||Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh has given a call for launching a democratic movement in Punjab to form a polity on the lines of the one formed by Maharaja Ranjit Singh who founded a Sikh kingdom which was annexed by the British in 1849. This comes nearly a week after the head priest of the Sikhism’s highest temporal seat made a statement in support of Khalistan as a separate Sikh nation if the government offered it, triggering a political storm in the state. In a statement issued from the Takht Damdama Sahib, Talwandi Sahib, late Saturday evening, he said, “As contemporary central governments discriminated against the Sikhs and betrayed them on the promises made before Independence, the sincere community leaders felt alienated and preferred to fight for concept of welfare state as enshrined in the Guru Granth Sahib. This was not a demonstration of spontaneous struggle or violent inclination, but a reaction to the government’s excesses.” “If Punjab has suffered from prolonged agony, genocide of Sikhs carried out by the government on the pretext of eliminating terrorism is mainly responsible for that. No parent wants their children to be killed in fake encounters and termed as terrorists,” he said.“Some political leaders are raking an unnecessary controversy over my earlier statement. The army’s attack on the holiest Sikh shrine ordered by the then Congress government and the brutal massacre of the community members encouraged the concept of true welfare state,” the jathedar added. “The Indian Constitution allows every Sikhs to exercise the right to lead a struggle to propagate the idea of justice in a peaceful and democratic manner,” the jathedar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/now-akal-takht-jathedar-calls-for-forming-maharaja-ranjit-like-polity/story-V7JmeDrvBpdAwLCndwxZ7I.html

14-06-2020||Chandigarh||Capt urges Modi to extend PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to extend the benefits under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) for another six months in view of the Covid-19 crisis to facilitate free wheat and pulses to the beneficiaries of National Food Security Act (NFSA).In a letter to the PM, Amarinder said the extension would go a long way in ensuring that the poor and the needy do not sleep hungry, and also enable them to make both ends meet.Noting that the early announcement of the PMGKAY had provided major relief to the poor NFSA beneficiaries during the difficult times of Covid-19, the CM said that the nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the virus had not only slowed down the country’s economy but also led to a major reduction in the incomes and savings of the people.Underlining the need to further extent the benefit, the CM pointed out that with the lockdown now touching almost three months, the economic situation of the people, especially the poor, had not improved much even after resumption of industrial activities in Punjab. Of the 2.6 lakh industrial units in the state, more than 2.32 lakh units had resumed operations, but the loss of wages over the past few months had severely crippled the purchasing power of the people, especially the poor NFSA beneficiaries, he said.Further, the number of Covid-19 cases was also seeing a steep upward trend daily after relaxations, and further lockdown and restrictions could not be ruled out, said Amarinder, adding that extension of PMGKAY for six months would be of immense help to the needy NFSA beneficiaries in these trying times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/capt-urges-modi-to-extend-pm-garib-kalyan-anna-yojana/story-Q6eF47aUZjL4sKwLkIJSOL.html

14-06-2020||Chandigarh||Weekend restrictions: Shops shut, roads wore deserted look in Punjab||All the shops, except those selling essential goods, remained closed across the state on Sunday with the state government imposing stricter lockdown restrictions on weekends. Roads in most parts of the state too wore a deserted look. The Punjab government on Thursday ordered stricter lockdown on the weekends and public holidays. The decision to tighten the curbs on weekends and holidays was taken amid apprehensions of Covid-19 reaching the community spread stage in Punjab and projections indicating that the peak in the state was still two months away.Cops were deployed in adequate numbers across the state for implementing the lockdown strictly, officials said. Inter-district movement was barred except for people with e-passes, they said, adding that no pass was required for such travel in case of a medical emergency.There was no rush of people in Ludhiana’s main markets of Jawahar Nagar, Kesar Ganj, Field Ganj, Sarabha Nagar and Chaura Bazaar. Reeling under losses, shopkeepers rued that business was slowly moving back on track, but the decision to impose a lockdown on weekends has hit the market badly. Seeking review of the orders, the market associations in old city areas are also contemplating an agitation against the state government. Though liquor vends and restaurants remained open, there were hardly any customers. There was a drastic decline in the footfall of devotees at the Golden Temple in the morning on the occasion of ‘Sangrand’ (beginning of new month). Amritsar is the worst Covid-19-hit district in Punjab with 600-plus positive cases.Though the district administration had allowed the opening of shops dealing with essential commodities till 7pm, a few establishments operated on Sunday. Heavy police force was deployed at every nook and corner of the city, especially at outside the markets leading to the Golden Temple. Petrol pumps also witnessed negligible customers. Similarly, the markets in Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur and Pathankot remained closed, barring liquor shops and those dealing with essential commodities.In Mohali, policemen were checking vehicles coming from Chandigarh and other parts.In Jalandhar, all markets, including Rainik Bazaar and Phagwara Gate, except shops dealing in essential goods remained closed in Jalandhar. The district remained Covid-19 hotspot with total 329 positive cases, second highest after Amritsar. Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, Punjab’s first coronavirus hotspot, too remained shut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/weekend-restrictions-shops-shut-roads-wore-deserted-look-in-punjab/story-wEleI0pWUGL8yMZGPtp98O.html
14-06-2020||Mumbai||3 tigers found dead in Tadoba in 5 days, forest department suspect poisoning||Two sub-adult tigers were found dead in the buffer area of the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) in Chandrapur, on Sunday afternoon by the forest department.Three carcasses have been recovered within five days after the decayed remains of a tigress was found last Wednesday morning (June 10). The two carcasses identified on Sunday were found 300 metres away from the one on Wednesday near Kondegaon talao, Moharli range in Tadoba buffer. “The tigers found on Sunday are most likely the sub-adult cubs of the tigress from last Wednesday,” said G Guruprasad, deputy conservator of forest (DCF), TATR buffer.At the same location where the tiger carcasses were recovered on Sunday, the carcasses of two langurs were also found, forest officials said. “We think one female and one male, but the bodies were highly decomposed. An enquiry is already underway and will be further escalated in nearby villages. The source of the suspected poisoning is unclear,” said NR Praveen, field director, TATR.Other forest officials said the carcasses were about five to six days old. Viscera samples of the tigress were collected on Wednesday itself and sent for forensic analysis to Nagpur.“The number of animals found dead indicate that they all may have died due to the same reason. Prima facie it appears that this may be a case of poisoning as no body parts were missing, which means poaching is ruled out. The carcasses do not have any injury marks; hence this is not the case of infighting,” said Guruprasad adding, “Their carcasses are even more putrefied than the mother. Based on the condition of the carcasses, we can say that the cubs are around eight months old.” Guruprasad added that the post-mortem results of the tigress earlier in the week showed that she had eaten a wild boar. “There is a possibility that the boar may have been poisoned or this could be a case of water poisoning. However, our enquiry is underway across three nearby villages,” he said.Surprisingly, no cattle kills have been recorded in this region for the past one year, the DCF said. “The area is non-forest land in the buffer of TATR but proximity to the adjoining core zone. The forensic analysis of all three tigers will reveal the final cause of death,” he said.Cases reported on Sunday take the tally of tiger deaths in Maharashtra this year to seven, of which six have been reported from Chandrapur, in and around TATR.Activists said the forest department and the chief wildlife warden (CWLW) needed to show the same alacrity in identifying culprits responsible for the death of the three tigers. “While the CWLW proposes to capture and sterilise tigers in Chandrapur, tigers are being killed under his watch by locals. Rather than issuing regular capture orders for sub-adult tigers, there needs to be proper evidence collection to ensure that the guilty don’t get bail and are punished,” said Sarita Subramaniam from Earth Brigade Foundation.A senior forest official said, “Poisoning of tigers was also a form of conflict, and all pros and cons need to be weighed before coming to conclusions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-tigers-found-dead-in-tadoba-in-5-days-forest-department-suspect-poisoning/story-vffhAarHWnbIV4gQ7Nl8yH.html

14-06-2020||Mumbai||After state, monsoon arrives in city||Although the city witnessed partly cloudy conditions through the day, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Sunday declared the onset of the southwest monsoon over Mumbai and remaining parts of Maharashtra. The monsoon arrived three days late in Mumbai from its normal onset date of June 11. Last year, the southwest monsoon arrived on June 25 – the most delayed onset in the past 45 years. In 2018, the monsoon arrived on June 9 and on June 12 in 2017. IMD said the northern limit of the monsoon passes from Surat Gujarat, Nandurbar in north Maharashtra, Betul and Seoni in Madhya Pradesh, and further covering parts of Bihar. “The onset has been declared over Mumbai and remaining parts of Maharashtra on Sunday. Since the onset was within the range of three days of June 11, it will be classified as normal onset for Mumbai and entire Maharashtra,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD.Monsoon entered the state on June 11 covering parts of south Konkan, south central Maharashtra and parts of Marathwada. On June 12 and 13, it further progressed covering more areas of central Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha, and by Sunday, it enveloped the entire state. The onset was declared based on the progression of the monsoon system and factors such as rainfall criteria and monsoon (westerly) winds at middle-troposphere level, said Mohaptra. “While the criteria is not as stringent as it is for Kerala, basic conditions were met for north Konkan district on Sunday. However, we must realise that onset is declared based on monsoon progression. For example, if Gujarat is witnessing more rain than Maharashtra, we cannot declare monsoon onset for Gujarat before Maharashtra,” he said.Independent meteorologists had conflicting views on whether conditions were favourable. “The wind pattern and the rainfall criteria have been met, which allowed IMD to declare onset. This time, it was a very soft onset. Usually, people think that onset should be declared only after heavy rain. That’s not the case. Onset criteria could very well be met with light to moderate rains as well,” said Sridhar Balasubramanian, associate professor, IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay.Between 8.30am on Saturday and 8.30am on Sunday, the suburbs and south Mumbai recorded 19.7mm and 11.2mm rain, respectively. IMD classifies moderate rain in the range of 7.6mm to 35.5mm. However, moderate to heavy showers were recorded in parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region such as Thane, Bhiwandi, Dombivli, Badlapur and Panvel over 24 hours.Independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, UK, Akshay Deoras said current conditions were not favourable for declaring the monsoon’s arrival in Mumbai, north Konkan and most of Maharashtra. “These areas continue to witness pre-monsoon thunderstorms. For the state, there needs to be near-surface monsoon winds from the west for declaring monsoon’s arrival. Such wind patterns are currently being observed over south Konkan districts only. Monsoon arrival in north Konkan, including Mumbai, is expected during June 15-16, when all factors are expected to be in place,” Deoras said.Private weather forecasting agency Skymet had earlier this month set June 13 as the onset date, but later revised it to June 14. Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet, said, “All conditions for onset were met on Sunday. Now, moderate to heavy rain is expected to pick up from Tuesday onwards till the next weekend.”IMD had issued a yellow alert for Mumbai, Thane and Palghar for Sunday, but these regions witnessed negligible rain till 8.30pm. An orange alert for heavy to very heavy rain has been predicted for Monday and Tuesday by the weather bureau for Mumbai and surrounding areas.The first two weeks of June saw the city cover 42% of the monthly rain comprising pre monsoon showers.

14-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab SC panel wants panchayats’ ‘anti-labour’ resolutions quashed||Taking serious note of ‘anti-labour’ resolutions recently passed by some Punjab panchayats, the state commission for Scheduled Castes has sought a report from the department of rural development and panchayats. Terming the resolutions illegal, the commission has also asked the department to scrap all such directions and submit an action-taken report by June 19. It may be mentioned that amid shortage of labour due to mass exodus of migrant labourers, the panchayats in several districts of Punjab had passed resolutions fixing wages for local labourers.As per these resolutions, farm labourers were to be paid ₹2,500 to ₹3,200 for sowing paddy on one acre, while the farmhands were demanding ₹4,000-₹4,500 per acre. “Not only constitutionally, it’s illegal socially and morally as well. The panchayats have no right to single out labourers, most of whom are from Dalit communities, and issue such diktats,” said commission chairperson Tejinder Kaur. The chairperson said the commission came to know that few panchayats have even refused to feed labourers and directed them to bring them their own utensils and food. “Who gave them (panchayats) the right to pass such resolutions, that too by making announcements on loud speakers? Further action will be taken once the department submits its report in this matter,” she added. The commission has specifically asked Sangrur deputy commissioner to conduct an inquiry into such resolution passed by Ghanauri Khurd panchayat, which threatened the labourers of social boycott if they demanded more rates than stipulated. “The Sangrur administration has been asked to submit a detailed report before the commission by June 19 through the sub divisional officer (civil) concerned,” the chairperson said.Punjab Khet Majdoor Union general secretary Lachhman Singh Sewewala said though it was a welcome step, the commission must ensure that strict action was taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-sc-panel-wants-panchayats-anti-labour-resolutions-quashed/story-ts63KwmMUA92tC0uVrtjeO.html
14-06-2020||Mumbai||Cyclone Nisarga: ₹200 crore worth property damaged in 13 tehsils, says Raigad collector||The district administration has carried out the final assessment of damages due to Cyclone Nisarga that left a trail of destruction on June 3, across Raigad district. Approximately, ₹200 crore worth government properties such as schools, hospitals, offices, anganwadis, electricity infrastructure etc. have been damaged, the district collector said.“We calculated a tally of 1.4 lakh houses were damaged. Additionally, 1.6 lakh tree-fall incidents were recorded, and damage to agricultural land and perennial crops across more than 20,000 hectares has been recorded, as per submissions by the district agriculture officers,” said Nidhi Choudhari, collector and district magistrate, Raigad.Nisarga, classified as severe cyclonic storm, made landfall at Diveagar, located between Shrivardhan and Murud between 12.15pm and 12.30pm on June 3 as it passed over Raigad district followed by heavy to very heavy rain over the next 10 days including the onset of the southwest monsoon. The wind speed during and after landfall had touched a maximum of 120 kmph, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had said, leading to rooftops of several structures blown away, tree fall and power line damages, and a communication blackout across 80% of Raigad. Partial damages to structures were calculated to be approximately 5.2 lakh, including government and private property, officials said.Destruction of electricity infrastructure has been immense, said Choudhari. “We have calculated approximate losses of ₹40 crore. Over 16,000 electric poles, high voltage lines, sub-stations, feeders, transformers etc. have been damaged,” she said.The cyclone affected 13 of 15 tehsils (Alibag, Murud, Tala, Srivardhan, Mangaon, Mhasala, Pen, Karjat, Mahad, Uran, Panvel, Khalapur, and Roha) with a total of 1,967 villages did not have power from June 3 to June 12, the collector said.“So far we have restored power for 950 of the 1,967 villages. As far as electricity consumers are concerned, power has been restored for over 50% across 13 of the 15 affected tehsils. Electricity has been restored for all tehsil headquarters and communication lines have been reinstated. However, work is still underway at two of the worst affected tehsils Murud and Shrivardhan. While it will take time to restore electricity for villages, we expect city areas will hopefully have power again by the end of this week,” said Choudhari. HT had reported on June 8 how residents of semi-urban and rural areas in affected talukas were facing a drinking water crisis due to damages to pipelines and power outage (failure in pumping water from bore wells). “We have managed to restore the supply of water across the majority of affected areas by providing generators even across remote villages under the regional water supply schemes. Remaining areas are being provided tankers to fill the village wells,” said Choudhari.Apart from ₹100 crore immediate relief sanctioned for the district, the state government on June 10 had announced damages to homes of cyclone-hit families would be given ₹1.5 lakh, ₹15,000 for partial damages to homes, ₹50,000 per hectare of damaged agricultural land, and ₹10,000 for damages to household materials. Research group to assess how mangroves protected Raigad during cycloneThe Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) will commence a study to assess how mangroves were affected during the severe cyclone Nisarga, and how much area the salt-tolerant trees managed to protect during the cyclone using satellite images. “We will independently carry out a study to understand the comparison of areas where mangroves were present and how they impacted property damage versus areas where they weren’t. Also, the scale of damages to the trees due to high wind speed. The study will be verified with on-site field visits subsequently,” said Deepak Apte, director, BNHS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cyclone-nisarga-200-crore-worth-property-damaged-in-13-tehsils-says-raigad-collector/story-d8soVwxrz4VaO8M41gszCK.html

Police said the girl’s body was recovered after the accused was arrested and he showed the spot.“The girl’s body was decomposed and as per the preliminary post-mortem report and inquiry, the accused was arrested under the charges of murder, rape and relevant section of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso),” said senior inspector Sandeep Bhagdikar of the Dongri police station.According to the police, the accused worked as a cook in a catering outlet and was a neighbour of the victim.

When the police learnt that the cook had left for UP, a team was dispatched to the accused’s native place in Bahraich district in Uttar Pradesh said Bhagdikar.“He was brought to Mumbai on Saturday. After an inquiry, the accused informed us that he killed her and dumped her body on the railway track in Wadi Bunder area,” added Bhagdikar. The accused was then taken to the spot and the girl’s decomposed body was found near the railway track. The body was sent for post-mortem.“The accused is changing his statements.

14-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab govt juggles improvement trust funds, Oppn cries foul||The Punjab local bodies department has decided to shift Rs 15 crore from Amritsar Improvement Trust to its cash-strapped Patiala counterpart, which is catering to development of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra’s constituencies.Captain wife’s Preneet Kaur is an MP from Patiala Lok Sabha seat. The move has raised the hackles of the opposition.The Patiala Improvement Trust is reeling under a debt of nearly Rs 70 crores. To make matters worse, most of its properties are attached in cases related to non-payments, making it difficult for banks to grant it loan.“The proposal has been approved by the director, local bodies department, and we have started process to shift the money, which we have generated by selling properties,” said AIT chairman Dinesh Bassi. He, however, added that it was a soft loan. “As per conditions, the PIT has to pay it back in next one and a half years with an interest rate of 9 %,”said Bassi.Notably, Mohindra had locked horns with Patiala mayor Sanjiv Bittu, a protégé of Preneet, and taken the development works of the Patiala rural constituency out of the MC’s purview in January. He had handed over the responsibility of these works to the PIT headed by his loyalist Sant Banga.The fund-starved PIT, however, could not float even a single tender since January. To bail out the trust, the department decided to give it some fund boost.Former local bodies minister and Amritsar BJP leader Anil Joshi termed the entire exercise as wrong. “How can they shift the money meant for development of the holy city to CM’s bastion. Funds are required to complete pending development works in Amritsar. We will oppose this move tooth and nail,” added Joshi. Mohindra, on his part, said: “It is not something new. The improvement trusts have been helping each other by giving loans. The proposal was mooted to bail out the PIT from financial crunch. Due to mismanagement of the SAD-BJP regime, most PIT properties are attached with banks, court and the tax department.” “Now, we will use this money to free such properties. The idea is to generate more funds by selling these properties as many of them have a high market value. I’m finding a way to revive the PIT, which will pay the amount back to the AIT with interest. It’s beneficial for both the trusts”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-govt-juggles-improvement-trust-funds-oppn-cries-foul/story-VEGEQ7SQmgFXDXhl2vTVVK.html

14-06-2020||Mumbai||Clinical trial of CAR-T technology to treat blood cancer to begin soon||A team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) and doctors from the Tata Memorial Centre (TMC), Mumbai, will soon start the first clinical trial of indigenously developed CAR-T technology in the country for the treatment of blood cancer.The central government’s National Biopharma Mission (NBM) -Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) has now approved ₹18.96 crore to the team for conducting a first-in-human phase-1/2 clinical trial of the CAR-T cells. The novel CAR-T cells will act are drugs that were indigenously developed at IIT Bombay by Rahul Purwar, a professor from the Bioscience and Bioengineering (BSBE) department. The design, development, and extensive pre-clinical testing was carried out in a laboratory with clinical inputs from Dr Gaurav Narula, professor of Pediatric Oncology and Health Sciences, and his team from TMC. The team has filed for national and international patents for the product.While the CAR-T cell technology is currently in use in developed nations with an intent to cure certain types of blood cancers, the technology is still unavailable in India. “One of the major reasons for its unavailability in India is that the drug is exorbitantly expensive. Pharmaceutical companies don’t see a market for such expensive treatments in India,” said Purwar. Two CAR-T products approved by the United States of America are Kymriah and Yescarta. However, the drugs could cost Rs5 crore per patient and could go up to ₹8 crore including hospital expenses.The IIT Bombay and TMC team are working on reducing this cost. “A large part of the manufacturing cost goes towards skilled labour. While we are at the initial stage, we will try to bring the costs significantly down,” said Purwar. The drug is aimed at treating leukaemia and lymphoma. The BIRAC, in its statement, said that with the success of the trial, the drug will benefit cancer patients, who currently are forced to opt for palliative care.With the grant in place, clinical trials of the novel CAR-T cells will commence at TMC. “Current treatment strategies, such as chemotherapy, are aimed at promoting life by a few months or years. They are not intended to cure cancer. The CAR-T cells have been fairly successful in this matter in some developed nations,” said Purwar. Unlike chemotherapy, this drug is administered only once to the patient.Dr Narula said that the clinical trial of the drug will be started in a trial set up where all variables are under control. “We have received the grant to start the trial. This is one step in a long process. We will start the trial as soon as the regulators give us a go-ahead,” he said. The team is now waiting for approval from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/clinical-trial-of-car-t-technology-to-treat-blood-cancer-to-begin-soon/story-1IeZ1E07a0MaIKxzVFghrI.html

Sukhdial Singh was declared negative for the virus during his treatment at Government Medical College (GMC), Amritsar, hours before his death on Friday. But he was declared positive for the disease after his post-mortem the next day. As if this was not enough, he was declared negative again after his cremation which was held while following the Covid-19 protocol. Only 3-4 family members, including the deceased’s son and daughter, were allowed to attend the ritual and that too with special operating procedure. The reports were tested at the GMC’s viral research diagnostic laboratory (VRDL). “This has left the whole family shattered. The health authorities were also responsible for not providing proper care during his treatment,” said Sukhwinder Singh, 60, a retired assistant engineer of the irrigation department and father-in-law of the Sukhdial’s son.He said, “I along with my son-in-law took Sukhdial to the Tarn Taran civil hospital on Thursday after he complained of some problem in his chest. He was referred to GMC after his samples were taken for Covid-19. His sample was collected there again and the report came negative.”“He was put on ventilator when his condition deteriorated. At around 9:30pm, we took him to a private hospital but he was declared brought dead. When we were preparing to bring his body back to Tarn Taran we got a call informing us that he tested positive for Covid-19. The health staff took the body directly to his native village Mugalwala in the Patti sub-division. Even our relatives were not allowed to see him for the last time,” he added. Atinderpal Singh (29), the deceased’s son, said, “How the same laboratory could give three different results in two days? We want a thorough probe into the matter.”His mother Palwinder Kaur said, “The health officials asked us to go for 14-day self-quarantine. Why should we quarantine ourselves if my husband’s report was negative?” Tarn Taran civil surgeon Dr Anoop Kumar said, “It was a mistake on the part of the laboratory.” GMC principal Dr Sujata Sharma said, “It was a clerical mistake by a data entry operator but it which was rectified later.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/contradictory-covid-reports-deprive-tarn-taran-asi-s-kin-of-performing-his-last-rites-properly/story-tdoOraXVElt5tezrn4Bu2H.html

Kishtwar DC said that the work on the re-alignment has ensured the employment of locals along with the development of the Kishtwar region. “It will also increase the tourism potential of the Padder subdivision and Pangi valley of Himachal Pradesh thus boosting the socio-economic development of the entire region,” he added.It is pertinent to mention here that the road passes through rough mountain terrain with overhanging half tunneling stretches, mostly in hard rock strata.

Tenders are to floated within a week, said officials privy to the development.“The allotment of work will be done soon,” said MC commissioner KK Yadav, adding that a six-month target has been set to ensure that by the next summer, the additional water storage capacity becomes operational at the Sector-39 waterworks reservoir.The move is important for ensuring continuous water supply to the city. At present, the Sector-39 waterworks, which receives supply from the Kajauli waterworks and takes care of the city’s demand, has underground water storage capacity of only half a day. While water stored in the morning is supplied to the city in the evening, the evening storage is supplied in the morning.With the peak water demand in summers touching 120-125 million gallons per day (MGD), the current availability of 90-95 MGD was found inadequate, as it led to low water pressure. The supply is also hit if there is any disruption in supply from the Kajauli waterworks due to pipe leakages or maintenance works.The long-pending work got the go ahead after Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) on June 10 agreed to give Rs 11 crore to the MC for the purpose. The MC had approved Rs 38 crore for the project, but with only Rs 27 crore available for it, the project hadn’t taken off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-water-storage-capacity-set-to-double-in-six-months/story-RNrA3UhW1jZrStQMsiUaKK.html
14-06-2020||City||Akal Takht chief says his ‘Khalistan’ remarks misinterpreted to incite Sikhs through social media||Days after making remarks that every “Sikh wants Khalistan”, acting Jathedar of the Akhal Takht has said that the comments he made were misinterpreted.In a fresh statement issued yesterday from Talwani Sabo in Punjab’s Bathinda, Giani Harpreet Singh said, “Many adverse agencies are making attempts to mislead the youth by misinterpreting his meaningful statement. Such adverse forces are doing this for their political benefit by pushing Sikh on the path of terrorism and inciting Sikhs through social media.”The Jathedar, or leader, of Sikh’s highest temporal seat Akal Takht, added that those who are spewing venom against Sikhs are followers of same hate politics and terrorism.Banned radical groups, which are operating from overseas, played up the statement made by Jathedar as a propaganda tool to stir up the sentiments on social media creating a flutter in various circuits.However, clarifying his stand, the Jathedar cautioned Sikh and urged them to be cautious and aware of such elements, who want to push Sikhs on the path of violence.“In fact, my statement has hurt those who want to define Sikh with false and hateful idea forcibly attached to the political ideology of Khalistan, people want to satisfy their bosses by inciting them on social media. Beware of such people and create a political movement within the democratic structure so that people from all walks of life in the Punjab region can enjoy a state like Sher e Punjab,” Giani Harpreet Singh emphasised.“Sikhism could not be defined by the idea of Khalistan alone, Sikhism is the global idea and this idea should bring peace to the world,” he added.At a press conference on June 06, to mark the 36th anniversary of Army operation to flush out terrorists from the Golden Temple premises, Giani Harpreet Singh had allegedly made separatist remarks.However, a week later, he cited scriptures in Sikhism to support democratic set-up.“According to the concept given by Gurbani, Begumpura or Halemi Raj is the birthright of Sikh community and at a different time Sikh leaders living in democratic structures have made many statements about its achievements and framework and many seminars and there have been talked about,” he said in a statement.According to Gurmat ideology, the concept of Halemi Raj or Begumpura fully expresses the Sikh sentiments and the Indian constitution also gives every Sikh the right to carry out this struggle peacefully at the political level within a democratic structure.“Sikhs always wanted to be treated equally and justify as they also want to treat others the same way Sikhs have shown this during the regime of Maharaja Ranjit Singh,” Giani added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/akal-takht-chief-says-his-khalistan-remarks-misinterpreted-to-incite-sikhs-through-social-media/story-JQp1C3MgiUwkcQqyh9e6XN.html

Reeling under losses, shopkeepers rued that business was slowly moving back on track, but the decision to impose a lockdown on weekends has hit the businesses badly. The main markets of the city, including Chaura Bazar, Akalgarh Market, Sarabha Nagar market, Jawahar Nagar Camp among others, which usually remain jam-packed on Sundays, wore a deserted look. With markets closed and a fear gripping minds of residents amid rising Covid-19 cases in the city, very few vehicles were seen on city roads, even when the movement of residents has been allowed between 5am to 9pm.President of the Ludhiana Consumer Product Distributors Association Harkesh Mittal said, “After the government announced lockdown on weekends, most of the store owners, including those of essential commodities, chose to keep their shops shut as there is no customer in the market. The business has been badly affected due to perpetual lockdown and fear has gripped minds of residents as Covid-19 cases are rising.” Seeking a review of the orders, market associations in old city areas are also contemplating an agitation against the state government. President, Akalgarh Market Garment Association, Manpreet Singh Bunty, said, “The business is already going through a slump and we expect a good response during weekends as customers from other districts also visit markets. The government has further added to the woes of traders by announcing the lockdown on weekends. Our association and the shopkeepers near the Clock Tower are contemplating to launch an agitation if the decision is not reviewed in the coming days.” Meanwhile, a section of the shopkeepers felt that lockdown was necessary, but the government can provide some relief to the shopkeepers during weekdays. President of the Model Town Market Association Amarjit Singh said, “We understand the government had to announce the lockdown due to rising cases of Covid-19. But, the government should at least extend shops timings till 9pm. The shopkeepers have been directed to close the shops at 7pm. But, most of the customers move out of their houses only after 7pm due to scorching heat during the day.”RESTAURANTS GET LOW RESPONSELiquor vends and restaurants were open, but the establishments received a low response till afternoon.President of the Hotel and Restaurant Association Amarvir Singh said, “The hotels and restaurants were open on Sunday for home delivery and takeaways. But, low response was witnessed till afternoon.

The budget allocation for each of these health parameters can also be defined better and bring out the desired results in curtailing the spread of the Covid disease.”Ghosh has crunched the numbers from the 2011 census and points out that as per the data, in Pune district, 15.86 lakh residents are above the age of 50 and 8.56 lakh are 60-years-old and above.“This is the high-risk category for contracting Covid-19, due to age,” Ghosh says, adding, “census data can effectively help the state focus on other vulnerable groups as well; like the disabled, elderly persons with physical and intellectual disabilities and transgenders.”The data analysed further shows that 9.08 per cent of the elderly population in the district is aged 60 and above, while 16.82 per cent of the population is aged 50 and above. Census data enumerated by Ghosh further states that 25.24 of the disabled population in the district is 50- years-old and above, and 15.21 per cent are 60-years –old and above. Pune District Collector Naval Kishore Ram said, “Our basic target is to reach the old people who are vulnerable and have comorbid conditions. Our mission is to reduce the death rate and this data is becoming a part of our strategy to tackle the crisis. This data and the mathematical model of the census figure will help us fight Covid-19.”BJ Kerkar (86), general secretary, Insurance Pensional Association (Life and General), said, “Majority of the Covid-19 deaths which are being reported happen to be among the elderly. The population percentage which is available as per the 2011 census must be checked by the state and effective implementation of strategy can significantly reduce the spread of the contagion. The most vulnerable sections like senior citizens, physically challenged and the poor, must be the focus of the government. ” Number crunching PCMC data into an effective strategySpecifically in the PCMC, Ghosh works as a consultant to help the civic body understand the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as high risk factors for the Covid-19 mortality rate.Sample data is collected from the records of PCMC dispensaries and hospitals.“This research, as well as data sourced from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the National Family Health Service (NFHS), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and papers presented by expert committees at the international epidemiological conference at the United Nations, is extrapolated onto the PCMC population as per the 2011 Census, with the decadal growth factor taken into consideration,” Ghosh says.Ghosh states that there are 1,191 persons with multiple disabilities aged 50-years and above in PCMC. Similarly, 547 persons aged 50 and above in PCMC have intellectual disabilities, which accounts for 8.73 per cent of the area’s elderly.The total population in PCMC aged 50 years and above in PCMC is 2.90 lakh.Regarding the PCMC data, Ghosh said, “We see that the Covid response plan should be prepared in a targeted manner for a minimum of 76,392 and a maximum of 5,65,500 of population in the PCMC area. Further, it may be noted that the additional most vulnerable sections are persons with severe disability who come with co-morbid conditions such as reduced lung function or heart conditions, or both. Similarly, the transgender population, who are approximately 650 in number in the PCMC area, also have a reduced immunity level since a large number of them are HIV positive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/social-policy-expert-crunches-2011-census-data-to-re-focus-pune-district-strategy-to-protect-vulnerable/story-fPp8gv2KzxvwNCcpHytMGN.html

They shall be free from all political tinge...,” the circular said.Claiming that no recent development has prompted the institute to come up with the circular, Singh said, “It has been issued to apprise the new recruits about the service rules.” An IIT Kharagpur source said, a circular like this is issued from time to time.“However, with the proliferation of social media in recent years, it is important to make those having joined later to know about their responsibilities. “If they refer to their association with the organisation in their Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts, their comments and posts may be considered to be part of their official identity by followers on net, including media.“There is no monitoring as such but the authorities expect them to use their own discretion while posting in social media,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/iit-kharagpur-asks-faculty-not-to-write-on-topics-critical-of-government/story-G9CxcmHSLSyhr31BSlly6J.html

Educational experts say that many students belong to underprivileged sections and are struggling to attend online classes due to the lack of devices and high-speed Internet and will be unable to appear for their exams as well.“Not every parent has a smartphone. Besides, students, teachers in Kashmir struggle with 2G connectivity. This online assessment is an all conceived idea and is a totally futile exercise. The officials just want to claim the success that they conducted the exams,” said Abdul Qayoom, a vegetable farmer and parent of a Class 8 student. J&K’s State Institute of Education (SIE) issued a notification on June 12 stating that it has decided to conduct an online assessment of Class 8 students from June 15 after it opted for various remote learning options online teaching, access to e-learning materials, distribution of assignment-cum-tutorials and teaching through radio and TV.“In order to assess the initiatives taken by the department and to improve the teaching-learning process, the department has decided to conduct an online assessment to test the effectiveness of these initiatives,” said the notification by Joint Director, SIE, Kashmir.The tests will be of 45-minute with two subjects (15 points for each subject) combined on each day.Many parents were aghast over the department’s decision. “Not only government schools but even there are many parents of students studying in private schools who are not tech-savvy. How does the administration expect the students to appear in the exams without any prior knowledge of the process,” said Jan Mohammad, parent of two school-going children. There are over 10,800 government schools across the Kashmir valley.Advisor to the lieutenant governor, K.K Sharma who holds the school education charge said that he was not aware of the order and directed his staff to look into the issue. Director school education Younis Malik said that the students need not panic as the test was for assessment purpose only.“We just wanted to see the feedback. There are around 42,000 students studying in Class 8, of which 33,000 have contacted us for the assessment which sort of encouraged us. We are mulling to use this for assessment only, not for any grading purposes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-school-dept-to-hold-online-assessment-of-class-8-students-parents-resent/story-RF3AdNd9CQC2DttFwzHUnJ.html

14-06-2020||Delhi||Phone calls, chit-chat: How a Covid facility in Delhi is helping patients fight corona, isolation||For a person infected with Covid-19, the debilitating disease also brings with it an unbearable feeling of isolation. A Delhi hospital is helping its coronavirus patients in not only fighting the disease but also the accompanying loneliness with phone calls and a bit of chit-chat.At the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (RGSSH) here, doctors and nurses regularly interact with patients, making sure “they don’t lost touch with life” in the time of social distancing and quarantined existence.“We call this project ‘reaching out to the unreached’ and it started about one-and-a-half months ago. The idea was to help the patients deal with isolation while under treatment and also get feedback from them to improve our patient care system,” Director, RGSSH, Dr B L Sherwal told PTI on Sunday.RGSSH in east Delhi, with 500 beds, has been treating pandemic-affected patients since the outbreak in Delhi in March and has been a Covid-19 dedicated facility from the very beginning. The facility only admits serious coronavirus patients.“As part of this initiative, a team of doctors and nurses regularly calls patients in isolation wards to check on them and enquire about their general well-being. I also talk to many of them, by going in the wards or ICU, or on phone, and they also share their stories with us,” Sherwal said.The senior doctor says a phone call may appear to be very innocuous, but in many cases patients lose hope not because of the disease that has weakened their bodies but the terrible sense of loneliness that comes with staying in isolation.“Once I spoke to an old man and he told us he had no one to go to in Delhi, and requested that we allow him to stay a bit longer after treatment. We managed an arrangement for him in the non-Covid area for some time to help him. Loneliness also kills, you see,” Sherwal said, recalling his interaction with patients.The doctor in charge of the hospital’s grievance redressal system calls patients to ask about their well-being and to hear out their complains.“She gives me a list of the people she has called in a day and the complaints received, maybe on medicine not given on time, or about food or anything else, and that helps us improve our patient care system at RGSSH,” the director said.Asked what motivated them to come up with the system, Sherwal said the genesis of this was the social media posts being made during the Tablighi Jamaat episode, when a large number of its members were brought to the facility from the Nizamuddin area where a religious congregation had taken place.“A normal person behaves in a different manner during isolation, and that’s what we understood. Many social media videos had been put up during that time showing the wards. We took it up in two ways, as an impulse to go for course correction if any gaps are found in our system, and also to counter the allegations made in the videos,” he said.So the improvement of patient care system began and soon the facility will discharge its 1000th patient after successful recovery from Covid-19, Sherwal added.A 65-year-old American woman who was diagnosed with Covid-19 was discharged from RGSSH three days ago after successfully recovering from coronavirus infection.“Thank you everyone from the bottom of my heart and everyone at Rajiv Gandhi hospital for the amazing service. Your expertise and techniques saved my life. Thank you all of you for your generosity,” she said.Sherwal said while many foreign nationals were brought to RGSSH after the Tablighi congregation, this woman was the first American national to be treated at the hospital.Delhi recorded 2,134 fresh coronavirus cases on Saturday, the second highest single-day spike here taking the Covid-19 tally in the city to cross the 38,000-mark, and the death toll due to the disease climbed to 1,271, authorities said.As many as 14,945 patients have recovered, been discharged or migrated so far, while there are 22,742 active cases, according to the Delhi health department.Sherwal said besides face-to-face and telephonic conversations with patients, the hospital has also formed a ‘May I Help You’ team.“The uniforms of doctors and nurses who are part of this team carry the logo of ‘May I Help You’ on both sides, so patients can recognise them from a distance and tell them their problems,” he said.“A patient-doctor relationship is very different. Though in the initial days doctors and nurses were scared to go near patients, now they are all helping them recover,” Sherwal said.Perhaps because unprecedented times call for unprecedented measures, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/phone-calls-chit-chat-how-a-covid-facility-in-delhi-is-helping-patients-fight-corona-isolation/story-RfO9NzBNhb4PMmjbkSYCnM.html
14-06-2020||Kolkata||Kolkata restaurants’ businesses hit due to liquor sale ban in eateries||The continuing ban on sales of liquor in restaurants in the wake of the lockdown has hit revenues of many plush eateries in the city, restaurateurs said on Sunday.Besides, the night curfew starting from 9 pm has impacted their turnover adversely, they said.The Hotels and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) secretary Sudesh Poddar said, “Most of the eateries are running at a loss due to the ban on liquor sales at the moment.” It will be difficult for restaurateurs to pay salary to their staff and meet air conditioning expenses, while hygiene costs have increased manifold due to the coronavirus outbreak.Nitin Kothari, who owns the famous Peter Cat and Mocambo restaurants in Park Street area, also said the businesses of most eateries here are being “affected due to the restriction on liquor sales”.According to him, liquor sales account for 70-75 per cent of revenue for most restaurants in the eastern metropolis.“Our business has been hit, but not to the extent which others have witnessed. People come to our restaurants to enjoy good food which constitutes roughly 80 per cent of the revenue,” he said.However, the West Bengal government has already allowed sales of liquor from standalone shops.Diners are not keen to visit eateries in the evening due to the nigh curfew starting from 9 pm, Kothari said, adding that sales have mostly been hit as only 50 per cent of the tables are allowed for seating as per the government order.“Hopefully, the government will relax these restrictions. Else, many restaurants may have to down their shutters,” he said.The association has already written to the state government, seeking relaxations in these aspects, Poddar said.Footfalls have not been satisfactory due to the ban on liquor sales, according to a manager of Red Kitchen and Lounge, a restaurant-cum-bar in Dum Dum area.The timing of the night curfew is also causing inconvenience to the diners, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-restaurants-businesses-hit-due-to-liquor-sale-ban-in-eateries/story-R59kAjJtu8bLfnOAHpNHFK.html
14-06-2020||Pune||Landslide threat: PMC slaps notice to Padmaja Park 2 to vacate in 24 hrs; residents plan to move court||Close to 300 residents of Padmaja Park 2, an upscale housing society in Bibvewadi’s Lake Town area, woke up on Friday to a Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) notice asking them to vacate the premises within 24 hours. PMC said the building – constructed in 2010 next to a small hill – is under threat due to possible landslides during the monsoon.The society, on the other hand, has alleged that it was PMC’s “faulty and irresponsible” work while constructing a sports complex and a swimming pool on the hill that disturbed the soil position, leading to possible landslides (there was one on June 3 this year), and thus threatening the building’s fencing wall and putting residents’ lives in danger. The PMC sports complex came up in 2017.The notice, issued by PMC’s building development department, states: “The land portion of the PMC-run sports complex has dislocated, wherein it has emerged as a threat to the society fencing wall and the society at large. In view of the monsoon, and to avoid impending danger, all residents are directed to vacate the premises within 24 hours.” The notice adds that in the case of non-compliance, under powers granted by the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act 268(7)(B), the department will be forced to vacate the residents with police assistance. “Any loss to human life and property vests with the society completely,” the notice says.Deepak Firodiya, secretary, Padmaja Park 2, said the construction of the sports complex in 2017 and the subsequent use of heavy machinery, resulted in the loosening of the hillock’s soil structure. “In the past, boulders came hurtling down, and have posed a danger to our lives,” Firodiya said. “The PMC must take quick steps to address its irresponsibility and should not put the onus on us. They must withdraw the notice.”HT reached out to PMC Commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad on Saturday for his comments on this story. However, phone calls and text messages went unanswered.According to the society chairperson Dilip Naukudkar, residents have refused to vacate the premises and will legally challenge PMC notice. “The notice is in violation of the Epidemic Diseases Act,” he said. “The PMC has acted illegally and we will sue them. There is a restriction on people’s movement during the Covid crisis. Where are we supposed to go in this situation? PMC will have to withdraw the notice as it against the law.”Lawyer Rohan Nahar said, “The society can go to court and obtain a stay on the notice. Why should people vacate; it is their place of residence. The society must take technical advice and seek fair compensation from the PMC for its act. They must immediately move the court against the notice. What is the need for a 24-hour notice? Under what law? This is against human rights, and on the face of it, the notice is illegal.”Pournima Borade, a resident, said, “How can PMC send a vacation notice when there are dialysis patients and other senior citizens living here. This notice is aimed at endangering our lives in the Covid crisis.” Another resident Tanuja Joshi said, “There is no basis in law for the notice. Where will we go during the Covid crisis? PMC has made no arrangement for alternative accommodation. There is no application of mind behind this notice.”Virendra Kelkar, deputy engineer, building permissions department, had visited the society for inspection. He said, “We have called a meeting with the residents and other stakeholders on Monday. We expect a solution after that.”Area corporator Vasant More blamed the PMC, saying the swimming pool construction may have disturbed the soil. “The society says that when they constructed the fencing wall, there was no sports complex on the hillock. PMC constructed the swimming pool later, and this disturbed the soil position, leading to landslides. Both the society and the PMC have their viewpoints. I will ensure that a concrete solution is arrived at in the larger interest of the society residents,” said More.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/landslide-threat-pmc-slaps-notice-to-padmaja-park-2-to-vacate-in-24-hrs-residents-plan-to-move-court/story-xRr3VarsU1Cnwmyd1B7l7J.html
14-06-2020||Pune||City’s small eateries, cafes stare at uncertain future||At least 90 food establishments have shut down in the city over the last one month due to financial crisis and labour shortage during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the Pune Restaurant and Hoteliers Association. Ganesh Shetty, president of the Pune Restaurant and Hoteliers Association says that 40 per cent of the 200 small eateries across the city have been badly affected due to the lockdown. “The major reason is the high rent which adds to their already pressed pockets and with no clarity on when restaurants and pubs can open, the employees, who are currently in their hometowns, do not want to return,” said Shetty.According to the owners of the small eateries in the city, with 100 per cent dependency on labour and no financial support from the government during these testing times, they are facing losses and are struggling to survive. “We started business in December 2019, but over the past few months, we have been struggling to operate,” said Saili Jahagirdar Mirikar, owner of Zillionth Bistro. The small eatery in Kothrud has been offering only home delivery since March, but Mirikar, is now not sure how long the business will survive. “It is not just restaurants and delivery agencies, but small and big businesses like raw material supplies, social media agencies, advertising agencies, restaurant software providers, among others who have also massively suffered. No one is even talking about these markets and it is estimated that by the time the food industry is functional again, it is likely to wipe out at least 40 per cent of its own kin. There are at least 500 food establishments in the city currently,” said Shetty.Dinesh Maheshwari had a flourishing business at a small cafe on the Baner Pashan link road for five years, but since March, Dinesh has been at home as even he has no staff to prepare food even for home delivery.“I owned a restaurant called Chutney Sauce Murraba and then, ventured into home delivery for a year. But now, I am unsure of how things will work out. In April, everybody was under the impression that things will become normal and following the government’s rules, the landlords did not charge rent. However, now the landlord has asked us to pay in instalments,” said Dinesh. Dinesh’s employees went home when the lockdown was first announced in March. “My kitchen has been closed since March 21. We did not get enough home delivery orders to cover the cost, the input cost of meats, vegetables are going up, and members of the staff who are still here, want to return home,” added the former chartered accountant who joined the food business because of his passion for cooking.The next two months are crucial for the restaurants, feel most of the owners. “If the restaurants and cafes open, their business will depend on the number of people visiting them and the staff who can return to work. I think only those restaurants/cafes with strong financial backing can survive as even the aggregators have stopped putting their money in the market,” Shetty added.Shetty says that the only scope for the standalone eateries currently is home delivery and the hope that customers will walk into the restaurant after they are open. “Most of the owners are unsure about getting their business on track after the situation normalises. If landlords can look at profit-sharing when the eateries open, then, it can help sustain the business, but otherwise, there is nothing optimistic about this business,” said Shetty, though he added that home delivery should help sustain the restaurant and keep it afloat.Harsh Wagh, a food consultant, had helped start nine restaurants in the city and now, three have shut their business. “Currently, a lot of eateries/ cafes are on sale or shutting down as they have not been able to sustain the financial crisis and the future doesn’t look too promising. But that doesn’t mean that the restaurant business will stop completely. No one can live without food and chain restaurants with solid backing will continue to stay afloat,” said Wagh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/city-s-small-eateries-cafes-stare-at-uncertain-future/story-XE3LyLlr9ujgMAqWv4u9uO.html

14-06-2020||Pune||519 Covid-19 positive cases identified via PMC’s house-to-house survey||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) which has resurveyed 50 per cent of the city’s population through house-to-house survey has detected 519 Covid-19 (coronavirus) positive cases till June 13.The survey which was initiated on March 16 has also helped the civic body detect as many as 4,119 people who had flu-like symptoms. Unlike the previous house-to-house survey, in addition to thermal scanning residents are also checked for oxygen saturation in the second round.Dr Ramchandra Hankare, PMC health chief, said, “We have started using pulse oxymeters in the second round along with thermal scanning. We will also start random testing of blood pressure and sugar levels soon as our paramedical staff is being trained for the same.”“This survey is a continuous process and will go on for some time now,” he added.A ward medical officer said, “We are checking for oxygen saturation and temperature of everyone in containment zones, of high-risk contacts and of those who have comorbidity. In non-containment zones, only those who have any flu-like symptoms are checked for oxygen saturation while others are asked various general questions.”As many as 656 survey teams are present on the ground who have been given pulse oxymeters and thermal guns. Based on their body temperature and oxygen saturation, they are referred for further swab collection.PMC teachers oppose assignment related to Covid-19 survey As the Anganwadi sevikas are yet to undergo training to test sugar levels and blood pressure, the PMC is trying to get its civic teachers to do the basic survey of thermal scanning and pulse oxymeters which can be performed after basic training. However, teachers are resisting to do so fearing infection and only a few teachers are on the ground who are willing to do the job. Dr Hankare said, “We do have some resistance from civic teachers, but the survey is safe as the thermal scanning can be done at a distance and we do provide safety equipment like masks and gloves to check pulse oximeter too.”“Currently, this is being done by the nurses hired by us on a contract basis. We have brought up this issue with the PMC commissioner, who assured that once the Anganwadi sevikas returned from their training, the teachers would be relieved from the job,” said Dr Hankare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/519-covid-19-positive-cases-identified-via-pmc-s-house-to-house-survey/story-fcF58rQxhoWiutL0RRFdjN.html
14-06-2020||Kolkata||Long-distance bus operators to run vehicles on Kolkata routes||With several Kolkata-based private bus operators demanding an increase in fares to resume services, the West Bengal transport department has roped in long-distance private bus operators to run their fleets in the city to meet the demand in the eastern metropolis, officials said on Sunday.Though some local private bus operators have recommenced services in Kolkata since last week, the number of vehicles on the roads is less than normal, causing trouble to commuters, they said.The long-distance bus operators, on the other hand, have been sitting idle since the imposition of the lockdown and have not yet restarted their services on intra-state routes due to less demand despite the easing of restrictions.They have agreed to ply air-conditioned buses on several routes in Kolkata from Monday onwards and charge fares fixed by the state transport authority, the officials said.The long-distance bus operators have hailed it as a ‘win-win’ situation for both the state transport department and them.“Most of our buses were sitting idle as employees in IT hub Sector V are working from home but on the other hand, office-goers and common people in other places are facing a harrowing time in getting buses to reach their destinations,” Souvik Biswas of Hexa Ride, a mobile application-based bus service between Kolkata and its neighbouring districts, said.His firm will run 30 buses on the Garia-Barasat and Garia-Howrah station routes.Dhananjay Singh of Kaushik Global Logistics said the company has got permission from the transport department to run 20 buses between Barasat and Dalhousie. He said the firm will decide on running more buses depending on the demand.“We run these buses on Kolkata-Siliguri, Kolkata- Asansol and other long-distance routes. But since there is very little demand despite easing of the lockdown, we have not recommenced our services,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/long-distance-bus-operators-to-run-vehicles-on-kolkata-routes/story-13vqSijTwpB7yuCMKxBP8H.html
14-06-2020||Pune||PMC projects 40,906 Covid-19 positive cases by July-end, shortage of 282 ICU beds and 172 ventilators||A new official projection indicates that Pune will record at least 40,906 progressive Covid-19 cases and 18,408 active cases by July 31. The estimate, published by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) Smart City Covid-19 war room, is calculated based on the current positive and active cases, and the city’s doubling rate of 19 days. The projection also highlights that PMC will likely witness a shortage of 282 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 172 ventilators by July 31 for critically-ill Covid-19 patients. The projection also includes 80 per cent regulated bed capacity, but it says there will be no shortage of beds with or without oxygen facility.At present, the civic body has 30 Covid care centres, 11 dedicated Covid health centres and 25 dedicated Covid hospitals. These 66 medical facilities have a total of 15,500 beds, of which 2,500 have artificial oxygen supply equipment, in addition to 580 ICU beds and 288 ventilators.Pune’s average daily growth rate for Covid-19 cases is 3.16% as per PMC’s Smart City war room data analysis for the period from May 28 to June 8. According to local health officials, the availability of ICU beds and ventilators is essential in providing critical care to severely infected patients. On June 12, Pune had 9,082 progressive total cases with 2,733 active cases. According to PMC data, there are 49 critical patients on ventilators, while 173 are being treated in the ICU.Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra chapter, said, “The current situation is a manifestation of years of ignoring health infrastructure. When I graduated in 1982, there was one government hospital (Sassoon General Hospital) in the city. This is still the same. If this continues, we fear that the government will force us to buy ventilators and critical-care infrastructure. The government either needs to buy it themselves or request from other countries or states.” ​A senior civic officer who attended a review meeting with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday, said, “Deputy CM Ajit Pawar has said that the central government will soon dispatch some ventilators, and most of it would be reserved for Pune’s Sassoon hospital. This will be of great help.”​ The officer spoke to HT on condition of anonymity. “We will also try and increase our testing capacity, so that the results are available in 24 hours and a positive patient can be isolated immediately,” he added.Shekhar Gaikwad, PMC commissioner, said, “We will issue orders to every private hospital from Monday to ensure that regulated prices are being strictly implemented and that there is no shortage of hospital beds.”​He added, “Our current focus is on detecting patients with comorbidities, pregnant women and senior citizens to help us in early detection and isolation. Early treatment means early recovery. Our aim is to ensure that patients does not reach a stage where they require ventilators or ICU beds.”In addition, until June 13, 29 private hospitals have implemented the state government resolution dated May 21 to cap the price on 80 per cent of their beds ranging from Rs 4,000 to Rs 9,000 per day.

With the slowing of the doubling rate, Pune’s R-naught (RO), which in April was above four, has also come down to 0.9, according to the civic body data. RO indicates how contagious the infectious disease is. The RO at 0.9 now means that one person is likely to infect one person and for every new case of Covid-19 reported, one person is declared cured and is discharged.The relative fall in the spread of the virus in the city comes when Pune is inching closer to the 10,000 mark of Covid-19 positive cases.According to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) as of Saturday, the city’s progressive positive cases of Covid-19 stood at 9,336 with 254 cases reported within 24 hours on Saturday.A senior health official from the district health office, said, “If the R- naught is around four or five it means that there is a serious issue which needs to be taken care of while the doubling rate has to be more than before. R-naught and doubling rate are inversely proportional. There are many factors which help make policy decisions includes these two numbers.”Shekhar Gaikwad, PMC commissioner, said, “Doubling rate is broad-based since it is about the progressive number of cases which will keep on increasing, however, the R-naught is more important since it denotes that the current status has come below one, which is a good sign for the city.”“We are preparing for the worst and so the number of cases we estimated earlier is not the same now. We will work on extending the doubling rate further and decreasing the R-naught,” said Gaikwad.R-naught, which is calculated by the state health department, helps make policy decisions like the number of minimum contacts to be traced for each case, easing restrictions in any area and emphases on social distancing. R-naught figure can also be calculated at a local level to determine the lockdown restrictions and strict implementation of lockdown.The doubling rate helps project the number of cases to be expected in the future if the reported cases continue to remain steady and also the health infrastructure readiness of the civic body and other government authorities. The doubling rate of the city has been improving consistently. The number of cases on May 7 May was 2,146 which doubled to 4,107 cases as of May 21, while from May 22 May to June 9 the number of cases rose from 4,107 to 8,205 taking the doubling rate to 19 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-moves-closer-to-10k-mark-but-city-s-doubling-rate-and-r-naught-improves/story-b6FZ814zFuK4VHJCFOuSRL.html

14-06-2020||Kolkata||Covid-19: Developers in Bengal get more time to complete housing projects||Developers in the state were given additional nine months for completing projects by the West Bengal Housing Industry Regulatory Authority (WBHIRA), in a major relief for the sector reeling under the impact of the Covid-19 crisis, officials said on Sunday.Following the decision, developers would not have to pay any penalty or face action if a project is delayed by up to nine months from the scheduled time, they said.It will give a boost to the sector that has been severely hit by the Covid-19 crisis and the lockdown that has led to the stoppage of construction work for over two months, officials said.The industry assured that construction activities would begin soon and said that with the support of the government, there is room to absorb 5 lakh more workers into the sector with the huge number of migrant labourers returning to the state.Recognising the pandemic as a ‘force majeure’ condition, the WBHIRA allowed the additional time under Section 6 of the West Bengal Housing Industry Regulatory Act, 2017. The law allows extension of up to one year for such situations that are beyond control, officials said.CREDAI West Bengal, the apex real estate body in the state, said they had sought an extension for one year as the lockdown brought all construction work to a standstill.Housing Minister Chandrima Bhattacharya told PTI that the West Bengal government is putting in efforts to support all in the trying times and thus the extension was considered.The industry appreciates the positive approach of the West Bengal government, particularly WBHIRA for such pro- active steps. There are about 35 lakh workers in the construction sector in the state. Another estimated 5 lakh people are engaged in back office, sales and technical support and consultancy, CREDAI West Bengal president Sushil Mohta said.The industry has also written to municipal bodies, the Urban Development Department and other authorities for similar extension of approval period because of the delays happening due to the pandemic. But, so far positive response has come only from WBHIRA, he said.With the support of the state government the industry will be able to absorb additional 5 lakh workers, Mohta said.The real estate sector is about 10 per cent of West Bengal’s GDP, the body said, adding that it is one of the highest contributors to the state’s revenue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/covid-19-developers-in-bengal-get-more-time-to-complete-housing-projects/story-YKasgCxTLKrnHQ8b5Z5P7N.html

They will be informed if there is scope,” he added. To a question on Vishwanath and Nagaraj, Narayan said, “To tell you the truth, it is not a matter of assurance.Promise has been made only to Shankar whereas the others have requested that they be ‘rehabilitated somewhere’ since they have lost the election and opportunity be given to them.” Shankar was not offered a ticket to contest the bypoll with an assurance by Yediyurappa that he would be made an MLC.Meanwhile, Vishwanath responded by reminding the Deputy Chief Minister that the BJP came to power because of the sacrifice of rebel MLAs of Congress and the JD(S). “Because of our sacrifice he became DCM. He should have explained with whose sacrifice he came to power,” Vishwanath told P T I.The election is scheduled to take place on June 29 for which the notification has been issued and the last date of filing nomination is June 18.Of the seven seats, BJP is set to win four, Congress two seats and the JD(S) one seat given the number of MLAs in the assembly, who elect the MLCs.The ruling BJP has 116 members excluding Speaker, Congress has 68 and the JD(S) has 34 members in the assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/shankar-to-get-mlc-ticket-leadership-to-decide-about-others-karnataka-deputy-cm/story-9QwdTU0xrN9UcfE4gJ6hoN.html

14-06-2020||Mumbai||How Mumbai’s Dharavi chased Covid-19 has lessons for other developing nations||Mumbai’s Dharavi, Asia’s most crowded slum, has gone from coronavirus hotspot to potential success story, offering a model for developing nations struggling to contain the pandemic.Authorities have knocked on 47,500 doors since April to measure temperatures and oxygen levels, screened almost 700,000 people in the slum cluster and set up fever clinics. Those showing symptoms were shifted to nearby schools and sports clubs converted into quarantine centers. Fresh daily infections are now down to a third compared with early May, more than half the sick are recovering, and the number of deaths plummeted this month in the tenement where as many as eighty residents share a toilet.The numbers are in stark contrast to the rest of India, whose daily tally of new infected cases has quadrupled since early May. Located near Mumbai’s financial district, Dharavi’s dogged approach to “chase the virus” could be a template for emerging markets across the world, from the favelas of Brazil to shanty towns in South Africa.“It was next to impossible to follow social distancing,” said Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner at Mumbai’s municipality, who is in charge of leading the fight in Dharavi. “The only option then was to chase the virus rather than wait for the cases to come. To work proactively, rather than reactively.”Officials were initially worried as positive diagnoses rose, but it meant people didn’t have to wait to get sick. Dighavkar and his team made it clear that screenings and testing would continue even as the count increased -- their objective was to keep deaths limited.“We were able to isolate people at early stages,” Dighavkar said. “Unlike in the rest of Mumbai, where most patients are reaching hospitals at a very late stage.”The strategy has helped reduce mortality and improve recovery. About 51% of Dharavi residents who test positive eventually recovered, better than Mumbai’s 41% rate. Fresh infections are down to an average 20 a day from 60 in early May. India, meanwhile, added more than 11,000 cases on June 13.A strict lockdown and accessible testing was part of Dharavi’s strategy. If someone was not feeling well and wanted to get tested, just get institutionally quarantined and on-site doctors will take care of it.However, Dighavkar knew none of this would be possible without gaining the community’s trust. Home to nearly a million people where a family of seven may be living in a 100-square feet hutment, word travels fast in Dharavi and small gestures help.For instance, Ramadan -- the Muslim holy month -- was crucial. Those in isolation centers were concerned about how they’d keep up with rituals, such as breaking their religious fasts at sunset. Authorities ensured they got fruits and dates and distributed proper meals at appropriate times while all others received three meals a day.Free ServicesEveryone in the isolation centers also received round-the-clock medical supervision free of cost, even as millions around the country lost their jobs due to the nationwide lockdown and reports trickled in of people dying before they were allotted hospital beds.Once word got around, people would volunteer themselves to be quarantined as soon as symptoms appeared, according to Dighavkar.There should never be any pressure on keeping the number of cases low, he said, adding that the focus instead needed to be on screening and timely treatment because the ultimate aim was to save lives.Yet, Dharavi’s war against the virus is far from over. Once shelter-at-home restrictions are fully lifted in Mumbai and the bustling city goes back to work, there’s a risk of a second wave of infections.“The battle can’t be over until the virus has gone from the entire city, state and country,” said Dighavkar. “People are quite aware now of how to be safe and I think by the time the lockdown ends, most of us may have got herd immunity. Or so we hope.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/how-mumbai-s-dharavi-chased-covid-19-has-lessons-for-other-developing-nations/story-HaSFaGRzFNcnXCOboFT3cK.html

14-06-2020||Delhi||Almost 1 in 3 tested people Covid-19 positive in Delhi this week||Almost one in three persons tested for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi this week had the infection, according to government data. The average positivity rate – the percentage of people who test positive – in Delhi during the week was 30.5% , a number that is perhaps as indicative of the inherent bias in testing (which has only become more marked, especially in Delhi) as it is of the spread of the pandemic in the capital.The national average positivity rate is around 7%, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Delhi’s positivity rate has been rising rapidly, from an average of 23% in the week ending on June 7, and, before that, an average of 14% the previous week. .According to government data, 4,900 samples were tested each day on average during this week, down from 5,590 tests a day on average during the week ending June 7, and 6,129 tests a day on average in the week before that.On Saturday, Delhi recorded 2,134 cases and 57 deaths, the daily bulletin released by the Delhi government showed.“This just means that currently the numbers are on a rising trend and there is transmission happening in the community. There is no other way the city could record so many cases a day. However, the increasing positivity rate could also be a result of labs testing only those with symptoms. If you test only the people who are likely to have the infection, the positivity rate will of course be high,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at AIIMS, New Delhi.The Delhi government on June 2 put in place a restrictive testing strategy that excluded asymptomatic contacts of positive cases if they weren’t old or did not have comorbid conditions such as diabetes or hypertension.Dr Broor recommends lowering the bar for testing to include high-risk asymptomatic people.“One, we need to do community-level antibody testing in Delhi to understand the burden of the disease. But, when it comes to resource-intensive RT-PCR test, we cannot test every asymptomatic person. However, those at a higher risk such as health care workers, front line workers like paramedical staff and the police, someone who has come in contact with another positive case, or anyone with comorbidities should be allowed to get tested,” said Dr Broor.Testing norms should be eased, agreed Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine in Delhi’sSafdarjung Hospital. “ Now that the infection is in the community, the government should relax the testing norms and allow people easy access to it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/almost-1-in-3-tested-people-covid-19-positive-in-delhi-this-week/story-3YxZVqud10x44qUD2F41CM.html

After entering the office, he put the bag on the floor and posed as he is taking out something from the bag.Meanwhile, his three accomplices barged into the office and flashed weapons and threatened the employees and tied them to chairs.The four miscreants have been captured in the CCTVs installed in the area.On November 8, 2019, the robbers had also robbed Rs 7 lakh from the office of a steel and rolling mill on the Gill Road.The robbers had also attempted a robbery at the office of AH Alloys on the same day, but the employees had not opened the door following which the robbers had fled.The ADCP added it could be the handiwork of the same gang, but the police want to investigate the case thoroughly before jumping to any conclusion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rs-7lakh-burglary-in-ludhiana-number-plate-of-robbers-motorcycle-found-fake/story-pkdYBu7vmOtnQFssnsSBFK.html
14-06-2020||Chandigarh||Rohtak cousins among 39 Haryana cadets commissioned as officers||Two cousins — Aakash Rana, 26, and Abhijeet, 25 — from Rohtak’s Pakasma village are among 39 Haryana cadets who passed out from the Indian Military Academy (IMA) in Dehradun on Saturday. Aakash’s father Narender Rana, an employee of Haryana tourism department, said his son had pursued post-graduation in civil engineering from Rohtak, while his nephew did his BTech from Faridabad. Aakash had joined the IMA through technical graduate course (TGC), while Abhijeet took the combined defence services (CDS) exam. “We have a joint family and the boys studied together till Class 12. They again got back together at the IMA, but will now have to part their ways. Aakash will be sent to the engineering unit in Amritsar and Abhijeet will move to Uttar Pradesh’s Babina in the armoured regiment,” he added. Expressing his disappointment over not being able to witness the Passing Out Parade, Aakash’s father said, “The academy won’t even send them back home this time. My family will have to wait to see them as officers.” A retired armyman and grandfather of the lieutenants, Randhir Rana, said he had instilled in them the dream of donning the olive green one day. “My grandsons proved that nothing is impossible if you are determined and have a fixed goal,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rohtak-cousins-among-39-haryana-cadets-commissioned-as-officers/story-hE5RnEXoEAq5U3noHVV9GK.html

14-06-2020||Mumbai||Misery brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic unimaginable, says Bombay HC in landmark ruling||In a landmark order, a division bench of Bombay high court (HC) on Friday said, “We need to remind ourselves that despite nearing 75 years of our independence, despite the guarantees that Part III of the Constitution envisions, and despite the goals engrafted in Part IV of the Constitution which the State ought to strive to achieve, a society which can provide equal opportunities to all is yet a distant reality.” The division bench comprised Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and justice Amjad Sayyad was hearing a clutch of petitions regarding the handling of the Covid-19 outbreak in Maharashtra.While listing failures on part of the state in its handling of the pandemic and the challenges faced by the poor and migrant workers during lockdown, the bench said, “That misery of this degree could be brought about by the pandemic was indeed unimaginable. The pandemic and the resultant lockdown have destabilised the Indian economy, while wrecking the ‘haves’ and the ‘have nots’ alike. It has shown how pitiable the conditions of migrant workers in India are. India, as things stand now, can hardly think of a fair and just society any time in the near future.”The bench pointed out “factors which have been responsible for the spread of the pandemic in India” including lack of preparedness to tackle a problem of such magnitude, insufficient testing kits as well as protective gear and generally inadequate healthcare infrastructure. It also noted that not sharing data led to limited awareness regarding Covid-19 among large sections of the population and criticised the coordination between the Centre and state.Further, the bench noted that it fell upon the judiciary to address citizens’ concerns when the legislative fails to do so. “A judiciary, zealous and vigilant in safeguarding the rights of the people, is what the framers of the Constitution dreamt of and it needs no reiteration that by and large, the people of this nation have reposed faith and trust in the judicial institutions to rescue them in even the worst of situations,” said the bench, going on to add that “judicial propriety demands that we tread the path of caution and circumspection” while criticising the role of the executive in the handling of the pandemic. “Instead of adoption of a critical approach of the unintended failures of the executive, the exercise of the extraordinary power available under Article 226 of the Constitution has to be tempered by judicial restraint,” it said.The bench then went on to quote parts of the famous “tryst with destiny” speech, delivered on the eve of India independence to the constituent assembly in 1947 by the first prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru. “The service of India means the service of the millions who suffer. It means the ending of poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity. The ambition of the greatest man of our generation has been to wipe every tear from every eye. That may be beyond us, but as long there are tears and suffering, so long our work will not be over,” Nehru had said.The bench went on to state, “If indeed tears and suffering are to be wiped from those who are ailing of Covid-19 and related matters, the nation expects service, ie ‘seva’, from each one of its citizens. It does not take much to serve.”Failure to provide testing facilities for frontline workers at hospitalsThe division bench extended a Nagpur bench’s order of June 1 and said that “if any frontline/ healthcare worker at non-Covid hospitals/wards expresses willingness for being tested on RT-PCR method, the respondents shall proceed in that direction in accordance with the guidelines and protocol prescribed therefor by the ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research].” The order came after senior advocate Mihir Desai, appearing for the non-governmental organisation Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, had contended that the state should extend the benefit of testing to asymptomatic workers. Desai said nearly 41,000 people, including doctor, nurses and other frontline workers, had contracted the virus and many policemen had also succumbed to Covid-19. He also pointed out a June 1 order of the Nagpur bench of the HC had said that even though the extant guidelines do not envisage testing of all frontline/healthcare workers, the state owes this to frontline workers to ensure minimisation of any risk to them.Appearing for the state, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni sasid testing of asymptomatic frontline workers working in hospitals and containment zones, as declared by the relevant authorities, has been left to the discretion of such frontline workers. There is no mandatory direction for testing of all asymptomatic frontline workers. Kumbhakoni contended that the aim should be to test those who actually need tests, but had urged the court to issue directions to fine-tune the system so that testing kits are not wasted but there is maximum utilization of the available kits through pragmatic decision making.Senior advocate Anil Sakhare, appearing for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said a rational approach has to be adopted since there’s a scarcity of materials. He said 3,500 to 4,000 tests are being conducted daily and said the court ought to leave the matter of deciding which frontline workers should be tested — symptomatic or asymptomatic — to BMC.Distribution of PPEResponding to a petition filed by Dayanand Stalin, the bench held that the neither the state nor BMC are under any obligation to “distribute PPE to all and sundry”. It found the plea that each healthcare worker treating non-Covid patients to be provided with PPEs justified to the extent of face masks and shields, gloves, goggles and sanitisation materials including soap, but not the full equipment which includes a body suit, covered shoes etc. “Use of a full body-suit could create significant hazards such as physical and psychological stress, impaired vision, mobility and communication. Literature on ,PPEs which we have had the occasion to look into, sounds a caution that greater the level of PPE protection, greater would be the associated risk,” the bench said.The bench said that distribution of PPEs must be need-based. “We hope and trust that the state and BMC shall be rational in distribution of PPEs, and leave no room for complaint in regard to its distribution and the other kits in keeping with the demands of the situation,” the bench noted.Price cap on pathological testsThe bench held that it would leave it to the state “to spread the net of free testing high and wide to cover maximum number of people in distress”. The order came after the state brought to the notice of the bench a circular dated May 21, by which charges for treatment at private or charitable hospitals and health service care centres were capped. The petition was filed by Kurla resident Sarika Singh, who learnt from a police constable that he was asked to deposit Rs 2 lakh by a private hospital when he sought treatment for Covid-19. Advocate Varsha Jagdale informed the court that the exorbitant demand of the hospital was brought down to Rs 20,000 after the police threatened to charge the hospital for denying treatment to a patient.Beds in private hospitals for economically weaker sectionsResponding to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by non-governmental organisation Jan Swasthya Abhiyan and Mumbai resident Mehrwan Fashed, the bench gave full liberty to Maharashtra state to take punitive action against hospitals that fail to comply with the state’s directive of reserving 80% of available beds in private or charitable hospitals for the Covid-19 patients. The PIL asked the court to direct that beds in private hospitals be reserved for patients from economically weaker sections of society and that the cost of treatment at these hospitals should be borne by the state. “Although 20% of the beds in the private/charitable hospitals are required to be reserved for the poorest and the poor, the situation arising out of the pandemic has compelled the State to take a proactive stand keeping in mind the need to reach out to all,” said the bench. Covid-19 helplinesTwo PILs filed by activist Dayanand Stalin through advocate Aniket Kulkarni and lawyer Mutahhar Khan through advocate Sharan Jagtiani alleged the BMC-run Covid-19 helpline (1916) was ineffective because callers had long waits and those responding to the calls were not able to offer much help. The bench noted there was “a divergence of opinion” as some have got assistance from the helpline. “Those who have been critical must realize the prevailing situation of the pandemic and that assistance of the level that could be expected or available in normal times may not now be on offer. That the MCGM [Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai] has to respond to more than 4,000 calls per day is an indicator of the load taken by the informers receiving the calls,” said the bench. While noting that there was scope for improvement, the bench directed the state to see to it that other municipal corporations set up helplines similar to 1916.War room dashboardMultiple petitions raised complaints that it was difficult to get accurate information for available Covid-19 facilities, like beds and ventilators. Following the suggestions of petitioners, MCGM has devised a ‘war room’ dashboard that uploads relevant information online. “We record our satisfaction at such dashboard providing relevant information regarding the current status of the effects of the pandemic in the state as well as the data forming part of it. The only direction that we wish to make in this behalf is to direct the MCGM to upload on its website the entirety of the contents of the dashboard placed before us so that such data could benefit those in search of the available facilities,” said the bench.Absence of grievance redressal cellA PIL by Sarika Singh and Mehrwan Farshed had pointed out there was no platform for grievances of those who could not get admitted or treated or were being charged excessively. “We are of the considered view that the MCGM should, without any delay, explore ways and means to set up a grievance redressal cell before which complaints could be lodged online/offline. The IAS officer who has been deputed to monitor and oversee the activities related to COVID-19, or any other officer, shall be appointed as the head of the cell with instructions to act promptly as and when complaints deserving immediate intervention are received,” said the bench.The Uber alternativePetitioners raised complaints regarding MCGM-run ambulances, which are insufficient now that the majority are transporting Covid-19 patients, and suggested roping in taxi aggregator apps like Uber to transport non-Covid patients to hospitals. MCGM has been using ambulances offered by NGOs as well as converting buses run by the Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking into ambulances. “The State and MCGM may consider requiring private ambulances to be made operational, provided of course requisite human resources are available to operate it. If indeed the platform of Uber can be utilized … that could take care of a part of the problem,” said the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/misery-brought-about-by-the-covid-19-pandemic-unimaginable-says-bombay-hc-in-landmark-ruling/story-T4ObFyyffGW5bC0xTPbpAM.html
14-06-2020||Chandigarh||IMA PASSING OUT PARADE: Kapurthala Sainik School alumnus bags coveted Sword of Honour||Gentlemen cadet Akashdeep Singh Dhillon of Kairon village in Tarn Taran district in Punjab was awarded the coveted Sword of Honour at the Passing out Parade for the Spring Term-2020 of the Indian Military Academy (IMA), Dehradun, held on Saturday.The ‘Sword of Honour’ is an honorary sword awarded to that “gentleman cadet” or “lady cadet” who achieves an overall best performance during his or her entire training period at the IMA at Dehradun.Akashdeep passed-out from the Sainik School, Kapurthala, in 2016. His father Gurpreet Singh is a farmer, mother Birinder Kaur a government teacher and his elder brother Preet Dhillon is model-actor in the Punjabi music industry. Sainik School, Kapurthala, principal Lt Col Vikas Mohan said it was a matter of pride for the school. Akashdeep was an all-round sportsman in the school as he played volleyball at the national level and was also good at boxing, said JKP Singh, public relations officer of Sainik School, Kapurthala, adding that Akash was also sports captain in the school. His mother Birinder Kaur said: “It is a proud and emotional moment for us as Akash did lot of hard work to achieve it. The only regret is that we couldn’t attend the passing-out parade due to coronavirus pandemic, but we saw the live telecast of the event on television.” IMA STAFFERS, WIVES PLAY ROLE OF PARENTS A batch of 333 young officers graduated from the IMA in Dehradun on Saturday, but parents were not allowed for their passing-out parade for the first time in the institute’s history due to restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Wearing a face mask, Army chief General MM Naravane reviewed the passing out parade of 423 officers, including 90 gentleman cadets from nine friendly foreign countries.Instead, the academy’s officers and their wives placed stars on the uniform of the gentlemen cadets after their oath ceremony as a mark of them being commissioned in the army, an honour generally reserved for friends and family. The newly commissioned officers did not get leaves to visit their homes before joining their units due to the pandemic situation. They will join their units straight out of the academy. “Obviously, it felt bad that my parents couldn’t see me wearing the officer’s uniform despite living in the same city. But then, it is for the safety of all. We are thankful to our instructors at the academy who played the role of our parents and made us realise once again that we all are one big family,” said Abhishek Negi, 22, a newly commissioned officer from Dehradun. Samrat Thapa, 22, a Bhopal resident, said his father, a Colonel in the Indian Army, wanted to see him passing out of the academy. “Unfortunately, due to obvious reasons, he couldn’t come… he cried over the phone when I called him after the ceremony,” Thapa said. Sumati Gakhar, the wife of an Indian Army officer who put stars on the uniform of Gentlemen Cadets, said: “I felt extremely proud while putting the stars on the shoulders of these young officers along with my husband.” Lt Col Amit Dagar, the public relations officer of the IMA said earlier there was the ‘antim pag’, or the last step after the parade, which symbolised the conclusion of the training. He added that this season authorities introduced the ‘pahla adam’, or the first step, after the antim pag to symbolise the beginning of the new journey of the officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ima-passing-out-parade-kapurthala-sainik-school-alumnus-bags-coveted-sword-of-honour/story-JuOexxpvRO3VdLNa4XJwtK.html
14-06-2020||Chandigarh||No compromise on paddy, wheat MSP, says Sukhbir||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Badal said on Saturday that his party would never compromise on the assured procurement of paddy and wheat by the government agencies at the minimum support price (MSP) as it was a question of life and death for farmers.“This was a question of life and death for our peasantry. The SAD is in the government at the Centre to ensure that the interests of Punjabis in general and the farmers and the other poor segments are fully safeguarded,” said Sukhbir in a statement, adding that he saw no threat to the present MSP regime at this stage.“But if at any stage, the MSP and assured procurement are tinkered with, the SAD will not remain a mute witness to such injustice and will fight till the injustice is vacated. The SAD is fully conscious of the party’s historic role as the voice and the conscience of the people in every sphere --- from the farmers interests to the federal structure in the country. We will live up to those traditions and those expectations in every sphere,” said the SAD chief.He said the party will never be a party to any decision that seeks to change or dilute this arrangement. “I and my party was ready for everything in case the farmers’ interests come under threat from any adverse change in the present arrangement of official purchase. The SAD will go to any length, including launching mass action, in order to protect the rights and the interests of every Punjabi, including and especially the farmers who are the backbone of Punjab’s identity, ” he said.The SAD chief said that the procurement system in the country needs to be further strengthened and refined and its scope widened. It is necessary to diversify the range of the MSP regime in order to diversify agriculture, a key requirement for providing a boost to India’s rural economy, he asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-compromise-on-paddy-wheat-msp-says-sukhbir/story-pqSR37Am3sBwZziuaQnsdO.html
14-06-2020||City||Elderly farmer shot dead in Raikot village over land dispute||A 65-year-old farmer was allegedly shot dead by another farmer over a land dispute at Jhorran village of Raikot here on Saturday morning.The deceased has been identified as Jarnail Singh, 65, of Jhorran village. As per the police, Jarnail had bought a 6-acre land from the accused, Gurwinder Singh, 45, of the same village.Though the land had been transferred in his name, Jarnail Singh still owed ₹4.5 lakh to Gurwinder. Whenever Gurwinder used to ask for the remaining amount, the victim allegedly used to accuse him of not giving him the entire possession of the land.  Gurwinder reportedly wanted to sell another chunk of his land, but Jarnail was allegedly not letting any deal materialise by instigating the other villagers. “Jarnail was allegedly threatening the villagers that if anyone buys the land from Gurwinder, he will stop the water supply to the person from the common tubewell in the village,” inspector Harjinder Singh, SHO at the Hathur police station, said. The SHO added that on Saturday, Gurwinder called Jarnail to the field at 6.15am to settle the matter.“Both of them decided to meet in the fields. Gurwinder carried his .12 bore rifle along. Both of them indulged in a verbal spat and, in a fit of rage, Gurwinder took out his rifle and shot Jarnail from point blank range. The bullet hit Jarnail in his chest and he died on the spot,” said the SHO.“A case of murder has been registered against Gurwinder at the Hathur police station following a statement of Kamaljit Kaur, daughter-in-law of Jarnail,” he added. The victim’s two sons are settled in Manila of Philippines and in the US. Jarnail had also returned from Manila a few months ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/elderly-farmer-shot-dead-in-raikot-village-over-land-dispute/story-P1S9stv6fIRBrPPTyu6P3I.html
14-06-2020||City||Denied admission by 5 hospitals, 51-year-old Covid-19 patient dies in Thane||A 51-year-old resident of Lokmanya Nagar, Thane, died on Thursday after she was allegedly denied treatment by four private hospitals designated for Covid-19 treatment as well as the civic-run Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital in Kalwa.Last week, TMC commissioner Vijay Singhal had said private hospitals cannot reject patients. The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has now said it will inquire into the incident.“We are not aware of this situation yet, but we shall appoint an official to inquire about the incident. Despite repeated warnings, hospitals have been flouting norms and refusing patients, and this is a punishable act. We shall take necessary action to ensure that such practices are not repeated,” said Vishwanath Kelkar, deputy municipal commissioner, TMC.The woman’s 22-year-old son said she fell ill on Tuesday. “We approached our physician, who recommended some tests and gave medicines. However, the next day, my mother started experiencing breathlessness, following which we rushed her to a private hospital near our house. But they said they did not have enough ventilators and denied her admission. I then took her to three other private hospitals on my two-wheeler, as we could not arrange for any other vehicle. But the other three hospitals also refused to admit her on various grounds. We then took her to the Kalwa hospital, where she was given oxygen for an hour and discharged,” the son said.According to the woman’s son, the civic-run hospital had informed that ventilators have to be reserved only for emergencies. “She continued to find it difficult to breathe, so the next day, early in the morning, we rushed her to Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital. There was a lot of rush and for about an hour, we had to shuffle between departments to seek an admission. During the course of this period, my mother had not been given any medical aid, and her situation worsened. Finally, a doctor suggested a Covid-19 test. She passed away moments after she was admitted. If my mother would have received proper treatment on visiting the Kalwa hospital the first time, her life could have been saved,” the son said.The woman’s Covid-19 test result came positive the same evening she died, following which her husband and three children have also been tested for the virus and are awaiting their results. They have been quarantined at their home in Indira Nagar. The woman and her husband ran a shop near their home. While their 22-year-old works with a private firm, the other two children are studying. In similar incidents, a pregnant woman as well as a 13-year-old also lost their lives after they were not admitted to hospitals in Mumbra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/denied-admission-by-5-hospitals-51-year-old-covid-19-patient-dies-in-thane/story-gMvlprhKsuplP5m3LoXLaN.html
14-06-2020||Chandigarh||Lockdown has made my life miserable, says expelled Kerala nun||Catholic nun sister Lucy Kalapura, who was expelled from the Franciscan Clarist Congregation last year, said on Saturday that lockdown has made her life miserable and she was denied even basic needs, including food at the convent, and she even fears for her life. Kalapura, 55, was expelled from the congregation last year citing “serious indiscipline” but the nun said she was victimised for supporting the agitation for the arrest of the deposed bishop of Jalandhar, Franco Mulakkal, an accused in a rape case. Last year, Kalapura’s autobiography, ‘Karthavinte Namathil’ (In the name of Christ), had ruffled many feathers in the church. “The convent kitchen was closed to smoke me out. Since hotels are closed at times, I go without food these days. Sometimes people who know me bring food. It is strange the church is doing a lot of charity outside, but keeps one of its own tribe starving at the convent. It is inhuman and blatant violation of rights,” she told the Hindustan Times over phone from Mananthawady in Wayanad district.“I fear for my life. I have given a couple of complaints to the police, but no action was taken. Recently, I noticed some strangers near the convent. A section in the church wants to silence me somehow. But I will continue my fight till my last breath,” she said adding she will continue to stay at the convent at Karakkamala. Earlier, the Pope had turned down her plea to revoke her suspension.But the congregation denied these allegations saying she was flouting discipline of the convent quite often and it is finding difficult to go ahead like this. “She continues to flout discipline and raises wild allegations quite often. She was expelled from the congregation but she continues to stay there as an intruder. With her presence, we find it very difficult to maintain discipline and decorum of the convent,” said Jyoti Maria, provincial of the convent. She said last week, parishioners have prepared a mass memorandum urging authorities to vacate her from the convent. But Kalapura said she worked for the congregation for 35 years and she will remain at the convent. She also said a local court had stayed the move to evict her from the convent. But the provincial said they moved a higher court to vacate this stay.Kalapura said her harassment increased after her controversial autobiography was released in December last year. She alleged in her autobiography that sexual abuse and assaults take place in convents and seminaries and called for institutional reforms to cleanse the system. She was among many nuns who staged a sit-in protest in Kochi two years ago after police failed to arrest Mulakkal who was accused of raping a nun who later filed a complaint. The trial in the case began in a court in Kottayam in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lockdown-has-made-my-life-miserable-says-expelled-kerala-nun/story-39WwL7yZq41dfPIOmOW0sK.html

14-06-2020||City||Thane resident says nine-month pregnant wife made to shift between hospitals, Covid-19 reports mixed up||A 34-year-old nine-month pregnant woman from Balkaum, Thane, had to go through a harrowing experience after she had to shift between three hospitals owing to confusion pertaining to her Covid-19 test results, her husband has claimed. The woman has tested positive in her latest report and has been admitted to a Covid facility near Thane railway station. The woman was informed that she tested positive for Covid-19 by the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital, Kalwa, on Thursday, after which she was admitted to the Covid ward of Thane Civil Hospital at Tembhi Naka the same evening. However, on Friday, Thane Civil Hospital authorities asked her family to shift her to BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai as they did not have anaesthetic or Caesarean facilities. “We didn’t have her reports when they shifted her to Nair Hospital in an ambulance. Later, Thane Civil Hospital sent her report to Mumbai. But when the reports arrived, Nair Hospital informed us that the name and address on the report was of a different woman and my wife may not be Covid-positive,” her husband, 40, said. The family then got her to the Kalwa hospital where she underwent a test again and was found positive. Her husband has alleged that his wife was made to stay in the Covid ward despite not being positive, due to which she contracted the virus. “For four months, my wife had not stepped out of the house. So we were also surprised when she tested positive the first time. We have already suffered a lot. I want my wife and unborn child to get proper medical care now,” her husband, who works as an autorickshaw driver, said. As she is asymptomatic, she has now been sent to a Covid facility near Thane station. Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) said that there has been no mix up and the woman had been Covid-positive since the beginning. “Our lab [at Kalwa] has given the right report in which the name and address of the patient was correct,” said Thane civic commissioner Vijay Singhal said. Thane Civil Hospital said that though they may have sent Nair Hospital the wrong report, the woman had never tested negative. Kailash Pawar, civil surgeon of Thane Civil Hospital, said, “It is true that we had to ask her to shift to Nair Hospital as we are not equipped for her delivery. Our doctor only checked the last name and gave the report to Nair Hospital without verifying if it’s the same person. However, she should have asked for her reports at the Kalwa hospital where she was tested.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-resident-says-nine-month-pregnant-wife-made-to-shift-between-hospitals-covid-19-reports-mixed-up/story-caN4TGXAJ4zBNs4biQHkZP.html
14-06-2020||Chandigarh||Sukhna Lake, not malls, new crowd favourite in Chandigarh||The first weekend since the malls reopened on June 8 saw lackluster response, with the malls getting only a fraction of the footfall they used to before the Covid-19 lockdown. On the contrary, Sukhna Lake was a hotspot for residents, evident by its chock-a-block parking lots. Swadesh Talwar, a regular here, said the number of people at the lake on Saturday appeared to be even more than the usual days. “The lake’s main parking lot, as well as the area in front of the Lake Club, was full of vehicles, which doesn’t happen on an average day. Over 200 cycles were chained on the railing from the lake all the way to club,” he said.Police officials posted at the lake said the footfall on Saturday was around 5,000, while the number was between 1,000 and 2,000 on regular days. Despite their repeated appeals, the officials complained, people did not follow social distancing, while several joggers also kept their face masks lowered.“Seeing the pictures of large crowds at Sukhna, I have moved to Rose Garden, Sector 16, which is less crowded and safer,” said advocate Ajay Jagga, who used to be a regular at the lake.LOW FOOTFALL AT MALLSDeserted halls and corridors were the scene at Elante Mall, with little to no visitors. Shah Nawaz, manager of the Westside store here, said they had witnessed a considerably dwindled footfall since they reopened on June 8, and the number of customers had only fallen since. “Usually sales on Saturday are much higher than those on Monday, but that was surely not the case this weekend,” he said. Shoppers Stop also confirmed poor response through the week, while Friday and Saturday also saw barely 10% customers walking in, compared to pre-lockdown days.Pedestrian-favourite Sector 17 also saw barely any activity, which the traders attributed to Punjab government’s recent decision to restrict people’s movement on weekends. “Many people from Punjab come to Sector 17 over the weekend, but Saturday brought hardly any business,” said Neeraj Bajaj, proprietor of Sindhi Sweets. ELANTE RESTAURANTS STILL CLOSEDMeanwhile, restaurants at the mall remained closed on Saturday with the impasse regarding rent still not resolved. Tanushree Raina, who works as an image consultant in the city, said she wanted to go to Elante to shop and eat, but cancelled the trip as no eatery was open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sukhna-lake-not-malls-new-crowd-favourite-in-chandigarh/story-tTvI1oS0HULcgGECokDLKM.html

It facilitated his son’s admission into Chapman University.He paid another $100,000 for the admission of his younger son. He also paid imposters to write local British Columbian school exams for his sons.Sidoo, who is yet to be sentenced for the fraud, has reportedly reached a plea bargain with the US attorney to face 90 days in jail and a fine of $250,000 (Rs 1.8 crore).His sentencing hearing comes up on July 15.The “Order of British Columbia” is the highest award given by British Columbia province in Canada for top achievers in different fields.With this order, Sidoo has become the first person to be stripped off this award.

14-06-2020||Chandigarh||17 asymptomatic cops in Punjab found positive in random sampling||Seventeen Punjab Police personnel had tested positive for coronavirus in a random sampling of 7,165 cops doing frontline jobs as part of a special coronavirus testing drive, director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta said on Saturday.This translates into around 0.9% positive cases of the total samples for the police force, as compared with the average of 2% positive cases for the entire state, the DGP said.The special RT-PCR Covid testing drive started on June 1 amid apprehensions of a spike in cases in the wake of relaxation of the curfew in the state, and almost three months of multifarious frontline duties by around 48,000 cops working day and night during the state-wide curfew/lockdown.The DGP disclosed that of the 17 positive cases, 14 belonged to district police, two (including a cook) were from State Armed Police/Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB) and one from Punjab Home Guards (PHG). Sangrur has reported the maximum number of positive cases, said the DGP.While 1,868 of the 7,165 samples collected till June 12 had tested negative, results for 5,280 were pending, said Gupta, adding that the sampling process started on June 1, and efforts were being made to test a maximum number of police personnel posted in police stations and other high risk areas on a daily basis depending upon the spare sampling and the testing capacity available with the Health department. He revealed that all the 17 infected cops were in isolation, either in civil hospitals or in the Covid Care Centres established by the Punjab health department.The DGP had, through a video conference, directed all SSPs /CPs and IGs Ranges to conduct RT-PCR test for all police personnel with high risk exposure, with focus on personnel engaged in frontline roles in over 400 police stations of the 27 revenue/police districts of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/17-asymptomatic-cops-in-punjab-found-positive-in-random-sampling/story-DtnE4wv7xpelrifv3rsDrK.html
14-06-2020||Mumbai||State govt caps price of Covid-19 tests at ₹2,200||The state government on Saturday capped the price for Covid-19 tests (RT-PCR) in private laboratories at ₹2,200, down from the existing maximum price of ₹4,500. The charge can go up to ₹2,800 in case of home swab collection and delivering reports home.State health minister Rajesh Tope announced the decision after a committee of senior health department officials submitted a report. Tope said the price of the test in Maharashtra, the worst-hit state , is now the lowest in the country. The minister said that against the backdrop of testing being done in large numbers and the drop in prices of kits , the decision to reduce the prices of the tests was justified. He said that the four-member committee had given its recommendation for the revision in prices after analysing every aspect related to the cost incurred for the test.“Maharashtra has conducted the highest number of tests and the count is more than 6.25 lakh tests from 95 laboratories, including 42 private laboratories, across the state. The ICMR protocol for RT-PCR tests remains the same and there would be no compromise on quality. This has been another decision in the interest of the public and in the direction of curbing profiteering,” Tope said. He said that the home test charges, too, have been brought down to ₹2,800 from ₹5,200. The committee appointed under Dr Sudhakar Shinde, the state health assurance society’s CEO, submitted its report in a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-govt-caps-price-of-covid-19-tests-at-2-200/story-Z2kvEL8oc4rfKj373CX6TK.html
14-06-2020||Mumbai||Monsoon likely to arrive in Mumbai today, says IMD||The weather bureau on Saturday said the southwest monsoon’s onset over Mumbai is expected on Sunday, while changing its ‘heavy to very heavy rain’ warning for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) for the coming days. The normal monsoon onset date for Mumbai is June 11.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday issued an orange alert (be prepared) for heavy to very heavy rain on Monday and Tuesday and a yellow alert (be updated) for heavy rain across isolated areas for Sunday. Earlier on Tuesday, IMD had issued a yellow alert for the entire week and an orange alert for Sunday. However, so far, Mumbai and the surrounding areas have only witnessed traces of rain.Meanwhile, the northern limit of the southwest monsoon further etched into more areas of the state, covering entire south-central Maharashtra, parts of Vidarbha and Marathwada. The onset line passed through Harnai in Ratnagiri district, Ahmednagar district, almost entire Marathwada as well as Nagpur and Gondia in Vidarbha subdivision.“Conditions are favourable for the southwest monsoon covering Mumbai and the rest of the state by Sunday,” said Shubhangi Bhute, director, IMD Mumbai. “Heavy rain warnings have been issued for south Konkan, central Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha for the weekend. As monsoon advances over rest of the state, active monsoon conditions with heavy rain are expected for north Konkan districts, including Mumbai from Sunday onwards.”An independent meteorologist questioned the criteria being followed by IMD for onset declaration. “While monsoon has reached Nagpur as per IMD, it has not been declared for Mumbai yet. Both areas have nearly the same unfavourable wind pattern, but Nagpur got pre-monsoon thunder showers, which IMD used for declaring the arrival,” said Akshay Deoras, meteorologist and PhD researcher at the department of meteorology, University of Reading, the United Kingdom. Between Friday 8.30am and Saturday 8.30am, the city and suburbs received 1.5mm and 2.1 mm rain. However, heavy to very heavy rain with isolated areas receiving extremely heavy rain was recorded across south Konkan districts of Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri and Raigad.

Heavy rain was recorded from the evening onwards at Nashik, said IMD officials. Between Saturday night and through the day on Sunday, the city and suburbs can expect light to moderate showers with the possibility of heavy rain and thundershowers at isolated places, the weather bureau said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/monsoon-likely-to-arrive-in-mumbai-today-says-imd/story-7J3GD54y7EKzrWA0o8KkKJ.html

14-06-2020||Mumbai||Case spike in rural areas catches Maha’s eye; tally rises to 104,568||Maharashtra on Saturday reported 3,427 more infections to take the tally to 1,04,568, as the government looks at strengthening its focus on rural areas after a spike in numbers.The state, which had breached the 1 lakh-cases mark on Friday, has recorded over 3,000 fresh infections for four consecutive days.With 113 more deaths, the state toll reached 3,830, although 73 of them were from the past two days, while the remaining casualties were between May 27 and June 10. Mumbai, the worst-affected Indian city, saw 1,380 new infections and 69 more deaths, taking the tally and toll to 56,831 and 2,113 respectively. Over the past week, the state has recorded 21,600 cases and 861 deaths – an average of 3,086 cases and 123 deaths per day — till Saturday. Saturday saw the third highest single-day jump in cases.Meanwhile, even as Mumbai could restrict the virus spread to some extent, the spike in caseload in rural parts and districts like Solapur, Aurangabad, Yavatmal and Jalgaon remained a cause of concern for the state administration. The district administrations have been directed to ramp up health infrastructure, so as to contain the spread. While Mumbai’s daily rise in cases dropped in comparison to the overall state figures over the past three weeks, a few districts like Solapur, Aurangabad, Jalgaon, Akola and Dhule have registered a sharp growth in the past three weeks. Solapur’s case count rose to 1,620 on Friday from 522 on May 21, a day before the lockdown was relaxed substantially by reducing areas under red zones. Aurangabad’s tally rose to 1,126 from 457 on May 21, while Jalgaon’s count went up to 1,540 from 331. In Akola and Dhule, the numbers rose to 979 and 353 from 344 and 95 respectively. Mumbai accounted for 63.73% of the state’s new cases on May 14, 56.47% on May 28, 49.06% on June 4 and 39.10% on Friday. “We are implementing the Dharavi pattern in districts like Aurangabad to bring mortality rate down and effective tracing of patients. Thermal scanners and oximeters are being aggressively used in these districts that have witnessed a rising number of cases. Asha workers and other health workers are being roped in to form surveillance squads for tracing and testing. By doing this, the vulnerable and patients with comorbidities are traced, helping us in checking the mortality rate,” said Dr Sadhana Tayade, director, health services.The Central government on Thursday had expressed concerns over the high mortality rate and pointed at the possibility of a shortage of ICU beds in a few districts and cities of Maharashtra. The state authorities have directed the Mumbai corporation for the strict acquisition of beds in private hospitals, while district collectors in other districts are asked to chalk out plans for the addition of beds, anticipating the potential growth of cases in the near future. “Barring Mumbai, we have been able to cope with the demand for ICU beds. While acquiring additional stock of ventilators, we have also asked district authorities to trace vulnerable patients early so that they would not need to put on ventilators,” said an official from the state government. The recovery rate improved to 47.2% from 26.25% on May 20, as the number of recovered patients reached 49,346 on Saturday. The national recovery rate on Saturday was 49.95%. The mortality rate was 3.7% against the national rate of 2.88%. Of the 113 deaths reported on Saturday, 87 are from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), including 69 from Mumbai, eight from Navi Mumbai. Ten deaths were in Pune and eight in Solapur. 65 of the people who died were above 60 years of age and 83 of them had comorbidities.A total of 16,464 samples have been tested in the past 24 hours, with a positivity rate of 15.74%. Currently, 5,83,303 people are under home quarantine.Out of Mumbai’s 69 deaths, 47 patients had co-morbidities, whereas, seven deaths were below 40 years of age, 37 deaths were above 60 years of age, and 25 were between 40 to 60 years.As per BMC data, 795 patients recovered and were discharged on Saturday as the total discharges have gone up to 25, 947. The total number of active patients in the city stands at 28, 682.There were signs of improvement in one of the most vulnerable areas of the city, Dharavi, which recorded no deaths and only 17 cases on Saturday. Dharavi’s case count has reached 2,030.Meanwhile, BMC said that ICMR has approved its technique of plasma therapy to check for the “right quality plasma” with adequate levels of antibodies to treat Covid-19 patients as per the protocols. BMC-run Kasturba, Nair and KEM have got an approval for trial by the ICMR. The technique called Chemiluminescent Immunoassay (CLIA) can be used to test the plasma from a recovered patient for the quantum of IgG antibodies. In a statement issued on Saturday, BMC said, “Only a donor with adequate antibodies is selected, which allows quality plasma to be given to the patient. This will help to treat patients more effectively.”As part of its monsoon preparedness, the BMC’s insecticide department has destroyed over 1.08 lakh breeding sites of the aedes aegypti mosquito, known to spread dengue, and 333 breeding sites of the anopheles mosquito, which is the malaria vector. This drive took place between January this year till now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/case-spike-in-rural-areas-catches-maha-s-eye-tally-rises-to-104-568/story-7Bnm2lOAIL2wVSb0NLpskL.html
14-06-2020||Chandigarh||Cases spike, Punjab’s patient ratio on a slide||Even as there has been a sharp increase in the number of positive cases in Punjab lately, but state’s patient ratio (proportion of positive cases against samples tested) has decreased with nearly five-fold increase in testing in a fortnight.Analysis of the figures available with the health department reveals that state’s patient ratio decreased from 1.76% on May 25 to 1.09% on June 11. Sampling in Punjab has touched 10,000 per day from 1,500-2,500 in the last week of May, and the dip in the patient ratio is a good sign for Punjab.Notably, as per reports, some worst-hit states have decreased testing after spurt in positive cases in the past over two weeks.“Our testing has doubled since June 1 but the patient ratio of the state has revolved around 1% which is a matter of satisfaction for us. One out of 100 testing positive shows that the situation is under control,” Punjab’s nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said.As per the June 12 figures, Punjab recorded 2,986 Covid-19 patients out of 1,65,548 samples tested, which comes out to be 1.8%. With maximum cases, Amritsar district has the highest patient ratio at 6%.Since June 1, Punjab has tested 85,420 samples till June 13 at an average of 6,570 tests a day.PATIENTS DOUBLING QUICKLY NOWThe spurt in positive cases has brought down the doubling time of patients from 55 days on June 4 to 25 days on June 12. On May 18, patients in the state had doubled after 91 days. Punjab has detected over 700 Covid-19 cases since June 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cases-spike-punjab-s-patient-ratio-on-a-slide/story-W7PgbiMsCyjcg7HSC26YTL.html
14-06-2020||Mumbai||Housing society in Kandivli first to get Mumbai civic body’s nod to set up isolation centre within premises||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to permit housing societies and housing complexes to set up isolation facilities in gymnasiums and club houses inside the society premises to quarantine Covid-19 residents who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. BMC has stated that this move will help authorities and give a “homely feeling” to residents who have to be quarantined. In one such move, BMC officials said they have given permission to Vishwa Deep Heights housing society at Kandivli’s Mahavir Nagar to set up isolation facilities inside its gymnasium provided they follow the 11 conditions put forth by the civic body pertaining to the safety of other residents. Some of these conditions include sharing patient details with the BMC, having separate entry and exit points to the facility, not using the facility for commercial purposes, not using the facility as refuge area, arranging medical professionals, ensuring disposal of medical waste as per norms, using safety gears and following all protocols issued by the authorities. Sanjay Kurhade, assistant municipal commissioner of R South ward (which comprises of Kandivli), said, “We have given permission to the society located at Mahavir Nagar. It in a way, this move will help the BMC in ensuring that all citizens get the required treatment. If any society wishes to obtain permission to set up isolation facilities to quarantine its residents, they can apply at their local ward office. However, they have to follow all the conditions laid down by the BMC.”Though Vishwa Deep Heights does not have any Covid-19 case among its residents, the society is setting up the facility as a precautionary measure, said society committee member Nilesh Vyas. “Though we received the permission, we hope we don’t have to ever use it. We are only doing this as a precaution. We are ready with two beds as of now but we can increase three more beds, if required in the future,” Vyas said.There are 67 residential flats and nine commercial establishments within the society premises, Vyas added. “Three of our residents are doctors involved in the treatment of Covid-19 patients, and they have agreed to help us in case any case is reported from our society. Based on their guidance, we have set up some basic infrastructure, including beds with disposable covers, PPE [personal protective equipment] kits, pulse oximeter, hand sanitiser dispenser etc. There’s also an oxygen facility which can be useful during emergencies until a patient reaches hospital,” Vyas said.Earlier, there was a lack of clarity on whether the BMC will permit isolation facilities within housing societies. However, it gave its nod to set up the facilities in society premises after several elected representatives approached the BMC.Gopal Shetty, Bharatiya Janata Party parliamentarian from Kandivli, said, “I had requested BMC to issue permissions to set up isolation facilities in housing societies. This will help in fighting the shortage of beds, ambulances etc.”Earlier, HT had reported on Friday about how a housing complex, comprising four high-rise buildings, in Parel also plans to set up an intensive care unit (ICU) and isolation facility in their clubhouse and utilise their empty flats too for the same. There are around 20 medical professionals residing in the complex.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/housing-society-in-kandivli-first-to-get-mumbai-civic-body-s-nod-to-set-up-isolation-centre-within-premises/story-MMGE8nnvLfgQa41ov9iUUO.html
14-06-2020||Chandigarh||Anmol Narang is first Sikh woman to graduate from US Military Academy||Second Lieutenant Anmol Narang will create history by becoming the first observant Sikh to graduate from the prestigious United States Military Academy at West Point on Saturday.US President Donald Trump will deliver remarks at the 2020 US Military Academy at West Point graduation ceremony.“I am excited and honoured to be fulfilling my dream of graduating from West Point on Saturday,” 2LT Narang said in a statement on the eve of the historic occasion.“The confidence and support of my community back home in Georgia has been deeply meaningful to me, and I am humbled that in reaching this goal, I am showing other Sikh-Americans that any career path is possible for anyone willing to rise to the challenge,” she said.Narang will complete her basic officer leadership course at Fort Sill in Lawton, Oklahoma. Following the successful completion of BOLC, she will then head to her first posting in Okinawa, Japan, in January of 2021, according to the non-profit organisation Sikh Coalition.A second-generation immigrant born and raised in Roswell, Georgia, Narang had an early appreciation for military service due to her maternal grandfather’s career in the Indian Army.After she developed an interest in military service during high school, she began the process to apply for the West Point after her family visited Pearl Harbor National Memorial in Honolulu, Hawaii.She attended one year of undergraduate study at the Georgia Institute of Technology before transferring to West Point, where she proceeded to study nuclear engineering and pursue a career path in air defence systems, the media release said.In 1987, the US Congress passed a law that prohibited Sikhs and several other religious communities from maintaining their articles of faith while in the military, despite a history of diverse service and simple accommodations.The Sikh Coalition said that for 30 years, the visible Sikh articles of faith, including unshorn facial hair and turbans, were banned, despite being core tenets of the faith.In response, for more than 10 years, the Sikh Coalition has led a campaign, in partnership with other Sikh and civil rights organisations, litigation partners, and like-minded advocates, to ensure equality of opportunity for Sikhs Americans in the US Armed Forces.“While 2LT Narang required no accommodation for her articles of faith, her exemplary service to date underscores how diversity and pluralism remain core strengths of the US military and the country as a whole,” Sikh Coalition said.“I am immensely proud of 2LT Narang for seeing her goal through and, in doing so, breaking a barrier for any Sikh-American who wishes to serve,” said US Army Captain (CPT) Simratpal Singh, a family friend of 2LT Narang.There are an estimated 500,000 Sikh-Americans in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/anmol-narang-is-first-sikh-woman-to-graduate-from-us-military-academy/story-75bKmXINLWnRlNqbhXv0cM.html

Even after the reconstruction, the MC will check the quality before releasing the payment.” An RTI activist had also observed a one-day hunger strike outside the MC Zone D office on June 10 against the alleged corruption in bridges and roads branch of MC. He had sought a vigilance inquiry into the matter wherein poor quality roads were constructed in different parts of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/anomalies-in-road-contractor-directed-to-reconstruct-road-in-ludhiana/story-tgI5gheTSq5Ysm2owGMOfM.html
14-06-2020||Chandigarh||Markets in Ludhiana wear deserted look amid weekend lockdown restrictions||With the Punjab government imposing stricter lockdown restrictions on weekends, markets in the city wore a deserted look on Saturday. Many shopkeepers kept their shops closed while others kept waiting for customers.Shopkeepers rued that there was confusion among them and residents regarding opening of shops due to which many shops remained closed. Also, fewer vehicles were seen on roads. Paramjit Singh, president of the Malhar Road Shopkeepers’ Welfare Association, said ,”Until late on Friday evening, it was being said that shops will remain closed on weekends. But, the administration made an announcement that shops can open till 5pm on Saturday. Due to this, confusion prevailed and many kept their shops closed. Also, the timing is not suitable for business as residents do not leave their houses in the scorching heat”Inderpal Singh, a shopkeeper in the Chaura Bazar area, said, “There were no customers in the market on Saturday. Business is at an all time low and the government has made it worse by announcing a lockdown on weekdays.”Malls also wore a deserted look with shopkeepers ruing that business would be hit badly due to weekend lockdown restrictions, as most residents visit malls during evening on weekends.Manpreet Singh Bunty, president of Akalgarh market garment association, said,” It is another blow to traders who are already reeling under losses. There was no customer in the market and many shopkeepers had to close their shops without selling a single piece. The market association is contemplating agitation against the government in the coming days.”The bus stand also saw no footfall with the state government imposing restrictions on inter-district movement. Officials said services would resume from Monday onwards.Kuljit Singh Sodhi, station supervisor of Shaheed Sukhdev Thapar Inter State Bus Terminal (ISBT), said, “We had received directions from the head office and no bus departed from bus stand for any district on Saturday.

14-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram breaches 3k Covid-19 cases, 203 more infected in a day||Gurugram breached the 3,000 cases mark on Saturday with the state health department’s morning bulletin recording 203 new people as having contracted Covid-19 in the district in a day. On Saturday, the total number of Covid-positive cases in the district stood at 3125 cases, up from 2,922 cases the previous day.Over the past two days, Gurugram’s doubling rate has improved to 8 days (as recorded on June 12 evening), while the daily average growth rate in cases has also recorded a decline. On June 10, for example, the number of new cases was 9.8%. It dropped to 7.8% percent on June 12. However, experts said these minute, day-to-day improvements are irrelevant when the data is viewed over a longer period, such as the past one month (in which time Gurugram recorded more than half of its total number of cases as of Saturday). An analysis of district bulletin numbers since May 18 (when lockdown restrictions began to be eased) shows that Gurugram’s test-positivity rates are at an all time high (45.6% on June 12), while testing numbers have not significantly improved.From recording an average of 41 new cases per day in the last two weeks of May, the district is now is recording an average of 178 new cases per day, an increase of 338%, district health bulletin data shows. “This number is going to increase in coming weeks. High test-positivity rates, and shrinking of doubling rate, is a clear indicator that transmission of the virus has not been adequately controlled,” said Rajesh Kumar, epidemiologist and former professor of community medicine at PGIMS Chandigarh.In Gurugram, 10 patients are currently in critical care at Medanta Hospital, Medeor and Fortis hospitals. This is two-thirds of the 15 patients on life-support across the state.Meanwhile, Faridabad recorded 100 new cases on Saturday morning, followed by 14 cases in Bhiwani, 30 in Rohtak, and 16 in Ambala. Haryana’s total tally of Covid cases stands at 6,749 cases, of which 2803 patients have recovered, 78 have succumbed to the disease, and 3,868 are classified as ‘active cases’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-breaches-3k-covid-cases-203-more-infected-in-a-day/story-2BaEVAA0zDPzTv1kmA1zfO.html

14-06-2020||Delhi||Amit Shah, Arvind Kejriwal and Anil Baijal to hold discussions on Delhi’s Covid-19 crisis||Union home minister Amit Shah and health minister Harsh Vardhan will meet Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal twice on Sunday to review the Covid-19 situation in the state, which added 2,134 new cases and recorded 57 deaths on Saturday. The state government’s own expert panel will meet on Monday to discuss ways to augment the health care infrastructure, especially hospitals, and on Tuesday, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority will discuss the issue. The spate of meetings comes against the backdrop of a spike in the number of cases in the state -- Delhi has added 10,022 cases between Monday and Saturday, for a daily average of 1,670 — which ended Saturday with a total of 38,958 cases and 1,271 deaths. They also come as the state government is looking to aggressively increase the number of beds available for Covid-19 treatment, by attaching star hotels to hospitals and setting up facilities in large banquet halls. On Sunday, the home minister and the health minister will hold two meetings with Baijal and Kejriwal. Shah and Harsh Vardhan will meet the Delhi L-G and the CM along with members of the DDMA at 11am on Sunday, a statement from the home minister’s office said. The director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Dr Randeep Guleria and other senior government officers will also be present at the meeting to be helmed by the home minister.Shah and Vardhan will hold a second meeting at 5pm on Sunday to get a sense of what the municipal corporations are doing to fight the pandemic and help the government. This meeting will have the three mayors and commissioners of the East, North and South Delhi municipal corporations in attendance, apart from the CM, the L-G, Guleria and senior officials of the Union health and home ministries. Shah’s call for the back-to-back meetings came three days after Kejriwal met him to discuss theCovid-19 situation in the capital. After the meeting, the CM tweeted: “He [Amit Shah] assured of all cooperation.On Monday, the government’s expert panel will hold a meeting to review Delhi’s bed augmentation plan. This will be followed by a high-level meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), chaired by the L-G, on Tuesday, to discuss issues such as capping Covid treatment cost in private hospitals, reducing the current testing price of Rs 4,500, creating temporary mortuaries and crematoriums, and increasing the number of beds in the city. According to the meeting notice, seen by HT, the June 16 meeting will also discuss the possibility of “using large blocks of vacant flats” for setting up makeshift Covid facilities. It also talks of preparing large scale makeshift hospitals with contactless treatment based on the Mumbai model. On June 12, Hindustan Times, was the first to report that the Delhi government planned to convert its stadiums on the pattern of the NSCI Dome, in Mumbai’s Worli area. Maharashtra cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray, who is monitoring Mumbai’s Covid-19 bed augmentation plan, said that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has so far operationalised about 15,000 beds at various field modular hospitals, mostly stadiums.“Most of these field hospitals have contactless clinics, CCTV camera monitoring, remote sensing for patient parameters, and do-it-yourself processes for patients. These innovative measures have helped us operate these facilities with a thinly spread staff,” Thackeray added. The creation of more drive-through Covid testing labs and provision of a 24x7 telemedicine facility by a panel of government and private doctors will also be discussed in Tuesday’s meeting.Minutes after the agenda for the meeting was issued, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal released a video on social media urging doctors to chip in for the service. “I appeal to all doctors to volunteer for Delhi government’s Corona Telemedicine Helpline. Give a missed call now to 08047192219 to register. The people of Delhi need your support in this difficult hour.” Tuesday’s meeting will also discuss how many medical personnel will have to be recruited to operationalise the augmented bed capacity of the city. “Fixing price ceiling for treatment by private hospitals as some of them are charging exorbitant price and seeking huge advances. Fixing ceiling for charges of private ambulance services as some of them are charging huge price. Reducing prices being charged by private labs for Covid tests to make it affordable to general public… Send IEC [Information, Education, Communication] material on WhatsApp/SMS to all Covid positive persons/suspects immediately and periodically,” read the meeting notice issued on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shah-kejriwal-and-baijal-to-hold-discussions-on-delhi-s-covid-crisis/story-xrWEKfw9na8ErUIrtvdoML.html

It turned out to be a lot in Assam’s Darrang district as a Covid-19 patient was discharged from hospital instead of a recovered person due to confusion over their similar-sounding names.Officials on Saturday said the incident occurred two days ago when authorities of the Mangaldoi Civil Hospital were calling out the names of 14 recovered people for their release.The Covid-19 patient responded to a name sounding similar to his, which was in fact of a recovered person from his Dalgaon Sialmari village. He was then discharged instead, they said.But the hospital authorities quickly realised their mistake and sent an ambulance to bring the Covid-19 patient back to the medical establishment the same night, the officials said.The patient fortunately tested negative for Covid-19 in a test conducted on Friday and was discharged along with the person in whose place he was released earlier, they said.Hospital authorities said that the mistake was caused due to similar-sounding names of the two persons and also because their faces were concealed by masks.Darrang Deputy Commissioner Dilip Kumar Bora has ordered an inquiry into the incident and declared the mistakenly discharged person’s house a containment zone.Swab samples of his family members have been collected and sent for tests.Assam has reported over 3,600 Covid-19 cases so far, of which over 2,000 are active, Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said. Eight persons have died of Covid-19 in the state so far. Of them, four succumbed to the disease this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-patient-discharged-from-assam-hospital-due-to-confusion-over-names/story-nS84OY8xii2ghIW6MtCxcI.html

They alleged that they were charged the amount for anaesthetic services, when no such services were required for their treatment.They added that after they had been discharged from the hospital, they found that though the hospital is run by a charitable trust, which has availed several facilities from the state government, it did not provide mandatory free treatment to the patients belonging to the lower strata of the society.The bench, after hearing their petition, said that there are serious allegations made in the petition regarding the alleged exorbitant charges collected by the hospital, and directed the hospital to file an affidavit indicating if similar charges at the same rates were recovered from other Covid-19 patients admitted at the hospital.The court has directed that the affidavits be filed by June 19 and posted the petition for further hearing on June 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-seeks-report-from-charity-commissioner-after-bandra-locals-claim-hospital-charged-them-12-5l/story-GVKZRQCIe6Uwa4lyQ5D7XL.html
14-06-2020||Delhi||Shops shut for nearly 3 months, traders in ‘red zone’ Jahangirpuri seek nod to reopen||After being forced to remain shut for nearly three months, at least 8,000 traders in north Delhi’s Jahangirpuri, a containment zone, are demanding that they be allowed to reopen shops as they are now struggling to survive without a means of livelihood. Shops in Jahangirpuri had been shut since March 21, four days before the nationwide lockdown to combat Covid-19 kicked in. On April 8, Block B in this neighbourhood became the first of 12 containment zones to crop up across the locality. According to district administration officials, nearly 300 Covid-19 cases have been reported from the entire Jahangirpuri area, where around seven lakh people live, making this one of the most prolific hot spots in north Delhi. Of the 34 containment zones in North district, 12 are in Jahangirpuri. Officials said even though Covid cases rose sharply in the locality in the initial two months, only isolated cases are being reported now, but the authorities are still wary of lifting the curbs.They said it may take another week before they even start thinking of allowing markets to open.Traders along with local area councillor met the district magistrate (north) Deepak Shinde on Wednesday and requested him to make some arrangements to allow them to open shops in some pockets of Jahangirpuri where the number of Covid-19 cases is low.Jahangirpuri councillor Poonam Bagri said in other parts of the city, only those lanes are sealed from where Covid-19 cases are reported while markets are allowed to open with restrictions. But that was not the case in Jahangirpuri.“In Jahangirpuri, markets are still closed and shopkeepers and vendors have no earnings. We have written to lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal, and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal regarding the problems being faced by traders and residents of the area due to the closure of markets. Surviving without a livelihood for nearly three months is not easy for middle-class and lower middle-class families of Jahangirpuri,” she said.Bagri said some parts of Sadar Bazar, which was a containment zone, has now been opened after traders protested and raised the matter with the administration. “Shinde has assured us that he will conduct an inspection with the health department officials to assess the Covid-19 situation and allow shops in some pockets to open at least by next week,” she said.Rahul Juneja, member of Jahangirpuri B-C Block market association, said, “Items kept in the shops are getting spoiled -- rats have destroyed ready-made garments. We have no income, and, yet, we have to pay fixed charges for electricity and water. We are now struggling to survive and the situation will become worse if we are not allowed to open our shops soon.” Shinde said isolated cases have been reported from different pockets of Jahangirpuri and so the area continues to remain a containment zone and markets cannot be allowed to open.“Isolated cases of Covid-19 are being reported from the area. In that scenario, we cannot take a chance as Jahangirpuri is a densely populated area. As a precautionary measure, markets have to be kept shut for now. We are closely monitoring the situation and will consider opening markets in some pockets once there is some improvement in the situation,” he said.The district magistrate further said on the request of residents, the timings of grocery shops have been increased by two hours -- from the earlier 8am to 10am to 7am to 11am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/shops-shut-for-nearly-3-months-traders-in-red-zone-jahangirpuri-seek-nod-to-reopen/story-42ZOfXEHB59pXhPKW2jhfP.html

14-06-2020||Delhi||Ganga Ram hospital moves high court against Delhi government’s FIR||The administration of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital has filed a plea in the Delhi high court, seeking the scrapping of an FIR based on a complaint by the Delhi government for allegedly not following Covid-19 testing guidelines.The plea, which is likely to be heard on Monday, also sought the setting aside of an order passed by the Delhi government on June 3 that prohibited the hospital from testing for Covid-19. Earlier, on June 3, the the hospital was asked by the Delhi government in an order to stop Covid-19 testing, citing violations of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines.However, the order was later recalled on Saturday and the hospital authorities were again allowed to resume testing.The Delhi government had filed an FIR against the medical superintendent of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Rajendra Nagar for allegedly not following protocols for testing Covid-19 patients. The FIR was filed last week on the basis of a complaint by Delhi’s deputy health secretary, Amit Kumar Pamasi.The public relations officer of Ganga Ram Hospital refused to comment on the plea in the high court.The Delhi Medical Association had, in a press statement, condemned the FIR and called the case against the hospital’s health workers “highly demoralising” during a pandemic.The FIR has been filed under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code that allows a punishment of one month’s simple imprisonment and/or ₹200 fine or six months imprisonment and/ or ₹1,000 fine if the offence puts human life at risk. The IPC section can be invoked under the Epidemic Diseases Act, which has been in force in Delhi since mid-March.“The order of Health and Family Welfare Department regarding guidelines for tracking and monitoring of every Covid-19 suspected cases tested in various accredited labs across Delhi wherein it was mandatory for the labs to collect sample only through the Delhi government’s RT-PCR App. Further CDMO (Chief District Medical Officer) cum mission director, Central, mentioned that Sir Ganga Ram hospital is still not using RT-PCR app even till today (03/06) which is a clear violation of direction issued under Epidemic Disease Covid-19 regulation 2020,” a copy of the FIR read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ganga-ram-hospital-approaches-hc-asks-for-delhi-govt-fir-against-it-be-quashed/story-XiAYSP1KvMMSDKq6Adwm7H.html
14-06-2020||Delhi||Increase beds, ventilators, use govt flats as Covid-19 hospitals: HC to Delhi govt||The Delhi High Court has directed the government to increase the number of beds and ventilators for Covid-19 patients and also told them to consider using “ready to move in” government flats in the city as Covid-19 hospitals. The court told the government on Thursday that it could put beds and other infrastructure to accommodate infected patients in those houses. The detailed order of the court was uploaded on Saturday.During the hearing, a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan also asked all the hospitals in the city to upload the correct availability of “realtime bed capacity data” so that citizens would know about the bed capacity in hospitals in advance.The directions came while the court was disposing of a joint plea moved by several lawyers of Charter law chambers, through advocate Mridul Chakravarty, seeking proper implementation of containment guidelines, especially in Defence Colony of South Delhi (around 11 houses in C block had cases of Covid-19), and to ensure the availability of enough beds for Covid-19 patients in hospitals in Delhi.On June 11, advocate Chakravarty, appearing for the petitioners, contended that the Delhi government had not declared Defence Colony as a containment zone as per the guidelines issued by the Centre. He also submitted that more beds are required for Covid-19 patients as their number is exploding.Appearing for the Delhi government, its additional standing counsel Shadan Farasat, told the court that till June 9, they had 9,179 beds in the city, of which 4,914 beds have already been occupied and the rest are available for new patients. He also submitted that there are a total of 569 ventilators, of which 315 are being utilised and the remaining are available for use.He further assured the court that they are strictly following all the guidelines and directions issued by the Centre and by other competent bodies.Following arguments, the bench said that since a group of 11 houses in C block has already been made a containment zone, there was no reason to declare all of Defence Colony a containment zone.The court also said that the “world is presently going through Covid-19 pandemic affecting all sections of the society at large, and in a matter like this, the government should be given some degree of movement.” It said that both the Centre and the Delhi government are aware of the situation and have been issuing directions from time to time.“There cannot be any hard and fast mathematical solution to such a problem. In a situation like this, experimental based solutions are to be tested [sic].”During the hearing, advocate Chakravarty, the counsel for the petitioners, also suggested that there are “ready to move in” government flats available in the city which could be utilised as Covid-19 hospitals.The court, while appreciating the suggestion, asked the Delhi government to consider it when they formulate or amend their policy decisions. It also asked the government to consider the suggestions made by the Delhi Medical Association on June 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/increase-beds-ventilators-use-govt-flats-as-covid-hospitals-hc-to-govt/story-pHsNzS8AlIeKnTbRrDovMP.html
14-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt to hand out oxygen meters for Covid-19 patients in home isolation||The Delhi government is working on a plan to loan pulse-oximeters patients with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for regular monitoring of oxygen levels during home isolation. With the number of cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on the rise and limited number of hospital beds available, the government is working on a plan of treating as many people as possible at their homes itself.So far, 34,687 people in the city have contracted the viral infection. Of these, 20,871 are active cases or those still living with the infection. Data provided by the Delhi government shows that almost 70% of those with the infection in the city are currently in home-isolation.“Delhi Govt. to distribute ‘Pulse Oximeters’ to Corona positive patients who are under home isolation, for regular checking of their oxygen levels. AAP government is making all efforts to assist patients in every possible way,” read a tweet from AAP’s official handle.The government is procuring 1 lakh pulse-oximeters, a small clip-on device that has to be attached to the finger-tip to check the amount of oxygen in the body. Current guidelines say that Covid-19 patients have to be admitted to hospitals if their oxygen saturation drops to 90% or below (normal is 95 to 100%).“The body not getting enough oxygen is one of the major reasons for Covid-19 deaths. Now, many patients panic and rush to the hospitals after testing positive because they do not know what to do. However, if every patient in home isolation has a pulse-oximeter they can keep monitoring their oxygen saturation regularly and rush to the hospitals in case the oxygen saturation dips below 93%,” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department.The pulse-oximeter will have to be returned once the patient recovers. A pulse-oximeter costs between R 1,000 to 3,000.A district level plan is being worked out to ensure that all Covid-19 patients get pulse-oximeters. “The government is currently planning how to implement a pilot project to provide devices, such as a pulse oximeter and a wrist-band that can monitor temperature and perimeter control, to patients in home-isolation. These devices will not only ensure that the temperature and oxygen level of patients are monitored regularly, it will also help the district officials to monitor if such patients are staying at home or not,” said a senior district level officer.This is the best way to reduce Covid-19 mortality, added a member of the five-member committee, which has been set up to advice the government on strengthening of healthcare infrastructure. “Among patients who need hospitalisation, survival is the best among those who get oxygen early on. Now, how can the government ensure that people in home isolation reach the hospital on time and get medical assistance? Distributing the simple pulse-oximeter will allow patients to monitor their own oxygen levels and rush to the hospital in case of an emergency,” said Dr Arun Gupta, president of the Delhi Medical Council.The committee has suggested that the government would need to create over 40,000 hospital beds for Covid-19 patients with severe disease by mid-July. With the L-G now also allowing treatment of those from neighbouring states in Delhi, the government is planning to create 1.5 lakh hospital beds – some in stadiums, banquet halls, and dharmashalas – by July-end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-may-loan-pulse-oximeters-to-covid-patients/story-TsQZeC9GDyi1hBz3z5lFxL.html
14-06-2020||Delhi||Rs 500 fine for flouting quarantine norms, not wearing mask and consumption of tobacco in public||New Delhi: Flouting quarantine rules, not wearing masks, failure to maintain social distancing, and chewing and spitting tobacco in public will attract a fine of Rs 500 in Delhi from Sunday, according to new rules approved by Delhi lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal on Saturday that aim to crack down on those violating rules central to the safety protocol to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Baijal on Saturday empowered officers of the state health department, district magistrates (DMs), sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs), officers authorised by them, and Delhi Police officers to impose these fines on the spot. Spitting and consuming tobacco in public was a punishable offence earlier too with the same fine but this was hardly enforced by civic agencies.According to the rules, the enforcing agencies will impose a fine of Rs. 500 for the first offence and Rs. 1000 for the repeat offence. In case a person fails to pay the penalty on the spot, action under Section 188 of the IPC (disobedience to civil order) shall be taken against offenders . Section 188 of the IPC attracts a maximum fine of Rs 1,000 or six months imprisonment or both. These rules and fines are a part of the Delhi Epidemic Diseases, (Management of COVID-19) Regulations, 2020, approved by the L-G on Saturday. “The regulations empower the city’s secretary (health and family welfare); Delhi director general health services (DGHS); district magistrate, chief district medical officer (CDMO), sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) and district surveillance officer (DSO); and officers as authorised by the department of health & family welfare, Govt. of NCT of Delhi and district magistrates and zonal DCs of MCDs; and the officers of the rank of sub-inspector and above of Delhi Police to impose the fines,” a statement from the L-G office read.The move comes a day after HT reported how resident welfare associations and traders were disappointed with the government’s announcement that the lockdown would not be extended any further in Delhi.B S Vohra, president of East Delhi RWA front, an umbrella body with around 100 associate RWAs, alleged that the authorities were taking no action against people not wearing masks or not maintaining social distancing.“It is good that such fines have been imposed, but we hope it is strictly enforced on the ground. So far, we have seen extreme leniency from the enforcement agencies. There is hardly any presence of police or MCD officials to fine people. When you do not have enough manpower or resources to penalise those not following the civic norms of self-protection and hygiene, which currently attracts heavy fines under the Disaster management Act, then you need a lockdown,” Vohra said.The L-G’s office, in its statement said, “Fines will be imposed if any person is found violating the following norms -- 1) Observation of quarantine rules. 2) Maintaining social distancing. 3) Wearing of face mask/cover in all public places /workplaces. 4) Prohibition of spitting in public places. 5) Prohibition on consumption of paan, gutka, tobacco, etc., in public places.” The rule is valid for a period of one year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rs-500-fine-for-flouting-quarantine-norms-not-wearing-mask-and-consumption-of-tobacco-in-public/story-XWaenEDjMOjyzqdqgfxocJ.html
14-06-2020||Delhi||Prices for Covid-19 treatment at private hospitals in Delhi may be capped||Prices for treatment of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in private hospitals across Delhi might be capped, with the matter set to come up for discussion in the next meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Tuesday, as per the agenda of the meeting.“Fixing price ceiling for treatment by private hospitals as some of them are charging exorbitant price and seeking huge advances,” read the agenda of the meeting. The DDMA will also discuss fixing ceiling for charges of private ambulance services.There are 97 private hospitals in the city treating Covid-19 patients as on Saturday, according to the Delhi Corona app. The government had ordered 117 hospitals across the city with 50 beds or more to reserve 20% of their bed strength for the treatment of Covid-19. This has gone up to 80 or 100% beds in some of the hospitals like Moolchand, Fortis Vasant Kunj, and Sir Ganga Ram since.Saroj hospital in north Delhi had come into limelight after an internal communication of charging minimum Rs 3 lakhs for each Covid-19 patient went viral on social media. “It has been brought to our notice that an outdated circular is being distributed on social media about the charges of Covid-19 treatment at Saroj Superspeciality hospital. We categorically deny having approved or having billed any Covid-19 patients as per the charges mentioned in the said circular,” the hospital had said.The health minister on Saturday said that the government is yet to take a decision on whether the prices for treatment of Covid-19 in private hospitals need to be capped. The government in an order on June 4 had asked private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients to provide a list of prices of the wards and isolation, ventilator support, PPE kits, central line insertion, biopsy, Covid testing, CT scan, MRI, etc.“All the hospitals have been asked to share the rates that they are charging for COVID treatments. We will decide on what to do after observing rates of every hospital,” said Jain on Saturday. The Delhi High Court on Friday refused to give directions on a plea to prevent overcharging by private hospitals and refusal of treatment due to lack of funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/prices-for-covid-treatment-at-pvt-hospitals-may-be-capped/story-JXgBqJyy4QcE6XaHCJ85UK.html
14-06-2020||Delhi||9 months on, Delhi traffic police yet to refund fines||Nearly nine months after the Delhi traffic police accepted there was a technical fault in the setting of speed detection cameras on the Meerut Expressway (National Highway-24) and announced the reversal of around 1.50 lakh wrongly issued fines, the department is yet to repay at least Rs 8-10 crore that was collected from commuters. While the police moved a proposal to work on returning the fines in October after the issue was brought to their notice, senior traffic police and transport department officials confirmed that they could not find any provision under the Motor Vehicles Act through which the money collected as fines could be returned. Between August and October last year, the Delhi traffic police wrongly fined at least 1.50 lakh commuters on the Meerut Expressway, between Millennium Park and Ghazipur, for speeding above 60kmph even though the speed limit signage on the stretch indicated a limit of 70kmph. After several commuters who were issued fines raised the issue with the Delhi traffic police and threatened to move court , the department conceded its error and agreed to reverse the fines, saying that the speed limit boards were incorrectly placed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). The 1.50 lakh commuters include only those who drove or rode between 61-70 kmph but were fined because of the camera’s incorrect speed calibration.Nine months after this incident, several affected commuters are still awaiting a refund. The department’s estimates show that commuters paid a total of nearly Rs 8-10 crore as fines before the matter was brought to notice of the top traffic police officers. The commuters were issued fines of Rs 1,000-2,000 for each “offence”. Senior traffic police officers familiar with the matter said the wait could prove futile as there is no provision under either the old or the amended Motor Vehicles Act (MVA) to refund a fine that has already been collected . A senior traffic police officer, who did not wish to be named, said: “There was an internal file that was moved within the department to make provision for those who were wrongly fined on the stretch, but nothing came of it. There is no provision under the MV Act to refund fines. The only ones who benefited from the reversal were those who did not pay the fines.”The official added that several meetings conducted between October and December between the police and Delhi government’s transport department to find ways to refund the amount came up with no solution. Amar Singh, a 43-year-old resident of east Delhi’s IP Extension, said that he was fined twice for “speeding” on the stretch, once on August 25 and the second time on September 3, last year, and given 60 days each time to pay the fines. “So, basically the people who abide by the law and paid the fine on time are the losers now? ,” he asked. Singh and three of his neighbours, who were also fined on the stretch, plan to approach the courts. “It wasn’t just us; according to the traffic police’s own admission, 1.50 lakh people were wrongly fined and they are keeping the money unlawfully. If there is no provision for a refund, is there a provision to keep unlawfully collected fine money?” Singh added NHAI officials said that when the matter first came to light, the traffic police wrote to the department asking that the speed limit on the stretch be lowered to 60kmph. However, the request was denied because the speed limits were set and the signage was put up as per the prescribed norms.“We told the traffic police back then that the speed limits of expressways cannot be similar to the city’s. The limit of 70kmph was decided only after coming to a consensus with the traffic police because the earlier limit was 100kmph. The cameras have been re-calibrated according to our signage now,” said RP Singh, who was heading the Meerut Expressway project for NHAI at the time. Rohit Baluja, a road safety expert and president of Institute of Road Traffic Education (IRTE), said that if it is the traffic police’s responsibility to prosecute commuters for breaking the rule, they must also reimburse a wrongly collected fine with interest.“They must come up with the means of repaying the commuters that were wrongly penalised,” Baluja said.He also pointed out that every day, hundreds of fines are wrongly issued to commuters because of faulty cameras, improper road signage and unclear markings, but no one is held responsible. Delhi traffic police chief Taj Hassan did not respond to multiple calls and messages seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/9-months-on-police-yet-to-refund-fines/story-H262osrQSUpVLEIz8NDovL.html
14-06-2020||Jaipur||Monk arrested on rape charges in Rajasthan’s Karauli district; objectionable material recovered||A Jain monk has been arrested on charges of raping a woman in Karauli district of Rajasthan, said police on Saturday. Pen drives and hard disks containing objectionable material were also recovered from the room of the accused, they said.The 38-year-old monk was a native of Jodhpur and was staying in a Jain shelter home in Mohannagar locality of Hindaun town. On Thursday, the survivor, along with her sister-in-law, had gone to the monk to seek his blessings. “First , the survivor’s sister-in-law went to his room and the monk allegedly tried to molest her so she left the room immediately. Then the complainant went inside the room where the monk allegedly raped her. He also threatened to bring harm to her family with his special powers if she disclosed the incident to anyone,” said deputy inspector general of police, Bharatpur range, Lakshman Gaur.However, the woman confided in her family soon and they went back to the shelter home. The accused reportedly locked himself inside his room so the police had to be called.“On Friday, the statements of the woman and her sister-in-law were recorded before the court after which the monk was arrested. He has been sent to judicial custody for 15 days. A case against him was registered under section 354 (assaulting woman) and 376 (rape) of Indian Penal Code,” Gaur said.“On Friday, a team of the forensic science laboratory from Jaipur and a police team from Karauli also recovered a bag from the monk’s room at the shelter home. The bag had two laptops, 19 mobile phones, 33 pen drives, 4 hard disks and a packet of condoms. The hard disks had objectionable videos on them,” said a police official associated with the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/monk-arrested-on-rape-charges-in-raj-objectionable-material-recovered/story-5fCeECrh3JXljjY7CZtZSJ.html
14-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt orders nursing homes to treat Covid-19 patients||The Delhi government on Saturday ordered all nursing homes in the city with 10 to 49 beds to start treating Covid-19 patients. Only standalone eye centre, ENT centres, Dialysis centres, Maternity homes and IVF centres will be exempt from this order.“The occupancy of the beds earmarked for Covid patients is displayed on a real-time basis in Delhi Corona App. More than 70% Covid beds in the private sector are already occupied. Further, it is projected that there would be a requirement of more than 15,000 Covid beds till June 30, and by the end of first fortnight of July, the requirement would further swell up to more than 33,000 beds,” the order read.There are about 700 nursing homes in the city, most of which have around 20 beds, according to estimates by the Delhi Medical Association.“All nursing homes in NCT of Delhi having a bed strength of 10 beds or up to 49 are declared as Covid nursing homes. All such nursing homes are required to make their Covid beds functional within three days of issue of order,” the Delhi government order read.Action will be initiated against nursing homes that fail to do so, said the order issued by Dr RN Das, medical superintendent of nursing homes in Delhi’s directorate of health services.The order says that complete nursing homes have been converted to Covid hospitals in order to prevent intermixing of Covid and non-Covid patients.This was the major point of contention of several private hospitals when the Delhi government had issued orders to reserve 20% of the bed strength in 117 hospitals with 50 beds or more on May 24. The government has since asked some of these private hospitals to expand this to even 80% or 100% of their bed strength such as at Moolchand Hospital and Fortis Vasant Kunj.So far, 97 private hospitals have started treatment for Covid-19 patients, according to the Delhi Corona App.The number of admissions are on the rise, with 550 people getting admitted and 400 being discharged on Friday, as per data provided by the Delhi government on Saturday. As on Saturday night, the city had 9,724 beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, of which 5,449 were occupied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-orders-nursing-homes-to-treat-covid-patients/story-5Hw3m26q7ekl3Xj6G7dmyO.html
14-06-2020||Chandigarh||Businesses struggle to stay afloat in Ludhiana as pressure for rent mounts||Already reeling under losses due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown, it’s a double whammy for the city’s business owners who are at loggerheads with their landlords over the payment of rent.Reports have been pouring in about several traders on Malhar Road bringing down the shutters after failed negotiations with their landlords. Malhar road shopkeepers’ welfare association president Paramjit Singh said, “The rent for properties on Malhar road ranges from Rs 1 to 3 lakh a month. Most shops have remained closed for the past two-and-a-half months. Amid constant pressure from landlords over rent, many see no option but to move out.”While stating that it’s no one’s fault, as many landlords are dependent on the rentals for income, the traders say it’s better to reach at a mutual understanding as finding a new tenant would anyways be difficult for the property owners at this time. An eatery owner on Malhar road, requesting anonymity, said, “We used to pay Rs 2 lakh a month to the landlord. But due to the lockdown, there has been no business for the last two months and I don’t see the situation improving anytime soon. If my landlord remains adamant on the rent, I will have to shut my business.”Ghumar Mandi shopkeepers association president Pawan Batra says, “This problem is being faced by everyone. A few commercial property owners and their tenants have brought up this issue with us. We are trying to make both parties reach a compromise.”Chaura Bazar shopkeepers association president Parampal Singh Witty said, “Both the landlords and their tenants are in a dilemma over the issue. Some of them have settled the issue amicably as the tenants also do not want to leave the place of business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/businesses-struggle-to-stay-afloat-as-pressure-for-rent-mounts/story-FGpB79yV9sMSsvHrjLcmIP.html
14-06-2020||Gurugram||Parents divided over board exams as Covid-19 cases continue to rise||City parents are a worried lot with the pending CBSE and CISCE board exams slated to take place in July even as cases of Covid-19 continue to rise across Delhi-NCR. CBSE had conducted examinations till March 18 when it decided to put it on hold due to the pandemic. It then came out with a notification on May 18 to hold examinations for remaining 29 subjects from July 1 to July 15. As per the CISCE revised schedule, the ICSE papers (class 10) would now be held between July 2 and 12 while ISC exams (class 12) would be held between July 1 and 14.While several parents said that they were not in favour of children stepping out for the exams at this time, others said that they were taking precautions and preparing for the exams. Several also took to Twitter on Friday seeking a cancellation of the class 10 board exams.Jugnu Almeida, whose son has four ICSE examinations left to go, said that many parents like her were paranoid about children contracting the coronavirus disease. “We are hoping that the exams get cancelled. Children have been at home for the past three months and now they are being expected to step out. There is a fear that they may fall sick and even carry the infection back home,” said Almeida. She said that children were anxious about the exams and studying in a half-hearted manner.Puneeta Chadha Khanna, another city resident, said that there was a fear of community transmission at the rate that cases were growing and that not all schools had the infrastructure to conduct the examinations safely. Asha Johari, whose son is appearing for the CBSE class 12 board exam slated on July 7, said that she trusted the school to take precautions and was in favour of exams taking place as planned. “The number of exams that students are supposed to appear for are varying across streams and elective-choices. In the absence of exams, a uniform marking approach would be difficult and not acceptable to all. We are awaiting directions from the school regarding the protocols that will be in place in the examination centre,” said Johari.Meanwhile, at home, Johari has been taking steps to ensure that her son has a strong immune system. She has been relying on multivitamins, warm water, and other immunity-booster foods for her son, as he prepares for the pending examination. “We are just taking care to ensure that my son has a good immunity. On the day of the exam, he will be wearing a mask and carrying a sanitizer,” said Johari, adding that her son would be stepping out of the home for the first time in three months for the board exam. Monica Khanna, whose son is appearing for CBSE class 12 board examination, said that the school had sent out a standard operating protocol. It has asked children to compulsorily wear a mask and carry sanitizers. Instructions regarding physical distancing have been shared too and children have been asked to not socialise with fellow students. “We are trying to educate children as much as we can about various precautions. There is paranoia but exams also need to be given,” said Khanna.A CBSE official said there was no update or change in the schedule till now, adding that schools were directed to implement physical distancing norms at the examination centres. The CISCE also shared similar directions -- own masks, sanitizers, and stationery, while gloves were optional. Schools have already started preparing for the board exams. Aditi Misra, principal, Delhi Public School, Sector 45, said that the school was adopting various measures for complying with physical distancing norms.“The desks have been placed far apart from each other to maintain an optimum distance between students. We have also roped in extra guards to ensure that not more than two children enter the washroom at the same time. Similarly, not more than two people will be allowed at the water cooler,” said Misra. The school has also procured temperature scanners to ensure that children with fever are not sent to school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/parents-divided-over-board-exams-as-covid-cases-continue-to-rise/story-xaaQkEYm6Ct4MeLVjkerZJ.html
14-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram administration to form special task force to fight Covid-19||In a bid to review the containment measures for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the city, the additional chief secretary on Saturday held a five-hour-long meeting with senior officials of the police and district administration to discuss the preparedness against the pandemic.Vijay Vardhan, who holds the portfolios of finance, revenue, disaster management, home, jail, criminal investigation and administration of justice, discussed the Covid-19 situation in the city as the total number of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus crossed 3,000 cases in Gurugram.Vardhan directed the district administration to form a special task force to deal with the Covid-19 outbreak and its aftermath. He asked the deputy commissioner to involve doctors from Delhi hospitals, such as AIIMS, Safdarjung and others to plan a strategy for the future.Vardhan said there has been a sharp increase in the cases in the past few days and all the stake holders will have to work together and focus on the necessary arrangements required to control the situation. He further said that the Gururgam district administration will have to work much harder than other districts since the total share of the district in the Covid burden of the state was almost 51%. He also said the state aims to review if the authorities are undertaking effective containment measures.“We also want to assess the actual situation in the city. Gurugram is a major concern. The state will be reviewing the situation related to case recording, deaths, testing rates, availability of beds and personal protective equipment (PPE). We will also share ways of effective containment if required,” Vardhan said.Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner of Gurugram, during the discussion said that they have done a mapping of 400 doctors and their details are available on the district administration’s website. These doctors are connecting with asymptomatic patients through their helpline number 1950 and providing online consultation. Vardhan said that the doctors should be connected to the patients living in their close vicinity so that patients can get immediate support. Also, he directed to provide counselling to positive cases so that they do not slide into depression and fear.Highlighting the role played by city police, Muhammad Akil, the police commissioner, said that adequate arrangements have been made across the city, including vigilance, to enforce social distancing and the use of face masks. He shared figures of people arrested, penalised and booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the CrPc. “We have penalised 448 people for not wearing face masks under Section 188 of Indian Penal Code and we have booked 460 and 322 people under the Disaster Management Act. We have in total arrested 1,378 people for violating the government guidelines,” he said.Akil said they have made adequate arrangements in the 98 containment zones in the city, including vigilance, to enforce Covid-19 distancing and the use of masks.“We have deployed 1,850 police personnel in Covid-19 duty and we are rotating their shifts in 28 days. The personnel who are deployed in the containment zones are provided with additional protective gears and have been advised to maintain social distancing and not to touch the vehicles passing by and other articles unless required to ensure their safety,” said Akil.The police said their planning and implementation machineries are acting in concert to minimise the impact of the disease. “We are conducting regular meetings with the station house officers(SHOs) in person and over video conferencing to monitor their areas and to give daily updates.Around 85% of the patients of coronavirus in the city are asymptomatic in nature and are placed under home isolation, said officials.The police on Saturday made adequate arrangements in the 98 containment zones in the city to enforce social distancing and the use of masks. The police have asked the residents’ welfare association(RWA) members to strictly adhere to social distancing and health hygiene norms to protect their residents from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-administration-to-form-special-task-force-to-fight-covid-19/story-xzwfaRpeSC3r7GCrTB9aMM.html
14-06-2020||Gurugram||Food distress persists, most daily wagers unwilling to return soon: Report||Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch (GNEM), a civil society group, on Friday, released a report stating that daily wagers and industrial workers were the most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown, with monetary reserves for many dwindling to as little as Rs 500. The report — aptly titled ‘Caught in a Bind: A Status Report on Uncertainty and Distress Amongst Gurugram’s Unorganized Workers’ — states that livelihood insecurity among daily wagers remained extremely high despite the easing of the lockdown and gradual resumption of economic activity.Based on an IVR survey of 5,000 people conducted in the last two weeks of May, the report outlines that re-employment was tepid with 60% of daily wage workers and 42% of factory workers out of work. According to 45% of those who work in factories for a monthly wage, factories had begun operations but they were still waiting to be called back to work. At least 34% of permanent factory employees also said the same thing. The report attributed the reason for poor re-employment to social distancing norms that needed to be adhered to, due to which companies were only recalling a few workers who were being made to work for longer hours, often with no overtime.According to the report, 44% of self-employed workers had not yet been able to restart work owing to negligible demand and lack of capital to restart business. Due to financial distress, debt was also rising, especially among the self-employed. Out of those surveyed, 25% of the respondents did not take loans and relied on savings or help from family, while 30% took loans of up to Rs 2,000. Around 24% of respondents took a loan ranging from Rs 2,000 and 5,000 and 8% above Rs 8,000. Self-employed workers reported more debt, with 44% borrowing between Rs 5,000 and 8,000.The report stated that while demands for rent were a source of anxiety, such demands were not persistent. Only 25% of the respondents faced pressure from landlords to pay rent. Lack of rent waiver and cumulative rent owed to landlords, however, was a reason to worry for migrants.With uncertainty around income, food, and rent, many workers had moved back to their native villages. Out of those surveyed, only around 30% of migrants were keen on returning immediately, while 40% were planning to wait and watch. A higher proportion of migrants from Assam, Bihar and West Bengal were eager to return immediately, while around 64% of the respondent from Uttar Pradesh were willing to wait for employmentThe report also stated that the administration’s efforts towards tackling food distress were inadequate and implementation of distress PDS during the peak period of food distress (April and May) was delayed due to which hunger problems in the city had compounded. It says that the administration’s distress ration system was a non-starter, mired in opaqueness, and had failed to cover a significant population, especially those in industrial pockets. Around 37% of the respondents said that the withdrawal of cooked meal facilities had exacerbated stress for them as they were dependent on it.VS Kundu, additional chief secretary, said that the administration had carried out household surveys to assess requirement of those in need, after which ration had been distributed. “Ration distribution is an ongoing process and is expected to continue till the end of June at least. The administration tried to cover as many people as it could,” said Kundu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/food-distress-persists-most-daily-wagers-unwilling-to-return-soon-report/story-7wqUxHsCUQm0xzE188WxhI.html
14-06-2020||City||Gurugram: DTCP removes five gates, demolishes unauthorised structures in DLF Phase 2||Gurugram: The department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Saturday removed four gates which had been erected on internal roads in DLF Phase 2 after complaints from area residents that movement was hindered due to these gates. A DTCP team removed the gates, which were in the Q block, even as some residents resisted the decision, said officials. Apart from this, one of the external gates at an entrance of DLF Phase 2 was also removed. There are a total of six external gates put up by the residents at the colony’s entrances. Officials said that on the assurance of the local residents’ welfare association (RWA), they decided not to demolish the rest of the external gates and instead, give time to the residents to seek permission for them from the authorities.“The gates were removed as no permission had been taken from the authorities. We are not against the security and safety of residents but gates can be installed only after permission from the district administration. There are six main gates in DLF phase 2 and we have asked the RWA to seek approval from the authorities,” said RS Bhath, district town planner. He further said that the residents have also agreed that in case permission is not granted, they will get these removed on their own.Vinod Tayal, a member of governing body of DLF phase 2 RWA, said: “The internal gates of the colony can be removed if the residents face problems but the main entry gates should not be removed as the safety and security of residents of DLF phase 2 is dependent on them. We will take up the matter with authorities and resolve the confusion.”DEMOLITION DRIVEDTCP officials also carried out a sealing and demolition drive in DLF Phase 2 against house owners who had obtained occupation certificates before the lockdown but were taking advantage of the situation by constructing additional rooms on stilts, or had covered setbacks of their houses and indulged in other violations of their building plans.Officials said action was taken at 10 houses in the area where they demolished walls, rooms and minor additions in the structures. “We also sealed five houses which were unoccupied but due to the Covid-19 situation, did not force the labour to leave these houses. The owners will have to restore the structures as per the original building plan,” said Bhath.Earlier on Friday, a large scale demolition drive was carried out by the enforcement wing of the DTCP in Bhondsi in which 20 structures, including some built up houses, were demolished. “It came to our notice that plot owners in Bhondsi had taken advantage of the lockdown and constructed structures, after which action was taken. A survey is now being conducted to find similar violations across the city and action would be taken in coming weeks,” he said, adding that it has been decided now that instead of demolishing only a part of the building, the department will now remove the entire structure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-dtcp-removes-five-gates-demolishes-unauthorised-structures-in-dlf-phase-2/story-vKOWpXlMBs1wy0x1qM7sPK.html
14-06-2020||Gurugram||Number of containment zones in Gurugram increased from 66 to 98||With a rapid increase in the number of patients suffering from coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the administration on Saturday revised the list of containment zones, taking the total number from 66 to 98 in the entire district. As per the new order, Gurugram will have 94 containment zones, while Pataudi will have two zones, along with one each in Sohna and Farrukhnagar. Earlier, Gurugram had 63 containment zones, while Pataudi had two zones and Sohna had one. There was no containment zone in Farrukhnagar earlier.The new zones contained in the city include private condominiums, HSVP sectors and residential colonies.The total number of Covid-19 cases reported in the city till Saturday evening was 3,125. The city reported 203 cases on Saturday, 185 cases on Friday, 191 on Thursday, 217 on Wednesday, 164 on Tuesday, 243 on Monday, 230 on Sunday and 129 on last Saturday.The sudden spurt in the cases is being ascribed to the desealing of borders with Delhi and the opening of markets, offices and industry under Unlock 1.0. To better manage the Covid-19 situation in the district, the Haryana government appointed a new civil surgeon earlier this week.

14-06-2020||Mumbai||Talks begin to get local trains back on tracks in Mumbai||To make it easier for frontline workers and supporting staff to report for duty, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is expected to again raise the state’s demand that suburban railway services be resumed in Mumbai, during his video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 17.However, according to officials, discussions are going on between railway authorities, state officials and ministry of home affairs ,and local train services for essential workers may begin from Monday.On Wednesday, Thackeray had reiterated the need to resume suburban train services in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. He said frontline workers are finding it difficult to commute and many have not been able to join duty due to the absence of public transport. State health minister Rajesh Tope, during his video conference with Union health minister Harsha Vardhan on Thursday, requested railway services for those involved in essential services. After the conference, Tope said, “I have reiterated our demand for suburban railway services for essential and emergency services. I am confident the Union health minister would discuss it with the Prime Minister.”Railway officials in Mumbai on Saturday said no directions have come in from the railway ministry. “There are messages in circulation about starting of suburban trains... it is informed that so far, we haven’t received such instructions... We will update you once we receive instructions from competent authority,” Shivaji Sutar, chief PRO, CR, tweeted. Officials from the state government said several letters have been sent to the Centre after the demand was raised by the CM during his video conference on May 11.Train services are being demanded only for frontline workers and supporting staff involved in essential services. “There has been crowding in buses after we allowed private offices to operate at 10% of their workforce from Monday. This has been causing inconvenience to the people in the essential and emergency services. Many of them travel from far-flung suburbs. They are already in tremendous stress, and resumption of railway services would help to offer some relief,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-may-urge-pm-to-get-trains-back-on-tracks/story-0cidlfEStMaGR6jBU3v9lM.html
14-06-2020||Chandigarh||Police recover car used in firing outside liquor shop in Chandigarh||Chandigarh A Honda Amaze used by two men who opened fire at a liquor shop in Sector 9 on June 2, injuring two persons, was recovered on Saturday, police said.The car was traced to Jagadari in Haryana but the owner when questioned said it had been borrowed by 22-year-old Vainkat Garg from Ambala.Police later found that Garg was a close aide of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi and had harboured the gunmen who drove the car to Sector 9.Police have already arrested Garg, who belongs to Naraingarh in Ambala . Two men opened fire on the evening of June 2 at a liquor shop in the Sector 9 inner market, near police headquarters. A total 10 rounds from .22 bore and .32 pistols were fired at the shop owned by 69-year-old Ram Avtar Batra, resident of sector 21, who also runs a petrol pump in Sector 35.The gunmen have been identified as Rinku alias Topi of Pehwa and Davinder Chawla of Hisar. They are yet to be arrested. Chawla had in the past murdered a jail employee in Haryana and had jumped parole.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/police-recover-car-used-in-sector-9-liquor-shop-firing/story-kkMAgsQXN4lGaNe2o4oJwO.html
14-06-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Lodhi after lockdown||It is super-crowded. Lodhi Garden. There are totas, bayas, kala papeehas, puhyas, mynas, babilas, kauwas, ullus, gaurayyas... bulbuls, koyals, the beautifully named ram chiriyas, kabutars and, of course, the white battakhs too—the last of them hopping by the pond, in massive groups, showing no physical distancing, not bothered at all by the coronavirus pandemic.Most of these birds cannot be seen, of course — it is late morning. The Lodhi Garden’s avian dwellers tend to emerge out into the sky from their hiding spots in the evenings.But one can hear their sounds. And though it is impossible to distinguish the various species by their distinct chatter, one knows who they can be—thanks to painted boards dispersed across the garden with the names and illustrations of birds drawn cutely, like in a children’s textbook. At a time when everything that seemed ordinary has become extraordinary, a walk in Lodhi Garden is turning out to be the stuff dreams are made of. Strolling along its tree-lined pathways gives a visitor, marooned for so long at home due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown, the impatient energy of a spring uncoiling after long being compressed inside a box.There is a tantalising feel of freedom.The garden reopened just a few days ago following an ease in the lockdown. Entry hours are limited, for now—5.30am to 11am, and 4pm to 8.30pm.While it continues to be risky to reclaim the wider city (the virus is not slowing its spread), the hauntingly empty Lodhi Garden is emitting the vibes of a private park in your backyard that you never had. There is barely any human presence. Hawkers of kettle chai, cold drinks, ram laddus and namkeen packets, who would constantly be popping out from behind trees and shrubberies, are missing from view. Even the grass seems wild and untamed. The many dogs are lying lazily on the muddy hedges, perhaps to stay cool in the sweltering temperatures.Nothing has profoundly altered the garden in the two and a half months when it lay closed, and yet it is looking so different. Perhaps because of the long absence of its regular human visitors. At this hour, on any given day in the BC (Before Corona) era, the grounds would be filled with romantic couples of all ages who came here to escape the prying eyes of the world. Their current disappearance illustrates another human toll of the pandemic—undoubtedly a very many lovers must have been unable to unite in these difficult times. (Now a rare jogger passes by, without a mask.)In the old times, it was almost always impossible to find a place to sit on any park bench. But at this moment, in the new normal, benches after benches are lying vacant. The saddest sight is to be found in the garden in front of Muhammad Shah Sayyid’s mausoleum (the same monument where every evening in the pre-corona days, a small group of calligraphers would gather to attend their daily Urdu calligraphy class). Here is an empty green bench under a tree, with dry leaves dispersed all around it—as if it had been ages since any person stepped over to claim the bench with a beloved or a book. The setting strongly evokes the feeling of an abandoned refuge.You ought to at least toy with the idea of coming to Lodhi Garden now—carefully and with masks and sanitisers—to experience it in its newly-acquired eeriness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lodhi-after-lockdown/story-qh8zJSUyfqEa2sIX9JvQ3O.html
14-06-2020||World||Atlanta officer fired after fatal shooting of black man||Atlanta police said Sunday the department fired one officer and placed another on administrative duty for the fatal shooting of a black man who resisted arrest after failing a field sobriety test — a death that rekindled fiery protests in the city and also caused the police chief to resign.Body camera footage released early Sunday by Atlanta police showed 27-year-old Rayshard Brooks appearing good-humored and largely cooperative with the two white officers after being found sleeping alone in a car blocking a Wendy’s drive-thru lane.“I know you’re just doing your job,” Brooks tells one of the officers about 40 minutes into the encounter when he agrees to a breath test. After he takes the test, an officer tries to handcuff Brooks and he attempts to flee — resulting in a struggle that ended with his death late Friday.The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said Brooks wrestled a Taser from one of the officers and ran. The GBI released security camera footage from the restaurant that showed a running Brooks turn and point an object in his hand toward an officer a few steps behind him. The video shows the officer draw his gun and fire as Brooks continues to run, then falls to the ground in the parking lot.Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Saturday: “I do not believe that this was a justified use of deadly force.”Officer Garrett Rolfe was terminated while officer Devin Brosnan has been placed on administrative duty, an Atlanta police spokesman, Sgt. John Chafee, said in a brief statement Sunday. Rolfe had worked for the department since October 2013, and Brosnan was hired in September 2018.Police Chief Erika Shields, who joined the department as a beat officer in 1995, resigned Saturday after nearly four years as chief. In a statement, Shields called for Atlanta to “move forward and build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.”Meanwhile, a demonstration that began peacefully Saturday morning outside the restaurant where Brooks was shot grew more turbulent after dark. Demonstrators marched onto nearby Interstate 75 and blocked traffic while the Wendy’s at the shooting scene was set ablaze and gutted by flames.Atlanta police said Sunday that 36 people had been arrested in connection with the protests, but gave no further details.Brooks’ death at the hands of police inflamed raw emotions in Atlanta and across the U.S. following the May 25 killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.Some public officials questioned Sunday whether the shooting of Brooks was as clearly an abuse as Floyd’s death after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee to his neck.“The question is when the suspect turned to fire the Taser, what should the officer have done?” U.S. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, said on CBS’ “Face The Nation.” Scott is the Senate’s only black Republican, and among GOP senators working on a package of policing changes.Scott said the police shooting of Brooks “is certainly a far less clear one than the ones that we saw with George Floyd and several other ones around the country.”Asked about the death of Brooks on “Fox News Sunday,” U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson said: “I think this is a situation that is not clear-cut, like the callous murder that occurred in Minnesota.”Stacey Abrams, the former Democratic lawmaker who rose to national prominence with her 2018 campaign for Georgia governor, said “there’s a legitimacy to this outrage” that Brooks wound up dead after being found sleeping in a car.“We also know that a man taking a Taser from a police officer in Pennsylvania resulted in his arrest,” Abrams told ABC’s “This Week,” “but because this person was black, it resulted in his death.”In February, Pennsylvania State Police reported they arrested a 37-year-old man in Dover Township and charged him with aggravated assault and other crimes after the man grabbed a Taser from a state trooper and used it to stun the officer in the shoulder.L. Chris Stewart, an attorney for Brooks’ family, said Saturday evening the officer who shot him should be charged for “an unjustified use of deadly force, which equals murder.”Stewart said Brooks, a father of four, had celebrated the eighth birthday of one of his daughters Friday before he was killed.The GBI will pass the results of its investigation into the police shooting of Brooks to prosecutors in Fulton County, who will decide whether criminal charges are warranted against either officer.Body and dash camera video released by Atlanta police show more than 40 minutes elapses between the time Brosnan first knocks on Brooks’ car door at the Wendy’s drive-thru to when gunshots ring out. Rolfe arrives on scene about 16 minutes into the encounter.Rolfe is seen on body camera video administering the field sobriety test, followed by a breath test with Brooks’ consent. He moves to arrest Brooks after the breath test. While he doesn’t tell Brooks the result, the machine displays a 0.108 in video captured by Rolfe’s own body camera. That’s greater than the blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 grams that’s considered too intoxicated to drive under Georgia law.Both body cameras fall off during the struggle that ensues when Rolfe moves to handcuff Brooks. Gunshots are audible in some of the footage, but weren’t captured on video in any of the four recordings provided by police.The security camera video of the shooting released Saturday by the GBI does not show Brooks’ initial struggle with police.GBI Director Vic Reynolds said Brooks had grabbed a Taser from one officer and appeared to point it at the officer as he fled. He estimated the officer fired three shots.___This story has been corrected to show that Stacey Abrams ran for governor in 2018, not 2016.___Bynum reported from Savannah, Georgia. Associated Press writers Mallika Sen in New York and Regina Garcia Cano in Washington contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/atlanta-officer-fired-after-fatal-shooting-of-black-man/story-ZwLIAYmydscSjMZE3NUxCL.html
14-06-2020||World||Most Americans say wealth hasn’t improved during Trump years||The “Trump Bump” hasn’t benefited most Americans, with fewer than one in six saying their personal finances have improved since Donald Trump became president, according to a survey commissioned by Bankrate.com.Almost twice as many respondents said they’re worse off since Trump moved into the White House in January 2017, while about half of the U.S. adults polled, 45%, said their financial situation has stayed about the same.Groups likely to report doing better under Trump included men, those identifying as white, and those earning $80,000 or more annually.Covid-19 is only partly to blame. Three out of five of those surveyed said they failed to see any improvement in their personal wealth during Trump’s presidency, even before the coronavirus slammed the U.S., cratered the economy, and ate into stock market gains of the past three years.The benchmark S&P 500 index surged 58% from Trump’s election in 2016 to a record in February, when the start of the pandemic-induced recession began. The benchmark has since fallen 10%, while the jobless rate jumped as high as 14.7% in April from a 50-year low.“Despite low unemployment before the pandemic, income gains were slow in arriving during what we now understand was a 128-month long expansion,” said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. “It has become more difficult to climb the wealth ladder in our country.”About 42% of those surveyed rated Trump’s overall handling of the economy negatively while 35% say he’s done a good or very good job.Potential voters were almost evenly divided on which 2020 presidential candidate would be the better bet for their financial future. Trump and Democrat Joe Biden each got a bit more than a third of the support from those surveyed. The rest said neither candidate would be better, or they didn’t know.Just 35% of those who say their finances have been negatively impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak think their financial situations will improve by November’s election.The survey of 1,343 adults was conducted June 3-4 by YouGov Plc. No margin of error was specified.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-americans-say-wealth-hasn-t-improved-during-trump-years/story-vLNRiaHGDhJhljW3JtgEKJ.html
14-06-2020||World||Coronavirus: Europe reopens many borders, shuts out Americans, Asians||Europe is taking a big step toward a new normality as many countries open borders to fellow Europeans after three months of coronavirus lockdowns — but even though Europeans love their summer vacations, it’s not clear how many are ready to travel again.Tourists from the U.S., Asia, Latin America and the Middle East will just have to wait for now. Europe is expected to start opening up to some visitors from elsewhere next month, but details remain unclear.The European Union home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, told member nations last week that they “should open up as soon as possible” and suggested Monday was a good date.Many countries are doing just that, allowing travel from the EU, Britain and the rest of Europe’s usually passport-free Schengen travel area, which includes non-EU countries like Switzerland.Europe’s reopening won’t be a repeat of the chaotic free-for-all in March when panicked, uncoordinated border closures caused traffic jams that stretched for miles. Still, it’s a complicated, shifting patchwork of different rules. And although tourist regions are desperately counting on them, a lot of Europeans may decide to stay close to home this summer.That’s something tourism-dependent Mediterranean countries such as Greece are keen to avoid. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis acknowledged Saturday that “a lot will depend on whether people feel comfortable to travel and whether we can project Greece as a safe destination.”Greece has emphasized its handling of its outbreak, which saw only 183 deaths. Overall, Europe has seen more than 182,000 virus-linked deaths this year, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that also shows Europe has had 2.04 million of the world’s 7.8 million infections.Hard-hit Spain, which on Sunday moved forward its opening to European travelers by 10 days to June 21, is allowing thousands of Germans to fly to its Balearic Islands for a trial run starting Monday — waiving its 14-day quarantine for the group.“This pilot program will help us learn a lot for what lies ahead in the coming months,” Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said. “We want our country, which is already known as a world-class tourist destination, to be recognized as also a secure destination.”Border checks in some places have already wound down. Italy opened its borders on June 3 and towns on the German-Polish border celebrated early Saturday as Poland opened the gates. At midnight, the mayors of Goerlitz, Germany and Zgorzelec, Poland cut through chains on a makeshift fence that had divided the towns.Germany, like France and others, is lifting remaining border checks on Monday and scrapping a requirement that arrivals must prove they have a good reason to enter. It also is easing a worldwide warning against nonessential travel to exempt European countries – except, probably, Finland, Norway and Spain, where travel restrictions remain, and Sweden, where the level of new coronavirus infections is deemed too high.Many German regions have reimposed a quarantine requirement for arrivals from Sweden, whose virus strategy avoided a lockdown but produced a relatively high death rate.Czech authorities will require arrivals from Sweden to show a negative COVID-19 test or to self-quarantine – along with travelers from Portugal and Poland’s Silesia region.Austria is opening up Tuesday to European neighbors except Spain, Portugal, Sweden and Britain — and keeping a travel warning for Italy’s worst-hit region of Lombardy. France is asking people from Britain to self-quarantine for two weeks.Britain recently introduced a 14-day quarantine requirement for most arrivals, to the horror of its tourism and aviation industries, which say the move will hit visits to Britain hard this summer.Denmark is opening up only for tourists from Germany, Norway and Iceland — and only if they can prove that they’re staying for at least six nights. Norway also is keeping shut its long border with Sweden.“I realize this is a big disappointment. But the restrictions are based on objective criteria that are the same for everyone,” Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg said. “If we open too quickly, the infection can get out of control.”With flights only gradually picking up, nervousness about new outbreaks abroad, uncertainty about social distancing at tourist venues and many people facing unemployment or pay cuts, this may be a good summer for domestic tourism.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz are both planning to vacation in their homelands this year.“The recommendation is still, if you want to be really safe, a vacation in Austria,” Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg told ORF television, recalling the scramble in March to bring home thousands of tourists as borders slammed shut. “In Austria, you know that you don’t have to cross a border if you want to get home, and you know the infrastructure and the health system well.”The German government, which helped fly 240,000 people home as the pandemic grew exponentially, also has no desire to repeat that experience.“My appeal to all those who travel: Enjoy your summer vacation — but enjoy it with caution and responsibility,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said. “In the summer holidays, we want to make it as difficult as possible for the virus to spread again in Europe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-europe-reopens-many-borders-shuts-out-americans-asians/story-ftezYQdxGjohmCChC1aGRI.html
14-06-2020||World||Donald Trump’s rally dangerous move in coronavirus age, high health risk: Experts||After months away from the campaign trail, President Donald Trump plans to rally his supporters this coming Saturday for the first time since most of the country was shuttered by the coronavirus. Trump will head to Tulsa, Oklahoma — a state that has seen relatively few COVID-19 cases.But health experts question the decision, citing the danger of infection spreading among the crowd and sparking outbreaks when people return to their homes. The Trump campaign itself acknowledges the risk in a waiver attendees must agree to absolving them of any responsibility should people get sick.WHAT MAKES THE RALLY HIGH RISK?Trump’s rally will be held indoors, at a 19,000-seat arena that has canceled all other events through the end of July. Scientists believe the virus spreads far more easily in crowded enclosed spaces than it does outdoors, where circulating air has a better chance of dispersing virus particles.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention outlines the highest risk events for transmission of the coronavirus this way: “Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.” The CDC recommends cloth masks in places where people might shout or chant.Trump’s rallies typically draw tens of thousands of supporters. They usually stand outside in line for hours before passing through airport-style security and cramming into an arena, where they sit side by side or stand shoulder to shoulder. The rallies are typically raucous, with much shouting, cheering and chanting. Some people dance and jeer at reporters. Sometimes protesters are met with violence before they are removed by security.Many attendees are older, which would put them at higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19. It’s not unusual for several individuals in the crowd to require medical attention when the temperature rises.The rallies also typically draw supporters from surrounding towns and states. Some die-hard fans travel across the country from rally to rally like groupies for a band.Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute, called the upcoming Trump rally “an extraordinarily dangerous move for the people participating and the people who may know them and love them and see them afterward.”Trump supporters coming from neighboring cities and states could carry the virus back home, Jha said. “I’d feel the same way if Joe Biden were holding a rally.”OKLAHOMA CASES LOW BUT RISINGIn its final phase of reopening, Oklahoma now allows public gatherings of any size as long as organizers consider social distancing. Participants at any large gathering should stay 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart and wear a cloth face covering when distancing is a challenge, the state health department said.The state has a relatively low death rate compared with the rest of the nation, but new cases are rising. In Tulsa, cases are increasing, with 71 new cases reported Friday. The Tulsa Health Department already was investigating an outbreak linked to an indoor gathering of a large group of people.“I have concerns about large groups of people gathering indoors for prolonged lengths of time,” Bruce Dart, executive director of the Tulsa Health Department, said in a statement Friday. “It is imperative that anyone who chooses to host or attend a gathering take the steps to stay safe.”Dart said the risk of spreading the virus increases with higher numbers of people congregating for longer periods of time.Oklahoma health authorities said that anyone who attends a large public event should get tested for COVID-19 shortly afterward.Shelley Payne, director of the LaMontagne Center for Infectious Disease at the University of Texas at Austin, said the Trump rally meets every criteria for the riskiest type of event.“I would certainly recommend that people wear masks and try to keep as much distance as possible,” Payne said.Julie Fischer, an associate research professor of microbiology and immunology at Georgetown University, said the event could have wide repercussions for the country.“With a little bad luck, that scenario could end in the seeding of community outbreaks of COVID-19 across the U.S.,” she said.MASKS AND PRECAUTIONSThe Trump campaign has declined to respond to repeated questions about whether it will require attendees to wear masks, socially distance or take other measures to reduce the risk of virus transmission.Trump has made clear that he believes empty seats are bad optics. “I can’t imagine a rally where you have every fourth seat full. Every — every six seats are empty for every one that you have full. That wouldn’t look too good,” he said in April.Trump also insisted that the marquee event of the Republican National Convention — his acceptance of his party’s nomination for reelection — be moved from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Jacksonville, Florida, after North Carolina’s Democratic governor refused to promise he would not impose restrictions.Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, a former neurosurgeon, said Trump’s rallies will be coordinated with public health authorities to maintain safety.“As far as the virus is concerned, we have two choices: we can allow it to dominate us, or we can learn as much as we can about it and we can learn how to live with it in a safe, prescribed manner,” he said Sunday on Fox News. “And I think the second option is the one that’s going to be adopted.”WHY NOW?Trump has been eager to resume the rallies that are the centerpiece of his campaign. The president revels in his large crowds. The events let him vent and gauge the kind of rhetoric that will appeal to his ardent political base. They also help his campaign expand its voter databases and will serve as a contrast to Democratic challenger Biden, who has suspended campaign events because of the virus and hasn’t attracted the same size of crowds.But the decision to pull the trigger now was driven, in large part, by the mass anti-racism protests that have taken place across the country in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. Campaign and White House officials say the protests — and the limited public health outcry they generated — gave them cover. If it was OK for tens of thousands of people to march through the streets, demanding racial justice, why can’t Trump rally his supporters, too?Of course, the protests were held outside, with many participants wearing masks.“Any large gathering, whether of protesters or ralliers, is dangerous,” Jha said. But infection is less likely at an outdoors moving march than at a crowded event in an enclosed space, he said, citing the air flow.THE WAIVERThe Trump campaign, in recognition of the risk, has tried to protect itself from lawsuits with waiver language on its registration website.“By clicking register below, you are acknowledging that an inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists in any public place where people are present,” the campaign advised those signing up for the rally. “By attending the Rally, you and any guests voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19 and agree not to hold Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.” liable for illness or injury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-rally-dangerous-move-in-coronavirus-age-high-health-risk-experts/story-fTljZPrF32XYcYTeTT3cUI.html

14-06-2020||World||World War I to 1999 WTO trade protests: Why Seattle has a history of protests||Large protests in Seattle over police brutality and racial injustice have again caught the nation’s eye, but big, unruly demonstrations have been part of the city since shortly after it was founded in 1851 by settlers in a log cabin on a lonely strip of land along the Puget Sound.Demonstrators this week staked out several blocks near downtown Seattle after officers withdrew from a police station following violent confrontations. They named it the “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone,” demanded broad reforms and have faced blowback from President Donald Trump, who called them anarchist occupiers.Similar descriptions of Seattle protests have been used for more than 100 years, stretching from large labor movements before World War I to the massive 1999 WTO trade protests.“Seattle went from log cabin to the Space Needle in a very short period of time,” said Knute Berger, a local writer and historian. Large demonstrations here have been national news since the Wobblies — the Industrial Workers of the World labor union — were active in the area around World War I, Berger said.The city’s reputation as a hub of protest was sealed by the huge Seattle workers strike in 1919, when tens of thousands of workers walked out for days to demand better wages and conditions. For decades, Seattle has often been synonymous with unrest, especially for critics of social change, Berger said.“Back in the ‘30s, we were considered ‘the Soviet of Seattle.’ After WTO, the word was used as, well, ‘We don’t want another Seattle.’”Mayor Jenny Durkan addressed the city’s history with social movements this week when discussing the autonomous zone, noting that the quirky Seattle neighborhood has for decades been a hub for movements like gay rights and other social issues.“I’ve been going to Capitol Hill for almost 50 years,” Durkan told reporters Thursday. “I just want to say, I know there has been an acronym that it’s now the ‘Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.’ I’ve got news for people. It’s been autonomous my whole life.”In the Vietnam era, the Seattle Liberation Front was one of the most high-profile anti-war groups in the nation. Federal officials accused some members of trying to incite riots.More recently, it was the 1999 WTO protests that garnered Seattle worldwide attention. City officials had hoped the meeting of the international trade regulation group would be a coming out party of sorts for the fast-growing tech hub.But the city was overwhelmed by tens of thousands of people upset over what they saw as the inequities of capitalism and the exploitation of workers. Some black-clad anarchists broke windows and vandalized stores, hundreds of people were arrested and the then-mayor declared a downtown curfew to quell the unrest.In the 20 years since the WTO protests, Seattle has seen explosive growth, with Amazon adding tens of thousands of workers near downtown and other tech behemoths expanding operations.That growth has led to soaring housing costs and an economic divide that Berger said are underlying the current demonstrations.“The issues of social justice and equity have increased because of this enormous disparity,” he said.And being one of America’s youngest cities allows people to use it as sort of a blank slate, Berger said, and encourages people to come who want to make big changes — whether in business, innovation or social areas.The city is also notoriously difficult to govern.

14-06-2020||World||Coronavirus tests in US, White House may not be accurate: Experts||How accurate are the coronavirus tests used in the U.S.?Months into the outbreak, no one really knows how well many of the screening tests work, and experts at top medical centers say it is time to do the studies to find out.When the new virus began spreading, the Food and Drug Administration used its emergency powers to OK scores of quickly devised tests, based mainly on a small number of lab studies showing they could successfully detect the virus.That’s very different from the large patient studies that can take weeks or months, which experts say are needed to provide a true sense of testing accuracy.The FDA’s speedy response came after it was initially criticized for delaying the launch of new tests during a crisis and after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stumbled in getting its own test out to states.But with the U.S. outbreak nearly certain to stretch on for months or even years, some experts want the FDA to demand better evidence of the tests’ accuracy so doctors know how many infections might be missed.There have been more than 2 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. and more than 115,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Cases in nearly half of U.S. states are rising.In recent weeks, preliminary findings have flagged potential problems with some COVID-19 tests, including one used daily at the White House. Faulty tests could leave many thousands of Americans with the incorrect assumption that they are virus-free, contributing to new flare-ups of the disease as communities reopen.“In the beginning, the FDA was under a lot of pressure to get these tests onto the marketplace,” said Dr. Steven Woloshin of Dartmouth College. “But now that there are plenty of tests out there, it’s time for them to raise the bar.”The FDA said in a statement that it has already asked multiple test makers to do follow-up accuracy studies, although it didn’t say for how many of the more than 110 authorized screening tests. The agency also said it is tracking reports of problems. Accuracy has also been an issue with blood tests that look for signs of past infections.No screening test is 100% accurate. So details on accuracy are routinely provided for tests of all types, including seasonal flu, hepatitis, HIV and cancers. For example, rapid flu tests are known to miss 20% or more of all cases, a factor doctors weigh when treating patients who have symptoms but test negative.For now, most COVID-19 tests in the U.S. don’t give data on real-world performance, including how often the tests falsely clear patients of infection or falsely detect the virus. That information is lacking for all but a few of the roughly 80 commercial screening tests available, according to an Associated Press review.The government’s emergency authorization process “requires a lower level of evidence,” the agency said. Makers need only show that a test “may be effective” instead of the usual requirement to demonstrate “safety and effectiveness.” They would have to meet that higher threshold once the U.S. government declares the emergency over.Many of the commercial test makers submitted results from 60 samples, the minimum number required and mostly used lab-produced specimens of the virus. The FDA now recommends the use of nasal swabs or other real samples from people screened for coronavirus.Experts say larger patient studies patients are needed to assess a test’s true performance.Lab testing bears little resemblance to actual — sometimes imperfect — conditions at hospitals, clinics and testing sites noted Dr. Robert Kaplan of Stanford University.“You’re testing people in parking lots, the patients themselves are extremely anxious and often unable to follow instructions,” said Kaplan, a former associate director of the National Institutes of Health.Kaplan and others say those differences could explain why some tests are not performing as expected.Last month, the FDA warned doctors of a potential accuracy problem with Abbott Laboratories’ rapid ID Now test, which delivers results in roughly 15 minutes. The test has been lauded by President Donald Trump and used to screen the president, his staff and visitors to the White House.The FDA alert followed a preliminary report by New York University that found Abbott’s test missed between a third to one-half of infections caught by a rival test in patients screened for the virus.Abbott rejected the findings, saying the researchers did not follow the instructions for using its test. The company pointed to alternate patient studies, including its own, that have found the test successfully detects between 91% and 95% or more of virus cases when compared to other tests.But similar problems with ID NOW’s accuracy have been flagged in preliminary reports by researchers at Stanford University, Loyola University and the Cleveland Clinic.For now, the FDA is requiring Abbott to conduct follow-up studies in several different patient groups.The FDA’s emergency standards “are still high but there is a significant difference in the body of work that what would go into a submission under the normal process,” said Abbott vice president John Hackett. “Our normal process takes years to bring these out.”Requiring bigger studies of all coronavirus tests could provide valuable information, but it could also strain the FDA’s already stretched staff and resources, said Dr. Daniel Schultz, former director of the FDA’s medical device center.Dr. Colin West of the Mayo Clinic worries doctors and patients have put too much confidence in the current crop of tests, when an unknown number of patients with COVID-19 are likely receiving false negative results.Even a modest error rate can have grave consequences during an outbreak like COVID-19. West gives the example of a test that is 95% accurate at detecting the virus and is used on 1 million people. That would still result in 50,000 people being incorrectly told that they don’t have the virus.“The negative test does not mean that I’m off the hook,” West said. “We just need to maintain that level of vigilance until we have a better sense of how good these tests really can be.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-tests-in-us-white-house-may-not-be-accurate-experts/story-vbf4L0WqWywrbIJfq433NI.html
14-06-2020||World||Mass virus testing in Beijing after new cluster triggers lockdowns||Beijing carried out mass testing for the coronavirus on Sunday after a new outbreak in the city that prompted travel warnings across the country amid fears of a resurgence of the disease.The deadly contagion had been brought largely under control in China through strict lockdowns that were imposed early this year but have since been lifted.But a fresh cluster linked to a wholesale food market in the capital has sparked widespread alarm and raised the spectre of a return to painful restrictions.The National Health Commission (NHC) reported 57 new infections on Sunday, of which 36 were local transmissions in Beijing, all linked to the Xinfadi market.Another two domestic infections were in northeastern Liaoning province and were close contacts of the Beijing cases.The 19 other infections were among Chinese nationals returning from abroad.Liaoning was among several provinces to advise residents against travelling to Beijing due to the new outbreak -- along with cities such as nearby Tianjin and several in Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing.Some local authorities said people entering from Beijing would have to quarantine, state media reported.In the capital, lockdowns have been imposed on a very small part of the city that includes 11 residential estates near the market which supplies most of the city’s fresh produce.Officials said Sunday they planned to carry out virus tests on 46,000 residents in the area surrounding the market and had set up 24 testing stations.Everyone who works at Xinfadi also has to undergo testing.So far 10,881 people have been tested in the area with another eight cases diagnosed on Sunday. They were not included in the NHC’s tally earlier in the day that covered the previous 24 hours.“I went to Xinfadi market so I want to confirm that I am not infected,” a 32-year-old woman surnamed Guo told AFP as she queued in scorching heat at a stadium waiting for a virus test.“We were told that after the tests... if it is positive, we will be taken directly to the hospital.”- Lockdowns and closures -One of Sunday’s new cases was a 56-year-old man who works as an airport bus driver and had visited the Xinfadi market in early June before later falling ill, state-run People’s Daily reported.The meat section of the huge, sprawling market was closed Sunday and AFP reporters saw hundreds of police officers and security personnel plus dozens of paramilitary police blocking access.Efforts to trace those who had visited the market have begun, with companies and neighbourhood communities messaging staff and residents across the city to ask about their recent movements.A vegetable market adjacent to Xinfadi was open Sunday and trucks were arriving to deliver or collect stock.“Afraid? Not really” a delivery driver surnamed Zhang told AFP. “But anyway I have no choice -- I am part of the lowest class of society. So I have to keep working in order to make a living.”In nearby streets, residents were under lockdown and restaurants closed.Some people used a wooden stepladder propped against the gated entrance to one community to pass supplies to loved ones.A resident surnamed Chen told AFP he had made several trips with his car to the front gate of his compound to deliver food. “As soon as I finish delivering the supplies to my family members, I will go upstairs to join them,” he said.“After that I won’t be able to get out.”- Food fears -Covid-19 first emerged late last year and one of the first clusters was from a market in the central city of Wuhan that sold wild animals for meat.The latest outbreak in Beijing has turned the spotlight on the hygiene of the city’s food supply chain.State-run media reported that the virus was detected on chopping boards used to handle imported salmon, and that major supermarkets had removed the fish from their stocks.Beijing authorities ordered a city-wide food safety inspection focusing on fresh and frozen meat, poultry and fish in supermarkets, warehouses and catering services.One trader surnamed Sun, selling tomatoes and cherries at a central food market, told AFP there were fewer customers than normal.“People are scared,” he said. City authorities have closed nine schools and kindergartens near Xinfadi, while sporting events and cross-provincial tour groups have been stopped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mass-virus-testing-in-beijing-after-new-cluster-triggers-lockdowns/story-vzlfgswxfwkDXk44RYmr7H.html
14-06-2020||World||Rishi Sunak speaks out on racist abuse as child growing up in UK||UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Sunday spoke out about the racist abuse he faced as a child growing up in Britain, but stressed that the country has made enormous progress over time.The Indian-origin finance minister, who was born in the UK, revealed that the abuse felt far worse when it occurred in the presence of his younger siblings, as he was asked to comment on another set of far-right and antiracism protests in London over the weekend.“It’s the sort of thing that’s happening on your own it’s difficult enough but when I had my younger brother and sister with me at the time it was particularly upsetting; I wanted to protect them from it,” he told Sky News, when asked about his experience of racist abuse.“They may just be words, but they sting in a way that other things don’t… There is something about that [racist abuse] that cuts to your core,” he said.The minister stressed that violent clashes, of the kind seen during some protests in London on Saturday, were “both shocking and disgusting” and those responsible should face tough legal consequences.He said: “This has always been an open, and tolerant country and what we saw yesterday was not that. There will always be a small minority who maintain prejudice, and indeed are racist, but that is not overall the description I would ascribe to our country.“I think there’s been enormous progress that our country and our society has made if I think back to the time when my grandparents first arrived, when I was growing up.” Sunak, who is leading the UK’s economic response to the coronavirus pandemic, went on to encourage people to support the reopening of the country’s high streets from Monday when non-essential retail stores are allowed to reopen under Covid-secure conditions. The minister indicated that the government was reviewing the current two-metre social distance norm in order to assist businesses further.“People need to have the confidence that it’s safe... and I can give that assurance,” he said, in reference to the next phase of the easing of the UK’s lockdown from Monday.“The PM has put in place a comprehensive review of the two-metre rule. We keep everything under review... I can very much understand the positive impact it will have on businesses in being able to open,” he said.The senior Cabinet minister once again admitted “hardship” in store as steps unfold towards restarting the economy after months of lockdown imposed in the wake of the deadly virus, which has claimed over 41,000 lives in the UK.“I think, primarily, we need to reopen our economy safely and slowly, and that’s the most important thing, to try and safeguard as many of those jobs as possible. But then as I look forward, acknowledge that there is going to be hardship ahead. People are going to lose their jobs,” he said.“I want to make sure that we have the degree of support for them, whether it’s skills or other support, to help them get back into work. I want to make sure companies are encouraged to employ people,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-speaks-out-on-racist-abuse-as-child-growing-up-in-uk/story-4uO1qgwblfV08mhnQjHlrK.html

But France will apply different rules to visitors from Spain and Britain because those countries established different reopening schedules.France will gradually allow visitors from outside Europe starting July 1, based on the virus situation in countries of origin.The French government promised to ease entry for foreign students in particular ahead of the new academic year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-end-border-lockdown-open-up-to-europe/story-Lh5fbIC0ceIoSb1ICtvmsM.html
14-06-2020||World||Another African-American man killed by police amid ongoing antiracism protests||As the United States continued to mourn the death of George Floyd and protest against racism in law enforcement agencies, it found itself confronting the urgency of the issue as public anger erupted Saturday in Atlanta, Georgia over the killing of another African American man by a white police officer.Protestors blocked a major interstate highway and set fire to popular fast-food chain restaurant as outrage grew untempered by the swift resignation of the Atlanta police chief and the firing of the police officer who had fatally shot Rayshard Brooks, the black man, on Friday night.The police had found Brooks, a 27-year-old father of three, sleeping in his car in the drive-through of Wendy’s, a fast food chain. He failed a sobriety test and in an ensuing struggle with two officers snatched a Taser and was shot trying to flee, according to Georgia state investigators.Police chief Erika Shields announced a resignation within hours and Garett Wolfe, the officer who is alleged to have to shot Brooks, has been fired.“While there may be debate whether this was an appropriate use of deadly force, I firmly believe there is a clear distinction between what you can do and what you should do,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said at a news conference at which she also announced Shields’ resignation. “I do not believe that this was a justified use of deadly force and have called for the immediate termination of the officer.”The Atalanta shooting came three weeks after George Floyd, a 46-year African American father of five children, died under the knee of a white police officer in Minneapolis, triggering countrywide protests and an intense debate on the need for urgent police reforms to root out racism.Several demonstrators turned up outside West Point, the elite academy in New York for future US military leaders where President Donald Trump gave the commencement address at an in-person event in the middle of escalating differences with US military leaders. They carried signs and chanted slogans.Trump did not mention Brooks in his speech, but alluded to the context of the protests following the death of Floyd. “It was this school that gave us the men who fought and won a bloody war to extinguish the evil of slavery within one lifetime of our founding,” the president said.Trump recently shut down a move by the Pentagon to rename Army bases named after generals of the confederacy of states that had seceded from the United States and fought its army, and lost, from 1861 to 1865 to protect slavery and continue white supremacy. There are 10 such bases.But statutes of confederate figures — and others, going back to Christopher Columbus — continue to be toppled around the country. Protestors pulled down a statue Saturday of John McDonogh, a wealthy 19th century slaveowner in Louisiana, loaded the torn down part on two two trucks and dumped them in the Mississippi River.Newsrooms across the country have felt the impact of the continuing and growing protests on the streets. Several top editors and executives have faced scrutiny and punishment. There is no word yet about those responsible at Fox News, an unabashed conservative news channel and supporter of President Trump, for using a digitally altered picture of Seattle protests, which has since been taken down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-african-american-man-killed-by-police-amid-ongoing-antiracism-protests/story-ZuKkk36GqvihKGe8PZTHuO.html
14-06-2020||World||Covid-19: UK records lowest death toll of 36, shops set to reopen||The United Kingdom on Sunday registered the lowest day-rise in the number of dead from coronavirus – 36 – since lockdown on March 23, encouraging the Boris Johnson government to reopen non-essential shops with social distancing from Monday.The Department of Health said the cumulative figures of the dead was 41,698 (day rise of 36) and 295,889 cases (day rise of 1,514). The UK remains one of the worst hit countries by the coronavirus pandemic - there were nearly 1,000 day-deaths in April - but recent weeks have shown a decline.The Johnson government has been gradually reopening the economy, partly driven by the need to begin recovery amidst steep decline in GDP (20 per cent down in April). This, however, has prompted concern from public health experts that the threat from the virus remains.The decline in deaths and positive cases has been the sharpest in London, which was a hotbed in March and April. Mayor Sadiq Khan cautioned the people that the lockdown has not been lifted: “The virus is still out there…Stay at home as much as possible and avoid public transport”.Prime Minister Johnson visited the Westfield shopping centre in London on Sunday and said the government is reviewing the two-metre distancing rule, which is central to shops and other establishment reopening as before.According to him, the current infection figures allowed for “more margin for manoeuvre” in easing the social distancing regulations, but he insisted this he would work “very closely with the scientists at all times” and the decision would be based on “safety, health, and stopping the disease”.He said: “As we get the numbers down, so it becomes one-in-a-thousand, one-in-sixteen hundred, maybe fewer, your chances of being, two metres one metre or even a foot away from somebody who has the virus are obviously going down statistically, so you start to build some more margin for manoeuvre, and we’ll be looking at that and keeping it under constant review.”The people, he added, should be able to “shop with confidence” when non-essential stores reopen in England on Monday, hoping that there would be a “gradual” increase in the numbers of people returning to the high street.He said: “I am very optimistic about the opening up that is going to happen tomorrow. I think people should shop and shop with confidence, but they should of course observe the rules on social distancing and do it as safely as possible”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-records-lowest-death-toll-of-36-shops-set-to-reopen/story-a1zqwNNy4sp5vzTIv3P24J.html
14-06-2020||World||China’s Sinovac says its coronavirus vaccine showed positive results in trials||Chinese vaccine-maker Sinovac Biotech has announced “positive preliminary” results of phase I and II clinical trials for its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, CoronaVac, saying it can induce a positive immune response.The phase I/II clinical trials was designed as randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled studies. In total, 743 healthy volunteers, aged from 18 to 59 years old, enrolled in the trials. Of those, 143 volunteers are in phase I and 600 volunteers are in phase II, the Beijing-based company said in a statement. The vaccine induced neutralising antibodies in “above 90 per cent” of people who were tested 14 days after receiving two injections, two weeks apart. There were no severe side effects reported, the company said in a statement. The company expects to submit a phase II clinical study report and a phase III clinical study protocol to China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) soon and commence application of phase III clinical trials outside of China. Sinovac is collaborating with Instituto Butantan in Brazil to prepare and conduct a phase III clinical study. The company expects to share the full data on our clinical trials with the public through academic publications. Weidong Yin, Chairman, President and CEO of Sinovac, said, “Our phase I/II study shows CoronaVac is safe and can induce an immune response. “Concluding our phase I/II clinical studies with these encouraging results is another significant milestone we have achieved in the fight against Covid-19,” Weidong said.“We have started to invest in building a manufacturing facility so that we can maximize the number of doses available to protect people from Covid-19. Like with our other vaccines, we are committed to developing CoronaVac for global use as part of our mission of supplying vaccines to eliminate human diseases,” he said. Sinovac’s development of a vaccine against Covid-19 began in January 2020 in partnership with leading academic research institutes in China. The company received approval from China’s NMPA on April 13 to conduct phase I/II trials on its inactivated vaccine candidate against Covid-19 in China. There are currently more than two dozen research efforts underway to develop protective vaccines against the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19. In May, Moderna, a Cambridge, Mass.-based biotech firm, announced early and encouraging immune-response results for its experimental Covid-19 vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-sinovac-says-its-coronavirus-vaccine-showed-positive-results-in-trials/story-LhrmyQENHVtkYrJzmHdlNL.html

14-06-2020||World||At 44, Beijing sees sharpest rise in Covid-19 cases||China on Sunday reported 44 new Covid-19 cases in Beijing, the sharpest rise in the capital since the outbreak began last year, triggering fears of the second wave in a country that had efficiently reduced infection numbers even as the pandemic rages globally.Majority of the cases have been linked to the sprawling Xinfadi wholesale market – the biggest in Beijing – for vegetables, meat and seafood in the southwest of the city in the Fengtai district: the infected are either traders or buyers who visited the market.Beijing had reported six new domestically transmitted cases for Friday, and one for Thursday, leading local authorities to swing back into anti-epidemic mode on a “wartime” footing.The capital, a city of around 21 million residents, had lowered its emergency level to the lowest level earlier this month.The sudden spurt in cases in the city, home to the political elite of the Communist Party of China (CPC), is a reminder that no fresh cases even for 55 days -- as was the case in Beijing -- doesn’t mean that the virus threat has been eradicated.Two more domestic cases were reported from northeast China’s Liaoning province, the National Health Commission (NHC) said in its daily briefing on Sunday.Nineteen of 57 cases recorded on Sunday were imported cases, the NHC said with 17 of them reported in the southern province of Guangdong – they were all on a flight from Dhaka in Bangladesh to Guangzhou, the capital of the province.In Beijing, the city government said they were out to control the new cluster infection on “war footing”.“Beijing has entered a critical period,” Xu Hejian, a Beijing government spokesperson said at a briefing Sunday.The city has ordered testing of anyone linked to the Xinfadi market, after the district containing the market put itself on a “wartime” footing.Beijing shuttered tourist spots and suspended sports events scheduled for the week amid the new infections.Many schools, which had reopened in a staggered fashion in the last couple of weeks are expected to be shut down again.Thousands of workers and residents around the Xinfadi market were lining up for nucleic acid tests on Sunday – the government has directed that anyone who had visited the market May 30 onwards should head to the nearest of the 98 testing clinics to get the testing done.Besides shuttering the market, where coronavirus traces were discovered in imported salmon, authorities have launched closed-off management over 11 residential compounds in the vicinity of the Xinfadi market.Beijing health authority spokesperson Gao Xiaojun has said anyone in the city with a fever will be given nucleic-acid and serology tests for the coronavirus, a blood test and a CT scan.Medical facilities are not allowed to turn away patients with fever symptoms, Gao said.At least 10 cities, including Harbin and Dalian in the northeast of China, have urged residents not to travel to Beijing and to report to authorities if they have done so recently.More than 1,500 tonnes of seafood, 18,000 tonnes of vegetables and 20,000 tonnes of fruit are traded at the market daily, according to the state-controlled Beijing News.The total number of Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 83,140 while the death toll has remained unchanged at 4634 for weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-44-beijing-sees-sharpest-rise-in-covid-19-cases/story-LQaqXZvSWAiZm8hf6wpKZN.html

14-06-2020||World||Russia’s low virus death toll still raises questions in West||When Leonid Shlykov’s father, Sergei, died in a Moscow hospital last month after 11 days on a ventilator, the death certificate listed the coronavirus as an underlying condition but not the actual cause of death.“Yes, he was suffering from impaired kidney function and diabetes, but if it hadn’t been for Covid-19, he would’ve been alive,” the son wrote on Facebook. “If we had known the real number of infections and deaths … it would have helped us make the decision to hospitalize (dad) earlier.”The way Russia counts fatalities during the coronavirus pandemic could be one reason why its official death toll of 6,948 is far below many other countries, even as it has reported nearly 529,000 infections, behind only the United States and Brazil.The paradox also has led to allegations by critics and Western media that Russian authorities might have falsified the numbers for political purposes to play down the scale of the outbreak. Even a top World Health Organization official said the low number of deaths in Russia “certainly is unusual.”Russian authorities have bristled at the suggestions.“We have never manipulated the official statistics,” said Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova.Finding the true numbers during the pandemic is difficult, since countries count cases and deaths in different ways and testing for the virus is uneven.Still, several factors could contribute to Russia’s low virus mortality rate, including the way it counts deaths, a tendency among some officials to embellish statistics, its vast geography and the shorter life expectancy of its population.An autopsy is mandatory in Russia in every confirmed or suspected case of Covid-19, with a determination on the cause of death made by a commission of specialists, said Dr. Natalia Belitchenko, a pathologist in the medical examiner’s office in the region around St. Petersburg.She deals with coronavirus deaths almost daily, but said only about 20% of them have been attributed to Covid-19. In other cases, the virus was determined to be an underlying condition.“In the vast majority of cases, the pneumonia itself wouldn’t have led to death, had the underlying conditions not flared up to a point of becoming fatal,” she told The Associated Press.Unlike Russia, some countries’ official death count includes those who had Covid-19 but died from other causes, said Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program.“It will be important that the Russian authorities review the way in which death certification is done to reassure themselves that they are accurately certifying deaths in the appropriate way,” he said.Death counts vary around the world because countries underreported the number of Covid-19 deaths early on, said Ali Mokdad, professor at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. They ascribed virus deaths to other causes due to insufficient testing or initially only counted deaths in hospitals, he added.Some countries also are overcounting by including “presumptive deaths” — those who likely died of Covid-19 but were never tested for it, Mokdad said.What sets Russia apart, however, is a habit of obscuring embarrassing truths, said Judy Twigg, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University and senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The way mortality data is recorded in Russia is affected by a Soviet-era tradition of setting future targets for improving public health through efforts to reduce mortality from certain reasons, such as alcoholism or tuberculosis.Health officials “shift the way they code causes of death in order to try to meet those targets,” Twigg said.Pathologists told AP there is pressure from hospital administrators to produce better-looking reports.Requests and instructions to obscure certain causes of death in postmortems are “an inevitable part of our job,” said a pathologist in Siberia who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters.Data analysts say inconsistencies in Russia’s virus statistics suggest manipulation, such as regions reporting similar numbers of new cases for several days in a row, or the number of deaths in regional reports differing from those in federal reports.“I don’t trust official statistics, and I believe I have reasons not to,” Boris Ovchinnikov, director of the Moscow-based Data Insight research agency, told the AP. “But we don’t have any good alternative indicators for assessing the real situation.”Among the anomalies:— The governor of the Lipetsk region in southwestern Russia was recorded telling subordinates last month that “numbers need to be changed, otherwise our region will be judged poorly.”— In the Altai region in southern Siberia, a task force posted a daily infection update containing the words “for approval” addressed to the provincial governor. It quickly erased the words after it was reported on social media.— Unusual spikes in pneumonia deaths indicate possibility more virus deaths than officially reported by mid-May: St. Petersburg reported 694 pneumonia deaths, with 63 from coronavirus; the North Caucasus republic of Dagestan reported 657 pneumonia deaths and 29 from coronavirus.“Without doubt, there have been manipulations with statistics on the regional level,” said Gleb Pavlovsky, an independent analyst and former Kremlin political consultant, adding that it seems they did it “on their own initiative.”At the same time, he noted that a decrease in cases was a key factor for holding two big events on the Kremlin agenda that were postponed by the virus: a massive Red Square parade for the 75th anniversary of the victory in World War II and a vote on constitutional amendments that could extend President Vladimir Putin’s rule until 2036.Citing a slowdown in infections, Putin ordered the parade for June 24 and the vote for July 1. Most regions, including Moscow, also recently lifted tight lockdowns imposed in March even though daily numbers of new infections have remained high, hovering around 9,000.In a bid to dispel claims of underreporting mortality, the government released updated statistics for April showing patients who died of other causes while testing positive for the virus, as well as those who tested negative but likely died of it.If those were counted as coronavirus deaths, mortality would have been 60% higher than announced. Authorities insist they shouldn’t be included in the official toll, but even if all extra deaths recently reported by federal and Moscow officials were added, it would still be around 11,000.Russian officials credit early quarantine measures and quick expansion of hospital capacity that prevented the health care system from being overwhelmed. They also cite more than 14 million tests that helped spot asymptomatic cases that account for more than 40% of all recent infections in the country of 146.7 million.Officials noted that infections in Russia peaked later than in Europe, and deaths are now climbing more quickly.Experts say Russia’s statistical gaps may result from its outdated system of collecting mortality data: In many regions, a death certificate must be delivered by a relative to a local civil registry office. Many of those offices were closed or had limited hours due to coronavirus lockdowns.“So what we’re seeing now is insufficient data in many regions,” said Alexei Raksha, an independent demographer.He said data from civil registries he studied showed that some regions reported fewer deaths in April than in previous years. Deaths were five times lower in the southern republic of Ingushetia, while in Krasnodar, they fell by about 1,500 from the monthly average, a record low.“Some people just bury their relatives without going to the civil registration office,” Raksha said.Researchers expect most of these gaps to be filled in next year, when the Russian State Statistics Service issues its annual report.Raksha said Russia’s few virus deaths could also be due to less-frequent travel across the vast country, its low population density and lower social mobility. He also said because the country has a much lower life expectancy than the West, it has fewer elderly targets for the virus.___Follow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-s-low-virus-death-toll-still-raises-questions-in-west/story-DEaMrbRNawHnaRs3XDRnSO.html
14-06-2020||World||UN chief extends telecommuting at world body’s headquarters until July 31||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has extended the telecommuting arrangements at the world body’s headquarters in New York until July 31 in view of the social distancing measures and restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic. He said that the UN premises will be re-opened for diplomats, staff and journalists in four phases. Guterres, in a letter to the UN staff members on Saturday, said that after consulting with the senior management and “our medical services regarding the Covid-19 situation, I have decided to extend the current telecommuting arrangements at the headquarters complex through July 31, 2020. “We will continue to review these arrangements and will provide advance notice should there be any easing or further extension of these measures”. According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the contagion has infected over 77,00,000 people and killed more than 4,30,000 across the world. The US is the worst affected country with over 2.07 million cases and more than 1,15,000 deaths. The Covid-19, which originated in China’s Wuhan city in December last year, has also battered the world economy with the International Monetary Fund saying that the global economy is bound to suffer a “severe recession”. Scientists are racing against time to find a vaccine or medicine for its treatment. Telecommuting was implemented at the UN headquarters from March 16 as the Covid-19 cases were increasing steadily in the state and the arrangements have been extended periodically, keeping in mind the coronavirus situation on ground. New York has finally turned the tide and is now reporting record low number of hospitaliSations, daily infections and deaths. Guterres said that the personnel are actively preparing the UN buildings for a return in four phases. During the current phase (Phase Zero), the aim is to keep the footprint at the headquarters complex below 200 people – staff and delegates. The Department of Operational Support is doing a deep cleaning of the premises, placing signage around the buildings to guide staff on physical distancing and making other arrangements to lower the exposure risk for returning personnel and delegates, which is envisaged to start in Phase Two when the UN gradually moves from 10 to 40 per cent occupancy. While a date for Phase One has not yet been set, Guterres said that during the first phase, only those functions that need to be performed on site will be allowed and the vast majority of staff will continue to telecommute. In this phase, not more than 400 people would be allowed at the headquarters complex on any given day, and physical distancing will be strictly enforced for common spaces. The UNGA is gearing to conduct elections for the President of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly, non-permanent members of the Security Council and election of members of the Economic and Social Council, and has put in place special voting arrangements. The elections will be held simultaneously on June 17 from 9:00 AM (local time) in the General Assembly Hall. Eight time slots have been allocated to member states to cast their ballots in the General Assembly Hall, in adherence to the social distancing guidelines. UN General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande has also recommended that Heads of State and Government and Ministers address the high-level General Assembly session in September through pre-recorded video statements as Covid-19-related restrictions on international travel and large in-person meetings are likely to be in place in the coming months. In a communication to the 193 UN member states last week, Muhammad-Bande said that the General Assembly should consider holding the General Debate and other meetings scheduled for the high-level week of the 75th session of the General Assembly “in a different format” since limitations on international travel and convening of large in-person meetings as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, may, in varying degrees, still be in effect in September. The new format will mean that it will be for the first time in the world organisation’s 75-year history that Heads of State and Government will not gather here for the high-level week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-extends-telecommuting-at-world-body-s-headquarters-until-july-31/story-SnQlFLaYUl5wRfXCB3BWJL.html

One hundred years later, the northern US state on Friday pardoned another black man convicted of the crime, which he repeatedly denied committing.Max Mason, who died in 1942, has become the first person to benefit from a posthumous pardon in Minnesota, a potent symbolic action at a time when Americans are confronting the roots of a racism that still taints substantial portions of society.The pardon request was filed well before the May 25 death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes.The killing, caught on video, triggered coast-to-coast protests, making the Mason pardon timely.“100 years late, overdue justice has been done,” Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said on Twitter.“The last weeks in MN have shown us we have a need for a better quality of justice. A pardon for Max Mason is another long-delayed step toward it.” On June 14 of 1920, young white woman Irene Tusken and a male friend attended the circus in Duluth. The next day, the man told his father they had been attacked by black circus troupe members and that Tusken was raped.Police rounded up and interrogated several black men including Mason, but the couple was unable to identify anyone as one of the attackers.According to court documents, a doctor examined the woman but could find no evidence of assault.Mason was released, and he rejoined the traveling circus as it departed Duluth. But police re-arrested him along with several other men. Later that night, an angry mob broke into the police station and grabbed three men, dragging them through the streets before hanging them in front of thousands of people.Duluth is the home town of famed folk singer Bob Dylan, whose 1965 song “Desolation Row” was written in part about the crime.The city has apologized for the lynching and in 2003 erected a memorial to the three victims.Mason escaped the fate of those three men. But he was sentenced to 30 years in prison, in part because it was learned that he and Tusken were both infected with gonorrhea, a common venereal disease.“If he had been a white man, I am rather doubtful if he would have been convicted,” county attorney Mason Forbes said in 1923 pardon request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/100-years-on-us-state-pardons-man-accused-of-rape-tied-to-lynching/story-zK1CJlVVpz2JCT06lG27ML.html

Waving banners with rainbows on them and sticking temporary rainbow tattoos on their cheeks, participants ran two routes through the city centre, ranging from 6 to 12 kilometres (4-7 miles). “Raise The Pride”, which will also include talks and workshops, runs from June 13 to 21 and coincides with similar events in other cities around the world for Pride month. “It’s my first time to join the Pride Run. I want to join because I am a cross-country racer in the school and I stand with equal rights as an LGBTQ member,” said Jacky Zhou, 16, as she prepared for the run.“I hope this running event can help us promote the power of the rainbow. I am so excited now and I hope I can finish it.”Social distancing restrictions, imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, have largely been lifted in Shanghai in recent months after a sharp drop in nationwide cases, although the capital Beijing is grappling with a new cluster of coronavirus infections.Homosexuality is legal in China and the country stopped classifying it as a mental disorder in 2001. However same-sex marriage is not recognised and concerns over stigma still dissuades people from coming out to their families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eighth-annual-pride-run-kicks-off-in-shanghai/story-4oNSWrOiYP7i2nGy66wpJK.html

Ankara is providing military and diplomatic support to Libya’s United Nations-recognized administration, while Russia backs rival militia commander Khalifa Haftar. In Syria, the Russian-backed government aims to retake Idlib from Islamist militants, while Turkey has vowed to never let that happen.Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif will also be in Turkey June 14-15, according to a separate statement. “During the visit, all aspects of our bilateral relations will be discussed and views on regional and international issues will be exchanged,” the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-sends-ministers-to-turkey-amid-clash-over-syria-libya/story-VJU0IbokSPddLoTFnj4IjJ.html

The women were found with a bag containing a number of spray-paint cans, the police said in a statement. They were refused bail and will be charged with the destroying and damaging property, it said. Anti-racism protesters, who have taken to the streets following the death of African American George Floyd in police custody, are demanding that the legacies of some of the architects of Europe’s empire building be revisited and their statues be torn down.From Cecil Rhodes in England to Christopher Columbus in the United States and King Leopold II in Belgium, statues of empire builders have been under attack in recent weeks around the world, sometimes from the descendants of those they once colonised.Cook’s statute was promptly cleaned by Sydney council workers on Sunday morning, a police spokeswoman said. Police in the neighbouring state of Victoria are also investigating the weekend defacing of the statues of two former Australian prime ministers at a Ballarat park.In New Zealand, thousands marched the streets of Auckland and Wellington chanting, “I can’t breathe” - a phrase the handcuffed Floyd repeated before dying as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.Protesters in Auckland carried Black Lives Matter signs and marched through the city’s central district towards the US consulate, chanting “Shame”, while Maori community members danced outside the building, the news website Stuff reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-police-arrest-two-after-captain-cook-statue-defaced/story-2PRa84wKPCjZfKLBnywNDP.html
14-06-2020||World||China, Korea, Egypt record rise in Covid cases as curbs on business, travel ease||China reported its highest daily total of new coronavirus cases in two months on Sunday and infections in South Korea also rose, showing how the disease can come back as curbs on business and travel are lifted.Meanwhile, Egypt reported its biggest daily increase on Saturday. Infections were rising in some US states as President Donald Trump pushed for businesses to reopen despite warnings by public health experts.China had 57 confirmed cases in the 24 hours through midnight Saturday, the National Health Commission reported. That was the highest since mid-April and included 36 in Beijing, the capital.The biggest wholesale food market in Beijing, a city of 20 million residents, was shut down Saturday after 50 people tested positive for the virus. They were the city’s first confirmed cases in 50 days.The world is seeing more than 100,000 newly confirmed cases every day, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.China, where the pandemic began in December, and other countries that suffered early on including South Korea, Italy and Spain have seen numbers of new infections decline. Brazil, India, the United States and other countries are seeing large increases.China responded to the outbreak with the world’s most intensive anti-disease controls, isolating cities with some 60 million people and shutting down much of its economy in steps that later were imitated by some other governments.The ruling Communist party eased most limits on business and travel after declaring victory over the disease in March. Some curbs still are in place including a ban on most foreign travelers arriving in the country.On Saturday, authorities in Beijing locked down 11 residential communities near the Xinfadi market. White fencing sealed off a road leading to apartment buildings and drivers were required to show identification to enter the area.South Korea’s government reported 34 more coronavirus cases, adding to an upward trend in infections.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 30 of the new cases were in the greater Seoul area, where half of the country’s 51 million people live. New cases have been linked to nightlife establishments, church services, a large-scale e-commerce warehouse and door-to-door sellers.The Egyptian Health Ministry announced 1,677 new confirmed cases. Egypt is the Arab world’s most populous country and has its highest coronavirus death toll. The country has reported 1,484 deaths and 42,980 confirmed cases.In the United States, the number of new cases in the southwestern state of Arizona has risen to more than 1,000 per day from fewer than 400 when the state’s shutdown was lifted in mid-May, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.Gov. Doug Ducey is not requiring Arizona residents to wear masks in public despite warnings by public health experts outside the government.Elsewhere, bar owners in New Orleans were preparing to reopen. San Francisco restaurants resumed outdoor seating Friday and the California government allowed hotels, zoos, museums and aquariums to reopen.The states of Utah and Oregon suspended further reopening of their economies due to a spike in cases.The latest Chinese cases raised the mainland’s total to 83.132, with 4,634 deaths, according to the Health Commission. South Korea has reported 12,085 cases and 277 deaths.Also Sunday, China’s air regulator announced China Southern Airlines was required to suspend flights between Dhaka, Bangladesh, and the southern city of Guangzhou for four weeks after 17 passengers on Thursday’s flight tested positive for the virus.Beijing allows each airline to make one flight per week on each route. Under rules announced June 4, a route will be suspended for one week if five passengers on a flight test positive and four weeks if the number rises to 10.In Europe, France’s highest administrative court ruled Saturday that virus concerns no longer justify banning public protests.The Council of State’s decision allows for demonstrations and marches as long as health protections are respected. Events must be declared in advance to local authorities and not deemed a risk to public order.The ruling came as an unauthorized protest against police violence and racial injustice wound down in Paris. Police had stopped at least 15,000 protesters from a planned march through the city Saturday, citing virus-related restrictions on any gathering of more than 10 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-korea-egypt-record-rise-in-covid-cases-as-curbs-on-business-travel-ease/story-c2t1TDWFjZXkSiHEOADqNP.html
14-06-2020||World||Republican congressman who officiated gay wedding loses primary||A freshman Virginia GOP congressman who angered social conservatives in his district when he officiated a gay wedding lost his party’s nomination.US Rep. Denver Riggleman lost a GOP convention Saturday that was done via drive-thru because of the coronavirus pandemic. He was defeated by Bob Good, a former official in the athletics department at Liberty University.While the convention ended at 7 p.m., the vote tally was not announced until after 1 a.m. Sunday. Good said he won 58% of the vote, news outlets reported, and 5th District Republican Committee Chair Melvin Adams said 2,537 of the more than 3,500 registered delegates voted.Riggleman, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, upset many Republicans in his district last summer when he officiated the wedding of two male campaign aides.The convention was held at a Lynchburg-area church near Good’s home and was the only place delegates could cast a ballot in a district that stretches from northern Virginia to the North Carolina border.Riggleman has said a small coterie of Republican insiders were trying to rig the contest against him forcing the nomination process to be decided with a convention instead of a primary. Conventions favor more conservative candidates and have been used for years by Virginia Republicans to block moderate Republicans from winning office.“Voting irregularities and ballot stuffing has been reported in multiple counties in the #VA05. Voter fraud has been a hallmark of this nomination process and I will not stand for it,” Riggleman tweeted a little over an hour before results were announced. “@VA_GOP needs to reevaluate their priorities. We are evaluating all our options at this time.”President Donald Trump endorsed Riggleman, as did Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr.Good is now the Republican nominee for Virginia’s 5th Congressional District. Four Democrats are vying to challenge him in the fall, with the winner picked later this summer.“That’s what losers say,” Good told reporters, commenting on Riggleman’s allegations of irregularities.Good has pledged to restore “Judeo-Christian” values to Congress. He’s also a hardliner on immigration and wants English to be the official language of the US. His victory could make national Democrats and outside groups more likely to spend money in the district, which easily went for Trump in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republican-congressman-who-officiated-gay-wedding-loses-primary/story-LuFa0BsFHgg2AtZasPgdIN.html

14-06-2020||World||Australia’s largest states further ease coronavirus curbs||Australia’s two largest states will further ease public coronavirus restrictions at libraries, community centres and nightclubs, officials said on Sunday, despite recording increases in new infections.New South Wales (NSW), the most populous state, said that from July 1, a 50 person limit on indoor venues such as restaurants and churches would be scrapped, so long as the venues observed a one person per four square metre rule.Nightclubs and music festivals would also be allowed to operate from August if new cases remain low, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said. The state on Saturday reported the first locally transmitted Covid-19 case in weeks, and state officials on Sunday said there had been nine new infections since late Friday.In neighboring Victoria, where pubs and other venues are currently limited to 20 people, indoor businesses will be allowed to have up to 50 seated patrons from June 22, said state premier Daniel Andrews.All sports for children would resume, he said. Indoor sports centres and physical recreation spaces like gyms will be allowed to host 20 people, with caps of up to 10 adults per group, he added.Strict lockdown restrictions and the closure of state and national borders have allowed Australia to curb the spread of the coronavirus, with many parts of the country claiming to have eliminated the disease.With only 102 deaths, much lower than most other developed nations, the federal government has stepped up pressure on state and territory leaders to reopen internal borders, a step viewed as key to reviving the country’s economy.“We would love to open everything tomorrow. We can’t do that. Because if we did we would be almost making it certain that we would have a second wave,” Andrews told reporters in Melbourne.“They are happening in many countries around the world and it’s just not my practice to follow models that are proven by others not to work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-largest-states-further-ease-coronavirus-curbs/story-lA0CSNRvy3ZW4tRVD5LHiL.html
14-06-2020||World||India, with 12 nations, leads initiative at UN to counter misinformation on Covid-19||India, along with 12 other countries, has led an initiative here aimed at spreading fact-based content to counter misinformation on the coronavirus, with over 130 nations endorsing the global call to fight the “infodemic” relating to the Covid-19 pandemic. On the initiative by Australia, Chile, France, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Latvia, Lebanon, Mauritius, Mexico, Norway, Senegal and South Africa, a total of 132 member states endorsed a cross-regional statement on “infodemic” or manipulated information. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said that apart from fighting the deadly Covid-19 pandemic, the world is also seeing a “dangerous outbreak” of misinformation about harmful health advice, hate speech and wild conspiracy theories and antidote to this pandemic of misinformation is fact-based news and analysis. India’s Permanent Mission to the UN said that it supported the UN Communications Response initiative ‘#VERIFIED’ and “calls for global action to fight infodemic in times of Covid-19.” Last month, the United Nations launched ‘Verified’, an initiative to combat the growing scourge of Covid-19 misinformation by increasing the volume and reach of trusted, accurate information. The 13 nations co-authored the cross-regional statement, which said that in times of the Covid-19 health crisis, “the spread of the ‘infodemic’ can be as dangerous to human health and security as the pandemic itself. Among other negative consequences, Covid-19 has created conditions that enable the spread of disinformation, fake news and doctored videos to foment violence and divide communities.” “It is critical that states counter misinformation as a toxic driver of secondary impacts of the pandemic that can heighten the risk of conflict, violence, human rights violations and mass atrocities,” the cross-regional statement said. The 13 nations called on everybody to immediately cease spreading misinformation and to observe UN recommendations to tackle this issue. “The Covid-19 crisis has demonstrated the crucial need for access to free, reliable, trustworthy, factual, multilingual, targeted, accurate, clear and science-based information, as well as for ensuring dialogue and participation of all stakeholders and affected communities during the preparedness, readiness and response,” they said. The nations said that they along with other many countries and international institutions, such as the WHO and UNESCO, have worked towards increasing societal resilience against disinformation, which has improved overall preparedness to deal with and better comprehend both the “infodemic” and the Covid-19 pandemic. “We are also concerned about the damage caused by the deliberate creation and circulation of false or manipulated information relating to the pandemic,” the statement said. “We call on countries to take steps to counter the spread of such disinformation, in an objective manner and with due respect for citizens’ freedom of expression, as well as public order and safety. We reaffirm the importance of ensuring that people are accurately informed from trustworthy sources and are not misled by disinformation about Covid-19,” it said. The statement called for action by all Member States and stakeholders to fight the “infodemic” to build what the Secretary General has described a “healthier, more equitable, just and resilient world”. “We cannot cede our virtual spaces to those who traffic in lies, fear and hate,” Guterres had said announcing the initiative. “Misinformation spreads online, in messaging apps and person to person. Its creators use savvy production and distribution methods. To counter it, scientists and institutions like the United Nations need to reach people with accurate information they can trust,” he said. ‘Verified’, led by the UN Department for Global Communications (DGC), will provide information around three themes: science – to save lives; solidarity – to promote local and global cooperation; and solutions – to advocate for support to impacted populations. It will also promote recovery packages that tackle the climate crisis and address the root causes of poverty, inequality and hunger. The initiative is calling on people around the world to sign up to become “information volunteers” to share trusted content to keep their families and communities safe and connected. Described as digital first responders, the volunteers will receive a daily feed of verified content optimised for social sharing with simple, compelling messaging that either directly counters misinformation or fills an information void. “In many countries the misinformation surging across digital channels is impeding the public health response and stirring unrest. There are disturbing efforts to exploit the crisis to advance nativism or to target minority groups, which could worsen as the strain on societies grows and the economic and social fallout kicks in,” UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications Melissa Fleming said. “The Verified initiative will also work to address this trend with hopeful content that celebrates local acts of humanity, the contributions of refugees and migrants, and makes the case for global cooperation,” Fleming said. The initiative is a collaboration with Purpose, one of the world’s leading social mobilisation organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-with-12-nations-leads-initiative-at-un-to-counter-misinformation-on-covid-19/story-hhlIgvkfRAbmsCQkQgqyvK.html

For companies who consider themselves diverse, hold that statement up against your board and your executive team – how many Blacks do you see?”Joining him are co-chairs Prem Watsa, chairman of Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited; Victor Dodig, president of the bank CIBC; and Rola Dagher, president and CEO of Cisco Systems Canada.In supporting the initiative that comes as a new conversation has started worldwide over racism after the killing by police of African-American George Floyd in Minneapolis last month, Watsa said, “The time for passing the buck is over. As business leaders in Canada, we have a responsibility to not only recognize that anti-Black systemic racism exists in this country but also take meaningful steps to end it.” Watsa, sometimes described as the Warren Buffet of Canada, is also the founder of the Invest India Conference.The Council has invited leaders of top 250 companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, over 100 of the biggest private businesses in Canada, major banks, insurance companies, international companies that have a significant presence in Canada, and the largest asset managers and institutional investors in the nation, to join the inaugural summit scheduled for July 20.Participants will be asked to sign a CEO Pledge, and outline what their plan will be to remove anti-black bias in their businesses. In its statement, the Council said, “Corporate Canada was bold enough to take up the challenge to add gender diversity to Canadian boardrooms and executive suites by declaring policies, setting specific targets, and holding itself accountable and is now well on the way to reforming the system. Now it is time to do the same thing for Blacks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-business-leaders-come-together-to-challenge-systemic-racism/story-EO3Hurykt0K2mrwfiigGIP.html

The incident was caught on camera.Images on local television showed the restaurant in flames, with no fire crews on the scene. Other demonstrators marched onto Interstate-75, where they were met by police.Brooks was the father of a young daughter who was celebrating her birthday on Saturday, his lawyers said. His death from a police bullet came after more than two weeks of demonstrations in major cities across the United States in the name of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died on May 25 under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer.Police were called to the Wendy’s over reports that Brooks had fallen asleep in the drive-thru line. Officers attempted to take him into custody after he failed a field sobriety test, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.Video shot by a bystander captures Brooks struggling with two officers on the ground outside the Wendy’s before breaking free and running across the parking lot with what appears to be a police TASER in his hand.Anti-racism protesters on Saturday sought to call attention to the death of another black man - who was found hanging from a tree in California.Hundreds of people marched in Palmdale to demand an investigation into the death of Robert Fuller, 24. They marched from where the body was found to a sheriff’s station, with many carrying signs that said “Justice for Robert Fuller”.Authorities said the death appeared to be a suicide, but an autopsy was planned. The city said there were no outdoor cameras that could have recorded what happened.The Atlanta police chief, meanwhile, resigned on Saturday over the incident outside Wendy’s. By Saturday evening, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced that she had accepted the resignation of Police Chief Erika Shields.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rayshard-brooks-shooting-protesters-set-wendy-s-restaurant-on-fire/story-7mr5sSxQNibqT4tESQgVEO.html

The spike was recorded in the last 24 hours, between Friday and Saturday.The 36 new cases are the highest 24-hour jump for the capital since January when the health authorities started to release coronavirus data.Beijing had reported six new domestic cases for Friday, and one for Thursday, leading local authorities to swing back into anti-epidemic mode on a “wartime” footing.The capital, a city of around 21 million residents, had lowered its anti-outbreak emergency mode to the lowest level earlier this month.Two more domestic cases were reported from northeast China’s Liaoning province, the National Health Commission (NHC) said in its daily briefing on Sunday.Nineteen of 57 cases were imported cases, the NHC said with 17 of them reported in the southern province of Guangdong.The virus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late last year before spreading to the rest of the country, and then rapidly across the world.Beijing has now reported 43 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in about three days, triggering alarm bells about the second wave of the epidemic just when the city was getting back to full normalisation, which included the reopening of schools after being shut for months.Sporting activities have been suspended and tourist spots, which had only lately opened up fully, were shut down as well over the weekend.Thousands of workers and residents around the Xinfadi market in Beijing’s Fengtai district were lining up for nucleic acid tests on Sunday.Besides shuttering the market, where coronavirus traces were discovered in imported salmon, authorities have launched closed-off management over 11 residential compounds in the vicinity of the Xinfadi market.The city has suspended a major wholesale food and vegetable market and strengthened control measures to contain the spread of the epidemic.The total number of Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 83,132 while the death toll has remained unchanged at 4,634 for weeks.By Saturday, the Chinese mainland had reported a total of 1,827 imported cases. Of the cases, 1,744 had been discharged from hospitals after recovery, and 83 remained hospitalised, with no one in severe condition. No deaths from the imported cases had been reported, official news agency, Xinhua reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-36-beijing-see-highest-daily-jump-in-covid-19-cases-since-outbreak-began/story-zO3eVKOC3noN36TbiptrQP.html

That was the highest daily toll since mid-April and included 36 in Beijing, the capital.The new cases illustrated how the virus can come back as anti-disease controls are relaxed.The Xinfadi market on Beijing’s southeastern side was closed Saturday and neighboring residential compounds locked down after more then 50 people in the capital tested positive for the coronavirus. They were the first confirmed cases in 50 days in the city of 20 million people.China, where the pandemic began in December, had relaxed most of its anti-virus controls after the ruling Communist Party declared victory over the disease in March.Authorities locked down 11 residential communities near the Xinfadi market. Police installed white fencing to seal off a road leading to a cluster of apartment buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-57-new-covid-19-cases-highest-daily-number-in-2-months/story-sunQ4ddDNoW6GPGjEiPuVM.html

During protests, far-right demonstrators also emerged in large groups for the first time -- particularly in London -- leading to sometimes violent confrontations that included attacks on police officers.UK Home Secretary Priti Patel urged citizens not to protest Saturday because of the ongoing coronavirus threat.“Well, I think it’s just stating the facts. We are in a health emergency right now. I think the fact that we have made this clear in terms of ‘people should not gather’, ‘they should not protest’, the police are saying this every single day as well, really speaks to a very real public health message that we are restating to the British public,” she said.Black Lives Matter protestors emerged worldwide following the death of African American man George Floyd in police custody in the US.The worldwide spread of anti-racist protests following the death of George Floyd has led to calls to defund police departments and take down Confederate statues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-protests-over-100-arrested-in-london/story-0MaHkgYdL8TmuXUXdv2N2N.html
14-06-2020||World||Hong Kong’s rich are preparing for a worst-case scenario||One Hong Kong businessman moved $10 million to Singapore and plans to transfer more. Another is eyeing London property, worried that prices in Hong Kong are too high. Well-to-do families across the city are opening offshore bank accounts and applying for alternative passports.While it doesn’t add up to an exodus just yet, Hong Kong’s rich are increasingly hedging their bets as the financial hub suffers its worst economic and political crises since at least 1997.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageMany high-net-worth investors are either reducing their Hong Kong exposure or taking steps to ensure they can withdraw assets at a moment’s notice, underscoring the challenge for Chief Executive Carrie Lam as she tries to maintain the city’s status as magnet for Asian wealth. Rich individuals are major players in Hong Kong’s equity and real-estate markets as well as big buyers of Chinese corporate bonds issued in the city.Private bankers say their clients accelerated contingency planning efforts after China announced last month it would impose controversial national security laws on Hong Kong. The legislation threatens to erode the former British colony’s judicial independence, provoke sanctions from the US and revive street protests that battered the tourism and retail industries even before the coronavirus outbreak plunged the economy into its deepest recession on record.“What we’re basically seeing is a bit like a slow-moving train wreck,” said Richard Harris, chief executive of Port Shelter Investment Management in Hong Kong. “People who haven’t moved their money out may be tempted to think: ‘Well, maybe I should be moving my money out.’ That process is likely to continue.”To be sure, there’s little evidence so far of widespread capital flight.Hong Kong bank deposits increased to a record in April and the city’s currency has continued to trade at the strong end of its permitted band against the dollar. Hong Kong’s wealthiest billionaires have publicly endorsed the proposed security laws and expressed confidence in the city’s future.In private, however, many Hong Kong entrepreneurs and high-earning professionals are sounding a more pessimistic note.Cheng, the businessman who moved $10 million to Singapore, also secured his permanent resident status in the city-state this year and has been selling his Hong Kong properties. He has no concrete plans to emigrate yet, but is considering his options. He and his family have passports from the US, Canada, Australia and France.Cheng, who was born in Hong Kong, said he worries about China’s tightening grip on the city and the prospect for more unrest. Like several of the people quoted in this story, he asked not to reveal his full name because of the political sensitivity of the subject.Sam, a senior investment banker in Hong Kong, has decided to leave the city. The 43-year-old is emigrating to Australia with his wife and two young boys in about three months, the second time he will have left Hong Kong during a period of political turmoil. Sam grew up in the city, but moved to Brisbane when he was 12 after his parents got spooked by China’s crackdown on protesters in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1989. He came back to Hong Kong 20 years ago for his career but now sees no upside to staying.“Things are looking bad and deteriorating,” he said. “We may as well pack our bags and move to Australia so that the kids can have a better environment growing up.”Margaret Chau, a Hong Kong-based immigration program director for Goldmax Immigration Consulting Co., said inquiries at her firm have jumped about five-fold after news of the national security legislation. For now, most of her wealthy customers are more interested setting up an escape route than leaving right away.“They see this as a backup plan,” Chau said.Kerry Goh, chief executive officer of multi-family office Kamet Capital in Singapore, said his clients have shifted from asking generic questions about moving out of Hong Kong to making detailed inquiries about everything from schools to visas and bank accounts.“What’s happened in Hong Kong has really sped up the timing of 2047,” Goh said, referring to the expiration date of China’s 50-year pledge to preserve Hong Kong’s autonomy after the handover from Britain. “As Hong Kong’s troubles shoot up, the benefits of Singapore have become more self-explanatory.”Other more far-flung locales are also attracting increased interest from investors in Hong Kong. Puerto Rico’s Standard International Bank, a so-called International Financial Entity that expanded its footprint in Asia last year, has seen its deposits more than triple since December 2019, according to general manager Maria Diaz. “Turbulence in Hong Kong has changed the landscape,” she said.Dennis, a 34-year-old executive at a Hong Kong-based consulting firm founded by his parents, said his family and many of their friends have started moving cash out of the city. He’s looking to buy more properties in the U.K., where he spent almost a decade attending boarding school and university.“I could buy a much bigger flat in London, so why not?” he said. “I’m just trying to protect my money against any uncertainty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-rich-are-preparing-for-a-worst-case-scenario/story-Fa7pvOwIKtfE6gdzhEQ99L.html
14-06-2020||World||Terrorists kill 20 soldiers, 40 civilians in northeast Nigeria attacks||Islamic terrorists killed at least 20 soldiers and more than 40 civilians and injured hundreds in twin attacks in northeast Nigeria’s Borno state on Saturday, residents and a civilian task force fighter said.The attacks, in the Monguno and Nganzai local government areas, came just days after terrorists killed at least 69 people in a raid on a village in a third area, Gubio.Two humanitarian workers and three residents told Reuters that terrorists armed with heavy weaponry including rocket launchers arrived in Monguno, a hub for international non-governmental organizations, at roughly 11 a.m. local time. They overran government forces, taking some casualties but killing at least 20 soldiers and roaming the area for three hours.The sources said hundreds of civilians were injured in the crossfire, overwhelming the local hospital and forcing some of the injured to lay outside the facility awaiting help.The sources said the terrorists also set fire to the local police station and burned down the United Nations’ humanitarian hub in the area, although a UN spokesperson said the facility sustained only light damage. Fighters distributed letters to residents, in the local Hausa language, warning them not to work with the military, white Christian westerners or other “non-believers”.terrorists also entered Nganzai at about the same time on Saturday, according to two residents and one Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) fighter. They arrived on motorcycles and in pickup trucks and killed more than 40 residents, the sources said.A military spokesman did not answer calls for comment on the attacks. U.N. officials could not immediately be reached for comment.Boko Haram and its offshoot, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), have killed thousands and displaced millions in northeastern Nigeria. ISWAP claimed the two Saturday attacks, and the Gubio attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/terrorists-kill-20-soldiers-40-civilians-in-northeast-nigeria-attacks/story-NqJZJUaAZZLQpZHlEitCQJ.html
14-06-2020||World||Bars reopening in New Orleans. Will tourists come?||Bar owners in New Orleans prepared for a soft opening, and an uncertain one, as they began letting customers in Saturday for the first time in months. Capacity is limited to 25 percent, live music remains prohibited, and nobody knows how many tourists will show on Bourbon Street in the age of Covid-19.Pam Fortner, owner of six French Quarter venues, is opening only two of them, both on Bourbon, where the customary blocks-long frat party atmosphere ended in an abrupt shutdown in mid-March.Now, she’s not sure what to expect. She sat at a sidewalk table at Royal and St. Ann on Thursday, eating a Caesar salad and deriving hope from the occasional out-of-state license plate she saw amid sparse traffic.“I think Saturday will be busy,” she said in an interview.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageCherie Boos, manager of Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop, in an authentically rustic, creaky floored 18th-century Creole cottage, said she’s hoping locals will help keep the bar financially afloat as Bourbon Street revives. But she adds, “We’re hoping that, you know, we can start generating some tourists in the city, too, now that the bars are going to be open.”Bourbon Street, which had the ambiance of an empty movie set in April, has experienced a slow re-awakening in recent weeks. Dine-in restaurants have been allowed to reopen at 25% capacity, as have bars with food permits. Still, traffic has been slow and plywood covered numerous tavern windows until Mayor LaToya Cantrell announced the latest easing of restrictions in a city that, in the spring, had become an international hot spot for Covid-19.Even as they announced the reopenings on Tuesday, city officials admitted they were concerned about a possible recurrence.“Oh, I’m worried. I am worried,” Cantrell said at a news conference. She said city code enforcement officials will watch to make sure social distancing, masking requirements and building capacity limits are enforced.Customers will have to be mindful, too, said Dr. Jennifer Avegno, the city’s health director. “If you’re there, with your household group and you’re having drinks at a table at a bar, we really need you not to go off and mingle with the other tables,” she said Tuesday.Toward that end, there will be no musicians on stage at Fortner’s Tropical Isle bars on Bourbon Street. That prevents people from congregating near the stage and eliminates the possibility that a singer belting out a song could also be unknowingly spreading the virus. That fear that has kept the city from allowing live music performances, including choirs in churches.Some New Orleans bar owners are critical of the restrictions. “Why are they picking on the musicians?” said Fortner.And some bars, like the Maple Leaf, a venerable late night haunt in the Carrollton neighborhood, decided not to open.‘While our City leaders have decided to allow bars to reopen ... we will not be allowed to have Live Music and what is the Leaf without our musicians?” read a post on the Maple Leaf’s Facebook page.One of the quarter’s best known tourist spots, Pat O’Brien’s, also didn’t plan an immediate reopening. Manager Shelley Waguespack has numerous concerns as she decides when and how to reopen.She’s hoping the state Legislature will address one concern — liability. She said she worries about getting sued if someone who visits the bar later comes down with Covid-19.She’s also unhappy about the limits on live music.“We wanted to put a piano player on the patio,” Waguespack said. “We thought that would have been lovely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bars-reopening-in-new-orleans-will-tourists-come/story-z1X8oxxs8edLSg2tA4njbJ.html
14-06-2020||World||Atlanta police chief resigns after fatal police shooting of Rayshard Brooks||Atlanta’s police chief resigned Saturday hours after a black man was fatally shot by officers in a struggle following a field sobriety test. Authorities said the slain man had grabbed an officer’s Taser, but was running away when he was shot.Police Chief Erika Shields stepped down as the killing of 27-year-old Rayshard Brooks sparked a new wave of protests in Atlanta after turbulent demonstrations that followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis had simmered down.Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the police chief’s resignation at a Saturday news conference as roughly 150 people marched outside the Wendy’s restaurant where Brooks was fatally shot late Friday. The mayor also called for the immediate firing of the unidentified officer who opened fire at Brooks.“I do not believe that this was a justified use of deadly force and have called for the immediate termination of the officer,” Bottoms said.She said it was Shields’ own decision to step aside as police chief and that she would remain with the city in an undetermined role. Interim Corrections Chief Rodney Bryant would serve as interim police chief until a permanent replacement is found.The Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the shooting, said the deadly confrontation started with officers responding to a complaint that a man was sleeping in a car blocking the restaurant’s drive-thru lane. The GBI said Brooks failed a field sobriety test and then resisted officers’ attempts to arrest him.The GBI released security camera video of the shooting Saturday. The footage shows a man running from two police officers as he raises a hand, which is holding some type of object, toward an officer a few steps behind him. The officer draws his gun and fires as the man keeps running, then falls to the ground in the parking lot.GBI Director Vic Reynolds said Brooks had grabbed a Taser from one of the officers and appeared to point it at the officer as he fled, prompting the officer to reach for his gun.“In a circumstance like this where an officer is involved in the use of deadly force, the public has a right to know what happened,” GBI Director Vic Reynolds told a news conference on a day when protesters gathered at the scene of the shooting and in other areas of Atlanta.The security camera video does not show Brooks’ initial struggle with police.The shooting came at a time of heightened tension over police brutality and calls for reforms across the US following the May 25 death of Floyd in Minneapolis. Atlanta was among US cities where large crowds of protesters took to the streets.Demonstrators including members of Brooks’ family gathered Saturday outside the restaurant where he was shot. Police shut down streets for several blocks around the restaurant as protesters marched peacefully in the streets. There was a short, tense standoff with Georgia state troopers who lined up to block protesters as they tried to march onto a nearby interstate highway. The demonstrators eventually turned away.Among those protesting was Crystal Brooks, who said she is Rayshard Brooks’ sister-in-law.“He wasn’t causing anyone any harm,” she said. “The police went up to the car and even though the car was parked they pulled him out of the car and started tussling with him.”She added: “He did grab the Taser, but he just grabbed the Taser and ran.”Shields, Atlanta’s police chief for less than four years, was initially praised in the days following Floyd’s death last month. She said the Minnesota officers involved should go to prison and walked into crowds of protesters in downtown Atlanta, telling demonstrators she understood their frustrations and fears. She appeared at Bottoms’ side as the mayor made an impassioned plea for protesters to go home when things turned violent with smashed storefronts and police cruisers set ablaze.Days later, Shields fired two officers and benched three others caught on video May 30 in a hostile confrontation with two college students whose car was stuck in traffic caused by the protests. The officers shouted at the pair, fired Tasers at them and dragged them from the vehicle. When prosecutors charged six officers with crimes in the incident, however, Shields openly questioned the timing and appropriateness of the charges.The shooting of Brooks two weeks later raised further questions about the Atlanta department. In a statement, Shields said she chose to resign “out of a deep and abiding love for this city and this department.”“It is time for the city to move forward and build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve,” Shields said.Reynolds said his agents worked through the night interviewing witnesses and reviewing video. He said their findings show that Brooks tried to fight off two officers when they tried to arrest him and at one point managed to take a Taser away from one of them.A security camera recorded Brooks “running or fleeing from Atlanta police officers,” Reynolds said. “It appears that he has in his hand a Taser.”During a short foot chase Brooks “turns around and it appears at that time he points a Taser at an Atlanta officer,” Reynolds said. That’s when the officer drew his gun and shot Brooks, he said, estimating the officer fired three times.Reynolds said his agents will turn over results of their investigation to Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard, whose office will decide whether criminal charges are warranted against either of the officers.Howard said Saturday his office “has already launched an intense, independent investigation of the incident” without waiting for the GBI’s results.The officers involved in the shooting were not identified.Brooks died after being taken to an Atlanta hospital. One of the officers was treated and released for unspecified injuries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/atlanta-police-chief-resigns-after-fatal-police-shooting/story-rMO7K6XbKdjIQTMxZUiDvI.html
14-06-2020||World||Trump calls out ‘evil of slavery’ at West Point graduation ceremony speech||As the nation continues to grapple with its racial past, President Donald Trump urged West Point’s graduating class Saturday to “never forget” the legacy of soldiers before them who fought a bloody war to “extinguish the evil of slavery.”Trump’s appeal to remember history came as his own relationship with the military is under strain from the unrelenting criticism he and Pentagon leaders have faced over their response to protests that erupted after George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis.It also came hours after Trump made what amounted to a rare concession for him: He rescheduled a campaign rally planned for Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 19. The day marks the end of slavery in the US, and Tulsa was the scene of a fiery white-on-black attack in 1921.“What has historically made America unique is the durability of its institutions against the passions and prejudices of the moment,” Trump told more than 1,100 graduates at an unusual outdoor ceremony held during a pandemic. “When times are turbulent, when the road is rough, what matters most is that which is permanent, timeless, enduring and eternal.”In the past two weeks, Trump has yelled at Defense Secretary Mark Esper for publicly opposing his call to deploy active-duty troops to quell the protests stemming from the killing of Floyd, who was black, by a white Minneapolis police officer.Trump also shut down Esper’s attempt to begin a public debate on removing the names of Confederate Army officers — some of whom trained at West Point — from military bases, an idea gaining momentum across the country.Gen. Mark Milley, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, risked Trump’s ire Thursday by declaring he had made “a mistake” by accompanying Trump on a June 1 walk through Lafayette Square. It ended with the president posing with a Bible outside a boarded-up St. John’s Church.Milley’s comments amounted to an extraordinary expression of regret by Trump’s chief military adviser, who said his appearance led to the perception of the military becoming embroiled in politics, which in his view — one shared by Esper — is a threat to democracy.The events have stirred debate within the military and among retired officers. More than 500 West Point graduates from classes spanning six decades signed an open letter reminding the Class of 2020 of its commitment to avoid partisan politics.The letter, published this week on Medium, also alluded to the problems Esper and Milley encountered at the White House after Floyd’s death.“Sadly, the government has threatened to use the Army in which you serve as a weapon against fellow Americans engaging in these legitimate protests,” they wrote. “Worse, military leaders, who took the same oath you take today, have participated in politically charged events. The principle of civilian control is central to the military profession. But that principle does not imply blind obedience.”During the commencement ceremony, protesters denounced the president from boats and kayaks along the nearby Hudson River.Trump also used his first West Point address to remind the newly commissioned officers of the academy’s history and storied generals like Douglas MacArthur and Dwight D. Eisenhower.“It was on this soil that American patriots held the most vital fortress in our war for independence,” Trump said. He said the US Military Academy “gave us the men and women who fought and won a bloody war to extinguish the evil of slavery within one lifetime of our founding.’’“This is your history. This is the legacy that each of you inherits,” Trump continued, adding that it was bought with American blood spilled in battle. “You must never forget it.”Trump, however, was incorrect to say women had been trained at West Point for the anti-slavery fight; they were not allowed to become cadets until 1976.His remarks also overlooked numerous West Point graduates who served in the Confederacy, including President Jefferson Davis, Gen. Robert E. Lee and Gen. Braxton Bragg. Some are now seeking the removal of Bragg’s name from North Carolina’s Fort Bragg.In the speech, Trump leaned into his “America first” brand of foreign policy without uttering the phrase, telling the Army’s newest officers their job is “not to rebuild foreign nations, but to defend and defend strongly our nation from our foreign enemies.”“It is not the duty of US troops to solve ancient conflicts in faraway lands that many people have never heard of.” He said America is not the “policeman of the world,” but warned adversaries that it will “never, ever hesitate” to act when its people are threatened.He thanked those in the military who helped the country respond to the coronavirus, once again calling it an “invisible enemy” from China.The president stressed the unity of a graduating class that came “from every race, religion, color and creed.” The class also includes citizens of 11 other countries, including Bosnia-Herzegovina, South Korea and Tanzania.Trump highlighted bigger defense budgets under his watch but falsely said he had destroyed 100% of the Islamic State caliphate in the Middle East; the group still poses a threat to the US He noted he had directed the killing of two terrorist leaders and had created the Space Force.Trump also remembered a cadet who died in an accident last year and whose father is a Secret Service agent, and noted that both he and the Army share a birthday Sunday. Trump will turn 74, while the Army marks its 254th year of existence.Esper did not attend, but emphasized the principles of duty, honor and country in a video message, saying they will help guide the new officers “in challenging times and in the face of new and emerging threats.”Trump’s appearance at West Point had been criticized as a political move that would put the graduates at risk since the academy is located up the Hudson River from New York City, the epicenter of the US coronavirus outbreak.The Army defended the move, saying the cadets had to return to campus anyway for final medical checks, equipment and training. They had been home since spring break in early March..For the ceremony, the newly commissioned second lieutenants wore face masks as they marched onto the parade field, but removed them after sitting for the socially distant ceremony required by the pandemic.Instead of shaking hands with the president, they exchanged salutes. Family and friends were not allowed to attend and had to watch online.At the end of the ceremony, five hulking helicopters flew low and slow over the field as the graduates tossed their white dress caps into the air.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-calls-out-evil-of-slavery-at-west-point-graduation-ceremony-speech/story-p3OKzQMvuhjOaetbLLg4fJ.html
14-06-2020||World||Atlanta police shoot, kill black man who grabbed a Taser||A black man killed by Atlanta police in a struggle following a field sobriety test was shot after he snatched an officer’s Taser and pointed it back at the officer while fleeing, the head of the Georgia agency investigating the case said Saturday.Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vic Reynolds said the Friday night shooting outside a Wendy’s restaurant was captured by a security camera as well as by witnesses’ cellphones. Reynolds said the GBI would share the security camera footage with the public later Saturday.“In a circumstance like this where an officer is involved in the use of deadly force, the public has a right to know what happened,” Reynolds told a news conference on a day when protesters gathered at the scene of the shooting and in other areas of Atlanta.Atlanta police were called to the restaurant on a complaint that a man was sleeping in a car blocking the drive-thru lane as customers waited in line, the GBI said. The agency identified the man who was fatally shot as 27-year-old Rayshard Brooks.The shooting came at a time of heightened tension over police brutality and calls for reforms across the US following the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Atlanta was among US cities where large crowds of protesters took to the streets.A crowd of demonstrators gathered Saturday outside the Atlanta restaurant where Brooks was shot. Gerald Griggs, an attorney and a vice president of Atlanta’s NAACP chapter, estimated there were 150 people protesting at the scene as he walked with them Saturday afternoon.“The people are upset,” Griggs said. “They want to know why their dear brother Rayshard Brooks was shot and killed when he was merely asleep on the passenger side and not doing anything.” Even though Brooks struggled with officers, Griggs said, “they could have used nonlethal force to take him down.” Reynolds said his agents worked through the night interviewing witnesses and reviewing video. He said their findings show that Brooks tried to fight off two officers when they tried to arrest him and at one point managed to take a Taser away from one of them.A security camera recorded Brooks “running or fleeing from Atlanta police officers,” Reynolds said. “It appears that he has in his hand a Taser.” During a short foot chase Brooks “turns around and it appears at that time he points a Taser at an Atlanta officer,” Reynolds said. That’s when the officer drew his gun and shot Brooks, he said, estimating the officer fired three times.Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Timothy Peek told reporters late Friday that both officers deployed their Tasers in an attempt to subdue the suspect but were unable to “stop the aggression of the fight.” Reynolds said his agents will turn over results of their investigation to Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard, whose office will decide whether criminal charges are warranted against either of the officers.Howard said Saturday his office had already gotten involved.“My office has already launched an intense, independent investigation of the incident,” Howard said in a statement, saying members of his staff “were on scene shortly after the shooting, and we have been in investigative sessions ever since to identify all of the facts and circumstances surrounding this incident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/atlanta-police-shoot-kill-black-man-who-grabbed-a-taser/story-9RAtOMVBOfXi2DUgBcS9RJ.html
14-06-2020||World||Global recoveries from Covid-19 cross 4 million||Worldwide, more than 4 million people - or 51% of those infected with Covid-19 - have recovered from the deadly infection that emerged at a market in central China late last year and has shown little sign of abating, affecting more than 7.7 million people globally. With this, the number of recoveries far exceeds the number of active coronavirus cases, offering a glimmer of hope even as the Covid-19 pandemic appears to be accelerating in its third major surge of infections. The total number of fatalities recorded from the disease world over stood at nearly 430,000. The US is the worst-hit country with 2.1 million infections and almost 120,000 deaths.  In Brazil, which is the second worst-affected nation after the US, with over 831,000 cases and nearly 42,000 deaths, the city of Sao Paulo has an unorthodox plan to free up space at its graveyards as the crisis there deepens: digging up the bones of people buried in the past and storing their bagged remains in large metal containers.Sao Paulo’s municipal funeral service said on Friday that the remains of people who died at least three years ago will be exhumed and put in numbered bags, then stored temporarily in 12 storage containers it has purchased. Sao Paulo is one of the Covid-19 hotspots in Latin America’s hardest-hit nation, with 5,480 deaths as of Thursday in the city of 12 million people. Health experts are worried about a new surge now that a decline in intensive care bed occupancy to about 70% prompted mayor Bruno Covas to authorise a partial reopening of business this week.Health experts say the peak of Brazil’s pandemic will arrive in August, having spread from the big cities where it first appeared in the nation’s interiors.Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) emergencies chief, said on Friday that the situation in Brazil remains “of concern”, although acknowledged that intensive care bed occupancy rates are now below 80% in most areas of the country.At Sao Paulo’s biggest cemetery, Vila Formosa, Adenilson Costa was among workers in blue protective suits digging up old graves on Friday. He said their work has only grown more arduous during the pandemic, and as he removed bones from unearthed coffins, he said he fears what is to come.“With this opening of malls and stores, we get even more worried. We are not in the curve; we are in the peak and people aren’t aware,” Costa said. “This isn’t over. Now is the worrisome moment.” In April, gravediggers at Vila Formosa buried 1,654 people, up more than 500 from the previous month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-recoveries-from-covid-19-cross-4-million/story-LEu7nctYtY9sLImSOldfgP.html
14-06-2020||World||Atlanta police shoot, kill suspect after struggle||A man reported to police for sleeping in a car blocking the drive-thru lane of a fast food restaurant was shot and killed in a late night struggle with Atlanta officers after he failed a field sobriety test and resisted arrest, Georgia authorities said Saturday.The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said it was asked by the Atlanta Police Department to investigate the shooting of 27-year-old Rayshard Brooks, which happened at a Wendy’s restaurant late Friday.The shooting came at a time of heightened tension over police brutality and calls for reforms across the U.S. following the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Atlanta was among U.S. cities where large crowds of protesters took to the streets.A crowd of demonstrators gathered Saturday outside the Atlanta restaurant where Brooks was shot. Gerald Griggs, an attorney and a vice president of Atlanta’s NAACP chapter, estimated there were 150 people protesting at the scene as he walked with them Saturday afternoon.“The people are upset,” Griggs said. “They want to know why their dear brother Rayshard Brooks was shot and killed when he was merely asleep on the passenger side and not doing anything.”Even though Brooks struggled with officers, Griggs said, “they could have used nonlethal force to take him down.”The GBI said its agents were reviewing video taken by witnesses. The agency also posted to Twitter a plea for witnesses to come forward, saying some at the scene “chose not to be interviewed by GBI agents.”Officers were responding to a complaint of a man in a vehicle parked in the drive-thru who was asleep, causing customers to drive around the vehicle.After Brooks failed a field sobriety test, the officers attempted to place him into custody, according to the GBI. But he resisted and a struggle ensued, leading the officer to deploy a Taser.“Ultimately, when the officer used a Taser, it was ineffective for the suspect,” Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Timothy Peek told reporters at the scene Friday night. “It did not stop the aggression of the fight. And so the suspect was able to take the officer’s Taser from him.”Peek said a second officer also attempted to use a Taser on the struggling man, “but it didn’t work against the suspect as well.”The GBI said in statement it was investigating reports “that the male subject was shot by an officer in the struggle over the Taser.”Brooks was transported to a local hospital where he died after surgery, the statement said.One officer was treated for an injury and discharged from the hospital.Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said Saturday his office had already gotten involved without waiting for the GBI to finish its investigation.“My office has already launched an intense, independent investigation of the incident,” Howard said in a statement, saying members of his staff “were on scene shortly after the shooting, and we have been in investigative sessions ever since to identify all of the facts and circumstances surrounding this incident.”Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat who gained national prominence running for governor in 2018, tweeted Saturday of the shooting that “sleeping in a drive-thru must not end in death.”“The killing of #RayshardBrooks in Atlanta last night demands we severely restrict the use of deadly force,” Abrams’ tweet said. “Yes, investigations must be called for — but so too should accountability.”The officers involved in the shooting was not identified. Once its investigation is complete, the case will be turned over to the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office for review.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/atlanta-police-shoot-kill-suspect-after-struggle/story-NabseL7p24G9DPr5Xj3WqM.html
14-06-2020||World||Seattle man beats coronavirus, then gets stunning $1.1 million hospital bill||Seattle resident Michael Flor, known as the longest-hospitalised Covid-19 patient, has now been dubbed a million-dollar baby after he received the enormous bill from the hospital for his battle with coronavirus recently, the Seattle Times reported on Friday.Not only did Flor survive the infection, he ran up a huge tab amounting to nearly $1.1 million-- Rs 8.1411 crore and was saddled with a bill that resembled a book since it ran into an astounding 181 pages. The 70-year-old, hospitalised for the longest time, nearly had a brush with death one night when he was suffering from the deadly pathogen. A night-shift nurse was sympathetic and held a phone to his ear while his wife and children bid him goodbye. But Flor survived. His recovery prompted those around him to call him the miracle child. But there was more in store for Flor as he found out when he got his hospital bill at his home in West Seattle. He says his heart almost failed a second time when he saw the amount that his healthcare sojourn had cost him.The total tab for his bout with the coronavirus was $1.1 million—an estimated Rs 8.1411 crore. The bill also ran into 181 pages.The bill is technically an explanation of charges, and because Flor has insurance he won’t have to pay the majority of it. In fact, because he had Covid-19, and not a different disease, he might not have to pay anything at all.For now though Flor is stunned and his family and friends have been left wondering at the extreme expense and completely bizarre economics of the American healthcare system.The elderly man was hospitalised at the Swedish Medical Center in Issaquah with Covid-19 for 62 days, so he knew the bill would be a lot. He was unconscious for much of his stay there, but once near the beginning of his illness, his wife Elisa Del Rosario remembers him waking up and saying, “You gotta get me out of here, we can’t afford this.”Just the charge for his room in the intensive care unit was billed at $9,736 per day. Due to the contagious nature of the virus, the room was sealed and could only be entered by medical workers wearing plastic suits and headgear. For 42 days he was in this isolation chamber, for a total cost of $408,912.He was also put on a mechanical ventilator for 29 days, with the use of the machine billed at $2,835 per day, for a total of $82,215. About a quarter of the bill is for the expenses incurred on drugs.This list of expenses tells the story of Flor’s battle and the battle waged against the infection for many like him. Not all of whom can afford it.For the two days when his heart, kidneys and lungs were all failing, indicating multiple organ failure—often the case in coronavirus-- and he was closest to death, the bill runs for 20 pages and totals nearly $100,000. The doctors, it seems “were throwing everything at me they could think of,” Flor says.In all, there are nearly 3,000 itemized charges, about 50 per day. Usually hospitals get paid only a portion of the amount they bill, as most have negotiated discounts with insurance companies. The charges don’t include the two weeks of recuperating he did in a rehab facility.Speaking about his feelings, Flor said he was surprised at his own reaction after being handed the hospital bill--which was guilt. The guilt of the survivor.“I feel guilty about surviving,” he says. “There’s a sense of ‘why me?’ Why did I deserve all this? Looking at the incredible cost of it all definitely adds to that survivor’s guilt.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seattle-man-beats-coronavirus-then-gets-stunning-1-1-million-hospital-bill/story-8Uwxs8Ejpg2owtqdekrqEL.html
14-06-2020||World||Kim Jong Un’s sister threatens South Korea with military action||The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened military action against South Korea as she bashed Seoul on Saturday over declining bilateral relations and its inability to stop activists from floating anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border.Describing South Korea as an “enemy,” Kim Yo Jong repeated an earlier threat she had made by saying Seoul will soon witness the collapse of a “useless” inter-Korean liaison office in the border town of Kaesong.Kim, who is first vice department director of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee, said she would leave it to North Korea’s military leaders to carry out the next step of retaliation against the South.“By exercising my power authorized by the supreme leader, our party and the state, I gave an instruction to the arms of the department in charge of the affairs with enemy to decisively carry out the next action,” she said in a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.“If I drop a hint of our next plan the (South Korean) authorities are anxious about, the right to taking the next action against the enemy will be entrusted to the General Staff of our army,” she said. “Our army, too, will determine something for cooling down our people’s resentment and surely carry out it, I believe.”Kim Yo Jong’s harsh rhetoric demonstrates her elevated status in North Korea’s leadership. Already seen as the most powerful woman in the country and her brother’s closest confidant, state media recently confirmed that she is now in charge of relations with South Korea.The liaison office in Kaesong, which has been shut since January due to coronavirus concerns, was set up as a result of one of the main agreements reached in three summits between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in 2018.Moon’s government had lobbied hard to set up nuclear summits between Kim and President Donald Trump, who have met three times since 2018. At the same time, Moon also worked to improve inter-Korean relations.But North Korea in recent months has suspended virtually all cooperation with the South while expressing frustration over the lack of progress in its nuclear negotiations with the Trump administration.The North declared over the past week that it would cut off all government and military communication channels with the South and threatened to abandon key inter-Korean peace agreements reached by their leaders in 2018.They include a military agreement in which the Koreas committed to jointly take steps to reduce conventional military threats, such as establishing border buffers and no-fly zones. They also removed some front-line guard posts and jointly surveyed a waterway near their western border in an unrealized plan to allow freer civilian navigation.In an earlier statement last week, Kim Yo Jong said that the North would scrap the military agreement, “which is hardly of any value,” while calling North Korean defectors who send leaflets from the South “human scum” and “mongrel dogs.”Her statement on Saturday came hours after a senior North Korean Foreign Ministry official said that Seoul should drop “nonsensical” talk about the North’s denuclearization, and that his country would continue to expand its military capabilities to counter what it perceives as threats from the United States.The comments by Kwon Jong Gun, director-general of the ministry’s U.S. affairs department, were in response to South Korea’s Foreign Ministry, which had told reporters that Seoul would continue to work toward improving bilateral relations and reviving nuclear negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington.In response to North Korea’s anger over the leaflets, South Korea’s government has said it would press charges against two defector groups that have been carrying out border protests. The South also said it would push new laws to ban activists from flying the leaflets across the border, but there’s been criticism over whether Moon’s government is sacrificing democratic principles to keep alive his ambitions for inter-Korean engagement.For years, activists have floated huge balloons into North Korea carrying leaflets criticizing Kim Jong Un over his nuclear ambitions and dismal human rights record. The leafleting has sometimes triggered a furious response from North Korea, which bristles at any attempt to undermine its leadership.While Seoul has sometimes sent police officers to block the activists during sensitive times, it had previously resisted North Korea’s calls to fully ban them, saying they were exercising their freedom. Activists have vowed to continue with the balloon launches.“We should not lend an ear to and trust the trite language let out by (the South) for only form’s sake as they always make a fuss belatedly, nor pardon the sins committed by the betrayers and human scum,” Kim Yo Jong said.“Getting stronger day by day are the unanimous voices of all our people demanding for surely settling accounts with the riff-raff who dared hurt the absolute prestige of our supreme leader ... and flied rubbish to the inviolable territory of our side.”Nuclear talks faltered at Kim’s second summit with Trump in Vietnam in February last year after the United States rejected North Korea’s demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.Trump and Kim met for a third time that year in June at the border between North and South Korea and agreed to resume talks. But an October working-level meeting in Sweden broke down over what the North Koreans described as the Americans’ “old stance and attitude.”On the two-year anniversary of the first Kim-Trump meeting, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Son Gwon said Friday that the North would never again gift Trump with high-profile meetings he could boast as foreign policy achievements unless it gets something substantial in return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-sister-threatens-south-korea-with-military-action/story-Fr90NCT23YIY5lnvRFsyOK.html
14-06-2020||World||India had offered dialogue to Nepal on row over map. Why PM Oli ignored it||On Saturday, the lower house of the Nepali Parliament passed the constitutional amendment bill updating the so-called “political map of Nepal”. The “updated map” includes territories that are parts of the Indian states of Uttarakhand and Bihar. The bill will now go through Nepal’s upper house before receiving presidential assent. According to experts, that is a mere formality.In Nepal, a question that continues to be raised among the intelligentsia, public, politicians is why India has been silent on diplomatic dialogue.But first, lets focus on the ongoing political context in NepalA screen shot of public debate within Nepal would reveal a widespread belief that the constitutional amendment was being used by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to hold on to his position within the Nepal Communist Party, which was highly shaky in early May when pressure on him to vacate the Prime Minister’s post had become unbearable.Also Read: Nepal parliament clears new map, shuts possibility of talks on boundary rowThere were saner voices in Kathmandu that advised him not to bring the constitutional amendment. On the contrary, PM Oli was told, that the constitution amendment bill would close the channels of diplomatic communication with India. On the diplomatic dialogue to discuss the outstanding boundary issue, Nepal seems to have adopted a twin approach. A public call for dialogue combined with an active private effort to scuttle it.In public pronouncements, including in response to questions of lawmakers in Parliament on the status of dialogue with India, Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali had expressed surprise that India was sitting down for talks with China but was ignoring Nepal’s offer for talks. Why indeed has India not offered to sit down for talks? Has it actually snubbed Nepal’s request, as Pradeep Kumar Gyawali seems to claim.Also Read: In 4 sentences, Army chief hints India’s approach to Nepal after map rowA top foreign ministry source in Kathmandu, however, told Hindustan Times that this wasn’t accurate.The source said India had made a clear-cut offer of a foreign secretary-level phone call; to be followed by a video conference between the two foreign secretaries and then, a visit of Nepal’s foreign secretary to India to discuss the boundary issue.External affairs ministry sources in New Delhi confirmed that this offer was available with foreign minister Gyawali and Prime Minister Oli even before the constitution amendment bill was tabled.This offer was made a full one week before foreign minister Gyawali stated that India has been snubbing Nepal’s requests for talks on the border issue.Only foreign minister Gyawali can answer if an offer of a phone call, a video conference and exchange of visits a snub as he described it.Nepal’s foreign ministry sources confirmed that Prime Minister Oli seemed disinterested in India’s offer. For reasons best known to him, he was neither ready to halt nor take a step back on the constitutional amendment despite knowing that the constitutional amendment is viewed by India as an irrevocable step which predetermines the outcome of any future negotiations. Indeed, according to some interlocutors, in his private meetings, Prime Minister Oli has reportedly conveyed that he would proceed ahead with the amendment irrespective of the impact it might have on people-to-people relations between India and Nepal.What we seem to have here is a carefully crafted pattern of deceit and deception where the Indian offer is not shared with Parliamentarians; and public and lawmakers are misled - all so that PM Oli can damage the special relationship that the people of the two countries continue to nurture. Given that PM Oli has ignored that offer of diplomatic dialogue and gone ahead with amending the constitution, it is now up to him to create, if he so wishes, a conducive atmosphere in case he is interested in a bilateral dialogue on the boundary issue. A leader of PM Oli’s experience and wisdom would know well that the time for verbal fudging is over; he now needs to walk the talk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-pm-oli-rejected-india-s-offer-for-dialogue/story-REZvZfQDb2tySTGjEMh3gL.html
14-06-2020||India||Two security guards dead after attack by former colleagues||New Delhi: Two guards deployed at an under-construction residential complex in outer Delhi’s Narela died on Sunday a day after their six former colleagues thrashed them days after they quarrelled over some money, police said.Deputy police commissioner Gaurav Sharma said the suspects worked for the same construction firm as the two until they were sacked some weeks ago for reasons not yet clear. “About 8-10 days ago, they drank with the [two] guards and ...there was a quarrel over ₹1,000-1,500. The fatal thrashing was in revenge for that,” he said, citing initial probe.Sharma identified the two by their first names as Amit, 22, and Sunil, 24, who were from Uttar Pradesh’s Baghpat. Sharma said the alleged attackers “wanted to beat them severely but not murder them”. He added they were registering a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. “If the autopsy report suggests something else, we may change it to murder,” said Sharma.A person can be imprisoned for up to 10 years if convicted of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The punishment for murder is life imprisonment or death.Till more evidence is found, the police have detained two of the six suspects. Sharma said the police received a call about the assault a little before midnight on Saturday. “The call was about some men beating up the two guards with sticks. When the other guards ran on hearing their cries, the suspects ran into a forested area nearby,” he said. He said the two guards were first taken to Maharshi Valmiki Hospital from where they were referred to Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital in Rohini. “They succumbed to their injuries on Sunday,” he said.Sharma said the guards suffered fractures to their limbs, which suggests that the aim of the assailants was to beat them severely, but not kill them.He added the roles of some outsiders not associated with the firm were also being probed.A security guard allegedly bludgeoned another guard to death with a blunt object and burnt his body after pouring liquor on it in the basement of a vacant building in Greater Kailash Part 2 on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-security-guards-dead-after-attack-by-former-colleagues/story-2PJWsiNmIU425RZoUjMvDO.html
14-06-2020||India||Recoveries cross 50k in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: The number of recovered Covid-19 patients in Maharashtra crossed 50,000 on Sunday as the state health minister said the infection peak had begun and local authorities pushed for a limited resumption of local train services in Mumbai. Officials said 1,632 patients recovered and were discharged from various hospitals across the state on Sunday, taking the total number of recovered patients to 50,978.The case tally stood at 107,958 with 3,390 infections recorded on Sunday. This was the fifth consecutive day when more than 3000 cases were reported. The state reported 120 deaths, taking toll to 3950. But state health minister Rajesh Tope held out hope. He said that the Covid-19 peak has started in the state and that cases would continue to rise for the next 15 days. “The decline is likely to start from June end. I’m saying this going by what is happening in other countries. The situation in the state will stabilise and we will be able to settle down things,” he added.Health officials say that the situation was improving as the growth rate of new cases was decreasing and the doubling rate of new cases was increasing.“We can say that the rate of growth of new cases has considerably slowed down and our case doubling rate is now better than the national average. Daily new cases in Mumbai is almost constant in the last last seven days,” said Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, health department.The doubling rate, the number of days it takes for cases on a given date to double, in Maharashtra currently is 21.3 days of the state whereas the national average is 17.1 days.Meanwhile, a meeting of Central and Western railway officials along with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation(BMC) discussed plans to resume local train services for essential workers. The proposal was sent to the Union railway ministry for approval.An official said no more than 700 passengers may be allowed inside one local train. A 12-compartment train has a capacity of 1200 passengers but routinely, 5,000 commuters cram into the space during peak hours. Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean, KEM Hospital in Mumbai, also stressed that fewer critical patients were admitted in the last few days. “My personal experience is that we have seen gradual decrease in the number of admissions of critical patients in the last five days. I can see two reasons for this, one we have developed more centres for critically ill patients and second, the disease is probably getting stabilised. We have succeeded in reducing the criticalness of the disease due to aggressive contract tracing. We are getting more patients with mild symptoms.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/recoveries-cross-50k-in-maharashtra/story-QAx9GKm5ApBtYtRKDvOx5K.html
14-06-2020||India||With curbs relaxed, Covid-19 cases spike in Himalayan states||New Delhi: Himalayan regions of Ladakh, Sikkim, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand have reported a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases over the past week amid the easing of curbs after two-month national lockdown to contain the spread of the pandemic.The unrestricted interstate movement was allowed from June 1 as part of the Centre’s first of a three-phase plan--Unlock 1.0--to lift stringent restrictions.Officials in Ladakh said the region had reported 131 cases over three months until Friday, which involved mostly pilgrims, who had returned from Iran. The region reported 198 cases on Saturday and 112 on Sunday and prompted authorities to ban public transport and adopt an odd-even system for the private vehicles other than those involved in essential services.Jammu & Kashmir reported close to 5,000 Covid-19 cases (NEED EXACT NUMBER) and 60 deaths until Sunday. Most of the cases--3,800--have been reported from the Kashmir Valley. Officials said the number of cases has increased over the last week because of the return of Kashmiris from other parts of the country. “There is no reason for panic. Most of the cases are in institutional quarantine or hospitals. There is no community spread....,” said financial commissioner (health) Atal Dulloo. He added most of the lockdown conditions were continuing in the worst-hit areas. Sikkim, which was Covid-19 free until May 22, had only 12 cases as of Thursday. The cases increased to 68 by Sunday. On Friday, 50 people, most of whom had returned from Mumbai, tested positive for the disease in the state. The spike in the cases has prompted the state to postpone reopening of schools from July 1 to August 1 and impose restrictions on vehicular transport. “All precautions are being taken. No person will be allowed to enter Sikkim now,” said chief minister Prem Singh Tamang. He said the cases will reduce now as most of the returnees have been tested.Sikkim has made it mandatory for returnees to undergo 28-day institutional and home quarantine. Pempa Bhutia, the state health secretary, said no health worker has so far tested positive and the state healthcare infrastructure is adequate enough to deal with the situation. Officials in Uttarakhand said about 30% of the state’s 1,816 cases until Sunday have been reported over the last five days and involved mostly migrants, whose return has picked up pace due to the easing of lockdown norms. “The cases may have increased but the situation is under control and we have created enough health infrastructure to deal with the increase,” said Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat.Officials said one-fourth of Himachal’s 512 cases as of Sunday have been reported over the last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-curbs-relaxed-covid-19-cases-spike-in-himalayan-states/story-GZ2yF3rRyqmliwJtyWVk7I.html
14-06-2020||India||BJP takes digital route to connect with voters||With key states headed for the polls later this year and next year, and with the coronavirus disease showing no sign of abating, the poll campaign of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be built around digital rallies that highlight the achievements of the first year of its second stint in power, according to leaders familiar with the details.“With the pandemic yet to abate, going forward, most of the rallies by leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will be held digitally,” a senior party functionary said.Addressing a virtual rally for Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday, Union defence minister Rajnath Singh said the mode of outreach was “samvaad ka ek rasta (a way to communicate)”, and added that a new world where physical distancing is the keyword has nudged politics towards the path of “digital India”.Singh’s address was among the 75 such rallies planned by the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government, but party leaders said these virtual events were likely to continue as part of poll campaigning. While Bihar will go to polls later this year, West Bengal, Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry will vote in 2021 to elect a new government.Digital outreachSoon after the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 25 to stop the spread of Covid-19, the BJP, which has 180 million member members, set the tone for political engagements in the time of social distancing. Party leaders, led by their president JP Nadda, began holding virtual meetings with workers right down to the booth level.“It was decided at a general secretary’s meeting that the party can connect digitally with masses and its workers. Ram Madhav (also a general secretary) was the one who suggested the idea and drew up the plan, which was new to a lot of people,” said a second BJP functionary.National secretaries Tarun Chugh and Satya Kumar were given the charge to plan the rallies. “Big states can have more than one rally and the target audience here is at least 50,000 (for one rally), while in the smaller states, the target audience is 25,000,” the second functionary said.Union home minister Amit Shah’s rally in Bihar on May 31, which marked the beginning of the programme, recorded over 3.9 million impressions in real time. These rallies are live-streamed on social media. “The response far exceeded expectations,” said BJP Bihar unit president Sanjay Jaiswal.In that rally, Shah, however, said it was not about elections but about boosting the morale of the people amid the Covid-19 outbreak, though the Opposition criticised his party over the timing of the programme.PreparationsThe first step to organise rallies is a meeting through video calling. Senior leaders are instructed to hold meetings with workers on a daily basis to discuss the party’s activities during the pandemic. This helps the party cadre prepare the logistics for digital rallies, such as internet services.“For the May 31 rally addressed by the home minister, information technology (IT) sanyojaks, or coordinators, were appointed at the panchayat level to train party members on how to share data of those who watched the rally. Bihar shattered the myth that party workers in far-flung areas are not tech-savvy,” Jaiswal said.A list is drawn up in every district of party workers with smartphones and access to the internet, and this is followed up with IT training.“PM Modi has said we need to turn this challenge (Covid-19) into an opportunity, and that’s exactly what we have done. We have been holding regular IT training lessons for our workers,” said VD Sharma, president of the Madhya Pradesh unit.Captive audienceGetting people to tune in for the digital rallies has an added advantage for the BJP. “Earlier, we used to ask people to give a missed call to connect with us. Now, when they log on, we get their details and we can then forge a connection with them. Those who are not supporters also log on to the rallies. Our booth-level workers will reach out to these people while maintaining the norms of social distancing,” said the first functionary.  Sharma said the party formed WhatsApp groups in every district of not just party workers but of residents as well. “For the Nitin Gadkari rally in Madya Pradesh on June 10, people from 45,000 of the total 65,000 blocks connected through social media and primarily WhatsApp,” he said.Digital outreach is not new to the party; it explored the hologram technology in 2012 during the Gujarat assembly polls and scaled it to a pan-India level in 2014 during the general elections. The party is also known for effectively using social media to reach out to people.From novelty to routineRajyavardhan Rathore, a parliamentarian from Rajasthan and a former minister, did not expect to see a bunch of people on the screen when he dialled a party worker in a district in the state. “Earlier meetings used to be held in designated areas; now with the facility of video calling our workers can speak to us from the comfort of their homes, surrounded by their families,” he said.The idea of a “big leader” calling on a worker’s phone is fascinating for many.“There is a lot of interest in VCs (video conferences)…The process itself has become very disciplined and streamlined; workers now follow the etiquette of muting mikes while other speak,” said Rathore, who, like several of his party colleagues, makes multiple such calls every day.EconomicalEven as the BJP dismissed allegations by the Opposition that it distributed television and mobile sets ahead of the rallies, most leaders concurred that digital outreach was cost efficient.“There is a humongous amount of money spent on organising rallies…While we are still advertising about the rallies and putting up posters and banners; it still is a huge money-saver,” said the first functionary.ImpactWill the digital rallies evoke the same response that a public rally does?“Earlier we used to meet in public rallies, look into each other’s eyes, read facial expressions, but that is not possible here, but samvaad ka ek rasta has been found,” defence minister Singh said on Sunday.Political commentator Abhay Deshpande said the rallies are a good way of keeping workers motivated and engaged, but it was yet to be seen if they found acceptance among the electorate. “When such rallies get picked by the mainstream media as news, it helps spread the message. But primarily, these are party-worker oriented,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-takes-digital-route-to-connect-with-voters/story-UK3uC0IDeLrSEcFhCDUxrM.html

People came out in several localities in Bhopal to watch the swarms of locusts with curiosity and make videos with their smartphones. There are two groups of swarms, including a big one spread in the area of about 1.5 kilometres near a canal at Kolar Road and another in the Berasia area. The swarm of locusts in the Berasia area had moved into jungles but returned to the same area with winds, said deputy director, Agriculture in Bhopal SN Sonaniya.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe officer said, “We have sought help from the fire brigade to use fire tenders to spray chemicals on the insects when they settle on trees in the night. It’s difficult to spray chemicals with normal sprayers given the height of trees on which they settle. We hope to control them tonight.”Deputy director of Agriculture department in Raisen NP Suman said, “We have got reports about swarms of locusts from a couple of places. Since there is no crop in the agriculture field, the farmers are not worried but continuation of their presence in the state may pose a threat to kharif crops. We are trying to control them.”As per another official from the agriculture department, about 35 districts have been affected so far by desert locusts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swarms-of-desert-locusts-enter-bhopal-people-shoot-videos/story-zogcnrwX7ASnzP6E6RQzWK.html

Shah was chairing a meeting, his second today, to review the Covid-19 health crisis in the national capital which has been reporting a surge in coronavirus cases.The home minister during today’s meeting directed the Delhi government, all three Mayors and the three municipal corporations of the city to work together and implement the decisions taken in the first meeting held earlier on Sunday morning. “The Modi government is determined to prevent the coronavirus infection in Delhi. To stop the spread of the virus, testing will be doubled in the next two days and after six days the testing will be increased three-fold. Subsequently, after a few days, every polling station in the containment zones will be covered for testing,” Shah said in a tweet earlier today.ALSO READ | Amit Shah to hold all-party meet tomorrow to review Delhi’s Covid-19 crisisShah also directed the Delhi Police Commissioner to ensure all guidelines to curb the spread of Covid-19 are enforced strictly in the national capital.

Earlier this month, the government allowed places of worship, religious places, shopping centres and restaurants to reopen. But business has been slow to pick up with many restaurants and malls running empty.Many places of worship have also decided not to reopen despite the government’s go-ahead as Covid-19 cases in the country continue to soar.The Centre also lifted restrictions on travel and has allowed the resumption of all modes of transport. But many states have their own quarantine protocol which means arriving passengers are first quarantined before being allowed to go.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-plan-under-consideration-for-another-lockdown-says-govt/story-rsCz52kiZyGHVe7fNb35sJ.html

After it has been removed, J&K has been mainstreamed and now there will be an investigation on the corruption in the state that stopped its development,’’ Nadda was quoted as saying by a tweet from BJP’s official account.The BJP has consistently in the past blamed a “few families” for obstructing development of Kashmir for their vested interests.Nadda also said that contrary to the claims made by Jammu and Kashmir politicians like former chief minister and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, the region was happy with the decision to do away with Article 370. “Mehbooba Mufti had said that rivers of blood will flow if Article 370 is abrogated. Not a single drop of blood was shed. We are happy that Jammu & Kashmir became an integral part of India but people of J&K are happier than us with the move,” Nadda was quoted as saying by ANI.The Centre had abrogated Article 370 and bifurcated the erstwhile state through a presidential order and a parliamentary resolution passed in August last year, followed by a security clampdown in the newly carved Union Territory in apprehension of trouble on the ground instigated by Pakistan.Also Read: Pakistan on one side, China on another: Gadkari underlines India’s approach to neighboursSeveral leaders were detained and a communication blockade was enforced in the region which has been eased gradually since then along with the release of most of the detained political leadership. Earlier today, defence minister Rajnath Singh told the people of Jammu that the centre was committed to developing Jammu and Kashmir to such an extent that it leads to people in Pak occupied Kashmir raising demands to stay with India and not Pakistan. He also described Article 370 as a stain that had been done away with the blink of an eyelid by his party led government.Article 370 an old stain, done away in a blink of an eye: Rajnath Singh“In the next five years, J&K’s image will undergo a sea change and the people of PoJK will be envious of it. And, wait for some time, PoJK will demand to be with India and not with Pakistan. The day it happens, our unanimous resolution of the Parliament will also be fulfilled,” Rajnath had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/probe-in-j-k-corruption-jp-nadda-says-graft-had-stalled-region-s-development/story-FJckbD5ewopmnZgmM4h37L.html

14-06-2020||India||Kerala CM asks PM Modi to arrange Covid-19 tests in embassies for expats||Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has sought Prime Minister Modi’s help in making arrangements in embassies for Covid-19 tests of expatriates returning to India,The request came after the southern state, amid rising numbers of Covid-19 cases of expatriates returning home, issued an order for mandatory certificates on Saturday. The order, however, will not apply to those arriving on Vande Bharat Mission flight.“From June 20, all private chartered flights departing to Kerala from Middle-East countries shall only carry passengers who have been tested for Covid-19 infection and shown to be negative. A test certificate to that effect should be carried by the passenger. It applies to all flights for which consent letters were issued earlier,” said the government order issued by State Principal Secretary K Elangovan on Friday. In a letter written to the prime minister, Vijayan said if the PCR test was not possible, at least rapid anti-body tests should be done.He added that if everyone was allowed to travel together, chances of spread of coronavirus infection would be quite high and therefore, the infected can be accommodated in separate flights.Meanwhile, state health minister KK Shailaja said a final decision on expats from Gulf countries carrying a Covid-free certificate will be taken after the CM’s video conference with the Prime Minister on Tuesday. “It was not meant to put any impediments on the return of people. We suggested this after many people coming from Gulf countries are getting tested positive. Infected persons pose danger to co-passengers especially pregnant women and aged,” she said, adding it was not good to always oppose decisions meant to check further spread of the virus.But many expatriates said the state was keen to maintain its records and not interested in its people who were desperate to come back from the middle-eastern countries. There are an estimated 18 lakh people from the state working in Gulf countries. At least 215 people from Kerala have died of Covid-19 in the Gulf countries in the last two months.Meanwhile, the state reported 54 fresh coronavirus cases on Sunday, taking the total to 2,461. Of these, 1,340 are active cases, said the CM’s office. Twenty people have succumbed to the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-asks-pm-modi-to-arrange-covid-19-tests-in-embassies-for-expats/story-DRxoClqn2A7Lj7OdPs1XmK.html

The family shifted to the toilet that had been constructed under Swachh Bharat Mission. Their plight came to light following social media posts.Senapati’s husband, Ramesh Senapati, a daily labourer tried hard to get a house under the government scheme, but his name never appeared in the list. “He met local BDO as well as other officials pleading for sanction of a house, but all that he got was empty promise,” said Banita. The family has spread out a tin sheet on the toilet floor to cover the pan. The toilet also doubles up as a kitchen as they cook food in one corner and keep clothes in another corner. While the ward member, her daughter and mother-in-law sleep inside the toilet, her husband and son sleep outside.“My getting elected as a ward member has not helped me in any way. While the government talks about empowering panchayati raj institutions, this is how the elected PRI members are forced to stay,” she said.Sarpanch Minati Sahu also expressed her helplessness saying she had personally requested officials to add her family in the PMAY list, but without any result.The government says it is not aware of her plight.Project director of the district rural development agency in Nayagarh, Subash Ray said the administration was not aware of the problem of the ward member. “We will conduct an inquiry and do whatever necessary to help the family,” he said.In December last year, a 72-year-old widow in Mayurbhanj district was found to be living in a toilet for over three years after failing to get accommodation from the state government. The woman, Draupadi Behera slept inside the toilet while her family, including grandson and daughter, slept outside.In March this year, chief minister Naveen Patnaik said his government would provide 20 lakh concrete houses to the poor in the next four years. Patnaik said that the state government has already provided 25 lakh concrete houses to the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-destroyed-in-cyclone-family-of-five-in-odisha-lives-in-a-toilet/story-t3d8Yu5GAqRHTTp9h2oDyO.html

This is not possible. Examples of Kerala/Karnataka/Korea demonstrates that testing -tracing- treatment accompanied by aggressive containment & public adherence to masks & distancing is key,” Kant said in a tweet.With 9,195 fatalities till Sunday, India is the ninth worst-hit nation in terms of Covid-19 deaths, while the highest spike of 11,929 cases took the tally to over 3.20 lakh, of which over half have recovered from the disease.According to the Union health ministry data, the country recorded 311 new deaths in the 24-hour period till Sunday morning while the recovery rate rose to above 50 per cent with 1,62,378 patients cured so far, leaving 1,49,348 cases active.The Johns Hopkins University, which has been compiling Covid-19 data from all over the world, put India in the ninth position in terms of death toll and fourth in terms of total caseload.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-for-adequate-testing-aggressive-containment-by-states-to-manage-covid-crisis-amitabh-kant/story-3AvoGGHCBa38vuatjeCzGK.html

This indicates that of all the cases of Covid-19, half of them have recovered from the disease,” said an official statement from the ministry.It added that the healthy recovery rate was a result of “timely case identification” and “proper clinical management”. Currently, 1,49,348 active cases are under medical supervision across the country, it claimed.The Indian government is constantly enhancing its capacity for testing, an integral component of case identification protocol, with the number of government labs involved in testing rising to 646 and private labs numbers increasing to 247. With this a total of 893 labs in India are currently carrying out testing for Sars-Cov-2 virus. According to the official figures, 1,51,432 samples were tested in the last 24 hours alone taking the total number of samples tested thus far to 56,58,614.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesIndia is currently the fourth worst affected country by the pandemic with 3,20,922 total confirmed cases which is only behind the USA (2,143,177), Brazil (850,796) and Russia (528,964) as per the latest figures available on worldometers.com coronavirus dashboard. However, the country is faring much better than other worst-hit countries in terms of cases per million of population. India has recorded 234 cases per million of its population, the spread of the disease in other countries has been war greater—US (6,477/million), Brazil (4,004/million), Russia (3,625/million), UK (4,337/million). On the flip side, it could also mean that a large section of India’s population has not been exposed to the disease so far, a possibility also recognised by Indian authorities. India is also placed much better in terms of numbers of deaths per million of population, which is 7 per million of India’s population currently. Other countries like the US (355/million), Brazil (201/million), Russia (48/million) and UK (614/million), had posted a higher number of deaths in ratio to their population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-latest-india-s-recovery-rate-past-50-mark-daily-tests-cross-1-5-lakh/story-vymWcRT5AFa3sV83lgoocK.html

Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who accompanied Pradhan to the disaster site and relief camps , said a model and a veterinary hospital, a higher secondary school and a skill development centre will be set up in Baghjan. “Today I announce that the Baghajan embankment will be constructed at a cost of Rs 27 crore,” he said.“We will compensate all the affected people. Tea gardens, betel nut trees, fishes, houses and any other properties that have been damaged will be compensated in consultation with the Assam government,” Pradhan told people living in a relief camp.After visiting the well site, the Union minister said the Centre and the state government are trying for a permanent solution to the disaster so that it never recurs.“Oil India is an Assamese company. It has been working here for many decades. Both the Centre and the state have constituted high-level inquiry committees. We will punish the culprit for this disaster even if he is a powerful man,” Pradhan asserted.The company and the Tinsukia district administration have moved more than 7,000 people from nearby areas of the gas well site to 14 relief camps.Sonowal said all the affected people will be compensated after a thorough survey by the administration. The chief minister announced that a concrete road between Baghjan and Tinsukia city will be constructed. A women self-help group of the area will be provided financial assistance.“The Maguri-Motapung wetland is Baghjan’s property. Oil India will clean the wetland,” he said.Sonowal said experts are trying their best to douse the blaze as soon as possible for rehabilitating the displaced people.Interacting with the two leaders, the locals submitted a memorandum with a host of demands for rehabilitation and compensation.After reaching Guwahati on Saturday night, Pradhan held a review meeting with Sonowal in presence of Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Minister of State for Environment and Forest Naba Kumar Doley and BJP Lok Sabha Member Topon Kumar Gogoi.The well number 5 at Baghjan has been spewing gas uncontrollably for the last 19 days and it caught fire on Tuesday afternoon.The blaze at the well is so massive that it can be seen from a distance of more than 30 kms with thick black smoke going up several metres high, endangering the local biodiversities.Though there is no fire in the periphery of the well site at present, the company has declared an area up to 1.5 km of radius as “red zone” to avoid any untoward incident.At present, five inquiries are taking place to find out facts -- a three-member probe by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, a one-member probe ordered by the chief minister and an internal five-member inquiry by OIL.Besides, two more crucial independent investigations of technical nature are being carried out by the Directorate General Of Mines Safety (DGMS) and Oil Industry Safety Directorate (OISD).The chief minister also ordered the Additional Principal Conservator of Forest (Wildlife) to conduct a study on the impact of the explosion on the environment and ecology of the surrounding areas, including on flora and fauna in the adjacent Dibru-Saikhowa National Park.Already two officials of OIL have been suspended for alleged negligence of duty at the gas well site, while a show-cause notice has been to John Energy Pvt Ltd, the outsourced private operator of the well.A case has also been registered against Oil India and John Energy over the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-oil-to-compensate-all-affected-in-assam-gas-well-tragedy/story-hbqMklE7MMyHnYrGSvms4O.html

After that, the new map will be used in all official documents, including the coat of arms.Meanwhile, the main Opposition Nepali Congress has urged the government to intensify diplomatic efforts to ensure the country’s rights in the Kalapani area after the country includes its updated political and administrative map in the Constitution, the Himalayan Times reported.In a press statement on Saturday, the party said the “campaign to reclaim encroached territories would enter the second phase after the revised map incorporating Limpiyadhura, Lipulek and Kalapani areas as its parts, gets endorsed and this would mark a significant solidarity in the issue of nationality.” Reacting to Kathmandu’s move, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said on Saturday “this artificial enlargement of claims is not based on historical fact or evidence and is not tenable. It is also violative of our current understanding to hold talks on outstanding boundary issues.” The India-Nepal bilateral ties came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory.Nepal last month released the revised political and administrative map of the country laying claim over the strategically key areas, more than six months after India published a new map in November 2019.India had then sternly asked Nepal not to resort to any “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-s-upper-house-endorses-proposal-to-consider-amendment-to-update-new-political-map/story-vLbGhYcER6K8S99ZIxBTeN.html

On June 23, the chariots of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra would be pulled on the Grand Road from the Jagannath temple to Gundicha temple over a distance of 2.5 km.“We are inclined to observe that deploying heavy-duty machinery or any other means like elephants, than the man power, for pulling the chariots, would obviously obviate the necessity of involving a large number of persons. It is therefore directed that this aspect should be duly considered by the Government while taking a decision for holding Rath Yatra, consistent with the guidelines issued by the Central and State governments. It is up to the State Government to decide whether or not to allow the Rath Yatra on June 23,” the division bench of Chief Justice Mohammad Rafiq and Justice Biswajit Mohanty said Saturday while disposing off the petition.The order was made available on Sunday.The three wooden chariots of the three deities are quite heavy as they are made out of over 13,000 cubic ft timber. Thousands of devotees pull the chariots with sturdy ropes tied around. After making their journey to Gundicha temple, the three deities stay there for eight days and return to the Jagannath temple on the ninth day in a similar fashion.Earlier this month, Snana Purnima, the ritual bathing event of the three deities was held in the temple without the presence of a single devotee. Only the priests who tested negative for Covid-19 were allowed to participate in the ritual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/machines-or-elephants-may-pull-chariots-in-puri-rath-yatra-this-time-instead-of-devotees/story-Dm9tZaSxvNktjlYp0eTfXK.html

Gadkari’s comments come amid tensions with China and Nepal over conflicting territorial claims and an assertion to never compromise India’s pride, made by union defence minister Rajnath Singh earlier today.“Pakistan is on one side of our country, China on the other side. We want peace & non-violence. We never tried to snatch the land of Bhutan or Bangladesh. We don’t want the land of Pakistan or China either. The only thing we want is peace” Union minister Nitin Gadkari was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Gadkari’s comments come in the backdrop of India expressing unhappiness with Nepal’s parliament passing a constitutional amendment to include Indian territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura in the map of the Himalayan nation. India has described Nepal’s actions as ‘unilateral’ and ‘artificial enlargement’ of claims, which was not based on ‘historical fact’ or ‘evidence’On the other hand, Indian and Chinese troops were engaged in a phased pull out from a military build-up at the Ladakh boundary which has lasted for around 6 weeks and also resulted in violent clashes between the two sides.Earlier today, defence minister Rajnath Singh, while addressing people in Jammu through a video link, also stressed on India’s preference for peacefully resolving the dispute with China through talks even as he asserted that India won’t compromise on national pride.“Talks are underway with China at the diplomatic and military level. China, too, expressed its wish to resolve this issue via talks. I would like to inform the Opposition that our government won’t keep anyone in the dark. I assure you that we won’t compromise with national pride in any situation,” Singh said.‘Won’t keep anyone in dark’: Rajnath Singh’s swipe at Opposition over LAC tensionThe Chinese build-up along the line of actual control (LAC) started in May first week along the Ladakh sector and Sikkim where they engaged Indian troops in a face off. Thereafter the tensions between forces of the two countries escalated further along other areas along the LAC. Situation eased after several rounds of talks between the two sides at diplomatic and military level.Rajnath Singh said that India was no longer a weak country but its strength was not meant to scare anyone but was for its own security.“India has become strong in its national security. India is no longer a weak India. Our strength has risen. But this strength is not meant to frighten anyone. If we are increasing our strength we are doing so to secure our country,” Singh was quoted as saying.Gadkari and Singh’s comments could also be seen in the context of Nepal’s lower house of parliament approving a new political map laying claim over the strategically important areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura along the border with India. In a sharp reaction, New Delhi called it an untenable claim.Nepal okays map tweak, India calls it ‘untenable’ “This artificial enlargement of claims is not based on historical fact or evidence and is not tenable.

14-06-2020||India||Bengal governor seeks Mamata Banerjee’s apology for ‘inhuman’ disposal of corpse||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday demanded a public apology from chief minister Mamata Banerjee days after a video emerged showing a decomposed corpse being dragged by the neck with tongs by a morgue employee at a crematorium in Kolkata.“Horrendous unimaginable horror of dragging human bodies by pair of tongs would haunt us for long. PUBLIC APOLOGY @MamataOfficial by way of atonement is expected. This barbarity is indelible taint on humanity. Disposal of dead body is solemn act- dominated by spirituality,” Dhankhar tweeted on Sunday.He had already attacked the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) government on Twitter for two days over the video.The video, which was allegedly shot on June 10, surfaced on June 11 and went viral. The morgue employee could be seen putting the body inside a Kolkata civic corporation van. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Communist Party of India (Marxist) leaders alleged that the van carried several decomposed corpses of Covid-19 victims and it was an effort to hide death figures.The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and the health department, however, produced records which showed that unclaimed bodies lying at NRS hospital morgue were taken for cremation to the Garia crematoriums since the Dhapa dumping ground, where such unclaimed bodies are cremated round the year, has been reserved for Hindus dying of Covid-19. The state home department on Saturday took to Twitter saying fake news was being spread that the bodies were that of Covid-19 victims.In his tweets on Sunday, Dhankhar made it apparent that he was not ready to accept the state’s explanation. “Calling videos as fake is inexcusable blunder -adding injury to shameless insult. Those orchestrating Remote controlled response @MamataOfficial have no idea of anger of people at enormity of this crime. Before reacting Reflect-if one of the 14 was part of your family!” wrote Dhankhar. On Saturday, Kolkata Police tweeted, “West Bengal Health Department has informed that dead bodies were not of COVID patients, but were unclaimed/ unidentified bodies from Hospital Morgue. Legal action is being taken against persons spreading #FakeNews.”“GOWB respects the credo of dignity at death and, while handling the COVID pandemic, it has espoused the principle by laying down transparent procedures regarding disclosure of facts, opportunities given to bereaved relatives for showing last respect to the deceased, disposal of dead bodies etc. The recent misinformation drive to project an isolated incident of a particular agency’s handling of some unidentified and decomposed dead bodies lying (post accidents etc) in a morgue has no relationship whatsoever with the current pandemic. This has been communicated in writing and in person by most senior state officials even to Hon’ble Governor,” the home department said in a series of tweets on Saturday after state officials met Dhankhar.“Since the governor has demanded apology from the chief minister I cannot comment on her behalf. All I can say is the governor is deeply involved in politics,” said a senior cabinet minister who requested anonymity.Dhankhar came under fire from TMC leaders for his comments over the past two days.Addressing the governor as “Uncle ji” TMC member of Parliament Mahua Moitra tweeted, “GovernorWB back to firing BJP arrows at state govt which is handling covid, amphan & migrant return smoothly all at once. A (rotten) apple never falls far from the tree.”TMC’s former Barrackpore Lok Sabha MP Dinesh Trivedi tweeted, “@jdhankhar1 the only thing that has been compromised is the integrity of the office of the Governor. You have stayed consistently silent on the achievements of the state while looking for every little opportunity to malign it’s image.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-governor-seeks-mamata-banerjee-s-apology-for-inhuman-disposal-of-corpse/story-bQERVwvPIW3T6b7FyHNGAN.html

Off-label application of immunomodulator tocilizumab and convalescent plasma therapy for treating coronavirus patients in moderate stage of criticality, have also been approved by the ministry.Two keys symptoms like the loss of smell (anosmia) and loss of taste (ageusia) have also been added to the list of coronavirus symptoms by the Union Health Ministry. Earlier, during the onset of the disease, several cases were reported where the patients had displayed a loss of smell or taste.In the new set of protocols, the ministry has removed its earlier recommendation of using hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin in severe cases and requiring ICU management. The health ministry in its revised ‘Clinical Management Protocols for COVID-19’, released yesterday, said anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) should only be used in the early stages of the disease and should be avoided in critical cases.ALSO READ | Loss of smell, taste are now key symptoms to identify Covid-19 patients: Health Ministry“As is the case with other anti-virals, this drug should be used as early in the disease course as possible to achieve any meaningful effect and should be avoided in patients with severe disease,” the document read.Since no vaccine for coronavirus has been developed by any country so far, despite scientists working frantically to develop one, the Centre has said it is pursing some “investigational therapies”. “Use of these drugs is subjected to limited availability in the country as of now. Currently, these drugs should only be used in a defined subgroup of patients,” the updated document said. These medicines include Remdesivir, which can be taken under emergency; convalescent plasma therapy, tocilizumab and hydroxychloroquine.ALSO READ | Coronavirus pandemic: Remdesivir slows Covid-19 progression in macaquesSenior citizens, those who are over 60 years of age are particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus.

Article 370 was an “old stain” and it was done away the moment the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) got the full majority, Rajnath Singh said while addressing the virtual ‘Jammu Jan Samvad rally’.Singh said that by abrogating Article 370, BJP fulfilled its decade-old promise and is committed to the development and growth Jammu and Kashmir.“We revoked it within 100 days in office at the blink of an eye. But I would like to ask why the Congress, which had a full majority but had supported Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, remained discreetly silent on it,” Rajnath Singh said.“When we revoked it in August last year, the Congress called it an attack on secularism. But may I ask the Congress why the word ‘secularism’ remained absent from the preamble of the J&K Constitution?” he asked.Singh pointed out that the discriminatory temporary provision was incorporated through an ordinance and not Parliament.“If Article 370 was so important then why didn’t the Congress make it a permanent provision and why it was kept as a temporary provision?” he asked.Singh said that the so-called during ‘Azadi’ movement in Kashmir, Pakistani and ISIS flags were hoisted with impunity but now the Tricolor could be seen across the Kashmir Valley.The defence minister said that with an end to Article 370 oppressed people like refugees from Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) and west Pakistan and the Valmiki community got equal rights after more than 70 years of Independence.“Today, I recall our visionary leader AB Vajpayee, who believed in Kashmiriyat, Jamhuriyat and Insaniyat. The BJP stands committed and today for us Kashmiriyat is Hazratbal shrine and Amarnath Baba,” he said.Singh said that in the next five years the Narendra Modi-led government will bring a sea-change in Jammu and Kashmir’s image.“The people of PoK will be envious of it.

Subsequently, Maoists contacted Jagat Pujari and asked him to buy a tractor for them.

Many people including the Opposition have raised questions. From time to time, information is being given to the people but I would like to inform that military level talks are on to resolve the dispute.”Even as the two sides are reported to be engaged in a phased de-escalation from more than a month long military standoff, Singh asserted that India wouldn’t compromise with national pride as it was no longer a “weak nation”.“China also wants resolution via talks and India also wants to resolve this tussle through diplomatic and military talks. I would like to tell the Opposition that we don’t want to keep anyone in the dark. We would divulge everything at an appropriate time. For now, I can say with confidence and conviction that we can never make any compromise with our national pride. India is not a weak nation anymore. Our power has increased manifold,” he said.The defence minister said that India was strengthening its forces to secure the country and not to scare anyone.In this contest he also referred to the US president’s invite to India at the G7 summit to substantiate his claims of India’s growing popularity and power at the international forum.“Our India is in secure hands. The BJP government appointed the chief of defence staff without wasting any time. The issue of national security was hanging afire the past 15 to 20 years. We did it in a single stroke,” he said.“Rafale will be delivered to us in July and they will increase our power. We don’t want to scare anyone but they will strengthen our defence forces”, he added.Also Read: ‘Won’t keep anyone in dark’: Rajnath Singh’s swipe at Opposition over LAC tensionIn next 5 years J&K will undergo a sea-change, even PoJK will clamour to live with India: Rajnath SinghOn the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, the defence minister said that in the next five years, the Modi government will bring a sea-change in the region’s image vis-à-vis progress and development.“In the next five years, J&K’s image will undergo a sea change and the people of PoJK will be envious of it. And, wait for some time, PoJK will demand to be with India and not with Pakistan. The day it happens, our unanimous resolution of the Parliament will also be fulfilled,” he said.He further said, “The weather has changed. Our channels are now showing temperatures (weather forecast) of Muzaffarabad and Gilgit, And, Islamabad is feeling the heat. Therefore, there is now more mischief (on the borders and in Kashmir) but our security forces and agencies are giving them a befitting reply. Terrorists are being killed in large numbers in the Valley these days.”Rajnath added that it’s not just the Rs 2 lakh crore package for Jammu and Kashmir, the Modi government has been according top priority to the UT, which was evident from the construction of bunkers all along the Indo-Pak borders to shield the villages, reservation benefits to the residents living along the international border on the lines of LoC villagers and strengthening of PRIs.He also informed that the work on Delhi-Amritsar-Katra express corridor has also been started.Article 370 an old stain, done away with at the blink of an eye: RajnathRajnath Singh took potshots at BJP’s arch-rival Congress for its “silence” on Article 370 and 35-A and said, “We revoked it within 100 days in office, at the blink of an eyelid, but I would like to ask why Congress, which had a full majority but had supported Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, remained silent on it. When we revoked it in August last year, Congress called it an attack on secularism. But may I ask Congress why the word ‘secularism’ remained absent from the preamble of the J&K Constitution?”Article 370 was an old stain and the moment we got full majority, it was done away with at the blink of an eye, he added.He recalled how the discriminatory temporary provision was incorporated via an ordinance and not via an act of the Parliament.“Had Article 370 been so integral, then why Congress didn’t make it a permanent provision and why it was kept as a temporary provision,” he asked.Singh said that during the so-called ‘Azadi’ movement in Kashmir, Pakitani and ISIS flags were hoisted with impunity but now Tricolors could be seen across the valley.The defence minister said that with an end to Article 370, the oppressed people like refugees from PoJK, West Pak refugees and Valmiki community got equal rights after more than 70 years of Independence.“Today I recall our visionary leader AB Vajpayee, who believed in Kashmiriyat, Jamhurityat and Insaniyat. BJP stands committed to it and for us Kashmiriyat is Hazratbal shrine and Amarnath Baba,” he said.Rajnath heaped praise on PM Modi vis-à-vis Covid 19 pandemic.Also Read: For Coronavirus Live Updates“Many developed countries like the US, Brazil and Spain were badly hit by the Covid 19 but our PM Modi announced a nationwide lockdown on March 25. Entire India abided by it. Had it not been declared, the magnitude of the damage would have been enormous and difficult to tackle. Even WHO appreciated India for its efforts in tackling this dreaded virus. We strengthened our health infrastructure and started manufacturing PPE kits , which are now being exported to other countries. Here I would like to congratulate J&K for its testing rate, which is second best after Goa.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-wants-to-resolve-dispute-via-talks-india-not-a-weak-nation-anymore-rajnath-singh/story-jKnJDKfNpTo2q34U0H2TjJ.html

However, the district collector has refuted the claim, saying the woman brought her mother to the bank before the manager could visit their home for verification.The incident came to light after a video was widely shared on social media showing 60-year-old Punjimati Dei of Bargaon village in Naupara district dragging a cot with her mother lying on it. In March, the Centre had announced Rs 500 monthly assistance for women Jan Dhan bank account holders from April to June to help the poor tide over the Covid-19 crisis under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan package.According to the villagers, on June 9, Dei went to the local branch of the Utkal Grameen Bank to withdraw Rs 1500 from the account of her bed-ridden mother, Labhe Baghel who is over 100-years-old. However, the bank manager Ajit Pradhan reportedly told her that she had to bring her mother - the account holder – to bank for him to release the money. Dei claimed that since her mother is bed-ridden, she had no option but to drag her charpoy to the bank on the village’s kutcha road the next day. She added that the manager released the money after the duo went to the bank. Reacting to the incident after the video went viral, Naupara’s district collector Madhusmita Sahoo, said that the woman took her mother to the bank despite the manager offering to visit their house the next day for verification.“As the bank is managed by a single person, it was difficult for the manager to go to the woman’s house the same day. However, the manager had assured her that he would visit the woman’s house the next day. Before he would visit, the woman had dragged her mother on a charpoy to the bank,” Sahoo said.The Reserve Bank of India has time and again advised banks to provide separate basic banking facilities such as delivery of cash against withdrawal from the account, pick up of cash and instruments against receipt, delivery of demand drafts, submission of KYC documents and life certificates for senior citizens and individuals with disabilities at the residence of such customers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-woman-drags-100-yr-old-mother-on-cot-to-bank-to-withdraw-pension/story-VUMpNaNbVmF5dayMFm4UEI.html

This will ensure that the mission, which was halted due to the lockdown, will not miss deadlines. It will also help states provide employment to workers at the grassroots,” a government official said.The official said Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat had started reaching out to chief ministers.“As the prime minister often underlines, we are determined to turn this challenge into an opportunity,” he said.Officials said the Centre had asked states to use funds from MNREGA {Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act} to dig trenches for laying pipes and funds from the Jal Jeevan Mission to lay the pipes and carrying out other specialised activities.The government is expected to spend Rs 3.6 lakh crore - Rs 2.08 lakh crore is the central state - to achieve its 2024 target of supplying 55 litres per capita per day.Officials said the government had already released the first tranche of the first installment to all states who needed funds. For 2020-21, a provision of Rs 23,500 crore has been made for the mission.Nearly 163 million Indians lack access to clean water, the highest number for any country, according to WaterAid, a non-government organisation. According to data from the Jal Shakti ministry, in states like Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand, fewer than 5% of rural households have piped water. That compares with 99% of rural households that have piped water supply in Sikkim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-plan-to-step-up-jal-jeevan-mission-in-covid-times-centre-has-2-clear-objectives/story-tKbSzUyLYf5mAxTmjVpVIN.html

Nitish Kumar, who hasn’t stepped out of his home due to Covid-19 fear, thinks there is no harm in stepping out and vote,” he tweeted in Hindi on Sunday. देश में सबसे कम टेस्टिंग, 7-9% पॉज़िटिव केस दर और 6 हज़ार से ज़्यादा केस के बावजूद बिहार में करोना के बजाय चुनावों की चर्चा है।तीन महीनों से #Corona के डर से अपने आवास से ना निकलने वाले @Nitishkumar समझते हैं कि लोगों के घरों से निकलकर चुनाव में भाग लेने में कोई ख़तरा नहीं है।Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has been using the virtual outreach programme of his party the Janata Dal (United) or JD(U) for the build-up to the forthcoming election, when he would seek his seventh term since 2005.Though comfortably placed in the company of BJP due to Bihar’s poll arithmetic, Kumar has been out early to extol the virtues of his governance and social reforms initiatives, including prohibition and campaign against child marriage, to counter any hint of anti-incumbency factor and revive the memories of pre-2005 RJD regime of “pati-patni’ by presenting a statistical comparison on key parametres.In a series of virtual meetings, the Bihar chief minister booth-level workers and leaders to work on 90:10 formula, spending 90% time on acquainting people with the strides the state has taken since 2005 and just 10% on responding to Opposition’s meaningless clamour.“Last two assembly poll victories were due to people’s stamp of approval on Bihar government’s development work and the third one will also be no different,” he said, while interacting with workers of Samastipur, Begusaraai, Khagaria, Bhagalpur, Banka, Munger, Lakhisarai, Sheikhpura and Jamui.Kumar has also asked the workers of his Janata Dal (United) to ramp up social media presence with a special focus on first-time voters.Creating WhatsApp groups and Facebook pages, which could serve as an interface between the party and the masses, figured among the commandments received by JD(U) foot soldiers from Kumar during the six-day “virtual sammelan (conference)” that ended on Friday.Kishor has been constantly targeting Kumar over various issues, particularly those related to the Covid-19 situation in the state. Last week, he asked the chief minister to announce in public if the state government has received Rs 1.25 lakh crore aid from the Centre.He was expelled from the JD(U) by Nitish Kumar in January this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-than-6-000-covid-19-cases-but-bihar-discussing-elections-prashant-kishor-s-jibe-at-nitish-kumar/story-j6vfUFcvSGxmkDEWko9dzI.html

In a strongly-worded order passed on June 12, the court said that use of derogatory terms like “Kalla” or “negro” to address black people of African-origin is highly offensive and acceptable.Taking strong exception to the police force normalising everyday racism, the court said that black people deserve dignity and respect in foreign land and police officials should be immediately sensitised about the issue.“The Director General of Police, Punjab is requested to consider the entire issue and notify instructions in this regard to the police force calling upon them never to use the offensive term ‘nigro’ or ‘negro’ while referring to “black” persons in case papers”, justice Rajiv Narain Raina ordered during the hearing related to a drug case.The matter has been listed for further hearing on June 18 when the court will consider the limited aspect of the action proposed to be taken by the police to address this issue.“This aspect needs to be corrected by sanction of the law by ordering strict action against the policemen who indulge in this character assassination based on physical features”, the court said.The Punjab police had used the term ‘nigro’ while referring to an African person in the challan papers presented before the trial court while filing the charge sheet in a case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.“I am appalled to find the term ‘Nigro’ used while referring to an African national in the challan papers…This is a highly offensive word across the globe and no one has any business to use it, and much less the police. The police appear to have assumed that every black is a drug peddler and should be treated as such. This is terrible thinking”, justice Raina said in his order.There have been many instances of racism against African people in India in the recent past.Former West Indies captain Darren Sammy recently revealed that he faced racial comments while playing for the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He alleged that he was called ‘Kalu’ by some of his team mates during the 2013 and 2014 seasons.“I just learnt what that kalu meant when I played for Sunrisers in the IPL. They called me and Perera (Sri Lankan cricketer Thisara Perera) by that name. I thought it meant strong Stallion. My previous post tells me something different and I am angry,” Sammy’s post on Instagram read.Many people from African countries have also been subject to racist attacks in the national capital, Delhi over the past few years.The Punjab and Haryana HC said that despite (India) being a “sub-continent of browns in all its shades, we display a perverted and primitive mind-set of looking down on others.”“We are, professedly, a tolerant sub-continent of “browns” in all its shades, but more often than not, display a perverted and primitive mind-set looking down on others without looking within ourselves. For many centuries we have been slaves. Freedom does not lend its wings to our countrymen to fly anywhere they wish and in any manner they like and abuse foreigners on the street calling them ‘kalla’”, the Punjab and Haryana high court said.The court also said that black people should be referred to only by their country of origin in case papers.“All Africans are our friends and when they come to India either as visitors or students they are our valuable guests and we should be reminded that India is rich in its traditions of ‘mehman nawazi’ and ‘attithi sanskar/satkar’ and prides itself on this”, the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unacceptable-hc-rebukes-punjab-police-for-using-nigro-to-address-africans/story-HVCqZ8JsLRjH9PRfTEAhRO.html

China too has expressed wish to resolve this issue via talks. I’d like to inform Opposition that our government won’t keep anyone in the dark,” Singh said while addressing the ‘Jammu Jan Samvad rally’ via video-conferencing.“I assure you that we won’t compromise with national pride in any situation,” he added.His comments came a day after Army chief General MM Naravane said that disengagement of Indian and Chinese forces is taking place in a “phased manner” along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).“I would like to assure everyone that the situation along our border with China is under control,” said General Naravane.“Both sides are disengaging in a phased manner. We have started from the north, from the area of the Galwan river, where a lot of disengagement has taken place,” he had further said.The disengagement began after a meeting between Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the People’s Liberation Army in South Xinjiang region, on June 6.Army delegations from India and China, led by major general-rank officers, on Friday held discussions in eastern Ladakh to resolve the standoff between the border troops. This was the fifth meeting between the two major generals to break the stalemate that began with a violent confrontation between rival patrols near Pangong Tso on the night of May 5.Also read: Decoding China’s playbook | HT EditorialLast month’s violent confrontation triggered a military build-up on both sides of the LAC that stretched from Ladakh to Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.The Opposition parties had attacked the government with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi leading the charge. He had questioned if the Chinese troops have entered Indian territory. Rajnath Singh had replied to his commentd, with a stinging attack on the Congress party.Later, the Trinamool Congress also attacked the government on the LAC standoff. Abhishek Banerjee, the nephew of chief minister Mamata Banerjee and TMC’s youth wing chief, asked Union minister Amit Shah if the Chinese have occupied the Indian territory. The tweet was ahead of Shah’s virtual address to the people of West Bengal where he stung the state government on issues related to political violence, corruption, politics of appeasement, politicisation of people’s welfare and other administrative failures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/won-t-keep-anyone-in-dark-rajnath-singh-s-swipe-at-opposition-over-lac-tension/story-NXhMzvAuZhM6Gwqi7g0ZnJ.html
14-06-2020||India||‘Fate of J&K will change’: In Rajnath Singh’s address, a hint on PoK||The fate and picture of Jammu and Kashmir will change in the years to come under PM Modi’s leadership, defence minister Rajnath Singh said while addressing the ‘Jammu Jan Samvad rally’ via video conferencing on Sunday. The minister said that, under PM Modi’s leadership, Jammu and Kashmir will touch great heights and “people from the Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) will wish they were part of India”. “Just wait, soon people of PoK will demand that they want to be with India and not under the rule of Pakistan, and the day this happens, a goal of our Parliament will also be accomplished,” he said. The minister said that earlier in Kashmir, protests demanding ‘Kashmir azaadi’ were held and flags of Pakistan and ISIS were seen. “Now only Indian flag is seen there,” he said. #WATCH Just wait, soon people of Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) will demand that they want to be with India & not under the rule of Pakistan, and the day this happens, a goal of our Parliament will also be accomplished: Defence Mini Rajnath Singh at 'Jammu Jan Samvad rally' pic.twitter.com/kQUtV2CanP“Many landmark decisions were taken under PM Modi’s leadership and the abrogation of Article 370 was one of them,” Singh said. The defence minister talked in detail about the abrogation of Article 370 and described the move in tune with the development and progress of Jammu and Kashmir. He said that the development of the region is among the top priorities of the Modi government. “Our promise as a party back in the days of Jan Sangha was fulfilled right after we formed the government with a thumping majority last year. Article 370 and 35A were removed within 100 days of forming government at the Centre,” Singh stated.Singh said that PM Modi has bolstered India’s footing internationally. Global powers respect and laud the country, he said. “Earlier, at international platforms, most countries used to side with Pakistan over the matter of Kashmir and Article 370, that isn’t the case now,” Singh noted. Singh’s Jammu Jan Samvad virtual rally follows a series of virtual addresses by Union home minister Amit Shah in the past couple of weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fate-of-j-k-will-change-in-rajnath-singh-s-address-a-hint-on-pok/story-8gYgJN7W35QqSAAueBDijK.html
14-06-2020||India||SC refuses to stay Himachal police probe against Vinod Dua in sedition case, seeks status report||The Supreme Court on Sunday sought the response of the Himachal Pradesh and central governments in a plea by journalist Vinod Dua seeking quashing of the first information report (FIR) registered against him in the state in connection with a video uploaded by him on YouTube criticising the Centre’s implementation of the Covid-19 lockdown.A three-judge bench headed by justice UU Lalit, which held a special sitting to hear Dua’s plea, granted him protection from arrest till July 6—the next date of hearing in the case.However, the bench which also comprised justice M Shantanagoudar and justice Vineet Saran, allowed the Himachal Pradesh police to continue with the probe turning down Dua’s plea for a stay on FIR.The top court ordered Dua to cooperate with the investigation and said that the police will have the liberty to interrogate him at his residence in Delhi after giving a 24-hour notice.Vikas Singh, Dua’s counsel, vehemently pressed for a stay on the FIR stating that allowing the probe to continue in a flimsy case like this one will send wrong signals.Dua has been charged with grave offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including sedition (section 124A), public nuisance (section 268), printing defamatory matter (section 501) and intent to cause public mischief based (section 505) on a complaint filed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ajay Shyam.The March 30 video, Dua submitted, critically analyses the failure of the government of India regarding the declaration of nationwide lockdown and the manner in which the same was implemented.“If this kind of content can attract sedition, then half the country will be committing sedition. If what he has said is sedition, then only two (news) channels will work in this country,” Singh said.The court, however, refused to stay the probe but sought a status report from the police regarding the probe.A team of police from Himachal Pradesh had landed at Dua’s house on June 12 for serving a notice requiring his presence at Kumarsain Police Station in the state at 10am on June 13 for an investigation into FIR registered against him on May 6 for the contentious video.Dua had approached the Supreme Court on Saturday submitting that he was shocked to see the police of Himachal Pradesh at his doorstep.“The petitioner (Dua) suspects that all efforts are being made to somehow arrest him. Any arrest at this point of time, (on the) basis such frivolous FIRs would not only be a blatant infringement on the rights of the Petitioner but will also endanger his life due to the high risk to the health of people from the COVID-19 virus,” his petition said.The Delhi Police had also registered an FIR against Dua on June 4 for his March 30 video. That FIR was, however, stayed by Delhi High Court on June 10.“The petitioner also made a reference (in the video) to the politicization of the army’s attack in response to the Pulwama Attack and usage of the same in the last elections. There was nothing in the video which could be remotely termed to be criminal,” his lawyer had argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-refuses-to-stay-himachal-police-probe-against-vinod-dua-in-sedition-case-seeks-status-report/story-13hF1bFM53TDIbB4JBbdKJ.html

The Bharatiya Janata Party fulfilled its decade-old promise by abrogating Article 370 and is committed to the development and growth Jammu and Kashmir, he said.The minister said that the prime minister took a timely decision by implementing the Covid-19 lockdown in the country at a time when some of the greatest countries, like the US, were struggling with the menace of coronavirus. “Even the World Health Organisation has lauded PM Modi’s leadership amid these trying times,” he said, adding that entire country has followed the nationwide coronavirus lockdown in a disciplined manner. The defence minister talked about Jammu and Kashmir and said that the development of the region is among the top priorities of the Modi government. “In the years to come, the fate and the picture of Jammu and Kashmir will change. People from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) will make the demand, will wish they were part of India,” the minister said. Singh said in the six years of Modi government, nearly 2 lakh crore rupees have been spent on the development of Jammu and Kashmir.Singh’s Jammu Jan Samvad virtual rally follows a series of virtual addresses by Union home minister Amit Shah in the past couple of weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-leadership-amid-covid-19-crisis-is-being-lauded-across-globe-rajnath-singh-during-jammu-jan-samvad-rally/story-ah5URzmJ4KiLcSmw3RkoUJ.html

Rawat gave the directions while evaluating the pandemic situation in the state during a meeting with all the 13 district magistrates through a video conference. The Himalayan state reported 21 Covid-19 related deaths with 1,759 patients till Saturday evening. Only one of these 21 deaths has been attributed directly to Covid-19, according to health officials.“Every Covid-19 related death will be audited along with a thorough analysis of the reasons behind the death. Also, if a patient dies only after 24 hours of testing positive, then it would be considered that there was some laxity in the surveillance,” Rawat said. During the evaluation meeting, he expressed his concerns over some reports of protests by people in certain places of the state against cremating those who died of Covid-19 at crematoriums in their area. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“It is really unfortunate that there have been some incidents where people have protested against the cremation of people who died of Covid-19, fearing it would spread the infection,” Rawat said.“It is not true because the cremation of such bodies are done as per the Centre’s guidelines on the same under which the body is first sanitised. It is then put in a sanitised bag or cloth and then taken for cremation by trained people and not the family members to ensure the infection doesn’t spread,” he said.“I humbly request the people to allow respectful cremation of the deceased and not create any problem in it.”The chief minister also directed officials to resume the working of electric crematoriums in Haldwani and Haridwar apart from announcing a new one in Dehradun. Rawat, while taking cognizance of an alleged suicide by a 19-year-old man in a Dehradun-based quarantine centre on Friday, suspended the nodal officer and the doctor responsible for monitoring the quarantine centre. The man from Jabalpur had allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself inside the quarantine centre. No suicide note was found from the spot and reasons behind his suicide is not known.It was found during a probe that he was recruited as an AC assistant in the Indian Railways in Jabalpur and was in Baroda during the lockdown. He last spoke to his family members on June 2 and didn’t inform them about going to Dehradun. “Primarily it has been found that the officials who were responsible for the quarantine centre, were at fault in the incident. Hence, I ordered their suspension with immediate effect and initiated an inquiry into the whole incident,” said Rawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-to-audit-every-covid-19-related-death-cm-trivendra-singh-rawat/story-XbBSZM2PQLK4cZy0wyfdXO.html

14-06-2020||India||Congress hits out at govt, seeks cash transfers||The Congress on Saturday attacked the government and demanded lower fuel prices, injection of cash into the economy while questioning India’s China policy.“If GOI [the government of India] doesn’t inject cash to start the economy now: 1. The poor will be decimated. 2. The middle class will become the new poor. 3. Crony capitalists will own the entire country,” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet. Gandhi has maintained that the government needs to offer cash transfers for the poor to tide over the Covid-19 crisis. The Congress, which has been critical of the Centre’s Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus announced last month saying it was not enough, on Saturday pointed out the government has increased central excise duty on petrol and diesel by 258% and 819% since it came to power in May 2014.Former Union minister and Congress leader Kapil Sibal said even as the international crude prices are lowest in 15 years, oil prices are skyrocketing and the common people continue to suffer. He pointed out over the past 11 months, the government has gained Rs 1.6 lakh crore. “Together with Rs 39,000 crore in annual revenues gained from the March 14 excise duty hike of Rs 3 per litre each on petrol and diesel, the government stands to gain as much as Rs 2 lakh crore,” Sibal said.He said instead of passing the benefit of lower crude prices to the common people, oil prices have been increased for the seventh day on Saturday. Another Congress leader, Ahmed Patel, questioned the government’s China policy in the wake of the standoff between Indian and Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh. “Since 1947, [Narendra] Modiji is the only Prime Minister who made 9 official visits to China...Despite numerous visits by the incumbent PM we have this situation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-hits-out-at-govt-seeks-cash-transfers/story-LK1LsVo6kZoH8CzzDAdJEM.html
14-06-2020||India||Maharashtra records spike of over 3,000 Covid-19 cases; Mumbai worst affected||A day after it breached the 100,000 mark, Maharashtra on Saturday reported its third highest single-day spike of 3,427 new coronavirus disease cases, taking the tally to 104,568. The death toll in the state has reached 3,830. Mumbai, the worst affected Indian city, saw 1,380 new infections and 69 more deaths taking the tally of the cases to 56,831 and deaths to 2113. The city accounted for 63.73% of the state’s new cases on May 14, 56.47% on May 28 and 49.06% on June 4. This percentage dropped further to 39.10% on Friday. While Mumbai has been able to restrict the virus spread to some extent, a spike in the caseload in rural parts of the state and districts like Solapur, Aurangabad, Yavatmal, Jalgaon remains a cause of concern for the administration. The district administrations have been directed to focus on the containment by ramping up the health infrastructure. “We are implementing Dharavi pattern in districts like Aurangabad to bring mortality rate down and effective tracing of the patients. Thermal scanners and oximeters are being aggressively used in these districts that have witnessed a rising caseload. Asha workers and other health workers are being roped in to form surveillance squads for tracing and testing,” said Dr Sadhana Tayade, director, health services.The state authorities have also directed the Mumbai corporation for the immediate acquisition of beds in private hospitals. This has come after the Central government on Thursday expressed concerns over the high mortality rate and pointed at the possibility of the shortage of the ICU beds in a few districts and cities of Maharashtra.“Barring Mumbai, we have been able to cope with the demand for ICU beds required for patients. While acquiring additional stock of ventilators, we have also asked the district authorities to trace the vulnerable patients early so that they would not need to be put on ventilators,” said an official from the state government. Meanwhile, state health minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday said that the government has reduced the rates of the Covid-19 tests conducted by private laboratories from ~4,500 to ~2,200.“~2,200 will be charged for collecting the swabs through viral transport media (VTM) from hospitals, while it would cost ~2,800 for collection of swab from home. Earlier, the charges were ~4,500 and ~5,200 respectively,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-records-spike-of-over-3-000-covid-19-cases-mumbai-worst-affected/story-7oi8wKjEbaY9Pw8wvbyWrK.html
14-06-2020||India||Govt issues advisory to revive urban transport amid Covid-19 pandemic||The Centre has issued an advisory to states with measures to revive urban transport amid the coronavirus disease pandemic. The states have been asked to encourage and revive non-motorised transport, recommence public transport by adopting the right sanitization, containment and social distancing measures and utilize technology to curb the spread of virus through contact-less payment and common mobility card.“Covid-19 pandemic has suddenly impacted our way of life and that of our local, regional and global transport systems. Evidence shows that there is a steep drop in public transport ridership volumes by 90%,” the advisory said.The advisory issued by the ministry of housing and urban affairs on Friday has provided a three-pronged strategy to states.The advisory suggests non-motorised transport (NMT) for trips under five kilometres. “As most of the urban trips are clocked in under five kilometres, NMT offers perfect opportunity to implement in this COVID 19 crisis as it requires low cost, less human resource, easy & quick to implement, scalable and environment friendly,” it said.Public places will need to become more suited for pedestrians and walking and cycling networks will need to be expanded, the ministry had said earlier.“They need to demonstrate it in Delhi, where urban development is directly under the Centre’s control,” said KT Ravindran, former chairman of Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-issues-advisory-to-revive-urban-transport-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-xphMJGMyzyJ6T1CSKWeshJ.html

14-06-2020||India||Rain brings down temperature; monsoon on time, says IMD||After four days of uncomfortable heat—a mix of high temperature and humidity—Delhi received light rain in some parts on Friday and Saturday. India Meteorological Department scientists are hoping the monsoon will arrive on its normal date around June 27 in Delhi as it has already reached parts of Bihar in the east and is likely to reach Gujarat in the west in a day.“It rained in different parts of the city, including Lodhi Road on Saturday. On Friday, there was light rainfall in north Delhi. This is happening because of a combination of factors. There is a cyclonic circulation over Delhi and Haryana and a trough, or a line of low pressure, stretching from Punjab to Odisha. There are moist easterly winds. We can expect some light rainfall in the next couple of days also,” Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, said. “Monsoon is likely to arrive in Delhi around June 27 after crossing east and west UP,” he added.The monsoon has advanced into Madhya Maharashtra, most parts of Marathwada and Vidarbha, parts of Chhattisgarh, all of Odisha and West Bengal and most parts of Jharkhand and Bihar according to IMD’s Saturday bulletin. Conditions are becoming favourable for the further advance of the monsoon into all of central Arabian Sea, some parts of North Arabian Sea, the remaining parts of Maharashtra including Mumbai some more parts of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar and even some parts of south Gujarat by Sunday.“The monsoon has strengthened because of the low-pressure system which developed over the Bay of Bengal. By next week, it will enter Gujarat, covering many parts of central India. This system has helped the monsoon move at its pace. It’s too early for us to tell if it will arrive over Delhi on its normal date, June 27,” K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-brings-down-temperature-monsoon-on-time-says-imd/story-HEJc54jzxN1adaq2xot7rI.html
14-06-2020||India||Masks can reduce Covid-19 growth rate by 40%: Study||Masks can reduce the growth rate of coronavirus infection by 40%, a paper on the impact of the staggered use of masks in public places in different cities and municipalities in Germany has found.After the city of Jena made it mandatory on April 6 to wear masks, new confirmed Covid-19 infections reduced by 25% compared to that in a group with similar demographics, local health care systems and pre-April Covid-19 levels, the analysis found. The findings were released on Friday. “Depending on the region we analyse, we found that face masks reduced the cumulative number of registered Covid-19 cases between 2.3% and 13% over a period of 10 days after they became compulsory. Assessing the credibility of the various estimates, we conclude that face masks reduce the daily growth rate of reported infections by around 40%,” said the discussion paper by IZA Institute of Labor Economics in Bonn, Germany.The long incubation period of the Covid-19 infection, among other factors, contribute to its spread, according to experts. Symptoms appear on average after four to five days of getting infected, according to a study published in March in The Annals of Internal Medicine. In this period, patients might not develop symptoms of cough, fever or difficulty in breathing, but can spread the infection.Several studies have also found that Covid-19 is also spread by those who have a very mild disease but do not show symptoms.A paper published in New England Journal of Medicine on Friday, which followed asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship that saw an outbreak in February, found that the majority of asymptomatic cases did not develop symptoms at all throughout the course of the infection.People with advancing age, hypertension and diabetes were pre-symptomatic for longer, it found. “This important study clarifies many facts. People develop symptoms in an average of four days, and a large proportion of Covid-19 positive patients (58%) are asymptomatic throughout the duration of illness, which ranges from three to 21 days, with the median period being nine days. The study also found that asymptomatic patients transmit infection throughout the duration of illness,” said Prof GC Khilnani, chairman, pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine, PSRI, and the former head of the pulmonology department at Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences.At least 28% of 40,184 people who tested positive for Covid-19 between January 22 and April 30 in India were asymptomatic, according to an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) study. Wearing masks in public is already compulsory or recommended for all in several countries, including India, Singapore, France, Spain, Germany and Argentina, among others. A study in The Lancet on June 2 said social distancing, masks and hand hygiene do not offer complete protection on their own.“As the lockdown lifts and people become mobile, social distancing, wearing masks and hand washing are the only defence against Covid-19 till we get an effective vaccine or cure,” said Dr Ambarish Dutta, associate professor of epidemiology and public health, Indian Institute of Public Health, Bhubaneswar.The World Health Organization (WHO) updated its guidelines for countries earlier this month and advised “governments to encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments”.Two days later, the global health agency was forced to retract a statement by its coronavirus lead, Maria Van Kerkhove, who said asymptomatic transmissions were “very rare”. It triggered a global debate and led sceptics to use the remark to discredit mandatory masks and social distancing policies. WHO clarified that much remains unknown about asymptomatic transmission. “Most transmissions seem to occur from those with symptoms. However, we have to be careful because people can be infectious one to two days before they develop symptoms. So right now it is important for everyone to wear face coverings when they cannot maintain physical distancing,” said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist, WHO, Geneva.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/masks-can-reduce-covid-19-growth-rate-by-40-study/story-x3AY1QMIPvBthiertbzCZJ.html
14-06-2020||India||Can politics shape revival of economy after Covid-19?||India’s GDP will not reach 2019-20 levels until 2021-22 according to World Bank projections. There will be immense economic pain in the days to come. The impact will vary for different stakeholders in the economy. Both policy and politics will have an important role to play in recovery. The first part of this series, which was published on June 13, argued that states with higher non-farm, non-government share in the economy will suffer more. It also argued for collecting more data to come up with an informed policy response.What about politics? The Indian economy is entering a contraction phase after a prolonged slowdown. Resources of both businesses and government were already stressed. India’s policy response will also be an exercise in distributing very scarce resources across practically unlimited demands. In a democratic set-up, politics can be used to influence policy in the interests of the majority by collective mobilization. The agriculture sector is expected to show positive growth despite the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. This does not guarantee a rise in farm incomes. Mass incomes outside the farm sector will drop in a big way due to economic contraction. This is bound to affect purchasing power, and eventually, food demand.India’s farmers have very little bargaining power when it comes to prices. Anecdotal accounts of crops being abandoned due to price crashes are quite common. A collapse in food prices due to poor demand cannot be ruled out. Real agricultural growth figures will not capture this development. This is because it discounts for price changes. Nominal growth statistics will have to be observed carefully. The Indian economy suffered a phase of collapse in nominal agricultural growth in the period before the 2019 general elections.This created large scale farm distress and anger. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) paid heavily for it. It lost the crucial assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in 2018. A policy correction followed. Direct cash transfers of ₹6,000 per year were announced under the PM-KISAN scheme. The government announced the Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for the 2020-21 kharif season earlier this month. The MSP hike for paddy, the main kharif crop, is the lowest in 10 years. The MSP for paddy has increased 2.9% from Rs 1,815 per quintal last year to Rs 1,868 per quintal. The last time the hike was lower than this was in 2010-11, when the MSP was not increased at all. These are nominal price comparisons, as real MSP for 2020-21 requires inflation data for the entire year. Holding back on MSPs at a time of weaker demand is bound to generate headwinds for farm incomes. But this will save resources for the government. Whether or not this changes will depend on agrarian mobilizations. Caste is an important political fault line in India. Economic fortunes follow caste hierarchies. Many political parties claim to represent the interests of socially backward caste groups. Reservation in government jobs is one of their key demands. This is not surprising. Government jobs are better paying and secure. Historical discrimination has led to under-representation of the Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and Other Backward Class (OBC) workers in government jobs. The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data for 2018-19 shows this. Of the total jobs in the government, local body, and public sector enterprises sector in 2018-19, 33.2% were held by workers who were not from SC-ST or OBC communities. Their share in the total workforce was 26.3%. This implies their share in government jobs was 1.27 times that in the Indian workforce. This relative share in government jobs was 1.03 for SC workers, 0.82 for ST workers, and 0.87 for OBC workers. In normal times, prioritizing the rhetoric around reservations is justified. It promises upward mobility in the future. However, there is merit in recalibrating this strategy going forward.Politics, during a recession, should be about protecting current jobs and incomes rather than eying future gains. PLFS data shows that the share of SC-ST and OBC workers in regular jobs (which offer reservations) is significantly lower than that of upper castes. It makes sense for parties representing the interests of these groups to focus more on demanding relief in sectors and areas for where their base is currently employed. Social justice rhetoric should focus more on the vulnerabilities in private sector, especially casual workers and self-employment, than reservation. Reverse migration due to the lockdown is among the most important economic consequences of the pandemic. The 2016-17 Economic Survey, an annual publication of the ministry of finance, says that domestic remittances serve 10% of households in rural India. (See Chart 2) In remittance receiving households, they financed over 30% of consumption. These incomes will have to be revived in order to restore growth. Offering alternative employment opportunities in villages can at best be a palliative. Ultimately, migrant workers will have to be encouraged to return. Politics can play a role in this. An overwhelming majority of migrant workers are not unionized at their work place. They have very little bargaining power vis-à-vis employers. Being outsiders also makes them more vulnerable to the apathy of the local administrations. However, there is reason to believe that these workers are closely linked with each other by their place of migration. Workers returning in groups to their native places are the biggest proof of this. Political actors in their home states could use this opportunity to protect their interests. State governments could be pressured to defend the interests of migrant workers. This could take the form of organizing better transport facilities for their return. It could include extracting guarantees of better working conditions or social security, such as a ration card upon arrival, from the governments of states where they work. May be, there is some merit in demanding that migrant workers be allowed to vote in their home states, even if they are working outside. The 2016-17 Economic Survey gave a list of top 31 labour-importing and 73 labour-exporting districts in India. These places could be the epicentres of a new form of trade unionism in India.

14-06-2020||India||Delhi details plans to use hotels in Covid-19 war||The Delhi government is preparing for a surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases and plans to use a total of 40 hotels and 77 banquet halls as makeshift hospitals, a move that is expected to add over 15,800 beds to the city-state’s health care infrastructure, according to documents seen by HT. On Saturday, two top hotels in South Delhi, Vasant Continental and Hyatt Regency, were asked to place rooms at the disposal of the hospitals they were being attached to. Authorities plan to set up 11,229 beds in 77 banquet halls, which will function under the Delhi government, and 4,628 beds in 40 hotels, which will be supervised by private hospitals, a list released on Friday night showed. On May 29, the Delhi government identified the first five hotels in the first-of-its kind move in the country and issued an order to this effect.“Today (Saturday), all district magistrates were asked to submit the time they will take to set up such facilities. The aim is to get the hotels and banquet halls readied within a week,” a senior government official said on the condition of anonymity.Patients opting for the hotel facility, which is primarily for those with moderate symptoms, will have to pay a minimum of Rs 63,000 a week if it’s a three- or four-star hotel. If it’s a five-star hotel, the weekly charge will go up to at least Rs 70,000. In addition, patients needing oxygen support will have to pay Rs 2,000 a day. The charges will vary with medical investigations, which private hospitals overseeing these facilities will bill at their own rates, and the duration of treatment.The Delhi government move came against the backdrop of a spike in Covid-19 cases; the national capital added 2,134 new cases on Saturday to end the day with a total of 38,958 infections (22,742 of them active) and 1,271 fatalities. At present, Delhi’s bed capacity across private and government hospitals for Covid-19 patients stands at 9,698. Of them, 4,248 are vacant, according to Delhi’s coronavirus app dashboard. Between Monday and Saturday, Delhi has added 9,015 cases.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Wednesday that the city will need 150,000 beds by the end of July as he accepted Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal’s order overruling his government’s decision allowing only Delhi residents to be treated in government and private hospitals. And on June 7, while Kejriwal announced the reopening of malls, dine-in restaurants and places of worship after two-and-a-half months, he said hotels and banquet halls will continue to be closed as they will be used to augment the city’s health care infrastructure. Meanwhile, L-G Baijal, who is the chairperson of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority, directed government officials to immediately start scouting for banquet halls, hotels and stadiums to increase the city’s bed capacity.Of the 11 districts in Delhi, Northwest District will have the maximum banquet halls (21) that will be turned into Covid-19 hospitals. West District will have the maximum such hotels (12).The list of hotels include Maidens Hotel of the Oberoi Group in Civil Lines (supervised by Sant Parmanand Hospital); Hyatt Regency in Bikaji Cama Place (Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj); Park Inn by Radisson in Lajpat Nagar (Moolchand hospital); Hotel Ramada in Pitampura (Jaipur Golden Hospital); and Holiday Inn in Mayur Vihar (Apollo Hospital). The five hotels in the May 29 order were Crowne Plaza (Batra Hospital); Hotel Surya (Apollo); Hotel Siddharth (BL Kapur Memorial Hospital); Hotel Jivitesh (Sir Gangaram Hospital); and Sheraton Saket (Max Super Speciality Hospital)Officials in Apollo Hospitals, which will supervise five hotels, pointed to the challenges. “We reached out to two hotels, but they said they will let us start only after the judgment of the high court…We have not been able to do a recce,” a hospital official said, requesting anonymity.On June 4, CHL Ltd, which owns and runs Surya hotel, approached the Delhi HC against the state government’s May 29 order directing five luxury hotels, including Surya and Crowne Plaza, to be converted into hospitals. The hotels argued that the government took the decision unilaterally and that they were not consulted.The court directed on Thursday a committee of two doctors --- All India Institute of Medical Sciences director Randeep Guleria and NITI Aayog member VK Paul --- to check the plan’s feasibility. The matter will now be heard on Monday (June 15).An official in Max Hospital, who asked not to be named, said work at Sheraton Hotels in South Delhi’s Saket was complete. Max is supervising four hotels. “We are treating several patients at Sheraton, which was among the first five hotels…However, we too have not been able to extend our services to the other hotels because they are all awaiting the court verdict,” said the official.The Delhi government is setting up health care facilities on its own at the banquets. The fee structure for a banquet-turned-hospital was not immediately available.“All these facilities will have separate entry and exit points. A tender has already been floated for cots. The water and electricity bills that will be generated in these banquet halls/hospitals will be paid by the health department from its funds. The medical equipment and the staff will be arranged by the health department,” said a second government official.The Delhi Medical Association, which is holding regular meetings with the state government to discuss bed augmentation plans, said the city-state’s administration has approached it for medical staff, including nurses.“Nursing associations are also being reached out, but manpower is going to be a serious challenge,” said Dr Girish Tyagi, president of the association.As for stadiums, the government plans to set up 2,500 beds at Pragati Maidan and 200 beds at Talkatora, emulating Maharashtra. “But stadiums need more medical engineering...We are first going with hotels and banquet halls, which are easier and quicker because their structure resembles that of hospitals; there are rooms and washrooms,” said an official in the health department who did not want to be named.Dr Lalit Kant, the former head of epidemiology and communicable disease at Indian Council of Medical Research, said such arrangements should have been done by now. “…all that needs to be done is ramping up of health infrastructure as soon as possible. However, simultaneously, it is also very important to ensure strict enforcement of civic rules such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/capital-details-plans-to-use-hotels-in-covid-war/story-X5EGyoHFIZvkhfEFGY3XqI.html
14-06-2020||India||500-year-old Odisha temple submerged under Mahanadi river reappears||A 500-year-old ancient temple of Lord Vishnu that was submerged in Odisha’s Mahanadi river sometime in 19th century due to change of course of the river, has resurfaced after 15 years.An archaeological survey team from the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage that visited the village in Nayagarh district, said the top of the Gopinath Dev temple was visible due to the reduction in the water-level of the river.Anil Dhir, project coordinator, Mahanadi Project (INTACH), said the top of the submerged temple was discovered in the mid-river near Baideswar in the Padmavati area near Nayagarh district. “The 60-ft tall submerged temple dates back to late 15th or early 16th century, considering the construction style of the Mastaka and the materials used for the construction. It is made of sandstone and among the oldest temples that have been submerged in Mahanadi,” said Dhir.The 60-ft temple made of sandstone belongs to Lord Gopinath, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. The temple used to be visible frequently 15 years ago, but due to release of water at Mundali barrage the temple was not visible to fishermen. In the last one and half years, INTACH team led by Dhir has documented submergence of 65 such temples in Mahanadi river that runs through much of western Odisha before draining into Bay of Bengal.“Whatever heritage has been submerged, we are documenting it. People already knew there was a shrine submerged in the river, but it had not resurfaced in years,” said Dhir.Sometime in the middle of the 19th century, the Gopinath Dev temple as well as the village named Padmabati was located submerged when Mahanadi River changed its course after 1933 flood. “The village was submerged under the waters and the villagers moved to higher places to set up a new village renamed as Padmabati. However, the deity of the temple was taken by the villagers and installed in another temple in their present village,” said heritage enthusiast Rabindra Rana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/500-year-old-odisha-temple-submerged-under-mahanadi-river-reappears/story-BsxxeXvRdIZu9IygGVlkEM.html
14-06-2020||India||116 districts to start re-skilling migrant labourers||The Skill Development ministry has zeroed in on 116 districts of the country to re-skill migrant labourers who have returned to their home states. The ministry is trying to make district-specific plans for migrant labourers, a key aspect of which involves identifying their current skills and re-skilling them according to the needs of the job market.A letter written by the Skill Development ministry to the district collectors and district magistrates mentions that the Covid-19 has created an unprecedented social and economic disruption leading to large-scale reverse migration. “This migration is likely to cause a lot of stress on the local economy and society which is already under considerable stress due to COVID-19,” says the letter by KC Gupta, Joint Secretary in the ministry to various district chiefs.The said that “district specific” plans will be created to create sustainable livelihood opportunities in the identified districts under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana and the Apprenticeship scheme. The ministry plans to hold short-term training as well as recognition of prior learning programmes in the next four months to give direction to its initiatives.“The Centre and state are in cognizance of the massive reverse migration that has happened in the country and are working jointly to ensure opportunities of better livelihood for them by engaging them in local economic activities. Under the guidance of the Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi, our ministry is working in close conjunction with other central ministries the state governments and related organisations to map the existing skills of these migrant labourers basis a certain framework provided by us and future skills that will be in market demand. We are certain this exercise will connect the right workforce with the right work profile,” Skill Development minister Mahendra Nath Pandey said.In the letter, Gupta sought the support of the district administrations to identify migrant labourers and do skill mapping, job role identification for fresh skilling and surveys of eligible enterprises for proving apprenticeship at the district level.“The government is trying to move with a focused approach therefore 116 districts have been identified. However, based on the need the number could be further increased. Several flagship programmes of the government, around 15 in all, have been aligned to meet the needs of migrants and job aspirants in the COVID-affected scenario. The skill development ministry can play a key role in this regard,” said the official cited above.According to information accessed by HT, around 32 districts of Bihar, including East Champaran, Katihar, Madhubani, around 20 from Uttar Pradesh and 20 each from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are among districts that have been identified as most-affected due to the high reverse migration.The government had earlier formed an empowered group that looked into these aspects. A group of ministers had also suggested a slew of measures including bringing a National Employment Policy as part of its suggestion to help the migrants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/116-districts-to-start-re-skilling-labourers/story-L8gyRqND3t15kuWveglEhK.html
14-06-2020||India||Govt approves remdesivir for moderate Covid-19 cases, HCQ early on||The health ministry on Saturday recommended the use of antiviral drug remdesivir in the moderate stage of Covid-19 while changing its earlier stance on hydroxychloroquine, saying the anti-malarial drug should be used only in the early course of the disease and not on critically ill patients.Convalescent plasma therapy has also received approval for off label use. This involves transfusion of the plasma of recovered individuals into Covid-19 patients. “…may be considered in patients with moderate disease who are not improving (oxygen requirement is progressively increasing) despite use of steroids,” says the health ministry protocol.Also read: Delhi details plans to use hotels in Covid-19 warThese changes are part of the revised clinical management protocol for the disease released on Saturday by the Union health ministry. The revised guidelines say HCQ should be given early on in the course of the disease for maximum benefit and should not be given to severely ill patients. The earlier protocol recommended HCQ for critically-ill patients in the intensive care unit.The antibiotic, azithromycin, that was being given in combination with HCQ has been dropped, even as some precautions have been added to make the use of the latter safer. ”... this drug should be used as early in the disease course as possible to achieve any meaningful effects and should be avoided in patients with severe disease. An ECG should ideally be done before prescribing the drug…” say the updated recommendations. A government official, a domain expert who asked not to be named, said the evidence against the use of HCQ is not compelling enough to withdraw its use. The expert added that decisions are made on the basis of available evidence. “If tomorrow, we get more robust evidence for or against any medicine, then the experts concerned will take a call accordingly.” As part of investigational therapies, the new treatment protocol also includes immunosuppressant drug tocilizumab (off label).Also read: 15 cities with rising Covid-19 cases have emerged as new areas of concernDr Yatin Mehta, the head of Medanta Hospital’s critical care department said: “These antivirals have shown promise against Sars-Cov-2 [which causes the disease] in initial studies and tocilizumab blocks the cytokine storm that starts building inside the body after a week or so. However, there are certain contraindications in the use of these medicines. So the medicine is not for everyone and needs to be started under strict medical supervision.” Dr Vanshree Singh, director (blood bank), Indian Red Cross Society, said: “Plasma therapy has shown promise but not all patients will benefit from it, which is why there is a separate protocol for administration of plasma therapy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-approves-remdesivir-for-moderate-cases-hcq-early-on/story-3OQL3X6VP3nAbupB32P4pJ.html
14-06-2020||India||Two terrorists killed in Jammu & Kashmir’s Kulgam gunfight||Two terrorists were on Saturday killed in an exchange of fire with security forces at Niapora Zadoora in Jammu & Kashmir’s Kulgam district amid an escalation in violence in the region, police said and added the firefight was triggered after an operation was launched following a specific input about the terrorist presence there.As many as 16 terrorists have been killed in Kashmir since Sunday last. Unidentified assailants also shot dead a village council head and two civilians believed to be working for the security forces. As many as 90 militants have been killed in Kashmir since January, according to the Jammu & Kashmir police.The two killed in Niapora Zadoora are believed to have been affiliated with the Hizbul Mujahideen group even as their identities were not immediately revealed. The police said the terrorists were given opportunity to surrender during a search operation before the firefight. They added instead the holed up terrorists fired and lobbed grenades on the joint search party and triggered the gunbattle. “On a specific input about the presence of terrorists in village Nipora Zadoora, Kulgam, a joint cordon and search operation was launched by [Jammu & Kashmir] Police, 19 RR [Rashtriya Rifles] and 18 Bn [battalion] CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force] in the village,” the police said in a statement. “During the search operation, the terrorists were given opportunity to surrender, however instead they fired and lobbed grenades upon the joint search party, which was retaliated leading to an encounter in which the two terrorists were killed.”It said the security forces conducted the operation professionally and there was no collateral damage. Two pistols and three hand grenades were also recovered from the gunbattle scene.A group of terrorists escaped during a cordon and search operation in the neighbouring Tral area after a separate operation was launched on Saturday, people aware of the matter said without giving more information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-terrorists-killed-in-j-k-s-kulgam-gunfight/story-SJZDwwOo4KyH5coSqfR0MK.html
14-06-2020||India||Social distancing, no parents at IMA passing-out parade||A batch of 423 young officers graduated from the Indian Military Academy (IMA) in Dehradun on Saturday, but parents were not allowed for their passing-out parade in a departure from practice due to restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Instead, the academy’s staff and instructors, and their wives placed stars on the uniform of the Gentlemen Cadets after their oath ceremony as a mark of them being commissioned in the army --- an honour usually reserved for friends and family. Wearing masks, 333 officers from India and 90 from friendly foreign nations took part in the event at IMA grounds. The event was live-streamed on YouTube.As the event started around 7pm, the Gentlemen Cadets maintained social distancing during their ceremonial parade. Flower petals from helicopters were not showered, another departure from practice. The newly commissioned officers did not get leaves to visit their homes before joining their units due to the pandemic situation, according to IMA officials. They will join their units straight out of the academy. “Obviously, it felt bad that my parents couldn’t see me wearing the officer’s uniform despite living in the same city. But then, it is for the safety of all. We are thankful to our instructors at the academy who played the role of our parents and made us realise once again that we all are one big family,” said Abhishek Negi, 22, a newly commissioned officer from Dehradun.Samrat Thapa, 22, a Bhopal resident, said his father, a Colonel in the Indian Army, wanted to see him passing out of the academy. “Unfortunately, due to obvious reasons, he couldn’t come… he cried over the phone when I called him after the ceremony,” Thapa said. Sumati Gakhar, the wife of an Indian Army officer who put stars on the uniform of Gentlemen Cadets, said: “I felt extremely proud while putting the stars on the shoulders of these young officers along with my husband.”Saturday’s event also witnessed a significant change with the introduction of ‘pahla Kadam’, or the first step. Lt Col Amit Dagar, the public relations officer, IMA, said earlier there was the “antim pag”, or the last step after the parade, which symbolised the conclusion of training. He added that this season authorities introduced the “pahla kadam”, or the first step, after the “antim pag” to denote the beginning of the new journey of the officers.IMA, which is one of the most prestigious training institutes of the Indian Army, was established in 1932 under the British rule. At the academy, Gentleman Cadets are trained to be commissioned as officers in the army, along with students from friendly foreign countries. With Saturday’s passing out parade, the academy has trained a total of 62,561 Gentlemen Cadets, including 60,059 from India and 2,502 from foreign countries. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/social-distancing-no-parents-at-ima-passing-out-parade/story-NFQ0FZs8iVStF5oAPHyyKJ.html
14-06-2020||India||Loss of smell, taste added as symptoms of coronavirus disease||The Union health ministry has revised its clinical management protocol for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to include the loss of the sense of smell and taste along with fever, cough, sore throat and shortness of breath as symptoms, while also adding that children may not be reporting fever and cough as frequently as adults. Muscle pain, diarrhoea, expectoration (coughing up phlegm), and fatigue have also been added to the protocol released on Saturday.HT reported on Thursday that the government was considering the revision to include loss of smell and taste as the symptoms for diagnosis and testing of the disease.“Older people and immune-suppressed patients, in particular, may present with atypical symptoms such as fatigue, reduced alertness, reduced mobility, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, delirium, and absence of fever. Children might not have reported fever or cough as frequently as adults,” says the revised document released on Saturday. A health ministry official underlined Covid-19 is a new disease and fresh information on it keeps emerging daily. “The ministry is constantly reviewing the evidence, both nationally and globally, to update its protocols. The current one is being released today [Saturday] based on the latest information available on the disease,” said the official, who did not wish to be named.The first Covid-19 testing criteria was fixed in January and included symptoms such as fever, cough, and breathlessness. In May, gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhoea or vomiting were also added to the list. Until the revision, there were 13 clinical symptoms and signs in the specimen referral form and included fever, cough, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, breathlessness, nausea, haemoptysis (coughing up of blood), body ache, sore throat, chest pain, nasal discharge and sputum. Any patient with one or more symptoms was to get tested for Covid-19. In April and May, the World Health Organization, some European countries, the US, and Australia, added loss of smell and taste as one of the key Covid-19 symptoms. An article published in the medical journal Lancet last week said the prevalence of loss of smell and taste was three-fold higher in individuals testing positive (65.03%) than in those testing negative (21·71%), for the disease suggesting that people with such symptoms should self-isolate.Experts here have been asking for updating the clinical features for some time.“The move by the ministry of health is in the right direction. There is growing concern among the public about asymptomatic people. Among the asymptomatic, a major subgroup comprises people who might be having atypical symptoms such as loss of smell, taste and weakness. Earlier these were not fitting the case definition of Covid-19, and therefore were not tested… with this expansion... we can prevent the spread aggressively…,” said Dr Giridhara Babu, the life course epidemiology head at the Indian Institute of Public Health, Public Health Foundation of India.Dr GC Khilnani, a pulmonologist, said a number of people have been reporting to hospital emergencies with non-specific symptoms such as loss of smell and taste, and diarrhoea etc. “So it [the revision] makes sense to include these [symptoms] also.”The revised document has also underlined certain risk factors that include age (over 60) and underlying non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiac disease, chronic lung, cerebro-vascular, chronic kidney diseases, immune-suppression and cancer.“This category will need extra care, and if it is managed well then in the long run, we will be able to bring down the death rate even further,” said Dr Khilnani.India’s case fatality rate is currently 2.86% as compared to the global 5.5%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/loss-of-smell-taste-added-as-symptoms/story-pPIFlyvnrIKfqWduK0mAAK.html
14-06-2020||India||PM Modi, Amit Shah meet officials to review Covid-19 response||The Covid-19 situation in Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Thane, Ahmedabad and Indore, all hotspots of the viral pandemic, was in focus during an extended review meeting attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, health minister Harsh Vardhan, Niti Aayog member Vinod Paul, and key officials in charge of the various empowered groups managing various facets of India’s response to the pandemic. Shah will meet with Kejriwal to discuss the situation in Delhi on Sunday. On Saturday, Delhi added 2134 new cases, the second highest number of cases it has added in a 24-hour period (the highest was on Friday, 2,137) and Chennai, 1989, the highest the city has added in a day. Mumbai, Thane, Ahmedabad, and Indore are also hotspots. ”60-70% of the cases are confined to these cities and their containment strategies need to be reviewed,’’ said the member of an empowered group present at the meeting and who asked not to be identified. A second official present in the meeting said on condition of anonymity that discussions at the meeting also focused on the states where these cities are located falling behind on testing and contact tracing, and not ensuring strict adherence to social distancing norms. It as decided that senior central ministers would reach out to each of the states to discuss this, the official added. For instance, recent days (and weeks) have seen a spate of media reports about the crowds and lack of social distancing at Chennai’s Madhavaram fruit market, bringing back memories of the crowds at the city’s Koyambedu market responsible for a sharp spike. The Prime Minister is to meet with chief ministers on June 16 and 17, with the second day reserved for meetings with the chief ministers of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and a few other states that are seeing a sharp rise in the number of cases. On Saturday, for instance, Delhi, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu alone accounted for 7550 of the 12,081 new cases recorded in the country. A statement from the Prime Minister’s office said: “In view of the challenges being faced, particularly by the large cities, it was discussed to augment testing as well as the number of beds and services to effectively handle the peak surge of daily cases. Prime Minister took cognizance of the recommendations of the Empowered group and instructed Health ministry officials to undertake emergency planning in consultations with states/UTs.’’The second official said that despite the spike in cases “nobody should be feeling helpless.” “We have already increased testing from the 2,000 that we started out with to around 1.5 lakh tests daily and we will ramp it up further.’’The ministry of health and the empowered groups on hospitals and availability of essential supplies has already submitted their projected figures of the rise of cases and the need for medical infrastructure till August. There isn;t a shortage of essential medical supplies, the second official added, but the government is worried about a number of reports about paucity of hospital beds in the worst affected cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-shah-meet-officials-to-review-covid-response/story-FJYco5wUXAjVaIF77aDdEK.html
14-06-2020||India||Covid-19 toll crosses 9,000-mark with 1,000 deaths in 3 days||Coronavirus deaths in India crossed 9,000 on Saturday, with the country adding the last 1,000 deaths in three days.Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi account for roughly two-thirds of all deaths in India, which recorded an average of 377 deaths every day over the past week.On Saturday, the death toll touched 9,196, having crossed 8,000 on June 10 and 7,000 on June 3. With 321,405 cases as on Saturday night, India’s case fatality rate is 2.9%, compared to the world’s 5.5%.In all, India’s Covid-19 toll has increased by at least 6,000 in less than four weeks, with total deaths crossing the 3,000 mark on May 18. The toll in India touched 1,000 on April 28, 47 days after the first Covid-19 death was confirmed in Hyderabad on March 12.Over the past 24 hours, 7,135 Covid-19 patients have been cured and returned home , taking the recovery rate is 49.95%, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare data. The number of recovered patients continues to remain more than the number of those with infections, 162,271 to 149,938. “I think mortality per million population is a much better metric to judge how Covid-19 has affected us. The case fatality rate can change depending on the denominator of the number of people who are tested and turn out to be positive,” said Amit Singh, associate professor at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.With the number of cases rising rapidly following the easing of restrictions, experts say the focus must be on preventing deaths. “To reduce the number of deaths, cities and states have look at the number of people being hospitalised. If that number shoots up, then the beds and ventilators will be occupied, leading to more deaths. So wherever the number of hospitalizations is going up, the local governments need to implement lockdown measures. By unlocking at a time when the number of cases and hospitalizations are rising, we are doing more harm than good,” said Singh.Where lockdowns are not an option, the next best thing is to use personal protection measures such as face masks, frequent handwashing and maintaining social distancing of at least 2 metres, experts say.“Reducing the exposure of the vulnerable, which includes the elderly, people with co-morbidities, and pregnant women should be done as much as possible. My mother is 90 (years old), I wear a mask even at home. Young people have to step out to work, but they must take precautions to stay safe so they don’t expose older people at home to infection, which can potentially kill them,” said Dr Dileep Mavalankar, director, Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar, Gujarat.Gujarat has the second highest number of deaths after Maharashtra, and is among the five cities -- along with Mumbai, Delhi, Thane and Chennai -- that account for close to half of the Covid-19 cases in the country. The state’s case fatality rate, at 6.3%, is also the highest in India.“The hotspots have begun shifting to newer areas and in Ahmedabad, new infections are going down in the central-south zones such as Dariapur, Shahpur, Danilimda, Jamalpur, and Saraspur, among others. Only sero-surveillance data from the hotspots will indicate whether it’s (because of) herd immunity or whether the virus has exhausted susceptible people in these wards, which is leading to a reduction in cases and deaths.” said Dr Mavalankar.Sero-surveillance is simply blood tests conducted to test for the antibodies to the virus that causes the disease. Their presence indicates past infection and, more importantly, immunity. A multi-city sero-surveillance being conducted by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to estimate the fraction of the population that has past exposure to Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, in containment zones is ongoing.The results of the population-based serosurvey in districts with zero cases and low, medium and high incidence released by ICMR on Friday said 0.73% of the population had been infected with Sars-CoV2, which indicates that a large proportion of the country’s population is still susceptible to infection. Still, this survey was conducted in early May, a month when India added at least 150,000 new cases. Health ministry data on Saturday said 885 labs have been approved to test for Covid, of which 642 government labs do free testing, and 243 private labs charge a maximum of Rs 4,500. Testing in the past 24 hours reached 143,737, taking the total number of samples tested to 5.5 million to date, which translates into a little over 4200 tests per million population. “Testing is an important component of surveillance and guides contract tracing, isolation and treatment. It also shows where response efforts need to be directed to combat the disease. India has been calibrating its testing strategy as per the changing situation, taking into account scope, need and capacity. With increased testing, the trajectory of positive cases will go up – but it will also help in better preparedness and response,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, World Health Organisation South East Asia Regional Office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-toll-crosses-9k-mark-with-1-000-deaths-in-3-days/story-FrvX6wKrfmNFRHTipAB7oL.html

He allegedly raped the child and killed her by strangulating her. The girl’s father said he returned home from a nearby village around 9pm after taking part in the preparations for a relative’s wedding and noticed his daughter was missing. “I asked my wife; she said her distant uncle (the accused) had taken her to get some sweets. After waiting for some time, we launched a search and managed to find him He later confessed to killing her and dumping the body in a field,” the father added.A first information report (FIR) was filed on the complaint of the victim’s father, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-held-for-minor-s-rape-murder/story-Datwj12L056Vb9DArOnTFO.html
14-06-2020||India||Nepal okays map tweak, India calls it ‘untenable’||Nepal’s Parliament on Saturday passed a constitutional amendment to give legal backing to a map depicting disputed areas such as Lipulekh as Nepalese territory, prompting India to say such “artificial enlargement of claims” violates an understanding to resolve boundary issues through talks.On Saturday afternoon, the House of Representatives or lower house of Nepal’s Parliament unanimously adopted the constitutional amendment bill for including the country’s new political map in the national emblem. This map, cleared by the KP Sharma Oli government on May 20, depicts Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepal.All 258 members of the 275-strong House of Representatives present in the lower house voted for the bill. The ruling Nepal Communist Party doesn’t have a two-thirds majority in the lower house, and the bill was supported by key opposition parties such as Nepali Congress and Rastriya Prajatantra Party.The bill is set to be taken up by the National Assembly or upper house next week, people familiar with developments said. The Nepal Communist Party has a two-thirds majority in the upper house and the bill’s passage by the National Assembly is considered a formality.Reacting to the development, the external affairs ministry – which has said in the past that the matter should be resolved through talks – described the passage of the bill as an “artificial enlargement” of Nepal’s territorial claims.“We have noted that the House of Representatives of Nepal has passed a constitution amendment bill for changing the map of Nepal to include parts of Indian territory. We have already made our position clear on this matter,” said external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava.He added, “This artificial enlargement of claims is not based on historical fact or evidence and is not tenable. It is also violative of our current understanding to hold talks on outstanding boundary issues.”Nepal’s Speaker Agni Sapkota was quoted by The Kathmandu Post as saying: “All 258 lawmakers present in the meeting voted for the bill, while there was no vote against it. I announce that the bill has been endorsed by more than a two-thirds majority.”When the Nepal government presented the bill in the lower house on Tuesday for discussion, it was unanimously backed by lawmakers from all political parties. After being passed by the upper house, the bill will have to be signed by the president to come into effect.Nepal’s move to issue the new political map was triggered by India’s inauguration of an 80-km road to Lipulekh on the border with Tibet to facilitate the movement of pilgrims going to the Kailash Mansarovar site. Last year, Nepal had been irked when India depicted Kalapani as part of a new map of the union territory of Ladakh.Nepalese officials claim they made three proposals to India for talks since last November, with the most recent one in May, but that there was no response from the Indian side. Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has maintained that Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura are part of his country’s territory on the basis of the Treaty of Sugauli signed with the British in 1816, which says all areas east of the Kali river belong to Nepal.Oli has also accused India of creating an “artificial” boundary in the region and of encroaching on Nepalese territory by deploying the army.India has dismissed these claims, saying they are not based on historical facts and records.Hours before the lower house of Nepal’s Parliament voted on the amendment, Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane emphasised the strong relations between the two countries. The remarks marked a U-turn from his earlier comments about Nepal working at someone else’s behest to raise the border issue.“We have a very strong relationship with Nepal. We have geographical, cultural, historical, religious linkages. We have very strong people-to-people connect. Our relation with them has always been strong and will remain strong in the future,” Naravane told reporters.The India-Nepal border row comes at a time when India is engaged in a tense stand-off with Chinese troops in several sections of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and Constantino Xavier of Brookings India said it was time for New Delhi to move towards de-escalation with Kathmandu.“India spent too many years wasting scarce resources on micro-managing Nepal politics. Useless, counter-productive. Delhi can’t be petty. Ignore symbolic amendment. Olis will come and go. Move on, focus on de-escalation, delivery,” Xavier tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-okays-map-tweak-india-calls-it-untenable/story-VnVPb8CSvGpJHyTo0ykrrK.html
14-06-2020||India||Studies reveal impact of Sars-CoV-2 virus on all levels of nervous system||A review of over 50 studies published on June 11 has revealed that the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) affects almost every level of the nervous system and may lead to strokes, seizures and muscular pains in people who catch the infection.Some Covid-19 patients may exhibit mild symptoms like headache, dizziness, reduced alertness, difficulty in concentrating and disorders of smell and taste, according to the review that comes at a time when India is considering adding the sudden loss of smell and taste to the list of Covid-19 symptoms, such as fever and shortness of breath, to watch out for. Based on previous experience with coronaviruses, Sars-CoV-2 could impact the nervous system in three ways: by direct invasion, by consequence of other medical conditions such as stroke, and post-infection diseases such as the Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a disorder of the immune system, according to the review published in the journal Annals of Neurology.Other diseases caused by coronaviruses, including the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers), led to few cases with neurological symptoms. Those two viruses affected 10,500 people. By Saturday, June 13, Covid-19, which first manifested itself in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of 2019, had affected at least 7 million people worldwide.“Head ache, dizziness, disturbance of smell and taste, difficulties with memory can occur before any other respiratory symptoms. This is very important since those people should be tested for Sars-CoV-2 and if positive, they should be isolated and their contacts should be traced to avoid spread of the virus in their family and community.,” said the lead author of the review, Dr Igor Koralnik, professor of neurology at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. “It appears likely that this should also be the case in India, but it is possible that physicians focus on the respiratory disease first and that neurological manifestations are not recorded systematically. It is also possible that different viral strains affect people in India compared to those in the rest of the world or the different ethnic background of the population may affect the spectrum of neurological manifestations of Covid-19. Whether this is the case in India has to be determined through systematic analysis.”Respiratory distress is still considered to be a defining symptom of Covid-19. “Several ongoing studies in Italy are finding strong evidence that this virus can affect the peripheral nervous system (sensory), but in some patients, who already have a weak system, it can affect the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and affect their cognition and memory,” said Dr Ramesh K Mishra, professor and head of the Centre for Neural and Cognitive Sciences (CNCS) at the University of Hyderabad, who reviewed the study.More studies are needed on the cognitive consequences of those who survive the infection, Mishra said. “There have been cases of cognitive degenerative disorders previously in HIV and Ebola, but only a few cases. It is because these patients live long now that these have been observed.”Mishra cited a study conducted in Wuhan and published in JAMA Neurology, a peer-reviewed medical journal, that found nervous system symptoms in 36% of 214 Covid-19 patients in three hospitals. “The Northwestern University researchers are basing their review around it because they themselves have not done much. They are telling the government that the neuro team should be on high alert. That should be our aim also,” he said.“Serious neurological manifestation is stroke, which is rare,” said Dr Gagandeep Singh, head of the department of neurology at Dayanand Medical College & Hospital in Ludhiana, and secretary of the Indian Academy of Neurology.In India, such cases have been reported from Chennai and Delhi. “We are currently pooling in anonymised data on the occurrence of stroke in Covid-19 patients,” Dr Singh said.The ACE receptors, to which Sars-Cov-2 locks on to enter and infect human cells, are also present in the brain and blood vessels, which become inflamed, leading to endotheliitis, or inflammation in the inner walls of the arteries, said Dr Rajinder K Dhamija, head of the neurology department at the Lady Hardinge Medical College & Hospital in Delhi.“This may form clots that can lead to stroke,” Dr Dhamija said. “There is literature to show that Covid-19 is beyond cough and fever. We should proactively probe the history of the patient.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/studies-reveal-impact-of-virus-on-all-levels-of-nervous-system/story-2Lhzo4PYMx30SKS8ToF9hJ.html
14-06-2020||India||Nepal parliament clears new map, shuts possibility of talks on boundary row||Nepal’s lower house on Saturday cleared a constitutional amendment bill to reflect its new map in the national emblem, a move that is seen to virtually make the boundary row a permanent irritant in relations between Kathmandu and New Delhi. The bill was supported by all the 258 lawmakers present and voting.The passage of the bill, which consolidates Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s standing within and without the ruling Communist Party of Nepal, came on a day hundreds of protesters hit the streets of capital Kathmandu over his government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.India’s response to Saturday’s development was curt and pointedly shut the door on any possibility of talks.“ We have noted that the House of Representatives of Nepal has passed a constitution amendment bill for changing the map of Nepal to include parts of Indian territory. We have already made our position clear on this matter,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.“This artificial enlargement of claims is not based on historical fact or evidence and is not tenable. It is also violative of our current understanding to hold talks on outstanding boundary issues,” he said.Also Read: Why PM Oli rejected India’s offer for dialogueAt the four-hour-long discussion in the House of Representatives that preceded the vote, PM Oli was asked by several lawmakers to take the next steps to reclaim control of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura from India. Some others from the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) favoured continuing with some of the border restrictions on movement of people that have been introduced due to Covid-19 to continue, according to local media portal eKantipur.To be sure, the Oli government, which had gone ahead to issue the new map last month, has repeatedly claimed that Nepal would “get back the land occupied by India” through dialogue. Nepal has already asked India to convene a foreign secretary-level meeting to discuss the boundary row.Also Read: In 4 sentences, Army chief hints India’s approach to Nepal after map rowOfficials told Hindustan Times that Nepal had precluded the option of dialogue to resolve differences over Lipulekh since it had already gone ahead to formalise the new map.India will, however, continue to focus on strengthening people-to-people contact.Army chief General MM Naravane had also hinted at this approach earlier on Saturday when he sidestepped a question on the row over the map, preferring to focus on relations between the people of the two countries.“We have a very strong relationship with Nepal. We have geographical, cultural, historical, religious linkages. We have very strong people-to-people connect. Our relation with them has always been strong and will remain strong in the future,” General Naravane said.Gen Naranave was the first top Indian official to go public with his assessment that Nepal’s loud protests over the 80-km road to Lipulekh pass built for Kailash Mansarovar pilgrims were probably at the behest of “someone else”. That veiled reference to China’s influence over the Oli government had riled PM Oli, particularly given that he had been trying to build a narrative that he was a strong prime minister who was standing up to its giant neighbour India.Officials said the army general had echoed the assessment in New Delhi that found the timing of Kathmandu’s shrill protests over a road close to Nepal’s northwestern tri-junction with India and China particularly suspect.Around the time that General Naravane made the statement, China had mobilised troops along the Line of Actual Control to set off a standoff with Indian soldiers at four locations in eastern Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-parliament-clears-new-map-shuts-possibility-of-talks-on-boundary-row/story-HV6CttOxVQulY5edtKtigO.html
14-06-2020||India||‘Hope all perceived differences between India, China will be set to rest’: Army chief||The entire situation along our border with China is under control and there have been significant disengagements from both sides in the area near Galwan river in Ladakh, said Chief of Army Staff General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Saturday in Dehradun. General Naravane made the statement while interacting with media persons at the Passing Out Parade (POP) of Indian Military Academy (IMA) Dehradun where he attended the ceremonial event as a reviewing officer of the POP. “I would like to assure everyone that the entire situation with our border with China is under control,” said General Naravane.Also read: As Nepal preps to vote on new map, a hint about India’s stance from Army chiefHe said, “We are having a series of talks which started on June 6 followed up by a number of meetings at the local level between commanders of equivalent ranks. As a result of this, a lot of disengagements have taken place in the region and we are hopeful that through this continued dialogues, the perceived differences between us would be put to rest.”On the standoff majorly in the Galwan river area and Pangong Tso lake between India Army and China’s People’s Liberation Army, he said, “Both sides are disengaging in a phased manner starting from the north in the Galwan river area where a lot of disengagements have happened. We have a fruitful dialogue which will continue and the situation will keep improving as we go on.”He, however, didn’t say anything on the standoff at Pangong Lake area. On the recent border issues at the Nepal border, General Naravane said, “As far as Nepal is concerned, we have a very strong relationship with them including strong people-to-people connect, geographical, cultural and historical linkages. Our relation with them has always been strong and will always be strong.”He also spoke on the recent anti-terrorist operations in Jammu and Kashmir in the last few days. “We had a lot of success in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir where in the last 10 days, at least 15 terrorists have been killed. All these operations happened with inputs from locals which shows that they are also fed up with this terrorism and militancy, and want the situation to get normal as soon as possible,” he said. Earlier during the POP, total 424 Gentleman Cadets (GC)s passed out as army officers. The GCs include 333 from India and 90 from friendly foreign countries. Amid Covid-19 pandemic, this time the academy implemented certain precautionary measures including wearing of facemasks by the GCs and maintaining extra distance during the parade. Also, considering the health safety of the GCs and IMA staffers, the family members of the GCs were not allowed to witness their wards passing out as army officers, which happened for the first time in the history of the IMA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hope-all-perceived-differences-between-india-china-will-be-set-to-rest-army-chief/story-u1eG4Mfgke0SLrZXzaqtwI.html
14-06-2020||India||Economic impact of Covid-19 pandemic to vary in sectors||If the Indian economy were a person, her income in 2020-21 and 2021-22 would be less than what it was in 2019-20. At least, this is what the latest World Bank forecasts tell us. There is enormous, perhaps unprecedented, economic pain ahead. Both policy and politics will have to play an important role to alleviate this. Bad policy can delay, even derail economic revival. Good politics can ensure that the suffering of the masses is minimized. What can be done to ensure this?A three-part series in these pages looked at the nature of economic challenge facing India in detail. Its main argument was that India needs a demand-side intervention. But Indian economy is both huge and diverse. The policy response will have to be mindful of this diversity. Only then can suitable measures be applied where they are needed. Policy, especially in times of crisis, is also a question of distributing scarce resources among competing needs. In a democracy, politics influences this process in a big way. This two-part series tries to address these questions. The first part will highlight how the contraction in growth will not be uniform across regions and sectors. The second part will discuss possible avenues of political mobilization.Earlier this week, the World Bank released its Global Economic Prospects report. It expects India’s gross domestic product (GDP) to contract by 3.2% in 2020-21. There will be a moderate recovery to 3.1% growth in 2021-22. This means that 2021-22 GDP will be less than what it was in 2019-20. To be sure, India is not the only country which will face this predicament. The East Asian region seems to be the only exception. (See Chart 1)What does a contraction in GDP mean in real life? Incomes will drop. Jobs will be lost. However, the impact of the contraction will vary across sectors, states, even social groups. This knowledge is indispensible for an effective policy intervention. For example, it can be expected that at least two sectors; agriculture and government, will not see a contraction. In 2019-20, these two sectors had a share of almost 30% in total Gross Value Added (GVA). This means that the economic pain will be far more severe in the rest of the economy.Let us assume that the growth rate of agriculture and government sectors in the next two years will be the simple average of what they were in the past three years. This comes to 4.1% for agriculture and 9.7% for government. Using the World Bank’s headline projections of 3.2% contraction in 2020-21 and 3.1% growth in 2021-22, we can calculate the projected growth for rest of the economy. This comes to a 7.2% contraction in 2020-21 and 1.4% growth in 2021-22.The non-farm, non-government economy contains many sub-sectors. A contraction in each sub-sector will have different impact across states and jobs. For example, the non-farm, non-government sector had a share of 86% in Gross State Value Added (GSVA) for Delhi. This share was 56% for Madhya Pradesh, and only 38% for Arunachal Pradesh. This means that Delhi’s economic pain will be far more severe than Arunachal Pradesh’s. (See Chart 2)What about employment? A contraction in some sectors can have a bigger impact on jobs than others. For example, construction had a share of 8% in GVA in 2018-19. But its employment share, according to the 2018-19 Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), was 12%. Financial services, real estate and professional services, on the other hand, had a GVA share of 22% in 2018-19. The employment share of this sector was only 3.4%. This means that construction is a more labour-intensive sector than finance. So, for an equal value of loss in output, job losses in construction would be far higher than in the financial sector. Bailing out the construction sector can save a lot of jobs, and mostly of the poor. Supporting finance will probably cushion the not-so-poor, and the sectors which depend on their demand. A useful way to measure job losses during a contraction is by using what is referred to as employment elasticity of output in economics. It is equal to the change in number of jobs per unit change in economic output. The concept captures the idea that for the same amount of growth, job creation varies across sectors. This also means that job losses during a contraction phase will vary across sectors. A comparison of year-on-year growth in GVA and jobs in 2018-19 shows that the construction sector and the trade, hotels, transport, storage and communication sector had the highest employment elasticity in the non-farm, non-government sector. (See Chart 3)Which states or sectors to support is not the only policy question going forward. There will also be a choice in terms of supporting producers and consumers. For instance, according to the Annual Survey of Industry (ASI) data, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Maharashtra had a share of 45% in value of output of textile and apparel in 2011-12. This output was consumed across the country. An analysis of the 2011-12 Consumption Expenditure Survey shows that Uttar Pradesh and Bihar had a share of 19.9% in total consumer expenditure on clothing and bedding. These two states had a share of just 3.9% in value of output of textile and wearing apparel. If consumer demand does not revive in these two states, supporting textile manufacturers will not yield results. (See Chart 4)There is a major blind spot for policymakers in tracking consumption trends. India does not have a consumption expenditure survey (CES) after 2011-12. This will be a decade-old in 2021-22. The 2017-18 CES findings were junked by the government.After the 2008 financial crisis, there was a lot of uncertainty about job losses. India did not have high-frequency employment data. The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government asked the Labour Bureau to start tracking quarterly employment-unemployment  rates. Today, the PLFS does collect employment data in each quarter of the year. However, the government has not been releasing the quarterly data regularly. The 2018-19 findings were released only earlier this month. It will also be a good idea to start collecting and publishing high-frequency data on consumption. Unless, there is more and better high-frequency data on the state of the economy, policy intervention will continue to be ill-informed. If the surveys show bad news, so be it. We are officially in a recession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/economic-impact-of-covid-19-pandemic-to-vary-in-sectors/story-DIWjwnBZoON7ZUvgSMSFOL.html

14-06-2020||Editorials||Monsoon will bring a set of health challenges||The southwest monsoon hit the coast of Kerala, its first port of call, on time. As it now segues into the hinterland, the monsoon will also bring with it health challenges such as malaria, dengue and leptospirosis. This year, containing these illnesses will be more difficult due to the coronavirus pandemic, which could affect the operationalisation of the standard operating procedure (SOP) that governments follow to keep other diseases under control. The SOP — fogging, desilting of drains, checking houses for stagnant water and public outreach on protocols related to these illnesses — could be hampered because the front line staff — heath officials and sanitation workers — is busy tackling Covid-19; there is also pressure on resources. The monsoon ailments, however, affect hundreds of people every year, and the season for these illnesses is getting extended due to the climate crisis. For example, in 2019, Mumbai witnessed a surge in dengue cases in November due to unprecedented rains. This year, the problem is further complicated because the symptoms (fever, sore throat and body ache) of Covid-19, dengue and malaria, and a few other diseases such as typhoid and common flu overlap. If patient are infected with one of them, doctors will have to test them for a particular ailment and, if found negative, will have to do a Covid-19 test. This will burden the testing infrastructure. India cannot afford to have another health crisis and more non-Covid-19 patients in hospitals. Governments will have to do their best to identify manpower and resources for following prevention guidelines. Citizens must be careful and take precautions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/monsoon-will-bring-a-set-of-health-challenges/story-2BoRweDxWrEdmXpFeB1QML.html
