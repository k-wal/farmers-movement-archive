27-06-2020||News||Remembering the life and times of Sam Manekshaw | Opinion||On the 12th anniversary of his death on June 27, the nation would do well to remember the extraordinary life and times of the legendary army chief Sam Manekshaw.I remember an incident in December 1971, which underscores the rapport the army chief had with his men and his indomitable valour. Such a long time ago but not long enough for me to forget even an hour of those days. I was then a lieutenant colonel commanding the 5/8 Gorkha Rifles, which belonged to Sam Manekshaw’s regiment, the 8 Gorkha Rifles. He was proudly referred by the soldiers as Sam Bahadur.We were deployed in the Chhamb sector where the most ferocious fighting of the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war took place. While the operations against the Pakistan army in East Bengal (now Bangladesh) were launched by the Indian Army after Pakistan’s atrocities against the Bengalis in East Bengal and everyone’s attention was on it, Pakistan launched a pre-emptive attack in the Western Theatre in Chhamb.By now, it was a full blown war. Pakistan had some initial successes due to the surprise factor and overran the brigade defending Chhamb. By this time, the Indian Army had reacted and deployed the 68 Brigade to defend the line of Munnawar Tawi by occupying the East Bank of the Tawi. While the Tawi was not deep and the infantry could wade through it in most areas, there were only two possible crossings for tanks near the Chhamb Bridge over Tawi and the other about three kilometres south opposite a village called Darh. My battalion was deployed to defend the Chhamb crossing and another battalion was deployed to defend the Darh crossing. I had already demolished the bridge.That night the Pakistanis attacked Darh with tanks and after fierce fighting they were able to establish a bridge head at Darh by the morning. While the reserve forces of our Brigade were able to prevent the bridge head from going deeper, Pakistan was rapidly building up more forces in the bridge head during the day and it was assessed that during the night they would be able to have sufficient forces to launch a thrust towards Akhnoor about 25 KM east of Chhamb where the bridge over the Jammu Tawi was located. Its loss would have severed the eastern part of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) from India and enabled Pakistan to attack Jammu from the rear, thus cutting off J & K from India.Consequently the divisional commander ordered me to launch a counter-attack supported by a squadron of T-72 tanks of the 7/2 Armed Regiment. I launched the counter-attack soon after sundown in the darkness and after very fierce fighting and heavy casualties on both sides we succeeded and drove the Pakistani forces back across the Tawi. The progress of our action was being monitored by an anxious army headquarters and the chief of the army staff General Manekshaw was informed immediately. He was away at the Eastern Theatre overseeing the operations against East Bengal which led to an eventual surrender.The first thing next morning, Sam Bahadur was with us. He had come personally to compliment the soldiers for their brave action. He insisted on going right up to the forward positions. The subedar sahib cautioned that going up to the forward positions would draw enemy fire, especially if they had any inkling of who was in the field. Sam nonchalantly waved aside the objection saying: “Don’t worry, let them know that I am here. They wouldn’t want to tangle with me. In any case they are bad shots and will probably miss me.” Then striding forward he looked back at the subedar sahib and said with a twinkle in his eye. “Now, you be careful, sahib, they might get you instead.” With that, off we went to the forward positions. The Pakistani soldiers were still on the ridges above and looking down at us. For whatever reason no one fired even one shot. Throughout the light-hearted camaraderie of those hours with Sam, the men could see the steel behind those green eyes and it left them with renewed resolve and hope.Lt General AS Kalkat was army commander & former commander Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF), Sri Lanka. He is the first person in India to be awarded the Sarvottam Yudh Seva Medal, the highest award for leadership in war and conflict.

27-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai records 2,077 cases, highest in a day||The city recorded its highest single-day number of Covid-19 cases on Saturday and crossed the 2,000-mark in a day for the first time with 2,077 cases. The total number of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai has reached 74,252, as per the state government’s records. Of the 2,077 cases, 1,402 were recorded within 24 hours on Saturday, and the remaining 675 cases were reconciled. The city also recorded 105 deaths, of which 41 were recorded in the past 48 hours, and the remaining 64 were from an earlier period.“Reconciliation of Covid-19 cases from all districts and municipal corporations between the period of March 9 and June 7 has been completed. Cumulative figures for Covid-19 cases have been changed accordingly,” the state mentioned in a clarification on the change in numbers.Meanwhile, after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) launched its rapid action plan earlier this week to focus on six wards in the Mumbai suburbs, the weekly share of Covid-19 cases in these wards cumulatively increased to nearly 45% from 35% last week. The share of cases refers to the percentage of the total cases being reported across 24 wards.The six wards in the suburbs of P-North, R-Central, R-North, R South, S, and T, are corresponding to areas of Malad, Borivli, Dahisar, Kandivli, Bhandup, and Mulund. Between June 13 and 19, these wards recorded a total of 2, 951 Covid-19 cases collectively, whereas, between June 20 and 26, the collective figure was 3, 519.Civic officials said that the rise in cases is a good sign and reflects increased testing. Vishwas Shankarwar, deputy municipal commissioner of Zone 7, which covers Borivli, Dahisar, Bhandup, and Malad, said, “The rapid action plan is on the right track. The idea is to detect more cases and isolate more people.”As part of its rapid action plan that was introduced on June 22, BMC has launched mobile fever clinics in ambulances in these areas. The mobile clinics have been directed to drive around through the day with a team of doctors who will carry out door-to-door screening of residents, check for fever and other symptoms, comorbidities, and collect swab samples. “There are five mobile clinics in every ward that are visiting high-risk areas and testing all possible cases. A team of 70-100 medical staff in every ward is going to slum areas and screening senior citizens,” said Shankarwar. Meanwhile, according to BMC data, 2,587 Covid patients recovered and were discharged on Saturday, which is the highest number of patients to be discharged in a day. Till Saturday, 42,331 patients were discharged in total.One hot spot that has shown signs of drastic improvement – Dharavi – recorded only 14 cases on Saturday, bringing the area’s total case count to 2,232.Confusion over reopening of salons, parlours in cityUncertainty still looms over opening up of barber shops, salons and beauty parlours by Sunday as the BMC is yet to issue clear guidelines on the same. Senior civic officials said that the guidelines are being worked and will be issued by Monday. A decision on opening of the shops was kept on hold for a long time by the state considering the higher possibilities of Covid transmissions here. The state government order issued late on Thursday stated that barber shops, salons and beauty parlours in 19 municipal corporations, earmarked as red zones, will open from June 28, while in the rest of the state they shall open from June 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-2-077-cases-highest-in-a-day/story-a4fOsaf0JM2fLjwZCLEqvL.html
27-06-2020||City||Gurugram: 17 found positive for Covid-19 in antigen testing conducted in Jyoti Park||Gurugram The health department on Saturday conducted rapid antigen detection tests for Covid-19 in Jyoti Park, one of the worst affected areas identified by the district administration. Of the 83 antigen tests done in the area, 17 tested positive, health officials said. The samples of those who tested positive were also collected for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, the officials said. On Saturday, people in large numbers were seen queuing up at the area’s community centre to get themselves tested. Dr Neelam, medical officer, Madanpuri urban primary health centre, said, “A team, consisting of two doctors, three lab technicians, six auxiliary nurse midwifes (ANM), three helpers and one staff nurse, has been assigned different tasks. ANMs take down the name of people who are to be tested. Such people are then taken to the sample collection booth. Since it takes 15-30 minutes for the test result, we ask people who have given samples to stand in a corner.”According to her, the 17 who tested positive were recommended home isolation. “All of them had mild symptoms, therefore they were asked to home isolate themselves,” she said. Most of the people who tested positive are from affected areas like Madanpuri, Baldev Nagar, Arjun Nagar, Lakshman Vihar, sectors 4 and 7, who reached the Jyoti Park community centre to give their nasal swabs, the officials said.Neelam said that Jyoti Park, Madanpuri and Arjun Nagar, all falling under ward 16, have reported at least 314 cases. Of which 219 patients have been discharged while 95 are hospitalised or in home isolation, she said. “If one person is infected in a family, then others get infected too. In such cases, antigen testing is a useful tool,” said Neelam.Gaurav Sharma, an employee with an electronics company, said, “After testing positive on May 18, I was suggested home isolation. I contracted the virus from my wife who was in contact with a family in the neighbourhood where nine people had tested positive. Since no health worker visited our house, I had to come for antigen test to check whether I am still positive.”The health department has been conducting antigen tests in Covid affected pockets of the city. The tests have been done in Sadar, Sohna, Gandhi Colony, Pataudi and Jyoti Park. On Saturday, 107 rapid tests were done in Badshahpur too, and all were negative. Till now, more than 500 antigen tests have been conducted and over 33 have been tested coronavirus positive.In an order issued by the district administration on Friday, to control the Covid-19 spread in affected areas, rapid testing of symptomatic person is advisable. The test has to be conducted at an exit point of the area. Also, intensive public health campaign will be conducted, including door-to-door surveillance, in the large outbreak region starting June 30, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-17-found-positive-for-covid-19-in-antigen-testing-conducted-in-jyoti-park/story-Ql2hyIWLrSi7YG2feb6RcN.html
27-06-2020||City||Paucity of staff slows Gurugram’s primary Covid testing strategy||Gurugram: With only 41 trained technicians available to carry out sampling and testing for the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, targeted collection of throat and nose swabs (for RT-PCR testing) has slowed down in Gurugram. Antigen and rapid antibody tests are now being conducted along with tests as per the district’s primary strategy, and the health department’s resources are spread thin, officials said.Data from the department shows private labs are now collecting most of the samples in the district (for confirmatory RT-PCR tests), while number of samples collected by the health department (also for RT-PCR, as part of targeted surveillance) have not significantly increased in June, despite a surge in positive cases.Chief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav, said: “Earlier, all technicians were engaged in collecting and testing swabs using RT-PCR method. Now many of them are also doing rapid antibody tests and antigen tests, which increases the workload.”Another official, requesting anonymity, revealed that there have been multiple instances when lab technicians have tested positive for Covid-19. “The technician has to isolate and seek medical help, and then return when they test negative after two weeks. When this happens, it slows down sample collection,” the official said.Collecting samples from the field, officials explained, can be a laborious process involving not just taking swab but also proper storage and transportation, and data management. “Earlier, all 41 of the health department’s technicians were engaged in collecting and testing swabs using RT-PCR method. Now many of them are also doing rapid antibody tests and antigen tests, which increases the workload. For sampling, there are 10 teams of two technicians each for RT PCR and antigen tests. The target is about 100 samples per day, per team.”However, data shows that between June 1 and June 12, the department collected only 247 samples per day (through targeted surveillance), which increased to 283 samples per day between June 16 and June 24 (an increase of about 14%). Over the past three days, with the introduction of antigen tests, this number has grown to about 350 samples per day -- less than half the target.“The increase in sample collection is not very significant when you consider that during the same period, the number of cases in Gurugram rose by almost 400%, from 903 in early June to over 4,500 by June 24. Deaths have also soared, from just three on June 1 to over 50 on June 24,” said Dheeraj Singh, a city-based data scientist who has been tracking the health department’s data. Yadav, however, responded saying the health department would soon be able to collect at least 1,500 samples daily. “We will have staff of 61 technicians soon, of which 20 new recruits will conduct antigen tests, while the remaining will collect and test samples for RT-PCR. Our aim is to collect at least 1,500 samples per day by mid-July,” he said.CONTACT TRACING ALSO AFFECTEDExperts said this trend also calls into question the efficiency of contact tracing in Gurugram. “A surge in cases, as Gurugram witnessed earlier this month, implies that many more primary contacts need to be traced and tested. Accordingly, the health department should be collecting that many more samples from people with a high ‘pre-test probability’ of being positive, which are people who have had prior contact with confirmed cases,” said Dr Prabhakaran Dorairaj, vice president (research and policy) at the Public Health Foundation of India.Thus, if the number of tests conducted through targeted surveillance isn’t increasing by a sizable margin, “It is likely that susceptible individuals aren’t being actively sought out through contact tracing. This could also be why the mortality rate in the district is going up,” Dorairaj said.Lapses in the district’s implementation of the ‘test, trace, isolate’ strategy was brought into focus earlier this week after Haryana’s additional chief secretary, Vijai Vardhan, conducted an audit of contract tracing data. A district level official with Haryana’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, seeking anonymity, said, “The audit found that in four days in June, 587 cases were detected but contact tracing for over 250 was not carried out.”An ASHA worker, who requested not to be named, detailed the logistical challenges of contact tracing. “We are asked to cover at least 15 families in a day. Since the numbers are increasing every day, it is not easy to cover all households. We have been doing this all summer, but on some days the heat was so bad that it wasn’t possible to trace all contacts of every person,” the worker said.TARGETED SURVEILLANCE NECESSARYDr Ram Prakash, district epidemiologist, clarified that targeted testing, tracing and isolation are still Gurugram’s best option to curtail further transmission of Covid-19. “We are still focused on contact tracing. Despite issues, the number of samples collected through targeted surveillance has been increasing, even if only gradually. It is not a cause for concern because we are still doing adequate RT-PCR tests, which is the most reliable diagnostic tool, with the help of private laboratories.”HT had reported on June 23 of an increase in the number of private labs conducting tests in Gurugram. Between June 16 and June 24, for example, private labs collected 61% of all samples from the district (as opposed to 41% in the preceding fortnight).Experts have cautioned against relying on private testing to make up for the slowdown. “Targeted surveillance is the best way to catch ‘super-spreaders’ who may be transmitting the infection to a sizable number of people. It is also the best way to find infected individuals before their symptoms worsen. Private testing, on the other hand, is arbitrary. It cannot be used as a substitute for contact tracing,” Dorairaj said.He and other experts also said that antigen tests, which have a low sensitivity (and yield a greater percentage of false results) rate, were not a viable replacement for RT-PCR.The CMO, however, clarified that both antigen and sero surveillance in the district were being carried out in a targeted manner in hotspot areas. “Targeted sampling is being conducted through sero surveillance and antigen detection tests. Through these tests we are focusing on specific groups of population who are susceptible to contracting the virus,” Yadav said.DATA WOESWith the district health department now pooling testing data from private and government labs and even antigen tests in its daily bulletin, experts say Gurugram’s true performance in the fight against Covid-19 is being obfuscated.“When you test randomly, like private labs are doing, you will get a lower positivity rate. But lower positivity through targeted testing is the ideal way, not by adding random samples to your testing pool,” said Rajesh Kumar, an epidemiologist and former professor of community medicine at PGIMER Chandigarh.In light of this, experts also called for a revision of the district bulletin’s format. “The data for private testing, targeted surveillance and antigen testing must be presented separately. When you club data from three separate testing strategies, we are unable to see the real picture,” said Singh, drawing attention to Gurugram’s declining test-positivity rate.“To get a correct picture of the positivity-rate, we need de-segregated numbers to show how many samples are being collected and tested via targeted RT-PCR tests,” Singh added.(with inputs from Archana Mishra)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/paucity-of-staff-slows-gurugram-s-primary-covid-testing-strategy/story-GQwgzR7TDpozOxw3HP47fK.html
27-06-2020||City||Covid has necessitated re-imagining office spaces, say corporates||Gurugram: Start-ups and companies across the board are coming to a consensus that in a post-pandemic world, workplaces would need to be re-imagined, with the possibility of work from home (WFH) becoming a permanent feature. Sharing their experiences during an online conference, ‘Redesigning the workplace: A new normal for women and young leaders’ on Saturday, representatives from different fields weighed in on work from home, among other possible options, that might redefine jobs in a post-Covid world.Deep Kalra, founder and group executive chairman of MakeMyTrip Ltd, said that the percentage of employees willing to come back to the office space for work was less than 20%, going by an internal poll conducted by the company. He said that even if 25% of the staff was called to work, they’d need to wear masks at all times, which would be an uncomfortable experience. “To work from home or not has become a great debate in current circumstances. People are more comfortable working from home. The workforce could start limping back to office gradually, but the reality is that people will fall sick due to various reasons. Till the time the virus is controlled, we have to contend with WFH protocols,” said Kalra.He added that the option of WFH could work well for those who need to travel long distances to get to work and the company was hoping to implement WFH permanently for a day or two in a week after the pandemic is over. “We should look at the positive side of things and see if these can be used to re-imagine the way we work. There are employees who come from Delhi and Noida and spend anywhere between three-four hours in transit daily. This time could be utilised towards more productive things,” said Kalra during the conference, organised by Ashoka University.Most representatives were of the view that a post-Covid would need a mix of the best practices that could include both WFH options and visits to office spaces. Sangita Reddy, the president of FICCI and the joint MD of Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited, said that productivity of employees had increased during the pandemic and such approaches to work could be implemented in the future. “It is crucial to encapsulate the best practices of the current situation in a post-Covid world. The positive outcomes of WFH need to be implemented in the future. It could open the possibility of more women continuing with work even if they were to shift cities due to various personal reasons,” said Reddy.Vinita Bali, independent director and strategy advisor, Cognizant Technology solutions, another panellist, said that the pandemic had given companies an opportunity to question the whole concept of office spaces. Huge singular office spaces could make way for multiple smaller ones, argued Bali. “We can have distributed offices where we have a large number of small offices that do not require employees to commute beyond 30-40 minutes,” said Bali.Weighing on the future possibilities for women employees, Bali said that WFH was not a panacea for the inclusion of more women in the workforce. “It is a naïve and simplistic assumption that the option of WFH would bring in more women into the workforce. The Covid-19 experience might not be a solution to the diversity issue plaguing organisations,” said Bali, adding that work from home did not necessarily offer more flexibility.Kalra also said that women were finding it more difficult to work from home than men. With boundary-less working, handling both work and families was tough, he said. “Women with children and in-laws are especially finding the option of WFH challenging. The understanding is that they are available to work all the time. Unlike men, they do not have the luxury of working uninterrupted,” he said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-has-necessitated-re-imagining-office-spaces-say-corporates/story-6SaXr0gPbK9UI1pkGXw2UK.html
27-06-2020||City||Large swarms of locusts reach Gurugram, no damage reported||Gurugram: Large swarms of desert locusts reached Gurugram Saturday morning and passed over several areas, catching residents unaware. Many locals posted videos of the hoppers flying across city skies on social media, even as they banged utensils and played music to shoo them away. Residents also warned others across the city and called for staying indoors.According to district agriculture officials, the swarm was five km wide and eight km long and before entering Gurugram from Pataudi side, it divided in four groups, and two of these entered Sector 4 and 5 and another toward Kherki Daula. They also entered but Delhi but due to wind direction, they moved towards Nuh and Faridabad, said officials. The swarms were spotted in Rajendra Park, Sector 5, MG road, Nathupur, DLF phases 2 and 3, among some other areas of the city. Residents said that crows, sparrows and pigeons could be seen flying away in large numbers from areas where the swarms were witnessed.The Gurugram administration, meanwhile, said that despite the attack, no damage was reported to crops in the districts even as the agriculture department kept a watch on developments. The swarms had entered Rewari district through Mahendergarh on Friday and as soon as this information was received, the district administration started preparations, a spokesperson of the administration said.“An awareness campaign regarding this issue was carried out in rural areas and an advisory was issued to city residents about precautions to be taken and measures to adopt, to ensure the locusts stay away. We asked residents to keep doors and windows closed and clang utensils and create noise to keep them away,” said the spokesperson.Atma Ram Godara, deputy director, agriculture, said 200 tractor trolleys with spray pumps were arranged and insecticides were distributed in rural areas to start spraying in case the locusts settle in the city or farm areas. “In rural areas like Pataudi and Farrukhnagar, even vehicles of the fire department were deployed to spray chemicals and ensure that the locusts are killed,” he said, adding that 45 officials of the agriculture department kept a strict watch on the situation.The city residents, meanwhile, said they got scared by the huge swarm of locusts that darkened the sky for some time, and forced them to stay indoors.Dinesh Vashisht, president of the RWA of sectors 4, 5 and 6, said that the swarm came from the Sector 4 side and hovered over their area for about 10 to 15 minutes. “As soon as it got there, a large number of people started clanging vessels to create noise which ensured that the locusts did not stop there but moved on. For a while, the entire sky went dark; it gave an eerie feeling to see these locusts,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/large-swarms-of-locusts-reach-gurugram-no-damage-reported/story-WOFhbkjfC75aLZDhumIFcM.html

The civic authority is still assessing the hot spots along with the police department and will issue lockdown orders on Monday.On Saturday, Thane city recorded 371 new cases and 14 deaths, the highest single-day numbers to date. Thane has a total of 7,827 cases and 263 deaths.“The entire city won’t be under lockdown. However, we are planning to impose a complete lockdown in areas which are hot spots for Covid cases. These areas will be assessed at ward level, along with the help of police department. The list will be finalised on Monday, and we will issue lockdown orders accordingly,” said Sandeep Malvi, deputy commissioner, TMC.Malvi stressed that essential services will continue to be operational, but the movement of residents in hot spots will be restricted.The restrictions will be imposed in Mumbra as well. “We have already identified three areas as hot spots in Mumbra and have barricaded them. Police and Covid warriors are stationed at these barricades to ensure people do not enter or leave unnecessarily,” said a civic official, who did not wish to be named, from Mumbra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-hot-spots-to-be-locked-down-from-monday/story-clPBVZm25UiQHlzHgNrCFL.html
27-06-2020||City||Gurugram: MCG to plant 80,000 saplings by August 2||Gurugram: At least 80,000 saplings will be planted across the city this monsoon in various drives, a release issued by Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) stated.The corporation started its three-month-long plantation drive on Saturday, where it will be collaborating with Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWAs) to plant saplings on all weekend days falling between June 27 and August 2, of a total of 12 days. Till June 28, around 8,000 saplings will be planted, said officials.The corporation had asked RWAs that wanted to be part of the initiative to send details on the type and quantity of saplings they wanted and that accordingly, the civic body would provide these from their own nurseries free of cost.The MCG has four nurseries in the city, which are located at Biodiversity Park, Kadipur village, Sector 15 Part I, and Sector 46, all of which were made operational last year.For this year’s drive, the civic body has cultivated more than 40,000 saplings of usual and ornamental shrubs, medicinal and native plants and trees at its nurseries. Officials said they will be meeting nearly double the total demand by procuring saplings from the forest department.“We weren’t expecting such a strong response from RWAs, as nearly 95 RWAs have come forward for the initiative so far. We have started making arrangements and will be purchasing around 35,000-40,000 more saplings from the forest department at fixed rates,” said Devender Bhadana, executive engineer, MCG.Officials also said that during the plantation drives, they will be asking RWAs to deposit waste such as metals, tyres, glass, tiles, bottles, crockery, CDs, jute materials, old clothes, plastic and wooden crates in exchange for saplings so that they can recycle them and make cloth face masks, rooftop covers, buntings, tyre pots, bottle decor, wooden plant pots and broken tile floorings, among other such items.MCG officials said that some of the plants and trees they will be distributing during the drives include saplings of fruits native to the region, as well as trees such as gum arabic (babool), sacred fig (peepal), royal Poinciana (gulmohar), and bombax ceiba (seemal).In 2019, the MCG had formed its four nurseries with the aim of distributing at least two lakh saplings, all cultivated in the nurseries, to different parts of the city by 2024.The civic agency is also currently conducting an audit to check the survival rate of saplings planted in previous drives to ascertain which plants and trees require the least amount of care and attention. They said the purpose of the audit is to ensure they cultivate saplings of those plants and trees in the future which have a higher chance of survival and can increase the overall green cover of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-mcg-to-plant-80-000-saplings-by-august-2/story-GCVIwlanQ3FqRJw6trkDHK.html
27-06-2020||Chandigarh||Cong spreading lies on farm ordinances, no plan to end MSP: Tomar||Reiterating that the recent ordinances related to agriculture reforms brought by the Union government were aimed at doubling the farmers’ income, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Saturday said the system of procuring farm produce at minimum support price (MSP) will continue and there is no plan in future to end this system.Addressing Punjab BJP’s virtual rally through videoconferencing from New Delhi, Tomar said the Congress in Punjab was misguiding the people by creating a false fear that the new reforms meant the end of the MSP system.“This is a bundle of lies. No such move has been taken. MSP thi, hai aur rahegi,” said Tomar.The Centre had recently promulgated three ordinances -- the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance.Claiming that new ordinances will prove to be a gamechanger, the Union minister said the reforms will provide a level-playing field for farmers.“These reforms allow farmers to sell their produce wherever they want. Earlier, farmers were compelled to sell their crop at state government facilities to licence-holding players. Under this process, farmers were being duped as they were not getting a fair price for their produce. If the manufacturer of a pen is allowed to sell his product wherever he or she wants, why should farmers not be allowed to sell their produce wherever they choose?” asked Tomar.The Union minister categorically said that grain markets would work as usual and the government is committed to procuring every grain of the farmers from the markets as per system already in place. Now, a farmer from Bathinda can sell his produce in Kolkata as farmers can move inter-state without paying tax, Tomar said.The Union minister said farmers will always have the option to sell their produce at the state government’s markets. “But outside these mandis, farmers will not be taxed,” he added. The reforms have been brought to increase private investment in the agriculture sector so as to make farming a more lucrative business, he said.Tomar also hit out at the Captain Amarinder Singh government alleging that Punjab is on the verge of getting bankrupt due to fiscal mismanagement of the state government. Claiming that Centre was extending all sort of financial help to the state, the Union minister said under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, Rs 2,000 has already been transferred to farmers of Punjab and under Gramin Sadak Yojana Phase-3 , road projects worth Rs 2,185 crore have been sanctioned for Punjab, adding that Rs 292 crore has already been given to the state under MNREGA.State BJP chief Ashwani Sharma said that this virtual rally was broadcasted on 3,000 locations through smart TVs. He said that more than 25 lakh people participated in this virtual rally by using various social digital mediums. Targeting the Punjab government, he said that it has completely failed to control Covid-19 pandemic and involved in corruption. He alleged that Capt government took Covid-19 pandemic as an opportunity and its ministers, MLAs and officers indulged in seed scam, mining scam and PPE kits scam. He further said that illicit liquor mafia has flourished in Punjab during current government’s regime and exhorted the BJP workers to leave no stone unturned to ensure people throw this government out in 2022 assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cong-spreading-lies-on-farm-ordinances-no-plan-to-end-msp-tomar/story-ocgia1Osc7bPAmxSqW3zdJ.html

The probe was ordered by the district administration.The dead man was identified by a single name, Robin, a native of Badhpura village in Dadri. In the report, the SDM did not confirm a case of medical negligence. It read that Robin had consumed a lot of alcohol on June 18, after which his health deteriorated on June 21. “He was admitted at Mangalam Hospital in Dadri with acute headache, vomiting, pain in abdomen and a history of chronic alcoholism after which tests had also been ordered for him. He was discharged on June 24,” said the SDM in the report. A Dadri community health centre (CHC) medical officer jointly probed the incident.On Friday morning, Robin’s heath took a turn for worse and he was taken back to the private hospital but was referred to a government hospital.“His family took him to CHC Dadri around 8.20 am where looking at his condition, the doctors referred him to the district hospital. The medicines that he was recommended were already with him. He was admitted at the district hospital at 9.30 pm where he passed way during treatment,” said the SDM, Rajeev Rai.Officials said Robin was not a Covid-19 patient.“The patient had come with acute headache and vomiting and pain in abdomen. Several tests were ordered fro him and he stayed in the hospital for three days before being discharged,” said a spokesperson for Mangalam hospital.On June 17 too, an inquiry was ordered after users on social media alleged that a three-year-old child, who had fallen from the second floor of a building, was denied treatment in three Noida hospitals.Administration officials said that family did not find fault in the treatment given to the child.Earlier, an eight-month pregnant woman died in Noida after she was allegedly denied treatment at eight private and government hospitals in Noida and Ghaziabad on June 5. An inquiry into this incident resulted in notices being issued to four private hospitals and action against officials of three government hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sdm-inquires-into-death-of-21-year-old-after-social-media-claims-of-medical-negligence/story-2wEIjrkzTSoo8uq0AtgfeP.html

They will look for senior citizens, persons with comorbidities and also those with symptoms of Covid-19. The program will then be initiated from July 5 in entire state,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health).According to officials, there were 607 cases in UP on Friday and 284 of these were from Meerut division.Overall till June 26, the six districts of western UP had 186 out of 649 deaths in UP besides they also accounted for 5764 out of 21549 cases.In Ghaziabad, the officials have already started working on door to door surveys in containment and non-containment zones. According to officials, 470 teams have been deployed for door to door survey in containment zones for past three days.“The teams have covered 37,374 families with a population of about 181,885 persons.

27-06-2020||City||Winds and timing save the day for Noida from invasion of locusts||Noida: The favourable wind directions and timing saved the day for Gautam Budh Nagar, its green belts and about 55,000 hectares of farmlands from the invasion of a swarm of locusts on Saturday.The swarm of locusts that had entered GB Nagar during afternoon hours from Faridabad, flew over some of the district’s villages of agriculture importance and entered the Bulandshahr district where it’s expected to rest and feed after the sunset before regaining momentum with the sunrise, officials and experts said. According to the experts, the swarm entered the district along with strong winds of about 30-40 km per hour of favourable westerly and south-westerly directions that gave it a trajectory to move forward and out of the city limits.“The locust swarm has passed the Noida area and entered the Bulandshahr, moving towards Agra. It rests during the night time and feeds. So, the time it entered Noida there were good winds which were driving them forward. Also, it was afternoon, so the swarm did not settle here. It was a close shave for this city,” said KL Gurjar, deputy director, Locust Warning Organisation (LWO). He said that the locusts fly in the form of a huge swarm in search of food — crops and other vegetation. “These insects can incur huge loss to crops and trees, but they are not dangerous for urban settlements,” Gurjar said.On Saturday morning, the district administration had raised alarm asking the district level locust control team -- constituted in May as a precautionary measure following the locust attack in Rajasthan – to prepare for taking adequate measures, including spray of insecticides like malathion and chlorpyrifos.“It was a large swarm that was travelling in groups. One such group settled briefly at Muhammadpur Jadaun village, but farmers and a district team were already on alert, and they were successful in shooing them away. However, it was the favourable timing and wind speed that saved the day. Otherwise, it could have been heavy losses to the crops due to the large swarm size,” said AN Mishra, deputy director of agriculture, GB Nagar. Mishra further said that the swarm came through Faridabad, and flew over some of the major villages of agricultural importance, including Usmanpur, Bhatta, Muhammadpur Jadaun, among others, and then flew towards Khurja in neighbouring Bulandshahr.“A large area where it made a pit stop had crops including corn, animal pastures and moong dal, while other areas had rice. Had the timing been a little late and they stopped here, about 33,000 hectares of rice plantations would have affected. Rice is one of the major crops of the city, and we export high-quality Basmati rice grown here,” said Mishra.The swarm is currently being intercepted by the seven vehicle-mounted pesticide spray machines and a few drones of the Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), which aims to terminate it wherever its night resting area is.“We are intercepting the swarm, and have also informed the respective district administrations to stay alert. We will tackle them as and when they settle. They can be shooed away using loud sounds such as drum beats and siren. They could be contained by spraying malathion 96, an organophosphate insecticide. Another insecticide, chlorpyrifos, is also sprayed through drones and fire brigade machines on trees where locusts settle during the night when they are sluggish,” said Gurjar. He added that such locust invasions are common in Indo-Pak border districts of Rajasthan and Gujarat. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), a swarm of locusts spread over just one square kilometre of area can eat as much food as 35,000 people would consume in a single day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/winds-and-timing-save-the-day-for-noida-from-invasion-of-locusts/story-2rwSJwWqB7DzJOxqXBgOPM.html

However, 24 of them have already been discharged while others are asymptomatic, the officials said. Police personnel are among the front line workers who are randomly tested for the infection to ensure that there is no transmission of the virus in the department.“The personnel working at the city borders, in containment zones or posted at hospitals or isolation centres and shelter homes are tested regularly,” said the senior police officer quoted above.Though those posted at police stations are not tested regularly, sanitization is often carried out along with other measures such as social distancing and use of mask, the police said.In May, the traffic police office located in Sector 14A had shut down the public challan window temporarily when a cop there had tested positive.“But we resumed operations last week and no positive cases are there anymore.

27-06-2020||City||Cases doubling fast in Ghaziabad, health department to focus on reducing death rate||Ghaziabad on Saturday stood second in Uttar Pradesh in number of active Covid-19 cases and third in most deaths due to the disease.In the absence of total number of tests in the daily state health bulletins, however, these numbers are not indicative of the prevalence of the disease in the state or even the district. The sharp rise in number of cases in June, however, is due to better testing and surveillance, according to the district’s chief medical officer (CMO) Dr. N K Gupta.During the first two weeks of June, there were 22 positive cases per day. The third saw this number jump to 42 and in the ongoing last week, the average is about 78 per day, according to officials. “During the past five days, we have had ranging between 70-80 per day and in one instance they also went over 100. The cases have shown increasing trend in June and will continue in July as well,” said Gupta.With the surge in cases, the district administration is now working on getting one more L-1 category hospital (for mild cases), either at SRM University, Modinagar or IMS College, Dasna. The recently acquired privately-run 250-bedded Divyajyoti Hospital at Niwari is almost on fully occupied.“We will have about 180 patients at Divyajyoti Hospital by Saturday night and need to open one more hospital soon. We are expecting that discharges of more patients will start taking shape, as per new discharge guidelines, from next week. Till then, one more facility is needed for L-1 patients who are generally symptomatic,” CMO added.According to the state control room figures till June 26, Ghaziabad had a total of 1333 cases (69 fresh), which included 50 deaths and 680 active cases. Till May 31, there were four deaths.According to the CMO, the district tested 18,000 samples so far and pegged the positivity rate (which is the number of samples testing positive per test) at 7.4%. The recovery rate is 45%.“The more of positive cases have resulted as we have now started with sampling of high risk groups and cases of influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory illness.This sampling towards the fixed groups is intended to reach out to the potential cases at the earliest and prevent them from getting into critical state and deaths due to Covid-19. Our prime focus is to reduce deaths. Since we have also started with antigen testing directed at the specific groups, the positive cases will rise further,” CMO added.“The sampling figures will provide correct picture about density of cases and will further help in policy decisions. It could be an internal decision not to reveal sampling figures which they were providing earlier. But it is ideal that sampling should be enhanced to wide range of groups to know the exact incidence of Covid-19,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association, Ghaziabad.The state of Uttar Pradesh, unlike Delhi, has no provision for home isolation of Covid-19 positive cases. As per the new discharge guidelines issued on June 19, asymptomatic patients in hospitals can be discharged on the 10th day if they still showed no symptoms without undergoing any test. But, such patients will have to remain in home quarantine for seven days after discharge.As per the earlier guidelines, a positive patient needed to have two successive negative reports in order to get discharged.“We have initiated the antigen testing in 10 districts of the state including six districts of western Uttar Pradesh. We conducted about 826 antigen tests on Friday and 26 persons were found positive for Covid-19 infection,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health).The western UP districts of the state which also includes Meerut are worst affected in terms of rising number of cases as well as number of deaths which have taken place so far.The six districts Meerut, Baghpat, Bulandshahr, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar and Hapur account for 26.74% of total cases and 28.65% deaths in UP till June 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cases-doubling-fast-in-ghaziabad-health-department-to-focus-on-reducing-death-rate/story-SLXj4f3HPr4sZXQVZoM01H.html
27-06-2020||Mumbai||Court denies bail to man who sexually abused grandchild||The special court under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act refused to grant interim bail to a 64-year-old painter from central Mumbai who has been booked for sexually abusing his 10-year-old granddaughter, observing that the minor and her mother are not traceable.The accused had approached the special court for interim bail, claiming that he is in prison since July 2017 and is also suffering from fever. The accused claimed that he is falsely implicated by his daughter over a property dispute. The daughter, a complainant in the case, alleged that on May 11, 2017, the accused raped her and threatened her that he would kill her children.Later, on June 27, 2017, the 10-year-old daughter of the complainant told her that the accused attempted to sexually abuse her. Further, the complainant alleged that on July 1, 2017, when she visited her mother, her father had raped her again.The prosecution claimed that the complainant and her daughter are not traceable. While objecting to the accused’s plea, the court maintained that the accused cannot take benefit of the Covid situation. The special court, while rejecting the bail application, observed that the police have not yet succeeded in securing the presence of the minor and his mother, but the trial is going on. The court held that since the accused is a close relative of the survivor and is the father of the informant, there is every possibility that the accused might try to influence the minor and her mother, after being released on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/court-denies-bail-to-man-who-sexually-abused-grandchild/story-y7LVAhGtWIUM3gJ9osLCEO.html

This lockdown will be followed by residents of Kolshet, Dokali and Balkum areas. The lockdown will be imposed from Monday with only medical stores, milk dairies and hospitals remaining operational. This is the first instance of residents deciding to impose a lockdown in Thane. This comes after Majiwada Manpada ward reported the highest number of 64 cases on Friday. A meeting was held on Friday evening with the representatives of housing societies and residents wherein the decision to impose lockdown was taken. Residents have used social media to spread awareness regarding the lockdown.Omprakash Patil, a resident of Balkum, said, “After mission unlock, the number of cases in this ward, which till date had few cases, increased rapidly. We had expected that the corporation will impose a lockdown. However with no such decision from them, we ourselves have decided to go for one week lockdown from Monday.”Milk delivery will be allowed from 5am to 8am while only medical and hospitals will be allowed to function. No other shops including vegetables, groceries or meat will be allowed to remain open in the coming week.Sanjay Bhoir, Shiv Sena Corporator from the area, said, “There are over 250 residential complexes while 50% of the area is covered with slums. After the lockdown norms were eased, social distancing was violated which led to increase in number of cases. The residents also requested to impose a strict lockdown to flatten the curve in this area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-declare-their-own-lockdown-to-flatten-curve/story-baO2f0iIS8hsxs9IfPRXaN.html

They have strongly opposed the move of the civic body to take over two 24-storey buildings for setting up quarantine facility for high-risk Covid-19 contacts.The bench ordered the senior court official to visit the site and submit a report, as the petitioners maintained that some of the flats in the buildings were occupied, whereas the civic body asserted that the buildings were not yet occupied.Senior advocate Ram Apte, who represented TMC, claimed that the occupation certification for the buildings was granted on March 9, a fortnight before imposition of the nationwide lockdown, therefore the towers could not have been occupied.The court has posted the petition for further hearing on July 7, and directed TMC to maintain status quo till then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-orders-inspection-of-residential-towers-taken-over-by-tmc-for-quarantine-facility/story-KfJK6TfROmyyxGpm3WxXOI.html

The delegation also demanded that PSPCL should upgrade its infrastructure in the city and state government should provide electricity at Rs 5 per unit as promised. Kular said, “In contradiction to the claims of state government, the industry is being charged Rs 10-15 per unit. Also, the infrastructure is not being improved as 50 applications for industrial connections are pending as the grids are working at full capacity.”The government should provide a 50% rebate on night tariff in the state and the fixed charges should also be waived off at least till March 31, 2021, to provide relief to the industry at this hour of crises, said Kular.Jain said that the PSPCL is also demanding advance consumption deposit from the industry even when security is already with the PSPCL. The department should not demand a deposit for the next two years as the industry is already going through a tough phase post lockdown, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/industrialists-body-demands-50-rebate-on-night-tariff-waiver-of-fixed-power-charges-in-punjab/story-51oWuCbtL1zE8E8mooSRDI.html

27-06-2020||City||Delhi University postpones online open-book exams to July 10||New Delhi: Delhi University on Saturday postponed to July 10 the online open-book examinations (OBE) for final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students that were to begin on July 1, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a varsity statement.In the statement signed by DU’s dean of examinations Vinay Gupta, the varsity said all stakeholders, “especially students may find it difficult to attend their scheduled activities of examinations.” The city added 2,948 cases of the infectious disease on Saturday, taking the city’s total to 80,188, of whom 2,558 have died.Dean (exams) Vinay Gupta said the new date sheets will be announced by July 3 and students can appear for mock tests, designed to facilitate open book exams, from July 4.“All other activities/facilities notified by examination branch related with OBE mode of examinations adopted as one-time measure for academic session 2019-20 through various notices/notifications shall remain unchanged and no further notification shall be issued either as corrigendum or amendment,” Gupta added.The development comes after the Union minister for human resources development, Ramesh Pokhriyal, on Wednesday advised the University Grants Commission to “revisit the guidelines issued earlier for intermediate and terminal semester examinations and academic calendar.” The minister had said the revisited guidelines would have the “health and safety of students, teachers, and staff” as its foundation.Some DU officials, however, said they are not pleased with the move. Rajesh Jha, a member of the varsity’s executive council, said, “Instead of postponement, there must be cancellation of OBE exams. Arbitrary decisions like these will leave psychological scars on final-year students.” Former DU academic council member Pankaj Garg said, “The University is making a mockery of examinations for final year students. The Covid-19 situation is not going to improve in the next 10 days. This decision will further create an atmosphere of confusion, and add to stress on teachers and students of DU.”The dean of examinations, however, said the decision was taken keeping in mind the demands of students also. “We postponed the exams because students wanted more time to appear for the mock tests, since this is the first time online OBEs are being conducted. We had earlier planned to conduct a mock test on two days but will now give students four-five days to appear for the mock papers,” Gupta said.DU academic council member Saikat Ghosh said the postponement was a direct result of the administration’s failure to conduct mock tests. “DU’s OBE system is clearly faulty and not able to cater to the needs of students. The administration wants to buy time to try and rectify technical shortcomings. Hence, the postponement has no relation to students’ welfare,” he said.Maidnee Goja, a final-year student of microbiology, said, “I don’t understand the idea of postponing semester exams for 10 days. We have been asking them to promote us on the basis of previous semesters. This is not like board exams where the score of one paper is being considered for promotion and we have grades for the past five semesters. Yet, everyday there is a new notification on the exams which is causing students more stress.”DU Students’ Union (DUSU) also opposed the development. “We demand the DU administration comes out clear on issues and lets us know if exams are going to take place or not. If yes, we need to know the arrangements,” said Shivangi Kharwal, DUSU joint secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-university-postpones-online-open-book-exams-to-july-10/story-g0GyMHZDJVA5aoj5vVkdtO.html

The drug was originally used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said the orders will not be applicable for patients who cannot afford it.A senior official said treatment of Covid-19 patients is free at the institute, but, as this drug is costly, it will not be viable for them to support every patient who needs it. It costs around ₹35,000 in the market. Dr GD Puri, dean academics and head, department of anesthesia and intensive care, in his blog stated that patients belonging to well-to-do families who have more than enough resources are reluctant to come forward to replenish stock of the drug for economically backward patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/well-to-do-patients-should-replenish-stock-of-costly-covid-drug-pgimer/story-JflmtbYR4HenLhbPCemSLM.html
27-06-2020||City||Ludhiana residents concerned over waste along Buddha Nullah||The lackadaisical approach adopted by the municipal corporation (MC) in cleaning the Buddha Nullah is likely to take a toll on the residents during the coming monsoon season as silt has again accumulated at different points including, New Kundanpuri and main Haibowal Puli.The residents have also been raising concern over the dumping of silt, which is removed from the nullah, along its banks. They rued that it would again flow into the nullah during rainfall and the MC should regularly shift the silt from the site.Ratan Singh, a resident of the New Kundanpuri area, said, “Every time the residents have to bear the brunt for the MC’s failure in getting the nullah cleaned. This year also, the MC had commenced the desilting work with a delay of around two months. The work was being carried out rigorously during the initial days. Now again, filth has accumulated in the nullah which reduces its capacity and leads to overflowing of the nullah during the rainy season.”Former BJP councillor Narinder Malhi said, “The desilting process is not being taken up properly and silt is not being removed from the centre. The silt which is being removed is being dumped along the banks, which will again flow into the nullah during rainfall.” MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “Poclain machines have been deployed and the nullah is being cleaned regularly. Machinery has also been deployed to shift the silt which is lifted out. Residents are also at fault as they dump waste into the nullah. The officials of operations and maintenance cells have been told to keep the nullah and internal drain lines clean so that residents don’t face trouble due to water accumulation or overflowing of nullah during monsoon.”The nullah overflows almost every year near the New Kundanpuri area, Upkar Nagar and surrounding areas, leaving the residents in a fix as the rainwater mixed with sewer enters their houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-residents-concerned-over-waste-along-buddha-nullah/story-nqf4B8l2ArvHbFLhTVjyzN.html
27-06-2020||Chandigarh||Reader’s take: Is Chandigarh ready for monsoon?||The heavens opened up on June 19, giving Chandigarh residents a breather from the stifling 40 degrees Celsius heat. But there was a problem, as 23.7mm rain over 50 minutes left roads waterlogged, an indication of how ill-prepared the city is for the monsoon.From Sector 39 B to the northern sectors, resident welfare association heads complained about road gullies being in bad shape, covered with leaves and debris. The inner sector road in Sector 19 was also flooded with roots from old trees choking the drains.Manimajra fared badly as a railway under bridge (RUB) was flooded.Municipal corporation (MC) chief engineer Shailender Singh, when questioned about the matter, said that around 50% of the 30,000 road gullies have been cleaned and the rest will be done soon.However, despite his optimism, how the MC handles the situation is the big question as it’s already struggling with a financial crunch after the Covid-19 lockdown failed to yield adequate revenues.The civic body is expecting to earn around ₹81 crore less than the budget estimates. A major shortfall of around ₹50 crore is expected in water collection. Revenue from community centre bookings is also expected to come down by ₹4 crore. Will it be able to rustle up the funds to immediately clean the drainage system? Checking of power lines too will be required to prevent outages and damaged roads repaired quickly to ensure no potholes appear, raising risks of accidents and fatalities.Also, with the world in the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic, planning needs to be done on a war footing to prevent outbreaks of waterborne diseases.Too much needs to be done in very little time? Are the city authorities ready for it?RAIN PAINIs Chandigarh ready for monsoon?Is Chandigarh ready for the monsoon?

27-06-2020||City||As Kashmir’s first multiplex nears completion, films may hit screen from next year||If all goes well, Kashmir will be getting its first multiplex next year.Ever since militancy broke out in Kashmir in the early 1990s, people lost all chances of experiencing outdoor cinema as movie theatres in the valley were forced to shut down.Decades later, a Kashmiri Pandit business family from Srinagar has almost completed the construction of a multiplex at Shivpora near Badami Bagh Cantt.“The building is complete. We had got permission from the cantonment board to establish a commercial complex. The then governor, Satya Pal Malik, wanted it to be a cinema and we said alright. The cinema will be one of the components besides commercial places and food court. It will take time till March-April next year,” said Vijay Dhar, who is also the owner of Delhi Public School, Srinagar.His two sons Vikas and Vishal had applied for the permission for Kashmir’s first multiplex.“We know it’s not easy to setup the multiplex and hope the government will remove all the impediments which are required for this project. We are almost done with the multiplex, it needs finishing touches and people can come and the watch films once it opens next year,” Vikas said adding that he came to know that some people in the Badami Bagh Cantt board had raised some objections. “I hope everything will be sorted out by the time it gets ready,” said Vikas, who currently shuttles between Delhi, Jammu and Srinagar. “Once complete, I will be permanently stationed here and the latest movies will be released and we would love to see families coming to watch them.” Vijay said since the pandemic is ongoing, we are waiting for the new rules on social distancing and seating arrangements. “My purpose for this complex is to provide the youth with the same recreational facilities as they get in the rest of the country. Besides, this initiative will also generate employment. Will people come or not, I will not go into that? If they don’t want to come we can’t force them.”Officials said the Srinagar municipal Corporation has also granted permission to the owner of the single-screen theatre, Naaz Cinema, to renovate the building into a multiplex. Many former theatres and cinemas have been converted into shopping complexes, nursing homes and some have been occupied by the paramilitary forces.Srinagar deputy commissioner Shahid Iqbal Choudhary said once the building and project is complete, licences will be issued to other people who wish to open cinemas or multiplexes.“As of now, building permissions have been given for repairs of old cinema complexes. M/S Taksal Hospitality Pvt Ltd, owned by Dhars, has applied for permission for the multiplex and we have told them once the building is complete the licence will be granted to them after checking safety, security and other measures,” he said.After the closure of movie theatres in the militancy-ridden valley, the first attempt to open cinema halls was made in 1999, when movie theatres – Neelam, Regal and Broadway – opened in Srinagar. However, after militants lobbed a grenade on Regal Cinema, which also led to the death of one person, it closed down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-kashmir-s-first-multiplex-nears-completion-films-may-hit-screen-from-next-year/story-SLhkAUjtIVgBzQ8m0z4bgJ.html
27-06-2020||City||Capt allows buses to run at full seating capacity, masks mandatory||Chandigarh Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Saturday announced to allow all buses to ferry passengers to their seating capacity with the condition that everybody should wear masks.The CM made the announcement during his Facebook Live interaction programme #AskCaptain while replying to a question by a Patiala resident regarding problems being faced by them due to non-availability of buses.The state government had earlier allowed plying of buses with 50% capacity.The CM said he had learnt that buses were still off the road as restricted passenger load leads to financial losses. He also announced extension in the deadline for applying for mini bus permits from June 30 to July 15.Applications have been invited by the state government for permits covering more than 1,400 rural routes. The Punjab & Haryana high court had on Tuesday rejected a plea of the existing private mini bus operators for a stay on the government move.‘Extending lockdown depends on future’Amarinder said the decision on extension of the lockdown in the state beyond June 30 will depend on the situation, adding he was prepared to take whatever steps needed to control the Covid spread. “It is in your hands. If we are able to control the pandemic then there will be no need for the lockdown but if it goes out of control, then we have no choice. Lockdowns were imposed for the safety of Punjab’s people,” he said.Underlining the need to wear masks in public places, he pointed out that on Friday alone, 4,024 people were challaned for not wearing masks and 45 for spitting in public in Punjab. Pointing out that experts had projected Punjab’s peak yet to come, Amarinder said the state could not afford to be lax in any way.To a question on overcharging by private hospitals, the CM said the state government was in the process of fixing rates. On cancellation of examinations in universities and colleges as had already been announced by some states, the CM said the vice-chancellors will be meeting education department official and take a decision in consultation with the University Grants Commission.Follow heart to protect farmers’ interests, Capt tells AkalisAmarinder also urged the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders to keep their political compulsions aside and follow heart in the interest of the state and its farmers on the issue of ordinances of the central government.Stressing that there should be no politics when it came to issues of Punjab’s interests, Amarinder recalled that during his first tenure as the chief minister, he had abrogated the water agreements with neighbouring states to save Punjab’s water for its people. “Not only did I go against my own party on the issue, but also put my career at stake with this move. Punjab’s interests are paramount for me, they should be so for the Akalis too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/capt-allows-buses-to-run-at-full-seating-capacity-masks-mandatory/story-IYI5jIMzrnl3ChedsNEPxL.html
27-06-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Home they brought the flowers for the dead||Fathers of our Kargil War heroes have made pilgrimages to the high battlefields where their sons laid down their lives. Some walked up, took a pony ride, others took a vehicle to those sites where the Indian Army fought an exemplar of high-altitude warfare in the summer of 1999. They brought back memories from those pilgrimage points, where their sons had died.On June 29, 1999, Capt Vijayant Thapar ‘Robin’, Vir Chakra, of the 2 Rajputana Rifles was shot through the head by a Pakistani sniper at Knoll in the Drass sector. A few days later, in the Batalik sector on July 1, 1999, Capt. Keishing Clifford Nongrum, Maha Vir Chakra, of the 12 JAK Light Infantry died fighting during the assault on Point 4812. Their fathers, Col VN Thapar (retd), and Keishing Peter, erected petite memorials at those heights. A Vijayant Memorial Mandir stands at Knoll while a Memory Cross was installed at Point 4812 for Capt Nongrum by their loving parents. Col Thapar brought back wildflowers of the high mountains that had magically flourished around the temple and bloomed in the dried blood that had merged into the alpine soil. He pasted them in Vijayant’s Baby Book and wrote the poignant words: “These were flowers which were growing at Robin’s temple up at Knoll. Brought when I went there in September ’03. It was a bit of a miracle because at that place not a blade of grass grows. Also, in that place were a family of four chicks of Ram Chakore. Life grows around Robin.” Born in Naya Nangal, Punjab, Robin had studied at Chandigarh’s DAV College while staying with his maternal grandmother in Sector 21. Col Thapar and Neha Dwivedi have recently authored a book on Robin, Vijayant at Kargil: The Biography of a War Hero.Keishing, who is based in Shillong, Meghalaya, made the journey to Point 4812 after the War and he set up that Memory Cross with a bouquet of flowers and candles. “On that lonely hill, the eternal flame in honour of our son shall ever flicker, his memories bloom in our hearts forever like those flowers at the Memory Cross,” Keishing told this writer.  Baya weaver nests have gripped our imagination and spurred a popular interest in bird life. But the Baya is only one of the four weaver bird species found in India. Of the other three, the Finn’s weaver may be headed for extinction. According to the Bombay Natural History Society, there may be less than 500 adult birds of this species left in India. The Finn’s weaver is a bird of grasslands, especially of the Terai region, and the conquest of these habitats by the “Development JCB” has left these birds without homes to bring up their little ones in lamp post-like nests. Associated with this threat was the menace of illegally trapping the Finn’s weaver for the grey market to serve as a cage bird.The nest of the Finn’s weaver is different from that of the other three weaver species. The rarity of this bird is underscored by the fact that expeditions were launched since 1934 to trace this bird. It was first brought to light as a species by the celebrated ornithologist AO Hume in 1866, who, struck by the bird’s huge bill, named it Ploceus megarhynchus. That stands till today as the zoological nomenclature for the Finn’s weaver.In contemporary times, ornithologists and researchers were trying very hard to trace a breeding colony of this bird to set up a captive breeding project on the lines of those initiated for vultures and the Great Indian Bustard. Efforts did not make much headway till last week when renowned birder and photographer, Rajesh Panwar, discovered a breeding colony of the Finn’s weaver at the Haripora-Baur reservoir near Kaladhungi in Uttarakhand. The discovery has thrilled researchers and conservationists. The nesting colony was on the water reeds of the Ipomoea plant, a substantive find. For Panwar, it marked the culmination of a six-year search for a breeding colony of the Finn’s weaver. He has also other feathers in his cap. Panwar is credited with the first photographic record from India of the migratory Red-breasted goose and a contested first Indian record of the “Japanese Paradise flycatcher”.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-home-they-brought-the-flowers-for-the-dead/story-eDSuHw1Rmznp1SyEKhLJeO.html
27-06-2020||Chandigarh||Welcome to the age of social media and herd mentality||It was the birthday of a dear friend of mine a few days ago. Sadly, she had lost her battle with cancer three years ago. However, on that particular day, Facebook popped up a reminder.As thoughts flew to her and her cheerful smile, I browsed Facebook and saw that 303 people had posted on her timeline. When I clicked on the newsfeed and started reading the messages I found that barring two or three that said: ‘Missing you dear on your birthday’ or ‘May God grant you a better life,’ in remembrance, the others had simply sent birthday wishes.The hollowness and the falsity of it all hit me like a brick. I realised that 99% of her ‘Facebook friends’ did not even know that she was no longer in this world. What made this even more surprising was that my friend’s husband had replaced her earlier profile picture with a copy of her obituary. And most people had not noticed!This made me think that our friends on social media are perhaps just in name. True friends are those that care and share our joys and sorrows.Another incident got me thinking. Yesterday morning, one of my WhatsApp groups showed 49 messages. On opening it I saw that most of them were birthday wishes for a friend.On a hunch, I checked the participant list of the group and my sixth sense proved right. The birthday girl of the day was not a member of the group. I posed an innocuous query, saying: “Is she even a member of this group?” After a pregnant pause, the group admin posted a sheepish emoji saying, “No, she is not! Sorry!”I really wonder why we just do what everyone is doing without applying our minds to it, just because a notification or a message prompts us to do so. Would it not be prudent to pause and think before you act?This reminds me of a little anecdote of a man seeing a young boy gazing at the sky. So he also stood near him and did the same thing. Another and yet another followed suit. Eventually, there were about 20-odd people looking up. When the young boy looked around him and saw the group, he asked the first man, “What are you looking at?” The reply was, “Oh nothing! You were looking up, so I thought it would be something interesting and did the same.” The second man and the third and so on... All lowered their heads and fumbled and mumbled as they were humbled by their own foolishness. The little boy said, “Oh! I wasn’t looking at anything. I had a stiff neck. Was just trying to ease it!”priyatandon65@gmail.com(The writer is a Chandigarh-based freelance contributor)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/welcome-to-the-age-of-social-media-and-herd-mentality/story-gUA3o5ZKqudtmv4JD4tvtL.html
27-06-2020||Chandigarh||Dilemma over staying safe during the Covid-19 pandemic||What does it take to make the human mind understand the stark truths of life? We are collectively hard nuts to crack when it comes to following a discipline.We need a pandemic to keep our environment clean. Nature can blossom only when man’s ravaging instincts are controlled.We need a lockdown to put us in our place, but do you think we have learnt a lesson from it?That’s hard to say, if we go by the restlessness that we are exhibiting in the unlocking phase. The tough part is that we need to prevent the spread of the dreaded disease, but doing so is totally dependent on our understanding of how precautions are to be taken.But there we are, unabashedly compounding the task, by an obnoxious display of our reluctance to stay indoors.They say ‘ fools march in where angels fear to tread’. Sadly, many people have started going out and about just because lockdown hours have been relaxed.This foolhardiness is not just confined to India , but has a universal overtone. People have decided to get out of their homes as a matter of right. That they are bored at home is reason enough for them to embrace the chance of getting infected.The other day, a few families in my neighbourhood went for a picnic. I was the odd one out and was scoffed at for what they said was my cowardly behaviour. To their erudite minds, they were playing safe, because all of them knew each other and were not infected. Well, I wonder if they had enlightened the virus about the rules of the game.As the pandemic rages, we face a dilemma: At one moment it feels right to face the challenge and resume normal life with a brave heart, and on the other it seems wise to stay confined indoors.Society has been divided in two factions. One section has started its normal routine and is gleefully posting its deeds of bravado on social media. By refusing to wear a mask in public Donald Trump is trying to project a macho image. The others are still terrified of contracting the disease and hiding indoors. These topsy-turvy times have brought us all to sixes and sevens. The temptation to go out is too strong while the option of staying put sounds mundane. No one knows how safe we are or for how long will we remain safe. Each person is interpreting safety measures in his or her own way. We were ecstatic at the news of tennis star Novak Djokovic holding a tournament, but, later, happiness turned to horror when we heard about him getting infected with his wife Jelena, three other players, three coaches and one player’s pregnant wife.As we oscillate from one extreme to another , I hope we are able to sort out the right way of living through this dark phase. Let better sense prevail where we do not give in to our whims and fancies at the drop of a hat. This drudgery of life is reiterating the point, that till the dust of the unseen enemy settles down, it is better to play safe, than to be sorry. I wonder how many have heard it, and how many are still waiting for tougher times, till reality sinks in. Life is not to be taken chances with, because you only live once.alkagaurkashyap@gmail.comThe writer is a Chandigarh-based lawyer||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dilemma-over-staying-safe-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/story-aXRsNEcc4hPhptGot0u01K.html
27-06-2020||City||SGPC admits 267 ‘saroops’ missing, denies they perished in 2016 fire||COUNTERCHARGE Gurdwara body officials say allegations of ex-employee through a rights body is a ploy to save his own skin as he is an accused in the caseAMRITSAR A day after Punjab Human Rights Organisation (PHRO) accused Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) of keeping under wraps the matter of damage to Guru Granth Sahib’s ‘saroops’ in fire at its publishing house, the management body on Saturday refuted the charges, but admitted that 267 ‘saroops’ are missing and a probe is already underway.Before presenting their side on the matter, SGPC senior vice-president Rajinder Singh Mehta, chief secretary Roop Singh, secretary Manjit Singh, additional secretary Sukhdev Singh Bhoora held a meeting at Teja Singh Samundari Hall here.Terming the accusations as “misleading” and “condemnable”, the SGPC functionaries said the rights body has maliciously attempted to create a new controversy within the community. “Actually, Kanwaljit Singh, former employee of the SGPC’s publication department, who is an accused in the missing ‘saroops’ case, is making this matter complex to get off the hook,” said Mehta.“On his superannuation day on May 31 this year, Kanwaljit while handing over the charge confessed that the publishing house is short of 267 ‘saroops’, and the SGPC is probing it. He accepted in writing to pay the fine for the same. Now, he is tarnishing the image of the gurdwara body to save his skin by linking it with the 2016 fire incident and giving it a political colour.”On the PHRO, Mehta said, “It should have come to the gurdwara body before levelling these allegations publicly. This is not the jurisdiction of this organisation.”He said only five ‘saroops’ were destroyed in the 2016 fire after a short circuit and nine ‘saroops’ got damaged due to water in the fire-control operation. “The incident was also reported by the media then. Now, it is being given the colour that the SGPC deliberately hid this incident. This is a deep-rooted conspiracy. The allegations are politically motivated and baseless,” he said.“The ‘saroops’ that were damaged were taken to Goindwal Sahib for cremation. Care of rest of the ‘saroops’ is the responsibility of the publication department.”‘SGPC officials forced me to sign affidavit’Ex-employee of the publication department Kanwaljit Singh said the confessional affidavit was forcibly taken from him by senior SGPC officials on the day of his retirement. “On the day of my retirement, senior SGPC officials called me in a room and tortured me. They forced me to sign the document,” he said.Meanwhile, the then chief secretary, Harcharan Singh, who visited the spot after the fire incident as per the version of the SGPC, said, “I had paid a brief visit to the spot. I do not remember the count of ‘saroops’ damaged but one thing I remember is that some ‘saroops’ are repairable. A sub-committee was constituted then to probe the matter.”The sub-committee comprised the then senior vice-president Raghujit Singh Virk, junior vice-president Kewal Singh Badal, general secretary Sukhdev Singh Bhaur, executive member Rajinder Singh Mehta, secretary Roop Singh and additional secretary Balwinder Singh Jaurasingha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sgpc-admits-267-saroops-missing-denies-they-perished-in-2016-fire/story-YYMD4Tjavgs3vW8w28n4cJ.html
27-06-2020||City||Himachal CM directs for making elaborate arrangements for apple season||While presiding over a meeting to review the preparedness regarding the harvesting of the apple crops, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur directed the officials to make elaborate and comprehensive arrangements for transportation of apple produce so that orchardists do not face any inconvenience for taking their produce to the markets amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He said that to facilitate the fruit growers, HPMC has empanelled 26 firms for the supply of packaging material viz. cartons, separators, trays and other material. About 1.20 crore cartons are ready with these firms for supply to the orchardists, he added.Thakur said that the horticulture department has made arrangements for the marketing of the crop at Aazadpur mandi in New Delhi and Gannaur Mandi at Sonipat in Haryana. He said that controlled atmosphere stores have been identified in government and private sectors in Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi having a total capacity of about 1.17 lakh metric tonnes. Besides this cold storage facility of 32,000 MT is available to facilitate the horticulturists, he added.He directed the public works department to ensure proper maintenance of the roads and other linking roads in the apple growing areas to make to ensure smooth movement of vehicular traffic. He said that law and order situation must be ensured during the apple season in the areas for which control room at various locations must be set up to ascertain the smooth movement of trucks, to and fro.The Chief Minister said that the horticulture department must also hold a meeting with the contractors to make arrangements of labour. Thakur said that adequate arrangements must be made to facilitate the labourers. He said that the farmers must be motivated to avoid the use of colour spray so as to slow down to the season. He said that alternative arrangements of labourers must be made. He said that if required the state government could even consider sending buses up to even Dehradun and other places to bring Nepali labourers to the state. He said that matter should also be taken with the district administration of bordering districts of Nepal to bring labourers to the state. Thakur said that the farmers of the state would get a remunerative price of their produce as this year the import of apples from other countries would not be possible this year due to the pandemic. A mechanism must be developed to bring labour from different parts of the state to the apple growing areas. This would not only reduce the over-dependency of growers on Nepali labour but also facilitate the horticulturists, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-cm-directs-for-making-elaborate-arrangements-for-apple-season/story-K3ZCNHFGoP7IJt5ReMwOpM.html

27-06-2020||Bangalore||Bengaluru to get 10,000 bed Covid care facilities by Monday evening: Karnataka Minister||Amid surge in Covid-19 cases, Karnataka Medical Education Minister S Sudhakar on Saturday said arrangements will be made to have 10,000 beds in government and private hospitals by Monday evening and multi-storey residential apartment complexes will also be used to treat infected patients. “By Monday evening, we will have a definite information about the number of beds available in the government and private hospitals. Efforts are afoot to arrange 10,000 beds to treat coronavirus patients by Monday evening,” Sudhakar said in a statement on Saturday after video conferencing with the health department officials. Apart from government and private hospitals, buildings belonging to the Bengaluru Development Authority, housing board, apartments constructed by the private builders, government and private sports facilities, playgrounds, hostels and major commercial buildings will be utilised to treat coronavirus patients, the minister said. “Since covid care centres do not require much facilities, the multi-storey residential apartment complexes built by BDA and housing department will be utilised. BDA has around 1700 flats. BDA commissioner Mahadev will inform the exact number of flats available for use on Monday,” Sudhakar explained. Based on the facilities available, these will be converted to either COVID care centres or hospitals, Sudhakar said. He underlined that for the past one week about 30 to 35 per cent of the infected cases are showing symptoms. It has been instructed to experts to classify the symptomatic cases as mild, moderate and severe and prepare treatment protocols, he said, adding that private hospitals have been instructed to reserve 50 per cent of the beds for COVID treatment. Discussions will be held with managements of private hospitals and they will be provided details of capping of treatment cost. The possibility of utilising almost entire capacity in private medical colleges is being examined, Sudhakar said.

27-06-2020||Mumbai||Politicians scale down festivities they organise||Dahi Handi and Ganeshotsav will be a low-key affair this year, as many politicians, who organise festivities, have decided to scale them down owing to the spread of novel coronavirus.Political analysts point out that the politicians are averse to taking any risk in the current pandemic situation. “There is a fear that if there is a spike in Covid-19 cases in their areas, it will hurt their political image and their credibility will be damaged,” said Surendra Jondhale, a political analyst. BJP legislator Ram Kadam, who organises a grand Dahi Handi at Ghatkopar, has decided to cancel the celebration this year. “Lakhs of people get together every year to celebrate Dahi Handi, hence social distancing is impossible. We have decided to cancel the event this year,” said Kadam. Ganeshotsav, on August 22, too, will be a low-key affair this year as the height of the idols has been restricted. The ruling party Shiv Sena said it will abide by the government’s directive to scale down festivities. Ganeshotsav has played a vital role in the growth of the Shiv Sena, as most of its top leaders have headed Ganesh mandals. Even the secretary of Lalbaugcha Raja, Sudhir Salvi, is a senior Sena office bearer.Sena legislator Ajay Choudhari said the party is coordinating with the mandals. “Most of the office bearers of these mandals are from Sena. They have all decided to scale down the festivities and adhere to the directions given by the state government,” said Choudhari. “Our main priority is the safety of the local population.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/politicos-decide-to-scale-down-festivities-dahi-handi-ganesh-festival-to-be-a-low-key-affair/story-ixEMpNnfEMXTjY04GamEAM.html

The rally, Kisan Bachao, Punjab Bachao Rosh Yatra, was flagged off from Amritsar two days earlier but the police allowed only the Bains brothers to pedal on to Sector 2. The cops had no choice but to drive slow while escorting them to their destination. Some rued the wastage of fuel at a time when oil prices are rising.Need to keep distance at UT SecretariatWhile the UT administration is strictly enforcing social distancing in Chandigarh, a visit to government offices reveals that it needs to put its own house in order, too. “Rooms are small and with most staff now attending office, social distancing goes for a toss. In fact, in some offices, there is no scope for distancing and employees sit shoulder to shoulder,” said an employee of the UT Secretariat in Sector 9.Chandigarh DGP takes to Twitter to salute staffChandigarh director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Baniwal was not only prompt to appreciate the good work done by a woman sub inspector and her husband but also quick to share the appreciation on social media. “Continuing to uphold our motto: We care for you. SI Eram Rizvi and her husband have been taking care of 48 kids at a quarantine centre,” the proud boss tweeted last week.Cop gets dressing down for calling gangster Bhaji!A Chandigarh Police inspector got pulled up the other day for addressing gangster Sampat Nehra as Bhaji (brother). During the investigation into the recent firing incidents in the city, an overenthusiastic cop called up Nehra, who is jailed in Punjab, and addressed him as Bhaji. Little did he realise that he was speaking in front of a superintendent of police rank officer. The SP reported the matter to the Chandigarh DGP, who gave the inspector a piece of his mind.Queries pour in for the weather man as rains arriveThe monsoon arrived on Wednesday, six days before scheduled. Excited residents kept calling the local office of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) with mundane questions. A resident called up to say that he was constructing his house and wanted to know how much it would rain so that he could cut cost on watering the foundation that was to be laid that day. Another resident wanted to know if it would rain daily so he could give his gardener a few days off! Wonder what the weather man told them.UT health department gets digital upgrade thanks to CovidFor the first time, the UT health department conducted review meetings with its frontline health workers via video-conferencing last week. The status of service deliveries under maternal and child health, family planning and immunisation was reviewed by Dr G Dewan, the health director of Chandigarh. Tablet devices have been provided to healthcare workers for discussing steps to improve services in Covid times. Now that’s what we call a positive side-effect.Debate over term of PU students’ councilA debate over the term of Panjab University Campus Students Council has been going on among student organisations. The term of the council ended on May 31 but a student party submitted to the dean, students’ welfare, that the members of the council are still using their stamps and official positions while approaching the university authorities. However, Chetan Chaudhary, who was the PUCSC president, refutes the claims, saying the outgoing office-bearers were only helping students in difficult times. A former DSW said it’s better to talk to former elected representatives and take student organisations into confidence before any such initiative.Musical chairs at UT education departmentIt’s a game of musical chairs at the UT education department. Just as Harbir Anand was set to take charge from Alka Mehta as district education officer (DEO), former DEO Anujit Kaur filed an application in the Punjab and Haryana high court, seeking a departmental promotion committee (DPC) meeting.

The CBI also alleged that one of the accused invited a large crowd to gather in the village to protest against Singh’s death.The accused and his supporters also visited the police control room at Sanvrad Tiraha and threatened the local police administration to accept their demands.While several people gave hate speeches to instigate the crowd. The angry mob also pelted stones at police vehicles, and many police personnel sustained injuries.Some of the police personnel was allegedly held captive in a house and the mob also snatched their arms, including .9 mm service pistols, cartridges along with mobile phones and other items.Nagaur’s superintendent of police’s (SP) official vehicle was also torched by the mob.“A charge sheet has been filed after a thorough investigation.

Bunty then went into a drug-induced stupor. After some time, Gurjant saw what had happened. He slit Bunty’s throat in a fit of rage.”DSP Kamaljit Singh said Gurjant left the house after killing Bunty.A case under sections 302 (murder), 450 (house trespass), 148 (armed with deadly weapon) and 149 (every member of the unlawful assembly) is already registered at Patti City police station.Police said Lal and his four sons were involved in drug peddling and nearly 50 cases were registered against the family members.

The first domicile certificate was given to 70-year-old Deepo Devi. She had retired long back as a sanitation worker from Jammu Municipal Corporation (JMC).”“We are very happy that we have been finally considered as citizens of J&K. There is new hope among our youth, who can now also become officers and get jobs in other departments,” he added.Bhatti slammed Kashmir-centric parties like National Conference and PDP for opposing the new domicile law. “Since the beginning they have been saying that these are attempts to change the demography. Instead, they were the ones attempting to make it a Muslim state. They never allowed equal rights to us, be it Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah or Mehboob Mufti,” he said.He said the domicile certificates have brought an end to their slavery by the successive Kashmir-centric regimes.Brought from Gurdaspur and Amritsar in 1957 on the assurance of then J&K ‘Prime Minister’ Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed that they will be given permanent resident status and other privileges, Valmikis ended up working as sweepers for 62 years irrespective of their educational qualifications.West Pakistani Refugees Action Committee (WPRAC) chairman Labha Ram Gandhi said it was all due to sincere and human approach of the BJP-leadership that they got the right to live a dignified life.“Except betrayals by previous governments at the Centre as well as in the erstwhile J&K state, nothing was done to solve our issues,” Gandhi said.West Pak refugees were not considered residents of the state since 1947. No jobs and no admission in professional courses were given to them. They had fled Pakistan during partition from Sialkot and settled in Jammu, Samba and Kathua districts.The process of distribution of domicile certificates under the new domicile law was kick-started here with the distribution of over 50 domicile certificates by Jammu divisional commissioner Sanjeev Verma during a special camp.Speaking on the occasion, Verma said with the handing over of domicile certificates, the long-pending demand of the public has been fulfilled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/communities-deprived-of-equal-rights-for-years-in-j-k-finally-get-domicile-certificates/story-HoUJGIFNqvuUahpE26rM3O.html

Later, 19 people were convicted by a trial court in connection with the Muzaffarpur shelter home case.In its fresh application filed in the top court, the CBI has said that in pursuance to the November 2018 order, it had taken over probe of remaining 16 shelter home matters and lodged 12 regular cases and four preliminary enquiries spread over 10 different districts of Bihar, including Patna, Gaya and Bhagalpur.“Enquiry of all four preliminary enquiries has also been completed and no evidence proving commission of criminal offences could be gathered in the said preliminary enquiries,” it said.“However, evidence of gross negligence was found on part of public servants and NGOs running the shelter homes for which CBI reports have been sent to the Government of Bihar for taking departmental actions against erring government officials and cancellation of registration of NGOs and blacklisting them and their office bearers for future social/governmental contracts,” the application said.It said the CBI reports and notes have been forwarded to chief secretary of Bihar for taking action against erring public servants, including several district magistrates, in these cases.The CBI has said that enquiries have been completed in these 17 shelter home cases, except the ongoing further probe in two matters.In its application, the probe agency has sought the apex court’s permission for utilizing services of team members of the investigating team of Bihar’s shelter home cases for other official works, saying the “assigned task has been completed except further investigation in Muzaffarpur shelter home case and short stay home, Motihari case”.The top court, in its October 2018 order, had said that CBI’s investigating team of the Muzaffarpur shelter home case should not be changed without its permission.In 2018, the apex court had said that report of TISS, which was also given to the Bihar government, had raised grave concern about 17 shelter homes in the state and the CBI must look into all of them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bihar-shelter-home-casesrecommended-action-against-erring-officials-cbi-tells-sc/story-IzRCaqeZOcKYSyf2pwiIgI.html

27-06-2020||Chandigarh||Doaba farmers bring back migrant labourers for sowing, transplanting paddy||In absence of migrant labourers, who left for their native states amid the Covid-19 pandemic, farmers in the Doaba region had little choice but to hire high-priced local labour for sowing and transplanting paddy. Some enterprising farmers also made arrangements to bring back the migrant labour. Paddy transplantation had begun in the state from June 10, which was ten days in advance because of labour shortage. However, due to shortage of migrants, most of farmers are still transplanting paddy and also paying higher wages than the previous years.Transplantation traditionally begins on June 20 and lasts around 20 days.Jagjit Shergill of Bajwara village in Hoshiarpur said he had hired local village women for sowing paddy. He is paying each labourer Rs 4,000 per acre.“I decided to transplant paddy on 10 acres of my land against last year’s 20 acres as this year the process is proving to be very costly. There is shortage labour and there is no clarity on the MSP rate of paddy,” Shergill said.He said that migrants were demanding Rs 5,000 per acre while he had paid them Rs 3,100 last year.Harmanveer Singh, a farmer from Sultanpur Lodhi in Kapurthala district, said all his labourers had gone to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and the ones that had stayed behind were demanding Rs 4,500-Rs 5,000 for sowing paddy as compared to last year’s Rs 2,800-Rs 3,200.‘LOCALS TAKE LONGER, WASTE PADDY’ “I hired some local people who had recently lost the job and paid them Rs 3,500 per acre. Though they took more time and also wasted some of the paddy but it solved my problem,” Harmanveer said. He owns 60 acres of land.Sukhpreet Singh of Mahal village in Jalandhar a group of farmers from the village had collaborated to bring 33 migrants from Bihar. It cost Rs 4,500 to bring each labourer.“Covid-19 has made paddy sowing very expensive for farmers. We have almost spent double the amount we usually spend,” he said.Avtar Singh of Bajuha Khurd village in Jalandhar said many small farmers had hired unemployed locals to sow paddy. “Paddy transplantation is still under progress on my 40-acre land. I have hired at least 20 local villagers and also brought in seven migrant workers after spending Rs 45, 000 as they are experts,” he said.A driver, Sundeep Kumar, who was fired by a leather factory, said, “I was unable to find work. My family is dependent on me so I have been working in fields for the last two weeks and have earned Rs 500.District agriculture officer Naresh Gulati said some farmers had brought back the migrants while some had opted for direct sowing by machines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/doaba-farmers-bring-back-migrant-labourers-for-paddy-sowing/story-LGwCnUJ1J9GuNbx07VB2MO.html

The government of India has centrally procured and distributed 11.11 lakh N95 masks, 6.81 lakh PPE kits, 44.80 lakhs HCQ tablets to Delhi. Besides, 425 ventilators were allocated to Delhi and have been delivered to various hospitals in the city. Delhi has 34 Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH), 4 Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHC), 24 Dedicated Covid Centers (DCCC) to treat Covid-19 patients based on their severity. Thus, a total of 62 facilities in Delhi are engaged in treating Covid-19. The number of these facilities is being increased on a daily basis, the ministry said in a statement. A high-level committee set up by Union Home Minister Amit Shah on June 21 had suggested Delhi government that every case of death should be analysed from the point of when the person was admitted to hospital and from which area was the deceased brought. The panel said it should be very important to find if the deceased was in home isolation and if he or she was brought to the hospital on time. Every death has to be reported in a timely manner to Government of India. All hospitals have been given strict directions that there should be no delays in handing over the dead bodies to their next of kin and performing last rites of Covid-19 deceased patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/diagnostic-material-for-4-7-lakh-rt-pcr-tests-50k-rapid-antigen-tests-given-free-to-delhi-by-icmr/story-b6olYyYG2BsoonXEzdkKqJ.html
27-06-2020||City||Yashwant Sinha joins Bihar fray, attacks Nitish||PATNAFormer BJP leader Yashwant Sinha on Saturday announced he would work for a new political alternative in Bihar to replace the Nitish Kumar government due to its “utter failure on multiple fronts”.Assembly elections are due in Bihar in October-November.Sinha, who quit the BJP in April 2018, said at a press conference that the new formation was in the process of making and would contest elections on the agenda of ‘Is Baar Badlo Bihar’ (Change Bihar this time)’. “The government will have a big role to play in the making of a better Bihar and the present dispensation is incapable to doing it, as has been proved in the last 15 years. The focus is on replacing it with a government that is sensitive to people’s needs,” he said.A former Union finance minister, Sinha did not rule out the possibility of contesting the elections himself. “I don’t cross my bridges before I get to them. I am known for surprising at times. I have decided to devote the rest of my life for changing Bihar after the worst ever humiliation I have had to face due to heart-rending sight of migrants from Bihar returning to the state braving untold miseries,” he said.Flanked by former ministers in the Nitish Kumar cabinet, Renu Kushwaha, Narendra Singh, former Jehanabad MP Arun Kumar, five-time MP from Jhanjharpur Devendra Prasad Yadav, former MP Purnmasi Ram, former union minister Nagmani and a host of other leaders, Sinha said more leaders were in touch with him to give the people of Bihar a viable alternative, “as they were badly looking for one after feeling cheated”. Former Bihar Speaker Uday Naraayan Choudhary is also said to be in touch with Sinha.“If this is the condition of Bihar 73 years after independence that 40 lakh people have to move out every year in search of livelihood, it speaks a lot about governance. If Bihar remains at the bottom of the human development index (HDI) index and poverty index, has the lowest per capita income of Rs 47,541, which is one-third of the national average, and the education and health sectors remain in a deplorable state, there is not much left to explain,” he said.Himself an alumnus of Patna University, Sinha said the university had been left with barely one or two teachers in several post-graduate departments, as most of the posts had remained vacant in Bihar’s higher education institutions. “In the last fiscal, barely 33% of the rural road construction target could be completed. Bihar has barely 1.5% share in industries across the country. And to top it all, there is all-pervasive corruption, with money disappearing from treasury,” he said, in a direct attack on the Nitish Kumar government.He also urged the Election Commission to consider the prevailing situation before deciding whether it would be proper to hold elections. “Virtual campaigns and digital voting are mere tools of cheating the people. It will be heavily loaded in favour of rich parties. Besides, one never knows what shape Covid-19 would take. It may peak in October-November. Right now, there is hardly any testing in Bihar, but the figure has gone past 8,000. There also could be a flood situation in 21 districts. The EC has to take a call taking everything into consideration,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/yashwant-sinha-joins-bihar-fray-attacks-nitish/story-s5X6lZ33kfULQmb6lFvVxL.html

27-06-2020||Pune||Pune’s bargain bazaar decides to go China-free: Tulshibaug traders unveil local produce plan||Tulshibaug market, one of the city’s oldest bargain bazaars, announced a “China-free” plan on Friday, a plan to not sell any made-in-China item.Three hundred shops and 300 registered hawkers make up this city shopping centre for bargain deals on every type of knick-knack, imported and otherwise; with cosmetics, toiletries, household and decorative items the fast movers.Tulshibaug exited lockdown last week, and against the backdrop of the China aggravation along the LAC in Ladakh, which resulted in the 20 Indian soldiers losing their lives, traders have decided to boycott all Chinese-made items.“When the incident happened, and our soldiers were brutally killed, since that day there has been a lot of anger amongst all the shop owners and traders in Tulshibaug. So we decided to appeal to all shop owners to boycott Chinese goods - buying and selling - in the market. Thirty per cent to 35 per cent of ‘Made in China’ goods come into the Tulshibaug market every year,” said Nitin Pandit, secretary, Tulshibaug market shop owners association.Pandit claims that the process of becoming a “China- free Tulshibaug” has begun, within some traders destroying their current made-in-China inventory.The process to completely de-link from China is expected to take at least six months.“Tulshibaug is known for its prices and varieties. There is demand for Chinese products. Due to lockdown, almost every trader is now facing a financial crisis as there was no business for three months. Despite this, traders who have stopped buying Chinese products are working on options for local production of goods which were coming in from China. For this, traders have approached manufacturers in Ulhasnagar and Gujarat.” Pandit added.Pandit says the Tulshibaug market as a whole suffered a loss of at least Rs 40 crore during the 90+ days of lockdown.“Some Chinese inventory already exists and some goods have already been dispatched from China, so it is not possible to immediately stop. We have appealed to traders that if possible, destroy the goods or return it to the distributors. As a last option sale will be allowed of current stock. All the traders have agreed, but it will not happen overnight. In the next six to eight months, Tulshibaug will be a China-free market,” Pandit said, adding, “On the association level we will help our traders in all possible ways to be self-dependent.”Pandit estimates that a ballpark figure for the price differential between manufacturing in India and manufacturing in China will be between 35 per cent and 40 per cent.That is a cost some traders are willing to bear.Fifty-five-year-old Babu Navale, a shop owner at Tulshibaug, destroyed all his China goods.Navale said: “There is lot of anger against China. Being a proud Indian I decided to stop selling and buying any kind of Chinese goods. I had several Chinese products in my shop like plastic bottles, utensils, laundry bags, mosquito-repellent rackets; around Rs 25,000 worth of goods. I threw it all in the garbage. I am ready to suffer a loss in business, but will never buy and sell Chinese products.”Annually the total value of goods imported from China into the Tulshibaug market is between Rs 25 crore and Rs 30 crore, according to the Tulshibaug market shop owners association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-s-bargain-bazaar-decides-to-go-china-free-tulshibaug-traders-unveil-local-produce-plan/story-7oF29Ifs1sMoKcBwrUKfuK.html

Now, the organisation is planning Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) for employees above 55 years of age.The PMPML is calling it a precautionary step as the elderly are at a greater risk to the Covid-19 infection. The decision has been taken by the PMPML board of directors, and a committee has been formed to set guidelines to carry out the procedure.On the other hand, PMPML employees and worker unions are not happy with the decision. Most employees are not willing to opt for VRS and want to work in any other alternate government office.PMPML chairman and managing director (CMD) Nayana Gunde, said, “The organisation is undergoing financial losses, secondly the Covid-19 infection is spreading in the city and elderly employees are at more risk. Therefore, we are going to give them VRS. There was a discussion on thr issue in the recent board of directors’ meeting. Now, a committee has been formed to make guidelines to execute the VRS. Once the committee submits its report further procedure will start.”When asked whether it will be optional or compulsory retirement for the employees, she said, “It has not yet been decided whether we will compulsorily send them on VRS or it will be optional. According to the committee report, a decision will be taken.”There are around 10,000 employees and workers in PMPML currently consisting of drivers, conductors, mechanical workers and clerical staff. Out of them, around 2,100 employees are above the age of 55.Sunil Nalawade, vice-president of PMPML nationalist workers’ union, said, “It is unacceptable that the management will directly send workers on voluntary retirement. If they are planning anything related to elderly workers’ retirement, they should consult and take suggestions from the worker unions and we will give our inputs. If the scheme is beneficial to workers, it will definitely be considered and we will accept it. But if there are any glitches and financial losses to the workers, then it will not be accepted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/staring-at-losses-pmpml-plans-voluntary-retirement-for-employees-aged-above-55/story-0HEAex90CTyf4ZlxaYEcKL.html

27-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi Gymkhana Club still reeks of ‘imperial mindset’: NCLT||The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in a scathing interim judgment on Saturday said the Delhi Gymkhana Club still reeks of an “imperial mindset”, as it continues to embrace the colonial past and panders to the privileged and elites in keeping with its Lutyens’ Delhi setting.“It is on record that soon after independence, the word “Imperial” is wiped off from the club’s name. But, I doubt whether it has been wiped off from its mindset,” stated the judgment, accessed by HT. “It is not a barb against the club…. there is no space to commoners unless they are positioned on the highest pedestal …” On Friday, the NCLT had asked the government to appoint two nominees to the club’s governing body and also set up a five-member committee to look into the alleged “irregularities”, officials told HT. The judgment said the club, which is in the midst of a takeover battle by the Centre, would be allowed to make no “new policy decisions, appoint new members and/or begin new constructions”.September 7 has been set as the next date of hearing, when the five-member panel will submit its report. The club, which shares a wall with the Prime Minister’s residence at 7 Lok Kalyan Marg, has been under investigation for around three years. The government has cited “parivarwaad” (nepotism), financial irregularities, misuse of allocated land and issues related to membership as the primary reasons behind its move to acquire the club. The Union Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) filed a petition, seen by HT, with the NCLT seeking to take over the club.The government had asked for the dissolution of the governing body and the appointment of an administrator as interim relief. Taking on the claim over the “public interest”, argued by the club as baseless since the matter pertains to the club management, the NCLT said “…the club members make rules for themselves…. the club is sitting on the monies of the public in the name of entrance fees or registration fees. On the contrary, the club is 24x7 open to the family members of permanent members from generation to generation… The club is enjoying 27 acres of land of the state in the prime area of Lutyens’ Delhi…”.It added: “It is coined by the petitioner as a “parivar” club”.“It is legally untenable,” said a Gymkhana official, requesting anonymity.“What ‘public interest’ can be prejudicial once it is purely a private club. All private clubs are governed by their own rules. It is not a public place such as the Lodhi club or a marketplace where the government can even levy parking fees. NCLT is also not clear how the government can take back the lease given to the club in ‘ perpetuity’ in 1928 and the lease fees the club has been paying since then,” he argued.But, the NCLT’s interim order said: “…anybody can infer the club has come into existence for the then ICS (Indian Civil Service) officers. That time it was mostly for the English to chill out in the evenings. Obviously, it is their culture; therefore they cherished their culture wherever they ruled. That’s why bars and ballrooms have come up. Of course, Indian kings had it in a different way. Of course, a king is a king, whichever country it is.After the English left this country, this ruling elite culture has seeped into independent India through the usage of this club, once you get into it, it is always relishing. It is hardly possible to come out of this kind of culture. It could be that this club must have come into the hands of Indian officers after the English left India. After Independence, democracy governed by the Constitution has come into force. Since democracy has become reality, this club should have left its doors ajar for many, if not all, because not only has it bar and ballroom and swimming pool with roof, but has a wonderful library and many other sports facilities.”The NCLT also slammed the club for violating Article 14 -- the right to equality – as enshrined in the constitution.“The club counsel has argued that the right to form associations and clubs is a fundamental right under Article 19. Any interference with the affairs of the club is a violation of fundamental right endowed upon this association, whether it is right or wrong. But there is another article, that is Article 14, which speaks volumes about equality, when any organisation is basking in the past glory on the state largesse, whether the shade of Article 14 will fall upon the said organisation or not? I believe yes. It is no doubt if anybody comes in the way of forming clubs or associations, or continuation of those associations, such right shall not be truncated, but the right of forming association cannot be extendable to say that it has the right to use acres of land of the state for lazing around...”The NCLT said that the “club all through its submissions, through its counsel, keeps on reminding me it is a privileged club, and it is a privilege that is selectively given to high-level officers, judges, eminent persons, businessmen. The shadow over the club is it is so obsessive of its privilege”. It said: “In the name of privilege, the club has erected an unbuilt wall around it and not permitting the people to have that whiff which they have been having for decades.”The NCLT observed that the membership of the club changes on a “purely selective basis”. “It is an ongoing process in this club that membership is purely on a selective basis, the selection basis is changing from time to time, though permanent membership is limited, under the cover of dependents, green card holders, the use of club premises (UCP) holders; the number of people using the facilities of the club is increasing without any restrictions. But the people, who applied for membership, were kept waiting because the dependents became members by fast-tracking their applications,” the judgment stated.“This club has been enjoying 27 acres of the land of the state which costs around thousands of crores. All this shows imperial behaviour and the insensitiveness of the club against the tenets of democracy … the discussion is about inequity and prejudice,” it added.“Self-elevation of some people under the cover of positions, eminence, richness, and inheritance as a privilege of the elite is anathema to the fundamental rights,” it stated.“And in turn prejudicial to the public interest, when somebody appropriates largess of the state for pastimes and whiling away the time drinking wine and whisky in a sprawling land, I believe it is a mockery of the system,” it added. “In AoA (Articles of Association), there is a provision of a membership category called “Distinguished”, which the club redefined it as the Eminent category. High Court/Supreme Court judges, Bharat Ratnas, Nobel laureates, ambassadors of foreign countries, Central Cabinet ministers, and civil servants, etc; fall in that category. Besides, government secretary, director-general of police, chairman of the railway board, chiefs of Intelligence Bureau, National Investigation Agency & Research & Analysis Wing, lieutenant-generals of armed forces also belong to this category,” said the Gymkhana official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-gymkhana-club-still-reeks-of-imperial-mindset-nclt/story-i8xFTancOfWOE6OYlsnBhJ.html

27-06-2020||Pune||Dressing up Khadakwasla as tourist destination: tender deadline extended||The state irrigation department, under whose purview Pune’s main water-source, the Khadakwasla dam operates, has allowed the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC) to undertake a “beautification and development”project on 28 acres in the immediate area surrounding the dam. MKVDC has already invited tenders for the project.The Maharahtra government has developed the green spaces around dams at Jayakwadi and Koyna, but not with a private developer.V P Patil, executive engineer at the Khadakwasla dam, said, “This is a pilot project and 28 acres owned by the irrigation department is to be developed by a private entity on a build, operate and transfer (BOT) basis. The land will be handed over to the developer for 30 years. We are looking at an amusement park, museum, gift shops, planetarium, banquet hall, ball room, resort and restaurant, multi-purpose pavilion, and village theme park.”Patil said, “The object of this proposal is to beautify Khadakwasla dam and to utilise the unused excess government land available in the vicinity of the dam. It would be developed for tourism purposes and to maximise revenue for the water resource department.

Later, 19 people were convicted by a trial court in connection with the Muzaffarpur shelter home case.In its fresh application filed in the top court, the CBI has said that in pursuance to the November 2018 order it had taken over probe of remaining 16 shelter home matters and lodged 12 regular cases and four preliminary enquiries spread over 10 different districts of Bihar, including Patna, Gaya and Bhagalpur.“Enquiry of all four preliminary enquiries has also been completed and no evidence proving commission of criminal offences could be gathered in the said preliminary enquiries,” it said.“However, evidence of gross negligence was found on part of public servants and NGOs running the shelter homes for which CBI reports have been sent to the Government of Bihar for taking departmental actions against erring government officials and cancellation of registration of NGOs and blacklisting them and their office bearers for future social/governmental contracts,” the application said.It said the CBI reports and notes have been forwarded to chief secretary of Bihar for taking action against erring public servants, including several district magistrates, in these cases.The CBI has said that enquiries have been completed in these 17 shelter home cases, except the ongoing further probe in two matters.In its application, the probe agency has sought the apex court’s permission for utilizing services of team members of the investigating team of Bihar’s shelter home cases for other official works, saying the “assigned task has been completed except further investigation in Muzaffarpur shelter home case and short stay home, Motihari case”.The top court, in its October 2018 order, had said that CBI’s investigating team of the Muzaffarpur shelter home case should not be changed without its permission.In 2018, the apex court had said that report of TISS, which was also given to the Bihar government, had raised grave concern about 17 shelter homes in the state and the CBI must look into all of them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-shelter-home-case-cbi-recommends-action-against-erring-govt-servants/story-1Zn6JOk8J0O6UCwRPoDE1J.html
27-06-2020||Chandigarh||Government is not ending MSP system, says Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar||Defending the recent ordinances brought by the Union government in the form of agricultural reforms, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Saturday categorically said the system of procuring farm produce at minimum support price (MSP) will continue.Addressing the BJP’s virtual rally through videoconferencing, Tomar said the Congress party in Punjab was misguiding the people by telling them that the new reforms meant the end of the MSP system.“This is a bundle of lies. No such move has been taken. MSP thi, hai aur rahegi,” asserted Tomar.Claiming that new reforms will prove to be a game changer for farmers, the Union agriculture minister said the reforms will level the playing field for farmers.“These reforms allow farmers to sell their produce wherever they want. Earlier, farmers were compelled to sell their crop at state government facilities to licence-holding players. Under this process, farmers were being duped as they were not getting a fair price for their produce. If the manufacturer of a pen is allowed to sell his product wherever he or she wants, why should farmers not be allowed to sell their produce wherever they choose?” said Tomar.‘FARMERS WILL NOT BE TAXED OUTSIDE MANDIS’ Now a farmer from Bathinda can sell his produce in Kolkata as farmers can move inter-state without paying tax, Tomar said. The Union minister said farmers will always have the option to sell their produce at the state government’s markets. “But outside these mandis, farmers will not be taxed,” said the minister.The reforms have been brought to increase private investment in the agriculture sector so as to make farming a more lucrative business, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/government-is-not-ending-msp-system-says-union-minister-narendra-singh-tomar/story-PKbfx7xGgVxbck3CFk4wbO.html
27-06-2020||Delhi||After swarms of locusts descend on Gurugram, Delhi on high alert||With swarms of locusts descending on neighbouring Gurugaon, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Saturday asked the national capital’s south and west districts’ administrations to remain on high alert, said officials.According to an official who attended the meeting, the minister was informed that a small swarm of locusts has also reached the Asola Bhatti area in South Delhi. The Agriculture Department has been asked to issue a detailed advisory to all district magistrates and sub-divisional magistrates to deal with a possible locust attack in Delhi. The minister also asked Forest Department to play DJs, beat drums and dhols to repel the swarms of locusts, the official said. Rai also asked officials of the Agriculture Department to make field visits to areas close to Gurgaon. The development secretary, divisional commissioner, director, agriculture department and district magistrates of South Delhi and West Delhi attended the meeting, the official said. Earlier in the day, the skies over many parts of Gurgaon turned dark as swarms of locusts descended on the town. The migratory pests, however, are likely to spare the national capital for now, said officials. The swarms of locusts, spread across two kilometres, moved from west to east. They entered Gurgaon around 11.30 am, K L Gurjar of the Locust Warning Organisation, the Ministry of Agriculture, told PTI. The pests, he said, were headed towards Faridabad and Palwal in Haryana. Alarmed at the invasion by locusts, which settled on trees, rooftops and plants, many residents of Gurugram shared videos from their high-rise perches. In May, India battled a devastating desert locust outbreak. The crop-destroying swarms first attacked Rajasthan and then spread to Punjab, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. According to experts, broadly four species of locusts are found in India -- desert locust, migratory locust, Bombay locust and tree locust. The desert locust is considered the most destructive. It multiplies very rapidly and is capable of covering 150 kilometers in a day. This insect, a type of a grasshopper, can eat more than its body weight. A one square kilometer of locust swarm containing around 40 million locusts can in a day eat as much food as 35,000 people. Experts blame the growing menace of desert locusts on climate change. They say breeding of locusts is directly related to soil moisture and food availability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/after-swarms-of-locusts-descend-on-gurugram-delhi-on-high-alert/story-ncefb01gfJF5Weog4c0HcK.html
27-06-2020||Mumbai||‘Remember 1962’: Sharad Pawar’s brutal snub to Rahul over Chinese ‘intrusion’||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar said on Saturday matters of national security should not be politicised and one must remember what happened after the 1962 war when large tracts of land were occupied by the Chinese.Pawar’s comments came in response to a question about Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s charge that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had surrendered Indian territory to the Chinese aggression. The Congress party, led by its former president Rahul Gandhi, has been taking jibes at the Centre since the June 15 violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley.Also Watch | ‘Why were 20 soldiers killed if China hasn’t occupied our land?’: Sonia Gandhi It wants PM Modi to clarify whether China has intruded into India in Ladakh.The NCP president said the first time something like this happened was after the 1962 war when the neighbouring country had laid claim on large swathes of Indian land.Also Read: Galwan clash ‘huge mistake’ by China, world already fighting Covid-19: Experts“We can’t forget what had happened in 1962 when China occupied 45,000 square kilometres of India’s territory. While making these allegations, one should also look at what had happened in the past. This is an issue of national interest and once should not bring in politics here,” the former defence minister said while speaking to reporters in Satara.Pawar’s NCP is an ally of the Congress and they are part of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government led by the Shiv Sena.The senior politician was referring to the disputed Aksai Chin area, which is controlled by Beijing but claimed by New Delhi.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488km Line of Actual Control (LAC). While China claims Arunachal Pradesh as Southern Tibet, India asserts that the dispute covered Aksai Chin area which was occupied by China during the 1962 war.The NCP chief also said the Centre cannot be blamed for the standoff at Galwan Valley. “Our soldiers tried to push back Chinese army men when they tried to encroach upon Indian soil. To say this is the failure of anyone or of the defence minister isn’t correct. Had our army not been on alert, we wouldn’t have known Chinese assertion,” he said.“The scuffle itself means that we were vigilant else we would have been caught unaware. Hence, I don’t think such allegations are fair to make,” he added.Pawar also cited the agreement between India and China when two nations decided not to use guns at the LAC.Twenty Indian soldiers of 16 Bihar Regiment, including its commanding officer, were killed following a clash with Chinese troops at Galwan Valley on June 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/remember-1962-sharad-pawar-s-brutal-snub-to-rahul-over-chinese-intrusion/story-NFPOPjXXm1XGPF3AcL0lBM.html

The next date of the case’s hearing will be on July 7, and the court has asked TMC authorities to maintain the status quo until then.On June 2, over a 100 homebuyers of the My City Complex had clashed with TMC authorities when the latter visited the residential complex to conduct a survey in a bid to requisition two high-rise towers as a quarantine facility for high-risk Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-orders-inspection-of-residential-towers-taken-over-by-tmc-for-quarantine-facility/story-lpXmYX2TEuHnyetsywtTCO.html

27-06-2020||Chandigarh||Locust attack in Haryana sets alarm bells ringing in Punjab||After receiving reports of locust invasion in parts of Haryana on Friday, Punjab’s agriculture department is also keeping a look out for the short-horned grasshoppers that leave a trail of destruction in their wake. Top officials at the Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), a subsidiary of the central ministry, have said that there are no signs of such an infestation in Punjab, but officials say it is tough to trace the exact movement of the swarms during monsoon and thus it is best to stay alert.South Malwa districts such as Fazilka, Muktsar and Bathinda, which share the boundary with Rajasthan and Haryana, are believed to be most vulnerable.Farmers in the region are in a tizzy as cotton has been sown and paddy sowing is also in full swing. State agriculture director Sutantar Kumar Airi said locust invasion in Punjab could potentially affect the crops.“We are ready for any emergency situation caused by locust swarms. Special monitoring teams are working in different districts in coordination with central agencies and adjoining states,” he said.Fazilka chief agriculture officer Manjit Singh said tractor-mounted sprayers, fire engines and manpower were on standby. They will be used to spray insecticide on the migratory pests.“We are keeping a close watch on the locusts. Early this week, swarms were reported in Gharsana in Rajasthan’s Sri Ganganagar, about 250km from Abohar town in Fazilka, a vulnerable region, but they did not enter the district,” said the official. LWO deputy director and national coordinator on mitigating locust attacks KL Gurjar said locusts move according to wind direction and during the monsoon wind directions change frequently.“After entering parts of Mahendragarh and Rewari on Friday, this morning swarms were seen flying towards Palwal and Gurugram. Swarms of locust can cover a distance of 150 km a day and if the wind direction does not change, they may hit Uttar Pradesh soon. So far, Punjab is not under threat but the state has been asked to stay fully prepared,” said Gurjar.“The prevalent climatic conditions are worrying as locusts breed when the weather is humid,” he said. “Locusts are expected to return to Rajasthan to mature and lay eggs. The desert locusts normally live and breed in semi-arid regions. So far, we have been able to contain the insect invasion significantly,” said Gurjar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/locust-attack-in-haryana-sets-alarm-bells-ringing-in-punjab/story-FNtQA8aJqSimdE5FzAaJHL.html
27-06-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana issues high alert after swarms of locusts enter Rewari, Gurugram||The Haryana government has issued a high alert after a swarm of locusts entered Rewari and Gurgaon districts, with officials on Saturday asserting that all necessary measures have been taken, including deploying tractor-mounted spraying facilities.Swarms of locusts from Rajasthan after passing through Mahendragarh district of Haryana settled in various villages of Jatusana and Khol blocks in Rewari district on Friday evening.On Saturday, they went towards Jhajjar and entered Gurgaon district with insects covering the skyline in some parts of the “millennium city”.Alarmed at the invasion of the locusts, which settled on trees, rooftops and plants, many residents of Gurgaon shared videos from their high-rise perches.  At many places in Gurgaon, residents kept their windows closed to prevent the insects from entering homes.Also read: Delhi govt calls emergency meeting after locust swarms seen in Gurugram“It was a huge swarm of 5 km in length and 2 km in width which passed through Mahendragarh and settled down in Rewari. In the night, this swarm was near Jatusana block,” Additional Chief Secretary, Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department, Sanjeev Kaushal told PTI. “Heavy insecticide spray was done during the night and early morning. About 35 per cent of the swarm was destroyed, but the rest which was still uge in number took off from there and crossed Jhajjar district and then got on to Gurgaon,” he said. Kaushal said that according to the inputs he had received from the central government, “it is likely that from the wind velocity and direction, it (locust swarm) will cross Palwal district and may then head towards Uttar Pradesh”.About the measures taken by the Haryana government, he said, “We are fully on alert, our districts have been alerted. We have sufficient quantities of insecticides stored there. We have tractor-mounted spray guns and these were deployed wherever necessary.” Officials said when locusts entered Rewari district, they settled on trees and standing crops like cotton and bajra, which had been recently planted.Any damage caused was being assessed, they said.To take stock of the situation, state Agriculture Minister J P Dalal visited Rewari and enquired from villagers and officials about the damage caused by locusts.Talking to reporters in Rewari, Dalal said Mahendragarh, Bhiwani, Jhajjar and Rewari districts had been put on alert on Friday itself.About Rewari district, he said 15 fire tenders, besides several tractor-mounted spray facilities were pressed into service during a night-long operation, which was carried out and personally monitored by Deputy Commissioner Yashendra Singh.Dalal said even experts from the central government who visited Rewari to take stock of the situation had appreciated the timely measures taken by the district administration.Replying to a question, he said that while the locusts are air-borne there was not much that could be done and measures are taken only after they have settled down on trees and in fields.In many villages where locusts were spotted, the farmers beat ‘thalis’ (plates) and other utensils in a bid to ward off the insects away while local administration deployed tractor-mounted spray facilities.Officials from the agriculture and other departments were keeping a close watch while supervision teams had been formed to tackle the situation. Village-level WhatsApp groups too had been formed to keep the farmers informed, the officials said.A month ago too Haryana had issued a high alert after locust swarms had attacked crops in neighbouring Rajasthan and a few other states, but luckily the insects had moved away from the state.Earlier in January, locusts were spotted in some villages in Punjab’s Fazilka and Muktsar districts but were effectively contained then.Locusts, popularly known as ‘‘tiddi dal’‘, are short-horned grasshoppers with highly migratory habits and voracious feeding behaviour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-issues-high-alert-after-swarms-of-locusts-enter-rewari-gurugram/story-91PKQJKPazu7Wpju9UAxyH.html

27-06-2020||Chandigarh||Struggling due to labour shortage, Himachal’s apple growers demand higher MSP||Himachal orchardists are dealing with shortage of labour amid the apple harvesting season, anticipating losses they have asked the state government to increase the minimum support price. The apple season is scheduled to begin in a week but the orchardists are still scrambling to arrange manpower to help harvest and pack the fruit. For decades, the fruit growers have been dependent on the services of Nepalese labourers. This year, the labour could not return to the hill-state in wake of the pandemic. The Nepalese labourers have been the backbone of the state’s Rs 4,500-crore apple economy. They help with all kinds of strenuous work, including digging pits, planting saplings, spraying chemicals, plucking, packing and transportation. Representatives of the Federation of Apple Growers Societies (FAGS) conglomerate of different fruit grower associations had recently met chief minister Jai Ram Thakur and apprised him of their difficulties.‘70% CROP MAY ROT’ FAGS convener Rajeev Chauhan said, “If the state government fails to provide labour, 70% of the crop will rot in the orchards and the government has told orchardists that it will not be able to provide labour and they must make their own arrangements.” The apple growers’ association had asked the government to approach the Nepalese government through the ministry of external affairs to allow Nepalese labour to travel to Himachal Pradesh for harvesting apples. They had also urged the horticulture minister to arrange labour from Bihar, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.“Now, farmers will not be able to repay their bank loans. The state’s economy will also be affected,” Chauhan said, adding that the apple economy was the key contributor to the state’s gross domestic product (SGDP).Chauhan further said that the government should buy apple crop under the minimum support price (MSP) scheme instead of the market intervention scheme (MIS) during these difficult times. “The MSP for apple should be at least ₹20 per kilogram as the apple production cost comes around ₹15 per kg,” he said. ‘MEAGRE INCREASE IN MSP’ Chauhan said that the government had increased the MSP by only 50 paise per kg to ₹8.5 per kg, which was not sufficient. “There has been a sudden 30% increase in the prices of trays used for packing apples,” Chauhan said. Chauhan said the federation had also raised the issue of charging ₹20 per box. “Agriculture minister Ramlal Markanda has assured us that he will look into the matter,” said Chauhan. He said the government had fixed labour rates in the market at ₹5 per box, for which the federation was thankful to the authorities. “The matter of weather-based crop insurance was also raised in front of the chief minister, who assured us that a high-level meeting will be called soon and all the demands and suggestions of the farmers will be taken into account,” Chauhan said. Congress demand state govt to increase apple support price State Congress president Kuldeep Rathore on Saturday hit out at state government’s decision to hike apple support price by 50 paise and has demanded the state government to raise support price by at least ₹20 per kilogram.In a statement issued by Rathore said that orchardists have already suffered huge losses due to hailstorms and lockdown, therefore, the government should increase support money by ₹20 per kg in order to provide relief to them.He also demanded the state government pay the outstanding amount to orchardists and said that they need money so that they can make arrangements for transportation of their produce to markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-labour-shortage-himachal-s-apple-growers-demand-higher-msp/story-xF4te5XJbWa5YxWt5gIdRP.html

Locusts can fly up to 150km daily and a one square km swarm can eat as much food as 35,000 people in terms of weight in a single day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-calls-emergency-meeting-after-locust-swarms-seen-in-guragram/story-LCGcon4Lxt6AnkRY04NwOP.html

27-06-2020||Delhi||5 weapons helped Delhi fight Covid-19, says Arvind Kejriwal as he thanks Centre||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said authorities in the national capital are using five weapons in the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the city, which has seen a surge in cases, as he thanked the Centre for lending a helping hand.Arvind Kejriwal, while addressing a virtual news conference, said increasing the number of beds, testing and isolation, pulse oximeters and oxygen concentrators, plasma therapy and survey and screening has helped the Capital to tackle the respiratory disease.“When the lockdown was lifted, we estimated that Covid-19 cases will increase. But, the rise in cases was much more. We had two options—either bring back lockdown or fight corona. We took people’s opinions as well who said the lockdown wasn’t an option,” he said.Initially, people had trouble getting beds which in turn increased the number of deaths, the chief minister said.Also read| Serological survey to begin in Delhi today: All you need to knowThe Delhi government, he said, decided that all the big hospitals will reserve at least 40% of their beds for patients and then converted hospitals into dedicated Covid-19 facilities. Hotels have been also attached with hospitals to ramp up the number of beds, he said.“The number of beds has increased significantly in the last one week. There are 13,500 beds in Delhi right now and of which 6,500 are occupied,” Kejriwal said.Next, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader, was testing and isolation. Kejriwal said action against errant laboratories and increasing the number of tests have helped.“In the first week of June, there were around 5,000 tests daily. Now, we are conducting nearly 20,000 tests every day. No other state is doing this. I want to thank the central government for helping us and giving us the first antigen kits. Now, we have ordered over six lakh antigen kits,” he said.He had said earlier in the day that Capital is following a strategy of “very aggressive testing and isolation” and conducted the highest number of Covid-19 tests in a single day on Friday.Also read| These states have extended Covid-19 lockdown: Here’s a list“Delhi conducted highest no of tests in a singly day yesterday- 21,144. We have increased testing 4 times. Delhi now following strategy of very aggressive testing and isolation,” Kejriwal had tweeted.Pulse oximeter and oxygen concentrators have also helped and the government has given this device to every patient under home isolation. “Pulse oximeter is working as a security cover for Covid-19 patients,” Kejriwal said.“It helps them check oxygen levels at frequent levels and alert us if there’s anything serious… We have bought nearly 4,000 oxygen concentrators. Our attempt is to make oxygen available on every Covid bed in every hospital in Delhi,” he added.The fourth weapon is plasma therapy and Delhi has paved a way for the entire country, he said. “Plasma therapy is being used by many now. This doesn’t work for patients who are on ventilators or who have multi-organ failure but helps those with moderate symptoms,” he said.Survey and screening is the fifth weapon to tackle the highly-contagious disease. He was referring to the serological survey of 20,000 people being conducted in the Capital from Saturday.“We want to especially thank the Centre, which has helped us in every step in this fight. We want to thank the media which pointed to our mistakes and we could rectify them,” he said. “Our victory is sure but we cannot say when. Corona will be defeated and Delhi will win. All these five weapons are proving to be very effective,” he added.Delhi, which is overtaken Mumbai in terms of the number of Covid-19 cases, has seen a surge in infections prompting the Centre to ramp up efforts to contain the spread through a five-pronged approach.There are 77,240 Covid-19 cases and 2,492 deaths in the national capital so far, according to the Union health ministry’s coronavirus dashboard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-lists-5-weapons-in-fight-against-covid-19-thanks-centre/story-8gDZ8JM4ecqjZNHWp62POI.html

27-06-2020||Delhi||A Rainbow of inclusivity: Trans community welcomes move by NMRC to rename metro station||In a press release dated June 24, Noida Metro Rail Corporation announced that the sector 50 metro station will be named Rainbow, dedicated to the transgender community. “NMRC has started this initiative with very noble intentions with the aim to empower the Transgender Community. NMRC will also be providing them with up employment opportunities to help them become self reliant and pave the way for their healthy inclusion and participation in the society”, reads the release from Ritu Maheshwari, Managing Director, Noida Metro Rail Corporation Ltd.We speak to some people from the trans community and what this move entails.“I welcome the move; We are part of the rainbow and the name does justice to it. But then I would like to see what is the workplace policy, what kind of inclusion they are talking about, and whether they are including trans man and trans woman at the same level. It is important how they train and sensitise people,” says Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi, Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Kinnar Akhada and trans rights activist. A planned approach and well-informed outlook will help take things forward in a more positive, inclusive manner, believes Abhina Aher, a trans rights activist working with India HIV/AIDS Alliance. “This is the first ever station in India, and even globally of this kind. But I feel they need more information and knowledge in order to make it a more trans-led station. They should engage people from the community. We have to go beyond just naming a station; tokenism won’t do. I really want to see people from the trans community to work there and lead the way. A community-friendly approach needs to be in place,” she says. She also suggests adding visual elements, such as the colours of the trans flag at the metro station, will help create a connect. “There are more trans people like me who are working with the government and are available to help them take this forward.Read: Noida gets a Rainbow station to recognise transgenders’ place in societyAryan Pasha, a lawyer by profession and the first Indian trans man to take part in national body-building competitions, feels that there is a need for sensitization and education both within the community and outside it. “The name that they had decided on giving it before, She Man, is derogatory and would have given the public another chance to bully us. The name Rainbow covers the entire spectrum of the LGBTQIA+ community. If you own and accept your identity, the world cannot bully you,” he says. As far as workplace policies are concerned, he feels that security should be a top priority. “Trans women should be given security the way female employees are. Even for trans men, employees say that you are biological male, why do you need security. Their preferred names and pronouns should be kept in mind while addressing them. Trans people should not be judged at any workplace. They should be given equal facilities as given to other employees,” he adds.Alex, a Delhi-based trans woman says that the employment opportunities will open more doors for the community, who are otherwise shunned at interviews. “I have a degree in civil engineering but I am jobless. Interviews pe bahut gande tareeke se dekhte hain aur sirf trans hone ke basis pe reject kar dete hain. I hope things change with this move.

27-06-2020||Bhopal||BJP in a fix over Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s rallies in 24 assembly constituencies||The BJP’s Madhya Pradesh unit is in a dilemma over organising chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s rallies in all the 24 assembly constituencies, which will witness by-polls in the coming months, as the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases are on the rise in the state, according to party leaders.They said social distancing norms will be difficult to ensure even if the party gets permission to hold the rallies from the district administrationLeaders said the Bharatiya Janata Party is planning to hold the rallies in all the 24 constituencies by mid-July as Election Commission of India is expected to announce the dates of election by July end.“Organising of virtual rallies was discussed in the party meetings and it will be held too given the present Covid situation but what worries the party at this moment is dissidence within the party at the local level in many of these constituencies which is difficult to quell through virtual rallies only,” a senior BJP leader familiar with the party’s plan said.Of the 24 assembly constituencies in 14 districts, 16 fall in Gwalior-Chambal region including five in Morena district alone. Twenty-two of the 24 seats fell vacant in March when Congress MLAs resigned from the state assembly in a rebellion against the then chief minister Kamal Nath. All these former MLAs are loyalists of Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia. who quit Congress to join the BJP on March 11.“A traditional rally with the thin presence of people will send out a wrong message about the party’s base and the CM’s popularity but with a large gathering, it will be difficult to ensure social distancing among participants. Another problem is how to get permission from the district administration as the state government itself has banned in the state social, political and religious gatherings and programmes,” the BJP leader cited above said. At the same time, said the leader, “The party leadership wants party workers meetings in every constituency in a bid to mobilise them for the election but given the Covid situation several party leaders are scared as to how to protect themselves from corona if such meetings are held and they have to attend these meetings.”Notably, on Thursday, the BJP’s national president JP Nadda had emphasised on the importance of virtual rallies.“Whereas in traditional rallies a gathering of even 2 lakh persons is considered an impressive gathering through virtual rallies the party could reach out to lakhs and lakhs of people,” Nadda had said.A second BJP leader said, “Virtual rallies are in the offing as a part of the election campaign but the party wants at least one traditional rally in each of the constituencies to be addressed by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and other leaders.”The districts which will witness by-polls include Morena, Gwalior, Bhind, Datia, Shivpuri, Guna, Ashok Nagar, Sagar, Anuppur, Raisen, Dewas, Dhar, Indore and Mandsaur. Many of these districts are hotspots. On Thursday, the district administration in Morena sealed the Madhya Pradesh-Rajasthan border after a spurt in Covid-19 cases. “As of now, the party is planning virtual rallies for the entire state to be addressed by our leaders, including chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and state BJP president VD Sharma, on the completion of one year of the NDA government at the Centre in its second term,” Rajneesh Agrawal, the BJP spokesperson of the state unit, said.“The dates will be announced soon. I am not aware of any such rally about state assembly constituencies,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/bjp-in-a-fix-over-shivraj-singh-chouhan-s-rallies-in-24-assembly-constituencies/story-4yBd3Ch4kPVZlZI2FSVzsJ.html
27-06-2020||Chandigarh||A helper at home who never smiled||The domestic helper never smiled. Not even a flicker of excitement or exuberance on her face. I did not engage her in lengthy conversations nor did she ever approach me with any complaints. She suited me well. She was living in a village close by. She spoke less, was efficient and took few leaves. Her predecessor was chatty, retorted back and was full of stories.I loved it when my new helper appeared at the gate on the dot at 3.30 pm, when I came back home with my daughter. My bones weary, my body tired, I would bless her for opening the heavy iron grill gate to let the car in. She would dutifully carry the shopping of the day from the car as I unlocked the house.Since the onset of the lockdown my family had barred her from entering the house. They dreaded the invisible Covid-19 invading the home territories. It was everywhere and so pervasive that it inundated all counter arguments.And then came the curfew. Even the inane walks to and from home were not allowed.I had to let her go. The household chores got divided among the family members and things went on smoothly. No one complained about the helper’s absence. My mind too seemed to have made peace with this scenario. How easy was it to pluck people out of one’s life and move on as if they never existed!But all the work I was doing during the lockdown made me wonder how I had developed the strength to do all the household chores that I had never imagined I could manage.How lazy I must have been for piling my work on my helper when I could, whereas, without her, I was managing all the cleaning, mopping up, doing the laundry and dishes. Though every family member had been instructed to clean his or her own plate, bowls, spoons and glasses to avoid a pile-up in the sink, someday rules would be forgotten and regulations thrown to the wind. Then I would have to deal with the chaos of unwashed dishes.Cleaning the plate, scraping off the grime from others’ plates left without a rinse in the sink, was not easy. I found it repulsive, wondering if I had rinsed used utensils before giving them to my helper to wash.I could make out why she never smiled.When it was so difficult for me to do the chores at home, dealing with my own family, how difficult would it have been for her to toil in several homes, for people in no way related to her.I could say for sure I missed her and was waiting for her to come back and start from where she left. I hoped I would be more considerate with her than I was before the lockdown days. Now, I have decided that I will not overburden her with work that I can easily do myself. I will make sure I rinse the utensils before putting them in the sink.I can be kind with my words and gestures and not careless and unresponsive. I might not be able to change her life, but I am hopeful that these little things might add up to bring the smile back on her face.The writer is a Hoshiarpur-based veterinary officer||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/a-helper-at-home-who-never-smiled/story-aZ8fYSo5x58xxkSP7hibFL.html
27-06-2020||Chandigarh||Vini Mahajan replaces Karan Avtar to become Punjab’s first woman chief secy||Senior IAS officer Vini Mahajan on Friday took over as the Punjab’s first woman chief secretary, replacing Karan Avtar Singh.A 1987-batch IAS officer, Mahajan is the wife of state’s director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta. She will also hold the additional charge of principal secretary, personnel and vigilance. Singh, a 1984-batch IAS officer, was shunted out of the top bureaucratic position just two months before his superannuation, due on August 31. Singh is tipped to be the first chairman of the Punjab Water Regulatory Authority set up by the state government.Singh has been posted as special chief secretary, governance reforms and public grievances, according to the government order. The officer’s transfer is being viewed in the corridors of power as direct fallout of his run-in with the cabinet ministers who demanded his sacking for his ‘attitude and demeanour” at a meeting held to discuss the excise policy. He had to apologise to ministers for his behaviour and was also divested of the additional charge of financial commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/vini-mahajan-replaces-karan-avtar-to-become-punjab-s-first-woman-chief-secy/story-epBiaw7z2XpbdYifnom1KL.html
27-06-2020||Mumbai||Students of Mumbai’s Institute of Chemical Technology confused over e-exams||A notice issued by the Institute of Chemical Technology in Matunga, Mumbai, over its plans to conduct online exam left students confused.On June 5, institute registrar RR Deshmukh issued a notice to students announcing that the exams for final-year undergraduate students and final-year Masters in Science (MSc) students will be held between the last week of June and July 15. The notice further said that the first to third-year undergraduate students as well as first-year MSc students will have to take their exams from July 15 to 31. It also stated that the schedule of the exams will be declared a week before the exam dates and that the examination will be conducted in electronic format (e-exam) for all the students.A second round of paper-based or e-exam will be held in August for students who could not take the tests in July. The mode of the second round of examination will be determined based on the Covid-19 situation, the notice said. However, it did not give any further clarity on how the e-exam will be conducted.“The guidelines for E-examination will be prepared by a committee,” read the notice by Deshmukh.Students, particularly from the rural areas, are not sure if they can take the e-exam, as they do not have the facilities for it.“Some of us live in villages and don’t have a computer or broadband connection,” said a second-year student, on the condition of anonymity.“We have a defined pattern for electronic examination. Students can take the test from their homes and will not need any internet connection. We have informed the students of the process,” said VK Rathod, controller of examination of ICT.Following the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus on March 23, students were asked to vacate the hostels and go home. “Many of us left in a hurry and have left our college notes in the hostel. How do we prepare for the exams? This new notice on exams is stressful,” said another student.In the first week of May, state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant scrapped all exams, except those for final-year students. Thereafter, on May 30, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced that final-year exams will be cancelled and students will be promoted based on their past performances. However, the state’s rules are not applicable to ICT, which is a deemed university.Meanwhile, the institute plans to begin classes for the new academic year from August 1. Extensive online classes will be held if the lockdown continues and laboratory classes will be deferred until physical classes can resume, said Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/students-of-mumbai-s-institute-of-chemical-technology-confused-over-e-exams/story-Edb6LV7flQaSmFKs2Z1hPL.html

Four of them are asymptomatic, but they have all been admitted to hospital. They contracted the virus from an accused who was arrested for rioting. One of the assistant police-inspectors (API) nabbed five people for rioting at a public place five days ago. As a part of the protocol, all of the accused were tested for Covid-19, of which one man’s result cam positive three days ago.Senior inspector L Sariputre said, “The API started showing symptoms, following which we tested six other personnel too. All of them were tested positive, following which they were admitted to hospital. We asked five other officers to quarantine themselves. The police station was also sanitised immediately after the first report came positive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/seven-cops-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-badlapur/story-YFgRBVbxLAO6YLN0mg4fCJ.html
27-06-2020||Chandigarh||With only three plasma units left, PGIMER invites donors||As the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) moves ahead with clinical trials for convalescent plasma therapy by recovering six more patients, the institute is grappling to maintain adequate inventory as only three plasma units are left now.Though 187 patients have completed 28-day recovery in the city, only six have come forward to donate plasma to the institute so far.Dr Pankaj Malhotra from the department of internal medicine, PGIMER, said, “If patients will not donate plasma, the department will not be able to maintain a proper inventory. Those critical patients who really require the plasma will not be helped.”Dr Malhotra said former plasma donors can be requested to repeat the donation, and if the donor agrees for a repeat donation, it may be scheduled after at least two weeks after the first donation.At PGIMER, around six patients with Covid-19 pneumonia who enrolled for the clinical trial of plasma therapy have been discharged after recovery.“A majority of recovered patients are asymptomatic during Covid illness even though they tested positive on the RT-PCR test. Some donors, however, do not agree to donate as it may not be comfortable for them. Patients from adjoining areas like Punjab and Haryana who have recovered should also come forward for the cause.”The trial suggests that in order to be eligible as a donor for plasma, they should be more than 18 years of age, males or nulliparous (the medical term for a woman who has never given birth; weighing more than 55kg). Besides, the donor should have had a prior diagnosis of Covid-19 documented by a laboratory test (RT-PCR) with symptoms of (at least) fever and cough, and complete recovery for at least 28 days prior to donation.The plasma therapy is aimed at assessing the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma to limit complications in Covid patients. In this trial, antibodies from the blood of patients who have recovered from Covid-19 are used to treat severely-infected patients. However, the exact role of this therapy in the treatment of Covid-19 is still debatable and hence, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had decided to conduct a multicentric study to clarify its role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/with-only-three-plasma-units-left-pgimer-invites-donors/story-abltZSp9A4SZVwKN3NXoxH.html
27-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab’s power couple calls the shots||The ascent of Vini Mahajan, a 1987-batch Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, to the top bureaucratic position in Punjab is a story of many firsts.Mahajan is the first woman chief secretary of the state. She is the wife of Punjab Police chief Dinkar Gupta. This is the first time any power couple is simultaneously serving as the chief secretary and director general of police (DGP), the topmost administrative and police posts, in the state, and perhaps anywhere in the country.Gupta, also a 1987-batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, was appointed as head of the state police in February last year. He was empanelled by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) last month for the post of director general or DG equivalent at the Centre.Another first is that for the first time, both Punjab and Haryana’s chief secretaries are women. In Haryana, 1983 batch IAS officer Keshni Anand Arora, who is not the first woman CS there though, currently holds the top bureaucratic position. Also, Mahajan will have more than four years as the chief secretary if she continues in the office till her superannuation in October 2024.The 1987-batch bureaucrat, who is a mother of two, owes her ascent to her professional credentials and varied experience in the field and at the Centre where she handled economic ministries.An economics graduate from Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi, Mahajan did here postgraduation from the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Calcutta, where she was placed on the ‘roll of honour’ and later also received the ‘Distinguished Alumnus Award’. Mahajan, a decisive and no-nonsense bureaucrat, had served in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) from 2005-12, handling matters relating to finance, industry, commerce, telecom and IT. Her father, BB Mahajan, was also an IAS officer of the Punjab cadre.SUPERSEDES 5 IAS OFFICERSMahajan has been appointed as the chief secretary, superseding five IAS officers senior to her. They include KBS Sidhu (1984), Arun Goel, C Roul, Kalpana Baruah Mittal and Satish Chandra (all four from 1985).Sidhu, the senior-most bureaucrat in Punjab, is due to retire in July 2021. Both Goel and Roul are currently on central deputation whereas Mittal is additional chief secretary, cooperation, in the state government. Chandra, who has three months left for superannuation, is additional chief secretary, home.KARAN AVTAR’S UNCEREMONIOUS EXITKaran Avtar Singh, who is due to retire on August 31, has been posted as special chief secretary (SPS), governance reforms and public grievances. Though Singh had apologised to the cabinet ministers in the presence of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on May 27 to settle the unprecedented run-in with the minister, his shifting did not come as a surprise to several of his colleagues in the state bureaucracy.Congress ministers and MLAs, who called a truce as the chief minister stood by the chief secretary, were not happy with the IAS officer’s continuation in the top post. They were pressurising the CM to remove him and the recent government notification to adopt the two-rule fixed tenure rule for IAS officers also riled them up.Singh’s new posting as SPS after he remained the chief secretary for more than three years has not gone down well will some of his bureaucratic colleagues who feel that he had just two months left for superannuation and should have opted for premature retirement.FIRST WOMAN DC OF PUNJABIn 1995, Mahajan was the first woman IAS officer to be posted as deputy commissioner (DC) in Punjab. She was posted as DC, Ropar, where she carried out a highly effective ‘Total Literacy Campaign’, for which Ropar received the National Literacy Award for best performance in the country. She has served in various capacities in the state, including MD, PIDB, and as the first director, disinvestment. She was appointed as chief administrator of the new Anandpur Sahib Development Authority in 1997, and also CEO, Anandpur Sahib Foundation, for the organisation for the tercentenary celebrations of the birth of the Khalsa held in 1999. She served as the chairman of the celebrations committee for the 550 year celebrations of Guru Nanak Dev in 2019. Prior to being appointed as chief secretary, she was additional chief secretary, investment promotion, industries and commerce, information technology, governance reforms and public grievances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-s-power-couple-calls-the-shots/story-EzMNjtr9lvXuMkDCWygSBM.html
27-06-2020||City||Taxi, auto unions want services in Mumbai to resume||In the first online meeting held by the transport task force, rickshaw and taxi unions demanded for the immediate resumption of services in Mumbai. “We are thinking about how the services can be resumed in the coming days. A decision will be taken after discussions with the CM and the cabinet,” Maharashtra transport minister Anil Parab said. He also said three panels will be formed to put forth the demands of autos, taxis, school and private bus operators before. “In the past three months, several vehicles did not ply on the roads. The main demand of the unions was to exempt them from taxes, increase their insurance period and the tenure of their vehicle loans, etc. Three different committees for auto and taxis, private bus and school bus operators, as well as for trucks, tempos and tanker operators will be formed. The committees will put forward their demands before the government,” the minister added.A 13-member transport task force, headed by Parab was formed on Tuesday to address the transportation issues in the state and suggest measures on effective operations during amid the coronavirus outbreak. “There have been huge losses to rickshaw drivers, and many do not have money to survive. We have asked the government to resume all modes of transportation from June 28. The drivers should also be paid ₹10,000 during the entire period of the lockdown.” said Shashank Rao, leader, Mumbai Autorickshawmen’s Union.The autorickshaw unions also asked the state government to release seized autorickshaws and the cancellation of e-challans during the lockdown period, along with waving the interest of the loans taken by the autorickshaw drivers in Maharashtra.Meanwhile, the black-and-yellow taxi drivers’ union in the city asked the state government to increase the number of commuters permitted inside taxis.“The business of black-and-yellow taxi drivers from office goers and traders is 70%, while passengers from airports and railway stations form just 10% of the business. Under the current scenario, it is very difficult for the drivers to survive. We asked the government to allow office goers to commute by taxis as well as to increase the number of passengers to three and in cases of families to four,” said Al Quadros, leader, Mumbai Taximens’ Union that has more than 25,000 drivers under it. A senior transport department official said that if more employees are allowed at offices, then the state would have to allow autos and taxis to ply. “With the trains shut, it would be a burden on the bus services if offices open with more employees. Therefore, the state would have to permit auto-taxi services to resume. The government is still deliberating on these issues. Even if autos and taxis are back on the roads, they will ply with less capacity. The onus of sanitisation and safety should be ensured in a way that it doesn’t burden the auto and taxi drivers financially,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/taxi-auto-unions-want-services-in-mumbai-to-resume/story-QbpVSK8HdF5j3suDskuJaO.html

27-06-2020||Chandigarh||No liquor to be served in Chandigarh hotels till June 30||The UT administration on Friday decided against the serving of liquor in restaurants and banquet halls till June 30.The decision was taken during the daily review meeting chaired by Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore.The representation of the hotel owners’ associations to let them serve alcohol during functions was discussed. Though this has been allowed in Punjab, the UT has decided to wait till the present lockdown ends on June 30.On June 8, restaurants and banquets halls were allowed to open albeit with caveats. Representatives of the hospitality industry contended that not allowing liquor was akin to additional financial burden.The hotel and restaurant industry has been one of the worst hit in the city after the Covid-19 pandemic forced the establishments shut for close to three months. Even now, claim hotel and restaurant owners, the occupancy rate is quite low. As restaurants have been instructed to close down by 9pm, many owners have opted not opening their premises at all.Surprise inspectionsFor containing the spread of the covid-19 cases in the city from visitors coming to the city, the UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said in the meeting that he had already instructed the police and other officials to implement more strictly social distancing norms, the wearing of masks, etc. Surprise inspections will be made in all public places including Sukhna Lake to penalise violators, he added.UT deputy commissioner Mandip Singh Brar said in the meeting that in the last two days, more than 10,000 people had come into the city via trains, road and flights. He also said that 8,972 people had registered themselves on the official website, giving details of their travel plan and accommodation in Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-liquor-to-be-served-in-chandigarh-hotels-till-june-30/story-aTBl3jnLOu438Or5J71X4M.html
27-06-2020||City||Bains brothers booked for violating lockdown orders, stopped from entering Chandigarh near SSP’s residence in Mohali||The Mohali police on Friday booked brothers MLA Simranjeet Singh Bains and Balwinder Singh Bains for allegedly violating the lockdown rules.The brothers along with Gurpreet Singh, alias Jimmy, Didar Singh and others were booked after they conducted a cycle rally with a gathering of around 200-225 persons.A case was registered under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and the Disaster Management Act 2005 at Mataur police station.High drama was also witnessed at Mohali-Chandigarh border after the brothers and their colleagues of the Lok Insaaf Party were stopped from entering Chandigarh near the SSP’s residence in Phase 3A here.The party wanted to proceed to the chief minister’s (CM’s) residence on bicycles during a rally ‘Kisan Bachao, Punjab Bachao Rosh Yatra’ that started from Amritsar two days ago.Bains brothers were adamant, but the police said no more than three people could travel together in a car. That’s when the brothers got on the bicycles to reach the CM’s residence. Assistant superintendent of police (ASP) Neha Yadav led them to the CM’s residence after they met duty officer tehsildar Suresh Kumar. Before leaving for the CM’s residence, Bains brothers said, “Our protest rally ‘Kisan Bachao, Punjab Bachao Rosh Yatra’ is purely in interest of the farmers of Punjab opposing the three ordinances passed by the Centre. These ordinances will ruin the future of the farmers in Punjab. Agriculture and farmers are under threat not only from the corporates, but also from the government. We will be presenting a memorandum in this regard to the Punjab CM.” The rally attendees were also booked by the Phagwara administration for allegedly violating the Covid-19 protocol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bains-brothers-booked-for-violating-lockdown-orders-stopped-from-entering-chandigarh-near-ssp-s-residence-in-mohali/story-CfjqG0nbhP0Pm7IgQ5Zh1O.html
27-06-2020||Chandigarh||Students, parents in Chandigarh left uncertain amid cancellation of board exams||Parents, students and teachers have been left with questions and uncertainty as board exams for Classes 10 and 12 rescheduled by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) were cancelled on Thursday. Although, most parents welcome the cancellation amid surging cases of Covid-19, outgoing batches are dealing with ambiguity regarding their future despite clarifications released by CBSE on Friday. Deepika Bahari, a parent whose child studies in Class 12 said, “It is not just about the board exams. It’s also about the entrance examinations to follow like NEET and JEE. Such last minute announcements are nothing but harassment for parents and children.”In the notification released on Friday, the board said, “Students of Classes 10 and 12 who have not completed all their examinations will be assessed based on their previous performance.”HS Mamik, president of the Independent Schools’ Association (ISA) said, “I think public pressure lead to CBSE cancelling board exams.” “At the same time, the Karnataka government has agreed to conduct the exams and held them. In the end, whatever is convenient to the government is acceptable,” he added.GD Bakshi, administrator of Kabir High School, Sector 26, said, “We have no choice. In these trying times, some extreme steps have to be taken. Both the CBSE and Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) being the national boards have to take a call on everyone’s behalf.”“Although the lockdown has been eased and one should not panic, but, Covid-19 is here to stay. Till when can we put our lives on hold? Someone has to show courage and take bold step,” he added.On adopting fresh guidelines for evaluation, CBSE in its notification added, “For students who have appeared for examinations in more than three subjects, the average of the marks obtained in the best three subjects will be awarded in subjects whose examinations have not been conducted.”Whereas, “For students who have appeared for examinations in only three subjects, the average of the marks obtained in the best two subjects will be awarded in the subjects whose examinations have not been conducted.”For a handful of students, “who have appeared in the examinations in only one or two subjects, their results will be declared based on performance in the appeared subjects and performance in internal or the practical project assessments.”CBSE has also said that, “These students will also be allowed to appear in optional examinations conducted by CBSE to improve their performance, if they wish to do so.”Siddharth Chopra, an educationist associated with an NGO, Samarthya, working in government schools, said, “CBSE has put good effort into designing the assessment scheme. One disclaimer is that any scheme designed to address this challenge will have its own pros and cons. I think CBSE should have ensured that all students are promoted. Failure at this stage might have extreme implications for students and their parents.”Nitin Goyal, president of the Chandigarh Parents’ Association said, “The new evaluation pattern is not quite fair, but appears to be the best alternative to close the 2019-20 academic session at once. Therefore, whenever the colleges take admissions after 10+2, merit should be evaluated on the basis of entrance exam alone and not on the basis of marks obtained in 10+2.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/students-parents-in-chandigarh-left-uncertain-amid-cancellation-of-board-exams/story-IZEmMieKB0XGbcY94TAANO.html

27-06-2020||City||Ganpati idols’ height capped at 4ft by Maharashtra government||After meeting representatives of Mumbai’s public Ganeshotsav mandals, the state government on Friday issued a press release, stating that the height of Ganpati idols are capped at 4 feet. The state is expected to issue a detailed notification on the standard operating procedure soon. Every year, many public Ganeshotsav mandals install idols which are more than 20 feet tall. CM Uddhav Thackeray previously appealed to the mandals to keep the celebrations for the 11-day festival beginning on August 22 a low-key affair amid the Covid-19 outbreak, to ensure fewer crowds and social distancing norms.Thackeray held two meetings last week with all the stakeholders, including Ganeshotsav mandals, sculptors and civic authorities to decide on various issues pertaining to the festivities, including the height of the idols, the size of pandals and measures to keep the festivities a simple affair to prevent crowding.During the meetings, the mandal representatives were asked to reduce the height of idols at pandals to 3 feet this year. The representatives however, requested the state to permit them to install the idols which are at least five feet tall.“In the backdrop of rising Covid-19 infections, we should organise the festivities in a subdued manner this year. The virus has not spared religion, culture or customs and thus the government is forced to put curbs on religious celebrations. Though tall Ganpati idols and decorations in Mumbai and Pune attract many from across the world, we will have to abide by the social responsibility.”Sudhir Salvi, secretary, Lalbaugcha Raja Ganeshotsav Mandal, one of the biggest pandals of the city, said they will stand by the government decision but the final decision would be announced after their general body meeting on June 30.“We already said we will abide by the government’s decision, but we need to officially take the decision during the executive committee meeting. We have our meeting on Tuesday and the decision about the festivities this year amid the Covid-19 outbreak will be taken then,” he said.The state government already directed the mandals to reduce the size of the pandals and avoid immersions at seas. The mandals also requested the government to simplify the process of permissions from the authorities and to treat last year’s permissions valid this year for the construction of the pandals. Though the state government did not specify the material to be used for the idols, it is insisting to make idols from clay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ganpati-idols-height-capped-at-4ft-by-maharashtra-government/story-k95p3WpXxR4iN1NKYm0i5L.html

Cycle sales in the city have also gone up as more and more citizens are opting for sustainable transport that ensures social distancing.The Smart Commute Foundation, founded by city’s first bicycle mayor, Firoza Suresh, is currently in the process of selecting bicycle councillors. A panel consisting of experts from urban planning will scan and select candidates by June-end. They will be councillors for the next two years.“The vision is to make Mumbai the cycling capital of the world by 2030. We want to promote cycling and make Mumbai a bicycle-friendly city. The councillors will be expected to interact with stakeholders that include civic authorities, corporators, MLAs, NGOs, schools and colleges look at setting up docks, cycling paths and also create a zone in each ward to undertake training,” Suresh said.The foundation has started a campaign “Cycle Chala City Bacha” telling citizens the importance of cycling.Shahid Shaikh, who owns three cycle shops in the city, said all cycles are sold out after he re-opened the shops in June. “If we used to sell 100 cycles before the lockdown, we are selling close to 300 now. People are also ready to pay and wait for high-end cycles to be delivered, which was never the case before,” Shaikh said.The Centre and state government have also appealed to citizens to take up cycling for short distance travel. In its Mission Begin Again notification released on May 31, the Maharashtra government encouraged cycling as a form of physical exercise “as it automatically ensures social distancing”. Cities like London, Dublin and Sydney are being reshaped to accommodate more cyclists and pedestrians on its roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-goes-the-social-distance-to-get-24-bicycle-councillors/story-K2OSlZIy2KHfeNS9g5JyhL.html
27-06-2020||Chandigarh||Corona effect: Chandigarh administration, civic body lose big on revenue||Two months of lockdown, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, has cost the Chandigarh administration a whopping ₹342 crore in tax collections. The revenue generation from goods and service tax (GST), excise and value added tax (VAT) has plummeted by 71% for April and May in comparison to the same period last year.Also hit hard by the lockdown, the municipal corporation, which is already struggling with financial crunch, has cut its projected revenue for 2020-21 by 20%.The lockdown was imposed in the city on March 22, with strict restrictions on the movement of people and goods. Subsequently, restrictions were eased in phases, allowing some commercial activity, but it was only under Unlock 1, which started on June 1, that business and industrial units were allowed to open.“In addition to major taxes, the administration has also lost revenue from non registration of properties and other fees and charges collected by public-dealing offices, such as the registration and licensing authority and the estate office,” said a senior UT official. All these offices were closed for more than two months.GST COLLECTION WORST-HITOf the three major receipts of the UT, GST registered a decline of 75% for first two months of the current financial year in comparison for the same period last year. Last year, the collections were ₹230.5 crore, while this year they are ₹57 crore. GST is collected on goods and services except fuel (petrol and diesel) and liquor. Excise collections (mainly from liquor sales) fell by 69% from ₹160 crore last April-May to ₹50 crore for the same period. The revenue from VAT fell to ₹28 crore this year from ₹87 crore last year, a decline of 68%.Ajoy Kumar Sinha, UT finance secretary, said: “The revenue slump is for first two months of the financial year, when all commercial activities were closed. Now, with the business activity picking up, we expect recovery in tax collections. The final June tax collection report, to be out by next month, will show the scale of recovery that has set in.”Developmental works to be carried out by the administration will not to be affected because of revenue fall, he said.The UT in May increased the VAT on petrol and diesel, and also increased excise on liquor sales to augment its revenue. Significantly, the central government has directed a cut by 20% in spending for the fist quarter for the current financial year.MC IN DIRE FINANCIAL STRAITSOn June 29, MC officials will be presenting revised projections of its revenue receipts for 2020-2021 before the General House. The civic body is expecting to earn around ₹80 crore less than the budget estimates. A major shortfall of around ₹50 crore is expected in water collection. Revenue from community centre bookings is also expected to down by ₹4 crore.“The MC will not carry out any additional development, except for the works for which the money has been earmarked and allotted by the UT already. Even then, the MC might find it difficult to pay salaries to its employees,” said KK Yadav, MC commissioner.The MC has a budget of ₹1,472 crore against revenue estimates of ₹661 crore (which includes ₹340 crore as the UT’s grant-in-aid).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/corona-effect-chandigarh-administration-civic-body-lose-big-on-revenue/story-xHT4jMtxYbj2FPQ7cSnuRK.html

Around 14,000 students are set to take the Class 10 and Class 12 board exams from the Pune region, which includes all schools and private candidates from Maharashtra, Goa and Diu and Daman. The examination will be held simultaneously for students registered in centres across India. While the board again postponed its practical exams – which were to be held between July 2 and 10 – until further orders on Friday, it is yet to take a call on the theory papers, which are to be held from July 17 to August 13. A senior official from the centre said that a decision to conduct the exams rests with the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development.Parents said that with the cases of Covid-19 surging, especially in cities such as Mumbai and Pune, it is a huge risk for students to appear for their exams.“Most of the students are allotted centres far from their homes because they are at Kendriya Vidyalayas, which are not too many in the city. My son got his centre at Colaba, though we stay in Andheri. Travelling so far for the exam is a huge risk and poses several challenges, owing to lack of public transport,” said the parent of a Class 12 student.“Till then [further notice] exams are on and wherever centres are remotely located from learner’s place, the learners can apply for the exam centre change through e-services,” stated the board’s official response.Students with special needs also find it difficult to get writers. “No parent would allow their child to take a risk and travel. Due to this, students with special needs are under immense pressure even before the exams,” said another parent from Malad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nios-students-left-in-the-lurch-as-board-yet-to-decide-on-class-10-12-board-exams-scheduled-for-july/story-nuV4o4cfxdoBUJVsvF498I.html

According to the proposal, the institute has sought a ₹150-crore grant every year for a period of five years. But the Covid-19 lockdown has proven a dampener for the institute’s plan. “We have not received any update on that proposal yet.

Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray wrote on Friday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting him to instruct All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), Council of Architecture (COA), Pharmacy Council of India (PCI), Bar Council of India (BCI), National Council of Teachers Education (NCTE) and National Council for Hotel Management and Catering Technology (NCHMCT) to endorse the state’s decision and issue necessary guidelines.The state also decided to award degrees to the final-year students pursuing professional courses on a formula based on their performance in previous exams.“Considering the current Covid-19 situation in the state, the state disaster management authority in its meeting held on June 18 decided not to conduct final-year examinations for non-professional courses as well as professional courses and award degrees based on a formula decided by the universities. Further, an option would be given to students who want to take exams whenever it is feasible to be held. It was also decided to get decision in respect of professional courses to be endorsed by the respective apex authorities as these courses are regulated by them,” the letter by Thackeray stated.The CM also highlighted how holding the exams would cause more difficulties to the authorities in the state. “As you are aware, the number of Covid-19 patients is increasing in all major cities such as Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Pune Metropolitan Region, Nashik, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Akola... The present atmosphere is not yet conducive to conduct examinations and classes.

27-06-2020||Mumbai||1,500 of 1 lakh Ayush doctors reported for Covid-19 duty in Maharashtra||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has criticised the state health department for not taking action against Ayush (Ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha and homeopathy) doctors who are not reporting for Covid-19 duty.Despite Ayush doctors being called upon to join the medical response to Covid-19 since April, only around 1,500 Ayush doctors have reported for Covid-19 duty. Of these, 500 have been posted at various Covid-19 care centres (CCC) in Mumbai to take care of asymptomatic individuals and patients with mild to moderate symptoms. “So far, we have a list of 1,500 Ayush doctors who have been stationed all across the state on Covid duty,” said Dr Sanjay Mukherjee, secretary of medical education and drug department (MEDD).Data from the Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) shows that there are more than 90,000 registered allopathy doctors in the state. However, to provide treatment and care to growing number of patients, state health officials said more are needed as many doctors are above 55 years old and therefore may not be assigned to Covid-19 duty.To arrange for additional doctors, the state government in April launched an online curriculum for Covid-19 care, designed by All India Institute of Medical Sciences, for Ayush doctors. The training imparted basic knowledge on handling Covid-19 patients through video and those that cleared the video-led course and its online examination, were given a certificate.Kuldeep Kohli, director of Ayush in Maharashtra, said 1 lakh registered Ayush doctors opted for the online test. “As requested, their names have been sent to DMER [Directorate of Medical Education and Research]. After that, we don’t know how many have been posted on Covid-duty. Our responsibility was to send them the list of qualified doctors,” said Kohli.Dr Avinash Bondewe, president of IMA, Maharashtra, said, “In May, the medical education department stated their requirement of 25,000 doctors to handle Covid-19 cases. We suggested that Ayush doctors be included. But we (allopathic doctors) are now being blamed for shortage of doctors.”Last month, the Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) issued a circular that mad 15 days of Covid-duty mandatory for registered allopathy doctors. The medical education department also threatened to cancel licenses of doctors who violate the directive. “We had to face the heat and criticism from doctors for the circular.

The court also directed the state to inform the procedure adopted to manage and dispose the bodies of Covid-19 patients and asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to update on the progress of the probe into the video of Sion hospital.The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice MS Karnik, while hearing the PIL through video conferencing on Friday, was informed by advocate Rajendra Pai who represented Shelar that the viral video of Sion hospital “shocked the conscience of Mumbaiites”. Pai also submitted that there were unconfirmed reports of patients being forced to share their beds with dead victims in some hospitals.When asked about the progress of the probe regarding the video that went viral, senior advocate Anil Sakhare for the BMC informed the bench that the probe was underway and the civic authorities needed time to submit its findings.After hearing the submissions, the court observed that the video raised “serious concerns” about the management and disposal of bodies of Covid-19 victims and said that it was “widening the scope of the petition to include all government and civic run hospitals in the state”. The bench then directed advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni to place the procedure for management and disposal of bodies of Covid-19 victims and also directed the BMC to submit its report on the viral video by Monday and posted the PIL for hearing for July 3.Satisfied with ambulance services in city,court says while disposing Somaiya’s PILExpressing satisfaction on the measures initiated by the state and civic corporation on the availability of ambulances to ferry Covid-19 as well as non-Covid patients, the bench disposed a PIL filed by BJP leader and former parliamentarian Kirit Somaiya. The court was informed that a round-the-clock helpline was started for accessing ambulance services, and information about ambulances was also being updated on the official website of the civic body. Hence, the concerns raised in the petition were addressed. Somaiya earlier sought directions to the BMC to rope in private ambulance service providers in view of civic ambulances proving to be insufficient. Somaiya submitted that as both all patients had to wait for long hours before a civic ambulance reached them, many died and thus there was a need to rope in the around 3,000 private ambulances in the city to make up for the shortage. The court observed that the concerns of the petitioner were addressed and disposed the PIL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sion-hospital-video-hc-directs-maharashtra-government-to-explain-process-for-disposing-covid-19-patients-bodies/story-djGUjzIaGXjDgxzZfW15qM.html
27-06-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana to set up bulk drug park in Panipat, medical devices hub in Karnal||In line with the Centre’s plan to promote local manufacturing, Haryana has proposed to set up a bulk drug park spread over 1,000 acres in Panipat and a medical devices hub in Karnal. The Panipat park has been proposed to be set up over developed industrial land under the Centre’s scheme for the promotion of production drugs in bulk. The Panipat park would reduce manufacturing cost of bulk medicines in the country and dependency on other countries for them, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said on Friday while addressing an inaugural session of CII’s ‘Pharmascope’ event through a virtual platform here, an official statement said. Speaking as the chief guest in the inaugural session of “CII Pharmascope - a step towards Atmnirbhar Bharat - Made in India, Made for the World”, Khattar said the state also plans to set up a medical devices manufacturing hub, spread over 225 acres in Karnal, just 25 km away from the proposed Panipat park. He said the proximity of Panipat to New Delhi is an added advantage and Panipat being centrally located would be able to supply raw materials for bulk drugs to neighbouring states of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, New Delhi and parts of Uttar Pradesh. Haryana has more than 150 pharmacy colleges, institutions and universities ensuring sufficient availability of skilled manpower to cater to the need of bulk drug park, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-to-set-up-bulk-drug-park-in-panipat-medical-devices-hub-in-karnal/story-Iq32Yi3PZDa12c61C1CqsK.html

The Jhajjar administration also was on high-alert, anticipating an attack by the short-horned grasshoppers, which tend cause widespread crop damage with its voracious feeding behaviour.Narnual sub-divisional officer (agriculture) Harpal said that the locusts entered Mahendergarh through Rambas and Dhancholi villages on Rajasthan border.“The insects have settled on trees and standing crop, mostly cotton and bajra, in two or three villages. In the remaining villages, the insects passed without causing much damage. The insects are now headed towards Kanina but department is monitoring the movement and we will be using tractor-mounted sprayers to kill them,” the official added.The agricultural officials said fresh swarms of locusts came to Rajasthan from Pakistan and the same entered in Mahendergarh villages.“Drone operations are best ways to tackle the locust attack as compared to tractor-mounted sprayers,” the official added.Mahendergarh deputy commissioner RK Singh said that special supervision teams have been formed to tackle the situation.“I appeal to the farmers to inspect their fields and immediately report to the local agricultural development officer if they spot any locust. We have also advised people to make loud noises by beating drums, thalis, sound-producing instruments and tin boxes to drive away the locusts. Patwaris and village secretaries have been directed to visit villages and spread information about the locust attack,” the DC added.He further said that the agricultural officials will attack the locusts in night hours by using pesticides such as chlorpyrifos, deltamethrin, diflubenzuron and cyhalothrin to protect their crops, vegetables and trees.“We have put fire officials on alert to control the situation We will use fire tenders for spraying, if needed. We have formed village-level WhatsApp groups to keep the farmers informed,” the Mahendergarh deputy commissioner added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/swarms-of-locust-reach-mahendergarh-rewari-villages-jhajjar-on-alert/story-IUQCt06APRKok963jxFw7J.html

27-06-2020||Mumbai||66% rise in sea snakes caught in nets along south Konkan in 3 years: Mangrove cell||A two-third increase in the number of sea snakes caught in fishing nets has been recorded along the south Konkan coastline over the last three years, according to the state mangrove cell. Front-fanged and highly-venomous marine reptiles, sea snakes or coral reef snakes are protected under schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.The mangrove cell under the forest department, Mangrove Foundation and Bengaluru-based Dakshin Foundation found that in surveys conducted during 2016 and 2017, 478 sea snakes of three species were caught by trawlers, gill nets and shore seines. There was a 66% rise in 2018 and 2019 when sampling surveys reported the number had increased to 793 of seven different species along Malvan and surrounding areas of Sindhudurg.“Mass bycatch of sea snakes due to commercial overfishing, mostly unknowingly, has resulted in a major threat to the species. With hardly any research available on the impact to overall numbers, we may be losing countless undiscovered species that are unintentionally caught in trawl and gill nets,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest, state mangrove cell.Sea snakes or coral reef snakes are widely distributed in marine habitats such as corals, mangroves, seagrass meadows and shallow waters across the Indian and Pacific oceans. They can be identified based on their flattened, oar-like tail that allows them to move through the water quickly. Their length varies from 20 inches to over six feet. There are about 70 species found across the world with the highest diversity known among marine reptiles. Along Maharashtra, there are nine species while the Sindhudurg coast is home to seven.Researchers indicated the possibility of species decline for the Shaw’s sea snake (Hydrophis curtus) over the past decade. “Based on studies carried out between 2004 and 2009, and latest sampling studies from 2016 to 2019, we can see a clear change in species composition,” said Shawn Dsouza, research assistant, Dakshin Foundation adding that the Shaw’s sea snake had shown a considerable decline in numbers due to unregulated fishing as a major threat. “We found higher mortalities from large trawlers that scrape the ocean floor bycatch as compared to other fishing gear such as gill nets. As compared to the Shaw’s sea snake, the number of Beaked sea snake (Hydrophis schistosus) has rapidly increased as by catch. We may witness a similar trajectory of suspected decline of the species (similar to the Shaw’s sea snake) if regulations are not strengthened,” said Dsouza.The most dominant species along the Mumbai coast is the Little file snake (Acrochordus granulatus), said Dsouza, adding the threat to the species has not been assessed due to lack of research.Member of the Marine Conservation Committee of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Species Survival Commission (SSC) Dr Aaron Savio Lobo said harmful fishing practices are being sustained, and if they continue, these may alter species communities. “Fishers are aware about sea snakes but mechanised operations through low quality bulk fishing such as trawls and gill nets submerged for several hours allow these species to drown. There is a need for better fisheries management combined with focused attention to reduce overfishing,” said Dr Lobo.An alarming rise in overfishing in Maharashtra, particularly of juvenile fish and other protected marine species, led to overall losses exceeding Rs686 crore per year, according to the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute. “As this continues, what we will see is silent decline where species are lost without even discovering them. We have probably already pushed species into local decline and there is no knowledge about it,” said Dr. Lobo.The state fisheries department said they were not aware of the impact on the species but with help from the mangrove cell would commence separate awareness activities for the fishing community. “Guidelines have been proposed to curb overfishing but using this time when there is a fishing ban, we will take help from the mangrove cell to build awareness along the Konkan coast and understand how sea snakes are being affected. Such representations have not been made to us so far,” said Rajendra Jadhav, joint commissioner, state fisheries department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/66-rise-in-sea-snakes-caught-in-nets-along-south-konkan-in-3-years-mangrove-cell/story-sY1OinzB873Oqg32xIVMQJ.html

These projects included the installation of rooftop solar panels on government buildings (Rs 2.6 crore), construction of the building of the Integration Command and Control Centre (ICCC) (Rs 0.35 crore) and the procurement of sewer cleaning machines (Rs 5.94 crore). Chief executive officer (CEO) of the Ludhiana Smart City Limited (LSCL) Sanyam Aggarwal said, “The projects were moving at a slow pace in the initial years as the focus was on preparing detailed project reports, etc. But, now the work on all the projects has been expedited at the ground level.”The major projects included Sarabha Nagar retrofitting and development of the Malhar road as smart road, LED streetlights project, carcass utilisation plant, etc has commenced. Contractors may be given extensions of up to two months due to lockdown, but these projects would be completed this year, the CEO added.“The major focus at present is on the projects, including the construction of a multi-storey parking lot in the Feroze Gandhi market, installation of compactors, upgrading the fire brigade, upgrading of sports infrastructure in the Guru Nanak Stadium and Rakh Bagh,” said Aggarwal.MC superintending engineer Rahul Gagneja said, “The state-level technical committee has also approved the projects, including the installation of static compactors, retrofitting of the Ghumar Mandi market and fencing alongside the Buddha Nullah.”FOCUS SHOULD BE NEGLECTED AREAS: GOEL One of the directors of the LSCL Sanjay Goel said, “The focus of the smart city projects should be on neglected areas of the city, but most of the projects are being taken up in posh areas of the city. The authorities should also work to decongest city roads and facilitate the smooth movement of traffic.”He added, “Efforts should also be made to improve the condition of old city areas. I will take up these issues in the upcoming meeting of the Board of Directors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/smart-city-projects-pick-up-momentum-in-ludhiana/story-WdXHKgaDwOqIrv6pPuTfcO.html
27-06-2020||Mumbai||HC stays GR on schools fees||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday stayed a government resolution issued by the state school education department on May 8, 2020 that restrained schools across the state from hiking fees for the academic year 2020-21 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.A bench of justice Ujjal Bhuyan and justice Riyaz Chagla stayed the GR that also instructed schools to reduce school fees for 2020-21 if the school expenditure is reduced because of not using any facilities. The GR also instructed educational institutions to allow parents to pay balance fees, if any, for 2019-20 and due fees for 2020-21 in quarterly or monthly instalments, and not to charge fees on annual basis.Association of Indian Schools and three educational institutions have challenged the validity of the GR on various grounds.Advocate Saket Mone, The counsel for one of the petitioners, Kasegaon Education Society which runs a school affiliated to the Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) at Kharegaon in Navi Mumbai and several other unaided schools across the country, confirmed that the HC on Friday stayed the GR.The institute contended that the GR was ultra vires not only to the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fees) Act, 2011, but also the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and was issued without any authority in law, as neither of the legislations empowered the state authorities to issue such directions.It added that the GR was in breach of its right to administer the school, and as held by the Supreme Court that right indubitably includes right to regulate and fix fees in accordance with the law, and thus takes away the constitutional right of the petitioner institution guaranteed by Article 19(1)(g).The educational institution has also questioned an order issued by the local education officer who prohibited the petitioner body from asking parents to pay any balance fees for the year 2019-20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-stays-gr-on-schools-fees/story-OBpWI3wwkCcglk6hjTSEhM.html

27-06-2020||Mumbai||Will only test prisoners with comorbidities initially: State to HC||The state government has informed the Bombay high court (HC) that it has planned to provide rapid antigen testing for inmates with comorbid conditions depending on the availability of the test kits. The advocate general submitted that as inmates were relatively safe in the confines of the prison, testing kits would be deployed in high-risk areas on a priority. The state made the submissions in response to a clutch of petitions seeking various reliefs for prison inmates after Covid positive cases emerged across prisons in the state.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice MS Karnik, while hearing through video conferencing PILs filed by People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), an NGO and individuals like politician Geeta Jain, activist and lawyer Archana Rupwate among others, was informed by petitioners that they had prepared a list of suggestions and objections to the draft modified guidelines submitted by the state in the previous hearing.Senior advocate Mihir Desai for PUCL said the state’s assurance in the guidelines that regular thermal screening of inmates would be conducted and only those inmates having fever, breathing problems and other symptoms would be subjected to swab tests was not sufficient and there should be mass testing of inmates. The petitioners also submitted that the lower courts were not abiding by the recommendations of the high-power committee (HPC), as a result of which many applications for interim bail and parole were pending.AG Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, while responding to the suggestion of mass testing inmates, said the state was awaiting rapid antigen testing kits and once the kits were available it would be used for testing inmates and jail staff. He, however, added that as the kits were required on a priority in high-risk zones, it would not be possible to conduct mass testing of inmates, and added that only inmates with comorbidities would undergo the rapid antigen test initially.After hearing the submissions, the court directed the state to update its website on the status of the inmates regularly and also directed senior counsel Milind Sathe, representing the HPC, to issue a circular to all district legal service authorities to assist lower courts to expedite the hearing of interim bail and parole applications and posted the matter for order on Tuesday, June 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/will-test-only-prisoners-with-comorbidities-initially-state-to-hc/story-cyUDPyJhb3AtStmDfjtoHI.html

27-06-2020||Mumbai||‘Rise in cases in suburbs may be due to easing of lockdown’||The increase in Covid-19 cases in north Mumbai could be due to relaxation in lockdown, said Parambir Singh, commissioner of police (CP), Mumbai. He, however, added that civic officials and the police department took multiple effective measures in accordance with the situation, and now they are yielding positive results. Singh on Friday visited many hotspots in the northern suburbs, including Santosh Nagar in Goregaon (East) and Appa Pada in Kandivli (East), which have seen a spike in new cases recently. Speaking to journalists, Singh said a trend of increasing cases in buildings in slum and non-slum areas has been observed and said, “We are sealing those buildings and making them containment areas.” “It is sometimes difficult to control cases in high-density population areas, but by following social distancing norms it can be effectively dealt with. We enforce lockdown in areas where these norms are not being followed,” the top cop said.Currently there are around 750 containment zones in the city, of which 250 to 300 are in the north region. Around a fortnight ago when there was sudden increase in cases, lockdown was re-enforced 27 hotspots in northern suburbs. “Now, the number of cases is going down. If cases keep on dropping, we would allow partial relaxation in lockdown,’ Singh said.While answering a question on the possible reasons that led to the sudden increase in cases, Singh said, “Health officials would be the right people to comment on it. But we believe that when the lockdown was relaxed many people may have not followed social distancing norms, because of which cases have increased. But now everything is in control.”Singh has also asked senior police officers to prepare a list of essential service staffers who commute out of the area for work. “Sometimes these people become potential carriers. Hence they would be identified and after their list is prepared, the CP would speak to the municipal commissioner requesting to arrange accommodation for these staffers near their work places,” said Dilip Sawant, additional commissioner (north region).2,634 cops positive, 1,979 recovered So far 2,634 policemen from the city police force tested positive for Covid-19, of whom 1,979 have recovered completely. OF the recovered personnel, 1,110 have also joined duty. In the Maharashtra Police, which includes Mumbai, more than 4,200 policemen were infected, of whom 3,000 have recovered.500 FIRs by Cyber policeAmid the spread of Covid-19, some anti-social rumours spread through social media are creating an atmosphere of fear among the citizens. As these rumours are leading to social rifts in many places, the cyber police have started cracking down on the people spreading the rumours and they have registered more than 500 cases and arrested 262 people so far. Beed, Pune Rural and Jalgaon districts have seen the maximum cases related to circulation of fake news, objectionable content, etc.Two held for stealing autorickshaws Oshiwara police on Thursday arrested two thieves who stole parked autorickshaws during lockdown and later used those to ferry passengers to earn a living.

27-06-2020||Mumbai||State mobile app offers free non-Covid medical consultation||The Maharashtra government has developed a mobile application, eSanjeevaniOPD, that will provide free online tele-consultation medical services to non-Covid patients in the state. People will have to register on the app using their mobile numbers and then will be able to directly chat with expert doctors through video conferencing or text messages. The app, available on Google Play Store, works as an online OPD service without patients having to physically visit a doctor. The services can be availed between 9.30am and 1.30pm, six days a week, with it being shut on Sundays.Earlier in a joint venture with the help of the Central government, the service was made available through a portal named www.esanjeevaniopd.in. The portal was made fully operational from May 12 after a pilot run. So far, 1,606 patients have used the portal.State health minister Rajesh Tope said the decision to start free OPD services was taken considering the difficulties faced by the people in the absence of services from private practitioners. Patients will be able to upload their medical report or other documents on the mobile application after registering. They will be given a token number and will be notified about the appointment so that they can log in accordingly. Patients will have to wait until a doctor gets free to connect via video conferencing or text message.

The issue arose as many societies restricted the entry of house help during the lockdown and are not ready to allow them despite the easing of curbs by the state government.The department has pointed out that the state government, in its various notifications on Covid-19, had never restricted the movement of house help and drivers. It said it has come to the notice of the state government that some housing societies are framing rules and regulations contrary to those issued by the state. It said the office-bearers need to allow help and drivers as notified by the government and not flout the rules. Registrars monitor the working of the housing society. Members of the housing society can complain to them if they have grievances against the elected members. They also conduct the elections of the housing societies.Office-bearers, however, said the restriction was for the betterment of the residents. “Housing society members are restricting help and drivers to protect the spread of Covid-19,” said Dhaval Shah, chairman, Lokhandwala-Oshiwara Citizens’ Association.The association of house help, however, called it discriminatory. “Our livelihood is at stake and we are as careful as others regarding the virus,” said Babli Rawat, president, Ghar Kamgar Molkarin Sanghatana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/societies-can-t-bar-entry-of-house-help-and-drivers/story-wrZbfBWPL9OV5OGTloVy4H.html

27-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab school students in a quandary over common entrance exam date||The students who have been preparing for the common entrance test (CET) to get admission in meritorious schools across the state are in a dilemma as the Society for Promotion of Quality Education for Poor and Meritorious Students of Punjab has not announced the date for the exam yet.Earlier, the CET was scheduled to be held on April 16 but it was postponed due to the Covid-19 outbreak.A total of 19,000 students have got themselves registered online for the entrance exam, the date for which has been extended five times till now.With uncertainty regarding the exam date, the students are worried and concerned about how to take forward their preparation for the exam that used to be held in the first week of May till last year.Avani Sharma, a former student of Government Model Senior Secondary School, Cemetery Road, said, “I feel frustrated as the authorities have not yet given any clarity regarding the entrance exam date. I am also staying in constant touch with my teachers to inquire about the CET date. There is no information regarding it on the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan website as well.”“I scored 84% marks in Class 10 pre-board exams and was promoted to the next class. I have been preparing for the entrance exam since the lockdown was imposed,” she added.Manvi Dholan, a student of Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Jagraon, said, “I registered online for the exam last month and was very excited to take admission in a meritorious school as such schools provide free of cost professional coaching to medical, non-medical and commerce students.”“But now I feel I will have to continue with my studies online therefore I took admission in Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Jagraon, last week. With the rising number of Covid cases, all boards have cancelled the board exams so I’m worried that the test might get cancelled as well.”All ten meritorious schools in the state had been turned into quarantine centres last month. Patients with mild symptoms are being treated there. Inderpal Singh Malhotra, assistant project director, Punjab Meritorious Schools, said, “We are planning to conduct the entrance exam in July and will finalise the date soon. The online classes can be started in August. In total, 19,000 students have registered online for Class 11 admissions.”On being asked how the exam would be conducted next month with the number of Covid cases on the rise, he said, “We cannot admit the students in Class 11 in meritorious schools without an entrance exam. It will not be easy to conduct the exam for 19,000 students but we are considering several ways and might increase the number of exam centers. We have to follow the social distancing norms while conducting the exam.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-school-students-in-a-quandary-over-common-entrance-exam-date/story-u7QVfXRF5Yqs8qdv0BnQSM.html
27-06-2020||City||City bus service remains off road in Ludhiana, residents at receiving end||While the municipal corporation (MC) allowed the contractor to operate the local bus service in the city a week ago, the service remains off the road as the contractor is seeking a hike in fares.In the absence of the service, residents continue to bear the brunt, especially amid the hike in fuel prices.When put to a halt after the imposition of curfew in the state in March, the city bus service used to ferry around 3,500 passengers daily on four routes in the city. The routes included Sahnewal to Clock Tower, Kohara to the bus stand, Dugri to Metro Supermarket and Railway Station to Meharban.An official of the MC, requesting anonymity, said, “The contractor has been seeking a hike in the fare for a long time, but the authorities are demanding that the contractor should first clear the dues. A case regarding the same is also sub judice in the Punjab and Haryana high court.”He said the contractor is claiming that rates of diesel have increased by Rs 26 per litre during the past five years, but the fare has not been increased.He said the contractor has also claimed that he will have to run the buses at half the capacity as per the Covid-10 guidelines issued by the government.MC additional commissioner Sanyam Aggarwal said, “The MC permitted the contractor to commence the service last week. Now, it depends on the contractor when he resumes it. There is no proposal to increase the fare as of now and if the contractor fails to run the buses, then action would be taken against him.”Contractor Jaskirat Singh from Horizon Connect Transways Private Limited said, “We are expecting low footfall as the labour has moved back to their home towns. Also, fuel prices are rising. Meanwhile, we are conducting a survey to judge the feasibility of resuming the service.”The residents, however, demanded resumption of the service at the earliest.A resident of Jawahar Nagar camp, Jaswinder Singh, said, “I always used to travel in the city bus, but now I am forced to travel in the auto rickshaws, where chances of spread of coronavirus are higher and we also have to shell out more money. The MC should operate the buses on its own, if there is issues with the contractor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/city-bus-service-remains-off-road-in-ludhiana-residents-at-receiving-end/story-w8ct6GtUGgAtTRGGfGPpUN.html
27-06-2020||Mumbai||How Dharavi flattened the curve, and showed Mumbai the way||On May 8, Dharavi-based labour contractor and community volunteer Avirath Shinde, 36, was carrying a large package of food to distribute to families in India’s worst-affected Covid-19 slum cluster. He was in a hurry that day, and on the unevenly paved inner lanes of Dharavi, Shinde slipped and fell, breaking his hand. He walked to the nearest private hospital to get his bones fixed, and it was here that he began to complain of fever. The doctors immediately tested him for Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. When the reports came in later that day, Shinde was found to be positive.Dharavi is India’s largest slum, with over 8.5 lakh people living in around 55,000 dwelling units spread across approximately 2.5 sqkm. The population density here is 3.4 lakh per sqkm, more than 10 times the average population density of Mumbai (32,303 per sqkm) according to a July 2019 United Nations Population Review. On average, in Dharavi, around 10 people live in every housing unit that averages 100 sqft in size.Shinde’s household is no different. There are at least 14 people in his joint-family house that measures approximately 1,200 sqft, a large unit by Dharavi standards. As soon as Shinde tested positive, his family was classified as ‘high-risk contacts’, and every member was tested the same day. Between May 11 and May 12, Shinde’s wife, his 56-year-old mother and his 88-year-old grandmother also tested positive.The Shinde family was one of scores from Dharavi that tested positive in April and May, the months when Covid-19 peaked in this region, making it one of the country’s worst-affected Covid hotspots, along with Worli Koliwada in Mumbai’s G-South ward. In May, Dharavi reported an average of 48 cases per day, with May 3 recording 94 cases, its highest single-day spike. In April, while the average was 18 cases per day, the second half of the month saw intermittent spikes. For instance, on April 28, Dharavi reported 42 cases, and on April 20, 30 cases. But in June, Dharavi seems to have turned the corner; cases are rising only by 18 per day. In fact, on June 23, it recorded only five cases, the lowest since April 5, prompting the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to shutter two Covid care centres (CCC), a Covid facility at the Rajiv Gandhi Sports Complex, and a quarantine centre at a local municipal school.Noted epidemiologist and the state’s Covid-19 surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate, said, “Dharavi’s cases plateaued in early June, and the curve has now flattened. We are seeing signs of further reduction, and soon the curve will begin to dip. The challenge is to maintain this momentum.”The dip in cases led to recognition by the Union ministry of health and family welfare. On June 21, it issued a release touting the Dharavi model.Dharavi’s current daily growth rate is just 0.47%, compared to the May average of 4.3%. While 34 new cases were recorded on June 1 (the month’s highest number), June 2 saw 25 cases. The downward trend continued with 19 cases on June 3, 23 on June 4; 17 on June 5; 10 on June 6; 13 on June 7; 12 on June 8; 26 on June 9; and 11 on June 10. Since then, the highest number was reported on June 12 (29, with two deaths). On June 24, Dharavi saw only 10 cases, while eight cases were recorded on June 26.Overall, Dharavi – which is part of the 9.07 sq km G-North ward – has recorded 2,218 Covid-19 cases and 81 deaths as of June 26. The same day, Mumbai had a total of 72,175 cases and 4,179 deaths. While it was one of the country’s worst hotspots in April and May, Dharavi’s doubling rate on Friday rose to 140 days, compared to Mumbai’s average of 41 days (June 24) and the national average of 19.1 days (June 26, source: covid19india.org). “It seems (that Dharavi has flattened its curve). Even in my hospital, there used to be a waiting list of patients, but for the last four or five days we have some vacant beds. ICU beds are still full, so the critical patients are still recovering, but overall it seems that cases per day are decreasing,” said Dr Behram Pardiwala, head, department of medicine, Wockhardt Hospital.It was not easy achieving this plateau, though. Kiran Dighavkar, BMC assistant commissioner and the G-North ward officer said Dharavi’s population density was the biggest challenge “right from the beginning”. Four-fifths of its population still relies on the 450 community toilets, and an average dwelling unit is not more than 250 sqft big with at least 10 persons living in each. “Social distancing is impossible here,” said Dighavkar.The Dharavi model, therefore, had to be different, and more aggressive. The BMC used what it called the ‘4Ts’ approach – Tracing, Tracking, Testing, and Treating. According to Dighavkar, strict containment measures have been in place since the beginning, and BMC even delivered cooked food, or grocery packets to residents to ensure they do not need to break containment zone rules for essentials. “We proactively screened residents through fever camps, and that helped us identify those with Covid-19 risk from the community randomly. With early detection, the suspected cases and high-risk contacts of Covid-19 patients were identified and placed at quarantine centres,” said Dighavkar. “Over 90% of Dharavi’s cases were treated within Dharavi, and only critical patients were moved out for treatment.”While the government and civic institutions such as sports complexes and schools were converted into isolation and treatment centres, BMC acquired three private hospitals in Dharavi, in addition to erecting 22 Covid care centres with 4,447 beds and four dedicated Covid health centres with 266 beds. BMC staffers and volunteers even organised laughter therapy and music sessions at these centres to keep up the spirits of Covid-19 patients.The tracing and tracking programme included a massive door-to-door screening exercise using mobile dispensaries, which was run by hundreds of BMC staffers and healthcare volunteers. While mobile dispensaries screened 14,970 people in Dharavi, over 3.6 lakh people were screened by private doctors working with BMC, and municipal staff in door-to-door visits to 47,500 homes. Senior citizens and comorbid patients, considered as vulnerable groups for Covid-19 were screened for oxygen concentration in the body, and simultaneously treated. A Union health and family welfare ministry statement issued on June 21 said that “8,246 senior citizens were surveyed and as part of its policy of ‘Timely Separation’, they were separated from the other community to effectively limit the transmission of the disease”. In addition, over 25,000 grocery packets and 21,000 food packets have been distributed in Dharavi so that people stay indoors and do not leave the containment zones.This programme was so successful that BMC Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal announced on June 22 that it will be replicated across Mumbai’s western and central suburbs as part of BMC’s Mission Zero project. Across the city, 879 municipal dispensaries are operational and 5.8 lakh people have been screened so far.In Dharavi, the Shinde household was among the hundreds that were isolated. “We did not interact with anyone and were locked up in our house at all times for 14 days,” said Avirath Shinde, who had tested positive in May.“We had home quarantine stamps on our hand. All food, including vegetables and milk, were brought to us by volunteers or BMC staff. Because my grandmother is old and had cough in her chest after she tested positive, the kind of hospital bed needed for her was not easily available. We had to look for an entire day for a bed, moreover, I was already quarantined and could not contribute to the hunt.” Shinde beat the virus in May itself, and is back to being a food distribution volunteer.Despite the victory, the challenges of maintaining the downward curve remain, as Dharavi’s economy largely depends on small enterprises run from single rooms or homes within the slum. As businesses open as part of the state government’s Mission Begin Again, migrant labourers who had returned to their hometowns are gradually returning, and physical distancing may once again pose a huge challenge, say activists and healthcare professionals.“Migrant workers left Dharavi throughout the lockdown months. But they will all eventually return and we will kickstart the local economy,” said Dighavkar. “We will then continue with tight containment measures to ensure cases are in check.”Dharavi has over 15,000 single-room factories, and over 5,000 GST-registered enterprises. During the lockdown, according to BMC estimates, over 1.45 lakh workers left Dharavi to go to their hometowns. Dr Awate said, “Such infections [Covid-19] are known to bounce back. The future trend in cases will depend on the quality of interventions and their efficacy. Strong containment measures have proved successful in Dharavi, so we will have to maintain them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/how-dharavi-flattened-the-curve-and-showed-mumbai-the-way/story-iK8dGivPh69bZ3xJbHih6I.html

Representatives of various industry associations also accompanied the delegation. They said that the package for the industry should also include a clause under which the state government should take on the responsibility of paying salaries of industrial workers for the lockdown period.Dhillon, who led the delegation, said financial packages for small and medium scale industries and traders had already been approved by other state governments, including Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. The delegation also demanded waiver of fixed charges till March 31, 2021 and asked the government to provide electricity at Rs 5 per unit and early disbursal of VAT refunds of nearly Rs 80 crore. Besides they also demanded waiver of property tax and free train service for labourers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-demands-financial-package-to-bail-out-ludhiana-industry/story-cwPhJ337uinU448f3uaIHK.html
27-06-2020||Mumbai||Dal, rice, veg and rotis: Andheri gurudwara delivers free daily meals||Working two shifts daily, the one thing Susheel Singh waits for is the food that is delivered to him twice a day. Since the lockdown, Singh, a watchman at a society in Seven Bungalows, and others working in societies in and around the area, receive meals from the local gurudwara. Volunteers drive around distributing rotis, dal, and rice to whoever is hungry.“Food is prepared since 5am and volunteers work in shifts to help in packaging and delivery. Tea is served at the gate of our gurudwara twice a day. Everyone is invited to take food,” said Devinder Singh Kochhar, president of Gurudwara Sachkhand Darbar.The gurudwara was known for its langar (kitchen) that feeds 2,000 people on average, even before the lockdown was implemented. Since March 22, the management started cooking and serving meals to anyone in need of food twice a day.The gurudwara currently manages to produce over 7,500 rotis and 150kg of rice and dal for every meal. In the evening, another 300kg of vegetables are cooked and served.Recently, the management also started delivering meals to residents stuck at home, either due to their age or health concerns.“Several people who live alone and are old do not step out of the house to buy groceries for fear of contracting the virus. Some people have lost their jobs and can’t afford food anymore. Earlier this month, we decided to start delivering meals to such people at their doorsteps twice a day to ensure no one goes hungry,” said Kochhar.However, they faced a couple of challenges along the way. Volunteers said they faced difficulty travelling to and from the gurudwara, and there were constant orders by the police to stop gathering to cook food.“For some time, we ended up cooking food in another area and then delivering it. Even when we had to shut the gurudwara gate, volunteers who stayed back managed to cook as much as possible,” said a volunteer.As the need for food kept increasing, so did donations. “Oer the past few weeks, local hoteliers have also helped us by sending their staff to cook more food. All this work is possible only because our donors and volunteers never give up, and our management is always on our side,” said Kochhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dal-rice-veg-and-rotis-andheri-gurudwara-delivers-free-daily-meals/story-gr7Y6tf1Y8SG3wGxYQ31YO.html

The victim, Manmeet Kaur, 28, was on her way to a local shrine with her sister-in-law around 6am, when her husband, Amarbir Singh of Shimlapuri, attacked her on the head, face, neck and back.He then also hurt himself with the weapon, but onlookers managed to snatch it from his hand, before he made good his escape.Kaur was rushed to Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, where her condition is stated to be serious.The Shimlapuri police arrested the accused after a few hours.He was booked for attempt to murder under the Indian Penal Code.Inspector Amandeep Singh Brar, SHO, Shimlapuri police station, said Amarbir often used to thrash his wife in an inebriated condition, and also suspected her having an extramarital relationship. Due to this, Manmeet and her five-year-old son were living with her parents for the past one year. He was aware that she used to visit the local gurdwara with her sister-in-law, and attacked her on Friday morning, the SHO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/32-year-old-carpenter-tries-to-murder-wife-arrested/story-K3V0ZYxukkGQHowdEd1E5I.html
27-06-2020||Mumbai||Report pending deaths: BMC’s final warning to all hospitals||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Friday issued a final warning to all municipal and private hospitals to report pending Covid-19 deaths to the civic body before 5pm on June 29, or face action. This is the second such warning issued to hospitals, after the Maharashtra government added 862 Covid-19 deaths to Mumbai’s cumulative toll on June 16, after reconciling figures that were received late from hospitals. The first such warning was issued on June 18.The latest order was given by municipal commissioner IS Chahal during a meeting with superintendents of major hospitals and municipal doctors on Friday. During the discussion, it was reported that in some cases, private hospitals did not inform BMC about deaths within 48 hours. Despite repeated opportunities, if hospitals fail to report deaths within 48 hours henceforth, strict action will be taken, Chahal said during the video conference. The civic body had also announced that reconciling figures of Covid-19 deaths would be a recurring process over the next month until all data was cleaned up.Chahal had told Hindustan Times last week that BMC would not take any action against hospitals for reporting Covid-19 deaths late. Subsequently, an official clarification issued by BMC attributed the delay to shortage of staff and limitations in means of communication. BMC had also clarified that while the 862 deaths had occurred in March and April, 750 of them were reported to BMC on June 12.On June 8, BMC made it mandatory for all hospitals to report Covid deaths within 48 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/report-pending-deaths-bmc-s-final-warning-to-all-hospitals/story-QNkecJSkprtbMPRcPZ6SlJ.html
27-06-2020||Mumbai||Allow teachers to work from home if possible: Education department to schools||After several schools in red zones demanded clarity on the state education department’s standard operating procedure (SOP) for reopening their institutes, the department released specific guidelines on Friday evening.As per the guidelines, all schools in Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, and Palghar should allow teachers to continue working from home until schools reopen physically.“Travelling is a big issue in these places as public transport is still not fully functional. However, in case the principal deems fit, teachers can be called in twice a week for the development of e-learning content or in preparation for the physical reopening of schools,” the guidelines state.Women teachers, those with comorbidities like diabetes, respiratory issues, and blood pressure problems, and those above the age of 55 years are exempt from physically attending school.“Care should be taken to ensure that teachers who are called to school are not all called at the same time to avoid crowding,” the guidelines state.For schools that have been used by respective civic bodies or the state government as quarantine centres, teachers cannot be asked to report to work until the buildings are handed back to the principals. Teachers who are involved in Covid-19 related duties have to be relieved from the frontline work so that they can contribute towards online learning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/allow-teachers-to-work-from-home-if-possible-education-department-to-schools/story-mQgisADgi86sDggG6rqKqO.html
27-06-2020||Delhi||Schools to remain shut in Delhi till July 31, online classes and remote learning will continue||All schools in the national capital, both public and private, will remain closed till July 31, the Delhi government said on Friday, while announcing that online classes for students will continue.Schools in Delhi have been shut since March 19 in the wake of the coronavirus disease outbreak, though they have switched to online learning by conducting classes via video conferencing and sharing study materials on WhatsApp groups.On Friday, education department officials presented before Manish Sisodia, deputy chief minister and education minister, district-wise reports prepared based on the suggestions of school authorities, students and parents. The decision to extend the closure of schools was announced after the meeting. The Delhi government has been holding consultations with principals of private and public schools along with teachers and parents on how to resume operations in schools after the summer vacation ends on June 30. Classes usually begin on July 1 after summer break.Friday’s meeting was aimed at designing an action plan for schools so as to ensure that they are well-prepared whenever they reopen, according to government officials.After the meeting, a statement by the government said suggestions were given by teachers, parents and students in order to provide “learning opportunities and emotional support to children using remote methods and support of parents till the schools reopen”. “Continuing with the online classes wherever possible, carrying proper sanitization work in classrooms, distributing masks to students, thermal screening of every student at the school entrance gate, and reduction of the syllabus were some of the major suggestions given at the meeting,” the statement said, referring to the reopening plans.The recommendations to the government also said primary classes should be held once or twice a week with just 12-15 students in a class. While students from classes 3 to 5 could attend school on alternate days, those between classes 6 and 8 may be present once or twice a week, according to the suggestions. For students in 9th and 10th standards, classes should be taken in very small groups once or twice a week along with online classes, it was discussed.“It was suggested during the meeting that class 11 and 12 should be conducted on alternate days and online classes should be carried (out) on remaining days. There was also a suggestion of reducing their syllabus. Some also suggested that only 3 to 4 hours of classes should be carried per day,” the government statement said.According to officials from the directorate of education, Sisodia said in the meeting: “In light of all the suggestions, we should make a plan to reopen schools in a way that would teach students to live with the coronavirus and prepare them for a new role in new circumstances.”Sarita Batra, principal of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Shalimar Bagh, said, “We will continue with the online classes. We have tied up with Microsoft Teams for a safer online learning experience and have created student IDs on it. There have been workshops with teachers on learning pedagogies...Since teachers were already coming to schools to manage the hunger relief centres, it gave us an opportunity to meet and engage in micro-planning.” Government schools have been acting as hunger relief centres since the lockdown began, providing meals to needy. Teachers come to these centres to help with the managerial work.SK Bhattacharya, the president of an action committee for unaided recognised private schools, said: “As far as private schools are concerned, we will be opening schools as per the Delhi government guidelines. Most of us have resumed or will be resuming online classes from July 1 to ensure learning continuity among children.”In the three-phase unlock plan of the central government, reopening educational institutes including schools and colleges is in the second phase. While detailing the outlines of the plan in May-end, the Centre said a decision on this was likely in July. In the first phase, places of worship, dine-in restaurants and shopping malls have reopened earlier this month in several parts of India, where a hard lockdown was imposed on March 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/schools-to-remain-shut-in-delhi-till-july-31-online-classes-and-remote-learning-will-continue/story-mmH8IbR2w8kQjpVoIh4hcP.html
27-06-2020||Mumbai||MMR’s case positivity is high, the situation is grim, says Fadnavis||Highlighting the high Covid-19 case positivity rate in the city and its metropolitan region, former chief minister and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Friday wrote another letter to chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray, cautioning him of the grim situation on hand.Fadnavis pointed out that the case positivity rate in Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) as on June 24, was in the range of 20.46% (Palghar, Vasai-Virar) to 48.55% (Bhiwandi-Nizampur) as against the national average of 6.43% to 7.86%.Case positivity rate refers to the number of positive Covid-19 cases against the number of tests carried out.“The situation in Mumbai and MMR is getting to be extremely grim. Panvel has a case positivity rate of 45%, Bhiwandi’s is 48%, and Mira Bhayander’s 43%. In Mumbai as of June 24, 2,99,369 tests had been done and there were 69,528 [Covid-positive] patients, with a case positivity rate of 23.22%,” said Fadnavis.The Shiv Sena, however, refuted Fadnavis’s allegations as “irresponsible”. Pointing to figures released on Friday, Sena MP and party spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi said that the city’s case positivity rate was 17.52%, and the recovery rate across Maharashtra was 52.25%.Fadnavis also alleged that the government and Mumbai civic body had been deliberately testing less to ensure the city’s daily figures did not show an unwieldy spike in cases.“From May 12, the tests have been kept under 10,000. There was some attempt to increase the tests, but whenever there is a hike in positive cases, the number of tests is brought down,” he added.Rebutting Fadnavis’s allegations, Chaturvedi said, “Mr Fadnavis continues to be irresponsible in his comments and checking facts on ground. Maharashtra government is being applauded by the Ministry of Health for the strategy to contain Covid-19. Does he disagree with his own government at the Centre?

27-06-2020||Chandigarh||Reader’s Take: ‘Private schools should make spends public’||Disclosing accounts should be mandatoryThere appears to be no plausible reason for schools not to withhold this piece of information from those who are spending a major chunk of their earnings on their wards’ education. It should be made mandatory for the school management to share the requisite information so that nothing remains under wraps.Ramesh K Dhiman, ChandigarhNo fee structure prescribedI don’t think putting a balance sheet online will serve any purpose because there is no fee structure prescribed by the administration for these schools, which are definitely making profits. If the administration is so concerned, it can pass an administrative order regarding payment of fee during lockdown.Prof Dr Arun BhardwajSchools not getting land for freeThe contention of the administration that since the schools are built on government land they are bound to follow its directions is unfair. The administration allots government land on concessional rates and not free as given to Central government organisations, hospitals, temples and gurdwaras etc. Secondly, uploading of the accounts amounts to breach of privacy. Why should it be open to everyone to see? School accounts must have been audited. If the administration is still not satisfied let a high power committee of learned luminaries, chartered accountants of repute, academics and judges be appointed to investigate every two years. Perhaps this may bring in the cherished transparency and accountability. Teachers, the backbone of the schools should be respected and not used as consumable articles.Dr Gurdev Singh, MohaliSchools are not profit-making entitiesI am of the considered view that schools must put their balance sheets online to curb the practice of making this noble cause a profit-making business. Of course school owners have to make money to meet expenses, but this trend has put private education out of reach of most Indians. Uploading balance sheets online will help the government evaluate the fee structure and make norms more rational.HL GuptaParents need information on school expenditureWhat’s the problem with putting balance sheets in public domain? Private players are running schools as a corporate entity for business purpose to make profits. Parents who are paying fees and other hidden charges have every right to information on the income and expenditure of the school to justify the high fees. As a private school education is a full-fledged business, it is mandatory to file the balance sheet as per company law so that public interests are not exploited. Many schools have been getting grants from the government but do not maintain records and also charge a high fee from parents. Anil VinayakPrivate schools will start compromising on qualityAsking schools to make their expenditure public is not the right step as private schools are running for profit to provide quality education and better facilities. But once the administration starts checking balance sheets and day-to-day expenses of the school they will start compromising with the quality of study of the child on the one side and on the another side start reducing expenses on the grooming and safety of the children. People in the high income category, such as bureaucrats and businesspersons, send their children to private schools. If they think the fee is high then they should put their children in government schools which the bureaucrats run anyway. Yes, maybe the private schools can waive off some fees which they have not spent during the Covid-19 lockdown. Otherwise, fee should be deposited by parents. Avinash GoyalSchool passing on expenses to parentsMost schools work for profit, and some do not even follow Central Board of Secondary Education guidelines strictly. Some schools pack 45 to 50 students, putting a burden on parents. Many such schools have an annual income of about ₹8 crore to 12 crore. One finds it difficult to understand how they claims they don’t have money payment to release the salary of their teachers and non teaching staff. They want to pay back their schools’ loan by passing on the burden to parents who are suffering during the Covid-19 pandemicKK Bijoy, Chandigarh No hidden agenda, please There should not be any hidden agenda while publishing a school’s balance sheet in the public domain by private institutions as it is evident that they are making good profits. Acres of land have also been provided to the private institutions at subsidised rates by the administration since long . Sreenivasan APSchools should be asked to keep reserve fundsParents believe schools should tap their reserves to pay teachers ,while they are exempted from paying fees.Every school must by law have some reserve funds.These should be put to use judiciously to constantly upgrade and improve educational facilities,which is the school’s prime purpose. Not paying fees and draining the schools of their reserves will, in the end,impact the quality of education being provided to our children.Nina MimaniParents have a right to know about school expensesThe Covid-19 outbreak and lockdown has made it difficult for some of us parents to keep paying the high fee charged by parents. Our children are not using the school buildings, electricity,water, library and computers. Why are we being asked to pay the full fee? All we are asking is that we should pay the basic costs to run the school, but the authorities ave merged all the fee heads into tuition fee. Their plea is that they don’t have funds to pay the salaries of watchmen and gardeners. So we have every right to see the balance sheets to find out whether they have enough to pay their staff. Mamta DuvediAre local education authorities helping private schools?Many school managements are holding back teacher’s salaries on the grounds that they do not have money to pay them. However, they seem to have enough money to contest court cases, or hire lawyers. All the public limited companies submit their balance sheets to the statutory authorities and make them public, as per laid down rules. The private limited or registered companies are submitting their audited reports to the Registrar of Companies in their respective states. Private individuals, small shopkeepers, even vendors have to file their income tax returns with their profit and loss statement. So it is really ridiculous, that privately managed and aided schools, which have been built on the land allocated under concessional rates or otherwise, dealing with a large section of public and governed under the rules and regulations of local or state education board, want exemption from putting their balance sheets on their websites. The local education authorities seem to be either in favour of school managements, as their wards are admitted to prime institutes or they are too stupid t realise that the schools are taking advantage of the situation. Suresh VermaGovt should step in to help studentsThese days many people have lost their jobs and are unable to pay their children’s fees. Therefore, the government should take responsibility for all those children so that they can continue their studies. To do this, it is important for the schools to give an accurate idea of children’s school fees. So the government should make it mandatory for schools to upload their accounts on their websites.Priyam Aggarwal, Chandigarh.Uniformity in facilities and fee structureThere should be uniformity in facilities provided by the private schools to students as they charge extra fee under the heads of filtered water, air conditioners, food, language classes or co-curricular activities. The government should regulate private school fees too with a uniform structure across the countries. Similar facilities should be provided in all the private schools and the same fee structure maintained. A tuition fee ceiling and other expenses for annual day and sports day should also be fixed. Uniform salaries should also be paid to teachers. Stress should be laid on quality of education.Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliPublic has every right to scan accountsThe fact that schools are business entities run with fees paid by parents who are deemed financiers, proves beyond doubt that these are funded by the public that earns every right to scan the balance sheets.Land for schools is earmarked at reduced rates by public authorities.Reluctance of school managements to put accounts in public domain gives rise to suspicions. Why should schools not favour transparency and fair play? Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaDoes every independent body upload account details?Private schools form an integral part of the society’s education system.Having been granted the right to decide their system of working, why should they be expected to upload their balance sheets? Are they not filing their income tax or is it that every independent body uploads its balance sheet on its website? Why are they not trusted for finances if they can be trusted for the creation of an impeccable future for our coming generations? I don’t think any government school or institution uploads its balance sheetsAarti SoodSchools not answerable to allBalance sheets have been uploaded for the kind perusal of the Central Board of Secondary Education, the administration and the DEO .What is disturbing is that somehow everyone has, all of a sudden,taken the responsibility of questioning the schools. Schools are not answerable to everyone.It is a humble request that people mind their own business and let the authorities concerned do the needful .Arti MalhotraGive special concessions to schoolsThe present situation is extraordinary; the lockdown in the wake of Covid-19 has disrupted life. The administration must give some special concessions to the schools as they are expected to cover the deficit both academically and financially.Usha Verma, ChandigarhStop commercialisation of education Putting information in the public domain will provide clarity on the deployment of funds . It will lead to orderly growth of education and prevent its commercialisation. One would like to see such models in all educational institutes in the country, but states need to come on board too . The move is also aimed at finding out whether schools are genuinely out of budget to pay salaries of staff as claimed by them when asked to not charge fee from parents during the lockdown. CPA had even written to the education department to ask schools for their balance sheets to see if they were are actually out of money to pay the staff as they had been pleading. Some schools that uploaded their balance sheets showed surplus money in their accounts. The Chandigarh education department should start issuing show-cause notices to the schools who are not putting their balance sheets online.Vijay Malia, Chandigarh.Fee waiver mustBalance sheets uploaded on websites will show whether schools are earning profits or are non-profits. This is an emergency and every parent is suffering due to the economic crises resulting from the lockdown. These schools must give fee waiver to parents: Take tuition fees but waive development fee, annual charges, transport fee or computer fee.Samasya Samadhaan Team, ChandigarhTransparency, honesty, expected Schools have been entrusted the task to educate, teach discipline, honesty and morality to students. How can they exempt themselves from those principles and duties? Its an open secret that many of the private schools make exorbitant profits from their fee, which is hiked every year. Many private brands are being run by influential individuals, industrialists, politicians and corporate giants. Some function more like professional business entities and academic mafia with the sole motive to earn money through unethical tactics and profiteering agenda. Parents are forced to buy books sets, uniforms and even stationery from schools or the shop selectively designated by them. How can they resist transparency and accountability when many of them has been provided land by the government at highly subsidised rates? Despite making profits they are making a hue and cry while giving salaries to teachers and staff during the Covid-9 crisis. Many have been accused of harassing parents of wards for fees despite clear directions from government in these testing times. An educational institute is said to be a temple of knowledge with primary aim to teach students and build a better society. There is nothing unethical or illegitimate in sharing account details as schools are also an integral part of the society and have to be responsible to the nation.Dr Karan Singh VinayakStrict RTE enforcement requiredThe political class is not doing its bit to enforce the Right to Education laws and ensure quality education for children of this city. The directorate of school education in Chandigarh should release a toll-free number or a helpline to register complaints against schools violating the RTE Act. These helplines should keep the callers’ identity under wraps, else their wards will become soft targets for these “education-oriented businesses”. It needs to be noted that over a 100 public schools were under scanner of the DEO for violations of the RTE Act in Chandigarh for various offences last year. A few more are likely to be joining the queue. The education department needs to wake up and take cognisance of institutions making education a ‘profit centre’ like a grocery shop.Rajiv Boolchand Jain, ZirakpurCancel registrationsIt should be strictly / mandatory for the all private schools to upload their balance sheets on their websites and on their school notice board too ever year. Schools that do not comply should have their registrations cancelledHarpreet Singh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/reader-s-take-private-schools-should-make-spends-public/story-K7LuBgXg5uKnqG0HugQggO.html
27-06-2020||Gurugram||Aravalli Retreat residents oppose derecognition of farmhouses||Residents of the Ansal Aravalli Retreat Welfare Association (AARWA), at a press conference in the city on Friday, voiced their opposition to a recent order by the district administration, derecognising farmhouses built on Aravalli land in Gururgam. Following instructions laid down by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the deputy commissioner, on June 11, had ordered that the land use category of ‘gair mumkin farmhouse’ be struck from revenue records and replaced with ‘gair mumkin pahad’ — the original nomenclature. This move, according to residents and landowners from Aravalli Retreat — a 1,200 acre complex consisting off 670 farmhouses in Raisina village — sets the precedent for demolition of their properties. Gagandeep Singh, a resident and AARRWA member, said, “Until just a week ago, our land was recognised as ‘farmhouse’, and not ‘pahad’. By reversing this decision, the administration has put us in a position where we could lose what we have built here.” ‘Gair mumkin pahad’, as a land-use category, is protected under the ministry of environment, forest and climate change’s (MoEFCC) Aravalli Notification of May 7, 1992, which prohibits any non-forest activities in the Aravallis. On June 6, 2020, the Municipal Corporation of Sohna served show-cause notices to over 400 farmhouses in Aravalli Retreat, on grounds that they had been constructed in violation of the MoEFCC’s notification. Sharad Mohan, another resident of Aravalli Retreat and a member of the AARRWA, said, “The deputy commissioner’s instructions, and the show-cause notices are misinformed. They are based on the NGT’s instructions that all structures built on gair mumkin pahad land after May 7, 1992, are illegal. However, before the MoEFCC’s Aravalli Notification could come into force, Aravalli Retreat had already ceased to be gair mumkin pahad.” Experts and environmentalists explained that the ‘gair mumkin farmhouse’ category was introduced in revenue records around 1991, and has been used, over the years, by private developers to circumvent the MoEFCC’s Aravalli Notification. “There is no such term in revenue records historically. It’s sudden emergence around 1991, just before the Aravalli Notification was to come into force, raises questions as to who allowed these changes to be introduced in the record books, and why,” said Sarvadaman Oberoi, a city-based legal activist.The validity of ‘gair mumkin farmhouse’ as a revenue term has been previously struck down by the Punjab and Haryana High Court. In a 2014 judgment, the court observed, “Concededly, the developers have got changed the kind of land from Gairmumkin Mountain (Pahad) to Gairmumkin Farmhouses. If any Patwari without any legal authority had made the stray entries... then such stray and illegal entries are non est, void and are not sufficient to hold that the land in litigation was Gairmumkin Farm houses (sic).” The court also said that these lands will continue to be recognised as ‘pahad’, and not as ‘farmhouse’. Arvinder Brara, an AARRWA member, contested that the administration’s order was in contempt of court. “This matter has also been fought in the Faridabad environment and sessions courts, in different instances. There are two orders, one from 2013 and another from 2017, which state that the Aravalli Retreat project does not violate the Aravalli Notification of 1992.” In a letter to Amit Khatri on June 24, Brara wrote, “We request you to withdraw your order... as it is in contempt of the orders of the Hon’ble Faridabad Environment and Sessions Court.”However, in October 2018, in the case of Soniya Ghosh v/s State of Haryana, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ruled that, “Any construction raised on the forest area or the area otherwise covered by the Notification dated 07.05.1992 without permission of the competent authority (after the date of the said Notification) has to be treated as illegal and such forest land has to be restored (sic).” According to activist Sarvadaman Oberoi, “The NGT’s ruling naturally overrides that of any other lower courts, so the deputy commissioner’s instructions are not in violation. On the contrary, it obeys the instructions of the highest environmental court in India.” Representatives of Ansal Developers were not present at Friday’s press conference and did not respond to requests for comment through the day. Neither did the deputy commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/aravalli-retreat-residents-oppose-derecognition-of-farmhouses/story-6g3MU0vUTzmRBTWK6zbcqK.html
27-06-2020||Mumbai||Tiger Memon’s brother, 1993 blasts convict, dies in prison||Yusuf Memon, a 1993 serial bomb blasts convict, suffered a heart attack and died in Nashik Central Jail on Friday morning. The 53-year-old was the younger brother of fugitive Ibrahim Mushtaq Abdul Razzaq Memon, alias Tiger Memon, one of the masterminds of the blasts that killed 257 people and injured more than 1,000 others when bombs went off at 12 locations across Mumbai on March 12, 1993. Yusuf, who was convicted to life imprisonment in 2007 by a TADA court, was brushing his teeth around 10.30am when he complained of chest pain to his brother, Issaq Memon, and collapsed, said Pramod Wagh, Superintendent of Nashik Central Jail. “Yusuf was rushed to Nashik civil hospital where he was died during treatment at 11am,” said Wagh, adding that Yusuf had “no known medical condition” and his body has been sent to Dhule Medical College for a post-mortem. “We have informed Altaf Shaikh, a family member of Yusuf, about his death.” Yusuf was sharing a cell with Issaq – also convicted in the 1993 blasts case – and 13 other prisoners. He was earlier lodged at Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai and later moved to Aurangabad prison. On December 12, 2018, he and Isaaq were shifted to Nashik, said Wagh. Another Memon brother, Yakub, who was arrested in the blasts case and convicted, was hanged in 2015 at Nagpur Central Jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tiger-memon-s-brother-1993-blasts-convict-dies-in-prison/story-R9iy7huc2P517qRYn3gqaO.html

The victim, Paramjit Singh, owner of Sona cattle feed factory, had a miraculous escape as the bullet hit the wall of his office.Paramjit told the police that two men arrived in a car and barged into his factory’s office on Thursday night. Holding a bag, they flashed a gun and asked him to handover all the cash in the office.When he resisted, they fired a shot that hit a wall. The duo then took Rs 1.75 lakh in cash from the office and his licensed revolver before fleeing towards Dhamot in a silver car, he said.Deputy superintendent of police (DSP, Khanna) Harpreet Singh said the police were scanning CCTV cameras installed in the area to identify the accused. They had formed several teams to track down the robbers, he added. A case of robbery has been registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/khanna-factory-owner-escapes-bullet-robbed-of-1-75-lakh-revolver/story-EqK3setmsecs4Uke2ERdrO.html
27-06-2020||Delhi||House-to-house Covid-19 screening begins in Delhi||Government officials in at least five revenue districts of the Capital started house-to-house screening of people across neighbourhoods on Friday, according to a five-point Covid-19 management plan chalked out after a meeting chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah last Sunday.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe screening exercise involves checking people for signs of flu such as fever, sore throat, cough and asking them about their travel history to map the virus. The aim is to identify people with Covid-like symptoms, create a comprehensive database and then get them tested. While the health survey is scheduled to be completed by July 6, several district officials still await a clear standard operating procedure (SOP).For now, the districts that have kick-started the exercise are largely relying on protocols prepared by magistrates and chief medical officers concerned, at least until an SOP is issued, senior government officials said.Delhi has around four million households, according to the records of the government’s planning department.For the screening exercise, the district officials have roped in civil defence volunteers, accredited social health activists (Asha), auxiliary nurse midwife workers, booth level officials (BLO) and municipal staff, including domestic breeding checkers, licensing inspectors and sanitation workers—apart from the government health workers who have experience on the job. With time, primary school teachers and clerical staff from zonal offices are likely to be roped in as well, a senior government official said.On Friday, the survey was conducted in neighbourhoods such as Karol Bagh, Keshav Puram and Civil Lines, among others. HT followed several such teams throughout the day. GROUND REPORTAround 11 am, over 30 DBC (domestic breeding checkers)—who play a major role in anti-dengue and anti-malaria drives — gathered at Dev Nagar dispensary in Karol Bagh zone to check people. After a short briefing about the process by the nodal officer, workers headed towards Reghar Pura nearby to start the campaign. People surveying households in containment zones wore PPE (personal protective equipment) kits, while those in non-containment zones wore basic safety gear such as masks and gloves. .In several households, residents cooperated and provided all details. But there were many where residents were unwilling to share any details.“Not every resident is cooperative. There are people living as tenants and do not want their landlords to know about any illness in their family because they fear losing their place of residence. We have to convince that it’s a public welfare exercise and a government order and they have to follow it,” a worker engaged in the survey said.Till 3 pm, the workers had covered nearly 1,100 houses in the area. Similar surveys were carried out in Bapa Nagar, Inderpuri, Kirti Nagar and Civil Lines on Friday.All wards have been attached to nearby dispensaries for necessary guidance. The information collected at the end of the exercise will be compiled by the chief district medical officer. At the ward-level, a nodal officer has been appointed to monitor the door-to-door screening. The nodal officer has to divide the jurisdiction into sectors and appoint a survey officer in each sector.The three municipal corporations have 5,500 mosquito breeding checkers and 71,000 sanitation workers. In the days to come, they are likely to be deployed in all 272 wards. The district administration, however, is yet to finalise a comprehensive manpower plan for the survey.QUESTIONS ASKEDThe workforce conducting house-to-house survey has a definite set of questions such as name, age, address, contact numbers.The questionnaire seeks specific information about any illness or flu-like symptoms or Covid-19 symptoms, travel history, information about elderly people and children. People were asked if they had been using the Aarogya Setu mobile application.The teams red flag houses where people with serious medical conditions live.Some districts used an app called ‘SS Corona’ wherein volunteers fill in answers to multiple-choice questions asked in each household.“By using this app, an excel sheet is prepared automatically each evening, and the report is sent to the state integrated disease surveillance programme,” said another district official. The data can then be used to map out areas that are reporting more fever cases and help in further surveillance activities, the official said.SOP AWAITEDDistricts that have initiated the drive have developed their own protocols. Several district officials said they were awaiting the SOPs.“In a joint meeting of the state and the central government held on 21 June (Sunday), the union home ministry had proposed a master plan to screen and survey every household in Delhi. The Centre had assured they have a ten-day strategy in their master plan. But the state government is waiting for detailed guidelines for a week now and has received none so far. Officials across the city are yet to see a uniform SOP,” said a senior government official.The plan is to be implemented by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, who reports to the Union home ministry. Its vice-chairman is chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.SYSTEM FOLLOWED“This exercise is similar to one we had earlier done in different containment zones and other areas where Covid-19 cases had emerged. We will give this information to the nodal officer who will pass it on to the area medical officer. The area medical officer will contact the concerned health officers to test those with flu-like symptoms,” a municipal official supervising the survey said.He said the target is to cover over 2,500-3,000 houses per day in one locality. He said it was the first day of the campaign so the first-day target could not be achieved. “The teams have been given a thermal gun to check temperatures. If anyone has signs of the infection, they are asked to go to the nearest testing centre. This will help the government recognise cases of Covid-19 early on—ensuring they reach the hospital on time or are isolated so that they do not spread the infection to others,” said one of the doctors from Delhi’s East district, on condition of anonymity.An official from the New Delhi district said their teams have been screening houses even outside the containment areas for a few days and there wouldn’t be any trouble in finishing the survey by the July 6 deadline. “We have intensified the survey and increased manpower from the civic bodies. The problem is that we have been asked to screen houses within the containment zones every day. This would be impossible given the current manpower we have,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/house-to-house-covid-19-screening-begins-in-delhi/story-MBttqwhnutcYkbJx1eqMbL.html
27-06-2020||Gurugram||District administration to impose lockdown-like restrictions on 8 municipal wards in Gurugram||The district administration on Friday identified eight municipal wards in the city as large outbreak regions (LOR) due to the high incidence of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in these areas. In order to slowdown the spread of infection and break the chain of transmission, the administration has now decided to impose stricter restrictions on the movement of residents in these areas and launch an intensive public health campaign, including screening and door-to-door rapid testing, among others. The order issued by Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, also stated that socio-economic activities in these areas must not suffer because of the restrictions. The restrictions in the large outbreak regions will come into effect from 10am on June 30 and will remain in force till July 14. The areas that have been categorised as LOR include ward no 4 (Dundahera police station road, Aggarwal Sweets Gali (Sector 21), Dundaher Community Centre Street, Vishal Mega Mart street; ward no 16 (Arjun Nagar, Jyoti Park, Madan Puri), Ward no 17 (Rattan Garden, Shivpuri), ward no 20 (Shivaji Nagar, Shanti Nagar), ward no 21 (Baldev Nagar, Firoz Gandhi Nagar, Ravi Nagar), ward no 22 (Heera Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, Shivaji Park), ward no 23 (Hari Nagar, Shakti Park), ward no 35 (Nathupur Abadi).Khatri said,”The decision has been taken to contain the spread of Covid-19 in those areas that have reported a high incidence of such cases. In these areas, the movement of the people will be curbed and an intense public health campaign will be carried out,” As per the directions, industrial activity will be permitted in these areas only if the workers stay inside the factory premises. Only essential shops and commercial establishments will be allowed to be opened. Supply of essential commodities shall be managed by the zonal administrator, Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board in association with drug control officer and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG). To restrict the movement of people in these areas, the police has been asked to identify exact boundaries, entry and exit points and put up barricades. If the movement of a person is unavoidable then the authorities will have to ensure Aarogya Setu application has been downloaded. Additionally, the administration has decided to launch an intense public health campaign that includes extensive spread of information, education and communication related to Covid-19 among the people of these areas. It has also proposed to fully sanitise these areas, hold intensive sampling and rapid testing, door-to-door screening and thermal scanning of all residents. If required, children below 10, pregnant women and senior citizens can be shifted to isolation facilities, the order stated.In another late night development, the district administration also issued a new order increasing the number of containment zones to 106 in the district. Gurugram will now have 99 containment zones, Pataudi four, Farukkhnagar one, and Sohna two such zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/district-administration-to-impose-lockdown-like-restrictions-on-eight-municipal-wards-in-gurugram/story-A96XuTG2ELVybKIVYlBPOM.html
27-06-2020||Gurugram||2 men, including an army man, arrested for stealing ₹1.29 lakh from ATM||The police on Thursday arrested two men, including an army man, for allegedly stealing ₹1.29 lakh after cutting open an ATM in Badshahpur on Monday. The police said the army man was under a debt of ₹30 lakh and decided to loot from an ATM to recoup a part of the losses and pay some of his debtors. He enrolled a friend and both learnt hacks on stealing from a video streaming website.On Tuesday morning, the police received information that at least two men had stolen ₹1.29 lakh from an ATM on Sohna road. Preliminary probe had found that the suspects had sprayed a chemical on the CCTV around 10pm on Monday and used an electronic cutter to steal cash from the ATM.The police said the suspects, identified as Praveen, 29, and Rahul, 24, both the natives of Hodal, Palwal, were arrested from Hodal on Thursday. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said, “Praveen, an army man, was posted as a sepoy in Jammu and had returned to his residence in Hodal in March for a break. After the lockdown was imposed, he could not return to Jammu and had been staying at his house. A police official, privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “Praveen had a debt of ₹30 lakh. He had borrowed money from several people for personal reasons and had lost several lakhs through investments in the share market. So, he planned to recoup his losses by stealing money from an ATM. He roped in his friend, Rahul, who earlier used to work at a factory and knew how to use an electronic cutter.”The police said the suspects had learnt how to steal money from ATMs by watching videos on YouTube. “During questioning, they confessed that they had seen videos on how to use a cutter to cut open an ATM and some hacks on thefts. They chose an ATM, which was unmanned, and outside the ATM, a JCB had been operational for some construction activity. The suspects said that the JCB would filter any noise during the break-in,” said the police official quoted above. The police said the suspects had parked their motorcycle 700 metres from the ATM, which the police were able to trace by going through the footage of 25 CCTVs in the area. The suspects were produced in a district court on Friday and sent to police custody for two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/2-men-including-an-army-man-arrested-for-stealing-1-29-lakh-from-atm/story-uurJkYcu2XFVSOKMSRpDZM.html
27-06-2020||City||Containment zones in city to witness stricter measures||Gurugram: The authorities said Friday that strict measures in containment zones and hotspots in the city to slowdown the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease are expected to be taken soon. According to the district administration, the state was moving towards unlocking public movement and there was no reason to implement a citywide lockdown; it is instead planning to enforce stricter measures in areas where the number of Covid cases were high.The health authorities in the city have identified several wards which have witnessed a high number of Covid-19 cases. It now plans to check the spread of the disease in these areas.Downplaying the idea of re-imposing the lockdown, which was proposed by Gurugram MLA Sudhir Singhla, deputy commissioner Amit Khatri said: “The country is moving towards unlocking and in such a scenario there is no reason to implement the lockdown again. We have no plans in this regard.” Khatri made the announcement in an address to the media Friday afternoon along with Gurugram municipal commissioner (GMC) Vinay Pratap Singh and deputy commissioner of police Nitika Gahlaut, at John Hall in Civil Lines.To check the spread of the pandemic, the administration is now planning to deploy additional police force at the exit and entry points of containment zones so that movement of people is restricted. “Inside these zones, the unfettered movement of people would be checked and it would be ensured that people wear masks and follow social distancing rules,” said Khatri. There are also plans to install CCTV cameras in these areas to keep a watch. Apart from enforcing social distancing along with other safeguards, Khatri said that there was a need to ensure intensive screening of the residents of these areas, which would be done by the health department.“We will focus on intensive health screening, rapid testing and contact tracing in these areas so that the spread of this virus is checked. House-to-house surveys will be conducted and focus would also be on making people aware about what needs to be done to stay safe,” he said.To boost the immunity of residents in containment zones, the administration will also get immunity booster medicine kits distributed through the Ayush department, which has already given out around 1.80 lakh kits in the city.TRACKING THOSE IN HOME ISOLATION The city police, meanwhile, said all measures are being taken to ensure containment zones are monitored and regulated. According to Gahlaut, as many as 2,000 police personnel are engaged in managing the response to Covid-19. “These police personnel have been deployed near containment zones and hospitals and around inter-state check posts. We identify containment zones, prepare a sealing plan and enforce it in tandem with the district administration” Gahlaut said.She further said the police have also constituted a dedicated Covid-19 cell at its district headquarters to enforce strict adherence to home isolation norms by residents. “So far, the cell has reached out to 1,617 persons under home quarantine. We are also engaged in geo-fencing using mobile phones and the Aarogya Setu application. Police officials have advised those in home isolation to keep their phones running at all times, and also requested them to download the Aarogya Setu app,” she said. The DCP further said that at least 67 policemen have been infected so far and most of them have recovered. Currently, only eight personnel are infected. She informed that a dedicated quarantine centre has been set up in Manesar by the district administration for police personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/containment-zones-in-city-to-witness-stricter-measures/story-4VQPIDxnUeaR66C3JINgKN.html
27-06-2020||Gurugram||Haryana fixes package rates of Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals||The state health department, on Friday, issued an order capping the daily package rates for Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals between ₹8000- ₹18,000. This move reduces the treatment rates by up to 64% after high costs of treating critical Covid-19 patients were heavily criticised in the public domain. The new package rates for Covid-19 treatment includes all laboratory investigation, radiological investigation and diagnostic procedures. Additionally, drugs, consumables, including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and masks are also covered. It also incorporates monitoring charges, such as doctor’s consultation, nursing care, physiotherapy, etc. Charges of procedures, such as intubation, intra-arterial catheterization, chest tube, cardio-diversion, hemodialysis, echocardiography, among others, are covered by it. The rates are also inclusive of the cost of medical care of underlying co-morbid conditions. The same rates are applicable for children who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. The order, however, gives no clarity on whether the rates charged by private hospitals are inclusive of the charges of the facilities provided in the high-end rooms, such as deluxe and super deluxe categories of rooms. The treatment costs also do not include costs of experimental therapies, such Ramdesivir. Pregnant women having either normal or C-section delivery have also been left out of the package. Neo-natal care has also been excluded. In such cases, hospitals can charge extra as per the prevailing Ayushman Bharat packages.As per the order, the per day rates in hospitals accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare providers (NABH) are ₹10,000 for isolation beds, ₹15,000 for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds without ventilator, and ₹18,000 for ICU beds with ventilator. Likewise, the rates in non-NABH accredited hospitals will be ₹8,000, ₹13,000 and ₹15,000 respectively. Some of the major hospitals of the city are currently charging over ₹20,000 for general beds, ₹40,000 for ICU beds, and ₹50,000-80,000 for ICU beds with ventilators. There are at least 40 hospitals, including two government hospitals, in the city treating Covid-19 patients. “The disparity in charges across various private hospitals is hampering access for inpatient hospital care. Therefore, the rates of various facilities in private hospitals or medical colleges need to be standardized for Covid-19 patient (sic),” read the order issued by the director-general of health services. Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, said, “Covid-19 treatment cost is being standardised for the benefit of patients who require hospitalisation. In fixing the package rate for the state, we are going with the recommendations of Dr VK Paul committee. It will be uniformity with other parts of Delhi-NCR.”Notably, in Union minister of home affairs, in a meeting with officials of Delhi-NCR earlier this week, gave the mandate to consider Delhi-NCR as one unit for Covid-19 management. Earlier this week, the Delhi government too had capped the treatment costs, following the recommendations of the Dr V K Paul committee. Almost similar price packages are being followed in other states of India, such as Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Telangana.The Haryana government, exercising the power under the Epidemic Diseases Act, also said that no hospital or medical college in the state would charge an amount in excess of the prescribed limit. Reacting to the new rates, Dr Naresh Trehan, founder and CEO of Medanta Medicity, said, “Our priority is to protect the patient. It is certainly a problem that the treatment cost has dropped. We are incurring huge losses. But people need to be saved.” When asked about the charges of deluxe rooms, he said, “There is no clarity on the issue.” As per the government order, the new rates would be applicable to all Covid-19 beds in private hospitals, up to a maximum capacity of 60% of the total beds. According to a senior government official, privy to the matter, only 60% of the beds can be reserved in private hospitals for Covid-19 patients. “We have reserved 25% beds so far, which can now be exceed up to 35% only,” said the official. The state government in the last two months has issued a series of orders on fixing the package rates of Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals. As per earlier orders, state government employees, pensioners and their dependents can avail Covid-19 treatment as per the government’s reimbursement policies. Arora said, “Any patient who has public or private health insurance will avail the treatment as per the policy clauses, while the beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat scheme would be covered under it.”As per the rates under the Ayushman Bharat scheme, the per day cost of beds is between ₹2,000 and ₹5,000.If a patient does not fit in any of the above-mentioned categories, then the hospitals will charge as per the new fixed rates. The state government would reimburse the expenditure as per Ayushman Bharat scheme. The balance amount will have to paid by the patient. Out of the final medical bill, the details of the portion covered under the Ayushman Bharat scheme will have to be submitted to the civil surgeon. The bills submitted by the private hospitals will be reimbursed to them only after the verification by a committee chaired by civil surgeon (chief medical officer) and district nodal officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-fixes-package-rates-of-covid-19-treatment-in-private-hospitals/story-QDf0Llf5jEj5hEOQzqJ6GO.html
27-06-2020||City||As CBSE reworks method of evaluation, students from northeast Delhi unsure of options||New Delhi: While the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) notification on the revised assessment scheme in place of board exams brought closure for many parents and students on Friday, candidates from northeast Delhi, which was rocked by communal riots earlier this year, are still uncertain about their future.The board on Friday said there are “very few students of class 12, mainly from Delhi, who have appeared in the examination in only one or two subjects. Their results will be declared based on performance in the appeared subjects and performance in internal/practical/project assessment.”Mohammad Arsh, a class 12 student of Victoria Public School in Yamuna Vihar, said the revised assessment scheme is likely to be a disadvantage for him. “My English paper, which was pending, will be graded on the basis of the Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Physical Education papers that I appeared for. These are difficult subjects compared to English where scoring is easier. Most students who perform well in English tend to have a higher best-of-four score. In case I try for the Delhi University, my low aggregate might prove to be a hindrance.” He also said that many of his friends were unable to appear for multiple papers and run the risk of getting sub-par scores, unlike the rest of the students.Due to the communal violence, which had spread in various northeast Delhi localities in late February, the CBSE was unable to conduct tests on four examination days and “a very small number of students from and around this district were not able to appear in exams on six examination days,” the board had said in April.On Friday, it said that class 10 students across the country, including northeast Delhi, would be promoted on the basis of the revised assessment scheme, under which their pending papers would be graded on the basis of the average of their three or two best scores in the papers they had already appeared for.Gulsara Kamal, a class 10 student of St Lawrence Public School in Dilshad Garden, said, “My English and Hindi papers were pending, which generally help students fetch more marks in board exams and improve our aggregate. Now, these exams have been cancelled. I was hoping to switch schools after my results as my current school doesn’t have the subjects I want to study. If the revised assessment scheme affects my aggregate, I might not be able to do that.”The results of all students will be declared by July 15, based on the revised assessment scheme, the board said.While class 10 students will not get a chance to appear for improvement papers, the Board has allowed class 12 students to appear for optional exams, which may be conducted at a later stage when the situation is “conducive”, so as to improve upon their performance. Jyoti Rani, principal of Arun Modern Public School which was damaged in the riots, said, “Students have approached teachers for clarifications and what the CBSE revised assessment would mean for them. A lot of students were unable to appear for exams as they could not travel to exam centres or had gone back to their home towns. They are now concerned if this will affect their undergraduate admissions.“Most of the documents in our school were damaged in the fire,” Rani further said, adding, “Though we had sent the marks for internal assessment, we don’t have the projects with us anymore. We are a little concerned about what we would do if the board asked for the projects.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-cbse-reworks-method-of-evaluation-students-from-northeast-delhi-unsure-of-options/story-EB3Vc8HLguDyZ4BdrkSJwI.html
27-06-2020||Delhi||Plasma therapy has helped reduce Covid-19 death rate by more than 50% at LNJP Hospital: Delhi CM Kejriwal||Plasma therapy, which involves the transfer of blood from a recovered Covid-19 patient to someone who is stricken by the disease, has helped reduce the Covid-19 death rate by more than half at Lok Nayak Hospital, the only local government hospital authorised to conduct trials based on the therapy, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday. He also said the Delhi government was focussing increasing intensive care unit (ICU) beds in the city as soon as possible as the number of coronavirus disease cases increases.When asked, Lok Nayak hospital said they were not authorised to share the number of deaths in the hospital, and the chief minister’s office said they were still compiling the data.“We administered plasma therapy to 29 patients in Lok Nayak Hospital and the results were shared with the Central government, following which we got permission for 200 more trials,” Kejriwal said at a virtual media briefing after a meeting of his Cabinet. “And now, plasma therapy will be done in the Delhi government’s Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital too. Other than that, several private hospitals have acquired permission for plasma therapy trials on their own.” The cabinet meeting approved a move to earmark 450 beds for patients of the disease at a new hospital in Burari, which will be turned into a Covid-19 facility.Eight hospitals in Delhi are conducting plasma therapy trials. They include Lok Nayak as well as the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital, which come under the Central government, and five prominent private hospitals. The results of the trials, said senior officials in Delhi’s health department, will be made public only after they are published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.Kejriwal said the Covid-19 fatality rate in LN Hospital dropped by more than 50% n the past few weeks because of plasma therapy. “The trends suggest it is difficult to save the lives of patients who are on ventilator support or have already witnessed multiple organ failures. But for other patients with moderate to severe symptoms, plasma therapy helped save lives,” he said. He attributed a spike in Covid-19 cases in the city over the past week to increased testing. “Till now, we have around 74,000 Covid-19 cases in Delhi. But if we analyse the trend, the situation is under control…Tests have been increased to around 18,000 per day, from 5,000 to 6,000 per day. With that, the average cases per day have increased from 2,000 to 2,500 to around 3,000 to 3,500. This increase is natural.”He added: “But people are recovering at a fast rate too. There are around 26,000 active patients now, of which around 6,000 are in hospitals. The others are recovering at their residences. In the last one week, total bed occupancy has remained around 6,000 on an average, despite around 3,000 to 3,500 patients adding up every day. Which means most cases are patients with mild or no symptoms. However, we have around 13,500 beds ready in hospitals, of which around 7,500 are vacant on an average.“In the coming days, we may need to scale up ICU beds, especially in GTB, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital and Lok Nayak hospital. We are doing our best to accomplish this at the earliest.”Kejriwal identified his government’s decision to distribute pulse oximeters to patients in home isolation as a measure that has helped reduce Covid-19-related deaths.“In Covid-19 cases, we have seen oxygen levels can suddenly drop even in cases of patients with mild symptoms. So, we stared delivering oximeters to all cases of home isolation so that patients can keep assessing their oxygen levels periodically, and call a helpline number the moment they see the saturation level drop to 94% or less.”“Plasma therapy uses the antibodies produced in one person who has recovered from the infection to fight off the virus in another. It is a passive kind of immunisation, where the antibodies of another person help neutralise some of the virus in the body thereby preventing the progression of the disease. This means the therapy has to be administered in patients who are moderate but progressing towards a severe disease. Current evidence from across the world shows that there is some recovery benefits of the therapy, especially those on ventilators” said Dr Neeraj Gupta, a professor from the department of respiratory medicine at Safdarjung hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/plasma-therapy-has-helped-reduce-covid-19-death-rate-by-more-than-50-at-lnjp-hospital-delhi-cm-kejriwal/story-whQLicBuY1ouArHZKd0UhN.html
27-06-2020||Delhi||1000-bed DRDO facility near Delhi airport to be operational by next month||Wooden slabs were being laid out and the ground was being levelled with multiple machines set in motion at a large open field. The white makeshift tents, the roofs and the pillars being placed could be spotted right from the road near Mehram Nagar village in southwest Delhi, which goes up to the Delhi Airport’s domestic terminal.Construction work is on in full swing at the site to turn the place into a full-fledged temporary air-conditioned 1,000-bedded Covid facility to meet the need for more beds to house Covid-19 patients in view of the rapid surge in cases. Till Friday, Delhi had recorded 77,240 cases of the disease.The facility is being readied by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), which is under the Ministry of Defence. It has been roped in by the Union Home Ministry for the construction. The Directorate of Civil Works and Estates (DCW&E), a wing of the DRDO, is handling the construction. Officials said the hospital is likely to come up by early next month.According to officials at the site, the facility is coming up on around 25,000 square metres of land belonging to the Indian Air Force. Besides, patients and doctors’ blocks, a testing lab and a pharmacy will come up. A mortuary is also being planned.“The structure is coming up fast to meet the need for extra beds for Covid-19 patients. All services will be available within the premises, from testing of samples to accommodation for staff. There will be a patient block with four hut-shaped sections housing 250 beds each. In each of the huts, there will be around 120 cabins such that two patients can stay per cabin,” Gagan Wadhwa, chief construction engineer (CCE), DRDO said.Of the four sections to house patients, one will be dedicated for ICU beds with oxygen support. The complete facility will be fully air-conditioned.“The facility is being designed as per World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines for hospital care. Every bed will have oxygen support so that patients do not need to be shifted in case of a sudden drop in oxygen levels. Each section will have a set of toilets and bathrooms,” he said.Authorities said they are working on logistics of shifting patients to the centre, and which hospital will be attached to the facility. Patients will be given charging points for mobile phones/laptops and storage units by their beds to keep their belongings. Alongside the patients’ block, will be the doctors’ area where patients will be assessed, plus another area to house the medical staff.“Two doctors will be on duty for assessment. A separate block with cabins and an attached set of toilets is being built to provide on-site accommodation to around 50 doctors and paramedic staff. A cafeteria will be set up for medical staff,” said another senior official on site, who did not wish to be named. Authorities said they were working out provisions for food and other such services.The doctors’ block will have a donning and doffing area for personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. There will be a three-metre corridor for the movement of medical and support staff in order to maintain physical distancing.The DRDO has tied up with BSES for power supply and back-up while Delhi Jal Board will be provide water supply. “A separate waste disposal and sewage management system is being developed. We were able to get water and power connections in such a short time because of the support of the union home ministry,” Wadhwa said.On Tuesday, union home minister Amit Shah had tweeted: “I would also like to inform the people of Delhi that a 1,000 bed full-fledged hospital with 250 ICU beds is being developed for Covid patients. DRDO and Tata Trust are building the facility. Armed forces personnel will man it. This Covid Care centre will be ready in next 10 days.”The Covid facility is being built to augment hospital infrastructure in the national capital. The Centre is collaborating with the Delhi government to set up adequate number of beds to cater to patients after a spike in Covid-19 cases.This will be the second such facility to be manned by armed personnel after the 10,000-bedded one at Chhattarpur Radha Soami Satsang Beas, where a large part of the facility is set to be operational from Friday and will be manned by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1000-bed-drdo-facility-near-delhi-airport-to-be-operational-by-next-month/story-fEILsKiwRrEA8Ed2HMUO1K.html

27-06-2020||City||BLOs roped in for door-to-door survey worried about safety, want adequate safety gear||New Delhi: Deployed as front line workers in the fight against Covid-19, booth level officers (BLOs), who have now been roped in for the door-to-door screening that began on Friday, say they are ready for the job but need adequate protective gear to keep themselves from getting infected. BLOs are grassroots-level workers -- mostly drawn from government school teachers and aanganwadi workers -- engaged in voter identification and other election-related exercises . Delhi has more than 13,000 BLOs. So far, only BLOs living in containment zones were assigned the task of contact tracing work along with Accredited Social Health Workers (ASHA) workers and Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANMs). Now with the door-to-door survey starting-- as per the Union home ministry’s recommendations -- all BLOs have been roped for in the mammoth city-wide exercise that has to be completed by July 6. The BLOs say they have to visit at least 300-350 houses during this time and there are chances they may get infecting and put their families at risk. These BLOs are paid Rs 1000 per month throughout the year for poll duties. During elections. they do get some extra benefits but so far no other compensation has been announced for Covid workSarita Singh (33), a BLO who teaches at a government school in east Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar said, “We have been visiting houses and making calls to people in containment zones. In the name of protective gear, all we have is a mask and sanitiser. I fear carrying the infection home. At least, we should get face shields.” A day before, Singh said, a BLO on duty in a nearby area died of Covid-19. There is a lot of anxiety among workers. Santosh Kumar, a BLO and a Sanskrit teacher in Mandawali who was on duty in a containment zone and had just turned 60 on June 21, died of Covid-19 on June 24. “My father was due to retire on June 30. He was a heart patient and applied for leave. But he was put on duty. They were not given any protective gear except for a mask. He developed Covid symptoms on June 9. A private doctor said it was viral fever and gave some medicines. On June 15, he had breathing difficulty and we rushed him to the clinic where we told his oxygen levels had dropped and he needs to be shifted to a hospital. Aday after, his report came positive and he died on Wednesday,” Mukesh Kumar, his son, said. Earlier this month, two government teachers and a principal working on ration distribution work and at hunger relief centres died of Covid-19. Last month, a municipal corporation teacher and a security guard on Covid duty died. District officials, however, said all ground workers who make home visits, including ASHA, ANMs and BLOs, get masks, gloves, shoe covers and face shields. So far, these have been given one time.Sumit Kumar, a lab assistant, said he will cover at least 1,200 people in his area, which will mean at least 400 houses. “We have been working all this time without any safety. We have been asked to collect material such as notes and thermal screening guns from the office. I hope they give us some safety gear as well,” said Kumar. A senior Delhi government official said, “For all the workers, protective gear has been procured and is being distributed. In some areas, it will start tomorrow as the survey is yet to take off in some places.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/blos-roped-in-for-door-to-door-survey-worried-about-safety-want-adequate-safety-gear/story-aaYSSh3o6VEinb2EQ0Vl8H.html
27-06-2020||Gurugram||MCG to collect biomedical waste on two days per week from each ward||In order to reduce the risk of transmission of Covid-19 and cope with logistical difficulties, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram(MCG) has decided to restrict the collection of biomedical waste from each of its 35 wards to two fixed days in a week, said officials of the civic body on Friday. The decision comes after several residents, especially those who are under home isolation, complained that collection of biomedical waste in the city was not taking place properly. As per MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, there are more than 1,500 people who are currently under home isolation in the city. The civic body has hence streamlined the process of collecting biomedical waste in such a manner that risks of exposure to the virus can be reduced to a bare minimum. Further, people under home isolation only need to step outside their houses for two days in a week to dump waste. The civic body has further divided the city into four zones and has allocated an area supervisor for each of these zones. As per MCG’s schedule, the civic body will collect waste from wards 1-4, 10-13, 25, 26, 30 and 31 on Monday and Thursday. Wards 5-8, 14-16, 20, 27, 28, 32 and 33 will be catered to on Tuesday and Friday. Finally, waste from wards 9, 17-19, 21-24, 29, 34 and 35 will be collected on Wednesday and Saturday. MCG has also created a toll-free helpline number —18001805952 — for residents to lodge any complaint in regarding the collection of biomedical waste. “Our staff involved in both collection and transportation of biomedical waste visit thousands of households across the city every day. This measure has been taken so that our staff members do not turn into mass carriers of the virus,” said Vinay Pratap Singh.“From now on, any person from the family under quarantine can dump their garbage into the MCG vehicles after ensuring they are wearing masks and gloves and are maintaining social distance. In condominiums, a staff member from the RWA can also be allocated for doing the same,” he said.Singh also highlighted logistic issues as another factor for streamlining the waste collection process.“Each of our staff members covers multiple condominiums, societies, gated colonies, and independent floors, across the city every day. Hence, it will also be virtually impossible for them to visit every quarantined household individually and collect waste. As such, it was necessary to streamline the process of waste collection,” said Singh. Singh also mentioned that the MCG has fined around 800 people for not wearing masks and collected fines in excess of ₹4 lakh for it. He further said that 18 residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) have already established isolation centres in their respective condominiums, societies and gated colonies. Both MCG and the administration are assisting more such RWAs for setting up isolation centres within their housing complexes.Singh also said that there are currently no plans for opening any religious institutions in the city and that in order to provide employment to voluntary groups located in urban and rural areas of Gurugram district, the MCG has assigned to them the task of making masks. An amount of ₹4 or ₹5 is being given for every mask they produce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-collect-biomedical-waste-on-two-days-per-week-from-each-ward/story-nORstHMvEMb2NRTtC1dDgO.html
27-06-2020||Mumbai||Courts can’t provide permanent protection against cyber fraud: Bombay HC to HUL||The Bombay high court (HC) expressed its inability to provide permanent protection to business houses from fraudulent websites that use deceptive domain names, similar to those used by a brand, to cheat citizens.The court was hearing a plea filed by Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), seeking orders for suspending and blocking several websites and e-mail addresses launched using its generic name or its deceptively similar variants, after it noticed that those were fraudulently being used for luring unsuspecting public into parting with significant amounts of money on a completely false promise of being made authorised dealers of HUL products. One such site had defrauded some individuals of over ₹70 lakh.“Eternal vigilance is not just the price of liberty; it is also the cost of doing large-volume business,”a single-bench of Justice Gautam Patel held. Justice Patel in his 16-page order also explained how ‘trivial’ it was to get a domain name registered, and how difficult it is to ensure continued suspension of a domain name.“One only has to look up availability of a combination of words and choose a desired top-level or other domain (.in, .com, .net, etc),” said the judge, adding, “The entire process of registration is automated and requires no manual intervention.”Justice Patel held that it was not possible for a continued suspension of such domain names because the registration is only for a limited period, and the domain name becomes available for fresh registration once the period is over.The court also pointed out that blocking access to websites was of seriously doubtful efficacy. Justice Patel said any such ‘block’ can be easily circumvented by using a commonly available Virtual Private Network (VPN) to connect to another network, by-passing region restrictions, shielding browsing activity and so on.He added that though access to such bypassing technology is still not common, and the average user may not know about it or even how to use it, VPN products are available for mobile phone platforms as well now.“Therefore, other than lulling an applicant into a completely hollow and faux sense of safety (and conceivably giving some ill-informed government functionary an entirely unwarranted sense of power or authority), blocking access achieves next to nothing,” noted the bench.Justice Patel instead suggested that HUL should take up the matter with the domain name registrars concerned for suspending the infringing domain name, and move HC with a fresh plea, if the matter is not resolved at that level.HC said there was no doubt that the registration of these domain names was entirely mala fide and constituted an infringement of HUL’s valuable statutory and common law rights. The court, however, rejected the consumer giant’s another plea urging the court to devise a suitable mechanism and pass appropriate orders to effectively deal with further fraudulent domain names, websites, e-mail addresses which may be encountered by the company.“I do not think it is for any court to come up with mechanisms to protect the plaintiff’s interest at low or no cost,” said justice Patel rejecting the company’s plea for perpetual protection by ordering blocking of such offending websites and e-mail addresses that might noticed later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/courts-can-t-provide-permanent-protection-against-cyber-fraud-bombay-hc-to-hul/story-XunvChUBgzmVqQWtjIhWyI.html
27-06-2020||Chandigarh||Open manholes, potholed roads in Ludhiana pose threat to residents during rainy season||While the civic body is making tall claims regarding monsoon preparedness, broken manhole covers and potholed roads in different parts of the city are giving an open invitation to road accidents during the rainy season.Potholes can be witnessed on both main and internal roads in Dugri, Model Town Extension, Shastri Nagar, Giaspura among other areas. Apart from potholes, gravel spread on roads is also a major threat to two-wheelers riders as vehicles skid over the gravel.A shopkeeper in Preet Nagar of Shimlapuri, Gurjit Singh, said, “The condition of manhole covers is pathetic in their area even though deputy mayor Sarabjit Kaur represents the ward in the General House of the MC. At a coverless manhole, residents have placed bricks around it to avoid accidents. However, accidents can take place at such places when roads are flooded during rainy season.”A resident of Dugri, Baljeet Singh, said, “Roads in their area have been in a bad shape for a long time. During the rainy season, it becomes difficult for people to judge a pothole on the road due to accumulated water. Accidents have also taken place in the past, but no one is paying heed to the problem.”Difference in the level of roads and manhole covers is also a major issue, as a sudden bump makes it difficult for a commuter to balance the two-wheeler.Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) councillor, representing ward number 2, Gurmail Singh Jajji, said, “Manhole covers in Khajoor colony, 30 Feet Road and main Bahadurke Road are in a bad shape. After the construction of roads in the area, there is a difference between the level of roads and manholes, which gives a bumpy ride to the commuters. Also, it is difficult to judge the manholes due to water accumulation.”Despite attempts made to reach MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal, he was not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/open-manholes-potholed-roads-in-ludhiana-pose-threat-to-residents-during-rainy-season/story-MUNbq65EXMzIbYzeLzIzGI.html

The police said he suffered eight gunshot wounds and died on the spot. Personal enmity is suspected to be the alleged reason, the police said, adding that a case of murder has been lodged.The police said that the deceased has been identified as Virendra Ram, a resident of Chungi number 1 in Sohna, who had a brick kiln business in Palwal.According to the police, the incident took place at 10.40am when Virendra Ram was sitting on a chair outside his house. According to the police, a white Alto car, in which at least three men were seated, stopped outside his house, and two men alighted from the car.A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “Both the suspects were armed and they started firing indiscriminately at the victim before escaping in the car. He suffered at least eight gunshot wounds on his body and was rushed to the Civil Hospital in Sohna, where doctors declared him dead on arrival.”Prima facie, the police said the man was killed over “personal enmity”, adding that they were interviewing the members of his family to ascertain the exact reason.The victim’s brother, Narendra, said, “I was sitting in an office space, which we have opened in our house, when the incident took place. I heard gunshots and immediately rushed out of the room. I saw two men escape in a car but could not note down the registration number. My brother did not mention of a specific threat or rivalry with anyone. We don’t know who could have done this.”A case has been registered against the unidentified suspects under sections 302 (punishment for murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code at City Sohna police station on Friday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/brick-kiln-owner-shot-dead-over-personal-enmity-in-sohna/story-5vNWStNeLMwpnKyE5UCdaN.html

MSEDCL will also organise webinars related to bills.These cells will comprise officials from the technical, finance, accounting and IT departments. Apart from this, the power distribution company will also arrange meetings in societies to address queries. The state distribution agency supplies power to 2.30 crore consumers in Maharashtra.“We will try to address all the doubts raised by consumers. We will also adhere to social distancing norms while addressing the meetings,” a senior official from MSEDCL said.Consumers have taken over social media to complain about inflated bills received in the last week.Owing to the lockdown and as per the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) guidelines, meter-reading was suspended in March-end and consumers were billed as per average usage in the months of December, January and February. MSEDCL and other distribution companies, however, started actual meter reading in June (except in containment zones) and have released combined bills to consumers. The companies have maintained that there are no errors and the bills reflect actual usage.Tata Power, which has seven lakh consumers in Mumbai and Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML), which has 27 lakh consumers in the city, has also stated that usage has increased owing to consumers being home 24*7 during the lockdown.In a statement released recently, Tata Power said, “For the period of 91 days for which the bills are being sent out, the family remained inside the home for all 24 hours. Tata Power would like the consumers to look for such lifestyle changes while reflecting over the last three months of lockdown and compare it with pre-lockdown lifestyle or last year same months.”An AEML spokesperson said, “Bills were generated on the lower side being an average of preceding three months - Dec, Jan and Feb, which are winter months. Actual consumption in the months of Apr, May and June is comparatively higher due to seasonal impact (summer) and increased usage (the advent of lockdown/ work from home).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/inflated-bills-msedcl-s-special-cells-to-look-into-complaints/story-9dZz1MwikutFLHvH3RTHbN.html
27-06-2020||City||Sero survey from Saturday||New DelhiDelhi government health teams will start collecting blood samples across Delhi from Saturday to detect the presence of virus-fighting antibodies in the population to know the spread of Covid-19. Phlebotomists – or lab technicians – from government-run dispensaries and mohalla clinics will collect 20,000 samples from across 11 districts in Delhi by July 10.“People will not have to come to testing centres for the antibody sample collection. It is a simple blood draw that can be done at their homes with minimal risk of the infection spreading. The samples will be sent to NCDC for processing,” said a district official. The district teams had been trained by experts from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the processes to be followed were discussed Friday evening. However, no formal SOPs or guidelines were received.“Yes, we are all set to roll out the survey tomorrow, all the protocols are in place,” said an NCDC official on condition of anonymity.Every district will have to collect about 2,000 samples that is statistically representative of the population of Delhi. “The samples have to be collected from within and outside the containment zones. It has to be collected from rich and poor neighbourhoods. A method of random sampling has been decided upon by NCDC and we have to just follow the methodology to collect the samples,” said another district official.Officials say that the biggest hurdle for the sero-surveillance will be manpower.“We already have our health teams conducting the door-to-door screening, antigen testing, contact tracing, and checking people’s home for suitability of home isolation. All activities need some level of medical understanding and our staff is already stretched thin. For sero-surveillance too we will need trained technicians who can draw blood,” said a third district official, on condition of anonymity.Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, in a late evening meeting on Thursday, reviewed the implementation of various decisions pertaining to Covid-19 situation in Delhi which were taken in a meeting by home minister Amit Shah on June 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sero-survey-from-saturday/story-kV9ZbLBgvut8qn9o40emKL.html

As online education slowly becomes the norm amid the coronavirus pandemic, several colleges in the region are also organising webinars on different themes for teachers who would earlier attend seminars and get participation certificates. These certificates are factored into their annual assessments. “ Earlier as per University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines, teachers were attending various seminars and now webinars have replaced seminars. Teachers get benefited from such webinars as eminent educationists from various universities and departments deliver lectures and present research papers as well,” Dr RK Gupta, RHEO, said. To ensure participants took the webinars seriously, the RHEO has directed the colleges to questionnaires for the teachers. “I have directed webinar organisers to prepare questionnaires based using Google Forms on topics delivered by the speakers. The organizers should get this questionnaire filled from each participant. This will give us the exact picture on how much attention were the participants paying. If participants answer more than 50% of questions correctly, only then should they be given the participation certificates. ,” Dr Gupta said.The move comes in the light of the RHEO receiving complaints about teachers not attending the webinars seriously and only participating for the sake of getting certificates.“There were complaints that several participants just took part in the webinars for getting the participation certificates. Many participants would often switch off their videos and audios during the webinar making it difficult to access whether they are actively participating or not,” said Gupta. “ There were instances where participants would just put up their pictures in front of the camera instead of attending the webinar themselves.”Several colleges have already started making the participating teachers fill questionnaires. Dr RS Panwar, officiating principal, Mihir Bhoj Postgraduate Degree College, Dadri, said: “We are issuing participation certificates to teachers only if they get more than 50% answers on the questionnaire correct.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/college-teachers-to-be-quizzed-before-they-get-participation-certificates-for-attending-webinars/story-KBy62aYvvDGEn816E6WQ3J.html

Jain tested negative for the infection earlier on Friday, according to sources from Max Hospital in Saket, where he was admitted.He had been initially admitted to the Delhi government-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital (RGSSH) in Tahirpur on June 15, the day he had attended an all-party meet with Union home minister Amit Shah, but was moved to the private hospital after his condition deteriorated on June 19 (Friday). He was shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and administered plasma therapy the same night.Following this, his condition improved and he was moved to the general ward of the hospital on Monday.Jain’s first Covid-19 test came back negative but a subsequent test on June 17 came back positive.At RGSSH, he had been put on intermittent oxygen support to raise his oxygen saturation. “The oxygen support was removed once the saturation reached about 97%. However, he was not able to maintain the saturation and had to be put on oxygen intermittently,” a doctor at the government-run hospital had told HT on condition of anonymity.However, on Friday morning his condition deteriorated – he started feeling dizzy and tired. His CT scan showed that his pneumonia, a known complication of Covid-19, had increased after which he was shifted to the private hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-health-minister-tests-negative-for-covid-19-discharged/story-TQLeHkvm0Y70xsCLuhGQEP.html
27-06-2020||Delhi||DU admissions won’t be affected by changes in CBSE’s evaluation process: Officials||Ending the apprehensions of students seeking admission to honours courses, for which the Central Board of Secondary Education’s (CBSE)’s Class 12 exam could not be held due to the Covid-19 pandemic, officials in the Delhi University (DU) on Friday said that they would consider the board’s alternative plan of evaluation for these subjects. They also said that the changes in the CBSE’s evaluation mode would not affect the DU’s merit-based admission process for undergraduate courses, which started on June 20 and would continue till August. The University is yet to release the release dates for the cut-off lists.The DU officials said that students will be able to take admission to all courses, irrespective of whether they have appeared in the exam of that particular subject.The CBSE, on Thursday, informed the Supreme Court that it would not conduct the remaining exams for classes 10 and 12, scheduled between July 1 and July 15, due to the pandemic. The board, on Friday, issued a detailed plan under which the remaining exams would be evaluated based on the average of the top two or three exams students appeared for, before the lockdown to contain the Covid-19 pandemic was announced.However, those who could appear in only one or two exams will be evaluated based on those subjects and internal assessments. These students will also get a chance to appear in exams conducted by the CBSE to improve their marks later. The board will announce the results of the Class 12 exams by July 15.Soon after the board’s announcement, students of Class 12 seeking admissions to courses for which exams were pending raised a few concerns regarding a possible dip in their overall scores. Exams for 12 subjects, including Hindi, geography, business studies, biotechnology, computer science and sociology, are yet to be held across the country. An additional 11 subjects are pending for Class 12 students in northeast Delhi, where exams were suspended due to the communal riots.However, DU’s Dean of Admissions Shobha Bagai said that the average marks of students are generally the same every year, which is why CBSE’s changed evaluation process would not affect the University’s admission process. “If we look at the bigger picture now, the CBSE’s changed evaluation process will not affect the merit-based admission process for undergraduate courses much. Generally, the average marks of all subjects are more or less the same. It would have been a problem if they were not marking the subjects for which exams cannot be conducted,” she said.Bagai said that the University’s admission committee would hold a meeting next week to discuss the changes brought in by the CBSE. “We will still wait for a while before announcing anything in case the CBSE comes up with some more clarifications. Otherwise, we don’t have a reason to make any change in the admission process,” she saidIn DU, for admission to BA (Hons) or BSc (Hons) courses in any subject, one has to include the particular subject in which the admission is sought while calculating the average of ‘best of four’. Failing which, there is a deduction of 2.5% marks from the average.AK Bhagi, a former member of the DU’s executive council, said, “If the CBSE board is marking all subjects irrespective of whether a student has appeared for the exam, DU will not have to make any changes in the admission process. The issue would have arisen if there were no marks given in some subjects. Now, even those seeking admission to courses like Sociology (Hons) or BSc in Computer Science, for which exams could not be conducted, will face no issue since they will be awarded marks in these subjects as well,” he said.Some principals, however, are of the opinion that the change in the evaluation process could lead to high cut-offs this year. Manoj Khanna, the principal of Ramjas College, said, “In DU, the admission process is CBSE-driven. Over 90% of applications come from CBSE students. There is a high probability that more students will score between 95% and 100% marks this year since their exams will be scored based on averages. Colleges will have to keep the cut-off high to avoid over-admission.”However, some teachers said students who usually focus on one particular subject could score less overall if the exam is not held. Pankaj Gupta, a faculty member at Rajdhani College and a former member of DU’s admission committee, said, “There is a possibility that some students were good in certain subjects for which exams could not be conducted and were preparing hard for them. In such cases, they might not be able to score much in other subjects. This will drop their total percentage, due to which they could miss a chance to get a seat in a DU college,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-admissions-won-t-be-affected-by-changes-in-cbse-s-evaluation-process-officials/story-4rNqD4BQDgQ3fV7Dt7vNuJ.html

Violation of norms will invite strict action against such establishments and these are liable to be closed again, he said.“It has been decided that malls will be allowed to open next week and they will have to follow the SOP issued on June 4. All norms pertaining to social distancing will have to be strictly followed,” said Singh, who was addressing a joint press conference with deputy commissioner Amit Khatri.However, officials did not specify a date when malls would reopen.Cinema halls, gaming arcades and children play areas shall remain closed inside the malls as per SOP, Singh said. Barring Faridabad and Gurugram, malls and religious places were allowed to open in Haryana June 8 onwards. Given the rising number of Covid 19 cases, the state government had on June 7 decided against opening shopping malls and religious places in these two districts. Restaurants and hotels across the state were also allowed to open, with some restrictions in place, across the state from June 8.Religious places in Gurugram shall remain closed till further orders, Singh said on Friday. He warned that shopping malls found flouting social distancing regulations and SOPs would be penalised, and the establishments shut.As per the Centre’s guidelines, visitors as well as staff at shopping malls must ensure distancing of six feet as far as possible, wear masks at all times, and wash hands frequently.Additionally, mall authorities must ensure hand sanitisers and provisions for thermal screening are made available at entrances. Malls have also been asked to ensure only those people who show no symptoms of Covid-19 are allowed entry, and they must wear masks throughout.The directions also said older employees, pregnant women, and those with underlying health conditions should be engaged in work from home “wherever feasible”.The SOP also reads that malls must follow the Central Public Work Department’s norms for air-conditioning and ventilation, and temperature and humidity should be kept above 24 degree Celsius and 40 to 70% respectively. Shopping malls operators welcomed the decision and said they had already prepared a detailed SOP to ensure the safety of visitors.Vijay Aima, vice president of Ambience Group which operates the Ambience Mall, said steps have been taken to ensure visitors are thermally screened, sanitiser dispensers have been installed and markings made to ensure social distancing. “Only those visitors who wear a mask and have temperature under the permissible limit will be allowed entry,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/malls-to-reopen-in-city-by-next-week-to-follow-strict-social-distancing-norms/story-iO6z4tXLh3oduUvZiaKGdP.html
27-06-2020||Noida||Residents troubled with stray dog menace, conflicts continue||Residents in the district say the administration was not taking any action despite complaints of stray dogs biting people.Residents of Prateek Wisteria in sector 77 had filed a complaint with the local police on June 24 after a person was bitten in the society’s basement. “In the last one year we have had at least 14 instances of dog bites and aggression. The problem is that no one is ready to take responsibility for stray dogs. There have been multiple complaints, but apart from sterilization nothing has been done. Residents are scared of going into the basement where many of them stay. A permanent solution needs to come for this problem before more such cases happen,” said Amit Gupta, president of the society’s apartment owners association (AOA).Residents allege that any time they object to animals’ presence, local people harassed them.“They rope in NGOs and start threatening us with legal action even though all we want is that public spaces where kids play or people walk remain safe. Basements become a special problem where these animals reside in large numbers. We must have at least 60 stray dogs in the society. A woman had recently complained that her Mercedes had been scratched by a dog. There needs to be a solution to this menace,” said Arun Sharma, president, AOA, Supertech Capetown.A local NGO said people need to be educated on how to handle such situations.“On June 10, a man had been arrested for assaulting a woman who was feeding the dogs in the Omicron 2 area. He even attacked a teenager who tried to intervene. These incidents show that people are not willing to co-exist,” said Kaveri Bhardwaj, president, People for Animals, an NGO working for animal welfare.She said that for most dogs, sterilisation helped rein in their aggression. In Gautam Budh Nagar, an organisation has been roped in by the Noida authority for sterilization.“We have been working for three years now and sterilisation helps with an aggressive dog. In case, the aggression continues we rehabilitate them at the animal shelter for 15-20 days and then they are taken back to their areas while we urge the local feeders to continue with the medication. The only solution to this problem is if both groups stop being adamant and come to amicable solutions,” said Rafat Ahmad, project manager, sterilisation unit, Noida authority.The animal shelter in sector 94 houses nearly 900 dogs while the stray dog population in the district hovers around 6000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/residents-troubled-with-stray-dog-menace-conflicts-continue/story-vIAy9ggryu2kkSFDnEtuzI.html

We at Bajaj Auto, like the country at large, are now learning to live with the virus. We will continue our normal business operations, while taking all necessary safety measures, as the alternative is to shut down our operations with ‘no work no pay’ which will have a drastic impact on our employees and supply chain.”The Bajaj statement came in clarification to media reports earlier in the day that 79 employees were found Covid-19 positive at the plant and the Aurangabad factory had to be shut down.Rajiv Bajaj, managing director or Bajaj Auto, trended on Twitter for most of Friday, following these media reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bajaj-auto-confirm-140-covid-cases-at-aurangabad-plant-since-june-6-factory-still-operational/story-DaWXNx33hoKrVilgGW8hUL.html

27-06-2020||Pune||Outside containment zones in Pune report more cases than inside limits||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) was the first civic body in the country to declare the entire city as a containment zone to check the spread of Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19 (coronavirus). The number of positive cases reported lately from micro containment zones is almost the same as from non-containment areas.The positive cases reported from city’s 73 micro containment zones is 45.9% and the rest are coming from outside containment limits, according to PMC health department.With more cases reported from outside containment zones, the civic administration is taking steps to bring down the numbers.The civic body in May announced its first list of containment zones which included restricting people movement in the three kilometres radius around the area where a positive case is reported and sealing not only the building where the resident is found positive.While the number of containment zones has gone up from 69 zones comprising 9.81 square kilometres as of May 3 to 73 zones comprising 6.64 sq kms as of June 17, the difference in cases between containment zones and non-containment zones has reduced.On May 3, when the zones were first declared almost 74.6% of Covid-19 cases were reported from containment zones and 25.3% from outside these zones with a difference of 49.3% in number of cases.On June 17, the difference in cases from containment zones and outside its limits reduced to 8.2% cases, with 45.9% cases reported from inside the zones and remaining 54.1% from outside containment limits.Shekhar Gaikwad, PMC commissioner said, “Containment areas are vibrant and so now we will review these zones not every 15 days as earlier but every Monday and Thursday. Many may get added during this exercise. The municipal commissioner has been given the discretionary powers to decide on whether to declare an entire society complex as a containment zone or just one particular building. The radius of the containment zones are definitely shrinking so as to avoid any inconvenience to someone who might have never come in contact with a positive person. We place barricades and other such blockages to avoid physical movement of residents which is only allowed for using toilet or for essential services.”Dr Abhijit More, who is working with Jan Aarogya Abhiyan, an NGO that works for public health, said, “The fact that more cases are coming up from outside restricted zones shows that more aggressive contact tracing and isolation of possible contacts is needed. By barricading a particular location, the civic body is only restricting the movement of those living in that place, but what about a person who might be living outside the zone but had come in contact a few days ago? He is also a potential carrier. At least 100 contacts could have been traced in the beginning which did not happen and so now even areas like Aundh and Kothrud which did not report any cases are reporting multiple cases rapidly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/outside-containment-zones-report-more-cases-than-inside-limits/story-DQBJiBL1raF3JWMyTEVuYK.html
27-06-2020||Pune||Chikhali residents protest against formation of isolation wards in housing society||The Gharkul society residents in Chikhali have again objected to the administration’s decision to set up Covid-19 isolation wards in their society.The residents had protested in March when Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) put up a quarantine facility in the residential zone.On Thursday, residents staged protest in front of their society.“PCMC constructed buildings under the low house scheme projects. Many are occupied and those vacant will be turned into isolation wards,” said Dr Pavan Salve, additional health and medical officer of PCMC.The civic administration okayed the option of home quarantine for residents with asymptomatic signs or mild fever after a surge in positive cases was reported last week.PCMC will turn four buildings in Gharkul Society — D5, D6, D7 and D8 — into isolation wards. There are 42 houses in one building and 168 units in total. Till June 26, 336 fans, 168 water geysers and 1,160 bulbs have been fitted in the isolation wards.“Why PCMC wants to set up isolation wards in our building. We have senior citizens as residents and all are worried about contracting the virus,” a Gharkul society resident said requesting anonymity. “Residents are concerned about virus spread, but we need centres to quarantine patients. All safety measures are in place,” said Salve.As of Friday, till 5:30 pm, PCMC has reported a total of 2,405 Covid-19 cases. Those cured are 1,443 and 919 are undergoing treatment. The virus has claimed 41 residents in PCMC.On June 9, residents of Anandnagar in Chinchwad staged protest against containment restrictions and damaged police vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chikhali-residents-protest-against-formation-of-isolation-wards-in-housing-society/story-lvsbq9eEonOppwI6vNAJdN.html

It has also decided to put on hold the scheme to travel in peth areas for Rs10.Hemant Rasane, PMC standing committee chairperson and PMPML director, said, “PMPML has 9,000 employees on roll and 2,000 on contract. The utility is unable to pay staff salaries for the past two months because of poor business due to the Covid-19 situation. Our top priority is to pay salaries of employees even as bus operations is severely affected and income generation is poor. There is a limit to Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporations to bear the losses. Hence, we have decided to stop the purchase of new 350 buses.”The director said that the transport utility is facing loses because of less commuters. “Though the Centre has agreed to help fund the purchase of e-buses, it is better to put the proposal on hold though the tendering process is almost in its last stage,” Rasane said.PMPML chairperson and managing director Nayana Gunde confirmed that the new bus purchase plan is on hold.Rasne said, “The Rs10 scheme was announced in the 2020-21 PMC budget. People can travel in any part of the central city by paying Rs10. We have decided to postpone the scheme. Instead of hiring buses for executing the scheme, it is our plan to launch it after purchasing medi-buses.”Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “The public transport utility is facing financial crisis due to the Covid-19 situation. We are taking steps to pay the salaries of employees and the proposal to buy new buses is on hold.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmpml-postpones-bus-purchase-rs10-travel-anywhere-plans/story-ei7zPnjqv6bDaynymrZn0O.html
27-06-2020||World||US sees record Covid-19 cases in a day, officials regret reopening move||The United Sates set another single-day day record for new Covid-19 infections with 45,255 cases reported on Friday as public health officials blamed the new surge on states that opened too soon or without necessary precautions and younger people returning to public life.Anthony Fauci, the top epidemiologist, has called the changed focus of the epidemic on to younger people a “paradigm shift”. They are “going to be asymptomatic, and people who are getting infected in a community setting, not an outbreak setting where you know who to identify, isolate and contact trace”, he said at the first briefing of the White House coronavirus task force in two months on Friday.The states worst affected by the surge are reviving restrictions that they had rushed to lift earlier, against the advise to public health. Texas, for instance, which saw another day of more than 5,000 new infections, has shut down bars and restaurants and certain outdoor activities.State’s governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, sounded contrite in an interview to a local TV station:“If I could go back and redo anything, it probably would have been to slow down the opening of bars, now seeing the aftermath of how quickly the coronavirus spreads in the bar setting.”Florida, another state in the eye of the new surge with a daily record of close to 9,000 news infections on Friday, has also brought back some restrictions. Bars are prohibited from serving alcohol now, its Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, a close ally of President Donald Trump, has resisted calls to do more.Different counties, however, are taking their own measures. Miami-Dade county has shut down beaches and public parks in view of the upcoming July 4 independence day weekend, and another county is mailing reusable masks to all its residents.The states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, that were the hardest hit earlier, are continuing their reopening. Connecticut has become the first state to announce plans to resume in-school education in the fall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sees-record-covid-19-cases-in-a-day-officials-regret-reopening-move/story-h9OQCT4rWjVlyzLnO8oHFL.html
27-06-2020||World||Ireland gets coalition government, Leo Varadkar to return as PM in 2022||Leo Varadkar, the outgoing prime minister of Ireland, will now be the deputy prime minister under a new coalition government from Saturday headed by Micheal Martin, and return as the prime minister in 2022 under the power-sharing arrangement.Varadkar, 41, became a caretaker prime minister after no party won a majority in the February 8 election. The process of government formation was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Three parties have now agreed to form the coalition government.They are Varadkar’s Fine Gael party, Martin’s Fianna Fail (both centrist) and the Green party. Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, who have long been rivals since the Irish Civil War, are joining a coalition for the first time.Martin will be the prime minister (Taoiseach) for two and a half years, and will be replaced by Varadkar for the remaining period of the parliament from December 2022, reports from Dublin said.In London, Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: “Congratulations to Ireland on forming a new Government and to Micheal MartinTD on becoming Taoiseach”. “Ireland is our closest neighbour, good friend and ally on issues such as climate change, the global fight against Covid-19 and our shared values on human rights and democracy.”Under the coalition agreement, the new government will implement the Green party’s demand to set a target of 7 per cent to cut carbon emissions every year.Green party leader Eamon Ryan said: “There’s a sense of responsibility on us now because we do have a job to do. We have to go in and help work with our coalition partners in government in actually getting our country out of a really severe economic crisis”.“People at home who are losing their jobs or maybe risk of that, they want a government to get up and stand up for them and get everyone back working.”With a base in both Ireland and Northern Ireland (part of UK), Sinn Fein emerged as a major factor in the election, exploiting ennui in the country wracked by rising housing costs and the people not experiencing economic recovery in recent years, but is not part of the coalition.Sinn Fein was known as the political wing of the Irish Republican Army that was responsible for violence and terrorism for years in Northern Ireland and elsewhere, until peace returned with the Good Friday agreement of 1998.Sinn Fein seeks reunification of the island of Ireland, promising a referendum within five years. Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have the same objective in the long-term, but do not favour the referendum soon enough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ireland-gets-coalition-government-leo-varadkar-to-return-as-pm-in-2022/story-j8zlpeJxG3Fa1KIWTnTXlN.html
27-06-2020||World||US slaps visa restrictions on Chinese officials over Hong Kong autonomy||The United States on Friday announced visa restrictions on current and former officials of the Chinese Communist Party, and their families, deemed responsible for undermining Honk Kong’s “high degree of autonomy” guaranteed by a Sino-British pact joint declaration from 1984.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cited a proposed move by Beijing to “supervise” policing in Hong Kong under a new national security law and also intervene directly in some areas as the immediate provocation for the visa curbs. China’s parliament is expected to adopt the new law next week.Precise details of the law remain secret. But it is expected to make it a criminal offence to secede, subvert, support terrorism and collude with foreign governments, the BBC has reported in an explainer. Among other things, Beijing will have the authority to interpret the law when needed, not any local authority.Hong Kong enjoys freedoms and rights not extended to mainland Chinese, under the 1984 joint declaration that paved the way for the 1997 transfer of Hong Kong by the British, who had administered it since conquering it in 1840 after the Opium War. It’s a legally binding agreement under which China’s basic policies regarding China will remain unchanged for 50 years, and it included, among other things, that guarantee of a “high degree of autonomy”“The United States calls on China to honor its commitments and obligations in the Sino-British Joint Declaration – namely that Hong Kong will “enjoy a high degree of autonomy” and that human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly, will be protected by law and respected by governing authorities in Hong Kong.,” Pompeo said in the announcement. “The United States will continue to review its authorities to respond to these concerns,’ he added.Tensions and rhetoric the United States and China have risen dramatically in the aftermath of the Covid-19 epidemic. The Trump administration has accused China of misleading the world about the disease and concealing its mistake and the exact magnitude of the epidemic. Negative views about China have shot up in polls of Americans and a spate of legislations are making their way through congress against China.Trump signed one of them into law last week that seeks to punish China with sanctions over its treatment of Uighur Muslims.The Chinese embassy in Washington denounced the visa restrictions as interference. “We urge the US side to immediately correct its mistakes, withdraw the decisions and stop interfering in China’s domestic affairs. The Chinese side will continue to take strong measures to uphold national sovereignty, security and development interests, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-slaps-visa-restrictions-on-chinese-officials-over-hong-kong-autonomy/story-fswZM9a5aadhnNb8Mo08jO.html
27-06-2020||World||Satellite image: Iran blast struck by suspected missile site||An explosion that rattled Iran’s capital came from an area in its eastern mountains that analysts believe hides an underground tunnel system and missile production sites, satellite photographs showed Saturday.What exploded in the incident early Friday that sent a massive fireball into the sky near Tehran remains unclear, as does the cause of the blast.The unusual response of the Iranian government in the aftermath of the explosion, however, underscores the sensitive nature of an area near where international inspectors believe the Islamic Republic conducted high-explosive tests two decades ago for nuclear weapon triggers.The blast shook homes, rattled windows and lit up the horizon early Friday in the Alborz Mountains. State TV later aired a segment from what it described as the site of the blast.One of its journalists stood in front of what appeared to be large, blackened gas cylinders, though the camera remained tightly focused and did not show anything else around the site. Defense Ministry spokesman Davood Abdi blamed the blast on a leaking gas he did not identify and said no one was killed in the explosion.Abdi described the site as a “public area,” raising the question of why military officials and not civilian firefighters would be in charge. The state TV report did not answer that.Satellite photos of the area, some 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) east of downtown Tehran, showed hundreds of meters (yards) of charred scrubland not seen in images of the area taken in the weeks ahead of the incident. The building near the char marks resembled the facility seen in the state TV footage.The gas storage area sits near what analysts describe as Iran’s Khojir missile facility. The explosion appears to have struck a facility for the Shahid Bakeri Industrial Group, which makes solid-propellant rockets, said Fabian Hinz, a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California.The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies identified Khojir as the “site of numerous tunnels, some suspected of use for arms assembly.” Large industrial buildings at the site visible from satellite photographs also suggest missile assembly being conducted there.The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency says Iran overall has the largest underground facility program in the Middle East.Such sites “support most facets of Tehran’s ballistic missile capabilities, including the operational force and the missile development and production program,” the DIA said in 2019.Iranian officials themselves also identified the site as being in Parchin, home to a military base where the International Atomic Energy Agency previously said it suspects Iran conducted tests of explosive triggers that could be used in nuclear weapons. Iran long has denied seeking nuclear weapons, though the IAEA previously said Iran had done work in “support of a possible military dimension to its nuclear program” that largely halted in late 2003.Western concerns over the Iranian atomic program led to sanctions and eventually to Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. The U.S. under President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord in May 2018, leading to a series of escalating attacks between Iran and the U.S. and Tehran abandoning the deal’s production limits.Iran’s missile and space programs have suffered a series of explosions in recent years. The most notable came in 2011, when a blast at a missile base near Tehran killed Revolutionary Guard commander Hassan Tehrani Moghaddam, who led the paramilitary force’s missile program, and 16 others. Initially, authorities described the blast as an accident, though a former prisoner later said the Guard interrogated him on suspicion Israel caused the explosion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/satellite-image-iran-blast-struck-by-suspected-missile-site/story-1tDJIwklngTJ44HTx8CSoO.html
27-06-2020||World||Why Americans are having an emotional reaction to masks||While Americans still have not adopted mask-wearing as a general norm, we’re wearing masks more than ever before. Mask-wearing is mandated in California, and in many counties masks are near-universal in public spaces. So I have started wondering: Does wearing a mask change our social behavior and our emotional inclinations? And if mask-wearing does indeed change the fabric of our interactions, is that one reason why the masks are not more popular in the U.S.?When no one can see our countenances, we may behave differently. One study found that children wearing Halloween masks were more likely to break the rules and take more candy. The anonymity conferred by masks may be making it easier for protestors to knock down so many statues.And indeed, people have long used masks to achieve a kind of plausible deniability. At Carnival festivities around the world people wear masks, and this seems to encourage greater revelry, drunkenness, and lewd behavior, traits also associated with masked balls. The mask creates another persona. You can act a little more outrageously, knowing that your town or village, a few days later, will regard that as “a different you.”If we look to popular culture, mask-wearing is again associated with a kind of transgression. Batman, Robin and the Lone Ranger wear masks, not just to keep their true identities a secret, but to enable their “ordinary selves” to step into these larger-than-life roles.But if we examine mask-wearing in the context of Covid-19, a different picture emerges. The mask is now a symbol of a particular kind of conformity, and a ritual of collective responsibility and discipline against the virus. The masks themselves might encourage this norm adherence by boosting the sense of group membership among the wearers.The public health benefits of mask-wearing far exceed the social costs, but still if we want mask-wearing to be a stable norm we may need to protect against or at least recognize some of its secondary consequences, including the disorientations that masks can produce. Because mask-wearing norms seem weakest in many of the most open societies, such as the United States and United Kingdom, perhaps it is time to come to terms how masks rewrite how we react and respond to each other.If nothing else, our smiles cannot be seen under our masks, and that makes social interactions feel more hostile and alienating, and it may lower immediate levels of trust in casual interactions. There are plenty of negative, hostile claims about masks circulating, to the point of seeming crazy, but rather than just mocking them perhaps we need to recognize what has long been called “the paranoid style in American politics.” If we admit that mask-wearing has a psychologically strange side, we might do better than simply to lecture the miscreants about their failings.Just ask yourself a simple question: If someone tells you there is a new movie or TV show out, and everyone in the drama is wearing masks, do you tend to think that’s a feel-good romantic comedy, or a scary movie? In essence, we are asking Americans to live in that scenario, but not quite giving them the psychological armor to do so successfully.On the brighter side, I wonder if mask-wearing might diminish some expressions of intolerance. People who might feel that others are “looking at them funny” might find themselves with less to be offended by as masks obscure those micro-reactions. Common mask-wearing is already reportedly easing the public judgment experienced by Muslim women who wear face coverings in Western society; some Muslim women who wear the niqab report that they are no longer being given dirty looks, if only because they no longer stick out so much.Women who cover their faces for religious reasons may now be ahead of the rest of us when it comes to effective communication — because they cannot rely as much their faces to convey emotion in public conversations, they report relying on more visible body language like waving and gesturing.The tension of current mask policy is that it reflects a desire for a more obedient, ordered society, for public health purposes above all, but at the same time it creates incentives and inclinations for non-conformity. That is true at least within the context of American culture, admittedly an outlier, both for its paranoia and for its infatuation with popular culture. As a society, our public mask-wearing is thus at war with its own emotional leanings, because it is packaging together a message based on both discipline and deviance.What can we do to convince people that a mask-laden society, while it will feel weird and indeed be weird, can be made stable and beneficial through our own self-awareness? While there is no simple answer to that question, mask advocates should recognize that they have been treading into unusual cultural territory, and should not be surprised by unusual public responses.(This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

27-06-2020||World||Covid-19: Indians in UK most dead among non-whites||Coronavirus patients of Indian origin top the list of patients who have succumbed to the virus among the non-white population in England, according to latest figures released by the National Health Service, as the UK prepares to ease lockdown further from July 4.NHS England figures show that 763 patients categorised as ‘Indian’ died as of June 25, followed by patients of ‘Caribbean’ heritage (636) and of ‘Pakistani’ origin (479). The ‘Indian’ category accounts for 3 per cent among the non-white patients who died due to contracting the virus.Together, the non-white patients categorised as BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) accounted for 3,794 deaths. Several reviews have concluded that the virus has affected the BAME communities ‘disproportionately’.Besides higher incidence of diseases such as diabetes among BAME communities, the reviews highlight the fact that individuals from such communities make up a large share of jobs considered essential in tackling the virus, many of which are public-facing. Several doctors and nurses of Indian heritage working in the NHS are among the dead. A report by Public Health England said: “Historic racism and poorer experiences of healthcare or at work may mean that individuals in BAME groups are less likely to seek care when needed or as NHS staff are less likely to speak up when they have concerns about Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) or risk.”Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) have showed that there is a “significantly higher” risk of death from the virus among Indian and other non-white communities than the white community.The ONS said Indian and other non-white males are 4.2 times more likely to die from a Covid-19-related death and non-white females are 4.3 times more likely than white ethnicity males and females. The UK’s Indian-origin population is estimated to number 1.5 million.The ONS said: “People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani, Indian, and Mixed ethnicities also had statistically significant raised risk of death involving Covid-19 compared with those of White ethnicity”.According to Kamlesh Khunti, medical expert at the University of Leicester, the reasons Indian and other non-white people figure more in the statistics, despite accounting for only 14 per cent of the UK population, include many coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, working in public-facing occupations, holding different cultural beliefs and behaviours or being at high risk of diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-indians-in-uk-most-dead-among-non-whites/story-9VnyMIzeWOTJFS2lBcAj0O.html
27-06-2020||World||US states reimpose virus controls; India tops 500,000 cases||Reversing course, two of America’s largest states reinstated some coronavirus restrictions in the nation’s biggest retreat yet, as the daily number of confirmed infections in the U.S. surged to an all-time high of 45,300.India reported more than 18,000 new cases Saturday, pushing its cumulative total over the half-million mark, the fourth highest globally behind the U.S., Brazil and Russia. Elsewhere, Egypt and Britain said they would ease virus controls, while China and South Korea battled smaller outbreaks in their capitals.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered all bars closed, and Florida banned alcohol at such establishments. They joined a small but growing number of states that are either backtracking or putting any further reopening of their economies on hold because of a comeback by the virus, mostly in the country’s South and West.Health experts have said a disturbingly large number of cases are being seen among young people who are going out again, often without wearing masks or observing other social-distancing rules.“It is clear that the rise in cases is largely driven by certain types of activities, including Texans congregating in bars,” Abbott said.The Republican governor, who had pursued one of the most aggressive reopening schedules of any state, also scaled back restaurant capacity and said outdoor gatherings of more than 100 people would need approval from local officials.Mayor Carlos Gimenez in Florida’s Miami-Dade County announced Friday night that he would close beaches over the Fourth of July weekend. He said cracking down on recreational activities is prudent given the growing number of infections among young adults.Stocks fell sharply on Wall Street on Friday over the surging case numbers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 730 points, or nearly 3%.The Indian city of Gauhati, the capital of Assam state, will be locked down for two weeks starting Monday, with night curfews and weekend lockdowns in the rest of the state. India added 18,552 cases in the past 24 hours, raising its total to 508,953. The death toll reached 15,685.China saw an uptick in cases, one day after authorities said they expect an outbreak in Beijing to be brought under control in the near future. The National Health Commission reported 17 new cases in the nation’s capital, the most in a week, among 21 nationwide.South Korea, where a resurgence in the past month threatens to erase the country’s earlier success, reported 51 new cases, including 35 in the Seoul metropolitan area. Officials, worried about the fragile economy, have resisted calls to reimpose restrictions eased in April.Cairo’s cafes welcomed back in-house customers Saturday as Egypt reopened cafes, clubs, gyms and theaters after more than three months of closures. Wearing face masks, the faithful poured into mosques for dawn prayers, though mosques and churches are not yet allowed to hold their main weekly services.Britain was expected to scrap a 14-day quarantine requirement for people returning from abroad in a bid to make summer vacation travel possible. Only travelers from “red’’ zones, places with a high level of COVID-19, will be told to self-isolate. A full list of countries, due to be published next week, is likely to give Spain, Greece and France a green light.Australia braced for more imported cases as citizens return home. About 300 people were due to arrive this weekend from Mumbai, India, with others expected to follow from South America and Indonesia. One state heath official said he is preparing for 5% to 10% of the returnees to be infected, based on arrivals from Indonesia in other states.In Florida, the agency that regulates bars acted after the daily number of new confirmed cases neared 9,000, almost doubling the record set just two days earlier.Colleen Corbett, a 30-year-old bartender at two places in Tampa, said that she was disappointed and worried about being unemployed again, but that the restrictions are the right move. Most customers were not wearing masks, she said.“It was like they forgot there was a pandemic or just stopped caring,” Corbett said.A number of the hardest-hit states, including Florida and Arizona, have Republican governors who have resisted mask-wearing requirements and largely echoed President Donald Trump’s desire to reopen the economy quickly despite warnings that the virus could come storming back.The White House coronavirus task force, led by Vice President Mike Pence, held its first briefing in nearly two months Friday, and Pence gave assurances that the U.S. is “in a much better place” than it was two months ago.He said the country has more medical supplies on hand, a smaller share of patients are being hospitalized, and deaths are much lower than they were in the spring.The count of new confirmed infections, provided by Johns Hopkins University, eclipsed the previous high of 40,000 set the previous day. Newly reported cases per day have risen on average about 60% over the past two weeks, according to an Associated Press analysis.While the rise partly reflects expanded testing, experts say there is ample evidence the scourge is making a comeback, including rising deaths and hospitalizations in parts of the country and higher percentages of virus tests coming back positive.About 600 people are dying every day from the coronavirus in the U.S., down from a peak of around 2,200 in mid-April. Some experts doubt that deaths will return to that level, because of advances in treatment and prevention and because younger adults are more likely than older ones to survive.The virus is blamed for about 125,000 deaths and nearly 2.5 million confirmed infections nationwide, by Johns Hopkins’ count. But health officials believe the true number of infections is about 10 times higher. Worldwide, the virus has claimed close to a half-million lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-states-reimpose-virus-controls-india-tops-500-000-cases/story-Ha3e64KZPMjic5EHThEJyL.html
27-06-2020||World||Hong Kong police refuse permission for march to mark handover||The Hong Kong police department on Saturday denied permission for an annual march in the former British colony on July 1 to mark the anniversary of the city’s 1997 return to China, the organiser and the police said in separate statements.In a notice to the organiser, Civil Human Rights Front, the police cited the city’s current rules limiting gatherings to no more than 50 people due to the coronavirus pandemic, saying public assemblies and demonstrations are not exempted.The notice, posted on the front’s Facebook page, also cited violent incidents that took place after public assemblies and rallies organised by the group over the past 12 months.“Upon risk assessment, police considered that the public meetings and procession are high-risk activities,” the local police department said in a separate post on the department’s Facebook page. The move comes ahead of a three-day meeting from Sunday of China’s parliament, which is expected to enact new national security legislation on the eve of the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule.China says the national security law, which has alarmed foreign governments and democracy activists, will target only a small group of troublemakers and people who abide by the legislation have no reason to worry.China took back control of Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including freedom of protest and a much-cherished independent judiciary.In recent years, the anniversary of the handover has been marked by deepening despondency about what many residents saw as increasing meddling by the mainland and the erosion of freedoms.On Friday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington was imposing visa restrictions on Chinese officials responsible for restricting freedoms in Hong Kong, but he did not name any of those targeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-police-refuse-permission-for-march-to-mark-handover/story-SMXIeWLQNOEnEuo6IdVKWK.html

China currently can offer 3.78 million nucleic acid tests for Covid-19 every day, a 200-percent increase from March, a health official said earlier this week.As of June 22, Chinese medical institutions had conducted 90.41 million nucleic acid tests for COVID-19 in total, said Guo Yanhong, an official with the NHC said.The total number of designated centers offering nucleic acid tests has increased from 2,081 in early March to the current 4,804, marking a 131-percent increase, Guo said, adding that 28,500 technicians are carrying out nucleic acid testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-issues-new-covid-19-guidelines-as-fresh-cases-inch-close-to-300/story-bkTKxKReyb8DsGTGFwR6KN.html
27-06-2020||World||Individuals have societal responsibility to end Covid-19 outbreak: Anthony Fauci||America’s top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci has said that individuals have a societal responsibility to end the coronavirus outbreak as the US set another single-day record, surpassing 40,000 Covid-19 cases for the first time. Fauci, during the first White House Coronavirus Task Force press conference in months, said that there’s no other infectious disease that goes from 40 per cent of the people having no symptoms to some having mild symptoms to some having severe, some requiring staying at home for weeks, some going to the hospital, some getting intensive care, some getting intubated, some getting ventilated and some dying. “I just want to bring this out without making it seem that anybody is at fault, you have an individual responsibility to yourself but you have a societal responsibility because if we want to end this outbreak, really end it and then hopefully when a vaccine comes and puts the nail in the coffin, we’ve got to realise that we are part of the process,” he said on Friday. Fauci, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said that “depending on where you are in that spectrum, you have a different attitude to this particular thing”. But anyone who gets infected or is at risk of getting infected to a greater or lesser degree is part of the dynamic process of the outbreak, he said. “I was at a stage in my life when I said well, I’m invulnerable, so I’m going to take a risk. I think what we are missing in this is something that we’ve never faced before is that a risk for you is not just isolated to you because if you get infected, you are part, innocently or inadvertently of propagating the dynamic process of a pandemic. “Because the chances are that if you get infected that you’re going to infect someone else. And although you may feel well and because we know if you look at the numbers that you’ll probably hear later on, the overwhelming majority now of people getting infected are young people, likely the people that you see in the clips and in the paper who are out in crowds enjoying themselves, understandably,” Fauci said. The reproduction element of the virus is not less than one, he said. “So people are infecting other people. And then ultimately, you will infect someone who’s vulnerable. Now, that may be somebody’s grandmother, grandfather, uncle who’s on chemotherapy and who’s on radiation or chemotherapy or a child who has leukemia,” the top American doctor said. According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the contagion has infected over 9.8 million people and killed more than 494,000 across the world. The US is the worst affected country with over 2.46 million cases and more than 1,25,000 deaths. The Covid-19, which originated in China’s Wuhan city in December last year, has also battered the world economy with the International Monetary Fund saying that the global economy is bound to suffer a “severe recession”. Scientists are racing against time to find a vaccine or medicine for its treatment. According to Vice President Mike Pence, more than 2,500,000 Americans have contracted the coronavirus and over 126,000 have died. All the 50 states and territories across this country are opening up safely and responsibly, but with the cases rising particularly over the past week, Trump directed the task force to brief the Americans. On Friday a record number of 40,000 new cases were reported. “Despite those losses since the end of our 45 days to slow the spread and the beginning of efforts to open up America thanks to the cooperation of the American people, the efforts of governors and state health officials, efforts I want to proudly say of the entire federal team under the leadership of President Trump, we have made truly remarkable progress in moving our nation forward,” Pence said.As the country opens up, more than three million jobs were created in the last job report, he said.“Retail sales are rolling and, of course, the extraordinary progress in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and New Orleans, areas that just a matter of a month ago were struggling under the weight of this pandemic and that now have arrived at a very, very different place,” Pence added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/individuals-have-societal-responsibility-to-end-covid-19-outbreak-anthony-fauci/story-BPxpKn23GtF1bHPEKxJfEI.html

Police also recovered about 40,000 drug pills and locally made guns, he said.According to authorities and local media reports, the gang led by Abdul Hakim has kidnapped many locals for ransom and killed those whose families failed to pay. It had allegedly abducted at least seven Bangladeshis over the last two months and killed three hostages. Hakim remains at large.While human rights groups acknowledge there are criminal elements among some of the Rohingya refugees, they have urged authorities to thoroughly investigate such cases.In March, police fatally shot seven suspected members of a Rohingya gang allegedly involved in drug dealing and human trafficking.More than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Myanmar into Bangladesh after the Buddhist-majority country’s military launched a crackdown against them in August 2017 in response to an attack by insurgents.(AP) RUP RUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-rohingya-men-killed-in-gunfight-with-bangladesh-police/story-a2Qhl0fUWWHVMQiR3Q7d0J.html

His close relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi – reflected in the two leaders jointly addressing massive public rallies in Houston and Ahmedabad – has helped him make deep inroads among the Indian-Americans.“He (Trump) recognises the vital role Indian-Americans play in bolstering our economy, enriching our culture, and strengthening our communities,” she said.During his first two years in office, President Trump led the US to its greatest economic comeback in history.“And the unemployment rate among Indian-Americans dropped by nearly 33 per cent,” Matthews said.The President continues to fight for the prosperity, health, and freedom of all Americans, including the flourishing and hardworking Indian-American community, she said, responding to a question related to the increasing popularity of Trump among the community.Al Mason said while the vision of Trump is the driving force in this unprecedented outreach with the Indian-Americans and a new peak in ties with India, the entire family including the First Lady Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, who have recently visited India with him, shown their immense respect and love for the country.Not to overlook son Donald Trump Jr and Kimberly Guilfoyle, senior advisor to Donald Trump for President, Inc. and national chair of the Trump Victory Finance Committee, Mason said.Former TV host-cum-attorney Guilfoyle is now considered as one of the most powerful individuals in the Trump campaign. Both Trump Jr and Guilfoyle have time and again echoed Trump’s love for India and Indian-Americans which is reflected in their remarks at various Indian-American events in New York.“Want to see America work with incredible allies like India to make the world a safer place,” Don Jr said last year.“America embodies family values, values of hardworking people, strong work ethic, entrepreneurial spirit and these values are “shared magnificently with India as well,” said Guilfoyle, who believes that Indian-Americans are a crucial ally for the campaign.“I think we’re so lucky as a country to have so many talented, dedicated, patriotic Indian-Americans making up the incredibly diverse fabric culturally of this country and we’re lucky that they have called it their home,” Guilfoyle, who has helped initiate the process, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-grateful-for-indian-americans-support-white-house/story-XCXEp00a31UpyQ09Fr5hsO.html
27-06-2020||World||‘Immune cells involved in protection against Covid-19 identified’: Study||Patients suffering from severe respiratory symptoms due to the novel coronavirus infection can rapidly generate an immune response in the form of virus-attacking T cells, suggests a new study which may lead to new vaccine development strategies against Covid-19. The study, published in the journal Science Immunology, assessed T cells from 10 Covid-19 patients under intensive care treatment.  According to the researchers, including those from the University of California in the US, two out of 10 healthy individuals without prior exposure to the virus also harbored SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells. Based on this observation, they said these T cells may be cross-reacting to the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, due to past infection with related coronaviruses that cause common cold symptoms. The findings, according to the researchers, address the poorly understood question of whether SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses vary in patients over time depending on disease severity. They said the study may help understand whether patients with more severe symptoms can generate protective virus-specific T cells at all, and offer clues regarding the cells responsible for excessive immune responses which has led to the deaths of many Covid-19 patients. In the research, scientists, including Daniela Weiskopf from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in the US, extracted blood cells from 10 patients at weekly intervals starting soon after they were admitted to the ICU for Covid-19. They exposed these cells to “megapools” of known SARS-CoV-2 protein components in a technique meant to capture a large fraction of total viral-reactive T cells. The researchers found that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ helper T cells were active in all 10 patients, and CD8+ “killer” T cells were present in 8 out of 10 patients. They also characterised the cells’ production of specific inflammation-triggering cell-cell signalling molecules called cytokines. According to the scientists, the strongest responses were directed to the virus’ spike (S) surface protein, supporting prior work that has pointed to this protein as a promising target to induce virus-specific T cells. On screening all patients at 0, 7, and 14 days after inclusion in the study revealed that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were present relatively early during the course of infection, and increased in these patients over time. Using the same T cell stimulation technique in age-matched healthy controls, the researchers found SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in 2 out of the 10 individuals. They believe a future study of how preexisting SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in healthy controls correlate to protection against Covid-19 can help shed more light on the disease and “and also inform vaccine design and evaluation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/immune-cells-involved-in-protection-against-covid-19-identified-study/story-HS9ptE8JKts531KXgwNWQP.html
27-06-2020||World||German state bank faces $112 million of losses from Wirecard||Germany’s state-owned development bank KfW is facing potential losses of 100 million euros ($112 million) after payment company Wirecard AG filed for insolvency Thursday.KfW’s subsidiary Ipex Bank granted the scandal-hit company a 100 million-euro credit line in September 2018. The financing was extended last year and has been fully drawn down, a spokesman for Ipex told Bloomberg in an email. There are no hedges to protect the lender from any losses, he added.Other banks are on the hook for about 1.6 billion euros in loans, people familiar with the matter have said. A group of more than a dozen lenders led by ABN Amro Bank NV, Commerzbank AG and ING Groep NV were in negotiations with Wirecard aimed at keeping it afloat and were surprised by the insolvency filing, Bloomberg has reported.Wirecard was once lauded as one of Germany’s most successful up-and-coming businesses. The company’s unraveling quickened earlier this week when it said that 1.9 billion euros previously reported as cash on its balance sheet probably doesn’t exist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-state-bank-faces-112-million-of-losses-from-wirecard/story-Q9GZ1KZ1ABsubfF4kNlwvL.html
27-06-2020||World||Second-generation Covid-19 vaccines are built for impact over speed||Speed isn’t the only thing that matters in the quest for a vaccine to end the Covid-19 pandemic.They may not cross the finish line first, but dozens of companies and universities still see an opening for inoculations that prevent more infections, provide lasting immunity, protect older and more vulnerable people, yield massive quantities or ship easily throughout the world. Those are benefits the front-runners may not be able to deliver.“Is it the tortoise or the hare?” said Seth Berkley, chief executive officer of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a global non-profit focused on access to immunizations. “There may be a vaccine we start using that isn’t ideal, and we move to a different one later.”Some of the world’s most prolific and experienced vaccine developers -- Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Merck & Co. -- are among at least 100 challengers trailing the leaders. While they haven’t begun testing their experimental shots in humans, the companies are emerging as formidable contenders in the race to halt a disease that has infected about 10 million people globally, killing half a million.“At this stage everything is still on the table,” said Charlie Weller, the head of vaccines at Wellcome, the U.K.-based health research foundation. “There are so many challenges that some candidates could drop out. Therefore we need multiple approaches.”More than one supplier will probably be needed to make the billions of doses that will required. And some populations may not respond to an initial vaccine, according to Michael Kinch, a drug development expert and associate vice chancellor at Washington University in St. Louis.“We may end up creating different classes of society, where you have to stay home and you can go out,” Kinch said. “We haven’t even begun to put our arms and brains around what that would mean.”More than a dozen potential Covid vaccines, including programs led by the University of Oxford and partner AstraZeneca Plc, Moderna Inc., Pfizer Inc. and China’s CanSino Biologics Inc., have started human trials over the past few months. They’re seeking to develop a vaccine in record time, in some cases aiming to provide the initial doses as early as this year.A few of the leaders, including Moderna, are betting on novel RNA-based platforms that prompt the body’s own cells to make proteins that provoke the immune system to react as if it’s been invaded by a pathogen, training it to defend against the real thing. While these vaccines are quick to make, none such product has yet been licensed for people, and it still isn’t clear whether the first Covid vaccines will protect against infection.A recent upturn in U.S. cases underscores the need for a reliable weapon to combat Covid-19. Some vaccines advancing at a slower pace are based on tried-and-true methods, like those containing a weakened form of the virus, Gavi’s Berkley said in an interview. Those could be effective in single doses or have other features that make them easier to use.“You could have a situation where some of the more conventional vaccines, if they provide robust immunity, may be particularly attractive,” he said.One example is a Merck shot based on an approach that was highly effective in single doses against Ebola and became the first approved inoculation for the virus last year. Expected to enter human tests later this year, the coronavirus version could be part of a longer-term solution.Merck wants a vaccine “to deal not just with the pandemic, but the endemic phase” if, like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 becomes established in the human population, CEO Ken Frazier said in an interview.A couple of months behind Oxford in getting to human tests, Imperial College London is focusing on RNA technology, but with a “self-amplifying” feature aimed at inducing immunity with a much smaller dose.“I don’t see the first vaccine to be proven to work as the vaccine that necessarily will be the one that’s used most widely,” said Robin Shattock, a professor at Imperial who’s leading development of a shot. He said he hopes to begin a larger study in October.Rather than developing its own candidate, the U.K. pharmaceutical giant Glaxo is contributing adjuvants -- substances that enhance the body’s immune response -- to a collaboration with Sanofi and others. That would decrease the amount of vaccine each person needs for immunization, and extend supplies. Sanofi expects to start a study compressing the early and middle stages of clinical trials in September.The technology could play a key role in protecting the elderly, who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19, according to Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of Glaxo’s vaccines unit. Another huge drug company in the second wave of vaccines, Johnson & Johnson, said this month that it will start human trials in the last half of July, about two months earlier than expected.The company’s goal is to “protect people everywhere from this pandemic,” said Paul Stoffels, J&J’s chief scientific officer.A successful shot may not accomplish everything that’s needed to conquer the virus, Wellcome’s Weller said, and having a number of vaccines would help immunize a broader swath of people. Rolling out vaccines in hot and remote regions could be complex if they require cold-storage supply chains or multiple doses, she said.With the candidates out front “some will fail, and maybe one or two will succeed,” said Breuer, the Glaxo vaccine executive. “We shouldn’t assume the fastest is always the best in terms of longer-term value.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/second-generation-covid-19-vaccines-are-built-for-impact-over-speed/story-0RLrtoCta8BMptjjJJIp6I.html
27-06-2020||World||Judge orders Trump adviser Roger Stone to report to prison by July 14||A federal judge on Friday ordered Roger Stone, President Donald Trump’s longtime friend and adviser, to report to prison by July 14 to begin his sentence after being convicted of seven criminal counts last year, granting him a 14-day extension over concerns about the coronavirus.The 67-year-old veteran Republican operative and self-described “dirty trickster,” who lives in South Florida, had been scheduled to report to a federal prison in Jesup, Georgia, by next Tuesday. Florida is experiencing rising numbers of coronavirus infections.Stone was found guilty by a jury last November of obstruction, witness tampering and lying to Congress under oath during its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who in February sentenced him to three years and four months in prison, granted the extension sought by Stone and ordered him placed in home confinement.“This will address the defendant’s stated medical concerns during the current increase of reported cases in Florida, and Broward County in particular, and it will respect and protect the health of other inmates who share defendant’s anxiety over the potential introduction and spread of the virus at this now-unaffected facility,” Berman said.Trump, who has argued that Stone was treated unfairly, declined to answer directly when asked in a Fox News Channel interview on Thursday whether he would issue him a pardon.Stone was one of several Trump associates who were convicted or pleaded guilty to charges stemming from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation that detailed Russian meddling in the 2016 election to boost Trump’s candidacy.He was convicted of lying to the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee about his attempts to contact WikiLeaks, the website that released damaging emails about Trump’s 2016 Democratic election rival Hillary Clinton that US intelligence officials have concluded were stolen by Russian hackers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-orders-trump-adviser-roger-stone-to-report-to-prison-by-july-14/story-GiX3puxUvE9O2XUgJaWz5H.html
27-06-2020||World||Mumbai attack convict Headley cannot be extradited to India; Rana faces extradition: US attorney||Mumbai terrorist attack convict David Headley cannot be extradited to India, but Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman co-conspirator Tahawwur Rana faces extradition, a US attorney has told a federal court while opposing his bail plea.Rana, 59, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was recently rearrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. He is a declared fugitive in India.According to the federal prosecutors, between 2006 and November 2008, Rana conspired with Headley, also known as “Daood Gilani”, and others in Pakistan to assist Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Harakat ul-Jihad-e-Islami, both US-designated terrorist organisations, to plan and carry out the Mumbai terrorist attacks.Pakistani-American LeT terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.The US is yet to file India’s request for Rana’s extradition, but is expected to do it soon. It is evident that the offences for which Rana was tried in the Illinois court will differ from the Indian offences mentioned in the complaint.Rana in his defence has argued that US’ decision not to extradite his co-conspirator, Headley, to India is inconsistent and bars his extradition.However, Assistant US Attorney John J Lulejian told a federal court in Los Angeles on Friday that unlike Rana, Headley immediately accepted responsibility for his conduct and pleaded guilty to all of the charges in the Superseding Indictment.“Because Headley fulfilled the required terms, the plea agreement established that Headley would not be extradited to India. Rana’s situation is different because he neither pleaded guilty nor cooperated with the United States.“As a result, he is unable to avail himself of the benefits afforded to Headley through his negotiated plea. Thus, he cannot complain that he faces extradition, while his co-defendant does not,” the US attorney said.Rana’s bail application is due for hearing next week. Early this week, his attorney told the court that the 26/11 convict is not a flight risk and has proposed a USD 1.5 million bond for his release.“Rana should be released on a robust bond: secured by approximately USD 1.5 million in property pledged by family and friends and under the supervision of his daughter, Lemaan Rana, a matriculating medical student and Ph.D. candidate,” Amy Karlin, the Interim Federal Public Defender, said in the court submission on behalf of Rana.India seeks his arrest on a number of offences, including the conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit forgery for the purpose of cheating, and murder under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He is sought for his role in 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai.The US attorney urged the court to continue his detention pending the extradition proceedings to India. Describing Rana as a flight risk, the attorney said that no matter what bond package he offers, Rana poses an unacceptable flight risk.If the US extradites Rana to India and he is convicted of the charges, he may be eligible for the death penalty. Given what is at stake, Rana has an extreme incentive to flee and avoid facing these extradition proceedings, Lulejian said.“He could accomplish this by going into hiding within the US, but he has a particular incentive to go to another country that may not extradite him without assurances from India that it will not seek, impose or carry out the death penalty,” the attorney argued.If Rana were to flee to Canada, his extradition from Canada to the US would take years and would require substantial resources by the governments of both Canada and the United States, and there is no guarantee that Canada would ultimately grant that extradition request, he said.However, even if Canada granted the request from the US, the terms of the US-Canada extradition treaty would prohibit the US from extraditing Rana to a third country, such as India, unless Canada granted its consent to do so, Lulejian said.Not only does Rana have an incentive to flee, but he has numerous international connections who can help facilitate his flight, he told the court.Rana ran an international immigration business for many years in Chicago, which allowed him to develop professional and personal relationships around the world.“Moreover, he was convicted of plotting an attack with and providing material support to an international terrorist organisation based in Pakistan. These international connections enhance Rana’s flight risk because they can provide the means to flee this jurisdiction and potentially avoid extradition to India,” Lulejian added.The 2008 Mumbai attack was one of India’s most horrific terrorist attacks in which 166 people were killed and over 300 injured as 10 heavily-armed terrorists from Pakistan created mayhem.Pakistani national Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist captured alive, was hanged to death on November 21, 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mumbai-attack-convict-headley-cannot-be-extradited-to-india-rana-faces-extradition-us-attorney/story-gzpnrD7C34vQkzgnyzErNJ.html

He was AWOL||Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli who pushed through the country’s new political map in an effort to consolidate his position in Nepal Communist Party, or NCP, and the government is coming under intense pressure from within to quit one of his two posts. PM Oli is also one of the NCP’s two chairpersons, a post that he shares with his arch rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal, better known by his nom de guerre Prachanda.PM Oli on Friday absented himself from the meeting of the NCP’s powerful standing committee though the party panel was meeting at his official residence. PM Oli had sent word to the panel that he would join them later but never turned up, according to reports in the Kathmandu media.The standing committee meetings were initially scheduled to begin on May 7 but Oli, who is severely short of support within the 44-member panel, had put them off.Kathmandu watchers in Delhi say he had expected the new political map rushed through parliament this month to project himself as one prime minister who stood up to its giant neighbour to shield him from pressure from within. That didn’t appear to be happening when PM Oli attended the first meeting of the standing committee on Thursday. Prachanda, reports in the Nepal media suggest, was merciless in his criticism.Prachanda, according to a report in The Kathmandu Post, had expressed regret for a November pact that agreed to let Oli run the government for five years while he leads the party as executive chair. “Either we have to part ways or we need to mend ways… Since parting is not possible, we need to mend our ways, for which we must be ready to sacrifice,” Prachanda said, according to the Post.PM Oli, who has already been a target of attacks for his government’s handling of th Covid-19 pandemic, did mount a counter attack at Thursday’s meeting. But on Friday, PM Oli, as one Nepal newspaper headlined its report, decided to “play hooky”.“A chairman avoiding his own party’s meeting is disgraceful. He should have listened to his party leaders,” Gokarna Bista, a Standing Committee member who is counted in Prachanda’s camp said, according to the Post.“Many leaders are preparing to seek Oli’s resignation as a majority of the party feels that Oli cannot be trusted to run the government anymore,” said Matrika Yadav, a Standing Committee member also close to Dahal, told the newspaper.PM Oli, according to reports, had hoped to pin down the rival camp with a new political map that depicts Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura that have been controlled by India as part of Nepalese territory. It did get complete support from parliamentarians because no one wanted to be seen to be going against the country’s territorial integrity. But at NCP’s meeting on Friday, there were also suggestions that the Oli government should have handled the entire row better.The Post quoted two NCP members as saying that the Oli government was criticised for not doing adequate homework to hold talks with India, failing to cultivate alternative lines of communication with New Delhi, and also failing to propagate Nepal’s claim to its lands on national and international platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-communist-party-s-top-panel-met-at-pm-oli-s-house-he-was-awol/story-4izK7g1wMlSFrZ42be8mpN.html

Violence has include burning houses and killing cattle.Militias from the Peulh community were behind dozens of violent incidents with the Dogon community — mainly farmers and hunters — that killed 210 people, her office said. Dogon-related groups carried out 12 attacks, leaving at least 82 people dead, it said.The human rights division of the UN peacekeeping mission has documented “230 extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions” attributed to the Malian military in the central regions of Mopti and Segou, Bachelet’s office said.She lamented “a situation of chronic insecurity for the civilian population, who are not able to count on the protection of the Malian forces.” “This needs to stop,” Bachelet said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-human-rights-chief-urges-mali-to-probe-abuse-by-security-forces/story-WdVQBj7HyENBgQTfCE2B9N.html
27-06-2020||World||51st state: US House approves statehood of Washington, DC, in historic vote||Four decades after launching its drive for U.S. statehood, Washington, D.C., was poised to take a step toward becoming the 51st state as the House of Representatives on Friday approved its admission.The initiative passed in the Democratic-controlled House by a vote of 232-180, with no Republicans supporting it.The Republican-controlled Senate is not expected to consider the legislation, and Republican President Donald Trump has publicly opposed the move, noting that statehood would result in electing more Democrats to Congress. Indeed, voters in the city of Washington have elected only Democratic mayors. Creating a state out of Washington would likely make it more difficult for Republicans to win majorities in the Senate.On the House floor ahead of the vote, Republican lawmakers argued that making the district into a state was a political ploy by Democrats and would require an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Some also said Washington was not equipped to be a state and should be absorbed back into Maryland.Proponents say Washington’s 700,000 inhabitants - more than Vermont and Wyoming - have no voice in the federal government, despite paying federal taxes. That status is protested with a slogan on Washington’s automobile license plates that screams: “Taxation without representation.”Currently, legislation passed by the district’s local government is subject to congressional review.“Congress has two choices: It can continue to exercise undemocratic, autocratic authority over the 705,000 American citizens who reside in our nation’s capital ... or Congress can live up to its nation’s promise and ideals,” said Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington’s congresswoman. Norton is not able to vote on legislation.Local anger over the district’s status flared up most recently during the coronavirus pandemic. Washington received $500 million for its pandemic response, compared with the $1.2 billion the federal government accorded to each of the 50 states.Amid nationwide protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd, an African-American man who died after a police officer kneeled against Floyd’s neck, Trump sent National Guard troops to the district, over the objection of the district’s mayor, to quell protests against racism and police brutality.The state would be named Washington, Douglass Commonwealth, after George Washington, the first U.S. president, and Frederick Douglass, a former enslaved person turned famed abolitionist.It would include the district’s residents, but not major federal buildings, the National Mall, memorials and the museums, which would be housed in a federal enclave.The last time the United States expanded was 1959, when Congress approved admitting Alaska and Hawaii as the 49th and 50th states, respectively, following congressional votes and the support of the president.The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to admit new states without specifying a process.Washington, dubbed a “Chocolate City” by the funk band Parliament, has been recorded as a majority-Black city since the 1960 Census. Black Americans now make up 46% of the district’s population, the same percentage of White Americans.

27-06-2020||World||Nile countries agree to restart talks over disputed dam||The leaders of Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia agreed late Friday to return to talks aimed at reaching an accord over the filling of Ethiopia’s new hydroelectric dam on the Blue Nile, according to statements from the three nations.Early Saturday, Seleshi Bekele, Ethiopia’s water and energy minister, confirmed that the countries had decided during an African Union summit to restart stalled negotiations and finalize an agreement over the contentious mega-project within two to three weeks, with support from the AU.The announcement was a modest reprieve from weeks of bellicose rhetoric and escalating tensions over the $4.6 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which Ethiopia had vowed to start filling at the start of the rainy season in July.Egypt and Sudan said Ethiopia would refrain from filling the dam next month until the countries reached a deal. Ethiopia did not comment explicitly on the start of the filling period.Ethiopia has hinged its development ambitions on the colossal dam, describing it as a crucial lifeline to bring millions out of poverty.Egypt, which relies on the Nile for more than 90% of its water supplies and already faces high water stress, fears a devastating impact on its booming population of 100 million. Sudan, which also depends on the Nile for water, has played a key role in bringing the two sides together after the collapse of U.S.-mediated talks in February.Just last week, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Gedu Andargachew warned that his country could begin filling the dam’s reservoir unilaterally, after the latest round of talks with Egypt and Sudan failed to reach an accord governing how the dam will be filled and operated.After an AU video conference chaired by South Africa late Friday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said that “all parties” had pledged not to take “any unilateral action” by filling the dam without a final agreement, said Bassam Radi, Egypt’s presidency spokesman.Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok also indicated the impasse between the Nile basin countries had eased, saying the nations had agreed to restart negotiations through a technical committee with the aim of finalizing a deal in two weeks. Ethiopia won’t fill the dam before inking the much-anticipated deal, Hamdok’s statement added.African Union Commission Chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat said the countries “agreed to an AU-led process to resolve outstanding issues,” without elaborating.Sticking points in the talks have been how much water Ethiopia will release downstream from the dam if a multi-year drought occurs and how Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan will resolve any future disagreements.Both Egypt and Sudan have appealed to the UN Security Council to intervene in the years-long dispute and help the countries avert a crisis. The council is set to hold a public meeting on the issue Monday.Filling the dam without an agreement could bring the stand-off to a critical juncture. Both Egypt and Ethiopia have hinted at military steps to protect their interests, and experts fear a breakdown in talks could lead to open conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nile-countries-agree-to-restart-talks-over-disputed-dam/story-6Ws7z3HXhN43lxRUiftjwL.html

Beijing reported its first case in the current outbreak on June 11 which stemmed from a sprawling wholesale food centre in the southwest of the capital. Nearly 300 people in the city of more than 20 million have contracted the virus.Mainland China reported four new so-called imported cases on Friday, infections linked to travellers arriving from abroad. China’s Covid-19 tally now stands at 83,483 with death toll stood at 4,634, unchanged since mid-May.United StatesIn the US, a top public health official has said that the actual number of cumulative Covid-19 infections in the country could be around 10 times the reported number.“We are facing a serious problem in certain areas,” leading US immunologist Anthony Fauci said at the first briefing in two months by the White House’s Coronavirus Task Force.“The only way we’re going to end it is by ending it together,” he said of the outbreak.The US currently leads the global tally with over 2.5 million Covid-19 cases and is reporting over 30,000 cases daily. With nearly 125,000 lives lost, it has by far the highest confirmed Covid-19 death toll in the world. A resurgence in coronavirus cases has put brakes on reopening two of the country’s largest states - Texas and Florida.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/serious-problem-china-us-battle-threat-of-new-wave-of-covid-19-cases/story-MXO4cfefBvJLjdbt4wH20I.html
27-06-2020||World||28 gunmen, allegedly from Jalisco drug cartel, ambush Mexico City police chief||Dozens of gunmen believed tied to the hyper-violent Jalisco New Generation Cartel deployed for a complex, multi-point dawn ambush meant to kill Mexico City’s police chief, unleashing one of the most brazen attacks in Mexico since the equally ruthless Zetas carved a path of terror across the country nearly a decade ago.The attackers used grenades and a .50-caliber sniper rifle to assault the chief’s armored vehicle early Friday and killed two of the his bodyguards and a woman driving by. Police chief Omar García Harfuch was shot in the shoulder, collar bone and the knee but was reported out of danger.He called the attack “cowardly” and blamed it on the Jalisco cartel, which has established a nearly national presence, from the white-sand beaches of Cancun to Mexico City and the country’s most important ports, as well as in key border cities traditionally controlled by other cartels.Police officers who converged on the scene on the capital’s iconic Paseo de la Reforma boulevard in the upscale Lomas neighborhood rounded up a dozen of the shooters, who were hauled off for questioning, authorities said.Later Friday, capital police arrested an alleged head of Jalisco New Generation hitmen, suggesting he could have been the mastermind of the attack, said a Mexico City police official who was not authorized to be quoted by name.The official said police arrested José Armando Briseño on the east side of the city. Nicknamed “Cow,” he is allegedly the gang’s chief of hitmen in the city of Tonalá inJalisco.The attack on the police chief was meticulously planned and involved a total of 28 gunmen hired three weeks before, said Ulises Lara, the spokesman for the Mexico City prosecutors office. Three separate possible ambush points were set up on major thoroughfares, including one — which wasn’t used — in the heart of Mexico City, one block from the Independence Monument.The gunmen were divided into four different cells, and they received ski masks and weapons Thursday night. They were taken to the ambush points at 4 a.m. to lie in wait for their target. They jumped from a truck and opened fire when Garcia’s convoy attempted to pass.Lara said that of the suspects detained, one is Colombian and the other 11 are Mexicans from the capital and five states — Jalisco, Guerrero, Nayarit, Chihuahua and Michoacan.It was the second high-profile attack just this month, following the shooting death of a federal judge and his wife, bringing uncomfortable comparisons to Colombia’s drug wars of the 1980s and ‘90s in which drug traffickers routinely targeted judges and police for assassination.Mexico targeted and dismantled the Zetas cartel after it killed migrants, unsuspecting citizens and officials from 2010 to 2013. But it remains to be seen whether the government will go after the Jalisco cartel they way it did the Zetas.“If they (Jalisco) are not made a priority target after this, I don’t know what is happening, something is wrong with the strategy” of the government, said security analyst Alejandro Hope.With the Zetas, Mexico used elite military units and worked closely with the United States to go after the cartel. But now, amid budget cuts and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s policy of not directly confronting the cartels, it is unclear whether the government has the will or ability to fight Jalisco, especially in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.“This kind of attack is not normal, they crossed a line. You have to read it like an exceptional act,” said Hope. “You have two very serious attacks in two weeks.”Federal Security Secretary Alfonso Durazo said Mexico’s intelligence agency apparently had information that Jalisco New Generation was planning an attack, but did not offer additional details.It was unclear whether the attack was related to recent crackdowns on Jalisco-affiliated gangs in Mexico City or to the police chief’s earlier work in federal investigations.García, 37, is a former head of the Federal Police investigation division and in 2016-2019 he led the branch of the federal Attorney General’s Office that oversees investigations and arrests of organized crime members. Before being named Mexico City police chief, he spent several months as the mayor’s intelligence coordinator.Jalisco is the same gang that U.S. prosecutors said tried to buy belt-fed M-60 machine guns in the United States and that once shot down a Mexican military helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade. In October, the cartel’s gunmen ambushed and killed 14 state police officers in Michoacan.Friday’s attack came two weeks after rumors swirled for a day that Jalisco’s leader, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, better known as “El Mencho,” had been captured or killed — though officials later denied that. Oseguera is the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s most-wanted fugitive, with a $10 million price on his head.In March, US authorities arrested hundreds of Jalisco operatives in raids across the United States. They said the gang controls between one-third and two-thirds of the U.S. drug market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/28-gunmen-allegedly-from-jalisco-drug-cartel-ambush-mexico-city-police-chief/story-UT2Qv6FELbiFizGUNk0V1O.html
27-06-2020||World||Trump signs ‘strong’ executive order to protect monuments||President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday to protect monuments, memorials and statues facing new scrutiny amid fresh debate over the nation’s racist beginnings.Trump had promised to take action earlier this week after police thwarted an attempt by protesters to pull down a statue of Andrew Jackson in a park across from the White House.The order calls on the attorney general to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law any person or group that destroys or vandalizes a monument, memorial or statue. Federal law authorizes a penalty of up to 10 years in prison for the “willful injury” of federal property.The order also calls for maximum prosecution for anyone who incites violence and illegal activity, and it threatens state and local law enforcement agencies that fail to protect monuments with the loss of federal funding.Trump announced earlier Friday on Twitter that he had signed the order and called it “strong.”Earlier in the day, the president used Twitter to call for the arrest of protesters involved with the attempt to bring down the Jackson statue from Lafayette Park.He retweeted an FBI wanted poster showing pictures of 15 protesters who are wanted for “vandalization of federal property.”Trump wrote, “MANY people in custody, with many others being sought for Vandalization of Federal Property in Lafayette Park. 10 year prison sentences!”He also said on Twitter that he had scrapped plans to spend the weekend at his central New Jersey home to stay in Washington “to make sure LAW & ORDER is enforced.”“These arsonists, anarchists, looters, and agitators have been largely stopped,” Trump tweeted. “I am doing what is necessary to keep our communities safe — and these people will be brought to Justice!”Protesters on Monday night attempted to drag the Jackson statue down with ropes and chains. Police repelled the protesters and sealed off Lafayette Park, which had been reopened to the public for more than a week after protests against the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota. On Tuesday, police cleared out the entire area around the corner of 16th and H streets — and pushed demonstrators away from the intersection, which had recently been renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza by the city.Statistics released by the Metropolitan Police Department show that nine people were arrested Tuesday night and a total of 12 arrested between Monday and Wednesday. There were no protest-related arrests Thursday, according to the MPD data.Demonstrators have grown increasingly emboldened about targeting statues deemed offensive or inappropriate. On June 19, or Juneteenth, the day marking the end of slavery in the United States, cheering crowds puled down a statue of Confederate Gen. Albert Pike. The statue stood on federal land and had withstood previous attempts by the Washington, D.C., government to remove it. According to participants, police officers were on the scene but did not attempt to interfere.The targeting of the statues has become a rallying cry for Trump and other conservatives. Immediately after the Pike statute was toppled and set ablaze, Trump called the incident a “disgrace to our Country!” on Twitter.On Tuesday he tweeted, “I have authorized the Federal Government to arrest anyone who vandalizes or destroys any monument, statue or other such Federal property in the U.S. with up to 10 years in prison, per the Veteran’s Memorial Preservation Act, or such other laws that may be pertinent.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-signs-strong-executive-order-to-protect-monuments/story-6cbrEhN5mDFBJtBc3q903O.html

The ambush left chief Omar García Harfuch wounded with three bullet impacts and shrapnel. Two members of his security detail were killed, as was a woman who happened to be driving by.A day earlier in the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa, state police said they had found the bodies of seven men wearing military-style clothing in a pickup truck in a rural area near the city of Culiacán. In another area nearby, police found nine more bodies, at least one of which had an assault rifle. Two bullet-riddled vehicles were found nearby. There had been a series of shootouts there Wednesday.Sinaloa is home the cartel of the same name, and the dead men appeared to have been involved in turf battles between factions of the cartel.“Clearly there is a fight between organized crime groups in this area,” said state police chief Cristobal Castañeda, noting that in the last month police have seized five belt-fed machine guns, two .50-caliber sniper rifles and about 35,000 bullets in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/30-bodies-found-dumped-in-2-northern-mexico-states/story-epzH0Y4KjTKfLQuREckjuL.html

Unilever said it would stop spending money with Facebook’s properties this year.The share-price drop eliminated $56 billion from Facebook’s market value and pushed Zuckerberg’s net worth down to $82.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That also moved the Facebook chief executive officer down one notch to fourth place, overtaken by Louis Vuitton boss Bernard Arnault, who was elevated to one of the world’s three richest people along with Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates.Companies from Verizon Communications Inc. to Hershey Co. have also stopped social media ads after critics said that Facebook has failed to sufficiently police hate speech and disinformation on the platform. Coca-Cola Co. said it would pause all paid advertising on all social media platforms for at least 30 days.Zuckerberg responded Friday to the growing criticism about misinformation on the site, announcing the company would label all voting-related posts with a link encouraging users to look at its new voter information hub. Facebook also expanded its definition of prohibited hate speech, adding a clause saying no adverts will be allowed if they label another demographic as dangerous.“There are no exceptions for politicians in any of the policies I’m announcing here today,” Zuckerberg said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mark-zuckerberg-loses-7-billion-as-companies-boycott-facebook-ads/story-GQ4uSwy0K5zhqpxnihZvvJ.html

An arrest warrant has been issued against the 70-year-old three-time premier who is in London for medical treatment. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has approached an anti-corruption court to declare Sharif a proclaimed offender since he did not respond to any of its summons. The three other accused named in the case filed by the NAB are Jang/Geo media group owner Mir Shakilur Rahman, former Lahore Development Authority (LDA) director Humayun Faiz Rasool and former director (land) Mian Bashir. In 1986, when he was the Punjab chief minister, Sharif had allegedly allotted 54-’kanal’ (canal) land in Lahore to Mir Shakilur Rehman in violation of rules. Rahman, who was arrested on March 12, is on judicial remand. In the reference, Sharif and the two officers were accused of the misuse of authority in allotting the precious land along the canal to Rahman in violation of the rules. Sharif had left for London in November after the Lahore High Court granted him a four-week permission to go abroad for treatment.He had submitted an undertaking to the court to return to Pakistan, citing his record of facing the law and justice, within four weeks or as soon as he is declared healthy and fit to travel by doctors.Last month, a fresh picture of ‘ailing’ Sharif having tea at a London cafe along with his family went viral on social media, sparking a debate on his health with the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf members demanding his return to face corruption cases.In the picture, he was seen sitting at a roadside café with his granddaughters. He sported a blue shalwar kameez and a cap and apparently looked in better health. Sharif was given bail in the Al-Azizia Mills corruption case, in which he was serving a seven-year prison sentence in Kot Lakhpat Jail. He was also given bail in a money-laundering case to facilitate his travel abroad. Sharif was diagnosed with “complicated coronary artery/ischemic heart disease with significant disease burden”. His daughter Maryam Nawaz had said that her father was a high-risk patient therefore his cardiac catheterisation/coronary intervention had been postponed due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-s-anti-graft-body-files-corruption-case-against-former-pm-nawaz-sharif/story-UegFZrOFrKVMqBQV3JWwEM.html
27-06-2020||World||Canadian visa program may lure tech workers blocked by Trump||A fast-track visa program that Canada launched in 2017 has attracted a growing number of tech workers, and US President Donald Trump’s latest immigration crackdown is set to further boost intake once Covid-19 restrictions ease, lawyers say.The number of successful applicants to Canada’s Global Skills Strategy (GSS) program rose five-fold over its first three years, with more than 23,000 workers approved under the top five tech categories, data provided to Reuters by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) shows.More than 2,300 applications for those same top five tech roles were approved from January to March 2020, ahead of the Covid-19 shutdowns that led to border closures and a sharp drop in immigration. The program boasts a two-week processing time.Immigration lawyers told Reuters they were broadly in favor of the program, which some described as transparent and consistent, and an example of how Canada has been able to take advantage of Trump’s immigration stance since he entered the White House in 2017.“There are employers who have non-US employees in the US who are definitely looking seriously at Canada,” said Kyle Hyndman, a partner with McCrea Immigration Law in Vancouver, who was contacted this week by a “major” company about bringing employees to Canada.On Monday, Trump issued a presidential proclamation that temporarily blocks foreign workers from entering the United States on certain visas, which a Trump administration official said would create 525,000 jobs for US workers.“The fact that people started contacting me pretty much the next day is perhaps a suggestion that there are going to be more people interested,” Hyndman said.US technology companies including Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc and Netflix Inc have in recent years expanded their Canadian operations, although most companies declined to comment on their GSS usage or how Trump’s recent announcement will impact their hiring plans.Tobi Lutke, the chief executive officer of Canadian e-commerce company Shopify, was quick to tout the Canada’s attraction following Trump’s immigration move.The program “has made it possible to hire top talent beyond our borders,” said Sandeep Anand, senior lead on the global mobility team at Shopify, adding that it has helped relocate employees to Canada.The majority of approved applicants to the fast-track visa program were computer programmers and interactive media developers, followed by information systems analysts and consultants, the IRCC data shows.Indian citizens accounted for 62.1% of successful applicants to the fast-track program, followed by Chinese citizens. Nearly 1,000 US citizens also have seen their applications approved.The GSS data only covers the period up to March of this year, just before broader immigration in Canada fell off a cliff due to border closures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Lawyers, however, don’t expect it to last.Betsy Kane, one of the founding partners of Capelle Kane Immigration Lawyers in Ottawa, said the program is going to see a surge of applications.“Whenever one door shuts, the other door is sought.”(Reporting by Moira Warburton in Toronto and Steve Scherer in Ottawa; Additional reporting by Julie Gordon in Ottawa Editing by Denny Thomas and Paul Simao)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-visa-program-may-lure-tech-workers-blocked-by-trump/story-We3mdtFT77io6FLlx5K6EN.html

27-06-2020||India||ED quizzes Patel in PMLA case; Congress slams govt||New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday questioned senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel for eight hours over his purported links with the Sandesara brothers of the Sterling Biotech group, who fled the country in 2017 after defrauding banks of several thousand crore rupees, officials said.The officials, who requested anonymity, said Patel, 70, who was political secretary to Sonia Gandhi when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance was in power between 2004 and 2014, was questioned at his residence -- 23, Mother Teresa Crescent -- in Delhi by a three-member ED team. He was earlier summoned for questioning, but the leader cited Covid-19 guidelines and expressed his inability to visit the agency. The health ministry had issued an advisory for citizens above 65 years to stay at home to protect themselves against the coronavirus pandemic.Patel, who was supposed to appear at the ED office on June 8, had also pointed out that cases of the disease had surfaced in the agency, which told him that its officers were willing to visit his home because taking the probe forward in the case was important.The Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament from Gujarat, officials said, was asked questions about his links with Nitin and Chetan Sandesara and claims made by certain witnesses.An employee of the Sandesara Group – Sunil Yadav – had claimed before the ED he ran up expenses of Rs 10 lakh for a party which was attended by Faisal Patel, son of Ahmed Patel, arranged entry in a night club for him (Faisal Patel) and once delivered Rs 5 lakh to his (Faisal Patel’s) driver in Khan Market on the instructions of Chetan Sandesara, officials said. Yadav told the ED investigation team that the money was meant for Faisal Patel, officials added.Yadav also claimed before the ED that Ahmed Patel’s son Faisal and son-in-law Irfan Siddiqui were even given code names by Chetan Sandesara.Faisal Patel and Irfan Siddiqui were questioned by ED in August and July 2019 respectively.The anti-money laundering probe agency is investigating fraud worth over Rs 14,500 crore by Sterling Biotech and its promoters - Nitin, Chetan and Deepti Sandesara.They have been absconding since 2017 and are said to be hiding in Nigeria. An Interpol red corner notice request is also pending against them.The Sandesaras are being probed by multiple agencies including the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the income tax department .An investigation against the Vadodara-based Sterling Biotech began in 2017 when CBI registered a case for alleged fraud of Rs 5,000 crore on a consortium led by Andhra Bank. The ED has claimed that the fraud is bigger than the Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud to the tune of how much money involving Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi.In June 2019, ED attached moveable and immovable properties worth Rs 9,778 crores belonging to the Sandesaras including four oil rigs and oil fields in Nigeria and several ships apart from a Gulfstream aircraft and flat in London.Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal said: “If you need to probe something, then why don’t you probe the names that appeared in the Sahara diary? There are some important people who are now power, why can’t CBI launch a probe against them? The (ED raid) is a motivated move that is aimed to divert attention from the bigger issues that have come up before the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-quizzes-patel-in-pmla-case-congress-slams-govt/story-ZPPDaxoDLBYgj8y8GMLcBJ.html

All these cases are basically referred to the railway claim tribunal and on case to case basis these claims and compensations are decided and there is a very well laid-out procedure for that.” Yadav said at a virtual press conference on Friday.Hindustan Times reported on May 30 that around 80 people had died on Shramik Special trains from May 9 till May 27, according to a Railway Protection Force report. Railways had clarified that the deaths had occurred because of pre-existing ailments.Yadav said that the ministry of railways is yet to collate the final list of deaths on board Shramik trains.“As far as the list is concerned, basically this is a state subject and so many states are involved and all these cases handled by state governments and they only finalise the cases so all those lists are yet to be collated...so far we haven’t been able to get the information from all the states but all the state governments are looking into those cases and they will be able to share the information only when they complete all the investigation and come out with their final report,” he said. In an interview to HT on June 1, railways minister Piyush Goyal said the ministry had been transparent about the deaths on board Shramik Special trains and insisted on compiling a list of them.“Some of the stories are sought to be portrayed as if people died of hunger or starvation. I can say with confidence that no one died of hunger,” he said, adding that in long-distance travel, some deaths occur even in the course of normal operations.To be clear, railways provides ex-gratia payment to victims of railway accidents under the Railway Act. The national transporter had in 2017 increased the compensation amount for the family of a deceased person to Rs 8 lakh. Compensation can also be sought under section 123 of the act citing “untoward incident.” However, in other cases, a claim for compensation can be pressed through the railway claims tribunal.“Ex-gratia is given for railway accidents caused by railways itself due to derailment or collision or any other fault. For cases of untoward incidents involving deaths or injuries caused mostly by passengers or people themselves either by trespassing or run over or accidentally falling from a train, usually no ex-gratia given. People can claim compensation through the railway claims tribunal,” a railway official explained, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/claims-for-shramik-train-deaths-to-be-referred-to-tribunal-railways/story-dj0tE7KbQljxU15dAzrSJM.html
27-06-2020||India||FIR in Rajasthan against Ramdev, aides over ‘Coronil’||A First Information Report (FIR) has been filed in Rajasthan against yoga guru Baba Ramdev, his aide and chief executive officer of Patanjali Ayurved Limited, Acharya Balkrishna, and three others for allegedly making misleading claims that the company has found a cure for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) called Coronil.The FIR was filed at the Jyoti Nagar police station in Jaipur on Friday evening by an advocate, Balbir Jakhar.A case against Ramdev, Balkrishna, Dr. Balbir Singh Tomar, Dr. Anurag Tomar and Anurag Varshney is being investigated under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954, on the basis of the FIR lodged by Jakhar, said Avnish Parashar, additional deputy commissioner of police (DCP), south, Jaipur.Dr. Balbir Singh Tomar is chairman of NIMS University in Jaipur where clinical trials on Coronil were carried out , Dr. Anurag Tomar is director, NIMS University and Varshney is a scientist at Patanjali Ayurved Ltd.“The accused have put the life of common people at risk. Neither the Rajasthan government nor the Centre was informed about the clinical trials about Coronil,” Jhakhar said.Acharya Balkrishna refused to comment on the FIR being lodged. However, Patanjali spokesperson Gagan Kumar, said, “Patanjali never termed Coronil as anti-Corona medicine. If a case has been registered against us regarding it, then our legal cell will reply accordingly.”His comment is at odds with the title under which the clinical trial was registered with the clinical trials regulator: an ayurvedic cure for the coronavirus disease. Kumar added: “Nobody should question Patanjali’s patriotic intent and social welfare works.”Ramdev’s herbal medicine company, Patanjali Ayurved, on Monday, launched the Coronil tablets and Swasarivati medicine that they claimed to cure the contagion within seven days.Patanjali Ayurved also claimed that the two Ayurveda-based medicines have shown 100% favourable results during clinical trials on Covid-19 patients. Hindutan Times reported the doctor in charge of the clinical trials saying that the trials were ongoing, that these were preliminary findings, that the test was not carried out on patients with co-morbidities, and that only asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic Covid-19 patients were selected fr the study. The ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) said it was unaware of Patanjali Ayurved’s claims.The ministry has sought a report from the company about the composition, testing and other data on the drugs.Patanjali Ayurved has also been asked to “stop advertising/publicising” the drugs until the ministry examines its claims.The company launched its products at a press conference and Ramdev later went on several television channels to talk about them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fir-in-rajasthan-against-ramdev-aides-over-coronil/story-NZtKcd5ui669er4eZkxOkO.html
27-06-2020||India||BJP, Congress trade fresh barbs||A war of words between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress over the Sino-India border dispute and alleged links between China and the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF), a trust chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, intensified on Saturday with allegations and counter-allegations flying thick and fast on both sides. BJP president JP Nadda asked the principal opposition party a series of questions, reiterated allegations that RGF received donations from the Chinese embassy when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) was in power at the Centre, said his party will leave no stone unturned in “exposing double-faced politicians”, and alleged that fugitive economic offender Mehul Choksi gave donations to the trust.The BJP says both the Chinese government and the Chinese embassy in India have contributed to RGF, and even the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) donated money to the trust when the Congress-led UPA was in power.“I want to tell Sonia Gandhi that under the garb of China and Covid-19 crisis, one should not shy away from answering the questions the nation wants to know... It’s a shame. It’s a sacrifice of national interest by accepting money from foreign powers in personal trusts,” Nadda said in a statement.He alleged that RGF received donations from the Chinese embassy between 2005 and 2009 and from “tax havens” such as Luxembourg between 2006 and 2009. NGOs and companies with “deep commercial interests” also donated to the foundation, he said.“Congress and corruption are synonymous,” Nadda said, asking the opposition party to come clean on its “links” with China and the details of its MoU (memorandum of understanding) with the Communist Party of China. He said India’s trade deficit with China soared to $36.2 billion in 2013-14 from $1.1 billion in 2003-2004, and asked if it was a “quid pro quo”. The Congress-led UPA was in power between 2004 and 2014.Nadda also targeted former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, accusing him of allocating Rs 100 crore to the foundation as the finance minister in 1991, when India was going through its “worst financial crisis”.Singh and Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and P Chidambaram are trustees of RGF, which was set up in June 1991. “RGF not only takes money from scams but also gives dodgy donations to their own organisations. Why did it turn donate money to Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust controlled by the family and Christian Missionary organisations like World Vision?” Nadda asked, referring to the Nehru-Gandhi family.He alleged that RGF worked with the China Association for Internationally Friendly Contact, “which is just a vehicle of the Central Military Commission of China to infiltrate and influence top voices in other countries”. He said the UPA government forced multiple ministries, including the home ministry and the health ministry, and public sector units such as SAIL, SBI, GAIL, and ONGC to donate to RGF. He also wondered how RGF, a private charitable trust, could function from Jawahar Bhawan, a prime location in the heart of Delhi. “Why was a Congress man’s company auditing PMNRF? PMNRF auditor’s name is Thakur, Vaidyanathan and Aiyyar Co, founded by Mr Rameshwar Thakur (who was a Rajya Sabha MP for two terms, former MoS finance, and the governor of four states),” Nadda said. In its reply, the Congress dared the ruling party to ask the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) — the BJP’s ideological mentor — and think-tanks Vivekananda International Foundation and India Foundation —considered pro-BJP — to disclose their source of funding and donors. “Will the BJP disclose the source of funding, amounts received, name of donors [including of Chinese origin] for “Overseas Friends of BJP [OF-BJP]”?” Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala asked. “...What is the connection of Shri Rajkumar Naraindas Sabnani alias Raju Sabnani to OF-BJP?” he added. Sabnani is a businessman based in Hong Kong.Surjewala said neither did RGF receive any donation from Choksi, wanted in the Punjab National Bank fraud case, and nor did it give him any loan to him. But the foundation received “a modest donation of Rs. 10 lakh from Naviraj Estates Pvt. Ltd. in 2013, of which Shri Choksi was one of the Directors”.S Gurumurthy, the chairman of Vivekananda International Foundation (VIF), said on Twitter its trust deed prohibits receipt of foreign donations. “...It permits donations from people of Indian origin associated with VIF. As yet no one has got associated and no donations have been received,” he said.Earlier on Saturday, former Union minister P Chidambaram targeted Nadda in a series of tweets, a day after the BJP chief accused the Congress of committing a “brazen fraud” by diverting public money in PMNRF to a “family-run foundation”.PMNRF was set up in 1948 by India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, entirely with public contributions. It does not get any budgetary support. PMNRF resources are utilised primarily to give relief to families of those killed in natural calamities, and to victims of major accidents and riots, according to its website.Chidambaram said Nadda “specialises in half-truths”, and pointed out that Surjewala “exposed his half-truths”.In his rebuttal on Friday, Surjewala issued a statement saying the BJP and the central government “keep referring to a 2005 grant of Rs 1.45 crores” from the Chinese embassy to RGF for a disabled persons’ welfare programme and research on Sino-India relations. The statement also said after the 2004 tsunami, RGF received Rs 20 lakh from PMNRF for relief activities in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.“What has the grant to RGF 15 years ago got to do with China’s intrusion into Indian territory in 2020 under the watch of the Modi government? “Suppose RGF returns the Rs 20 lakh, will PM Modi assure the country that China will vacate its transgression and restore status quo ante?” Chidambaram asked.The allegations and counter-allegations come against the backdrop of a face-off between India and China along the contested border. Twenty Indian Army soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops died in a brawl in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15, ratcheting up tensions between the neighbours amidst a military build-up on both sides of the disputed border. While the Congress accuses the government of ceding ground to the Chinese, the ruling BJP says the opposition party is playing with issues of national security. The Congress also says the BJP is raking up the RGF donation issue to divert attention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-congress-trade-fresh-barbs/story-oUYUMZgtpjtMVt7rEVAtBN.html

27-06-2020||India||A ‘pleasant surprise’ claim experts on rare sighting of Finn’s Weaver birds in Uttarakhand||Endemic to the Indian subcontinent and tagged vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), a colony of Finn’s Weaver birds were sighted recently by forest officials in the Terai Central forest division of Uttarakhand after many decades, forest officials said. More than 20 nests of the bird were spotted by forest officials.The Finn’s Weaver or Yellow Weaver was first spotted in Uttarakhand in the 1950s by eminent ornithologist Dr Salim Ali. The bird, usually found in areas near agricultural fields or the Terai region, has seen a decline in population since the past few decades and experts called the sighting a ‘pleasant surprise’.Dhananjai Mohan, Director of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and co-author of the ‘Updated Checklist and Bibliography of the Birds of Uttarakhand’ said that the Finn’s Weaver is a bird found only in the Indian subcontinent and it has not been sighted in the past few decades.“This bird has been spotted after many decades in the state. There has been a continuous decline in the population of this bird in the past few decades. In the last couple of years, there has been no confirmed sighting and it had become very depressing but now a colony has been seen, which has come as a big surprise,” Mohan said.The updated checklist of birds in Uttarakhand which Dhananjai Mohan co-authored with Sanjay Sondhi, lists 710 bird species in Uttarakhand, an increase from the first detailed checklist in 2003 that had listed 623 avian species in the Himalayan state.Mohan added that Finn’s Weaver is found only in the Indian subcontinent; Uttarakhand, Kaziranga in Assam and Shuklaphanta region in Nepal.“This bird has a very patchy, small population in a few select places in the Indian subcontinent. There are many species of weavers found in India, but this is the most threatened species, unlike Baya Weaver which is found commonly. Traditionally Finn’s Weaver birds form nests on large Semal trees, but we still don’t know too much about this bird, which is why perhaps new discoveries are being made and the bird has been found nesting over reeds in a water body this time,” added Mohan.The Uttarakhand forest department along with the Wildlife Institute of India is monitoring the nesting process of the bird, taking steps to ensure that there is no disturbance and the breeding of the birds takes places successfully, “as this is an important step in the lifecycle of the bird”.Finn’s Weaver or Finn’s Baya (Ploceus megarhynchus) builds nests on tops of trees or in reeds. According to ornithologists, they breed from May to September and line the inside of their nests, unlike other weaver birds.Asad Rahmani, former director of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) said that the spotting of Finn’s Weaver is extremely rare.“Sightings of Finn’s Weaver are extremely rare and the current sighting is an interesting record as it has come from nesting sites. Along with Uttarakhand, there was a sighting in Bijnor region of Uttar Pradesh also and I hope the government will protect the areas where the birds were sighted. What is needed now is the protection of the habitat, as at most places nesting sites have been converted into housing colonies and almost over 90% of the habitat is gone…” said Rahmani.Rahmani added that around 1000 birds of Finn’s Weaver species is likely to be found across the world now.Abhilasha Singh, divisional forest officer (DFO) Terai Central forest division said that the sighting of these rare birds has come as a motivation for the forest staff.“The birds were sighted in the Rudrapur region of Terai Central forest division by our forest staff. As the bird is not found commonly and it had not been sighted in the past few years, this sighting comes as motivation for our forest staff. We had asked all our forest staff to report sightings of any birds similar to the Finn’s Weaver and that is how we learnt about it,” Singh said.Uttarakhand has rich avian diversity. Of the 710 species found in the state, 6 species are listed as “critically endangered” in the ‘IUCN Red List of Threatened Species’, 3 as “endangered”, 19 as “vulnerable” and 28 as “near threatened”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-pleasant-surprise-claim-experts-on-rare-sighting-of-finn-s-weaver-birds-in-uttarakhand/story-oJwCRLFewMEH57bQvhXmZI.html
27-06-2020||India||China’s Xi Jinping is a successor to dictator Joseph Stalin: US NSA O’Brien||US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien on Friday launched the Trump administration’s sharpest attack on Chinese government, comparing President Xi Jinping to Russia’s brutal dictator Joseph Stalin whose policies killed millions, and warning that the Chinese Communist Party was seeking leverage over individual Americans through propaganda and collection of their “most intimate data” via big Chinese companies that made huge investments and had even pressured Hollywood into self-censorship.Robert O’Brien, who described the foreign policy calculations of consecutive US governments towards Beijing as the US’ ”biggest miscalculation” since the 1930s, said China’s efforts to control the mind of people residing beyond its borders was underway. The communist party, he said, was using trade to coerce compliance with its diktats.While NSA Robert C. O’Brien has come out openly detailing the penetration of the Chinese Communist Party in the US, his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval - as president of the Delhi-based think tank Vivekananda International Foundation - had written a paper on the penetration of PLA intelligence in “enemy countries”. The NSA, in his paper accessed by Hindustan Times, had explained the structure of people’s Liberation Army intelligence and use of propaganda as a tool in democratic nations, an evidence of which the world is now recognising in the US, Australia, Canada, and Brazil.O’Brien said the Trump administration had started taking corrective steps and outlined six steps taken by the administration to curb the Chinese influence in the US. But he underlined that this was just the beginning.In his address to a group of people at Phoenix in Arizona, O’Brien underscored that there really was no difference between mega Chinese firms and the communist party in power in Beijing.“The Chinese Communist Party seeks total control over the people’s lives. This means economic control, it means political control, it means physical control, and, perhaps most importantly, it means thought control,” he said, according to the transcript released by the White House.O’Brien referred to the analysis by an Australian official that in Classical Chinese statecraft, there were two tools for gaining and maintaining control: the first is ‘wu’, weapons and violence, and the second is ‘wen’, language and culture. Chinese leaders have always believed that power derives from controlling both the physical battlefield and the cultural domain.The NSA cited several instances when China, in addition to propaganda, used trade to coerce compliance with its dictates. Like when Australia called for an independent investigation of the coronavirus disease, the Chinese Communist Party threatened to stop buying Australian agricultural products.O’Brien added that the Chinese reach extends to heads of international organisations who are not themselves Chinese officials.China, he said, heads 4 out of 15 UN specialised agencies, more than the US, the UK, France and Russia, the other members of the permanent members of the UN Security Council, combined. He alleged that China uses these leaders to force the international bodies to parrot Beijing’s talking points and to install Chinese telecommunications equipment in their facilities.For example, since Zhao Houlin of the International Telecommunications Union took his post, he began to aggressively promote Huawei sales. Secretary-General Fang Liu of the International Civil Aviation Organisation has blocked Taiwan’s participation in General Assembly meetings and covered up a Chinese hack of the organisation. The CPC has used China’s membership on the UN Human Rights Council to prevent criticism of its abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, he said.Outlining how the CCP’s strategy could touch American lives, he said the CCP was collecting “the most intimate data — your words, your actions, your purchases, your whereabouts, your health records, your social media posts, your texts, and mapping your network of friends, family, and acquaintances”.“The CCP accomplishes this goal, in part, by subsidizing hardware, software, telecommunications, and even genetics companies. As a result, corporations such as Huawei and ZTE undercut competitors on price and install their equipment around the globe at a loss. This has the side effect of putting out of business American manufacturers of telecom hardware and has made it very difficult for Nokia and Ericsson. Why do they do it? Because it is not telecom hardware or software profits the CCP are after, it is your data. They use “backdoors” built into the products to obtain that data,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-s-xi-jinping-is-a-successor-to-dictator-joseph-stalin-us-nsa-o-brien/story-IVMDe3D2OJPdLgHIje2jhM.html
27-06-2020||India||In life patience pays off: Azhar||After his first film got shelved, actor Azhar Khan had to wait for more than a decade for his debut film. And, the actor is glad that his wait was worthwhile as his film has earned a lot of appreciation by all.“It’s has been a long wait me, almost 11 years, but still my dream did come true,” said the Jhansi lad over the phone.Telling us more about what took him so long to arrive, he said, “I come from a political and business family. My grandfather was the mayor of Jhansi so it was obvious that someday I’d join our family business. My father wanted me to complete my MBA and then join him. I wanted to go abroad and during the prep time I joined college in Pune.” It because of his unconventional looks and long hair his friends suggested that he should actually try his luck in modelling. “I tried and got a few modelling assignments in Mumbai. Then I got a film offer, which was based on the Neeraj Grover murder case. That was 11 years ago but unfortunately the film couldn’t be completed.”A UPite by heart, Azhar feels in small town life and people are much easy and happy. “I have spent a major chunk of my life in cities like Pune and Mumbai and love the vibe of these cities but the atmosphere there is very competitive and your presence is short lived. So, making a mark is very tough for all. My city Jhansi and even Lucknow, for that matter, are completely opposite.” The wait for Azhar was long but fruitful. “Patience pays off! Like, in my case, where many of my contemporaries of that time couldn’t get many opportunities and took up different professions but I did hold on to get my debut film. After my film was shelved, I took up real estate business and it kept me busy and afloat. Else, many others go into depression in such state of affairs. It was in 2018 when I got a call for Ram Kamal Mukherjee’s directorial ‘Season’s Greetings.’ First, I thought it can’t be true but after meeting the filmmakers, I was actually all glad and happy,” he said.The film had actor Celina Jaitley Haag opposite him. “The film released on OTT and was well received. My character Usman was able to leave a mark. It made me a known face overnight resulting in numerous followers on my social media accounts. I am relived but now I want to just work. I am all upbeat about the new projects coming my way. Soon, things will be on a roll and it’s now or never for me. This is the time I want to make most of it and reach the stars.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/in-life-patience-pays-off-azhar/story-Gs2AFpfvELV4Uyl4LEL3VP.html

The bridge, crucial for supplying ration to the army and the ITBP men near the Indo-China border, had also cut off about 7,000 people living in various villages after its collapse.“We have built a new 120-feet long Bailey bridge in about five days of time after the collapse of the old one. With the new bridge, the connectivity to about 15 villages has also been restored from today morning at 11 am,” said PK Rai, a BRO official working in the area.Rai added, “The bridge has also made it convenient for security personnel to access their posts near the Indo-China border in Johar Valley area.”At the time of the bridge collapse, there was construction work going on for another bridge. On June 23, police booked the injured trailer driver for negligent driving and causing property damage on the complaint of a BRO official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bridge-collapses-near-india-china-border-new-one-built-within-5-days/story-d3gGiWT4TmiayfsSe7fXLM.html

We will have to be more alert and cautious. People of rural areas should not visit the urban areas in the district for next 15 days unless there is an emergency.” said Ganjam district collector Vijay Amrit Kulange.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.In the last 24 hours, Ganjam district reported 58 new Covid-19 cases including 13 policemen taking the tally to 1,195, out of which 811 have recovered and 375 still in various hospitals. So far nine people in the district have succumbed to the virus.Following the footsteps of Ganjam, the administration of Gajapati too decided to enforce complete shutdown in the district from June 28 to June 30 to contain the spread of Covid-19. Since the beginning of June, the administration in 11 districts including Khurda where cases are going up regularly, have enforced two-day weekend shutdowns.In Bhubaneswar, the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation has meanwhile announced compulsory 14-day institutional quarantine for those returning to the city slums from other Covid hotspots like Ganjam, Cuttack, Balasore, Gajapati and Jajpur. They will have to undergo institutional quarantine before moving into the slums, said Municipal Commissioner Prem Chandra Chaudhary.With 282 cases in the last 17 days, many of them home quarantine cases, officials said the institutional quarantine will be enforced strictly as social distancing conditions are impossible in slums areas. “Social distancing is not possible in slums because of high population density. In such a situation, asymptomatic people can spread the virus to many others,” he said.Similarly, in Puri town, where the nine-day Rath Yatra is underway, the district administration is going to impose a 48-hour curfew in the district from the night of June 30 to July 2 morning, said district collector Balwant Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covid-19-cases-rise-odisha-enforces-shutdown-and-quarantine-in-many-towns/story-Ar5F5y68KdWV7wavVBV12O.html

All these cases are basically referred to the railway claim tribunal and on case to case basis these claims and compensations are decided and there is a very well laid out procedure for that,” Yadav said at a virtual press conference.Hindustan Times had reported on May 30 that around 80 people have died in Shramik Special trains between May 9 and May 27, according to Railway Protection Force’s report. The Railways had clarified that deaths had occurred due to pre-existing ailments.The chairman also said that the ministry is yet to collate the final list of deaths on board Shramik trains.“As far as the list is concerned, basically this is a state subject and so many states are involved and all these cases handled by state governments and they only finalise the cases so all those lists are yet to be collated...so far we haven’t been able to get the information from all the states but all the state governments are looking into those cases and they will be able to share the information only when they complete all the investigation and come out with their final report,” he said. In an interview to HT on June 1, railway minister Piyush Goyal had said Railways has been transparent about deaths and insisted on compiling a list of them.“Some of the stories are sought to be portrayed as if people died of hunger or starvation. I can say with confidence that no one died of hunger,” he had said, adding that in long-distance travel, some deaths occur even in normal operations.To be clear, railways provides ex-gratia payment to victims of railway accidents under the Railway Act. The national transporter had in 2017 increased the compensation amount for the family of a deceased person to Rs 8 lakh. Compensation can also be sought under section 123 of the Act citing “untoward incident.” However, in other cases, a claim for compensation can also be sought through the railway claim tribunal.“Ex gratia is given for railway accidents caused by railways itself due to derailment or collision or any other fault. For cases of untoward incidents involving deaths or injuries caused mostly by passengers or people themselves either by trespassing or run over or accidentally falling from a train, usually no ex-gratia is given. People can claim compensation through the railway claims tribunal,” a railway official explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tribunal-to-decide-on-compensation-for-deaths-on-shramik-trains-railways/story-qknnJdxDHZGlM9IgetwOZO.html

The Sandesaras are being probed by multiple agencies including the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the income tax department as well.The ED team, which arrived at Patel’s 23, Mother Crescent bungalow at around 12 noon, spent the next eight hours questioning him in this case.When the ED team left his house, Ahmed Patel told a group of reporters waiting outside that the government was trying to divert attention from the Chinese action at the Ladakh border and the Covid-19 fallout by targeting opposition leaders. Today the Modi Government sent some visitors to my house pic.twitter.com/Lr2PFaIjUT“At a time when we have such a tense situation on the Indo-China border, China has grabbed our land and people are suffering due to mismanagement of Covid-19 crisis by this government, it is trying to divert the attention by targeting opposition leaders.

27-06-2020||India||Members of 3 communities get J&K domicile certificates||Members of the Valmiki Samaj, the Hindu refugees from erstwhile west Pakistan and the Gurkhas, got domicile certificates from the Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) administration on Saturday after years of being denied equal rights. Earlier, they were not considered as permanent residents in the erstwhile J&K, which was bifurcated into two Union Territories (UTs) – J&K and Ladakh – after the scrapping of Article 370 of the Constitution on August 5, 2019.“It’s a red-letter day for us. The first domicile certificate was given to Deepo Devi, who is 70 -years-old. She had retired from Jammu Municipal Corporation (JMC), as a safai karamchari (sanitation worker) long ago,” said Gharu Bhatti, a leader from the Valmiki community.“We’re happy to be finally considered as legitimate citizens of J&K. Our youngsters see a new ray of hope. Now, they, too, can become officers and get good state government jobs,” he added.Bhatti, however, took a dig at Kashmir-centric parties such as the National Conference (NC) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) for opposing the new domicile law.“These parties have been claiming from the outset that attempts are being made to change J&K’s demography. However, they were trying to turn it into a Muslim-dominated state for all these years. Be it Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah of the NC, or Mehbooba Mufti of the PDP, they never allowed us to enjoy equal rights,” Bhatti said.He lauded the J&K authorities’ move to hand over the domicile certificates that have “ended slavery by successive Kashmir-centric regimes”.The Valmiki community was brought to erstwhile J&K in 1957 from Punjab’s Gurdaspur and Amritsar on the assurance of the then Prime Minister of J&K, Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed, that they would be given permanent resident status and other privileges.However, for over 62 years they worked as sweepers (safai karamcharis), irrespective of their educational qualifications, because they were never considered citizens of the J&K.Labha Ram Gandhi, the chairman of the West Pakistani Refugees Action Committee (WPRAC), praised the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre for its humanitarian approach that helped his displaced community members to get respect and dignity for the rest of their lives.“Nothing was done to solve our humanitarian crisis. We were betrayed by successive Central governments and erstwhile J&K authorities. We were denied our basic fundamental rights, as the majority of the refugees are Dalits,” Gandhi alleged.Members of WPRAC have been ineligible for government jobs and admission to any professional course at a state-run institute.Most members of WPRAC had come from Sialkot in west Punjab during the Partition and are settled in Jammu, Samba and Kathua districts in the Jammu division.Sanjeev Verma, divisional commissioner, Jammu, organised a special camp on Saturday to handover 50 domicile certificates to members of these three displaced communities.Under the Domicile Rules, all those people and their children, who have lived in J&K for 15 years, or have studied for seven years and appeared in Board examinations (Grade X or XII) from a UT-based educational institution are eligible for the grant of domicile.Children of central government officials; All India service officers; officials of public sector undertakings (PSU); and autonomous body of central government; public sector Banks, officials of statutory bodies, officials of central Universities and recognised research institutes of the central government, who have served in the UT for 10 years are also eligible for the domicile status.Besides, all those migrants and their children, who are registered with the Relief and Rehabilitation Commissioner, will be granted a domicile certificate. Children of those residents of J&K, who reside outside the UT, because of their employment, business, or other professional or vocational reasons have become eligible for the grant of domicile status.West Pakistan refugees (WPRs), sanitation workers and children of Women married outside J&K, who were earlier deprived, are also eligible for a domicile certificate. WPRs were part of the parliamentary electoral roll, but not of the erstwhile state electoral roll. They will now be covered under the 15-year domicile rule or their children under the seven-year or class X/XII rule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/members-of-3-communities-get-j-k-domicile-certificates/story-nASMjhTUyd23jNz4C9nbQN.html
27-06-2020||India||UP cops hunt for 15 impersonators in Bihar who rigged constable recruitment exam||The special cell of Uttar Pradesh police has launched a manhunt for 15 impersonators from Bihar who allegedly helped candidates to be fraudulently recruited as constables, many of them in Varanasi.The UP government had conducted written exams for recruitment of 41,000 constables in June 2018 at 860 centres. More than three dozen impersonators (whom the police call solvers) were arrested during the exams.The lid was blown off the racket in December 2019 after a man was caught with a prosthetic thumb during a biometric verification process at the police lines in Varanasi.“His arrest exposed the nexus between solvers and employees of a software company who were committing fraud in the online verification process.

Later, it was forced to tone down the demand after the Centre made it clear that it will affect evacuation. At least three lakh more people are expected to return from the Gulf countries. Over one lakh people have returned since special flights began on May 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-begins-tracing-contacts-of-those-testing-covid-19-positive-in-tamil-nadu/story-BpUypxzgNJxS1mIw018MoL.html

Sama Madi, 45, and his 42-year-old wife Sukuri Madi of Pendalguda were found lying in a pool of blood when the police reached the village.“The couple was most likely hacked to death by their neighbour. We have arrested two people in this connection and the hunt is on for more suspects,” said Malkangiri SP Khilari Rishikesh. The officer added that the bodies had been sent for post-mortem.According to police, the murdered couple were blamed by one of their neighbours for a medical condition that he and his wife were suffering from and for the death of the neighbour’s 10-year-old daughter last year.There have been a number of killings in the state due to witch-hunting even though the government had enacted the ‘Odisha Prevention of Witch-hunting Act, 2013’ six years ago to tackle the issue. The legislation aims at prohibiting witch-hunting and other similar practices.Last week, three people including a woman, were hacked to death and two others were assaulted over suspicions of practising black magic in three districts of the state. A 30-year-old man beheaded a woman in Mayurbhanj district before walking into the police station with the severed head and in Rayagada district, a man hacked two elderly people to death.In another incident, a woman in Nayagarh district was molested in a kangaroo court while her husband was forced to put his hand in a can of boiling water as they were suspected of practising witchcraft.A 14-year-old boy in Malkangiri district was allegedly killed by a group of people earlier this month on the suspicion that he practised black magic that led to the death of 17 tribals over three months.Concerned at the rising number of witchcraft-related killings, state officials said an awareness campaign would soon be started in the district with the distribution of leaflets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tribal-couple-in-odisha-s-malkangiri-hacked-to-death-over-witchcraft-allegations/story-3qN1b0bizmjpHpAHxmLUVO.html

But in the state portal, the uploaded figure was 6,733 tests and 2,836 positive cases.“But during the inspection, it was revealed from the records available with the labs that the total number of tests done by them was 12,700 and the positive cases were 3,571. At one of the labs in a major hospital, the actual number of tests conducted was 3,940 but they uploaded only 1,568 tests and showed 475 as positive,” the director said.The inspection report submitted by the expert teams revealed that many of the labs were not taking safety measures such as the staff not wearing personal protection equipment (PPE), safety cabinets not being available and lack of proper hygienic conditions. The staff conducting the tests for Covid-19 has not been trained properly in RT-PCR testing.ALSO READ | Andhra’s Covid-19 tally crosses 10,000, Telangana expects same numbers soonThe report pointed out that some of the labs did not follow measures for quality control and validation of tests. “There is a suspicion that in some labs, pooled testing was being done, instead of individual tests. As a result, some negative cases were also shown as positive,” it said.It is also suspected that there is possibility of contamination of samples leading to high positivity rate because safety measures and protocols are not followed meticulously. The teams also observed that in some labs, the testing area was very congested, and hygiene was poor and equipment maintenance was not good.“Some of the labs were conducting tests for walk-ins, advertising that samples would be collected from different places in the city, while the government guidelines very clearly stated that only symptomatic cases and patients admitted in hospitals should be tested,” Rao said.The expert committees recommended stringent action against some of the labs for violating norms and not following guidelines. ICMR has also directed the Gandhi Medical College to conduct quality control tests for private labs, he said.When contacted, Suprita Reddy, managing director of Vijaya Diagnostics, a popular diagnostic centre in Hyderabad, said the inspection teams had not found any violations in its labs. “The teams were fully satisfied with the conditions and procedures we are following for Covid-19 testing,” she said.A top executive in another popular diagnostics in Hyderabad, who pleaded anonymity, admitted there could be discrepancies in the figures being uploaded in ICMR and state government portals. “This is basically because most of the time, their servers would be down and uploading of figures is difficult. There is a lot of clerical activity involved in it,” he said.He also said testing of samples of Covid-19 suspects was a cumbersome exercise and it depends on the place of collection of swabs – nose or throat. “Sometimes, there is a possibility of the samples testing negative, even if the patients are positive. It happens even in government labs,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-govt-finds-private-labs-violating-covid-19-testing-norms-issues-stern-warning/story-3smNZqCaNlQUCqwrDEdBHK.html
27-06-2020||India||In a pincer move, Gadkari, Nadda jab Congress over national security and ties with China||BJP president JP Nadda and former party president Nitin Gadkari launched a two-fronted counter attack on Thursday in response to Congress party’s continuous offensive against the Centre, primarily on the issue of Chinese incursions.While Nadda posed several questions including over alleged donations from Chinese Embassy to Rajiv Gandhi Foundation-- a trust named after the former prime minister of India and chaired by Congress President Sonia Gandhi—Gadkari questioned the party’s record on issues concerning national security.“Recall the history of the past 25 years, how many incidents of bomb blasts took place, temples were attacked, innocent were killed. Congress governments (in the past) had a habit of surrendering to terrorists,” Gadkari said while addressing party workers in Rajasthan from Nagpur over a virtual Jan Samvad Rally. He added that it was then easy for Pakistan to train and send terrorists to attack India.Referring to the current stand-off with China over the boundary issue at the Line of Control in Ladakh, Gadkari said India was not interested in usurping any other country’s land. “ We don’t want to appropriate any other country’s land, we don’t want to intrude into any other country’s territory. We have brotherly ties with Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh and we stand by them in any situation,” Gadkari addedEarlier, JP Nadda had held a press conference to question Congress’ alleged financial link with China and sought to know if that had compromised the decision making by Congress-led governments in the past.BJP chief JP Nadda keeps up attack on Congress, Sonia Gandhi“Rajiv Gandhi Foundation got donations from Chinese Embassy from 2005 to 2009. It received donations from tax havens of Luxembourg every year between 2006 to 2009. What does it indicate to you? NGOs and companies with deep commercial interests donated money to the foundation,” Nadda was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Earlier, Nadda had attacked the Congress over a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Chinese Communist Party and sought to know the nature of the MoU.On Saturday, he alleged the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation worked in close association with China Association for Internationally Friendly Contact.

27-06-2020||India||India reached 1 to 5 lakh Covid-19 cases in just 39 days. Experts tell why||It took 110 days for coronavirus infections in the country to reach one lakh, while just 39 days more to go past the five lakh-mark.Medical experts have pointed to the ramped up Covid-19 testing, now available more extensively and at a reasonable price, as a big reason for the spike in cases recently.Six days after recording four lakh infections, India’s Covid-19 tally went past the five lakh-mark on Saturday with the highest single-day surge of 18,552 cases, while the death toll climbed to 15,685, according to Union health ministry data.The Covid-19 caseload increased to 5,08,953, while 384 fatalities were recorded in the last 24 hours, the updated figure at 8 am showed.This was the fourth consecutive day when coronavirus infection increased by more than 15,000, while there has been a surge of 3,18,418 infections from June 1 till 27. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh are the top contributors to the rising tally.It took 64 days for Covid-19 cases in India to touch the (May 19) one lakh-mark from 100 cases, and another fortnight to cross two lakh cases on June 3. It took 10 days for the tally to touch the three lakh-mark and another eight days for the cases to climb to four lakh. The nationwide lockdown was first imposed on March 25 for 21 days in a bid to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. The lockdown was first extended till May 3 and then again till May 17. It was further extended till May 31.The lockdown is now restricted only in containment zones across the country and will continue till June 30. A large number of social, economic, religious and sports activities are currently allowed to function under what the Ministry of Home Affairs termed as ‘Unlock 1’.After the government initiated the unlock procedure to make-up for the economic cost of the lockdown, the Covid-19 cases started to gallop.Dr. Monica Mahajan, Director, Internal Medicine, Max Healthcare, said it is important to understand the reason for the exponential rise in cases.The numbers are doubling at such a fast rate due to factors such as the high reproduction number of the virus (the number of cases, on average, an infected person will cause during their infectious period), she said. Also, with the lifting of lockdown norms people’s behaviour has changed again as they are not acting as responsibly as before in terms of social distancing, and testing has become more liberal, Mahajan told PTI.She said the price of the test has come down and test kits are more easily available, so more cases are being detected.Noted city-based lung surgeon Dr Arvind Kumar said definitely a big reason for cases going up is increased testing.The percentage of people turning out to be positive from among those tested is also going up as due to lifting of the lockdown people have completely forgotten social distancing norms and are out on the streets with scant regard for the pandemic, said Kumar, who works at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), a cumulative total of 79,96,707 samples have been tested up to June 26 with 2,20,479 samples being tested on Friday, the highest in a day since the beginning of the pandemic.The government has ramped up its testing infrastructure across the country significantly with the ICMR validating around 1,007 diagnostic labs, of which 734 are in the government sector and 273 private sector.The per day testing capacity which was around 1.4 lakh on May 25 has been increased to three lakh per day now.Starting with one single laboratory, the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune and having 100 laboratories in the beginning of the lockdown, the ICMR on June 23 validated 1000th testing laboratory.The real-time RT-PCR is the gold standard test for detecting cases of Covid-19 and the average time taken is around 4-5 hours from receipt of sample to getting the result. It requires a specialised laboratory set-up because of which this test cannot be performed at every district-level lab which does not have molecular virology facilities, the ICMR said recently.Thus the TrueNat and the CBNAAT systems have also been deployed for diagnosis of Covid-19 in view of availability of customised cartridges.Besides, the ICMR recently also approved the use of rapid-antigen test for coronavirus infection that gives results in 30 minutes and has also advised carrying out rapid antibody tests only for surveillance purposes.India reported its first case of coronavirus infection on January 30 from Kerala.The number of active cases currently stands at 1,97,387 while 2,95,880 people have recovered and one patient has migrated.“Thus, around 58.13 per cent patients have recovered so far,” an official said.India is the fourth worst-hit nation by the pandemic after the US, Brazil and Russia.According to Johns Hopkins University, which has been compiling Covid-19 data from all over the world, India is at the eighth position in terms of the death toll.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-reached-1-to-5-lakh-covid-19-cases-in-just-39-days-experts-tell-why/story-NtfCo8QTrg9R16RAVbr3BO.html
27-06-2020||India||Kerala’s reverse quarantine worries elderly, calls grow for its dilution||Velayudhan Nair, 72, a retired Kerala government official, is really agitated these days. His monthly outings to the state treasury in Thiruvananthapuram to receive his pension have been halted as the state government has implemented reverse quarantine. Nair used the day as an opportunity to frequent his favourite eating joint, and meet old colleagues.“Last time when I went out a police officer told me next time he will book me. When I told him about my pension, he said these things have to be done online. I told him I am not a geek and he advised me to better learn it,” he said, adding his movements were restricted even though he followed all norms by using face mask, maintaining physical distance and using sanitisers to keep hands germ-free.“Deprivation of travel is almost like incarceration,” complained another elderly person, adding it is a double blow as they face discrimination in house and outside also.These complaints have surfaced after Kerala started implementing reverse quarantine, a way to isolate elderly from others to avoid catching possible coronavirus infection. Mental health experts and geriatric care activists say reverse quarantine should be voluntary not mandatory. They warned it is taking a big toll on elderly and the ruthless implementation will have to be diluted. They say some incidents of locking up of elderly were reported in the state and people from the economically weaker section are worst affected.“Reverse quarantine is not locking up elderly. We have given strict instructions and it should be done with full knowledge and consent of the people concerned. They have to be convinced it is for their safety,” said state health minister KK Shailaja, adding reverse quarantine is possible in houses where there are many rooms.One among other problems is separating the grandchildren from their grandparents. Each family member will have to do her role to minimise chances of bringing virus to the household and if elders are at home they will have to be extra cautious.“In reverse quarantine, there should be a mechanism to address emotional and social vacuum. We should be very careful while dealing with elderly population. There are possibilities of emotional breakdown and we have to address them,” said palliative care expert Dr MR Rajagopal. He said reverse quarantine is a double-edged weapon which will have to be used judiciously otherwise after Covid-19 there will be a number of emotionally distressed people. Experts working in coronavirus counselling centres say they do get maximum calls from elderly these days. “It is not isolation. It is a mechanism to protect them. This message will have to go to them. We have to ensure all their basic needs before they go in quarantine,” said Dr Soumya Raj, district mental health nodal officer in Ernakulam, adding they have an elaborate list of people belonging to high-risk group and that they are called regularly.The state government had barred those above 60 from taking up work under MGNREGA. However, after complaints from self-help groups, it raised the age bar to 65.More than 3 lakh MGNREGA workers are above 60 and 70 per cent of them are women, says the state social security mission. According to the 2011 census, 12.7 per cent of the 3.34 crore population in the state is above 60. But last year’s state economic review says 48 lakh people are above 60 years of age and out of these 15 per cent are above 80. A 2015 India population study says 1.85 lakh elderly people are staying alone in their homes in the state.Health experts say though reverse quarantine is a tried and tested procedure to protect the elderly, its mindless implementation will bring more repercussions. In Kerala, out of 23 deaths 20 are above 60 years. The ICMR study says at least 52 per cent of the dead in the country are above 60 years. Kerala was one of the states to implement reverse migration first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reverse-quarantine-not-locking-up-elderly-kerala-minister-after-complaints/story-4Fe6krsUlqLPuriVBtlz1N.html

But, due to lockdown and many initiatives taken by the government as well as a people driven fight, India is much better placed than many other nations. India’s recovery rate is rising,” Modi said.India’s death per million due to Covid is under 12 while the death rate in Italy was 574 per million,he said.India was much better placed than many other nations, Modi said and pointed that the figures in the United States, Spain, Britain and France were much higher than India.Lakhs of villages, home to almost 85 crore people remain almostuntouchedby the coronavirus, he said.“The people-driven fight has given good results so far,” Modi said, cautioning that people can’t let their guards down yet. “In fact, we have to be even more careful now.Wearing masks, following social distancing, avoiding crowded places remain important,” he said. Pointing out that the coronavirus is not only a physical sickness but a threat to the lives of the people, he said “It also takes our attention to unhealthy lifestyles. A global pandemic implies that humanity as a whole needs healing. Let’s do everything possible for further harmony and happiness on our planet.” Modi said the wheels of trade and commerce have to move even as the fight against the pandemic continues. “At the same time, we have to focus on economic growth and prosperity for 130 crore Indians.The wheels of trade and commerce have to move. Agriculture has to flourish. In the last few weeks, the government of India has addressed both short-term and long-term issues relating to the economy. From the sea to space, from the farms to the factories, people-friendly and growth friendly decisions have been taken,” the prime minister said. Conveying his birthday greetings to the Metropolitan and wishing him long life and best health, Modi said “Dr.Joseph Mar Thoma has devoted his life for the betterment of our society and nation. He has been particularly passionate about removal of poverty and women empowerment.” Modi said the Mar Thoma Church is closely linked with the novel ideals of St Thomas, the apostle of Lord Christ.It is with this spirit of humility that the Mar Thoma Church has worked to bring a positive difference in the lives of fellow Indians, he said. They have done so much in areas such as healthcare and education, he said. India has always been open to spiritual influence from many sources, the prime minister said, adding that the contributions of St Thomas and the Christian community are deeply valued. Modi said the church, which has played a role in India’s freedom struggle, was in the fore front of working towards national integration and had fought the emergency. It has also “worked to bring a positive difference in the lives of our fellow Indians.”  “The Mar Thoma Church played a role in India’s freedom struggle.The church was at the forefront of working towards national integration.Church fought the Emergency. It is a matter of immense pride that the Mar Thoma Church is firmly rooted in Indian values.The contribution of the Church has also been recognized at the national level,” Modi said.The prime minister said, “the Holy Bible talks extensively about togetherness” and urged the church to work together for the advancement of the nation. While the country was moving towards self-reliance, the Mar Thoma Church, in line with its values, will surely “rise to the occasion and play a key role” in India’s growth trajectory in the times to come, he said.Various programmes have been scheduled as part of the one-year birthday celebrations.The Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian church is believed to have been founded by St Thomas, one of the 12 disciples of Jesus Christ.The Thiruvalla headquartered churchin Pathanamthitta district is one of the oldest denominations of Christianity.The church has approximately over 1.6 million followers across the globe and has 13 dioceses||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/constitution-is-our-guiding-light-says-pm-modi-at-mar-thoma-church-event/story-KEVEKV3Af23vCvXhtVLP2L.html

It is also watching the time taken by the PLA to restore status quo ante as anything less would be an exercise in perfidy.Both the sides are engaged in a dialogue through diplomatic and military channels with India looking at physical verification of the PLA withdrawal before coming out with any positive statement. With the Darbuk-Shyok Daulat Beg Oldi (DSDBO) road complete, Indian Army engineers are now connecting patrolling posts with roads so that the capacity and capability of troops to respond to any unilateral action from across the border rises manifold.With China deploying surface-to-air missiles in Aksai Chin in May, the Indian side has also responded in the same fashion with long-range weapons placed all along the 3,488 km LAC. Besides China, the Indian Army is also watching the Pakistani posture in occupied Gilgit-Baltistan.Although many a western strategists have stated that India will take help of its key ally US in case the red flag goes up, the mood in the Narendra Modi government is to go solo with sufficient force deployed to repel any action of the adversary. The Indian military is deployed in air, land and at sea with submarines patrolling the deep ocean and ready for any deterrent action.However, national security planners are confident that better sense will prevail over PLA Commander-in-Chief Xi Jinping and Western Theatre Commander Zhao Zongqi as no conflict is one sided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-waits-for-china-s-pla-to-disengage-at-ladakh-says-won-t-allow-a-new-normal/story-qqCFMq1SCROHOwfgUeNSYN.html

South and West districts have been put on high alert. We have also issued advisory to all district authorities to contain the spread of locusts, ANI quoted Delhi minister Gopal Rai as saying.District magistrates have been asked to deploy adequate staff to guide villagers and residents to distract the locusts by making loud noise by beating drums/utensils, bursting crackers, burning Neem leaves and other similar measures.

He again reiterated that the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF) got donations from Chinese Embassy between 2005 and 2009. “It is a sacrifice of national interest to accept money from foreign powers in personal trust. The country wants to know what transpired between the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and the Chinese government?” the BJP chief said during a virtual press conference. The BJP chief also claimed that the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation received donation from Mehul Choksi.“Why did you take donation in Rajiv Gandhi Foundation from Mehul Choksi and give loan to him? The country wants to know as to why the foundation took money from Mehul Choksi and what is the relation between Mehul Choksi and Rajiv Gandhi Foundation?,” Nadda asked party president Sonia Gandhi as part of 10 questions that he put to her and the party. On Friday too, the BJP chief had targeted the party and Sonia Gandhi in a series of tweets, saying “one family’s hunger for wealth” hurt the nation , and added that the Sonia Gandhi-headed trust had received donation from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) when the UPA government was in power at the Centre.However, dismissing Nadda’s charges, the Congress had said the the BJP was trying shift the focus from the Chinese issue. “The diabolical game of deception, diversion and disinformation is being played out by the BJP and JP Nadda to divert the attention of the country from the Chinese occupation of Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso and now Depsang up to the Y-junction, 18km inside the LAC,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said on Friday. On Saturday, Nadda added that the RGF received donations from tax havens of Luxembourg every year from 2006 to 2009. He also questioned why the RGF accounts were refused for CAG auditing and why the RTI was not applicable to the foundation.There has been an ongoing war of words between the BJP and the Congress for quite some time now –first on the issue of coronavirus situation in the country and lately , on the face-off between the Indian and Chinese troops at the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15. Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi has accused Centre’s Modi government of giving away Indian territory to the Chinese while Sonia Gandhi has said that the current crisis is a result of ‘mismanagement’ of the BJP-led NDA government and the ‘wrong policies’ pursued by it. In three video messages released back-to-back on Friday afternoon, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, son Rahul and daughter Priyanka stepped up attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the India-China border standoff and asked the government to take people into confidence on the extent of territories being occupied by Chinese troops.However, defending the central government, BJP chief JP Nadda on Saturday said that the armed forces are fully capable of protecting India, keeping the country safe and secure under Prime Minister Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-chief-jp-nadda-continues-attack-on-congress-sonia-gandhi/story-fyjREhsnfEDdMHdIAUbTuM.html

I have decided to devote the rest of my life for changing Bihar after the worst ever humiliation I have had to face due to heart-ending sight of migrants from Bihar returning to the state braving untold miseries,” he added.Flanked by former ministers in Nitish Kumar Cabinet Renu Kushwaha, Narendra Singh, former Jehanabad MP Arun Kumar, five-time MP from Jhanjharpur Devendra Prasad Yadav, former MP Purnmasi Ram, former union minister Nagmani and a host of other leaders, including Asfaq Rehman, Imtiyaz Ahmad and former MLA Sidhnath Rai, Sinha said more leaders were in touch with him to give the people of Bihar a viable alternative, “as they were badly looking for one after feeling cheated”. Former Bihar Speaker Uday Naraayan Choudhary is also said to be in touch with Sinha.“If this is the condition of Bihar 73 years after independence that every year 40-lakh people have to move out in search of livelihood, it speaks a lot about governance. If Bihar remains at the bottom of the human development index (HDI) index and poverty index, has the lowest per capita income of Rs 47541, which is one-third of the national average, and the education and health sectors remain in a deplorable state, there is not much left to explain,” he added.Himself an alumni of Patna Univeristy, Sinha said the university had been left with barely one or two teachers in several post-graduate departments, as most of the posts had remained vacant in Bihar’s higher education institutions. In the last fiscal, barely 33% of the rural road construction target could be completed. Bihar has barely 1.5% share in industries across the country. And to top it all, there is all-pervasive corruption, with money disappearing from treasury,” he said, in a direct attack on the Nitish Kumar government.He also urged the Election Commission to consider the prevailing situation before deciding whether it would be proper to hold elections. “Virtual campaigns and digital voting are mere tools of cheating the people. It will be heavily loaded in favour of rich parties. Besides, one never knows what shape Covid-19 would take. It may peak in October-November. Right now, there is hardly any testing in Bihar, but the figure has gone past 8,000. There will also be flood scenario in 21 districts. The EC has to take a call taking everything into consideration,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yashwant-sinha-throws-hat-into-electoral-battle-to-change-bihar/story-ams3PWs9FTH7nRQOGLuuzN.html

27-06-2020||India||Covid-19: As India records highest daily spike, Govt underlines recovery rate at 58%, mortality rate at 3%||While India created another unenviable record of registering highest single-day spike in coronavirus cases in the country with over 18.5 thousand cases registered in the last 24 hours, the Union health ministry on Saturday provided a more optimistic appraisal of the state of affairs in the country’s fight against Covid-19 pandemic outbreak.Health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan underlined India has 58% recovery rate from the disease, which translates to close to 3 lakh recoveries out of the total caseload of 5,08,953 recorded so far since the outbreak. His ministry also pointed out that India’s mortality rate due to the contagion was only 3% and the doubling rate was close to 19 days, a big departure from 3-days recorded before a nationwide lockdown was clamped in the country earlier this year on March 25.“Our recovery rate has gone above 58% and around 3 lakh people have recovered from COVID19. Our mortality/fatality rate is near 3% which is very less. Our doubling rate has come down to nearly 19 days, which was 3 days before the lockdown,” Harsh Vardhan was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also Watch | Covid update: 60% infections in June; notice over Coronil trials; PM lauds UP CM For Coronavirus Live UpdatesIndia is currently the fourth worst affected country in terms of total number of infections with the United States, Brazil and Russia faring even worse on that count. However, if one were to look at the total number of casualties, India ranks 8th on the list with Russia being the only country with fewer deaths but a higher number of cases than India. Death toll in India is at 15,685, according to the latest health ministry data released on Saturday.While the government has cited figures to show that the doubling rate has increased, it remains worrying that while it took 110 days for coronavirus infections in the country to reach one lakh mark, it took just 39 days more to go past the five-lakh mark on June 27. There has been a rise of 3,18,418 infections in just 17 days beginning June 1, according to data put out by PTI. The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19India still has 1,97, 387 active cases and the rising trend of the disease is showing no signs of abating. The silver lining comes from the relatively low fatality rate and high recoveries of patients, which stands at 2,95,880 as of Saturday. India is also 4th on the list of recoveries behind USA, Brazil and Russia as per data available on Worldometers.info. Experts have pointed out that a high recovery rate sometimes can be misleading as it can have a direct relation with a high number of positive cases in a territory. For example, the USA’s recovery rate is currently over 40% but it also has the most number of infections at 2,553,068. Brazil with 1,280,054 cases has even a better recovery rate of over 54%, which translates to close to 69 thousands recoveries, as per data available on Worldometers.info.India definitely ranks better than the USA, Brazil and Russia when it comes to total cases per million of population, while the USA has 7,714 cases per million, Brazil has 6,023 cases per million and Russia has 4,301 cases per million against India’s 370 cases per million, which is amongst the lowest in the world. On this parameter, India ranks 117th amongst the over 210 countries, affected by the virus.Experts, however, have said that this should be seen in the context of the total number of tests conducted per million of the population. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research, India has tested 79,96,707 samples up to June 26 with 2,20,479 samples being tested on Friday, the highest in a day since the beginning of the pandemic. Despite the increasing number of tests being conducted, India ranks 139th in terms of tests conducted per million of the population. India has conducted 5,795 tests per million of the population which is significantly low in comparison with other table toppers like the USA- 94,733 tests/million, Brazil- 13,766 tests/million and Russia- 128,140 tests/million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-latest-govt-highlights-58-recovery-and-3-mortality-rate-as-india-lists-highest-daily-spike/story-SuwefQuJ1vliA2mCBBoLUP.html

By triggering the standoff when the world is figting the coronavirus pandemic, China has exposed itself globally,” former Deputy Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen Gurmit Singh said.“The cost for China will be huge. It will be heavy. It will keep paying the cost for several decades for killing Indian soldiers in Galwan valley on June 15. China has lost its goodwill in India and elsewhere,” he added.Referring to brutal attacks on Indian soldiers in the Galwan valley, he said the action has reinforced the view that China’s People’s Liberation Army is “just a political” force and that it does not conform to military standards.Former Deputy Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen Subrata Saha too said China is getting itself isolated by its unacceptable military aggression and the country will have to pay a heavy diplomatic and economic price for it.“China is isolating itself by its aggressive conduct both militarily and diplomatically. So there will be a price for it. It is putting itself into a corner,” he said.Lt Gen Saha said there will a significant economic price that China will have to pay for its “misadventure”.He also referred to growing international concerns about what is happening in Hong Kong, South China Sea as well as in East China Sea.Gen Saha also talked about trade war between China and the US calling it a kind of “fight to finish” conflict. He also referred to China’s deepening trade crisis with Australia. The Indian and Chinese armies are locked in a bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for the last six weeks, and the tension escalated manifold after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash in Galwan valley on June 15. Following the Galwan vally clashes, the Army has sent thousands of additional troops to forward locations along the Line of Actual Control in various sectors including in Arunachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Sikkim.The IAF has also moved a sizeable number of its frontline Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar, Mirage 2000 aircraft and Apache attack helicopters to several key air bases including Leh and Srinagar following the clashes.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.Prior to the clashes, both sides had been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it was necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/galwan-clash-huge-mistake-by-china-world-already-fighting-covid-19-experts/story-Zhw1Hi0D18t24B3h86hCOP.html

With the advent of monsoon, the Indian side will need to evaluate whether the movement of pilgrims is possible through the corridor in a safe and secure manner, the people added.The Kartarpur Corridor, which links Dera Baba Nanak in India’s Gurdaspur to Durbar Sahib gurdwara in Pakistan, was opened on November 9 last year.The Pakistani statement said necessary health precautions are being taken regarding the corridor and the Pakistani side has invited India to work out standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the reopening. The statement also said the opening of the corridor on the eve of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak fulfilled a long-standing desire of the Sikh community and was appreciated by Sikhs across the world.The Indian government last year agreed to the opening of the corridor despite security concerns and opposition to a service fee of $20 charged from every Indian pilgrim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-reopens-kartarpur-corridor-next-week-india-seeks-experts-view/story-mOToSQdwRGlOIoQ2Ltgq3K.html
27-06-2020||India||For treating moderate to severe Covid-19 cases, govt adds dexamethasone||An inexpensive, widely used steroid dexamethasone was included in the treatment protocols for Covid-19 patients in moderate to severe stages of illness among other therapeutic measures by the Union health ministry on Saturday.The updated protocol includes the advice to use dexamethasone as an alternative choice to methylprednisolone for managing moderate to severe cases of Covid-19. The change has been made after considering the latest available evidence and expert consultation, the ministry said.According to the revised ‘Clinical Management Protocols for Covid-19’,  dexamethasone which is already used in treating lung infections besides in a wide range of conditions for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects can be used as an alternative to methylprednisolone which already existed in the treatment guidelines.  The health ministry on June 13 had also allowed the use of antiviral drug remdesivir for restricted emergency use and off-label application of tocilizumab, a drug that modifies the immune system or its functioning, and convalescent plasma for treating Covid-19 patients in moderate stage of the illness as an “investigational therapy”. It also recommended hydroxychloroquine in patients during the early course of the disease and not on critically ill patients.  The use of these drugs continues to be included in the revised treatment protocols under the ‘investigational therapy’.The revised treatment protocols for moderate cases advised considering methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 mg/kg or dexamethasone 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg for three days, preferably within 48 hours of admission or if oxygen requirement is increasing and if inflammatory markers are increased. The duration of administration should be reviewed as per clinical response.For patients having respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation, both non- invasive and invasive, the ministry said methylprednisolone 1 – 2mg/kg/day or dexamethasone 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg per day should be considered for 5-7 days in two divided doses, if not given already.“Note that a larger dose of glucocorticoid will delay the removal of coronavirus due to immunosuppressive effects,” the treatment protocols stated.The revised treatment protocols were issued as India’s Covid-19 tally raced past the five-lakh mark on Saturday with the biggest single-day surge of 18,552 cases while the death toll climbed to 15,685 with 384 fatalities, the updated figure at 8 am showed.   According to WHO, the corticosteroid dexamethasone was tested in hospitalised patients with Covid-19 in the United Kingdom’s national clinical trial ‘RECOVERY’ and was found to have benefits for critically ill patients.  According to preliminary findings shared with WHO, for patients on ventilators, the treatment was shown to reduce mortality by about one-third, and for patients requiring only oxygen, mortality was cut by about one-fifth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-adds-steroid-dexamethasone-in-covid-19-treatment-protocol/story-DA5jfbica6voMWrc08PTGI.html

He instructed the officials to put up a zig-zag barricade from Maidagin crossing to Godaulia and mark prominent circles on the ground to maintain a six-feet social distance for devotees while standing in a queue. Sanitiser cans would be placed at every 100 metres along the queue, he added.The temple authorities have been directed to hold a meeting with the members of the Yadav community called Yadav Bandhus and other people regarding tweaking of rules while performing the over two-century-old special puja during the holy month because of the viral outbreak.In a marked departure from the age-old tradition, only five persons would be allowed to perform the special puja on Shravan Mondays this year instead of the usual group of 100, Agarwal said.The authorities are also making arrangements for heightened security, uninterrupted power supply, and maintaining cleanliness in and around the ancient shrine during the holy month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-19-jhanki-darshan-for-devotees-at-varanasi-s-kv-temple-this-shravan/story-hbb76ACFUtSOujE6GNKisO.html

The protracted leadership debate in the Congress rolls even a year after Rahul Gandhi resigned from the top party post taking responsibility for the dismal show in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. As a stop-gap arrangement, Sonia Gandhi was then named the interim Congress president. She, however, continues to be so till date.  As and when there are elections ( hopefully soon) to the Congress Working Committee ( CWC), I am throwing my hat in the ring.

Several suggestions, including from Shashi Tharoor, to have an elected party president have been met with silence.Zoya Hasan, who taught at JNU and authored a book on the Congress, says there is a larger problem with the party. “I can’t comment on who is leaving or not leaving.

The basic problem is that Congress doesn’t have a full time president for more than a year which should be unacceptable at any time but more so when the ruling party has a strong leader and the leading opposition party has none. It’s odd for a party to have an interim president (Sonia Gandhi) and de facto president (Rahul Gandhi) but no full time president. No political party can function without a full time president.”At the CWC held earlier this week, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said the time has come for Rahul Gandhi to once again take over the reins of the organisation. A Congress leader familiar with the development said Gehlot’s suggestion was endorsed by former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat. However, no other CWC member spoke on the matter, he added.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala and general secretary in-charge of organisation KC Venugopal denied that the issue was discussed at the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sanjay-jha-to-contest-when-congress-decides-to-hold-polls-for-its-top-body/story-4FQjYJs2BCp4rhwbphiMbP.html
27-06-2020||India||Kar Seva, crowdfunding in VHP’s plan for Ram temple construction||The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Friday decided to involve people with the construction of the Ram temple in Uttar Pradesh Ayodhya by organising Kar Seva like the one carried out in 1992 and initiating crowdfunding. Around 27 VHP leaders assembled at Karsevakpuram in Ayodhya for the meeting during which several important decisions related with the Ram Temple were taken. Champat Rai, the VHP’s national vice president and also general secretary of Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust, also attended the meeting. “In the meeting, it was decided to connect Hindus with the construction of Ram Mandir. After much deliberation, it was decided that the only way to ensure this was by carrying out Kar Seva,” a VHP leader present in the meeting said.“We are waiting for directives from saints to start Kar Seva for the construction of Ram Mandir,” Ambrish, the VHP’s regional organisation secretary, said.The leaders decided that the steps will be carried out after the Bhumi Pujan at Ram Janmabhoomi. However, they said, Kar Seva will only be carried out when the coronavirus pandemic subsides.Another important decision taken at the meeting was to carry out crowdfunding for the construction of the temple.“There is no shortage of funds for the construction of Ram Mandir. But we want to ensure the participation of all Hindus in the construction of the Ram Mandir. We will ask for Rs 10 donation from every individual,” Rai said. The temple, the leaders decided, would be constructed according to the existing model which was approved by the VHP during the temple movement in the 1990s.Some saints had been demanding changes in the existing model.Suggestions by some saints to use marble from Udaipur and Makrana in Rajasthan for temple construction instead of carved stones lying at Sri Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas Karyashala in Ayodhya were also rejected. Vinayak Rao Deshpande, VHP’s organisational general secretary, and Dinesh who uses one name, the member of the management committee, were also present in the meeting among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kar-seva-crowdfunding-in-vhp-s-plan-for-ram-temple-construction/story-uQwzM6li7B40obZJbNJZNK.html

27-06-2020||India||Environmentalists object Chhattisgarh govt’s move to proceed with Bodhghat project||Environmentalists have raised objection to the Chhattisgarh government’s move to conduct a survey for the multi-purpose Bodhghat project on the Indravati river in a bid to provide irrigation facilities to farmers in the three Communist Party of India (Maoist)-hit districts of the Bastar region.The project, which is estimated to cost Rs 22,000 crore and likely to generate 300 megawatt (MW) of hydel power, seeks to construct a dam near Barsoor village in Dantewada district to irrigate 3,66,580 hectares (ha) of farmland in Maoist–affected Dantewada, Bijapur, and Sukma districts.The state government has entrusted the responsibility to conduct the survey, research and obtain requisite approvals from various ministries to WAPCOS Limited, a consultancy organisation and public sector undertaking (PSU) under the Union Ministry of Jal Shakti.Earlier, though the project had got the environmental nod in 1979 for the generation of hydro-power, when the area was still under an undivided Madhya Pradesh (MP), the work never got started because the then government had felt that the venture was not suited for the tribal-dominated people in the Bastar region.Now, the project has been modified into an irrigation project that aims to provide water to thousands of parched villages under the Bastar division.“The project’s survey started a few days ago. Earlier, it was conceived as a hydel project, but the state government stalled it owing to protests among the local tribals in the Bastar division over displacement and deforestation fears. It is being developed as an irrigation project. All necessary approvals will be taken afresh from the Central government,” said Ravindra Chaubey, state minister for agriculture and water resource.Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel held a meeting with public representatives of the Bastar region on June 20 to discuss the implementation of the Bodhghat project and also sought their feedback and opinion. “The CM told us that the people of Bastar have not been directly benefitted for all these years because of the setting up of any new industries and business ventures. However, this project will be a game-changer for the local tribal population,” said a tribal leader, who was present on the June 20 meeting, requesting anonymity.A senior Indian Administrative Service (IAS) official, who was also present at the meeting and privy to the development, said that the 300-MW generated from the project would be solely utilised for lifted irrigation, or a mechanised water flow, because the Bastar region has poor irrigation facilities.“Only 4.6% of farmland in the Bastar division has an irrigation facility. The region suffers from drought, despite dense vegetation. The Bodhghat irrigation project aims to cover 72% of arable land in Bastar in a major fillip to agriculture activities,” Choubey said. However, the project will also lead to a submergence of 42 villages and wipe out 5,704 ha of forests, 5,010 ha and 3,068 ha of private and government land, respectively.The bureaucrat said 500 million cubic metres of water would be used for Bastar-based industries.Activists working for tribal rights in Chhattisgarh said discussions about the projects must be done at gram-sabha level.“This is a welcome step that the government have started consulting with the public representatives of the Bastar region on the Bodhghat project. The gram sabhas and villagers should also be consulted,” said Alok Shukla, convener, Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan, a pressure group that was formed in 2009 and focuses on people’s issues in the mineral and forest-rich state.He cited that the project was stalled earlier because of fears over its adverse ecological impact.“It is the state government’s priority to provide irrigation facilities in the Bastar region, but it shouldn’t happen at the expense of the environment and the local tribal population,” he said.Manish Kunjam, a local Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader and also a tribal, however, claimed that the project is a non-starter, as it wouldn’t be able to provide irrigation facilities in the region.“The places that the state government seeks to make canals to irrigate the farmlands are inaccessible because of the Maoist insurgency and also the hostile terrain. No official has visited these areas after salwa judum (an anti-Maoist militia) because of the Maoist rebels,” said Kunjam.He demanded that the state’s tribal advisory committee should first approve the project because it is being constructed in tribal-dominated areas.Choubey said that CM Baghel has assured rehabilitation of the affected local tribal population and representatives of gram sabhas would also be consulted.“The displaced will getter better houses and land as compensation than their existing assets,” the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/environmentalists-object-chhattisgarh-govt-s-move-to-conduct-survey-for-bodhghat-project/story-A84b944V551TLZBCujKCtM.html

27-06-2020||India||Chidambaram tweets satellite image to attack govt over India-China border issue||Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Saturday used a satellite image to question the government over the border standoff with China in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley.The former Union minister’s tweet came a day after the Congress launched an online campaign, #SpeakUpForOurJawans, demanding transparency from the Centre over the alleged Chinese incursion into Indian territory. Twenty soldiers of the 16 Bihar regiment, including its commanding officer Colonel B Santosh Babu, were killed on June 15 at Patrol Point 14 in Ladakh during a clash with the Chinese army.The Congress party has raised the pitch and attacked the government for what it calls its silence over the border issue.“Spot the differences between May 22 and June 22, 2020 on the INDIA-CHINA border,” Chidambaram tweeted on Saturday.Spot the differences between May 22 and June 22, 2020 on the INDIA-CHINA border. pic.twitter.com/nLZzc3fjuQHe then turned his focus to Nadda, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s president, who had on Friday alleged that the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) donated money to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF) when the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was in power at the Centre. Nadda had, in a series of tweets, said “one family’s hunger for wealth” hurt the nation, and also accused the Congress of committing a “brazen fraud” by diverting public money into a “family-run foundation”. RGF is a trust chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi.“Mr Nadda, come to terms with reality, don’t live in the past that is distorted by your half-truths. Please answer our questions on Chinese intrusion into Indian territory,” Chidambaram tweeted.“Suppose RGF returns the Rs 20 lakh, will PM Modi assure the country that China will vacate its transgression and restore status quo ante?” he asked.“BJP President Mr Nadda specialises in speaking half-truths. My colleague Mr Randeep Surjewala exposed his half truths yesterday.”Before Chidambaram’s satellite image tweet, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had stepped up attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the India-China border standoff.They had asked the government to take people into confidence on the extent of territories being occupied by Chinese troops.Other senior party leaders such as Ahmed Patel, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Chidambaram, along with all Congress Working Committee members, party state chiefs and legislative party leaders have also issued videos. On its part, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been attacking the Congress for allowing even more incursions during their regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spot-the-difference-chidambaram-tweets-satellite-image-to-attack-govt-over-india-china-border-issue/story-chtdBYY4kT2hy3htfM531M.html

We have submitted a memorandum to the Governor as to what should be done for the farmers, women and other people during this time,” he added.CPI-M leader Ali Kishor Patnaik said that the 13 parties gathered for protest are anti-BJP and anti-BJD parties.The CPI-M leader said that the parties in the memorandum have requested the state government to act and “save the life and livelihood of the common people”.“There are many charges of corruption against the state government on the question of purchasing masks, sanitisers and PPE kits. Huge money has been siphoned and what we have demanded is that there must be a high-level independent community to enquire on this. The state government must come out with a white paper on the expenditure incurred to meet the challenges of COVID-19,” Ali Kishor Patnaik told ANI.Alleging that the state government a ‘propaganda-based organisation’, he said that the state government solely believes in propaganda.“This government has expertise in publishing and publicising things -- this is a propaganda based organisation. They believe in propaganda than in real and practical work. One must learn the art of propaganda from this government. Whatever they have announced, they are not keeping their promise,” he said.Citing the announcement wherein the state government promised to give Rs 2,000 to migrant labourers after completing 14-day quarantine period, Ali Kishor Patnaik alleged that the money has not been provided to the panchayat level.“Why are they not distributing the money? It has not reached the panchayat level. It is propaganda that Odisha is the first state to do so. Declaring that it is the first state is one thing but the reality is something else,” he added.AAP Odisha Convenor Nishikant Mohapatra said that the next six months for the people of the state is going to be very tough and he criticised the state government for “a lack of plan to scheme”.“The state government has no programme for people who are suffering. The Governor has appreciated our demand and has assured us that he would do the needful at this juncture,” he said.As per the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Odisha has a total of 5,962 Covid-19 cases in the state as of Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/13-opposition-parties-protest-against-odisha-govt-s-management-of-covid-19/story-ogEHktWqf1f9F9ncQsqJ1J.html

27-06-2020||India||Organised armed gangs challenging state government, Nagaland Governor writes to CM||Concerned about the ‘precarious’ law and order situation in the state, Nagaland Governor RN Ravi has written to chief minister Neiphiu Rio on how half a dozen armed gangs are challenging the legitimacy of the state government.In a scathing four-page letter written on June 16, which has been seen by HT, Ravi mentions how the armed gangs have been running extortion rackets and spreading fear while the state machinery had failed to rein them in.“Day-to-day unrestrained depredations by over half a dozen organised armed gangs, brazenly running their respective so-called governments, challenging the legitimacy of the state government without any resistance from state law and order machinery has created a crisis of confidence in the system,” the letter read.Also read: House-to-house Covid-19 screening begins in DelhiWithout naming them, Ravi, who was appointed Governor in August 2019 and is also the Centre’s interlocutor for the Naga peace talks, mentions about the Naga rebel groups, most of whom are engaged in peace talks with Centre.“Law-abiding citizens are made miserable by rampant extortion and violence by the armed groups. State government development departments are under duress to give regular ransom to the armed gangs. The brazen display of firepower by the rival gangs for turf control drive the people to panic,” the letter said.Ravi mentioned how the gangs operate check gates at entry points to the state and levy an illegal tax on all goods entering Nagaland “with full knowledge of the state law and order machinery”. Commodities coming to Nagaland become exorbitantly expensive due to “gunpoint” extortions by the armed miscreants.Mentioning how a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report in 2018 pointed out “massive leakage of funds” from various government departments to the armed gangs, the Governor stated that there was a steady downslide in all parameters of development in Nagaland due to the siphoning of a large chunk of funds meant for development projects.Ravi expressed disappointment that despite advising the chief secretary and the director-general of police in January 2020 to constitute a special investigation team (SIT) to probe instances of extortion and kidnapping of people involved in the construction of national highways in the state, no action has been initiated.The letter mentioned of rampant encroachment and deforestation of reserve forest land by the armed miscreants who had even evicted forest officials and their families from their residential quarters and were staying and conducting operations from there.Citing police reports, Ravi mentioned that while some action has been taken against foot soldiers of these gangs, senior members have not been implicated. He pointed that even in cases of the Arms Act and the Explosive Substances Act, where the minimum punishment prescribed is 5 years, the culprits are given 5-10 days sentence “often with the concurrence of the public prosecutor”.The Governor mentioned that despite raising these concerns with the chief minister and urging him to rein in the miscreants to restore rule of law, nothing has been done.“The scenario in the state is grim. The law and order has collapsed. The constitutionally established state government is being challenged on a day-to-day basis by the armed gangs who question the sovereignty and integrity of the nation while the instruments of law and order remain totally unresponsive,” the letter said.Ravi stated that in such a situation, he can no longer abstain from his constitutional obligation for law and order in the state and proposed that all important law and order decisions - like the transfer and postings of all officers entrusted with the maintenance of law and order of and above the district level - to be done after an approval from the Governor.“I also propose to periodically review law and order situation in the state and issue required lawful decisions. In order to instil and ensure accountability, I also prefer to review the annual performance appraisal reports of all such officers,” the letter read.The CM’s office has not given any official reaction to the Governor’s letter yet. Nagaland CM didn’t respond to calls and his office said no statement on the issue has been issued.The Nagaland government headed by Neiphiu Rio of the Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) was formed in March 2018. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is a key constituent of the ruling coalition.Following the Governor’s letter, the Nagaland Police held a press briefing in capital city Kohima on Friday to give details on relevant actions taken.“We would like to highlight anti-extortion measures taken against underground factions (of rebel outfits) and other anti-social elements who are taking advantage of such fragile situation,” said IGP (Range) Lima Sunep Jamir.“Since 2015, a total of 893 criminal cases have been registered and 1,238 persons of various UG groups have been arrested for involvement in various crimes including Arms Act, Explosives Act, murder, abductions, extortion robbery,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/organised-armed-gangs-challenging-state-government-nagaland-governor-writes-to-cm/story-C6YPQWz4xEHW46STBpCVDP.html
27-06-2020||India||BJP hits out at Kamal Nath for his alleged role in Congress-China ties||The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday accused Madhya Pradesh Congress president Kamal Nath of playing a pivotal role in Congress-China’s relations by exorbitantly reducing import duty on about 250 items when he was the union minister for commerce and industries during the UPA government.BJP national vice-president Prabhat Jha told the press that media had made a big disclosure as to why Congress and its leader Rahul Gandhi were speaking the language of China when there was India-China standoff at the border.Also read: Over 5 lakh people infected with coronavirus in IndiaJha said, “Former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh Kamal Nath played a key role in this. If I say in my own language that he was working as an agent of China, I will not be wrong… To reduce import duty on 250 such items which had an import duty of 100% to 200% and are available in India in plenty and thus the money received in return being given to the Congress party and Rajiv Gandhi Foundation is a national crime. The responsible person for this is the then commerce and industries minister Kamal Nath. This is all in records.”For instance, he said, the import duty on bamboo - which is available in India easily - was reduced to 10%. Similarly, on various items, it was reduced up to 40%. “That’s why Kamal Nath must answer to these charges. Otherwise, we will go to every locality to tell people why Rahul Gandhi was speaking the language of China what was Kamal Nath’s role in all this,” said Jha.Kamal Nath was not available for his comments. However, his media coordinator, Narendra Saluja, said, “Prabhat Jha is saying Kamal Nath ji worked as an agent of China when he was union minister. Jha should study Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s visits to China in September 2011 and June 2016. He should also look at Chouhan’s tweet on June 26, 2016, as to how he had pleaded for China’s assistance in development in the state and how he did special favour to China by giving land to Chinese companies in Peethampur. He should also remember that Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China four times when he was chief minister of Gujarat and five times as the PM.”Earlier, questioning the link between China and the Congress, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday alleged that both the Chinese government and the Chinese embassy in India contributed to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF) — a trust chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi with former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and P Chidambaram as trustees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-hits-out-at-kamal-nath-for-his-alleged-role-in-congress-china-ties/story-KMXHYT1brixPVgiQjRLkSO.html

27-06-2020||India||Serological survey to begin in Delhi today: All you need to know||Authorities in Delhi will start a mammoth campaign on Saturday to determine the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) amidst a rising number of cases in the national capital.The serological test or sero-surveillance study is a part of the new Covid-19 response plan prepared by the Centre for Delhi.Delhi, which has overtaken Mumbai as the worst-affected city in the country has 73,780 infections so far and 2,429 people have succumbed to the disease.Here is all you need to know about the serological survey:What are serology tests and serological surveys?A diagnostic method, serological tests are used to identify antibodies, which are created by the immune system when someone is infected with the virus, and antigens in a person’s blood. It may be performed to diagnose infections and autoimmune illnesses. It can also be conducted to check if a person has immunity to certain diseases.Serology (antibody) tests are largely used for surveillance among communities and can be used on people who have already been tested positive for the virus or even those who are asymptomatic.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageEpidemiologists often use serological surveys to determine who has antibodies and find out who has been infected with the virus, even if someone never reported a positive test or experienced symptoms. “Depending upon the level of seroprevalence of infection, appropriate public health interventions can be planned and implemented for prevention and control of the disease. Periodic serosurveys are useful to guide policymakers,” an official of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had said earlier.When will it be conducted?The serological survey will be done throughout Delhi between June 27 and July 10 to enable authorities to undertake a comprehensive analysis of Covid-19 and then prepare a broad strategy to combat the pandemic in the national capital.“As per the directives of HM @AmitShah, discussion was done on the serological survey in Delhi, which will be carried out jointly by NCDC and Delhi Government. Survey will begin from June 27, training of all the concerned survey teams was completed yesterday,” a home ministry spokesperson tweeted on Friday.Who will conduct the survey?The National Centre for Disease Control, under the Union health ministry, and the Delhi government will jointly conduct the survey that will focus on antibody-based blood tests to find out residents’ past exposure to the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19.Where will it be done?The sero-surveillance study will be conducted in all the 11 districts of Delhi focusing on as many as 20,000 households on a random basis, including individuals below 18 years of age.How is it done?A serological survey includes IgG Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) test. It estimates the proportion of the population exposed to Sars-Cov-2 infection. The IgG test is not useful for detecting acute infections but it indicates episodes of infections that has happened in the past. The test is approved by ICMR for its high sensitivity and specificity. Five millilitres of blood sample is collected from the subjects and then put in a machine where blood and plasma are separated. The plasma is then used to detect antibodies developed against Covid-19 in the body. Has it been done before in India?ICMR has in May conducted a pilot sero survey across 83 districts in 21 states. The results showed that the percentage of the general population to have been infected in the past was 0.73%, with urban areas having shown higher Covid-19 prevalence of about 1.09%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serological-survey-to-begin-in-delhi-today-here-s-what-you-need-to-know/story-21BcBryJVqX6ojgI1edHLI.html
27-06-2020||India||Delhiwale: The coolest guy in Khan Market||Cool people never say they are cool. They let others do the talking.This is precisely the case of Baldev. Enjoying a most enviable reputation in Delhi’s most upscale hang-out, he is known as the “coolest guy in Khan Market”. Or at least these exact words are glowingly painted on the wall just behind him.Baldev is a banana seller in Khan Market, since 1984. This morning, too, he is stationed by his pavement stall.Dismissing the flattering description on the wall, the turbaned (and masked) man shrugs, telling in a monotonous tone that “somebody came and painted that last year, or may be the year before that.”The gentleman has a poetic way of measuring time. This is how he discloses his age: “Do kum sattar (two less from 70)”.After the manners of truly classy and self-assured people, Baldev doesn’t feel the need to clothe himself in the opinions of others. He doesn’t think much of being considered “cool,” he says, but does modestly inform that shoppers often come to click his photos. He is popular, he suggests.In some sense, Baldev’s life is a mirror reflection of thousands of men who make their living in the metropolis as fruit vendors. Raised in the backwaters of Sultanpur, UP, he arrived in Delhi in the early 1980s and lives with two sons in a rented housing in south Delhi’s Kotla village. Every morning he gets a fresh stock of bananas from a warehouse, after which he pedals to Khan Market, where he stays until evening. The bananas are arranged picturesquely on his cycle, with a straw basket each placed on the handle bar and on the back carrier.Baldev recalls that he had originally chosen this area for his operations not because of Khan Market “but because the building over there used to have many government offices.” He waves his arm towards the multi-storey Lok Nayak Bhawan. “People working there were my customers.... they would come in great numbers to my stall throughout the day.”Most of those offices moved out of the building a long time ago, he mutters. “Now my customers are market people.”Soon, an auto rickshaw driver arrives to get a couple of bananas. After dispatching him off, Baldev turns to look at the painted words on the wall. “I usually stand across the road, but these days it’s hot… so I’m staying here in the shade.”He starts to readjust his fruit.You certainly ought to consider stopping by Baldev for bananas, but the more important reason to visit him is the fact that he is a living landmark of Khan Market — a destination so unique in the Capital that is as much loved (for its Partition-era origins, its longtime shops, its restaurants) as it is derided (for its so-called opulence and snobbery). The market has drastically changed its character over time, and also recently, with the closure of popular cafes and showrooms due to the coronavirus-related crisis. But it continues to hold on to its Baldev, who, along with a handful of shops, links Khan Market’s present to its past.You will find him in the market’s  periphery, where the middle lane meets St Luke Marg, next to a coffee chain outlet  that earlier used to be an Asian speciality restaurant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-the-coolest-guy-in-khan-market/story-yHp39cpbjTHrhhQPGEwybI.html
27-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know to today||Tamil Nadu on Thursday crossed the million mark in terms of number of Covid-19 tests. It was the first state to do so. That translates to around 15,000 tests per million of population (or 1.5% of the population), lower than Delhi’s 23,000+ and even Andhra’s 15,000+, but still among the highest in the country. The number is also much lower than that in some of the countries ravaged by the coronavirus disease — the US, UK, Spain, Russia, Italy, that have all tested between 8% and 12% of their population -- but it is still higher than the national average in India of around 5,834 tests per million of population.The state has rapidly increased testing. On June 11, it carried out only 16,829 tests. By June 25, this number increased to 32,543. And its daily positivity rate hasn’t changed much. This is a measure of the number of positive tests to the total tests, expressed as a percentage, and it has gone from 11.14% on June 11 to 10.78% on June 25. The lowest daily positivity rate for the state in this period was 7.21% on June 20, and the highest was registered on June 11.There are minor daily variations, but across a fortnight, Tamil Nadu’s daily positivity rate has hovered between 7.2% and 11.14%, with a median (middle) value of around 10%. And this, even as the number of tests have doubled.Tamil Nadu may well be the first state in India to be testing enough. Its positivity rate is following the trend (described previously in this column) — an increase, then a plateau, and then, finally, as a country, state or city begins testing adequately, a decline. Still better, the positivity range is exactly what the World Health Organization and experts at the Harvard Global Health Institute recognise as adequate.The chart accompanying this column shows the number of daily tests and cases and the positivity rate for the state for the past fortnight. Tamil Nadu recorded almost 71,000 Covid-19 cases till June 25, around 3,500 on that date alone. Of this number, 911 have died, and almost 40,000 recovered — a case fatality rate of 1.26% and a 2.22% death rate when closed cases (deaths and recoveries) are taken into account.The trend could change — as this writer has previously said, it makes sense to study one over a sustained period, say, eight weeks — but based on current evidence, Tamil Nadu seems to have got its hands (and more importantly, head) around the large-scale optimisation problem that is the management of Covid-19. The number of tests, cases, hospital beds, ventilators, health care professionals, people under home isolation, and volunteers, are all in the mix, and it is now clear that any district, city, state, or country that manages to crack this optimisation problem can get the better of the coronavirus disease.But even this level of testing may not ultimately indicate the prevalence of the coronavirus disease in a population. On Thursday, the US CDC said that only a tenth of the cases in the US may have been identified and recorded. That would mean around 10% of the country’s population was infected and mostly recovered without realising it (or died, in a few instances, without their deaths being recorded as Covid-19 deaths). CDC, news reports suggest, may have based its assessment on an ongoing serological survey that tests for antibodies in the population. Smaller tests of this nature have been carried out in various parts of the US (and this column has mentioned them, including the one in NYC), but this is the first large-scale antibody test.Interestingly, Delhi will become the first Indian state/city to embark on such a test on Monday, with 20,000 randomly chosen individuals from various parts of the Capital being tested for the disease.It is about time that happened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-to-today/story-Wcya4NnHezsRQgB1tVkJAP.html
27-06-2020||India||Punjab gets first woman chief secy, bureaucracy its first power couple||CHANDIGARH The ascent of Vini Mahajan, a 1987-batch Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, to the top bureaucratic position in Punjab is a story of many firsts. One, Mahajan is the first woman chief secretary of the state. Two, she is the wife of Punjab Police chief Dinkar Gupta. This is the first time a couple is holding the top administrative and police posts in the state, and perhaps the first time this has happened anywhere in the country. Gupta, a 1987-batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, was appointed as head of the state police in February last year. He was empanelled by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) last month for the post of director general or DG equivalent at the Centre.Three, this is the first time the chief secretaries of both Punjab and Haryana are women. In Haryana, 1983 batch IAS officer Keshni Anand Arora currently holds the top bureaucratic position. Anand Arora isn’t the state’s first woman chief secretary, though; that distinction goes to her elder sister Meenakshi Anand Chaudhary who was appointed chief secretary in 2005. Their sister, Urvashi Gulati, also served as the state’s chief secretary from October 2009 to March 2012.Four, in 1995, Mahajan was the first woman IAS officer to be posted as deputy commissioner (DC) in Punjab.An economics graduate from Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi, Mahajan also has a post graduate diploma in business administration from the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Calcutta, where she was placed on the ‘roll of honour’ and later also received the ‘Distinguished Alumnus Award’. She served in Manmohan Singh’s Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) from 2005 to 2012, handling matters relating to finance, industry, commerce, telecom and IT. Her father, BB Mahajan, was also an IAS officer of the Punjab cadre.Mahajan has been appointed as the chief secretary, superseding five IAS officers senior to her. They are: KBS Sidhu (1984 batch), Arun Goel, C Roul, Kalpana Baruah Mittal and Satish Chandra (all four from the 1985 batch).Sidhu, the senior-most bureaucrat in Punjab, is due to retire in July 2021. Both Goel and Roul are currently on deputation to the Centre and Mittal is additional chief secretary, cooperation, in the state government. Chandra, who has three months left for retirement, is additional chief secretary, home.Before being appointed as chief secretary, Mahajan was additional chief secretary, investment promotion, industries and commerce, information technology, governance reforms and public grievances. She served as the chairman of the celebrations committee for the 550th anniversary celebrations of Guru Nanak Dev in 2019. She succeeds Karan Avtar Singh who is due to retire on August 31, and who has been posted as special chief secretary governance reforms and public grievances. People familiar with the matter said Singh’s exit was largely because of differences with senior ministers in the state, including finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal. Mahajan will have more than four years as the chief secretary if she continues in the office till her superannuation in October 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-gets-first-woman-chief-secy-bureaucracy-its-first-power-couple/story-HOTxBL8CYUDeonkrc1pflL.html
27-06-2020||India||Over 5 lakh people infected with coronavirus in India||India’s number of Covid-19 infections crossed 500,000 on Friday, making the country one of only four where the tally has breached this milestone. Fatality and recovery numbers offer some signs that the outbreak is still under manageable levels, although experts warned that this control was fragile and the situation could drastically turn if citizens and the government are not careful.According to HT’s dashboard of state-level statistics, the total number of infections grew by 18,370 on Friday, and 383 new deaths were recorded. In all, the country now has had 509,306 infections and 15,689 fatalities, translating to a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 3.08%. Nationally, however, the total number of recoveries crossed 295,852 and -- on an average over the past week -- for every five people testing positive in a day, four were being discharged after recovery. In terms of total cases, Maharashtra continued to have the highest numbers – roughly twice of Delhi that has the second-most number of infections. Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh are the other states in top five. The states were ranked similarly if fatalities are taken as a parameter.According to experts, these trends could determine how the disease peaks, which is likely to be at different periods in different regions. “It will probably start peaking in the next few next few weeks in places like Mumbai and Delhi, but in other areas it may take a little longer time for the infections to stabilise. Herd immunity will take a longer period of time,” said Randeep Guleria, the director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, in an interview to HT.Guleria said in his assessment the country avoided being overwhelmed by going for an early lockdown, which helped create a gradual rise instead of a sharp surge of the kind seen in some early hot spot countries such as Italy.But the pace of the outbreak has still quickened. The latest 100,000 cases came in six days, compared to the eight days that it took for the 100,000 cases before that. “The surge was kind of expected, given our poor discipline in hygiene practices, it was too optimistic to believe that behaviour patterns will change in a few weeks. Masks and hand-washing are the way ahead as social distancing is difficult in densely populated areas, like urban slums,” said Dr V Ramana Dhara, additional professor, Indian Institute of Public Health, Hyderabad. India’s 509,306 cases is next only to Russia, Brazil and the United States – with the last two having crossed a million infections. In terms of absolute number of fatalities, India ranks eighth in the world.Italy, as an example of where the surge was overwhelming, has less than half the number of infections as India but more than twice the number of deaths. Among the top four, only Russia has been able to mitigate the pandemic more effectively than India, logging less than 9,000 deaths from among its over 620,000 cases.Brazil has roughly 2.5 times the number of infections as India but more than 3.5 times the number of deaths. The United States, now firmly at the top as the hardest hit by the pandemic, has five times the number of cases (over 2.5 million) and a fatality count that is a whopping eight times higher than India’s.The US saw a record number of new Covid-19 cases in a single day, with 37,077 reported on Thursday, according to the tracker maintained by Johns Hopkins University. Thursday’s tally eclipses the previous high on April 24, when 36,291 new cases were reported across the country.This, Guleria as well as Dhara, said was a good example of how things can quickly go out of hand if people do not maintain discipline. “The graph that was stabilising in the US is now going straight up, they had [close to] 40,000 cases in a day, the highest single day record. It is a classic example of people not realising their responsibility and whatever gains they had have now been lost,” Guleria said, adding that India must closely watch experiences of other countries to avoid making the same mistakes. “Unfortunately, there are very few good choices left, and neglecting them would be foolish — look at how the cases are exploding in Florida, Texas and Arizona in the US,” said Dhara, urging citizens to also ensure they do their part.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-tally-now-500-000/story-PmNfmanjXYkmWm9Y6SiWIP.html
27-06-2020||India||Delhi riots: Prez approves L-G’s list of 11 spl public prosecutors||New Delhi: Delhi’s home department has issued a notification regarding the appointment of 11 special public prosecutors (SPPs) for all cases related to the February riots in north-east Delhi after President Ram Nath Kovind signed off on the list approved by Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal. Kovind’s intervention was required after Delhi Police, which comes under the L-G, and the state’s elected Aam Aadmi Party government were locked in confrontation over the appointment of the special public prosecutors. While the L-G approved the panel of the public prosecutors proposed by the Delhi Police, the Delhi government rejected it and created its own. The L-G , on May 29, referred the matter to President Kovind for reference. In case of a difference between the state’s elected government and the L-G, the latter has to refer the matter to the President, whose decision is binding on both.Senior police officers said on condition of anonymity that the President gave his decision in favour of the L-G, after which a notification was issued on Wednesday (June 24), appointing the panel of SPPs proposed by the Delhi Police. HT has reviewed a copy of the appointment order.A media advisor to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the state government has to respect the President’s decision. “We opposed the move and demanded that an independent panel proposed by us be appointed. But now that the President has approved the panel recommended by the Police, the Delhi government has no option but to abide by the decision.” The L-G’s office did not respond to calls and messages seeking a comment on the matter.The notification, signed by Delhi’s deputy secretary (home) Pawan Kumar, says the appointment of the special public prosecutors has been done exercising “the powers conferred by sub-section (8) of section 24 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 (2 of 1974) read with the Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs notification...”It adds that the appointed SPPs “shall conduct all court proceedings including bail, trial, appeals, and all the miscellaneous matters incidental to and connected with all the FIRs which have been registered in respect of riots in north-east district (police district), Delhi or any other matter related to those FIRs).”The 11 appointed SPPs named in the notification are Manoj Chaudhary, Rajiv Krishna Sharma, Nitin Raj Sharma, Devender Kumar Bhatia, Naresh Kumar Gaur, Amit Prasad, Jinendra Jain, Anuj Handa, Ram Chander Singh Bhadoria, Uttam Datt and Salim Ahmad.“We have received the list of 11 special public prosecutors through the notification. They will represent us (Delhi Police) in the courts in the north-east Delhi riots cases,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Mandeep Singh Randhawa.The appointed SPPs will start appearing in the courts from Saturday( June 27), said an officer from the Delhi Police’s legal cell, requesting anonymity.A total of 53 people were killed and at least 400 were injured in the communal riots that ravaged several parts of north-east Delhi in February. Around 750 first information reports (FIRs) were filed and at least 1,300 people have been arrested in connection with the violence, prompted by clashes between two groups, one for the Citizenship Amendment Act and the other against. The clashes soon escalated into a communal clash between Hindus and Muslims. The police have thus far filed charge-sheets in nearly 100 cases. The confrontation between the L-G and the Delhi government over the appointment of SPPs began in April. A senior police officer associated with the investigation into the riots said the city police sent to the L-G’s office the list of a panel of public prosecutors. The L-G endorsed the police’s move and the file was sent to the Delhi government for perusal by home minister Satyendar Jain. The state government suggested that a panel of “independent and technically qualified” special public prosecutors to be appointed to represent the state. Jain formed a fresh panel of lawyers, and issued orders on April 16 that they be notified as the special public prosecutors.The Delhi Police subsequently withdrew its list and submitted a second list on April 24. This was rejected by the Delhi government with Jain reiterating his order of notifying the original panel suggested by him. Jain met the L-G on May 21, but the differences persisted. The L-G wrote to the government on May 23 and later invoked Article 239AA(4) of the Constitution (difference of opinion with the council of ministers) to refer the matter to the President.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-riots-prez-approves-l-g-s-list-of-11-spl-public-prosecutors/story-OgMJkCBQy4vpNrSdjR036M.html
27-06-2020||India||Children used by J&K terrorists, Maoists: US state dept report||Children as young as 14 are being recruited and used by non-state armed groups, or terror organisations, in anti-government activities in Jammu and Kashmir, according to a new report by the US state department. The Trafficking in Persons Report 2019, released on Thursday, also said children as young as 12 are forcibly used by Maoist rebels to handle weapons and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and in some cases, act as human shields, elsewhere in India. Maoist rebels also engage in sexual slavery in their camps, said the report.The use of “child soldiers” for propaganda is particularly rampant in areas affected by left-wing extremism (LWE) in the states of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, the report said.Claiming that India doesn’t fully meet the minimum standards in eliminating human trafficking, the US has kept the country in Tier 2 category of countries on the basis of its efforts to combat the practice . India has been placed in the Tier 2 category on human trafficking for almost a decade.To put things in context, the Tier 2 ranking is given to countries that have not fully complied with anti-human trafficking measures, but are making efforts to do so. Countries that have fully complied with the measures are in Tier 1. The report said physical violence against trafficking victims – in terms of both forced labour and sex trafficking – was prevalent in India and “some traffickers force women and girls to conceive and deliver babies for sale”.“Traffickers exploit millions of people in commercial sex within India. Traffickers target Indian women and girls but also fraudulently recruit significant numbers of Nepali and Bangladeshi women and girls to India for sex trafficking. Additionally, traffickers exploit women and girls from Central Asian, European, and African countries in commercial sex, especially in Goa,” the report said. “India is a source of child sex tourists and a destination for child sex tourism,” the report said.It added: “Traffickers kidnap and force Indian and Nepali women and girls to work as ‘orchestra dancers’ in India, especially in Bihar state, where girls perform with dance groups until they have repaid fabricated debts. Traffickers exploit women and children in sex trafficking in religious pilgrimage centres and in tourist destinations.”The report said human traffickers were increasingly using online technology to facilitate sex trafficking and fraudulent recruitment.“Some traffickers kidnap children from public places, including railway stations, entice girls with drugs, and force girls as young as 5 years old in sex trafficking to take hormone injections to appear older,” it said.Some corrupt law enforcement officers have a major role to play as they “protect suspected traffickers and brothel owners from law enforcement efforts and take bribes from sex trafficking establishments and sexual services from victims”, the report said. Not just that, the report noted that traffickers arrange sham marriages within India and West Asian states to subject females to sex trafficking.According to the report, the authorities have recently identified Indian forced labour victims in Armenia, Portugal, Gabon, and Zambia, and Indian female sex trafficking victims in Kenya.“Traffickers exploit Rohingya, Sri Lankan Tamil, and other refugee populations in sex and labour trafficking. Traffickers subject some boys from Assam, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh states to forced labour in Nepal,” it added.Criticising the Indian government, the US state department said the “the government decreased investigations, prosecutions, and case convictions of traffickers, and the acquittal rate for traffickers increased to 83%”.It added: “Law enforcement decreased victim identification efforts, and the government reported it had only identified approximately 313,000 bonded labourers since 1976 — less than four percent of NGOs’ estimates of at least eight million trafficking victims in India, the majority of which are bonded labourers.”It added: “NGOs estimated police did not file FIRs {first information reports} in at least half of reported bonded labour cases, and inconsistent with NGO reports, 17 of 36 states and territories did not identify any bonded labour victims in 2017 or 2018.” Citing data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the report said that in 2018, the Indian government reported 1,830 trafficking cases under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), a continued decrease from 2,854 cases in 2017 and 5,217 cases in 2016.The US report has a specific mention of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the sexual abuse of girls and boys in shelter homes in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.The CBI, the report said, completed investigations into the 16 most abusive shelters and filed charges in 12 additional cases. The CBI filed an additional 19 FIRs against some of the 94 other state-funded shelter homes in Bihar.“Despite this action in Bihar, the lack of investigations into suspected trafficking crimes and broader physical and sexual abuse of trafficking victims at government-run and -funded shelters in other states due to widespread negligence created an atmosphere of impunity for shelter employees and government officials to engage in trafficking,” the report said.The report blamed Indian police for the widespread impunity with which trafficking crimes are committed.“Some police and administration officials maintained the view that society had the right to put lower caste individuals in bonded and child labour, which sometimes impeded identification and investigation of such cases. NGOs across multiple states reported politically connected individuals, including local and state politicians who held workers in bonded labour in agriculture and on brick kilns, successfully avoided prosecution. Some law enforcement reportedly received bribes from sex trafficking establishments and sexual services from victims in exchange for alerting the traffickers of forthcoming raids,” it said.“The lack of sufficient political will across many states to address bonded labour stymied efforts nationwide,” it added.Prakash Singh, a former police chief of Uttar Pradesh, said: “The problem is definitely there. It is an acknowledged fact which has been accepted by the Indian government that Naxals {Moist rebels} use children for carrying items or even using them as informers.”Singh added, “Yes, Indian police have problems but they have a very thankless task to perform, where they have to follow orders of the political class. But I think Indian police are doing a better job than the US police.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/children-used-by-j-k-terrorists-maoists-us-state-dept-report/story-SMzUVKPCYSvopUk3z1HvSP.html
27-06-2020||India||CRPF trooper, 6-year-old killed in Anantnag attack||A six-year-old boy and a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) trooper were killed in a terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Anantnag district on Friday, officials said.In a separate operation in south Kashmir’s Pulwama, security forces gunned down three militants — believed to be from the Hizbul Mujahideen — and recovered arms and ammunition from the encounter site. A terrorist fired at a CRPF patrol team on a highway in south Kashmir’s Anantnag’s Bijbehara area around 12:15pm, a police spokesperson said.Zahid Daas, a terrorist of the Jammu and Kashmir unit of the Islamic State, was involved in the Bijbehara attack, Kashmir inspector general (IG) Vijay Kumar said later in the day. The police filed a first information report (FIR) against Daas.“... [the attack] caused injuries to a CRPF trooper and a minor boy. Both were shifted to nearby hospital where they succumbed to their injuries,” a police spokesperson said.The six-year-old boy who died in the incident was identified as Nehan Yawar, the son of Mohd Yaseen Bhat, a resident of neighbouring Kulgam district.Senior police and army officers reached the spot and launched an operation in areas adjacent to the highway. “An innocent six-year-old boy is the latest victim of the violence in Kashmir...May Allah grant him Jannat & his family strength at this difficult time,” former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah tweeted.In Pulwama district’s Tral, forces launched an operation at Chewa Ullar on Thursday evening after receiving intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists in the area.Officials said the first terrorist was killed early on Friday morning and two more were shot dead as the operation progressed. The terrorists, believed to be locals, were hiding in a house, which was damaged in the gunfight. IG Kumar said after the successful operation, there was no presence of the Hizbul, a local group, in the Tral area. “It has happened for first time since 1989,” he said.The police said the terrorists were given an opportunity to surrender. However, they fired indiscriminately on the search party, which retaliated, triggering a gun battle.The police said arms and ammunition including two AK-47 assault rifles, six AK magazines, five AK rounds, a pistol, a pistol magazine, and four pistol rounds were recovered from the site.The bodies of the three militants were sent to Handwara for conducting the last rites after medico-legal formalities, including the collection of DNA. Security forces have stepped up the offensive in Kashmir Valley and killed over 100 terrorists since the beginning of this year. Forty terrorists were killed in June alone, and most of them were killed in south Kashmir, which is considered the hotbed of militancy in the region. Among the major successes of security forces this year was the killing of Riyaz Naikoo, a top commander of the Hizbul, in an operation in Beighpora last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crpf-trooper-6-year-old-killed-in-anantnag-attack/story-cFLnltIeFopI3i3yH3wpeM.html
27-06-2020||India||SC accepts CBSE decision, okays new assessment plan||The Supreme Court on Friday accepted the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) decision to scrap the examinations for Classes 10 and 12 scheduled to be held from July 1 to July 15, and gave a green signal to the alternative assessment scheme prepared by the board. The results, based on the new scheme, will be declared by July 15. “As regards CBSE examinations, the CBSE has presented a draft notification for our consideration. After perusing the same and taking into account the suggestions given by the counsel appearing for the concerned parties, we see no difficulty in permitting CBSE to issue the said notification forthwith,” the bench, led by justice AM Khanwilkar and also comprising justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna, said in its order. The order was notified by CBSE on its website immediately after the conclusion of the hearing. Before Covid-19 forced the suspension of examinations, at least 23 papers were pending for Class 12 students [12 across India and 11 in northeast Delhi]; while the six pending papers for Class 10 were only for students in north-east Delhi schools, where communal riots earlier in the year forced the process to be pushed back. HT reported on the Friday that the assessments, under the new scheme for the cancelled papers, will work in the following way: If a student appeared for more than three subjects before the examinations were suspended, an average score will be calculated taking into account the three subjects in which the student scored highest. This will be allotted to the remaining subjects. For those who appeared in three examinations, the average will be based on the two highest scoring subjects and allotted to the remaining papers. For those who appeared in less than 3 exams, results will be calculated based on the marks in the appeared subjects along with their performance in internal/ practical/ project assessment. CBSE said it will also conduct an optional examination for Class 12 students -- in subjects where exams were cancelled -- when conditions become “conducive”. Students can opt to write this optional exam if they wish to improve the score secured based on the assessment scheme. Since admissions to higher education institutions are either based on marks scored in school graduating examinations or require pass percentage in such examinations, the CBSE’s scheme and the court’s order will now enable students to apply and seek admissions in higher education institutions in India and abroad, once the results are declared on July 15.Officials in the Delhi University (DU) on Friday said that they would consider the board’s alternative plan of evaluation for these subjects. After the CBSE halted the exams due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it came out with a notification on May 18 saying exams for the remaining subjects would be held from July 1 to July 15. This was challenged before the Supreme Court by four parents who submitted that their children would be exposed to Covid-19 if they were to appear for the exam. “The [CBSE] notification for holding of the remaining examinations and that too in the month of July 2020, wherein as per the AIIMS data, the said COVID-19 pandemic would be at its peak, is arbitrary,” the petition had stated. Solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta, appearing for CBSE, informed the top court on Thursday about the decision taken by the board to scrap the remaining examinations. He had also filed an affidavit setting out the assessment scheme. The court had then kept the matter for hearing on Friday for passing appropriate orders. The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), which holds the ICSE (Class 10) and ISC (Class 12) examinations, also accepted the suggestions of CBSE. The remaining ICSE and ISC examinations were scheduled from July 1 to 14, but have now been cancelled. Senior counsel Jaideep Gupta, appearing for CISCE, told the court on Friday that it will extend the choice of giving optional exam to Class 10 students in addition to Class 12 students. The ICSE and ISC assessment scheme (for calculating marks for cancelled subjects) will also be different for that of CBSE, and will be notified on the website of CISCE within a week, Gupta told the court. “Rest of the stipulations in the draft notification of CBSE, referred to above, are acceptable to ICSE in principle, which would be reflected in the proposed notification to be issued by the ICSE in that behalf,” the court said. “It is a historical moment. The Supreme Court by its intervention ensured that right to life of students is protected and I am thankful to the court for the same. Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures and I have to thank CBSE which did not treat this petition as an adversarial litigation. It came out with a pro-student scheme which could find use in future too”, advocate Rishi Malhotra, who represented the parents before the Supreme Court, told HT.Delhi Parents’ Association president Aparajita Gautam said parents are mostly relieved by the order since they were not in the favour of students appearing for their exams amid the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-accepts-cbse-decision-okays-new-assessment-plan/story-W93XsD8XkUiirAGwYxV8BJ.html
27-06-2020||India||Delhi Gymkhana Club: NCLT orders setting up of panel||New Delhi: The National Company Law Tribunal on Friday asked the government to appoint two nominees to the governing body of Delhi Gymkhana Club as well as set-up a five-member committee to look into the alleged “irregularities”, officials told Hindustan Times. The NCLT in its verbal judgment also said that the Delhi Gymkhana club, which is in the midst of a take-over battle by the Centre, will be allowed to make no “new policy decisions, appoint new members and/or begin new constructions”. The next date of hearing has been set at 7 September when the five-member committee will submit its report. Delhi Gymkhana president Lt. Gen. D.R. Soni (retd.) said that the “club will work with whatever orders are issued”. “We will do our best to follow whatever orders are issued, earlier restrictions have been continued,” Soni told Hindustan Times. “This a big win for the government as the interim orders addresses the concerns that were raised,” an MCA official privy to the developments told Hindustan Times. The Delhi Gymkhana, which shares a wall with the Prime Minister’s residence, has been under investigation for around three years. The central government has cited “parivarwaad” (nepotism), financial irregularities, misuse of allocated land and issues related to membership as the primary reasons behind its move to acquire the Delhi Gymkhana Club. The ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) filed a petition, seen by the Hindustan Times, with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking to take over the premier club.The government had asked for the dissolution of the governing body and the appointment of an administrator as interim relief. Not all feel that the order favours the government. A former Delhi Gymkhana official told Hindustan Times that the order was “neither a win nor a loss for either side”.“The order is primarily saying two things – one, that the administration of Gymkhana is allowed to continue,” said the former Gymkhana official. “The two nominees that will be appointed will be filing two vacancies. So basically NCLT has said that the government will fill the vacancies.”The former Gymkhana official added that the second point was that the NCLT is not yet “convinced of all the irregularities”, and has hence, asked the government to appoint a five-member team. “The team is investigative in nature, not administrative,” the former official said adding that the case was still “wide open” and “could go anywhere”. A Gymkhana board member, however, said that the order “was not exactly a positive for the Club”. “The governing council has been allowed to function, which is a good thing considering it is a democratically elected body,” said the official. “But we have to realise that a handful of people who hold a grudge against the Club have caused all these troubles.” The official added that there was no clarity on the mandate of the committee or the observers that the government has been asked to appoint. “We will have to wait for the written order to understand the nuances.” “As a member for last 49 years, all I can say is that this is not tenable in a court of law. The case has a weak leg to stand on. Once the Club lawyers receive a copy of the judgment, they will be able to respond better,” said Sameer Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-gymkhana-club-nclt-orders-setting-up-of-panel/story-0Mho65Uq1k7CYt6HTO1MaN.html
27-06-2020||India||Nath’s nephew booked for fraud, CBI raids premises||New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday carried out searches at multiple premises linked to Ratul Puri, his company Moser Baer Solar Ltd (MBSL), and his mother Nita Puri -- sister of former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath -- in connection with a fresh FIR registered against him on Thursday for allegedly cheating a consortium of banks led by Punjab National Bank (PNB) of Rs 787 crore, officials familiar with the matter said.The agency teams, wearing PPE (personal protection equipment), raided several buildings in Delhi and Noida.“In the view of Covid-19, all precautions regarding health and safety are being taken while conducting the searches including provision of PPE kits to all the search teams,” CBI spokesperson RK Gaur said.In the latest FIR, the agency has named Ratul Puri, his father Deepak Puri, mother Nita Puri, the firm MBSL, and six other directors – Bernhard Herrman Gallus, Sunita Mowdgal, Sanjay Jain, Rajesh Khandelwal, Deepak Khandelwal and Sunita Gupta -- as accused.Apart from PNB, Ratul Puri is accused if cheating six other banks -- State Bank of India, Union Bank of India, Exim Bank, Bank of Baroda, Indian Overseas Bank and Central Bank of India. He is also a key accused money laundering probe linked to the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper purchase scam.Ratul Puri was arrested in August last year and eventually released on bail in December.According to the latest FIR registered by CBI, as part of Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR), MBSL got a total Rs 955 crore from PNB for solar power project based on Amorphous Silicon thin film. A forensic audit carried out by the banks alleged that instead of repaying the of banks’ dues, MBSL invested a sum of Rs 695 crore in Helios Photovoltac Ltd, a related company of MBSL, which had been booking losses since 2011-12.MBSL also made an interest-free security deposit of Rs 135 crore to Moser Baer India Ltd (MBIL), said the FIR, said.Subsequently, the FIR alleged, MBSL fraudulently disposed of the primary security of the lenders -- consisting of stock of finished goods, semi-finished goods and raw materials -- to prevent he distribution among the banks.The banks have calculated the total fraud at Rs 787 crore, which mostly took place in 2013-14.Puri’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal declined comment. Former MP chief minister Kamal Nath last year accused the BJP of orchestrating raids by central agencies and claimed that the investigation against Ratul Puri was “political vendetta”.In August 2019, CBI registered a bank fraud case against Ratul Puri and Nita Puri 2019 for allegedly cheating Central Bank of India of Rs 354 crore.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) also accused Ratul Puri of involvement in bank frauds amounting to Rs 7,900 crore. In a charge sheet filed last October, ED alleged that Ratul Puri misused funds loaned from the bank to maintain a lavish lifestyle.The probe agencies have claimed that they had found printouts of emails that allegedly link Puri to corporate entities created to park money received as kickbacks in the AgustaWestland deal.The AgustaWestland case centres on allegations that bribes were paid to middlemen, perhaps even politicians, when India agreed to buy 12 AgustaWestland helicopters built by Italian defence manufacturing giant Finmeccanica (now known as the Leonardo group) at an estimated cost of Rs 3,727 crore in 2010.The deal was scrapped in 2014 over alleged breach of contractual obligations and charges of payment of kickbacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nath-s-nephew-booked-for-fraud-cbi-raids-premises/story-InxRkcackMWZptpOXknIRP.html
27-06-2020||India||Monsoon spreads across entire India||New Delhi: Monsoon covered the entire country by Friday, June 26 -- 12 days ahead of its normal pattern of spreading across India by July 8 -- due to a combination of weather phenomena, according to scientists from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The last time the advance of the monsoon was this early was in 2013, when it covered the entire country by June 16, In 2013, this happened as early as June 16.“There were three weather systems on Friday which helped the monsoon advance. Even the arid regions of west Rajasthan got rain, as did the remaining parts of Punjab and Haryana. There was a cyclonic circulation over central Pakistan, another over north-east Rajasthan, and a trough of low pressure was passing through Rajasthan, Haryana, right up to Bihar and West Bengal. This helped bring thundershowers and rain even in very dry areas,” said K Sathi Devi, head of IMD’s National Weather Forecasting Centre (NWFC).HT had reported on Thursday that the northern limit of the monsoon (the northernmost boundary up to which monsoon rains have advanced) covered almost the entire country on Wednesday except a few parts of Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab.“Thirty-one out of 36 subdivisions have received normal to large excess rain in June. Its good for sowing crops as June is the major sowing season for most parts of the country,” M Mohapatra, director general of IMD, said.Monsoon is said to have spread across the country when 36 subdivisions are covered.While the early advance is good news for the farm sector, scientists warned of intense rains in the eastern and north-eastern states for the next few days. There is a red warning for Bihar, Assam, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Sub Himalayan West Bengal and an orange warning for Arunachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, for heavy to extremely heavy rain on June 26 and 27. While a red warning implies that authorities should take actions to prevent any rain related disaster, an orange warning implies that all authorities should be prepared to act if there is a disaster.The heavy rainfall prediction, according to the scientists, is due to the shifting of the monsoon trough northwards, and the convergence of strong southerly and south-westerly winds from the Bay of Bengal over north-east and east India. “During this period, there may be a reduction in rainfall in northwest and central India. But starting from east UP to all eastern and north-eastern states and south peninsula will get very good rains,” Sathi Devi said.The larger features ensuring a good start to the monsoon are a neutral El Nino and a neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), the scientists said. El Nino is a climate pattern characterised by high sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean. El Nino years in India are linked to below-normal monsoon rains and a higher-than-normal frequency of heat waves. Last year, weak El Nino conditions prevailed, leading to a delayed onset of monsoon. IOD is characterised by warmer sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Indian Ocean, and positive IOD conditions are associated with normal monsoon over India.Monsoon progress was normal over south and east India, there was about a week delay over northeast India and 7 to 12 days early advance over central and northwest India according to IMD.A good monsoon, which accounts for 70% of India’s annual rainfall, is crucial for the agriculture sector, on which at least 700 million people in India depend on for livelihood. The monsoon is crucial for the yield of rice, wheat, sugarcane, and oilseeds in a country where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy but employs over half of its people.Monsoon over the country 21% in excess of the long period average (LPA) as on June 25 -- 12% over north-west India, 50% over central India, 7% over east and north-east India and 4% over south Peninsula.LPA is the average of rainfall received in the area over a 50-year period between 1961 and 2010 which is 88.06 cm.IMD has predicted a normal monsoon this year at 102% of LPA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-spreads-across-entire-india/story-ca4vdItilAQCP7GSeE1CKI.html

27-06-2020||India||IRCTC desk planned at Parliament house||New Delhi: Indian railway might stop serving Parliament canteens in the coming days, but the transporter’s catering arm, IRCTC, may soon open a ticket counter in Parliament complex—to help MPs buy air tickets of private domestic airlines.It is set to be the first outlet that will sell, among other things, tickets of different private carriers in the Parliament complex that had the presence of only public entities such as tea and coffee boards outlets, Indian railways-run canteen and an Air India counter. It will run parallel to the Air India counter, said a senior official. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla has given necessary orders to allow IRCTC to set up its booking counter, officials said. They also pointed out that in a special booklet highlighting achievements of Birla’s first year in office, it has been mentioned: “Orders have also been issued for setting up a new booking counter of IRCTC in Parliament House Complex to provide the facility of booking tickets for private air journeys by Hon’ble Members.”The idea to have a counter for all domestic airlines was mooted last year during a meeting of the Lok Sabha’s business advisory committee chaired by Birla. After several members pointed out the difficulties in getting tickets Birla asked the secretariat to look into the issue.An MP is entitled to 34 business class tickets annually in any airline. The entry of IRCTC may also dent Air India’s roaring business. According to officials and a couple of MPs, the national carrier’s counter provides mainly full fare tickets for the MPs—whereas buying tickets from outside or even agents can get lower rates.“I remember former Speaker Sumitra Mahajan once told us that she way flying from Delhi to Indore and she found that the passenger sitting beside her has bought the ticket at nearly 50% cheaper price,” said Trinamool’s floor leader Sudip Bandopadhyay who prefers to fly the Maharaja.The IRCTC outlet, according to officials can also end the inflated bills of travel agents who are often engaged by MPs as the lawmakers don’t have time to make their own bookings regularly. “according to rules, we have to pay for the entire amount of the bill. But some travel agents also add their commission,” said an official.“It will be a good move by the Speaker. After all, it will be convenient for all MPs to get their tickets during the session. and they don’t have to worry about the hassles,” Bandopadhyay added.Lok Sabha officials added that IRCTC counter is likely to open from the monsoon session. It might also coincide with the departure of the northern railways from the Parliament canteen as a part of the project to overhaul the catering system in Parliament.In last one year, the Lok Sabha secretariat revamped facilities for MPs in other sectors as well. 36 duplex flats for lawmakers came up in the North Avenue and another 228 new flats will be constructed.76 multi-storied residential flats are being built after demolishing seven bungalows located on B D Marg and one bungalow on the Talkatora Road. Birla has also set up an information and communication Center on the lines of a call centre for assistance of Members. The centre has received 21,000 calls so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/irctc-desk-planned-at-parliament-house/story-gcEplnRpVkOSyiOsdULD0I.html
27-06-2020||India||No talk of deferring Bihar elections at this moment: Sunil Arora||Chief election commissioner Sunil Arora, in an e-mail interview with Sunetra Choudhury and Deeksha Bhardwaj, speaks on the Bihar elections, how polling could change due to Covid-19, and on offering postal ballot facilities to those above 65 years and those in home/institutional quarantine due to the coronavirus disease. Edited excerpts:We saw a legislator found positive for Covid-19 voting in the recently held Rajya Sabha polls. Do you think it was a good idea? What are EC’s takeaways from the RS elections?Our electoral process has been inclusive and the commission always takes necessary measures to address any particular challenge so that it remains inclusive. Any elector found Covid positive needs to be facilitated, keeping the guidelines/instructions prescribed under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, in view for the purpose of voting without compromising on security, safety and transparency. Our polling team took all prescribed measures to facilitate voting of the elector (in the Rajya Sabha polls).Realising the changed environment, the commission on June 1 recommended to the ministry of law and justice amendments in the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, to facilitate postal ballot for electors who are 65 years and above, and electors who are under home/institutional quarantine due to Covid-19 (in upcoming elections).On June 19, the ministry notified the amendments, as proposed by the commission. This is in addition to the existing postal ballot facilities for PwD (persons with disabilities) electors and electors employed in essential services.Will these initiatives be carried into the Bihar polls? When the ambit of the postal ballot is expanded, how do you ensure the sanctity/ security of the vote?In 2019, the commission facilitated postal ballot for electors above 80 years and PwD electors in select constituencies in Jharkhand, and in 2020, in all constituencies in the NCT (National Capital Territory) of Delhi. In the NCT of Delhi, people in essential services also exercised their right to vote using the postal ballot option. All these categories are extended postal ballot facilities following due procedures, with proper video-recording of the process, and keeping candidates informed at every stage. Hence, each postal ballot vote remains secure, safe and transparent.Is it now certain that elections for the Bihar assembly will go ahead as planned?At the moment, there is no consideration of deferring the conduct of Bihar elections. Necessary preparations are underway at the Election Commission of India (ECI), the state and the district levels.In Bihar, approximately 71.8 million electors will be casting their votes in approximately 97,000 polling stations.How do you foresee elections changing during a pandemic?Covid-19 has impacted the electoral process world over. Definitely, restrictions and social distancing will impact electoral activities on ground. Keeping these in view, the commission is contemplating a number of measures such as:(a) Number of electors per polling station will be restricted to a maximum of 1,000 (as opposed to the current limit of 1,600). Thus, auxiliary polling stations (PS) would be created (for the additional voters); for instance, 34,000 additional PSs are being planned for Bihar.(b) Campaigning and outreach by political parties and even ECI’s Systematic Voters’ Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) efforts will need to shift to digital mode to a larger extent.(c) While ECI is ensuring that all ECI guidelines pertaining to electoral machinery, voters, political parties, candidates and other stakeholders are tweaked, a reassessment of procedures at various stages of the election is being worked out by a team.(d) All advisories and guidelines issued by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), under the Disaster Management Act...shall be adhered to.(e) Our field functionaries need to account for all related instructions of managing the issues of Covid-19 at each stage of the electoral process.(f) All stakeholders including political parties will have to collectively ensure that the relevant safety guidelines issued by NDMA and public health authorities are followed in letter and spirit to ensure appropriate arrangements regarding social distancing, sanitization, disinfection, and masks/gloves etc.How will the model code of conduct change and adapt to the new digital mode of campaigning?The Model Code of Conduct (MCC) has evolved over a period of time in close consultation with the political parties, as a successful code of ethical behaviour in Indian elections. MCC consists of two parts: first, behaviour/activities which are already covered/regulated under existing statutes; and second, behaviour/activities not covered by any statute.In case of the enforcement of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, to mitigate the dangers of spread of Covid-19, the concerned election authorities will ensure the implementation of regulating specific behaviour/activities, which relate to elections...The commission has already established mechanisms to monitor digital environment for elections. There is a dedicated social media monitoring section in the commission, which monitors popular sites and deals with complaints received regarding misuse of social media for electoral purposes during election period. Hence, with a proper monitoring mechanism in place, shifting of campaign to the online mode would not affect the implementation of MCC.Is the Election Commission considering voting via mobile apps and online?The commission has not considered the option of voting via mobile apps and online.The Election Commission has been considering the prospect of “remote voting” for a couple of years now. With lockdowns in various states, do we see a prospect of that materialising? If yes, who all will be eligible?The focus of remote voting is on those voters who, for a variety of reasons, are unable to exercise their franchise; who move from their places of ordinary residence for purposes of education, medical treatment or a temporary vocation. Similarly, a large number of overseas electors are unable to cast their ballot. ECI has set up a Technology Advisory group, drawn from academic experts from IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology) and other premier institutions to guide the commission on futuristic models for voting. They are actively engaged in simulating a workable prototype which can be tested for remote voting application. Fundamentally, it must meet the test of transparency, secrecy of ballot, security of data and network. A remote voting cell is being set up in ECI, which will have the mandate to consult various stakeholders and experts for brainstorming on the efficacy of technology. I am confident that we would be able to test...such a prototype over the next few months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-talk-of-deferring-bihar-elections-at-this-moment-sunil-arora/story-ECybXwyxkYwJb2PjVLzUEJ.html
27-06-2020||India||Mask is medicine until a vaccine is found, says PM||LUCKNOW Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked Indians on Friday to wear masks and maintain social distancing until a Covid-19 vaccine is not found, adding that the battle for ‘lives and livelihood’ would not stop until it was won.Speaking at the launch of the Atma Nirbhar Uttar Pradesh Rojgar Abhiyan” over video conference, Modi also attacked opposition parties over their handling of past crises while lauding Uttar Pradesh for its “hard work” in saving lives during the pandemic. “Go out for work but follow the two metre distance norm, put a mask on your face and maintain cleanliness to win the battle for lives and livelihood. We are not aware when we will get rid of Covid. But there is only one medicine. It’s maintaining two meter distance and wearing a mask. Till a vaccine is developed, we will be able to get protection ourselves with this medicine,” Modi said.The state job campaign, aimed at creating employment and infrastructure, is part of the ‘Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan’ that the prime minister launched on June 20 for 116 districts in six states. Thirty one of UP’s 75 districts are covered under the campaign.In his speech, Modi drew a comparison between the Covid situation in the state with that in some countries. “Take four European countries England, France, Italy and Spain. These countries have been super powers for 200-250 years. They are in a dominating position even now. These countries also have a total population of 24 crore. But 130,000 persons have died due to Covid there while only 600 persons have lost their lives in Uttar Pradesh… USA, too, is badly affected. USA has a population of 33 crore but 125,000 lives have been lost there. If UP had not prepared well it would have lost 85,000 lives… so by now Yogi government has saved lives of 85,000 persons.”He praised Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath for their handling of the crisis. “Can you imagine, his father died and instead of attending his father’s cremation he continued to work to protect you. I felicitate him,” Modi said, referring to the death of Adityanath’s father in April. “When other states are struggling to fight against Covid, Uttar Pradesh has launched such a big scheme for its development. The UP government is making use of every opportunity being created out of the crisis….We could not have imagined this achievement in situations that prevailed in UP before 2017,” the prime minister said, referring to the Bharatiya Janata Party coming to power in the state in the assembly elections three years ago. In his speech, Modi referred to the stampede at the Kumbh Mela in 1954, when roughly 500 people died, and indirectly criticised then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. “Thousands of lives were lost in Kumbh when an MP from Allahabad was Prime Minister. Those in government then tried their best to hide the number of deaths,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mask-is-medicine-until-a-vaccine-is-found-says-pm/story-cv8lPOeMYC9rucgReRgqfL.html
27-06-2020||India||2 of 3 ‘doctors’ in rural India have no formal medical degrees: Study||At least two of every three “doctors” in rural India are informal providers of care, with no qualifications in modern system of medicine, according to India’s first comprehensive assessment of public and private health care availability and quality, as measured by their medical knowledge.Although 75% of villages have at least one health care provider and a village on average has three primary health providers, 86% of them are private “doctors” and 68% have no formal medical training, found a survey of 1,519 villages across 19 states in 2009 by researchers from the Centre for Policy Research (CPR) in New Delhi. The study has been published in the Social Science and Medicine journal.The study supports the World Health Organization’s 2016 report on ‘The Health Workforce in India’, which had also found that 57.3% people practising allopathic medicine in India did not have a medical qualification, and 31.4% were educated only up to secondary school level. Also read: Sharpest single day spike of over 5k Covid cases takes Maharashtra past 1.5 lakh markThe CPR study found that formal qualifications were not a predictor of quality, with the medical knowledge of informal providers in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka being higher than that of trained doctors in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the study found.“For the vast majority of rural households, informal providers--usually called quacks-- are the only option that is locally available. Public health clinics and/or MBBS doctors are so few and far between that they are just not an option for most villagers. I knew that this was true of places that I had worked in (Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal), but had not realised that this generalised to almost every state, except Kerala. So the idea in health policy circles that as states get richer, informal providers will automatically vanish, is just not true in the data,” said lead author Jishnu Das, professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy and the Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, on email.The share of informal providers did not decline with rising socioeconomic status, though the quality of doctors improved. “If informal providers are counted as primary care providers, there is really no “shortage” of human resources.. Any strategy that does not account for the fact that most of our primary care is delivered by these providers cannot work at this moment,” said Das, who led the study called, ‘Two Indias: The structure of primary health care markets in rural Indian villages with implications for policy’.The study found no correlation between the average local availability of healthcare providers and state health indicators, such as child mortality, which indicates that though people in villages can choose among multiple providers, they still do not get quality health care.The massive variation in medical knowledge was closely tied to training, the study found. “The variation across states in the quality of an MBBS degree is huge, with southern states doing much better than those in the north. Because informal providers typically spend a few years with a formal doctor, either as a compounder or in some attendant function, their knowledge also depends on who they worked with. So, the quality of informal providers and MBBS doctors moves together,” said Das.The paper estimated informal providers account for 68% of the total provider population in rural India, with 24% of them being Ayush doctors practising traditional and alternative stems of medicine and only 8% having an MBBS degree.“The Covid-19 crisis has placed unprecedented demands on our health care, making it clear that we need to have an urgent discussion on how it needs to be structured moving forward. This crucial paper uncovers fundamental features of our rural health care system with key insights for regulation, training and capacity,” said Yamini Aiyar, president and chief Executive, CPR. India is divided into two nations not just by quality of health care providers, but also by costs, with better performing states provide higher quality at lower per-visit costs. This trend was consistent with significant variation in the availability and quality of medical education across state.Not much has changed since 2009, according to professor Das . “In all likelihood, the availability and type of human resources has not changed since 2009. We base this on smaller surveys that have been carried out in several states in more recent years, which show a similar dominance of unqualified providers in the private sector,” he said.What has certainly changed is the cost of private healthcare. “Training community health officers to provide free primary health care with tele-medicine support at health & wellness centres under Ayushman Bharat is a way out, but for similar training of informal providers in the private sector to work, we need safeguards to ensure they don’t further misuse the training and put the health and lives of patients at risk,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-of-3-doctors-in-rural-india-have-no-formal-medical-degrees-study/story-sKywKL1HG8aBQZTpKLShmK.html

27-06-2020||India||‘We need to improve monitoring at home’: Randeep Guleria||On a day India crossed 500,000 cases, Dr Randeep Guleria, director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi speaks about how early lockdown helped, what could have been done to help migrants and what lessons can be learnt from other countries. Excerpts: When will the pandemic peak? My own feeling is it that will peak at different times in different areas of the country, as we have seen in the US. It will probably start peaking in the next few weeks in places like Mumbai and Delhi, but in other areas, it may take a little longer for the infections to stabilise. Herd immunity will take a longer period of time. Rural India has the advantage of good social distancing, and in such areas, the cases will not rise dramatically and the numbers will come down. In the so-called hot spots with high population density, when (infections in) those areas get saturated, we will see the numbers coming down. In the so-called walled city in Delhi and urban slums like Dharavi in Mumbai, for example, this phenomenon is already being seen and numbers have started coming down. That is where the aggressive containment strategy comes into play, which includes testing, tracing and isolation.What did we get right? We implemented the lockdown early and that helped a lot. We were able to prevent a sudden massive increase in cases, as it happened in Europe. We had a gradual rise post lockdown, which gave us about two months to prepare our facilities. For example, from 10,000 tests day, we have crossed cross 200,000 tests a day now, from 100 labs, we now have 1,000 labs testing for Covid. Similarly, from a few isolation wards in select hospitals, we now have Covid hospitals, Covid care centres, dedicated ICUs, ventilators, oxygen, personal protection equipment, procured medicines... protocols are in place, doctors have been trained. All the systems could be put in place for pandemic preparedness.What could we have done better? The involvement of communities, social leaders and others for promoting the use of non-pharmacological methods, such as social distancing or wearing masks, for greater public participation in protecting themselves and helping contain infection. It’s unfortunate that despite such a large number of cases, people are still not realising their responsibility in terms of wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing. We could have better anticipated the movement of migrants and prepared a strategy to support them when they were in the city. This is also where social and community support comes in. What do we need to do better?We need an improved mechanism of monitoring people at home and rapidly shifting those who are ill from their homes to the hospital, and making sure hospital beds are available so that people don’t have to run from one hospital to another.Also, there’s need for aggressive testing, tracing and isolation to prevent an increase in the number of cases, house-to-house monitoring so people stay at home, and aggressive diagnostic testing and containment in hotspots so infection doesn’t spread to other areas. Why is it spiralling in some regions?After lockdown, we have not realised our responsibility in terms of taking measures to prevent the infection. People with mild illness go out and spread infection. Everyone who comes into close contact of a positive case must quarantine themselves even if you don’t feel ill as you may be pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic. If you don’t do that, you become part of the chain (that spreads infection). Cases are also spiralling in some regions because contact tracing was not done aggressively and people did not use protective measures enough, especially after lockdown was lifted.The graph that was stabilising in the US is now going straight up, they had 40,000 cases in a day, the highest single-day record. It is a classic example of people not realising their responsibility and whatever gains they had is lost. We need to see what is happening in other parts of the world and learn from that, rather than making the same mistakes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-need-to-improve-monitoring-at-home-randeep-guleria/story-N7ADiS1hbo6edBbLnUscOM.html
27-06-2020||India||Govt plans to double farm exports by ’22 to gain trade lead over China||New Delhi: In line with the “Atmanirbhar Bharat”, or self-reliant India, stance spelt out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in recent weeks, India aims to double farm exports from US$ 30 billion now to US$ 60 billion by 2022, scout new markets hit by Covid-19, and put China at a disadvantage in bilateral farm trade, according to details of consultations to “recalibrate” the country’s agriculture trade policy set in 2018. An interministerial assessment last week showed there’s room to export more to the US, Canada, Chile, Ecuador, South Korea, Malaysia, Iran, and to China and its rival Taiwan, an official familiar with the developments said“Having invoked three Ordinances this month to liberalise the farm sector, it’s time to scout for new markets and boost exports. India is an agricultural powerhouse. Good export can help achieve doubling of farm incomes, a target set by the PM,” the official said.New export hubs for horticultural produce – fresh fruits and vegetables – will be opened in smaller cities as part of the strategy to provide direct global access to local farmers, according to the plan being discussed, he added. The country has got market access for 35 agricultural products with eight countries this month. It will send out a few more over the course of the next few months, according to the plan.India has a trade surplus with China when it comes to farm produce; in other words, the country sells more commodities, in value terms, to China than it buys from the neighbour. “The aims is to widen this gap to India’s advantage,” the official said. To be sure, as a rule, as economies become developed, they sell more and more high-value manufactured items rather than farm-based products. In 2018-19, India’s total agri-based exports to China, from raw cotton to shrimps, stood at US$ 1.9bn, a rise of 117% over the previous year. In the same year, India’s total agricultural imports from the neighbour was $282 million. India framed a national agriculture trade policy for the first time in 2018. Officials said this policy needs to be retuned because of the global impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. According to changes being proposed, while India aims to export more farm produce to China, it will cut down on some. Officials have identified 11 farm-based items which China imports from other trading partners, which India also has the potential to export.These items will be put in so-called “potential exports to China” category, including maize, tobacco, tamarind, broken rice, coffee, cashew and pre-cooked meals. Bihar is one of the largest producers of maize. On other hand, Indian imports from China included commodities in which India is self-sufficient, such as bamboo, wheat gluten and apple juice concentrate. “A centrally sponsored scheme is currently on to promote bamboo products because of large plantations in the Northeast. We will now promote exports of bamboo products, rather than importing them,” the official said. Marine products will receive special policy attention, the official added.The country has concluded discussions on phytosanitary certifications for Indian mangoes with Iran.Phytosanitary certification is a formal declaration by an exporting country guaranteeing that shipments are free of pests and plant diseases, and meet the requirement of the importing country.Taiwan will allow exports of Indian lily bulbs. Canada has cleared Indian mangoes, grapes, pomegranate, banana, litchi, papaya, custard apple and okra for export. Chile has approved coconut fibre and walnut. South Korea and Malaysia, too, have agreed to buy Indian mangoes. Equador is the latest country to clear Indian rice.To give local farmers access to exports, India conducted trial international shipments of farm produce directly from Varanasi and Guwahati before Covid-19 struck. The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, in association with the farm ministry, identified 70 districts as potential export hubs. Shipments to Dubai from Varanasi contained chilli from Uttar Pradesh. Pineapples were sent from Guwahati and oranges from Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh. Smaller cities, like Varanasi and Guwahati, will now have complete infrastructure for exports, including phytosanitary certification.In a boost for mango exports, the US has agreed to shift pre-shipment inspection tasks to Indian plant quarantine authorities. The US has also agreed to bear the cost of these outbound inspections, which will bring down the cost of exports, a second official said. India is one the world’s largest growers of cereals, vegetables, fruits and the second largest grower of sugarcane. It is also the largest producer of milk. The government liberalised the farm economy through three ordinances announced on June 2. These aim to cut the government’s powers in deciding how much produce traders can store by amending the Essential Commodities Act, boost contract farming and remove rules requiring farmers to only sell their crops to licenced middlemen in state-notified markets. India’s agricultural exports grew five times from about $8.7 billion in 2004-05 to $42.6 billion during 2013-14. This fell to $33 billion in 2016-17. The country’s net exports (i.e. exports minus imports or the agricultural trade surplus) fell to $7.8 billion in 2016-17, falling a further 15 and 22 percentage points in 2017-18 and 2018-19. “Ramping up exports will call for a whole lot of infrastructure and relook of tariffs too. Also, our non-farm imports tariffs are around ASEAN levels, between 18-20%, but agricultural tariffs are still very high,” said Uma Kapila, an economist with the Academic Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plans-to-double-farm-exports-by-22-to-gain-trade-lead-over-china/story-uyHq0hjOAgyikk0gqU2BhO.html
27-06-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi’s core team has moved out as calls for return grow||If Rahul Gandhi heeds the call of some of his party people and returns as Congress president, relieving his mother Sonia of the responsibility of leading the 135-year-old party, the first problem he will confront is on the human resources front.The people nurtured and mentored by the 50-year-old as part of his core team have either quit the party or their positions since he resigned as president in May 2019, owning responsibility for the Congress ‘s general election debacle. State unit chiefs such as Ashok Tanwar in Haryana, Pradyot Deb Barman in Tripura and Ajoy Kumar in Jharkhand, have all left the Congress Party.Ajay Maken who was appointed Delhi chief in 2015, quit before the 2019 polls.Senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia switched to the Bhartiya Janata Party in March after a longstanding rift with former Madhya Pradesh colleagues, Kamal Nath and Digvijay Singh and the party central leadership’s hands-off approach to the crisis in Madhya Pradesh. And both of Rahul Gandhi’s appointees as Mumbai Congress chiefs, Sanjay Nirupam and Milind Deora, have stepped down from their posts. Rumours about them exiting the party refuse to die down, despite their own denials.So why did so many key team members leave in the 13 months since Rahul Gandhi called it quits?Nirupam answered with a question: ”Is it a coincidence that this is so or is there something of a bigger plan or strategy behind it?’’ The suggestion is that the team picked by Gandhi was sidelined by the old guard within the Congress party. In the ever-raging battle of the generations, his appointees stopped finding the support they needed to function in the party’s Delhi headquarters, one argument goes. “Those who are entrenched in the system help each other,’’ said Tanwar, who was picked as the Haryana Congress chief in 2019 and then quit the party in October last year ahead of the Haryana elections. “Rahul is a well-intentioned man who tried to build a new leadership and bring in new reforms and initiatives but once he left, there was no one who would listen to us.’’To be sure, none of those who left blame Gandhi “I think he is still the bravest and nicest guy to work for,’’ said former Indian Police Service (IPS) officer turned politician Ajoy Kumar, who quit as Jharkhand Congress head soon after Gandhi quit. He has now joined the Aam Aadmi Party. `After he resigned the protection needed to keep some not very nice people at bay disappeared. If he were there maybe they would not have succeeded in their designs.’’Pradyot Deb Barman ,who was the Congress’ Tripura chief, said he had quit because of it a total lack of direction. “There was no consistency in our policies. The old guard wasn’t supportive at all,’’ he said, adding, `”How could the Congress have a different view on the Citizenship Amendment Act in Assam and a different one in Tripura?’’ The Congress backed the NRC in Assam because of the original Assam accord but not in Tripura or other parts of the country.But there are others cosely associated with Gandhi who remain in the party -- for instance, the deputy chief minister of Rajasthan, Sachin Pilot , and new Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Satav. Pilot, who declined comment for this story, has managed to build his own base within the party in Rajasthan. And Satav rejects the theory that Gandhi built an all-new, all young team. ``If you really look, you will find that Rahul Gandhi got along really well with Captain Amarinder Singh and with former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah (neither of whom is really nxt-generation). So he pushed anyone who had the capacity to perform. He pushed 100 people and 10 may have left, but 90 are still there.’’Zoya Hasan, who taught at JNU and authored a book on the Congress says there is a larger problem with the party. “I can’t comment on who is leaving or not leaving. That’s been going on for a long time. The basic problem is that Congress doesn’t have a full time president for more than a year which should be unacceptable at any time but more so when the ruling party has a strong leader and the leading opposition party has none. It’s odd for a party to have an interim president (Sonia Gandhi) and defacto president (Rahul Gandhi) but no full time president. No political party can function without a full time president.“||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-s-core-team-has-moved-out-as-calls-for-return-grow/story-w3taJm706l6Fb4pAIEx9ZK.html
27-06-2020||India||PM Relief Fund money given to Rajiv foundation, says BJP||The Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) donated money to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF) — a trust chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi — when the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was in power at the Centre, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said on Friday, launching a fresh broadside against the opposition party in an ongoing war of words.In a series of tweets, BJP president JP Nadda said “one family’s hunger for wealth” hurt the nation, and also accused the Congress of committing a “brazen fraud” by diverting public money into a “family-run foundation”. His allegations came a day after the BJP said both the Chinese government and the Chinese embassy in India contributed to RGF.“PMNRF, meant to help people in distress, was donating money to Rajiv Gandhi Foundation in UPA years. Who sat on the PMNRF board? Smt. Sonia Gandhi. Who chairs RGF? Smt. Sonia Gandhi. Totally reprehensible, disregarding ethics, processes and not bothering about transparency,” Nadda tweeted.He also posted images of lists of donors to RGF for the years 2007-2008 and 2005-2006 to back his claim. The list included several state-owned companies, including the State Bank of India and GAIL, and ministries including the ministry of home affairs and the ministry of health. The Congress was quick to hit back after Nadda’s tweets, saying the BJP was playing a “diabolical game of deception” to divert attention from what it called “Chinese occupation” of Indian territory — a claim that came against the backdrop of a simmering dispute between India and China over the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).Twenty Indian Army soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops died in a brawl in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15, ratcheting up tensions between the neighbours amidst a military build-up on both sides of the disputed border. While the Congress accuses the government of ceding ground to the Chinese, the ruling BJP says the opposition party is playing with issues of national security.PMNRF was set up in 1948 by India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, entirely with public contributions. It does not get any budgetary support. PMNRF resources are utilised primarily to give relief to families of those killed in natural calamities, and to victims of major accidents and riots, according to its website.“One family’s hunger for wealth has cost the nation immensely. If only they have devoted their energies towards more constructive agenda. The Congress’ Imperial Dynasty needs to apologise to the unchecked loot for self-gains!” Nadda tweeted, referring to the Nehru-Gandhi family.“People of India donated their hard-earned money to PMNRF to help their fellow citizens in need. To divert this public money into a family run foundation is not only a brazen fraud but also a big betrayal of the people of India,” he said in a third tweet.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra, too, sought a response from Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, saying she was “no queen” and should explain the charges against her. Patra said PMNRF donated money to RGF three times when the Congress-led UPA was in power.Sonia Gandhi, as Congress chief, was on the board of PMNRF and also headed RGF, Patra said, alleging that she had “written the script of corruption in the country”.Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and P Chidambaram are trustees of RGF, which was set up in June 1991. The Congress said the BJP is trying to shift the focus from the Chinese issue. “The diabolical game of deception, diversion and disinformation is being played out by the BJP and JP Nadda to divert the attention of the country from the Chinese occupation of Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso and now Depsang up to the Y-junction, 18km inside the LAC,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said.In the statement, Surjewala pointed out that the BJP and the government “keep referring to a 2005 grant of ~1.45 crores received from Embassy of China to Rajiv Gandhi Foundation for the purpose (i) Disabled Persons Welfare Programme; and (ii) Research on Sino-India relationships”.He added that RGF accounts were duly audited and statutory returns were filed under the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA) to the Indian government. “This grant has been duly reflected in all filings to the income tax and the Home Ministry and no authority has ever found any wrongdoing of any nature,” the statement added.“Pursuant to the unprecedented Tsunami in the last week of 2004, RGF received a modest amount of ~20 lakh from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund in the Financial Year 2005 which was duly utilised to undertake relief activities in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands,” it said.On Thursday, the BJP — led by Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad —alleged that RGF pushed for a free trade agreement between India and China, leading to a huge trade deficit skewed in favour of Beijing. Prasad said: “There is a pattern as to why the Congress party does not condemn China because the 10 years’ rule of the Manmohan Singh government is littered with various evidence as to how the Congress party tried to support China and make it earn tonnes of money by permitting the increase of trade deficit 33 times.”Nadda alleged that RGF accepted $300,000 from China and the Chinese embassy in 2005-06 for conducting studies that were not in national interest. “There is a secret understanding between the Congress and China.”In its response on Thursday, the Congress said the BJP was engaging in diversionary tactics, questioned it on visits and exchanges between the BJP and the Communist Party of China (CPC) over the past decade, and alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared a “strange bonhomie” with China even as the borders were insecure.Political scientist Neelanjan Sircar said: “Given the outsized importance and competitiveness of Chinese businesses in the Asian business environment, every politician and bureaucrat has needed to engage with them — regardless of the party. That does not mean that anyone, BJP or Congress, has given preferred access.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-relief-fund-money-given-to-rajiv-foundation-says-bjp/story-UbqWm4SpHxUsziSb7uAcUJ.html

We must put our best efforts to ensure all precautions are taken. Please complete all rituals on time; Strictly ensure that only those tested negative participate in the rituals and the chariot pulling; I and PR (Information and PR department) must ensure the live telecast of Bahuda Yatra, Sunabesha, Adhar Pana and the Niladri Bije,” Patnaik said during a video conference with officials including those of Jagannath temple administration.Thanking the temple servitors, Sri Jagannath temple administration, police and district administration Patnaik said that the Rath Yatra was organised very well.The chief minister’s advice came at a time when the district administration and the Sri Jagannath temple administration have started testing each and every servitor involved in temple rituals apart from those who pulled the chariots on June 23, the day of Rath yatra.As per Supreme Court’s order, around 1,400 sevayats of the temple had pulled the three chariots from the main temple to Gundicha temple over a distance of 2.5 km. The idols will be taken back to the 12th century Jagannath temple in the same chariots on July 1.Puri district collector Balwant Singh said by the time the chariots are pulled back to the main temple, at least 8,000 persons involved with Rath Yatra would have been tested for Covid-19, some of them twice. “For a population of 2.5 lakh in Puri town, the number of tests that are being conducted is very high, around 32,000 per million population,” he said.“While close to 900 servitors were tested before the Snana Purnima festival on June 5, we got 1100 more servitors tested a day before Rath Yatra started to comply with the SC guidelines of only allowing those with Covid-19 negative reports to be involved in the festival. After June 23, we plan to test 6,000 more including policemen, all temple servitors, temple officials, sanitary staff and even electricity workers. We are re-testing the servitors who earlier tested negative and are staying in quarantine,” said Singh.The servitors who take part in Rath yatra do not normally step out or eat food outside. “This time we are taking additional precautions and had a discussion with Chhatisa Nijog, the apex body of the temple priests,” the collector said.During the Covid-19 test of the temple servitors on June 22, a 20-year-old servitor had tested positive. However, 40 of his primary contacts including 14 of his family members all tested negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-only-covid-19-negative-participate-in-bahuda-yatra-on-july-1-odisha-cm/story-4RKjRKhba4kL75n7EMtLMN.html

States make their choice as Covid tide continues to rise||As coronavirus cases in India are showing record spikes with each passing day and cases in most states are also demonstrating a rising trend, administrations are faced with the dilemma of either opening up activities further with the advent of second phase of Unlock beginning July 1 or of resorting to varying degrees of lockdown in an attempt to arrest the tide of cases. Some states like West Bengal and Jharkhand have decided to extend the lockdown till July 31, while others like Tamil Nadu have decided to selectively lockdown a few worst-affected districts.We bring you a sense of the mood in some states where a decision on the future course of action is being takenJharkhand- The state government has extended lockdown till July 31. However, a detailed order explaining what it entails is not available yet and the degrees of restrictions that will be placed in the state with 2,262 positive cases as on Thursday will be known soon.

27-06-2020||India||China, the common link between Ladakh and 3 US super carriers in the Indo-Pacific||Chinese military power and strategic attention is overwhelmingly directed towards the Pacific Ocean. Which is why Beijing’s military planners are presently dividing their attention between troop face-offs in Ladakh and three US aircraft carrier groups in the Pacific Ocean. The last time there were so many US super-carriers in the Pacific was three years ago because of North Korea. The US Indo-Pacific Command last month said all its forward-deployed submarines were at sea.The US naval deployment, while not originally motivated by events along the Sino-Indian border, has inevitably become part of China’s larger strategic calculus. Explains Vice-Admiral Anil Chopra, who just completed a term as the maritime expert on the National Security Advisory Board: The “movement of naval forces escalates things. Whenever you move them into an area of confrontation, it serves to send a message. The Chinese will worry about what the carriers can do, not what they necessarily will do.” Chopra says, “It has to be taken into account. That’s the main point of a carrier, it injects a degree of uncertainty.”While one carrier is off the US Pacific coast and another is near the Philippines, the USS Theodore Roosevelt has moved southwards to Vietnam. This location, says Mohan Malik, professor of strategic studies at the Pentagon’s Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, means that “in the event of a war, this carrier group would probably move to the Malacca Straits and the Bay of Bengal”.Also Read: China’s aggressive posturing turning relationship with India back to 1990sThe USS Roosevelt is a super-carrier, three times the size of an Indian or Chinese carrier, and its battle group would include accompanying cruisers, destroyer squadrons and submarines. “The US could deter the outbreak of a two-front war involving China and Pakistan on one side and India on other by dispatching an aircraft carrier battle group to the eastern Indian Ocean,” says Malik – if events were to spiral out of control. The unusual carrier deployment is a remarkable consequence of the Covid-19 epidemic.In March, viral outbreaks infected three US carrier crews. At one point , only one functional US carrier was left in both the Indian and Pacific Oceans. China began increasing naval and air force incursions into Taiwan’s airspace and tightening its grip on Hong Kong. The official WeChat account of Eastern Theatre Command of the People’s Liberation Army posted articles in mid-April calling for China to prepare for war.A Chinese scholar on the US, Wang Jisi, warned on a webinar the same month that hawks in China saw opportunities in the “US preoccupation in the election year and over the pandemic.”Concerned China might consider an attack on Taiwan, Washington ordered all three of its active super-carriers, now virus free, and at least eight nuclear submarines into the Pacific. Beijing warned Washington to “stop moving chess pieces around” the region and “flexing its military muscles around China.”This underlines the degree to which the US deploys its military with an almost single-minded determination to contain China. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday explained US troops withdrawing from Europe were being moved to tackle the threat China posed to countries such as India. His is the latest in a series of senior US official statements derived from the 2018 National Defence Strategy’s broad recommendation that US military power be directed primarily at China. US officials have privately told their Indian counterparts that one reason for their desire to leave Afghanistan is to divert the $ 50 billion-a-year US spends there to take on China.US Pentagon chief Mark Esper in February spoke of converting the 2018 strategy into a “new war plan” that would be completed this summer. The plan would integrate the assets of the four US military services in the Indo-Pacific. As Esper explained to Defence News: “A drone sees an enemy target, relays it to an airplane, an F-35, which relays it to a Navy ship, which either shoots it or relays it back to a Marine Corps long-range precision fire that’s island-based.” Esper called this a “big pivot point for us,” possibly recalling the original and militarily feeble “pivot to Asia” of the Obama administration.The US military’s biggest concern is its “missile gap” against China. The US was banned from testing or deploying intermediate-range missiles (500 to 5,500 km range) globally because of a Soviet-era arms control treaty. Exploiting this lacuna, China has deployed over 2,000 long-range missiles along its shore. The US has war gamed that, if forced to fight close to the Chinese shore, its military would be defeated. The Trump administration pulled out of the missile treaty last year and begun the rapid deployment of similar missiles along the Pacific. But Beijing knows it is secure against even a limited military engagement near the mainland for the next few years.It is likely that this has emboldened China and contributes to the recent aggression it has shown to a variety of countries, the most recent being India.“In the Cold War between China and America, India has emerged as a front-line state. China’s military pressure all along the disputed boundary is clearly aimed at the Finlandization of India. Beijing wants to deny India a peaceful environment essential to realizing its economic developmental goals that would narrow the power gap with China,” says Malik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-covid-19-and-us-aircraft-carriers-unbalanced-the-indo-pacific/story-dFhXsyDrYnibMIFmhMQ3WP.html
27-06-2020||India||Cooking to gym training, urban migrants did it all||Teachers, mechanics, cooks, electricians and gym instructors — migrant workers from myriad occupations -- have returned home in the past couple of months, skill mapping in different states has revealed, indicating how the pandemic has affected livelihood across professions and across regions.The skill mapping was conducted to roll out the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan, the targeted programme for jobs to migrant workers in 116 districts that have received at least 25,000 migrant workers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the programme from Bihar on June 20 via video conference.According to the union government’s initial estimate, about 7.5 million migrant workers have returned to their states of origin by buses and trains, but officials pointed out that the skill mapping exercise is on at a time when several migrant workers have returned through other means, and some are still on their way back to villages.The government’s initial estimate shows that different states have mapped a wide range of skills. UP has mapped its 3.4 million workers across 80 skill areas, while Jharkhand has classified its returnees in four broad areas based on their interest in livelihood. Officials added that more than 60% of the migrant workers belonged to construction industry in various capacities and the government hopes they can be effectively engaged in construction of roads, houses and other structures in the rural areas.“We have seen a wide range of professions among the returnee migrant workers. While about 30% or the largest group of migrants consists of unskilled workers in the construction areas, there are people from industries such as textiles, automobile, electricians, carpenters and agricultural workers who have returned,” said an official.Mechanics and carpenters comprise of about 10% of the returnees, and a large number of students have also returned to their home states, he added. “Some states have even identified at the micro-level and found out gym instructors, banking agents, mechanics, tailors and others who have returned,” said the same official.Also read | Social distancing goes for a toss at Delhi’s RML testing centreSo far, among the key districts, UP’s Siddharth Nagar and Prayagraj have received 160,000 and 104,000 migrant labourers, while Madhya Pradesh’s Balaghat has 102,000 returnees.Rajasthan’s Udaipur has seen 127,000 migrant labourers returning and Pali district received another 140,000 lakh daily wagers. Bihar has eight districts with more than 100,000 returnees; and Odisha’s highest number of migrant workers --125,000 -- have returned to Ganjam.The Union skill development ministry, along with the rural development ministry, is in touch with the states to get regular updates on the return of migrant workers, officials said.The Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan is confined to India’s 116 districts across Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha, but some other states also want their districts to be included. “Several states including West Bengal, Assam, Chhattisgarh are putting pressure on us to include some of their districts in this programme,” said a senior official of the rural development ministry, “but we don’t have any immediate plan to expand this list.”Also read | At Delhi’s shelter homes, inmates complain of no medicine while doctors battle multiple threatsThe skill ministry is also coordinating with the states with an objective to train 150,000 migrant workers under Short Term Training (STT) and another 150,000 in Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL).“The Centre has tried to resolve the migrant crisis in two ways-- by providing food grains and jobs. Although many workers look back at the opportunity to return to the cities to earn more, the Centre’s welfare package might have to continue for long. The government may also consider incentives for companies that take back migrant workers,” said Achiranshu Acharya, economist with Viswabharati university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cooking-to-gym-training-urban-migrants-did-it-all/story-fmnothYhndGUahKJo0BvAN.html
