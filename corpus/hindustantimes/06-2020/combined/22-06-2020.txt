One aspect of this could be that India will remove barriers within its internal markets to truly become a single market. It will remove the hurdles to efficiency improvements and become more competitive. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) was a step in this direction. Recent decisions to remove hurdles in inter-state agricultural trade are also similar. For agricultural and industrial products, as well as capital, India is increasingly becoming a single market. The creation of a barrier-free domestic market is also an intent reflected in Article 301 of the Constitution.However, there is one market where frictions are being added rather than reduced. This is the labour market. For different reasons, leaders from out-migration and in-migration states have made statements suggesting that there may be more impediments to the inter-state migration of workers. Some states have announced preferential treatment for workers from within the state. Others have spoken of instituting an approval system before allowing their workers to move to other states, in the backdrop of how they were treated.There are compelling reasons for internal migration in India.First, India has much higher economic differences across states than comparable countries — with the per capita income of the richest large state (Haryana) being more than six times that of the poorest state (Bihar). The wage gap between states is as high as 100% for regular workers and 250% for casual workers. It is, therefore, no wonder that workers from the poorer states migrate to richer states for work. As of now, the best option for many poor people looking to escape poverty is to leave the states they live in, because of economic opportunities in richer states. This movement is difficult since the cost of living is also higher in richer states. However, millions still migrate and brave squalid conditions in in-migration states because they need livelihoods.Second, some of the poorer states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have younger and larger populations, with many more workers than work opportunities. While these states must develop their economies, in the short-term, migration is an essential component of development for them.Third, India’s growth has been largely services-led. For most services, the availability of physical labour is essential. For services such as cooking, driving, hairdressing and security, there is a need for workers to be physically present to provide the service.While beneficial for migrants, migration also has negative implications. Migration can put downward pressure on wages in richer states, with the increase in the supply of workers. This creates an incentive for regional and local leaders to generate anti-migrant sentiments, and to promote policies that favour local workers. This dynamic is not very different from the one seen in international migration — after a point, a political economy develops to oppose migration.Throughout India’s history, states have enacted laws and measures that are discriminatory vis-à-vis non-resident migrants. Many state laws discourage or prevent non-residents from applying for government jobs or other professions that require government licensing (auto, taxi licences), or deny them the benefits of educational reservations. Other laws, prevalent in some states of the Northeast, regulate the entry of non-residents within the state. Yet another category of laws prevents non-residents from owning property (such as in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and others). The Union government has recently announced “One Nation One Ration Card” because non-resident migrants are currently ineligible for many state welfare schemes.Even though Article 19(1)(d) of the Constitution guarantees free movement and residence, states have enacted “reasonable restrictions” to disfavour non-resident migrants. Article 16 outlaws discrimination in employment on the grounds of residence, but the criteria for determining reservations is usually linked to local demographic characteristics. The courts have also largely upheld positive discrimination in employment and education that nonetheless discriminates against non-residents. They have upheld not just residency as a ground for eligibility for jobs and educational seats, but also the charging of differential capitation fees based on residency. In doing so, courts have generally privileged the equality interests in the Constitution at the cost of free movement and residence.While such measures ostensibly serve to protect local constituents, they inhibit migration and thus the law of comparative advantage from operating to the benefit of in-migration states. Bengaluru could not have become a hub for information technology if it had imposed restrictions on the movement of skilled professional migrants who eventually settled in the city. Contrary to nativist sentiments, Karnataka’s population has been a net beneficiary of this in-migration because of the increased contribution of Bengaluru to Karnataka’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) besides the value of diversity.This benefit is not limited to skilled or high-end services. To the extent that Bengaluru’s economy powers Karnataka’s growth, a migrant hairdresser working in Bangalore is also important for the state’s economy. This was evident recently when the Karnataka government wanted to prevent migrants from leaving for their home states because of their importance to the construction industry. It is, therefore, time to seriously re-examine the legal framework that inhibits the movement of migrants across the country, and prevents them from accessing safety, shelter and welfare services on equal terms as residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/don-t-discriminate-against-non-resident-migrants-opinion/story-gM32g5ka2zNtftYudbum8M.html
22-06-2020||News||Defending a historically undefined border line | Opinion||In my younger days, I led a couple of long-range patrols along the McMahon Line. One patrol was to go to Khang La, located on the watershed. We were late and lost a lot of daylight hours, but we pressed on to finish our task. We then strayed across the line by almost a kilometre. With no Chinese troops in sight, we divided our patrol into two teams and located Khang La only the next morning. As a young subaltern, this was my introduction to the Line of Actual Control (LAC). I later commanded the division on LAC in Arunachal Pradesh and then 14 Corps in Ladakh a few years ago. I have flown over the Galwan Valley several times. The ridge lines on the watershed are a maze with hardly any posts close to the line or any demarcation.The current boundary, LAC between India and China in eastern Ladakh, is an outcome of bloody battles fought in 1962 between the two countries in this most rugged and inhospitable of terrains. These battles were fought in October-November at Daulat Begh Oldi (DBO), Galwan, and Hot Springs, areas astride Pangong Tso lake, Razangla and Demchok. Due to severely low temperatures and high casualties, these battles came to a halt and the Chinese withdrew to their bases. Similarly, the Indian Army also moved back to nearby bases. Since then, both militaries are present there in the absence of a formal political boundary settlement. Twenty-two rounds of boundary talks have taken place between the two nations, without any worthwhile outcome. India continues to claim the entire Aksai Chin and China claims areas along a line, best described by India as the line of “Chinese perception”.The British left these boundaries un-demarcated. Its maps showed several lines, one running along the Kun-lun mountains, referred to as the Johnson-Ardagh line showing Aksai Chin as a territory within Jammu and Kashmir. Another is marked closer to the Karakoram Range described as the Macartney-MacDonald line and yet another line further west is called the Foreign Office Line. Post-Independence, these were left to the interpretation of stakeholders such as the rulers of Jammu and Kashmir, Tibet and the Indian and Chinese governments. Haphazard historical records, differing perceptions, and the machinations of cunning political leaders, left these lines to be deciphered by experts from both sides, albeit unsuccessfully. Meanwhile, the militaries of both sides have been left to hold ground that is divided by this history.While India published its map in 1954, with the international border (IB) showing Aksai Chin as Indian territory, the Chinese built the western highway through Aksai Chin in 1955 linking Tibet with Kashgarh and Xingjiang. With India’s claims as they stand, the Chinese would have considered it prudent to secure the area west of this sensitive highway. This was to be best achieved by dominating the ridge lines that run along the Karakoram Range between the watersheds of the Chip-Chap river and Galwan river, and then, moving further south-east along the ridge lines west of the Chang Chenmo Range. The Chinese concept of defending these areas is to keep the Indian forces at a stand-off distance from this highway. With the increasing ranges of artillery and surveillance resources, China seems desperate to push its claim lines further to the west. The Indian Army has a clear mandate to prevent any encroachment and alteration of LAC by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), not allowing the Chinese to unilaterally change the status of the boundary. The expression LAC was first used by Chinese Prime Minister Chou en-Lai himself in a letter to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1959.Today, the boundary in eastern Ladakh is over 800km with LAC being approximately 550km. Chinese patrols ensure they keep the passes off the watershed under domination so as not to allow the Indian troops to occupy the ground beyond. They continue to build tracks that generally emanate from the western highway and progressively move westward towards LAC to dominate the passes or crossing points. Hot Springs and Galwan are areas where both sides have been making roads and tracks. The Chinese have an advantage of terrain which is more open, plain and served by the western highway. Chinese patrols are fresh when they reach points of patrolling, often using centrally-heated vehicles.LAC has neither been surveyed nor marked on the ground. It is a line drawn with a thick pen on the map. This could translate into anything like 100 metres on the ground. A tent pitched a few metres this way or that way along this line can create trouble. However, the tents that the PLA erected along LAC was from where it can see straight into the Galwan Nala, leading to the sensitive Indian Darbuk-Shyok-DBO road and, therefore, unacceptable to India, just as the PLA is sensitive to Indian domination of the western highway. Since 1993, many agreements have been signed between the two countries to resolve such matters peacefully and according to laid-out protocols. The agreement of 1996 mentions that military means shall not be used while dealing with such border situations.In the absence of any boundary settlement, both sides have come face-to-face several times resulting in clashes, with recent ones being in 2013 at Depsang, Demckok and Chumar in eastern Ladakh. The incident at Galwan is a flashpoint of the worst kind in recent times. It can have serious ramifications when both nations have large conventional forces backed by nuclear weapons. Can the two countries afford to go to war that too when the world is reeling from the coronavirus pandemic? Why China would choose to display such belligerence at this time is open to a larger debate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/defending-a-historically-undefined-border-line-opinion/story-lwZvXdiZXQeZ4GCcKFRh1M.html
22-06-2020||News||Playing the long game with China | Opinion||The news of the terrible tragedy in the Galwan Valley on June 15, expectedly, evoked anger, sadness, and loathing in all of us. Within hours, however, the tragedy of the moment was sullied by a tragic-comedy of errors. In one instance, television anchors struggled to read an imagined list of Chinese casualties circulating on WhatsApp; in another, an apparently made-in-China television set was attacked with sticks — all for the benefit of a phone camera, that was, most likely, made in China. Before you boycott your weekly made-in-India Chinese meal, take a few minutes to read between the lines.This incident has changed the India-China relationship forever. This is the most serious engagement that the Indian military has had on the boundary with China since 1967. All guidelines and rules of engagement that were put in place since 1993 that dictated behaviour at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) now stand questioned.In this environment, what role do we play as citizens and consumers of information, especially at a time when operational and political reasons have dictated that information is sparingly made public? Here are a set of four questions we should examine to try and make sense of the developments.One, do we know what China will do? We do not. That is what makes the situation so complex and serious. Till last week, we proudly talked about how LAC is a disputed border where no bullets have been fired since 1975. The confirmed loss of 20 Indian lives makes the claim moot now.However, what we can bank on is the fact that States act rationally, in their own interest, to achieve their own goals. And, with almost no exception, they aim to spend the least amount of resources to achieve them. So, the question we need to ask is — what are China’s goals? Is it to merely occupy the Galwan Valley? Or is it to put India in its place and establish its superiority? The answers to this and more lie in the patterns of behaviour.Two, how, then, do we look for patterns? Contrary to how they are represented in popular culture, Chinese leaders are not inscrutable. Their actions are quite predictable, as long as one knows how to look for patterns in them. As journalist Shekhar Gupta has argued, there were signs since last year that an intrusion was likely. Many of these patterns exist in the pages of history. For instance, before believing that WhatsApp forward that lists names, purportedly of dead People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers, it would help to know that releasing casualty details is a sensitive affair in PLA that often takes years. For instance, there is still no definitive number of the total number of casualties in the Nathu La-Chola La standoff in 1967. How likely is it that the names of those dead in Galwan would be available?More such patterns exist, waiting to be read. The PLA’s statement on June 16 mentions causalities but neglects to claim that they were only Indian. This is as close as we are going to get for a confirmation, at least for now, that some of the dead were indeed Chinese. Similarly, read-outs of the conversation between the two foreign ministers use terms such as “peace and tranquility,” a nod to an earlier agreement for behaviour along LAC. This indicates that while the frameworks are under question, they are still allowing the two sides to converse.Three, where can we find factually accurate information? As Dhruva Jaishankar of the Observer Research Foundation has pointed out, information about developments at LAC are most trustworthy when they come from the government or military, in both countries, or through analysis of geospatial imagery. But when news comes from social media, it is prudent to verify it. Take the Chinese news outlet Global Times. The organisation and its reporters are very active on Twitter. However, Twitter cannot be legally accessed in the Chinese mainland, which suggests that their aim is to engage with readers abroad, in this case, India. This is most likely a part of State-sponsored psyops meant to misdirect, browbeat, or troll people while vigorously defending Chinese claims. As readers, instead of depending on publications such as the Global Times, we should look at news sources that are read within China. For instance, news about India in The People’s Daily is a far better indicator of how the government wants the news to reach its citizens. Even after the Galwan skirmish, the news did not make it beyond the back pages — indicating that China wants to keep this incident, as well as the issue at LAC, away from public scrutiny.And finally, what are India’s options? What can the government do? Are surgical strikes like in Pakistan a possibility? Or, will there be war? These are critical questions doing the rounds, and correctly so. However, as we deliberate on this, we must be aware of two points. First, China is not Pakistan, and to believe that India’s approach to China can be similar will be a folly. Second, and more important, there are very real costs for war, whether with Pakistan or China. There are other punitive measures, from external balancing by aligning with other countries, to re-looking at the economic relationship with China, to building up domestic capacity. The government’s response will be predicated on the long game, and as we wait for these patterns to emerge, a good place to start would be to look for indications that the element of competition in the relationship is dominating the element of cooperation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/playing-the-long-game-with-china/story-18fruUXxACqdj6Efsn5AsN.html
22-06-2020||Gurugram||Four men loot ₹3 lakh from store employees on Golf Course Road||At least four men allegedly robbed ₹3 lakh from two employees of a departmental store on last Saturday after threatening to stab them on Golf Course Road in DLF Phase-1, said the police on Monday. The police said one of the employees was injured in the incident and rushed to a hospital for treatment.According to the police, the incident took place on Saturday at 10.30am when the staffers of a departmental store in DLF Phase-1 were on their way to a bank in Sector 44 to deposit cash. The police said their car had reached Arjun Marg and was about to take a turn when another white car blocked their path. One of the staffers, Sanjay Singh, said that the white car had been following them and trying to push them to the side of the road for several minutes. “I had signalled to the car driver to maintain distance. But suddenly, he parked the car in front of us at the turning. At least four men, two of whom were masked, alighted from the car. One of the suspects, who had a blade in his hand, snatched the car keys. He attacked my colleague, Swaminath, with the blade and snatched the bag containing the cash. Swaminath suffered a cut on his arm and neck. The other suspects threatened to stab us with a knife. They fled after stealing the bag,” Singh said, adding that the bag contained ₹3 lakh cash. Swaminath was discharged from the hospital on Sunday evening, said the police. The police on Monday recovered the car used by the suspects from Sohna. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said, “An initial probe suggests that the suspects had done a recce and were aware that the employees of the departmental store routinely deposited cash in the bank. We are probing if an ‘insider’ was involved in the planning. The suspects’ car was found abandoned from Sohna.”The police said they have retrieved footage from CCTVs on Golf Course Road and efforts are on to trace the suspects. A case was registered against the suspects under sections 379 B (punishment for snatching) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code at DLF Phase-1 police station on Sunday, said the police. In another incident, several armed men allegedly stole at least 125 cases of liquor from a liquor store in village Khutpuri in Sadar Sohna on Saturday night. The police said the suspects allegedly held a liquor store employee hostage at the gunpoint before loading the liquor cases onto their car. A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said that the suspects took several rounds in their car and transported the liquor to an unidentified location. “The suspects are yet to be identified. An FIR has been registered,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/four-men-loot-3-lakh-from-store-employees-on-golf-course-road/story-HvWcQxzaydTSJ1TOVyqAgM.html

22-06-2020||Chandigarh||Illicit liquor trade in Punjab: Dullo seeks CBI probe into nexus, political patronage||A day after Congress MP Partap Singh Bajwa questioned the state government’s move to adopt the two-year fixed tenure rules for IAS officers, his Rajya Sabha counterpart Shamsher Singh Dullo on Monday sought a probe by CBI or a sitting high court judge into rampant liquor smuggling, bootlegging and illegal distillation of liquor in Punjab.In a strongly worded letter to chief minister Amarinder Singh, Dullo said, “A fair probe is the need of the hour so that the real kingpins causing harm to our cash-strapped exchequer face stringent action.”Dullo, who also raised the liquor smuggling and illegal distribution issue in March, said it may not be feasible for the special investigation team (SIT) set up by the state government to investigate inter-state illegal activities against the political and influential persons at all levels. “No kingpin has been arrested so far except some low-level functionaries. You are also aware that a large number of politicians, including some MLAs of different parties and police officials directly or indirectly are alleged to have been involved in this trade,” the former Punjab Congress president wrote to the CM.Amarinder had on June 5 set up the three-member SIT under water resources minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria to investigate the racket.Dullo said the liquor mafia was growing in the state with active connivance of district police officials and administration, and patronage of local political leaders. He said the illegal distilleries, production and sale of liquor had increased manifold during the recent years, and particularly during the curfew period, in violation of rules and regulations, citing the unlicensed distilleries unearthed at Ghanour, Khanna, Rajpura and Phagwara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/illicit-liquor-trade-in-punjab-dullo-seeks-cbi-probe-into-nexus-political-patronage/story-vzMzYlcZG5vZAjikwaKq7J.html
22-06-2020||City||In a first for Punjab, Ludhiana MC to launch compulsory registration of pets||Pending for around nine years, the Ludhiana municipal corporation(MC) is finally commencing online registration of pets in the city and residents will now have to shell out Rs 400 per annum as registration charges for a pet. The owner will also have to bear the expenses if the pet bites anyone.The Ludhiana MC is the first to commence pet registration in the state. Only pet dogs and cats will be registered in the first phase and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal is expected to start the process on Tuesday.As per the terms and conditions laid down by the MC, it is mandatory for every dog/cat owner to get the pets registered with the MC by December. Otherwise, the owner will have to pay Rs 4,000 as penalty on being caught without registration. According to officials, a pro forma has been finalised and uploaded on the MC’s official website (mcludhiana.gov.in).Pet owners will have to visit the MC’s website and fill in the pro forma giving details and uploading photographs of the pet and the owner.Following this, a licence will be issued online and the owner will have to take a copy of that to the Zone A office of the MC, for getting a token for their pet. MC senior veterinary officer Dr Harbans Dhalla said, “It will be mandatory for the owner to tie the token around the neck of the pet and, if any pet is caught without token, the pet would be taken into custody and the owner would have to pay a fine of Rs 100 per day till the time he/she gets it registered. ““The licence will be renewed every year in April. The owner will bear the expenses on medication, if the pet bites anyone. Pets will not be allowed to defecate on public places and the owner would be responsible for cleaning the area if the pet defecates,” he added.The MC would cover animal breeders, cattle and other animals in the next phase, said Dr Dhalla, adding that the MC finds it difficult to locate the pet owner in absence of registration.He said an abandoned pitbull dog has been in custody of the MC since April 3 and the MC is struggling to find the owner. The MC General House had approved a resolution regarding the registration, proper control of stray animals and compensation to the victims of dog bites in September last year and the local bodies department approved the same in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-a-first-for-punjab-ludhiana-mc-to-launch-compulsory-registration-of-pets/story-ECDJKiHXkmW3SfJlOs4H9H.html
22-06-2020||City||Ghaziabad starts mega drive for early detection of ILI and SARI cases in non-containment areas||Ghaziabad: In a bid to enhance surveillance activities in non-containment areas and also to detect influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) cases early, the district administration has roped in more than 3,000 block level employees who will carry out house-to-house survey on the basis of the voters’ list. Also, 237 district administration officials have been deployed to supervise the survey, officials said on Monday.The officials said that it is for the first time that the activity of such a large scale has been taken up in the district in order to contain the rising Covid-19 cases. The strategy has been formulated in order to pre-empt the suspicious cases and bring them to health care facilities for early treatment, they said.“Taking help of voters’ list, the teams will conduct survey of residents having health complications or having ILI and SARI symptoms in their respective areas. They have been given prescribed form to note down details of people who are having symptoms. The teams will spread awareness and also have been tasked to find out suspicious cases and inform senior officials who will bring such cases to health care facilities,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad.The decision has been taken up in the wake of recent visit of two state government-appointed nodal officers who had also vouched for increased surveillance activities and early detection of ILI and SARI cases.Ghaziabad has been battling with rising number of Covid-19 cases. Of total 46 Covid-related deaths till June 21, about 42 fatalities have taken place since June 1 in the district.The officials of the district health department said that due to delay in detection of ILI and SARI cases, many Covid-19 cases met with fatalities. The total number of Covid-19 cases stood at 918 till June 21.“Such exercise will also be initiated soon for containment areas with bigger number of teams, which we will draw out from the immunization programme. A work plan for this will be chalked out soon,” Pandey added.Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health), has also stressed on new improved surveillance activities and said that four teams are proposed to be deployed in category 1 containment zones and 16 teams for category 2 containment zones. “The detailed protocol for the work plan is being chalked out. This will help us detect suspicious cases and prevent any complications in patients,” Prasad said.In Ghaziabad, there are 244 category 1 containment zones and another set of 35 category 2 zones, according to the latest list of June 18 issued by the district authorities. With the proposed work plan for enhanced surveillance in the containment zones, 976 teams would be required for category 1 zones and 560 for category 2, the officials said.At present, the health department is having 260 teams engaged in surveillance activities in containment zones. “We will be drawing out more teams for the purpose and total strength of our teams is likely to go up to 400,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.The areas where containment zones have increased are in Indirapuram, Vasundhara, Khoda and Vaishali, among others.Till May 30, the district had 65 category 1 containment zones and only seven category 2 zones.Meanwhile, state officials said that the chief minister has directed for formation of one lakh teams for finding out suspicious cases with the help of surveillance.“The CM has said that every household should be covered geographically. Covid help desks should come up at every government office -- at block level, tehsil level, police stations, district hospitals -- and at primary health centres and community health centres. We are also aiming for 25,000 tests per day. The new antigen testing will also be implemented soon,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).The state officials said that it is being taken up initially in five cities of Lucknow, Prayagraj, Gorakhpur, Varanasi and Kanpur City, and will be implemented in NCR areas of western Uttar Pradesh in the next phase.The antigen tests are presently prevalent in the national capital. The tests are quicker than the laboratory-based RT-PCR tests and also cheaper. The test also differs in technology as it looks for specific protein associated with Sars-Cov-2 virus, the pathogen that causes Covid-19. The lab tests, on the other hand, look for the exact nucleic signatures of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-starts-mega-drive-for-early-detection-of-ili-and-sari-cases-in-non-containment-areas/story-CvC1ymD62knCxntkTaMofO.html
22-06-2020||Chandigarh||GNDU to offer PhD course on online studies soon||Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU), Amritsar, on Monday decided to start a doctorate course on online studies soon with the demand of web-based learning at an all-time high in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.The decision was taken in a meeting of the syndicate, said vice-chancellor (V-C) Jaspal Singh Sandhu.“Amid this scenario, the University Grants Commission (UGC) is also promoting online education. As per the criteria, category I and II university or those ranking in top 100 can offer courses on online education. The university’s directorate of online studies will also start functioning soon,” said the V-C who presided over the meeting.Sandhu informed the syndicate that the centre for interfaith studies was approved as a major initiative of the central government to celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak. “A detailed project report (DPR) was submitted to the ministry of human resources and development (MHRD) with a financial proposal of ₹482.12 crore which was revised to ₹439.00 crore. The first annual installment of ₹49.11 crore has been sanctioned by the Union ministry”,” he said.The university, Sandhu said, is getting repeated requests from the Punjabi community and the alumni to start some online courses, especially in Punjabi language and culture. He said the GNDU is going to be the “first paperless working university” shortly.“Examinations of the students studying in the final year of their courses will be held as per the decision taken by UGC,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gndu-to-offer-phd-course-on-online-studies-soon/story-hk2IXhjUsIfypCRVI2h1fJ.html
22-06-2020||City||Monsoon may arrive in Noida, Ghaziabad in next 48 hours||Noida: The monsoon is likely to cover parts of western Uttar Pradesh, including Noida and Ghaziabad, in the next 24 to 48 hours, said the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Monday.According to IMD officials, there are highly favourable conditions of a further advancing of the monsoon with parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh already covered. The region of Noida and Ghaziabad will also see pre-monsoon rain over the next two days and the temperatures are likely to drop by up to three degrees Celsius.“Weather conditions are favourable for the further advancing of monsoon over some more parts of Uttar Pradesh. The monsoon is likely to reach the Noida-Ghaziabad area within next 24 to 48 hours and subsequently across other regions of Delhi-NCR,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.Announcing the early arrival of monsoon, the IMD officials pointed out that this is first time in the past four years that due to the favourable weather conditions, the monsoon is likely to arrive earlier than usual.“For the past four years, the arrival of monsoon in this region had been on or after June 29, and this year we had expected it around June 27. However, this time it is arriving three to four days before the expected date,” Srivastava said.The IMD expects the monsoon to be at the higher end of the normal range (which is 96% to 106%) this year, unlike deficient last year for NCR region. “There is no separate assessment for Noida and Ghaziabad. So, if we draw conclusion based on the records of Delhi, there was a deficit rainfall last year by 40%. Under the normal range, the average rainfall is 60 cm. However, this region last year saw 38-40 cm of rainfall. This year, however, we expect a rainfall of 102-103%, also because of the early arrival,” said Srivastava.According to the IMD, the maximum temperature is also likely to fall by two to three degrees Celsius during the next four days over entire northwest India. The region may also see heavy rains on Thursday.The maximum temperature in Noida on Monday was 36.7 degrees Celsius, two notches below the season’s average, against 39 degrees a day earlier. Tuesday may see a maximum temperature of 35 degrees Celsius, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/monsoon-may-arrive-in-noida-ghaziabad-in-next-48-hours/story-0VrFTM8eRnRqLPLaD0njHJ.html
22-06-2020||Chandigarh||PUDA to acquire 1,764 acre land of closed Bathinda thermal plant||The Punjab cabinet on Monday gave the go-ahead for redevelopment of 1,764 acre land of the closed Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Power Plant in Bathinda. The land belonging to the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) will now be acquired by the Punjab Urban Development Authority (PUDA).The cabinet in a meeting chaired by chief minister Amarinder Singh also mandated PUDA to raise loan up to ₹100 crore for development and sale of the site.The plant was shut down in 2018 as per the recommendations of a sub-committee set up a year earlier in view of the Central Electricity Agency (CEA) guidelines to cease functioning of non-viable thermal power projects having exceeded the 25-year life span.Last month, a cabinet sub-committee was set up to work out the modalities of redevelopment.The PSPCL board had passed a resolution to hand over the land (barring the areas under a residential colony spread over 280 acres) to PUDA for appropriate development and sale. Under the plan, 80% profit from the sale of the developed land, over and above its notional value, will go to the owner (PSPCL) and 20% will be shared by PUDA as developer. PUDA will rope in the services of professional agency to advise it on the best possible utilisation of different parcels of the land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/puda-to-acquire-1-764-acre-land-of-closed-bathinda-thermal-plant/story-lYFN2AqilrQZCtE9uLnojP.html
22-06-2020||Chandigarh||Protest at Rohtak varsity: ‘Govt should roll back its decision, promote all students’||Three days after Rohtak-based Maharshi Dayanand University announced the exam dates for final year students enrolled in 37 graduate, postgraduate and diploma courses, students’ bodies on Monday flayed the varsity’s decision, claiming it to be against the best interests of students. As per the Haryana government’s notification issued on June 12, which was followed by the Rohtak varsity, the local students studying in the final year will have to appear for exams. For the students from outside Haryana, the average of all previous exams may be taken or they can opt either for taking the exam or improvement of grades later on by physical examination, if they haven’t taken any exam earlier. The university will be conducting final year exams between July 6 and July 26. Protesting against university vice-chancellor Rajbir Singh, the Indian National Students’ Organisation’s (INSO’s) vice-president, Deepak Malik, said the authorities made their decision while ignoring the health concerns of thousands of students. “The V-C took the decision to conduct final year exams for local students without examining the ground report. Many of the university students belong to Sonepat, Jhajjar, Bhiwani and Rohtak, the districts which are witnessing a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases. Many of students’ localities have been declared as containment zones. How they will come to appear in the exams? The varsity and government should roll back their decision and promote all students,” he added.Calling the move unfair, Raman Dhaka, general secretary of INLD Students’ Organization (ISO), asked, “How can the government and varsities frame different rules for students studying on the same campus on the basis of their region? What is the guarantee that Covid-19 cases will not increase in July and all local students will be able to appear in the exams?”Meanwhile, BS Sandhu, university controller of examination, said they had released the datesheet on the directions of the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/protest-at-rohtak-varsity-govt-should-roll-back-its-decision-promote-all-students/story-2NqKdFwqBlU5cax9yTlF0J.html
22-06-2020||City||Delhi High Court stays FIR against Ganga Ram hospital||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Monday stayed the FIR registered against Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on a complaint by the Delhi government for allegedly not following protocols for testing patients with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The court, in its interim order, said that the FIR does not suggest any “obstruction, annoyance or injury” or “any impediment to human health”.“I am, therefore, convinced that, tested on the principles of existence of a prima facie case, balance of convenience, irreparable loss, and public interest, the process of investigation, consequent to the registration of the impugned FIR against the applicant, deserves to be stayed, pending final disposal of the present writ petition,” Justice C Hari Shankar said in the interim order.The hospital authorities had moved the high court on June 13, seeking quashing of the FIR and also seeking a stay on the case. The order comes while deciding the stay application while the main plea would be heard on August 11.Justice Harishankar said that the only allegation in the FIR is violation of the directions issued by the Delhi government on April 30 and May 6 which required the collection of samples, for Covid-19 testing, to be done only through RT-PCR.The judge said that for the violation of government orders, criminal process cannot be initiated, against an institution, merely on the ground that such violation has taken place.“There is no other allegation in the FIR. There is no reference, in the FIR, to this infraction, on the part of the petitioner, in collecting samples through the RT-PCR app, having caused or obstruction, annoyance or injury, or risk of obstruction, annoyance, or injury, to any person lawfully employed, or having caused, or attempted to cause, danger to human life, health or safety, or riot or affray,” the court said.The court said that the FIR does not so allege, either expressly or by necessary implication; consequently, it has to be held that the allegations in the FIR do not disclose the commission of a cognizable offence.The FIR was filed on June 5 on the basis of a complaint by the deputy secretary of Delhi’s department of health and family welfare, Amit Kumar Pamasi. The FIR was registered under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) that mandates a punishment of one month’s simple imprisonment and/or ₹200 fine or six months imprisonment and/ or ₹1,000 fine if the offence puts human life at risk. The section of the IPC can be invoked under the Epidemic Diseases Act that has been in force in Delhi since mid-March as the city is battling the Covid-19 pandemic.The plea by the hospital authorities had contended that the FIR was “vague” and does not show that any offence was committed under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). It had also said that the FIR was silent “how disobedience, as alleged by the Delhi government, is causing obstruction, annoyance or injury to any person.”Earlier on June 17, the court had put the proceedings under the FIR in abeyance till June 22 while reserving its order on the stay application.Advocate Rahul Mehra, standing counsel (criminal) for the Delhi government, had told the court that if prima facie an offence is visible to have been committed, law permits them to register an FIR and investigate the same. He said that the hospital had violated the norms and hence an offence had been committed.After hearing lengthy arguments, the court had reserved its order and said that it would pronounce the judgment on June 22.On June 3, the hospital had been asked to stop Covid testing, citing violations of ICMR guidelines. However, on June 17, the Delhi government had granted the hospital permission to resume testing.Ajoy Sehgal, public relations officer, Ganga Ram hospital. said that the matter is sub-judice and he would refrain from making any comments. The Delhi government did not respond to queries from HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-high-court-stays-fir-against-ganga-ram-hospital/story-Y18W9gYzXF9wrdRaHNYVyH.html

22-06-2020||City||As cases rise, Ghaziabad health department shifts focus to opening bigger L1 hospitals||As the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases continue to rise at a rapid pace in Ghaziabad, the district health department is now shifting its focus to opening bigger L1 category Covid hospitals.Till June 22, the district had 958 Covid-19, out of which 653 cases were reported since June 1 alone. District health officials expect the tally to cross 1,200 by June-end at this pace. Officials said as around 75-80%of Covid-19 patients are asymptomatic and given the workforce shortage, the health department needs bigger L1 facilities where more patients with no symptoms can be looked after by the same number of doctors and health care workers that are deployed at smaller L1 Covid hospitals.The district has already identified 13 educational institutes which will be converted into L1 facilities in phases as and when the need arises to accommodate new patients.To treat asymptomatic Covid-19 patients, the district currently relies heavily on the 76-bedded L1 category ESIC Hospital at Sahibabad and another 60-bedded L1 facility (government acquired St Joesph’s Hospital) in Nandgram . Besides this, the district has a 100-bedded L2 Covid facility in Sanjay Nagar (District Combined Hospital) and another 400-bedded L3 category facility near the Old Bus Stand (government acquired Santosh Medical College). Under the Uttar Pradesh government’s three-tier health care structure, the L1 hospitals are meant for treating asymptomatic patients, while L2 hospitals cater to patients with moderate complications and the L3 hospitals treat critical cases.“We are now focussing on starting bigger L1 hospitals which have a capacity of around 200-400 beds. This is because 75-80% of the Covid-19 cases are asymptomatic and need to be taken to L1 Covid hospitals as per the present norms. Unlike Delhi, we don’t have any guidelines which allow home isolation for asymptomatic patients. As a result, with the rising numbers of cases, we are forced to shift our asymptomatic patients from L1 facilities to L2 and L3 hospitals. So, now our strategy is to come up with bigger L1 hospitals and not open smaller ones,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO). The district has 376 active cases currently.Each team of 25 doctors, nurses, and other health care workers deployed at smaller L1 hospitals currently, has the capacity to cater to patients at a 200-bedded L1 hospitals, health officials said.“With the pace at which new cases are being reported, we are likely to open a 200-bedded L1 Covid facility at Divya Jyoti Ayurvedic Medical College & Hospital in Niwari in the next two or three days. This hospital will be able to accommodate new cases for about 15-20 days. As cases will continue to rise, we will also open another L1 facility in Modinagar at the SRM University campus which has 400 beds out of which 100 beds are already ready for Covid patients. After this we will open a 250-bedded l1 facility in a private college in Dasna),” the CMO said.The officials said with the available workforce, they can cater to nearly 1,426 beds in different category hospitals, of which doctors can nearly manage over 926 beds in L1 facilities. The officials said that they have submitted these figures to the UP government-appointed nodal officers who had recently visited Ghaziabad during a week long-tour to assess the pandemic situation and the infrastructure available to deal with rising cases.“Once we have 1,426 beds occupied with Covid patients, our workforce will be exhausted and to cater to more infected persons we will need to shut down primary and community health centres, government health care facilities to make up for the lack of doctors, nurses. This is not a practical option, but even if it comes to that, we will be able to cater to a maximum of 2,000 occupied beds”, the CMO said. Officials said if all the 13 educational institutes are converted into L1 facilities, they will have a total capacity of 4,000 beds, and the district health departments will need help from other UP districts with a lower caseload to look after at the patients when these facilities reach full capacity.“We will continue using the L1 facility at Sahibabad as the ESIC hospital (a central government-run entity) has deployed their own staff. We are, however, likely to shut the L1 facility at Nandgram in the next 10-15 days or so. The hospital management had approached us recently to allow them to resume normal operations there, Dr Gupta said. Earlier in May, a 30-bedded L1 facility in a community health centre in Muradnagar was shut down, and its health team will be now be deployed at the upcoming facility in Niwari.In another development, the health department has received the estimates of the charges that would be applicable in a private hospital in Vaishali which was among five private facilities in Ghaziabad authorised to give Covid treatment.The hospital will charge ₹7,500 for a private room, ₹ 7,000 for a semi-private room, ₹ 6,200 for general ward, ₹10,000 for ICU and ₹ 6000 for isolation. “The rates are on per day basis for a hospital in Vaishali and it is according to their regular charges and they haven’t hiked their prices. The patient will pay for consumables. We have three more hospitals that will soon come up with separate Covid-19 wards in Kaushambi (50 beds), Nehru Nagar (30 beds) and Vasundhara (30 beds). The list of charges from them will be received shortly,” the CMO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-cases-rise-ghaziabad-health-department-shifts-focus-to-opening-bigger-l1-hospitals/story-F6UQk1mZDnseoo2NhCQfSO.html
22-06-2020||Chandigarh||Short of funds, Punjabi University banks on fees to pay staff salaries||With no funds available to meet its committed expenses, Punjabi University, Patiala, is banking on fee collection from students to pay the salaries to its faculty members and other employees.The university has failed to release the salaries and pensions to its nearly 5,800 serving and retired staffers for the month of May.Even the Punjab government failed to provide any financial relief after the varsity management took up the issue related to severe financial crisis being faced by the institution.“In such a scenario, the university has no option than to depend upon fee collection from students already admitted in undergraduate and postgraduate courses. The last date of submitting fee is June 23,” said a senior official.The monthly salary budget of the university is pegged at ₹33 crore. As per the budgetary proposals for this fiscal, the varsity expects to generate ₹250 crore from its own resources out of the total annual revenue of ₹380 crore, including government aid.These resources mainly include examination fee, tuition fee, funds and security amounts of students, fee from distance education courses, registration and revaluation charges, etc.Varsity registrar Prof Manjit Singh Nijjar said they are making every possible effort to generate or get funds to pay salaries and pensions to the employees.“The funds generated from fee collection are a major source of income for the university. With Tuesday being the last day of fee submission, we expect good collections and the expenses will be met accordingly. The salaries will be paid at the earliest,” he added.The university has also directed its regional centres and constituent colleges to deposit parent-teachers association (PTA) funds and security to the tune of ₹1.35 crore submitted by students while getting admission in these institutions.Punjabi University Teachers’ Union (PUTA) secretary Gurnam Singh Virk said a letter on the institution’s financial condition and their demand for the release of special grant has been sent to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh.“The vice-chancellor has not been able to mobilise funds for the timely release of salaries and deposit of deductions,” Virk said.PUTA president Prof Jaswinder Singh Brar said the chances of release of salary and deposit of deductions are quite dim.“Moreover, the provident fund (PF) deductions for the last three months and the National Pension Scheme (NPS) contribution for the last two months have not been deposited,” Brar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/short-of-funds-punjabi-university-banks-on-fees-to-pay-staff-salaries/story-5iZBtj3xb5w7H7cWYKLo0L.html

Papers were cancelled, extra marks were given in interviews and the Supreme Court later declared the appointments fraudulent. Wasn’t it a scam? Hooda should himself come forward for a probe in this scam and FIR should be registered against him,” he added. Responding to a question about the missing liquor case, the deputy CM said it was not a scam, but a theft. An SIT has been formed to investigate the allegations, he added. On the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the state, Dushyant said, “We cannot predict the number of cases emerging in the next three months, but the government is ready to deal with any situation in the future.”Reacting to the campaigns being launched on social media to boycott Chinese goods, he said there was a need to make the country self-reliant as the people cannot survive without the items being imported from China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/physical-training-instructors-recruitment-hooda-should-face-probe-says-dushyant/story-yHWBrQ0GnX2Xf1y6HXY08M.html
22-06-2020||Chandigarh||Pay for power bill of up to ₹20,000 by cheque in Panchkula||Power bills of up to Rs 20,000 will again be payable through cheque in Panchkula, nearly six months after the service was discontinued on December 1, 2019.The move followed directions by the Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC) while disposing of representations against discontinuing of cheque payments by the Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (UHBVN). “In the era of Covid-19 more and more reliance has to be placed on digital platforms, the concerns of certain sections of society, particularly senior citizens, also need to be addressed. Therefore, a judicious balance has to be struck,” ruled HERC while directing that any amount exceeding ₹5000 shall not be accepted by cash. However, payments of up to ₹20,000 can be made through cheque.SK Nayar, president, Indian Citizen Forum, Panchkula, had approached HERC, saying UHBVN had abruptly and unilaterally stopped accepting cheques for electricity bills for an amount below ₹10,000. Disposing of the representation HERC said, “Transaction charges for payment through payment gateway on the website of the Discoms by way of credit card, debit card, net banking and also the transaction charges for payment through point of sale machines at the Discoms counters and e-wallets etc shall be borne by the Discoms subject to a maximum of ₹150.”UHBVN, while justifying its decision to not accept cheques had cited misuse of the payment facility by industrial consumers who blamed banks for delay in cheque clearance. Dependency on manual work and non-availability of clearing house in rural areas resulted in late credit of revenue in the Nigam’s account, it had said.“The decision has come a major relief to many senior citizens in Panchkukla,” Nayar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pay-for-power-bill-of-up-to-20-000-by-cheque-in-panchkula/story-rXbP5oPhOayJEMhBRQrlnK.html
22-06-2020||Mumbai||Aaditya Thackeray opposes mining near Tadabo Andhari Tiger Reserve||State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray has opposed the Centre’s proposal to conduct an auction for mining at a site near Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) in Maharashtra.Thackeray has written to union environment minister Prakash Javadekar, urging him to withdraw the proposal, as it will harm the tiger reserve.Thackeray on Monday said this auction was cancelled twice before in 1999 and 2001. “When we are aware that such a move will spell disaster in the Tadoba and Andhari Tiger Reserve, what is the point in spending our time and resources on such a project?” he said.Bander coal block, located close to TATR in Chandrapur district, is one of the 41 mining sites in the country, for which the Centre has invited bids for an auction.He said that 10 years ago, the then union environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, had ordered a survey and the results concluded that the site was not suitable for mining. Thackeray has requested Javadekar for survey of the proposed site again.Both Aaditya and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray are well-known wildlife enthusiasts. The duo had also opposed cutting of trees in Mumbai’s Aarey Colony for Metro-3 project.Environmentalists have supported Thackeray’s stance. “We are only encroaching on the space of the wildlife and increasing the man-animal conflict,” said Debi Goenka, an environmentalist. However, he said that being in the government, Thackeray has the power to derail the project.“The state government needs to emphasise that they will not give any approvals required for the project and this itself will dissuade the bidders from entering the project,” he added. Another environmentalist Stalin Dayanand said mining is a highly polluting industry which destroys the wildlife. “This will be a disruptive move, as studies point out that mining causes irreparable damage to forests. The wildlife is also is threatened considerably,” said Dayanand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aaditya-thackeray-opposes-mining-near-tadabo-andhari-tiger-reserve/story-qxRtulZ3BOmMYrnsXWu4YP.html
22-06-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad: NIA wants to question Gautam Navlakha again||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has moved an application to once again obtain the custody of civil rights activist Gautam Navlakha who was arrested in the Elgar Parishad case after he surrendered at the agency’s Delhi office on April 14.The application was moved before the special NIA court through special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty claiming that the chief investigating officer in the case had not questioned him when he was in NIA’s custody and that he needs to question him over the statement given by witnesses.“We have made an application before the special court to question Navlakha for his alleged role in the Elgar Parishad case. Navlakha was earlier interrogated in Delhi, but the investigating officer (IO) was not there due to lockdown. He was brought to Mumbai last month, and now a fresh application has been made for his custody so that he can be questioned in Mumbai,” said an NIA officer, requesting anonymity.Navlakha, along with other activists, has been accused of having links with the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) and for his alleged involvement in the Elgar Parishad gathering that happened on December 31, 2017, which allegedly triggered caste-based violence at Bhima Koregaon in Pune, the next day.Navlakha has been booked under various sections of the draconian Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), which allows an investigating agency to have custody of the accused of a period of 30 days, and gives the agency 180 days to file a charge sheet with prior permission from the court, and under sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Navlakha was first arrested by the Pune police on August 28, 2018, but the Delhi High court had quashed his arrest on October 1, 2018. The prosecution had alleged that till August-2018 he was a member of CPI (Maoist).While arresting Navlakha, Pune police had cited several letters, recovered from the computer of one of the accused exchanged between the accused booked in the case. It was alleged that Navlakha and some of the other activists who are also arrested in the case, had direct access and communication with central committee members and senior leaders of CPI (Maoist). Pune police had also alleged that Navlakha was part of the conspiracy and the police were probing if there was a larger conspiracy of seizing the political power, armed revolution by mobilizing masses.Since his release in October 2018, Navlakha had approached courts for anticipatory bail fearing that he would be arrested again by the police. In the meanwhile, the probe of the case was transferred from Maharashtra police to NIA in January this year, while the order on the anticipatory bail plea was still pending before the Bombay High court. The plea was rejected, and later Apex Court too refused to grant him any protection and had directed him to surrender before the agency.Following the order of the Apex court, Navlakha had surrendered on April 14 at Delhi. He was later remanded to NIA custody. The NIA questioned him over the allegations of his links with the banned organizations and his involvement into the incident of Elgar Parishad. Navlakha was under NIA custody for fourteen days after his arrest before he was remanded to judicial custody. He was lodged in Tihar jail since he was remanded to judicial custody.Even as an interim bail plea citing the spread of COVID-19 was pending in the Delhi High Court, NIA on May 26 transferred Navlakha from Tihar jail, with the permission of a court, and brought him to Mumbai by train. Navlakha since then has been lodged at Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai.Meanwhile, Navlakha has sought bail as the agency has failed to file a charge sheet within 90 days. “We have moved a bail plea for Navlakha as the investigating agency has failed to file charge sheet against him within a stipulated time of 90 of his total custody,” said Navlakha’s lawyer, Yug Mohit Chaudhry.Both the applications are scheduled for hearing on June 26 before the special NIA court. Interestingly, the developments come at a time when Navlakha, who is in judicial custody till July 3, spoke to his partner Sehba Hussain alleged that the conditions where prisoners are kept under quarantine in the jail were overcrowded and unhygienic“We are very worried about the conditions under which Navlakha is kept. We are requesting the government to put him under the proper facility. If there was no place and proper arrangement in prisons and quarantine centres of Mumbai, why was he shifted to Mumbai from Delhi? We will be urging courts to consider the conditions,” Husain said.Interestingly, Navlakha before he surrendered had in an open letter written, ‘I can now begin to face the actual legal process, which accompanies cases where provisions of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act are invoked. Such Acts turn the normal jurisprudence upside down. No longer is it the axiom that ‘a person is innocent unless proven guilty’. In fact, under such Acts, ‘an accused is guilty unless proven innocent’. ‘Draconian provisions of UAPA are not accompanied by stricter procedures regarding evidence, especially electronic, considering the stringent punishment provided for under the Act; the procedures, which otherwise provide tighter rules regarding evidence, are instead made elastic. Under this double whammy, jail becomes the norm, and bail an exception. In this Kafkaesque domain, the process itself becomes punishment,’ he had further gone on to write.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-nia-wants-to-question-gautam-navlakha-again/story-wa01w6qyxgJ4nBy6vGzOqO.html
22-06-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC starts clearing drains ahead of monsoons, locals not satisfied||The municipal corporation has started work on a war footing to clear up drains and sewer lines before the monsoon hits.With stormwater drains not laid out and old sewer lines under pressure due to low capacity, most areas in the city, including premium zones such as Model Town Extension and Sarabha Nagar and the old quarters and outskirts, are prone to waterlogging.The MC is for the first time getting the city’s main drain, Buddha nullah, desilted by a private firm. The process however was delayed and could only begin in the last week of May.Residents living in areas close by, however, have said that in the last few years work was not carried out satisfactorily. During the rain the nullah overflows at a few points including New Kundanpuri area, Upkar Nagar, Shivpuri and surrounding areas.“The desilting work is not managed well and silt is not removed from the centre and whatever is dredged out is dumped on the banks. All of it gets into the drain after rain,” says Narinder Malhi, former BJP councillor.The authorities are also working to increase the capacity of the Talab Bazar drain by removing the pipes in it.However, the locals are not too pleased with the MC’s drain cleaning drive.“New sewer lines were laid out in our area in November last year, but the drains are already choked. The MC staff had cleaned the lines a few days back but the problem persists,” says Sahil Khurana, resident of Bishan Enclave in the Civil City area. MC commissioner, Pardeep Sabharwal, however, said, “Buddha nullah and road gullies are being cleaned up. The MC is also working to clear a drain in the old city areas which has remained choked for years. I had also inspected the ongoing work few days back and the staff at sewer treatment plants has been told to operate the plants efficiently to avoid rain water accumulation. A dedicated control room will soon be established in the coming days to deal with waterlogging woes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-mc-starts-clearing-drains-ahead-of-monsoons-locals-not-satisfied/story-vj0PC1gocsFwTa4XrY80GL.html

Talk directly to BMC’s engineers||With the onset of monsoon, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Monday issued WhatsApp mobile numbers of civic engineers, for citizens to complain about the potholes problem during the monsoon.In a public notice issued on Monday, the BMC said, “The BMC has provided the facility on MCGM 24x7 app to enable citizens of Mumbai to register complaints about potholes on the roads. This app can be downloaded from Play Store. Apart from this, citizens can also register complaints on toll-free number 1800221293 and on WhatsApp directly.”A BMC official said, “We have issued WhatsApp numbers for all the 24 wards for citizens to complain, and we plan to attend all the complaints between 24 to 48 hours. This year, road repair work in several areas was impacted due to the outbreak of novel coronavirus. We have stopped work in the area around containment zones.”Last year, the BMC had announced a pothole challenge, announcing cash prize for citizens over reporting of potholes. The challenge invited people to click pictures of potholes or take selfies with them and upload the images via Fixit app. The images were automatically geo-tagged in the app.According to terms and conditions set by the BMC, a person can report two potholes and he or she will get an award up to ₹500. However, the catch is that the person got the money only if the BMC failed to repair the pothole within 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/potholes-in-your-area-talk-directly-to-bmc-s-engineers/story-uPZ0v7DmkK0jb8PxzYgvwM.html

The facility will ensure that movement of buses in the city area in checked to a certain extent. The development comes after Bathinda Cantonment authorities approved the new design of the four-storey project. The DC added that the army had reservation, mainly to the entry point of the ISBT and not its basic design. Union food processing industries minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal had laid the foundation stone of the project in 2016, but the army had objected to its proximity to the cantonment area.“The Bathinda Improvement Trust will execute the project. As per a communiqué that the cantonment authorities have shared with us, a draft MoU has been sent to the army headquarters for final approval. We hope that the development project will start soon,” said the DC.Bathinda Improvement Trust (BIT) executive officer Neeru Bala said the reworked design of the project had been accepted by the authorities. Of 18 acre, eight acre will be used for busways, two acre for workshop and a commercial complex will be developed on the rest of the eight acre. An air-conditioned waiting hall for passengers and restaurants will also be built. Parking will be built for 200 cars and similar number of two-wheelers.Strap/BlurbAgreement could be inked within 10 days, says DC; the development comes after Bathinda Cantonment authorities approved the new design of the four-storey project to be built on 18 acre on the outskirts of the city||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bathinda-admn-army-to-sign-mou-for-state-s-1st-ac-bus-stand-next-week/story-qLKNtexsAtSJXK2qWDvTQL.html
22-06-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra goverment puts on hold 3 MoUs with Chinese companies||After the Galwan Valley standoff, the Maharashtra government has decided to put on hold the process to allow three Chinese companies to set up plants in the state. State industries minister Subhash Desai said in a statement on Monday: “We have decided to put the memoranda of understanding (MoUs) signed with three Chinese firms worth ₹5,020 crore on hold. However, this doesn’t mean that they have been cancelled. We will wait for a clear policy from the Central government on this issue.” On June 15, the state government signed 12 MoUs worth ₹16,300 crore with major global companies. Of them, MoUs worth over ₹5,000 crore were signed with three Chinese firms — Hengli (₹250 crore), Great Wall Motors (₹3,770 crore) and PMI Electro Mobility Solutions, a joint venture with Foton (₹1,000 crore). Soon, clashes were reported between Indian and Chinese troops at Galwan Valley in Ladakh, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.Earlier, amid standoff, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) cancelled the bids to manufacture 10 monorail rakes received from two Chinese companies – CRRC Corporation Ltd and BYD Co Ltd. MMRDA on Saturday said the Chinese firms were constantly seeking revision in terms and conditions. “As the two Chinese companies are dictating us to change the tender conditions, MMRDA has decided to look for technology partners in India. As we do not require large quantities, it is possible for Indian firms to manufacture and supply [the coaches] in less time,” MMRDA metropolitan commissioner RA Rajeev said.Six Chinese companies are involved in infrastructure projects in Mumbai with the 337-km Metro project, which has an estimated cost of ₹1 lakh crore. Of these, Shanghai Tunnel Engineering Co Ltd (STEC), China Railway Tunnel Group Co Ltd (CRTG) and Continental Engineering Corporation (CEC) are undertaking civil and tunnel works for Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz). The Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC), which is building the fully underground Metro, has appointed the SJEC Corporation, a Chinese consortium, for system works.CRTG in a joint venture with J Kumar Infraprojects Ltd, is also building parts of Metro-2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro-6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli). Another Chinese company, China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (CHEC), is building part of Metro-4 (Wadala-Kasarvadavali) in a joint venture with Tata Projects.A senior MMRDA official said the involvement of the Chinese companies “stands as it is”. “So far, there is no advisory [against the involvement of Chinese companies],” said the official, on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-goverment-puts-on-hold-3-mous-with-chinese-companies/story-BmppvGhRNH8WGYNCdg0IXN.html
22-06-2020||Chandigarh||Skinners stop lifting carcasses, epidemic fears in dairy complexes||Even as the coronavirus pandemic rages, there are fears of another disease outbreak at the Tajpur and Haibowal dairy complexes as skinners, protesting against the fine imposed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), have gone on strike and refused to lift animal carcasses.At least 70 carcasses, including those of buffalos, cows, oxen and calves, are lying at both dairy complexes and decomposing rapidly due to hot weather conditions.According to dairy owners, the skinners stopped lifting carcasses on Saturday. If the carcasses were not removed from dairies, another epidemic would break out in the city.Concerned over the situation, dairy owners met mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu on Monday over the issue.President of the Tajpur Road Dairy Association DS Oberoi said that dead animals have been lying in the dairies since Friday. The problem will aggravate soon after carcasses will start decomposing. They would meet the deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma and cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu to intervene in the matter.The NGT had issued notices to skinners in March this year, following which they had stopped working in protest. However, following an assurance of mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu, they had again started lifting the carcasses.A skinner, Happy Kainth, said five families are involved in dumping carcasses in Ladhowal near the Sutlej. Following a complaint of a local, the NGT formed a committee. After the committee submitted a report, the NGT imposed a fine of Rs 2.28 crore on each family.The NGT had also ordered them to stop dumping carcasses near the Sutlej as it led to water as well as air pollution.Happy added, “As we have no resources to pay the fine, we stopped lifting carcasses from the city.”“We usually lifted 40 to 50 carcasses daily from dairies and nearby villages and disposed of them at the carcass dumping ground. Now, we have been forced to stop lifting carcasses,” said Suraj.Paramjit Singh Bobby, chairman, Haibowal Dairy Complex, said they are holding a meeting with skinners to resolve the issue to save the situation.Mayor Sandhu said dairy farmers raised the issue with him on Monday.“We would not allow people to cause any kind of pollution, but we cannot let the carcasses decompose in dairies. I have asked the MC to complete the carcass plant at Noorpur Bet, which is already under construction, as soon as possible,” said the mayor.“I have also asked dairy owners and skinners to hold a meeting to resolve the issue. We will try to find a permanent solution of the problem later,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/skinners-stop-lifting-carcasses-epidemic-fears-in-dairy-complexes/story-98pHBQrjpGJCm8yw5aHa7J.html
22-06-2020||Mumbai||Consumers take to social media over inflated power bills in state||Many power consumers in the state took to social media to complain about inflated bills after distribution companies started meter-reading recently. However, power companies have stated that there is no error and consumers are receiving bills as per actual consumption in the last two months.“Meter reading was discontinued in March-end, owing to which consumers were being sent bills as per average consumption of December, January and February. However, consumption was much more in the months of April and May owing to summer and the lockdown,” a senior official from the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) said.An MSEDCL consumer from Kharghar, Saurabh Marathe tweeted, “The bill appears to be inflated as our electricity consumption is not as high as ₹9,270. Our average bill every month is about ₹2,000. I request MSEDCL to look into the matter.” Another user stated that their average bill is ₹600 per month, but they have got a bill for ₹2,200 for May.In Mumbai, Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML) and the Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) Undertaking have also started actual reading except in containment zones and sealed buildings. An AEML spokesperson said that electricity consumption normally increases from April till the onset of monsoon. BEST officials said that they are resuming meter reading as per staff availability.“Both domestic consumers as well as commercial ones are straining under the huge power bills charged by electricity companies. The companies have sent bills for three months at a go, in many cases these charges have not been subtracted from the average bill charged monthly when the power companies were under a lock down. The state government needs to address this issue immediately. They should consider waiving off bills for consumption of 300 units or at least allow consumers to pay in instalments,’’ said former chief minister and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis. Fadnavis has also written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to address this issue.MSEDCL had appealed to consumers to send actual reading during the lockdown. Of its 2.30 crore consumers, only 2.65 lakh sent readings, officials said. Consumers can also visit https://billcal.mahadiscom.in/consumerbill to get information on their bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/consumers-take-to-social-media-over-inflated-power-bills-in-state/story-wOGRUM0I2gJ9v8wAI1FEQN.html

Doctors declared the animal dead at 7 am. “Though the cause of death appears to be septicaemia, the final post-mortem report is awaited,” said Nandkishore Kale, divisional manager of Gorewada Project.Dr Madhuri Hedau, assistant professor, NVC who led the post-mortem examination, said “The tiger was two-and-half to three years old. We found the presence of abscesses (collection of pus buildup within the tissue) on the tiger’s left hind leg that could have spread the infection leading to Septicaemia as per our tentative assessment. We have collected tissue samples and sent them for further examination, and we will have more clarity on the cause of death after the lab results and toxicology report.”The big cat, KT-1 was brought to Gorewada Wildlife Rescue Centre on June 11. The tiger was then quarantined, as per directives by National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). The beast showed poor appetite since arrival and failed to acclimatise to captive life. The team of experts from Wildlife Research and Training Centre, Gorewada, were observing the tiger. The KT-1 was, however, active and showed no signs of any core illness, said Nandkishor Kale, divisional manager, Gorewada Project, Nagpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kt-1-tiger-dies-at-rescue-centre-in-nagpur/story-O5gDkVM8RZD0ik8b62T8gM.html
22-06-2020||Mumbai||Coastal Road Project: Tree felling inevitable, but project will reduce pollution, flooding, says BMC||In response to 176 suggestions and objections by citizens on cutting of trees for the Coastal Road, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has said tree felling is inevitable. The civic body has also defended the Coastal Road Project on grounds that it will reduce flooding, pollution and increase the green cover.BMC, replying to the queries, said, “It is inevitable to cut few trees falling in the alignment of Coastal Road to construct it. Though few trees are affected, compensatory afforestation with the ratio of 1:3 is proposed. Further, green areas will be created along the Coastal Road. The Coastal Road Project will benefit the public at large in various aspects. It will reduce pollution, save time and increase the green cover etc. The transplantation/cutting of trees will be carried out as per the guidelines and approval by the Tree Authority.”The BMC had called for suggestions and objections from citizens for cutting and transplantation of trees between Princess Street Flyover and Worli for construction of around 9km long Coastal Road project in February 2020.The BMC had received around 176 suggestions and objections for the same. On Saturday, the civic body uploaded responses to these suggestions.According to BMC, around 600 trees will be affected during the construction of the ambitious Mumbai Coastal Road, which is proposed to link Marine Drive to the southern end of Bandra-Worli Sea Link. Of these 140 trees are proposed to be cut, while 460 are to be transplanted. Between Princess Street Flyover and Priyadarshani Park, 31 trees are proposed to be cut and 127 transplanted. Between Bhulabhai Desai Road and Tata Garden, 61 are proposed to be cut and 79 transplanted. Lastly, from Haji Ali to Lotus junction at Lala Lajpatrai Road, 38 trees are proposed to be cut and 49 transplanted, while at Worli Seaface, 10 trees are to be cut and 205 transplanted.Zoru Bhathena, citizen environmentalist, who had filed the objection over cutting and transplanting of trees said, “I do not understand why 600 trees are affected for a road that is being built on reclaimed land? The BMC has to come out clear on how so many trees are being affected. We could understand five-10 trees being cut or transplanted, but 600 is a huge number. Also, BMC claims Coastal Road will result in the reduction of flooding conditions, however, it looks like BMC follows their made-up theories on physics, geography, history and environmental studies. This is just a classic example of all that is wrong with BMC.”The coastal road project was originally conceptualised to connect the suburbs and the city and is likely to unclog Mumbai’s roads. Of the total 90 hectares (ha) that will be reclaimed for Phase-1 of the coastal road between Princess Street Flyover and Worli, 20 ha is allotted for the project, while the remaining 70ha is reserved for green cover, in which BMC plans to undertake the plantation.Meanwhile, Pradip Patade, marine conservationist from south Mumbai said, “I doubt that flooding conditions will reduce due to construction of a Coastal Road. This is a general logic because the more you fill in the sea, the more will come out. I have seen pictures of how water has been hitting the construction site, and somehow I doubt whether flooding conditions will reduce due to coastal road.”Responding to the same, Vijay Nighot, chief engineer, BMC’s coastal road project said, “We are yet not at the stage where tree cutting or transplantation can start for now considering we are yet to get the final nod from the BMC’s tree authority. Also, when we say flooding will reduce, it is because we are going to build a sea-wall, and due to this comparatively flooding will reduce. We have not claimed that there will not be any flooding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coastal-road-project-tree-felling-inevitable-but-project-will-reduce-pollution-flooding-says-bmc/story-wsFTNyMui64ju9ktH26ewJ.html

The provision creates barriers to justice for non-Hindi-speaking citizens, constraining advocates ill-versed with Hindi from appearing before courts. It acts as a restriction upon the right of an advocate to practise before any court within the territory of India, the court was told adding that the law provides for training to court-staff and officials, but not for advocates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hindi-as-official-language-of-courts-hc-notice-to-haryana-on-plea-challenging-move/story-OzVXERRLCeqE8rKNmqHu1K.html

In his plea to HC, Dhesi, who retired as chief secretary in June 2019, sought the quashing of March 2011 and October 2019 letters from the administration which said a penal rent 50 times that of the normal fee was imposed on him for overstay in a Sector-7 accommodation upon his transfer to Delhi in June 2010.Dhesi told the court that he was being charged ₹3.23 lakh penal rent out of a total of ₹ 6.59 lakh by the administration for overstay in the accommodation. He had not been able to vacate it as his official accommodation was not ready, he pleaded.HC was told that as the administration had not issued him a no dues certificate because of which his gratuity of ₹20lakh had not been released by the government.HC was told that six months of Dhesi’s retention period from June 2010 had not been calculated. A government servant had reasonable expectation of being dealt with justly and fairly in receiving rights granted to him under government residence Chandigarh administration general pool allotment rules, 1996, Dhesi told the court, adding that government accommodation was a statutory benefit a government servant was entitled to.Citing a similar case of a Haryana cadre official in December 2019, he said the administration waived the penal rent for the man who was allotted house in Sector 16 in his capacity as deputy commissioner.

In Punjab, over 2.5 lakh students belonging to the schedule castes are the direct beneficiaries of the scheme. Under the scheme, the scholarship (mainly as academic fee waiver) is paid to the students whose parents and guardians’ annual income from all sources does not exceed ₹2.5 lakh.PUCA president Anshu Kataria said, “The Covid-19 crisis has added to the misery of unaided colleges and due to excessive delay in the release of PMS funds, we are facing acute shortage of funds. We are unable to bear operating expenses of which staff salary is a major component.” Raising questions on the working of the state government, members of the JAC said, “When some of the funds have already been released by the Centre, there is no valid reason for the state government to not disburse the amount to the institutions.”Manjit Singh, senior vice-president of PUTIA said colleges are waiting to be paid for the last three to four years. He added colleges are paying the fees for SC Students to affiliated universities and boards from their own pocket without charging fees from them as per directions of the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/can-t-pay-staff-salaries-due-to-delay-in-release-of-post-matric-scholarships-says-punjab-unaided-colleges-association/story-L5WuqZ1sEYZLo0aOa6hOcM.html

They said it was due to the callous attitude of the hospital that the nurse came into contact with the virus.“She (the nurse) had been complaining of fever and cough for the past one week and had requested for leave. But, she was forced to attend duty. Despite being tested positive, she was on duty on Sunday and it was after her reports arrived that the authorities woke up from the slumber and quarantined her and her family,” said ward helper Nanak Singh.“We do not know how many of us would have been infected. Now, the authorities have ‘locked’ the fellow nurses in the hospital,” he added.‘DOCTORS PROTECTED, NURSES NEGLECTED’The protesters also accused the hospital of protecting doctors and neglecting the nursing staff.Another ward helper Hardeep Singh said, “We are treated like second-rate citizens as if our life does not matter. When we demanded N-95 masks and PPE kits, we were given cotton gowns. There is discrimination in everything. Threats are being given to deduct our salaries. Our annual leave has also been cancelled.” Staff nurse Gurpreet Kaur said, “The strong lobby of doctors is helping each other and oppressing the nursing staff. Doctors are not even visiting the hospital and are, instead, treating patients through video calls. If some doctors come to the hospital, they do not go even near patients and tell us to diagnose them.”Dr Parveen Sobti, director of the hospital, however, said the paramedical staff were being provided protective gears as per the direction of the ICMR.She said it was not yet clear whether the nurse came into contact with the virus in the hospital or outside.“We have not locked anyone forcibly. Colleagues of infected patients have been quarantined as a preventive measure and their reports are awaited,” said Dr Sobti.She added that discussions were on with the staff and the matter would be resolved soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-hospital-nurse-tests-covid-19-positive-paramedical-staff-hold-protest/story-9q2KlS6a11Hc1StDwfZofN.html

The market committee has allowed only around 150 listed vendors to enter the market. The arhtiyas, however, also call their unauthorised customers, including street vendors, to the market and they enter the market through different ways, which results in a rush of visitors.”District mandi officer (DMO) Jaswinder Dhaliwal said, “The market committee staff and the police are taking action against the visitors violating the social distancing norm and not wearing masks. We are also planning to shift the retail vendors, who install their vends inside the mandi, to another site to avoid rush in the market.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-visitors-to-ludhiana-s-main-vegetable-market-ignoring-precautions/story-h2n2gx6QMzu4qay8fAqsgO.html

22-06-2020||Delhi||Doctors protest working conditions at ESI hospital||Between Sunday night and Monday morning, the doctor on duty at the emergency ward of the 200-bed ESI Hospital in northwest Delhi’s Rohini Sector 15 attended patients outside in the open compound. The senior resident had set up his desk, chair and a bed outside the emergency wing, even as it rained, as a mark of protest against the inadequate facilities at the hospital, including a non-functional air conditioning system and unhygienic conditions in the duty room.Doctors in the emergency wing, which receives at least 70-80 patients throughout the day, say it is unbearable to sit in the stuffy room in hot and humid conditions for 13-14 hours with the personal protective equipment (PPE) coveralls on. They have been working in such conditions for almost three months now.The hospital is not a dedicated Covid-19 facility but has two isolation wards for suspected and stable cases to observe and test them. If patients test positive or develop any kind of complication, they are referred to Covid-19 hospitals or other Covid-19 care facilities depending on the case.“I moved my workstation outside when I could no longer breathe properly inside the room. Doctors on duty can fall unconscious in such circumstances. Besides attending to emergency patients and taking rounds, we are required to check on patients in Covid-19 isolation wards. We have to make notes, take samples, make files and discharge reports of patients sitting in the duty room, which has no ventilation and is poorly kept,” Dr Shashank Srivastava, who sat outside through the night until his shift got over at 9.30am on Monday, said.Even as it rained heavily in the morning, Srivastava saw 8-10 patients. “I made sure they stood under the roof and I checked them right outside the emergency entry. Two of them came with Covid-like symptoms. Only after that the hospital administration asked me to move inside and assured me they’d look into the issues,” Srivastava said.Another senior resident doctor, who did not wish to be named, said that since April, they have been requesting the hospital administration to at least fix the air-conditioner but to no avail. “It is just not humanly possible to wear the PPE kit for so long and sit in that room without falling sick. Also, there is a staff crunch and work hours tend to get stretched. Having proper ventilation and clean surroundings is the least we could ask for,” he said.Against the sanctioned strength of 8-9 senior residents to be posted in the emergency wing, only three doctors are there at present, the doctor quoted above said. “There were five doctors until earlier this month, after which two moved out to join services elsewhere. Now, there are only three of us, while there are no junior residents,” he said.The doctors said they will continue to work outside if their issues are not addressed at the earliest.According to officials in the hospital administration, the medical superintendent met emergency doctors on Monday morning and assured them they would address the issues at the soonest.However, the medical superintendent did not respond for comment despite repeated calls and texts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/doctors-protest-working-conditions-at-esi-hospital/story-i4zGFBMocGogLzu2XccetK.html
22-06-2020||City||Three civil defence volunteers hurt in attack by residents of containment zone||New Delhi: Three civil defence volunteers were injured in a clash with residents of a containment zone in West Delhi’s Naraina on Sunday afternoon over distribution of food packets, the police said after registering a first information report (FIR) and arresting a man.Deepak Purohit, the deputy commissioner of police (west), said while a quarrel over serving of food is said to be the reason for the violence. The police also received complaints from some residents that the quarrel began after the volunteers were accused of selectively letting out some people from the sealed zone.DCP Purohit said the clash happened around 12.15 pm on Sunday while food packets were being distributed to the needy in the containment zone. “According to the volunteers, some residents demanded non-vegetarian food, which wasn’t available. The volunteers then said they should be allowed to leave the containment zone. That led to a group of 10-12 residents turning violent,” the officer said. They allegedly tore off a tin sheet meant to seal entry and exit points of the containment zone and beat up the volunteers. “Three volunteers were injured in the incident. They are out of danger,” the officer said. The police registered a case of assault and disobeying an order given by a public servant. One of the alleged attackers, Sampurnanand Bharti, was arrested from the spot itself after the volunteers called the police for help. “Bharti’s mother and another woman were involved in the attack. We will arrest them also soon,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-civil-defence-volunteers-hurt-in-attack-by-residents-of-containment-zone/story-pUgkopfI6EReLc1B9MttdJ.html
22-06-2020||Delhi||Allow pvt labs to use rapid antigen tests: HC to govt||The Delhi High Court on Monday asked the Delhi government why it was not allowing private labs or private hospitals dealing with Covid-19 patients to conduct rapid antigen tests, which might ease their work, while also observing that the government had failed to meet its own target of conducting 22,000 rapid antigen tests in 11 districts of the city every day.A bench of justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad said that it was “abysmal” for the government to set such estimates after the Delhi government additional standing counsel Satyakam said that they had targeted conducting 22,000 rapid antigen tests per day (2,000 tests in each of the 11 districts), only in the containment zones.Advocate Satyakam, the additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, told the court that on June 18, a total of 15,012 samples were collected in Delhi, of which 7,040 samples were tested through the rapid antigen detection test and 7,972 through the RT-PCR test. He submitted that as on June 21, 13,345 samples were collected, of which 9,356 samples were tested through the rapid antigen test and 3,989 samples through the RT-PCR test.To this, the court said, “This is even less than 50% of the estimated amount. Your estimates should be reasonable. Why can’t you allow antigen testing in all private places?” Rakesh Malhotra, the advocate for the petitioner, also submitted that patients coming to the emergency department should also be tested using the antigen method.The counsel for the Delhi government sought time from the court stating that the new testing procedure has been started on a trial basis and a week’s time be given to understand its functioning.The court was hearing a plea filed by a lawyer, Sanjeev Sharma, through his counsel Rakesh Malhotra, who contended that there have been several instances where non-Covid patients needing surgery or other procedures were asked to undergo testing, but the hospital concerned did not conduct the test since they did not have the government’s permission.The government also filed a status report in the matter addressing several issues raised by some private labs. In the report, it said that Sir Ganga Ram Hospital “insisted on being treated differently” while blaming the hospital for its non-registration on the RT-PCR portal.the government said that the reason for the hospital’s non-registration on the RT-PCR portal was that the hospital had issues with human resources as its employees were not able to report for work due to travel restrictions imposed by neighbouring states.“It was sheer reluctance on the part of the hospital to follow guidelines; in fact, they stopped processing samples only after an FIR was filed, and not after the notice dated June 3. The hospital, curiously, wanted an exception by virtue of being a big hospital while advocating that the rules be followed by “small labs”. The hospital only relented after the government was forced to take stringent measures in the form of an FIR,” the government told the court.The government report said that it was compelled to take action and after adequate assurance and action, the lab has been permitted to process samples.“A similar order in respect of other labs were remedied within three days but for this establishment, because it insisted on being treated differently. It is submitted that the action taken by the government was imperative as it is the duty of the government to ensure compliance of the rules and guidelines…[sic],” the report read.The Delhi government also told the court that private labs in the city had promised to test 7,220 samples per day, however, they have been testing only 2,030 samples per day. On the last date of hearing (June 19), the court had asked the committee constituted by lieutenant governer Anil Baijal to look into the grievances of the private labs.The court directed that fresh affidavits be filed by the concerned authorities and posted the matter for hearing on June 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/allow-pvt-labs-to-use-rapid-antigen-tests-hc-to-govt/story-f53N4bkKbTItNhVIgJKyjO.html
22-06-2020||City||Nepal blocking anti-flood measures, Bihar seeks Centre’s help||MuzaffarpurWith the monsoon picking up and Nepal creating hurdles in the anti-erosion work on its side, an alarmed Bihar government has written to the Centre to take up the matter with the Nepalese authorities for special permission to complete the remaining flood protection work on the Gandak barrage and the embankment along Lal Bakeya river, which originates from the neighbouring country and cuts through parts of north Bihar.During peak monsoon season, rivers flowing from Nepal into downstream Bihar have been a bane for the state, as it happened last year and also during the Kosi disaster of 2008, when the Kosi river breached its embankment in Nepal.As preventive measures, Bihar has been repairing embankments on such rivers in Nepal itself every year. This year, however, Nepalese authorities have refused to allow flood prevention work.Bihar’s water resources minister Sanjay Kumar Jha on Monday wrote to minister for external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat to intervene at their level and talk with the Nepalese counterparts to resolve the issue.“The work on the Gandak barrage is crucial. It has 18 gates on the Indian side and 18 on the Nepal side. For decades, Bihar’s water resources department has been carrying out restoration work on both sides. There has never been any issue. But this time, Nepal has put up barriers to prevent anti-erosion work on their side,” Jha said.Jha said that even on Saturday, there was discharge of 1.50 lakh cusecs of water from the barrage and in case of heavy rain, heavy pressure could lead to breach. “For plugging the breach and monitoring the situation, WRD officials and engineers have been going there every year with equipment and material, but this is the first time Nepal side has objected to it,” he has said in the letter.Similarly, the minister said, on the ride side embankment on the Lal Bakeya river, work has been stopped for about 500 metres connecting India with Nepal. “Nepalese authorities are claiming it to be no-man’s land, while there have never been any issue here in the last 30 years,” he said.In April, the Nepal government had given its nod to the Centre for carrying out anti-erosion work on its side in the midst of lockdown. The Bihar government had taken up the matter with the Centre after there were hurdles created in carrying out routine anti-erosion work at vulnerable points on the Kosi river before monsoon.Meanwhile, India’s Sashashtra Seema Bal (SSB), which guards the Indo-Nepal border, has denied permission to Nepalese for repairing the left flank of the embankment on Lal Bakeya river near Tikulia village under Bairgania block in Sitamarhi district.“The left flank of the embankment was breached for nearly 150 metres by floods in 2019. It has to be repaired by the end of May this year. We tried to repair it so that it does not damage harm human lives or standing crops. But our efforts have gone in vain as SSB officials has stopped us,” said Ajay Kumar Gupta, mayor of Gaur Nagarpalika of Rautahat district in Nepal.Pramod Rai, a resident of Tikulia village in Indian territory, said Indians would benefit more if the embankment is repaired. “Once the embankment will be repaired, the standing crop in nearly 10,000 hectares would be saved from floods. We have already informed the district administration as well officials from water resource department (WRD), which is responsible for its maintenance since its inception. But they are silent,” said Rai.When contacted, Suresh Kumar Ram, sub-divisional officer of the WRD at Bairgania, said he could do nothing until ordered by his superiors. “I have informed our superiors and waiting for their response,” he said.Sitamarhi’s district magistrate Abhilasha Kumari Sharma could not be contacted despite several attempts.Division commissioner Pankaj Kumar said he was not aware of the matter. “I will seek information from the DM and officials concerned from the WRD,” he said.India’s ties with Nepal have, of late, turned for the worse after the Himalayan neighbour staked claim on Indian territories. Earlier this month, an Indian was killed by the Nepalese guards at the border in Sitamarhi border, a first such incident in the area.

22-06-2020||Kolkata||‘Why this apathy’: TMC questions Centre on excluding Bengal from migrants’ employment scheme||The Trinamool Congress on Monday questioned the Centre’s criterion for selecting districts to be covered under the recently-launched Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan and sought an answer as to why West Bengal has been left out of the scheme.Abhishek Banerjee, senior party leader and nephew of Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, posted a tweet on Monday afternoon questioning the Modi government’s “apathy towards the people of Bengal.”“Shri @narendramodi Ji, why have you blatantly ignored the concerns of 11 Lakh migrant workers from #Bengal who’ve recently returned to their homes. Why has WB been left out of the Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan? Why this apathy towards the people of Bengal?” tweeted Banerjee. Shri @narendramodi Ji, why have you blatantly ignored the concerns of 11 Lakh migrant workers from #Bengal who’ve recently returned to their homes. Why has WB been left out of the Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan? Why this apathy towards the people of Bengal? https://t.co/wW86ntqCoVThe Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan was launched on June 20 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to provide employment to migrant workers affected by the Covid-19 lockdown,. It will cover 116 districts spread across six states - Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha. All these districts have received more than 25,000 migrant workers during the lockdown.Bengal’s Panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee alleged that the state had been left out “intentionally”.“The Centre could have simply checked the details provided by people who returned to Bengal in the Shramik Special trains. It is apparent that Bengal was left out intentionally,” said Mukherjee.On Sunday, TMC’s member of Parliament Mahua Moitra had also criticised the Centre. “Much hyped Garib Kalyan Rojgar Yojana sounds suspiciously like watered down version of MNREGA,” Moitra had tweeted.The ruling TMC is not the only party in the state to have criticised the Centre and the Bharatiya Janata Party on this issue.CPM politburo member Md Salim believes this is a “mock fight between the TMC and the BJP.”“The BJP government has never catered to the interests of the poor so this is not a surprise. Since the assembly polls will be held next year, this will add to the mock fight between the TMC and BJP. The BJP is not bothered about employment,” he said.Defending the Centre’s decision to not include Bengal in the scheme, party national secretary Rahul Sinha hit back at the state government, saying it had “never shown any interest in the welfare of the poor.”“The TMC government has not implemented important Central schemes such as Ayushman Bharat that benefits the poor. This government was reluctant to call back migrant workers and treated them with apathy once they came home. Has the TMC government ever shown any interest in welfare of the poor?” said Sinha.The issue of Bengal’s exclusion from the scheme is likely to figure at an all-party meeting that CM Banerjee has called on Wednesday to discuss the Covid-19 crisis and related issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/why-this-apathy-tmc-questions-centre-on-excluding-bengal-from-migrants-employment-scheme/story-zNYHMG4s9XZpfX50429C8I.html

He had allegedly assured Kumar that he would help him get his sister Pooja’s in-laws arrested after she lodged an FIR against them for aborting her pregnancy on April 7, 2019, at the Shimlapuri Police station. Mishra had taken ₹50,000 from Kumar to get a chargesheet filed against them.Teja said investigations had also revealed that Mishra had taken ₹2lakh from Jatinder Kumar for police protection to carry out sand mining and ₹70,000 from Sandeep Sharma for illegal lottery trade.Inspector Amandeep Singh Brar, SHO at Shimlapuri police said a case under sections 384 (extortion), 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC has been registered against the accused.

22-06-2020||Chandigarh||Passengers wary of letting anyone touch their luggage, say porters at Chandigarh railway station||With just two passenger trains making a stop here, porters at the Chandigarh railway station are struggling to find work, especially as passengers are now wary of letting anyone touch their luggage, fearing the spread of Covid-19. “We used to earn around Rs 500 a day in off-season. Now, we are lucky even if we earn Rs 50 a day,” says Vijay Meena, one of the two presidents of the porters’ body at the station. He says that seven of the total 39 porters at the station have already left for their hometowns and those who are left behind are struggling to make ends meet. “I barely have any money to pay my house rent, which has been due for the past four months, and now I am unsure if I will even be able to send my children to school this year,” Meena says. Most of the porters live close to the station in Daria village, Manimajra and Mauli Jagran. Divided into two groups of 15, the porters work on alternate days, taking precautions such as wearing masks and sanitising their hands.But rarely finding any work, most of them sit in a room allotted to them near the parking. Sawar Khan, the other president of the porters’ body, says that people are reluctant to hire porters as they don’t want anyone handling their luggage amid the Covid-19 outbreak. Another reason, he says, is that the trains line up on platform number one, from where people can easily drag their luggage to the exit. “We would get more work if the two trains, Jan Shatabdi and Paschim Express, line up on other platforms.” RAILWAY AUTHORITIES MULLING COVID NEGATIVE CARDS FOR PORTERSSympathising with their condition, station superintendent of the Chandigarh Railway station, Anil Aggarwal said, “We are thinking of making cards for porters assuring people they are Covid negative after screening them at the railway hospital so that people are more confident of hiring them.” He added that the railway authorities were also helping the porters and Northern Railways Women’s Welfare Organisation had recently provided ration to 35 porters a week ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/passengers-wary-of-letting-anyone-touch-their-luggage-say-porters-at-chandigarh-railway-station/story-Kbc0ijbGGB7NmsD78RIsCI.html

Currently, the only private lab in the city that has authorisation for conducting the test, SRL Laboratory, charges Rs 4,500 per patient.The UT officials, led by adviser Manoj Kumar Parida, met the representatives of SRL Laboratory on Monday, as per the directions of the Indian Council of Medical Research.“After taking into account the cost of kits and consumables and on the basis of procedure in other states, UT administration, in exercise of the powers bestowed under the Epidemic Diseases Act, directed that no private laboratory should charge more than Rs 2,000 for Covid-19 test, inclusive of GST/taxes, if any,” said a UT official privy to the development.The prescribed cost would include the cost involved in pick up, packing and transportation of samples, documentation and reporting in UT, the official added.For conducting the test, the lab requires three documents from a person requesting Covid test -- prescription for Covid-19 test from a qualified physician, government photo-id and duly filled specimen referral form.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-test-at-chandigarh-s-private-labs-capped-at-rs-2-000/story-exykafALBw2z4AlS531muI.html
22-06-2020||Mumbai||Low-intensity rain to continue, heavy showers not expected till weekend: IMD||The city is likely to witness intermittent light to moderate rain spells over the week but intense heavy showers are not expected till the weekend, the weather bureau said.The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) district rainfall forecast for the next four days showed light to moderate rain for Tuesday followed by very light to light rain from Wednesday to Friday.“Reduction in rain intensity is due to the lack of prominent weather systems developing over Bay of Bengal that aids the monsoon current, strong wind pattern and allows the offshore trough to be active. However, none of these factors are there at the moment for the Konkan coast, especially the Mumbai region,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, IMD director-general. “Over the next four to five days we are not expecting any intense rain activity for the Mumbai region.”So far there has been only one intense rain spell on June 18 that led to 41 mm rain in the suburbs and 44 mm in south Mumbai. After that, only sporadic showers mostly during the night or early morning have been witnessed.Between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm Monday, south Mumbai 5.2 mm rain while negligible rain was recorded in the suburbs. Over the last 24 hours (8.30 am Sunday and 8.30 am Monday), 12.5 mm was recorded in the suburbs and 0.6 mm in south Mumbai.After a lull in rain intensity, total rain recorded so far since June 1 was 7.3 mm below normal or deficient rain for the suburbs. The Santacruz weather station has so far recorded 303.4 mm rain against the normal of 310.7 mm for the period June 1 to June 22. However, south Mumbai has recorded 26.3 mm excess rain with 369.5 mm against the normal of 343.2 mm for the period.Independent meteorologists said the Mumbai Metropolitan Region would witness sultry weather throughout the week along with a partly cloudy sky. “There will be passing light rain until June 23, following which further reduction in the rain activity will occur. Showers might increase during the weekend,” said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom adding that the offshore trough (weather system) had weakened. “There is a significant reduction in moisture levels over Mumbai. In addition, a break-monsoon type situation (period when intense monsoon rainfall activity shifts to the foothills of the Himalayas) is expected in India this week, which would keep rainfall in Maharashtra (including Mumbai) on the lower side,” said Deoras.The maximum temperature in the suburbs was 2 degrees Celsius above normal at 33.3 degrees Celsius while the minimum temperature was 25.6 degrees Celsius, a degree Celsius below normal. South Mumbai recorded 32.8 degrees Celsius as the maximum temperature and 27.7 degrees Celsius as the minimum, both a degree Celsius above normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/low-intensity-rain-to-continue-heavy-showers-not-expected-till-weekend-imd/story-MgCwXprP1bDwVxZQBSVTDK.html

22-06-2020||Chandigarh||SAD chief urges Centre to bring down fuel prices||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday urged the Union government to bring down fuel prices to give much needed relief to farmers, industry and common man.Punjab government should also roll back the hike in state VAT on fuel, he said.In a statement here, the SAD chief said the huge hike in fuel prices over the last 16 days was causing a lot of stress to the country’s economy which was still reeling from the effects of Covid-19 lockdown. He said the consecutive hike had made petrol dearer by ₹9.21 per litre and diesel costlier by ₹8.55 per litre.He said pricier fuel had hurt farmers and common man the most. He said farmers were already bearing a huge increase in labour charges for transplantation of paddy, and now had to reckon with an unprecedented hike in fuel prices.Sukhbir said the Congress government should also reverse the hike in state VAT on fuel in the interest of consumers. He said the state had affected an increase of ₹3.20 per litre in the price of petrol and ₹2.53 per litre for diesel.“In view of this scenario, the government should come out with a financial package to revive the economy, but instead it is putting fresh burden on the people. The hike in state VAT on fuel should be withdrawn immediately,” he demanded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-chief-urges-centre-to-bring-down-fuel-prices/story-MMMKtOkKlGYzycCRgnys6L.html

22-06-2020||City||Punjab-origin landlord billed £16,000 as illegal unit’s demolition cost in UK||The Ealing Council has handed a Punjab-origin landlord in Southall a £16,000 bill after it demolished an illegally constructed structure in his property that he refused to dismantle after being requested to do so by the council over two years.Rapinder Sehajpal has been described by the council as a ‘slum landlord’, which refers to landlords letting out parts of their properties illegally to tenants in conditions that may or may not be hygienic.It said on Monday that Sehajpal now owes the council £16,000 as the cost of demolishing the illegal outbuilding in her property.“The 45-square-metre outbuilding had been built without planning permission and then illegally let to a family. The demolition came after several rounds of legal interventions by the council over a two-year period were disregarded by Sehajpal,” the council said.The council began the proceedings after receiving a tip-off in May 2017. The owner was issued planning enforcement notice and after several exchanges and warning letters, the structure was knocked down by the council.Councillor Joanna Camadoo-Rothwell, the council’s lead member for community safety and inclusion, said: “This gentleman chose to ignore repeated requests to obey the law, continuing to rent out this illegally-built outhouse. It is totally unacceptable in a modern, civilised society for a cramped building at the bottom of a garden to be used as a family home.”“As we have seen in many cases across the capital, illegal outbuildings are damaging to our neighbourhoods and pose a very real health hazard for those living in them. I am therefore pleased to see a robust approach to enforcement in this case, with Sehajpal paying a heavy price for flouting planning regulations,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-origin-landlord-billed-16-000-as-illegal-unit-s-demolition-cost-in-uk/story-dINQ25aYEIMbFOrKF3cJmK.html

22-06-2020||Chandigarh||Dining out gradually picking pace at Chandigarh’s restaurants||Two weeks after the administration allowed eateries to resume dine-in services, restaurateurs say more customers were now coming in to eat out.As per the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the UT administration, restaurants were allowed to open from June 8 with an 8pm deadline and only 50% capacity to maintain 6 feet distance between customers. Tables have to be sanitised before every new customer, and use of disposable menus and contactless payment has been encouraged.Neeraj Bajaj, proprietor of Sindhi Sweets and president of the Chandigarh Business Council, said, “There is about a 30% increase in patrons, but several more were unable to come in due to weekend restrictions in Punjab.”On the sales’ front, he said people were overall definitely spending lesser on the total bill.In Sector 10, the dine-in business is thriving as most outlets here have opened now. Annu Bains, proprietor of Brooklyn Central here, said, “The number of customers is gradually going up. We have a loyal clientele that is venturing out more and preferring dine-in over takeaway or home delivery.”Joint owner of Nik Bakers, Nitin Mittal said, “Once all restaurants reopen, normalcy will be restored. So, it’s important for the businesses to stay open.” The 8pm deadline is however eating into the sales of some restaurants. Pal Dhaba in Sector 28 is doing better on home deliveries compared to dine-ins. “People don’t venture out in the summer before 8pm. It’s impractical to expect customers to visit a dhaba in the searing heat,” said proprietor Amit Pal Singh.Meanwhile, several restaurants are still not providing dine-in services. “More eateries will open up fully when more customers feel comfortable in stepping out of their houses,” said Ankit Gupta, president of the Chandigarh Hospitality Association, and owner of Himani’s Vertigo Lounge in Sector 35, where they are offering only home delivery and takeaway for now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dining-out-gradually-picking-pace-at-chandigarh-s-restaurants/story-WnjgcS4L6YVKhr3PFp3nUM.html
22-06-2020||City||Frequent mobile internet gags during militant encounters irk Kashmiri students||The frequent suspension of 2G internet during militant encounters in Kashmir has irked college and university students who are appearing in their online internal examinations these days.Already bearing the brunt of slow speed internet during the Covid-19 lockdown, the student community said snapping of mobile internet whenever a gunfight takes place between militants and security forces, leaves their examination schedules in disarray.Majid Lone of Islamia College of Science and Commerce (ICSC), Srinagar, woke up to no cellular internet service on Sunday as an encounter had started in Zadibal area of the city. “When I made some calls, I came to know about the encounter and postponement of the exams. Mobile internet was suspended in south Kashmir on Thursday and Friday too after encounters erupted there,” he said.While three militants were killed in Zadibal encounter on Sunday, eight militants were killed on Thursday and Friday in two separate gun battles in south Kashmir’s Pulwama and Shopian districts. A militant was also killed in Kulgam on Saturday. Another encounter erupted in Anantnag on Monday.A computer science student of Islamic University of Science and Technology (IUST) in Pulwama district said their internal viva exams were scheduled online on Thursday when the internet was suddenly snapped.“Out of 80, barely three students managed to give the exam. The whole schedule got disrupted as the internet was restored on Saturday when the exams were held again,” she said.IUST student Abrar Ahmad, who is doing his BTech in electronics and communication engineering, said students were suffering a lot due to the internet issues in the valley. “Our exam was scheduled on Sunday, but due to internet suspension it could not be held. Our next paper is on Tuesday, so the university may squeeze in the rescheduled exam a day before or after, which adds to our burden,” he said.Kashmir divisional commissioner Pandurang K Pole said, “We try to localise internet suspension in rural areas, but in the city, there are technological constraints.

22-06-2020||City||Patti-Makhu rail link hanging fire for 7 years||TARN TARAN Seven years after the rail budget of 2013 gave the green signal to the Rs 1,000 crore, 25km Patti-Makhu link to connect the Majha and Malwa regions of the state, the project has been hanging fire for want of clarity on land acquisition among the Centre and the state. Each wanted the other to buy land. The railways had cleared about ₹300 crore for the project during 2017-18. In March 2019, the state government had sanctioned ₹40 crore for land acquisition.Farmers stand to benefit from the link as they could send vegetable and fruit to markets in Mumbai and Gujarat much faster. The distance between Amritsar and Mumbai will reduce by 240km, as the project will also link Punjab with the trade capitals of Gujarat and Maharashtra. The project will also reduce distance between Amritsar and Ferozepur from the present 118km to 86km.Around 165 acre land will be acquired for the project — 70 acre by Tarn Taran administration, and 95 acre by Ferozepur administration — between Gharyala railway station on the Amritsar-Khemkaran line at Patti in Tarn Taran and Mallanwala railway station on the Ferozepur-Jalandhar line in Makhu.The project had got a lease of life in February this year with the Punjab government announcing that it would start the process of Social Impact Assessment (SIA) for acquiring land, but the lockdown due to covid-19 stalled the plan. In the most recent development, the administration, on Tuesday, will write a letter to experts to begin the process of SIA. “The SIA was to be conducted by a team of experts from a particular university, but it could not be started due to the lockdown,” said Rajesh Sharma, Patti SDM, who is also the competent authority for land acquisition. BJP Rajya Sabha MP from Amritsar Shwait Malik said, “The project is being delayed deliberately. The state government had sanctioned Rs 40 crore for land acquisition, but has failed to release the funds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patti-makhu-rail-link-hanging-fire-for-7-years/story-ar6L73s6YN9lzCMv2py6WM.html

22-06-2020||Chandigarh||PSPCL in trouble as govt holds back subsidies for free power to farm sector||The government’s failure to pay subsidy to the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to make good its free power promise to the agriculture sector is draining the coffers of the corporation.Not paid the subsidy for the last five fiscals, PSPCL is taking loans from banks to survive. It has as of now taken a loan of ₹500 crore and is planning to apply again for ₹ 260 crore as demand peaks in summer. According to information available with Hindustan Times, till June 15, out of the ₹3,923 crore subsidy it had to pay, the Punjab government gave ₹1,840 crore in cash to PSPCL.“Both PSPCL and Punjab Government are in a vicious circle over subsidy and interest payment. In the recent tariff order, the power regulator has imposed ₹418 crore interest on the Punjab government for delayed/partial payment of subsidy to PSPCL. At the same time, due to non-payment of full subsidy, PSPCL is taking loans to meet its expenses and paying interest to banks. Both PSPCL and Punjab government are paying interest, but ultimately this money comes from the pocket of the public”, said a power engineer who did not wish to be named.What the government will do about this year’s bill of ₹16,400 crore amid the Covid-19 pandemic is anybody’s guess.When contacted, A Venu Prasad, chairman-cum-managing director (CMD), PSPCL, said the corporation was getting a much better amount in subsidy than in previous years, but it was “not enough” as most of PSPCL’s power was purchased in summer. This meant that teh corporation had to make maximum payments during summer. “To meet the shortfall, we have take a loan of ₹500 crore and another Rs. 260 will be needed,” he added.BOXPSPCL gets cheap power from GridWith power available for cheaper rates at the National Grid because of lower demand in India, PSPCL purchased 100 MW power each day on Saturday and Sunday from it. Thanks to the efforts of CMD A Venu Prasad the Northern Grid too has allowed PSPCL to import 200 MW additional power. “PSPCL is cutting down operational costs by purchasing cheap power from grid whenever possible,” Prasad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pspcl-faces-financial-crunch-as-govt-holds-back-subsidies-for-free-power-to-farm-sector/story-Z0iFx14AFbDQdfuRH3Iq8N.html

They were kept in detention for 12 hours and beaten up with rods and lathis and made to drink dirty water.According to sources, the three officials who accompanied Selvadhas and Brahma are on leave and will return to work.According to officials at the Integrated Check Post (ICP), Attari, which facilitates India’s trade with Pakistan and Afghanistan and movement of passengers from India to Pakistan and vice-a-versa, injury marks were visible on Selvadhas and Brahma.They were taken away in a separate vehicle from the ICP, which was escorted by a team of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), while the three other staff members left the ICP in another car.Sources said the high commission of India had written to the ministry of foreign affairs (MFA) in Islamabad for the movement of the five officials via Wagah on June 18. The MFA had granted permission on June 19.The two staffers were interrogated regarding the role and function of all high commission officials.Reports in the Pakistani media claimed that the Indian officials had been arrested after their car allegedly hit a pedestrian near the diplomatic enclave. The Indian officials had said that their kidnappers made multiple videos in which the two staffers were forced to confess under duress that they were involved in the accident.The two men were handed back to the Indian high commission at 9pm on June 15.

We slowly repaired and rebuilt our houses. Despite no Covid case in our colony, neither the PMC nor the state government officials have built a retaining wall. We are on our own,” said Sanjay Shinde, a resident of Tangewala colony. “The sharp curves on the canal caused damage in last year’s Ambil Odha tragedy. When water flows in force, it flows straight, can’t take turns. These unnatural turns on the canal are very dangerous. The PMC should look into it”, said Nitin Kadam, resident and NCP president of Parvati constituency.Residents of Katraj, where the Ambil Odha originates, and the worst-affected area along with Sahakarnagar, said no work has been carried out by civic body in the area.Kishore Jadhav, a resident of Katraj, said, “Because of the flash floods along the Odha, water entered our houses. We have repeatedly demanded that the walls along the stream be re-built before this year’s monsoon. Nothing has been done. Now, the rains have started and we live in fear… if there is heavy rain we will have to run out of our houses just like last year.”Bairobha nallah resident Sangeeta Ghorpade said, “Our lives were destroyed by the flash floods last year, and this year too, the rains are likely to impact our area. We request the authorities to carry out proper cleaning of the nallah and construct the protective wall without fail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/re-living-the-monsoon-as-a-nightmare-waiting-to-become-a-dark-reality-again/story-HFzlKIS3c2bDGE5K1O0tCM.html

22-06-2020||Pune||Monsoon woes, part 1: Why Pune not ready for repeat of 2019 rain fury||Residents of Sahakarnagar in particular, and the areas of Katraj, Sinhgad road, Satara road, Kondhwa, Camp, Wanowrie, Bairobha nallah and Bibwewadi, in the intervening night of September 25-26, 2019, faced flash floods from an overwhelming outpouring of monsoon rain. These residents fear a repeat of the flood fury, as work on Ambil Odha, a stream that burst its banks, has only been partially completed.An overflowing Ambil Odha – it originates at Katraj lake and flows six kilometres through the city to merge with the Mutha river –claimed 26 lives and damaged public and private property on a scale had not witnessed in Pune in decades. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), post the 2019 monsoon disaster, said it would spend Rs 300 crore, primarily, to build a retaining wall along the Ambil Odha and repair sections where the bank and barriers had collapsed. On the ground though, work on the retaining wall hasn’t begun and the civic body has only partially completed its pre-monsoon cleaning of drains and nallahs.2019’s flash floods were borne out of incessant rainfall and came without forecast or warning. The city received 100 mm rainfall in just two hours.During the flash floods, residential societies located in Katraj, Sahakarnagar, Padmavati, Ambegaon and Sinhgad road were the worst-affected as flood water entered societies, shanties and houses situated in low-lying areas. At least 2,700 vehicles – two- three- and four-wheelers - were destroyed or washed away from these localities; such was the current and depth of water over-flowing.The 2020 monsoon has begun and Pune has already completed its June quota of normal rainfall – 151.6mm in 20 days received, as against the normal mark being 137mm.The cash-strapped Pune civic body, during the first week of November 2019, had cleared a proposal to build a three-km retaining wall with culverts at 45 locations along the affected areas of the stream at an estimated cost of Rs 78 crore, for which a tender was passed. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic reached Pune in March, no work on Ambil Odha had begun.PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, who recently visited the flood-hit areas, said, “We have so far completed construction of the retaining wall at three places, though at most locations where there are housing societies, PMC will not be able to build walls. To ensure the city does not witnesses a flash-flood like incident, PMC has cleaned Ambil Odha and constructed new outlets for Katraj lake. These outlets will allow discharge of water automatically once the lake starts filling up in the monsoon.” Pune’s member of parliament (MP), Girish Bapat of the BJP said, “I had taken review meeting of the issue with the PMC commissioner and it was decided to earmark funds for the work. Right now due to the corona crisis, adequate work has not been done. However, I had directed deeper cleaning of nallahs and stormwater drains for facilitating smooth flow of rain water.” Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “We have spent ~100 crore on battling the Covid-19 crisis and currently no additional funds are available . Walls must be constructed, but it would require ~70 crore. The state must fund the project.”Ground realityPMC officials on the ground have accepted that work along the Ambil Odha, and other affected areas, has not been completed.Kanhaiylal Harilal Lakhani, ward officer, Dhankawadi- Sahakar nagar ward office, said “Ambil Odha’s cleaning work has been stopped now due to the monsoon. The construction of the retaining wall work is yet to be completed, as the administration is looking into the matter.”Sambhji Khot, ward officer, Sinhgad road, said, “We could complete works worth Rs 10 lakh, only. Currently, 10 per cent of the work is complete and lots still needs to done. We have a limit of Rs 25 lakh and the current work of constructing a retaining wall and other flood prevention measures will cost crores of rupees. A lot of work needs to be completed and it is being directly done by the PMC administration.”Santosh Warule, ward officer, Warje, said, “Most affected areas had private fencing which fell down during the deluge.

22-06-2020||Delhi||Pulse oximeter for home quarantined Covid-19 patients in Delhi: CM Kejriwal||Noting that one of the problems being faced by coronavirus patients in home isolation is the sudden drop in oxygen levels, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday that all those patients will be provided pulse oximeters to monitor their oxygen levels. Coronavirus affects the respiratory system leading to breathlessness and all those patients will be regularly monitored by teams through calls and be provided assistance with oximeters to help them stabilise. “The Delhi government will provide pulse oximeters to all home quarantine cases,” said the CM at a press conference today. He added once the patient has recovered, the oximeters can be returned.Experts too have recommended the use of this relatively cheap device at home that can forewarn you about any impending crisis. A pulse-oximeter costs between Rs 1,000 to 3,000.As reported by HT earlier, the government is procuring 1 lakh pulse-oximeters - a small clip-on device that has to be attached to the finger-tip to check the amount of oxygen in the body. Current guidelines say that Covid-19 patients have to be admitted to hospitals if their oxygen saturation drops to 90% or below (normal is 95 to 100%).The CM informed that there are 25,000 active Covid-19 cases in Delhi and around 12,000 people are presently under home isolation. The testing has increased by three times in the city, the CM said, adding from 5,000 tests per day, it is now around 18,000 per day. He asserted that people will not face any issues in getting tested in the city.Appreciating the support extended by the Central government in Delhi’s fight against Covid-19, Kejriwal reiterated that this is not the time to do politics or fight among each other. “If we do not unite, coronavirus will win,” he said.At a meeting chaired by home minister Amit Shah on Sunday it was decided that contact tracing would be scaled up in the city-state and would be diligently followed for all Covid-19 patients using the Aarogya Setu app.There will be fresh delineation of containment zones in Delhi and a serological survey will be carried out from June 27 to ascertain the scale of the spread of the infectious disease in the city, the MHA said in a statement.Amit Shah, according to a statement by the home ministry, has further directed that there should be an analysis pertaining to every deceased person, including the number of days he was in hospital and his place of residence; whether the person was in home isolation or being treated in a hospital. Emphasising earlier that coronavirus positive patients do recover from the highly infectious disease, Kejriwal had said “more than 80 per cent of coronavirus positive patients either have no symptoms at all and most people recover in about 17 days if they follow proper home isolation guidelines”. The CM had urged people not to panic if they test Covid-19 positive and follow all health protocol and isolate themselves completely at home in a separate room with a separate washroom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/pulse-oximeter-for-home-quarantined-covid-19-patients-in-delhi-cm-kejriwal/story-uX14tu4a5Elgv7xIMAx9lO.html

The PWD department has spent approximately Rs 13 lakh on clearing snow from the road,” said national highways’ chief engineer Archarna Parmar Thakur. The national highway had remained snowbound till May-end as the BRO had shifted the snow clearance machinery to other roads abandoning the work halfway.160KM STRETCH OPENED TO TRAFFICIn the wake of escalated tensions between Chinese and Indian troops in Ladakh over the boundary dispute in Galwan valley, the Himachal Pradesh Public Works department swung into action to clear the road that was buried under 15 to 20 feet of snow. The 160-kilometre road stretch was finally opened to vehicular traffic on June 15. The roads is used by the defense to ensure movement of its vehicles to forward areas.The public works department has drawn an estimate of Rs 4 crore for the construction and maintenance of the highway.The PWD drew up the estimates on the basis of a survey conducted by SATRA Infrastructure Management Services.A detailed project report has already been submitted to the government for upgrading the highway to 210km.“Tenders to upgrade the highway will be floated shortly,” she said.The ministry of surface transport has also approved the proposed alignment the road that was submitted to the PWD through the BRO.TENDER AWARDED FOR PATCH WORKThe national highway authority has also assigned patch work on the highway stretch connecting Shimla –Kalka-Wangtoo and the stretch connecting Shalaghat to the road junction link near Panthaghatti in Shimla . The work has been awarded to MVD Cementation and Construction Private Limited.Pending work on NH-22 will be completed by July- end.

While majority of the sex workers are still not ready to start their work, a handful of them have resumed business as they are facing financial crunch due to the long lockdown,” said Sevekari.The NGO has started imparting training through audio and video clips to the sex workers on what precautions they need to take during customer visits.“Since there will be physical contact with customers, we have chalked out SOPs and guidelines. While condoms are mandatory, now masks and gloves are also a must during sexual activity. They have been asked to use hand sanitisers and disinfectants,” Sevekari said.Some of the sex workers have bought thermal scanners and foot-operated sanitiser dispensers and placed them outside their premises, she said.“It has been advised to ask the customer to take a shower before the activity and not to entertain any customer having cough or fever,” she added.The NGO is also encouraging them to explore the ‘phone sex’ option and asking those who are already into virtual sex business to teach others, Sevekari said.“Phone sex is quite normal in high-end call girls, but it is a new thing for sex workers here. There are some sex workers who are already using the medium and they are sharing their experiences with others,” she said.The objective is to allow them to earn their livelihood without being exposed to any physical contact with customers, thus keeping the risk of Covid-19 at bay, she said.Inspector Jagannath Kalaskar from Faraskhana police station, which has jurisdiction over the Budhwar Peth red light area, said they had a meeting with NGOs working in the area and asked them to ensure all precautions are taken.“Sex workers have been told not to stand or sit outside their rooms, and those are ill or infected with HIV have been asked to stay away,” Kalaskar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/unlock-1-sex-workers-in-pune-seek-to-resume-work-with-caution-sops/story-sh5QbcpVHE3105hQwpOnuM.html

22-06-2020||Lucknow||UP Police face a tough task to convince people over kanwar yatra||A day after the Uttar Pradesh government suspended the annual Kanwar Yatra in the wake of prevailing Covid-19 pandemic, officials in Meerut and Saharanpur regions — the two main pilgrimage centres of the yatra — said they have a tough task ahead to convey the decision of suspension of the yatra to devotees and convince them. “Spreading the message and convincing devotees would be a big challenge in the coming days,” said additional director general ( ADG) of police, Meerut zone, Rajeev Sabharwal.The state government, in consultation with the Haryana and Uttarakhand governments, on Saturday decided to suspend the annual pilgrimage of Lord Shiva devotees that takes place in the Hindu holy month of Shravan. The yatra was to start from July 5-6 and conclude on July 19. Jagmohan Shakal, who has been organising a camp for providing food and lodging to ‘Kanwarias’ for over two decades now, supported the decision and said that camp organisers were worried about the safety of devotees. Every year, three to four hundred thousand devotees come to the Meerut’s Kali Paltan temple during the yatra every year. Temple’s management committee’s secretary Satish Kumar Singhal expressed his dismay over the suspension of the yatra. On the other hand, the temple’s chief priest Sridhar Tripathi supported the government’s decision and said, “Life is above all and devotees should understand it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-police-face-a-tough-task-to-convince-people-over-kanwar-yatra/story-1WYNoMsMZBUncksmTmYxiI.html

22-06-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: X-raying an artist||How to describe her? Painter? Production designer? Photographer? Producer or film maker?Oh well, Aradhana Seth is an artist. And like most members of this restless species, she is able to rustle out pieces of creativity even under the most trying circumstances. Despite being home-bound due to the coronavirus pandemic, the lady is still occupied in her primary pursuits. Recently, she sorted out the thousands of photographs she had accumulated over the previous years. And currently she is painting with... attention please, here’s some corona-era story! You’ll agree that the usual paint colours are not exactly the ‘essential commodities’ of these troubled days that one can get from the neighbourhood grocer. So, Ms Seth is sourcing her colouring ingredients from fruit, vegetables and flowers. For instance, she gets her red from beetroot, carrot, pomegranate and red wine; yellow from haldi and tesu ke phool; and green from papaya leaf and palak ke patte.“See, I made my Fish on Zoom with beetroot, red cabbage, neem juice and sesame seeds,” she says, showing a panel of nine painted fish, each to its small box—the artwork is looking exactly like the laptop screen Zoom meetings of our new-normal interactions. Ms Seth is chatting on WhatsApp video from the isolation of her home (which has partially been turned into a studio!) in Noida where she shares the “dinner arrangements” daily with father, Prem Nath, and brother Vikram. “With a great amount of help as well as oil” from their cook, Basanti.Ms Seth has a house in Goa, too. “Dreaming of the sea while landlocked in Delhi,” she soon plans to fly to her other home.She gamely agreed to become a part of our Proust Questionnaire series in which we nudge folks from diverse backgrounds to make “Parisian parlour confessions”, all to explore the lives, thoughts, values and experiences of Delhi’s citizens.Your favourite virtue or the principal aspect of your personalityIntuition.

22-06-2020||City||Parents on Twitter say students till Class 2 have #righttolearn||Parents from across the state took to Twitter and posted tweets using #righttolearn to urge the Maharashtra government to allow regulated online learning for students up to Class 2. According to the standard operating procedures (SOPs) released by the state, online learning is banned up to Class 2.“As a parent, as a teacher, I want my children to have the right to learn. Let the children open the wings of their knowledge and let this pandemic not stop them from learning. I support online classes,” read a tweet by one of the parents in Mumbai. Parents of students from Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh also joined the Twitter storm to protest against the decision to ban online classes up to Class 5 by their respective state governments. Several parent bodies from across these states participated in the campaign and tweeted on Sunday afternoon.On June 17, the Members of the International Schools Association (MISA) wrote to state education minister Varsha Gaikwad, recommending two 30-minute sessions for pre-school students everyday, with adequate breaks in between. “The joy and benefits of online education should not be taken away from students,” the association stated in the letter.“In families where both parents work, children need some learning stimulus and social interaction with their peers for some time, for their psychological and physical well-being. For this, we are hoping that a few minutes of interaction are allowed by the state,” said Pradnya Shinde, a parent from Malad.Some parents, however, were of the opinion that attending online classes will be extremely stressful for students.“Beyond the dangers of screen time for students, online classes will also cause stress for parents, as children as young as three and four years can’t sit alone for classes and need constant hand holding. For a couple of months, schools can trust parents with their children instead of bombarding them with instruction-based learning,” said a parent from Dadar.Officials from the education department in the past said that the decision to not hold online classes for students until Class 2 was taken after several complaints from parents about the ill effects of screen time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/parents-on-twitter-say-students-till-class-2-have-righttolearn/story-rJ77oc0nvbpj9bvv5InyQJ.html
22-06-2020||Mumbai||I’ve braved death, and came out more determined to cure people and help them live, says Mumbai pulmonologist||It was almost after two-and-a-half months of tending to Covid-19 patients at Lilavati Hospital that I first felt the symptoms. On June 11, I started getting back and body aches with no fever, cough and breathlessness.After taking doses of Ivermectin and Doxycycline, the weakness increased, and one night I felt I was dying. It was on June 13 that I was rushed by the Lilavati administration to the hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU) in emergency. I did not know what was happening and my situation kept deteriorating. I never thought I would make it.A day later, I saw my wife being wheeled into the ICU, to the bed next to mine.I thought of my son, and asked myself, “What will I answer to him if anything happens to his mother. And to me?” This single thought gave me the strength to fight. I wanted to be out of this space – the ICU – which had become a mess.What was once a nice clean pleasant place, was struggling with overburdened staff – nurses who are spending countless hours in PPE [personal protective equipment] kits without water, tea, coffee and worse, without visiting the toilet. There are only two-three people to clean and give bedpans for 48 beds. Hats off to them for doing this day in and day out, going beyond their brief with a risk that they might be infected, and without complaints. ICU patients are being taken in irrespective of whether they are rich or poor or from any religion – everyone is equal and provided necessary help and medication.After doses of Iv Rocezulimab and Iv Remdesivir over the next 10 days, I have finally made it home. Unfortunately, my doctor colleague who attended to me is now occupying my bed.This experience led me to think about all the noise outside and react.Firstly, the government has to stop going behind private institutions that are bleeding, and in fact help by providing necessary medication, which is not available. Do they want these institutions to shut down?Patients want to file cases for being administered certain medicines, despite saving them, following ICMR’s [Indian Council for Medical Research] diktats. How fair is that? Especially when there is no vaccine or fixed line of treatment that can be applicable to all patients?I also feel that managements of hospitals have to consider incentivising frontline Covid-19 health workers, such as ward boys and nurses, considering the amazing work they do.There is too much stigma that people are attaching with Covid – housing societies showing high-handedness, exploiting their positions of power, not allowing house helps, vendors and other essential workers to visit people who genuinely need help. They are preventing people from leading a normal life. I appeal to authorities, the police and ministers to take cognisance of such people.Today as I still lay weak in my bed at home, I am continuously getting calls for prescribing treatment and to seek help at the hospital. I feel thankful for the prayers and blessings of my people, and the hospital management, that my wife and I are alive.I am hoping to get better soon, and back on my feet to be at the service of the people, to help them live. But I hope we can change a few things to help us get through this difficult phase. I have braved death, and came out more determined to do what I have left behind- cure people, and help them live.(Dr Jalil Parkar, pulmonologist, department of chest medicine at Lilavati Hospital and Research Centre)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/i-ve-braved-death-and-came-out-more-determined-to-cure-people-and-help-them-live-says-mumbai-pulmonologist/story-flo1437dZQRm0zmrksxtJN.html
22-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab govt start free hemophilia treatment||In a relief to hemophilia patients, the Punjab government on Sunday decided to start treatment by anti-hemophilia factors in 18 integrated care centres across the state.Health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said that to provide quality treatment to needy hemophilia patients, the government has established 18 care centres in state. Besides, three centres in government medical colleges, 15 centres have been set up in district hospitals. Soon, four more centres would be opened in other districts of state, he added. At these centres, anti-hemophilia factors 8, 9, 7a & FEIBA are to be provided to patients free of cost so that emergency treatment services are provided to all patients. The minister said that earlier, patients were helpless and had to spend Rs. 18 to 80 lakh annually for the treatment. Now, all expenses are to be borne by the state government. For this purpose, registration of patients is going on. Sidhu said the training has been provided to the staff by specialist doctors from Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, and other experts through webinars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-govt-start-free-hemophilia-treatment/story-FKtFdf2dzeCWgs4LrbFkgM.html
22-06-2020||Mumbai||Amid lockdown, 75 rescued kids in Mumbai wait to be reunited with families||took a mammoth effort from the government machinery to help migrant workers from Maharashtra to get back home. But, at the Children’s Home at Dongri unfolds another story of minor children whose loneliness, anxiety and cries, to be reunited with their families, remain confined to the four walls of the children’s home.There are 75 children, rescued from child labour and trafficking, waiting to be reunited with their families. Some of these children had also been missing or had run away from their homes. “Usually once the children are rescued, their parents come and take custody. But the lockdown made it difficult for these poor families to obtain an e-pass for Mumbai. Only one family has managed to take custody of their child in the past three months,” said Rahul Kanthikar, superintendent, Dongri Children Home.A man from Mumbai who frequently travelled to Uttar Pradesh had offered job to the teenage sons of a villager from Ballia district, Uttar Pradesh. He promised his sons aged 17 and 15 years that the job would fetch them ₹6,000 a month. The brothers, however, were made to work in a bangle manufacturing unit at Malad. Within a few days, the 15-year-old could not cope up with 14-hour shift and he returned home. But the 17-year-old was forced to continue with his job at the unit.In February this year, a team of police officials raided the bangle unit and rescued the 17-year-old, along with other children, and sent him to the Children’s Home in Dongri. The rescue was communicated to his family and they expected their son to come back home.In another case, a 13-year-old boy was kidnapped from Mysore, Karnataka, and brought to Mumbai by a man who had sedated his drink. The man along with his accomplices had kept the child in a small room from where he managed to escape. He, then, went to a police station and narrated his ordeal. Counsellors at the Children’s Home say that the child is bright and is worried about his studies. All these children, from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Punjab, West Bengal, are staring at an uncertain future now.Uncertainty due to Covid-19 outbreakThe other arrangement made by the concerned authorities was to send these rescued kids to children’s home of their respective state. Then, the Children’s Welfare Committee of that state would help these children reunite with their parents. But there was no approval from the respective states due to the spread of the Covid-19, said Kanthikar.To make matter worse, a nurse and two kids at the Children’s Home tested positive for the virus. “Many kids were anxious, and faced sleep-related issues, loss of appetite, mood-swings, drop-in daily activities etc,” said Kadambari Dube, a counsellor at Dongri Children’s home. “The kids are anxious about the uncertainty this pandemic has brought. They are anxious about their academic year, exam results, condition of their parents, etc. It is very difficult to make the kids understand what exactly Covid-19 is and why the lockdown was necessary,” Dube said.Signs of anxiety and depression seen among childrenWhile officials at the children’s home help the rescued children by enabling them to talk to their families over the phone, but counsellors say that longer stay of a child at the children’s home harms the child’s psyche. “We have observed signs of anxiety and depression among the children, and ask us about their families, and are adamant that they be reunited with their parents in the shortest possible time,” said Sachi Maniar, director of Ashiyana Foundation, that works with Dongri Children’s Home.‘Home states are reluctant to accept rescued children’Urmila Jadhav, one of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) members, Mumbai, said, other states are not willing to accept children back easily. “It is a known fact that the CWCs of other states are reluctant to accept these rescued children and now they are giving an excuse of the spread of a contagious disease. We are ready to send the kids after conducting their Covid tests, but they are delaying the paperwork.”Hrishikesh Yashod, commissioner of Women and Child Development, Maharashtra state, said, “It’s a stressful situation for everyone. Children are even more vulnerable, and they need care and protection. There is no denial to the fact that kids in Children Care Institutions [or children homes] are anxious, panicked and are in stress because of the lockdown. Usually other states approve, but because of the lockdown the procedure is affected.”“One cannot deny the reluctant approach of administration of other states. Unavailability of a police escort party is also an issue. But the department is taking all possible measures to reunite the kids,” Yashod added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/amid-lockdown-75-rescued-kids-in-mumbai-wait-to-be-reunited-with-families/story-KRhfiKgvHQ9ArHTIPW6cfI.html

22-06-2020||Chandigarh||8,000 hectares of Punjab’s forest land in illegal occupation, govt drags feet||Nearly 8,000 hectares of Punjab’s forest land is in the possession of illegal occupants with the state government dragging its feet on framing a policy on its demarcation and afforestation, the 2019-20 audit report of the accountant general (AG) has pointed out. These encroachments are causing huge revenue losses to the state exchequer, says the report which was sent to the additional chief secretary (forest and wildlife) for clarification. Despite the Punjab and Haryana High Court’s 2018 decision to transfer the land to the forest department, 8,012 hectares still remains occupied by the encroachers, the report adds. The revenue department had received ₹116.77 crore for the purchase of non-forest land for compensatory plantation from the financial year 2013-14 to 2018-19, but it spent only ₹10.84 crore till 2013-14 for procurement of land for afforestation, it says. The chief conservator of forests’ records showed that 5 out of 16 divisions did not have continuous working plans between 2016-17 and 2018-19. The annual reports of the Punjab State Financial Development Corporation (PSFDC) for 2013-14 to 2018-19, revealed that the forest department raised loans worth crores of rupees without the approval of the state assembly for office use, which is a contravention of the constitutional provisions.The report adds that 9,814 hectare of forest land under the jurisdiction of Mohali, Ferozepur and Hoshiarpur wildlife divisions had not been demarcated and the department had not completed legal procedure to mark the boundaries of protected areas. This had led to problems like encroachments, road accidents, man-animal conflict and vulnerability to cattle borne diseases.UNAUTHORISED CONTROL OVER WILDLIFE SANCTUARYThe report says after the declaration of the wildlife sanctuary in Abohar, the local people started to convert their land (tibbas) into agricultural fields that led to degradation of habitats of endangered species and black bucks were killed by stray dogs. The people did so as the area in the sanctuary was private in nature.The failure to transfer the control of the sanctuary to the wildlife wing defeated the very purpose of creating protected areas, it adds.Additional chief secretary (forest and wildlife) Ravneet Kaur did not respond to calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/8-000-hectares-of-punjab-s-forest-land-in-illegal-occupation-govt-drags-feet/story-DFLTigy5uhLozk9LDVff1O.html
22-06-2020||Chandigarh||Pak Sikhs condemn former minister’s remark against Maharaja Ranjit Singh||The Sikh community in Pakistan has strongly objected to the derogatory remark made by Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) leader and country’s former railway minister Khawaja Saad Rafique against Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the founder of the Sikh Empire, and demanded an apology from him. Rafique, who is facing trial in corruption cases in Pakistan’s courts, in a tweet termed Ranjit Singh as an “authoritative looter”, held him responsible for the desecration of mosques during his regime and the domination of the Dogras in the Kashmir valley. “The science minister should apologise to the nation for calling Ranjit Singh’s era the golden age and terming him the greatest hero of Punjab,” reads the tweet written in Urdu.The Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) has lodged protest against the statement. “The words used by the former railway minister are highly objectionable. The Sikh community in Pakistan and the gurdwara management committee strongly condemn these words,” said PSGPC president Satwant Singh.He said, “It is sad that Rafique has not read history of Sikhs who have always favoured human values. As far as Maharaja Ranjit Singh is concerned, we don’t have any single instance from his 42-year-long regime that he ever committed any atrocity against any person. The biggest evidence of this is that nobody was sentenced to death in his rule.” “Leaders of Sikh community had never been dacoits or robbers. He should apologise for this,” he added. Also, Gopal Singh Chawla, a Khalistan sympathiser, said in a video that Maharaja Ranjit Singh was their hero and words against him are not tolerable. “Had he (Rafique) been a good politician, he would not face so many cases. Maharaja Ranjit Singh never differentiated between people on the basis of religion,” he said.Besides, some liberal Muslims in Pakistan have condemned the remark. “He has no right to use these kinds of words,” said Shahid Shabir, an activist working for the preservation of Sikh heritage in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pak-sikhs-condemn-former-minister-s-remark-against-maharaja-ranjit-singh/story-3rLcK3ZSTI97tPi4fUlnxM.html

The student’s father, Shrinivas Pankala, 51, filed a complaint at Santacruz police station.With classes being conducted through video-conferencing due to the lockdown, Pankala’s son was looking to buy headphones and a webcam for attending online classes. On June 13, the student found an anonymous website while searching for high-resolution devices and contacted the number mentioned on the site to inquire if there was any discount on the devices. A police officer said, “The accused told him he is selling these products on special discounted rate. The teenager asked him to dispatch the products and agreed to settle the bill through online payment.”According to the police, the accused contacted the student after sometime and said he has dispatched the products. The accused also sent a QR code to the student which, he said, needs to be scanned for the payment. After the student scanned the code, ₹67,495 was deducted from his father’s account.The teenager then informed his father about this, after which they tried to contact the seller, but failed. His father then approached the police. The police on June 18 registered a first information report (FIR) against an unknown person under sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and section 66 (C)(D) of the Information Technology Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/student-from-mumbai-loses-67-000-after-ordering-headphones-for-online-classes/story-tuxpiE6s2iNGqMQutGjrzJ.html
22-06-2020||Chandigarh||Regulator raps PSPCL for failing to move 5.5 lakh meters off the premises||The Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) has given the Punjab State Power Corporation (PSPCL) a rap on its knuckles for failing to shift as many as 5.47 lakh electricity meters outside the premises of the consumers. The regulator has asked the corporation to file a compliance report by September 30.In its tariff order for the financial year 2020-21 announced on June 1, the power regulator noted that the meters on the consumers’ premises were prone to tampering and they are one of the contributing factors for distribution losses. In its tariff order issued last year, the commission had given the PSPCL the November 26 deadline to shift all the meters out to the pillar boxes or the poles outside the consumers’ premises. As per PSPCL figures, the state has nearly 92 lakh power connections of which 13.5 lakh are of agriculture tubewells and 70 lakh are domestic. The rest are in the industrial and commercial sectors. From January 1 to December 1, 2019, 1.25 lakh electro-mechanical meters were shifted out in the state under the integrated power development scheme, Deen Dayal Upadhayay Gramin Jyoti Yojana and restructured accelerated power development and reforms programme. In an undertaking given to the PSERC before finalisation of the annual tariff, the corporation had assured that work of shifting meters will be completed by March 2020, but details on this are awaited. The process of shifting of meters out of the consumers’ premises started in 2007 on pilot project basis and losses were brought down from up to 80% to 12 %.Bhupinder Singh, a retired deputy chief engineer of PSPCL, said he led the pilot project in 2007 and on its basis a loan of ₹2,500 was sanctioned by the rural electrification corporation to start shifting of meters across the state. “Until 2012, the programme was carried at a good pace but it lost steam in 2013-14,” he said.“We are shifting meters in a phased manner. There is resistance from the consumers to new meters in some areas. We hope to complete the process soon,” said PSPCL director (distribution) DIPS Grewal.4.36 LAKH METERS NEED REPLACEMENT As many as 4.36 lakh meters fitted with outdated electro-mechanical technology are also waiting to be replaced with electronic meters. The electro-mechanical meters are still in use in violation of the metering regulations of the central electricity authority and the state power regulator. “The utilities in other parts of the country are contemplating smart metering but the PSPCL is still continuing with obsolete technology of electro-mechanical meters,” said the power tariff of June 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/regulator-raps-pspcl-for-failing-to-move-5-5-lakh-meters-off-the-premises/story-dson0Cjyl35HTrTz4Rh8FK.html
22-06-2020||Delhi||Confusion persists on home isolation rules for Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms||A day after the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), headed by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, scrapped its order mandating five days of institutional quarantine even for those with mild Covid-19 symptoms, but said that every person who tests positive be taken to Covid Care Centres (CCC) for an assessment of their clinical conditions, some district administration officials in the city are calling the move impractical on the grounds that it would increase the risk of the infection. Meanwhile, with no new standard operating procedure (SOP) issued yet, there was confusion on how to deal with new cases on Sunday, and some other district officials said they continued with the previous protocol — sending health officials to the patient’s residence for a clinical diagnosisThe order on Saturday night, issued by principal health secretary Vikram Dev Dutt, said “all individuals who are positive will be referred to the COVID Care Centres for assessment of clinical conditions, the severity of illness and presence of comorbidities”.To be eligible for home isolation, a patient’s house needs to have a separate room with an attached bathroom, and space for isolation for a dedicated caregiver and other family members.As of Sunday evening, 12,106 Covid-19 patients in the city are under home isolation.But, senior officials in the government said that another problem had emerged because of a Friday order that coincided with the one in which five days’ institutional quarantine was made mandatory for all patients — the scrapping of the contract of the company that was handling the contact and management of all home quarantine patients.A senior government official said that on Saturday, when the LG withdrew the mandatory five-day institutional quarantine rule, he allowed Portea Medical to operate for the time being, until an alternative was given by the Delhi health department. The rule, however, has a catch, the official said. “The company has been allowed to operate, but it has not been allowed to take any new Covid patient since Friday’s order. So, they are tracking only the old 10,490 patients that were in home isolation until Friday. As a result, there is no one now to follow up on the new asymptomatic and mild patients in home isolation,” the officer added. An analysis of government data revealed that since Friday, 9,767 new Covid-19 cases have been added in the Capital. Of these, about 1,600 were admitted in hospitals, Covid Health Centres and Covid Care Centres.“The company used to make calls twice a day to every patient under home isolation. The patient’s temperature, signs of any symptoms and other factors were recorded. In case anyone reported of any symptoms, the information was sent to the district surveillance officers (DSOs) for shifting him/her to a Covid facility,” another government official said.At Monday’s DDMA meeting, the health department is likely to inform the LG that it is going to rope in medical students to make the phone calls. It is also being planned that the surveillance teams will be made responsible for tracking these patients, a government official said. “However, with districts already facing a major staff crunch, the chief minister’s office has raised concern as to who will follow up with every patient for 14 days,” the official said.In any case, the decision to send all patients to care centres for assessment has district officials worried at a time when the Capital is recording an average of 2,652 new Covid-19 new cases a day for the past week. “How will they travel to a care centre? We don’t have enough infrastructure to take all new cases, there are logistical issues. And we can’t allow them to go to a centre on their own, as it will increase the risk of transmission,” said a district magistrate.“While the ambulance fleet has been augmented and 500-odd more ambulances will be added to the existing fleet soon, it won’t be possible to take all patients to CCC for clinical assessment,” a Delhi government official said.A second district magistrate said: “The order doesn’t say all new cases have to be taken to CCC. Our teams are going to the homes of people who have tested positive and doing the assessment there.”But a senior Delhi government official said, “The order is clear and has to be implemented. There will be no separate SOPs, which will be issued.”Saturday’s order said: “All individuals who are positive will be referred to the COVID care centres for assessment of clinical conditions, severity of illness and presence of co-morbidities.”According to a Delhi government official familiar with the matter, the DMs in all 11 revenue districts will be in charge of the management of patients under home isolation in localities under their jurisdiction. The health department will submit a plan for the same to the DDMA by Monday afternoon, the official said.Meanwhile, several Covid-19 patients who were under home isolation were shifted to institutional quarantine following Delhi L-G’s order on Friday, which was then revoked on Saturday.A doctor with a district surveillance team said: “After Friday’s order, we had shifted a few people from home isolation. Now they will be shifted home only after a proper physical assessment of their house is done as per the new order.”Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital said, “Bringing them to centres for clinical assessment will only increase the risk of transmission.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/confusion-persists-on-home-isolation-rules/story-mnb8raoBYHEsAvzkx0sjNO.html
22-06-2020||Mumbai||6 sites in MMR are now wetlands||The Maharashtra forest department has approved and published an official document showing six ecologically sensitive areas in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) as wetlands.The Thane creek flamingo sanctuary (TCFS) management plan 2020-2030, sanctioned by the state’s chief wildlife warden (CWLW) on June 18, has officially designated six sites – Bhandup (11 ha) in Mumbai, Panje (124 ha), Belpada (30 ha), Bhendkhal (8 ha) in Uran, Training Ship Chanakya (13 ha), NRI Complex (19 ha) in Navi Mumbai – as wetlands.The areas have been listed as ‘satellite wetlands that need to be protected within a 50km radius of TCFS’, the document read. This is the first time the state has also officially declared its intent to protect each site as either conservation or community reserves. HT has a copy of the approved management plan, while the mangrove cell confirmed the development.Virendra Tiwari, the additional principal chief conservator of forest, state mangrove cell, said the identification of these six sites as wetlands was done based on a report by the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) - Coastal Wetlands and water birds of Navi Mumbai 2019.“The report has been made part of the official document (TCFS management plan), which was approved by the CWLW under provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. This is the first step. It is our endeavour to follow up with competent authorities (district administration and state bodies) to declare these sites as protected areas,” said Tiwari.The proposed action plan for these six sites include understanding the linkages between TCFS and its satellite wetlands in the radius of 50km, to work with research organisations to monitor the status of these wetlands, the mangrove cell to liaise with agencies concerned to formulate necessary policies for conserving identified wetlands, and finally to declare them as conservation or community reserves (protected areas). “Six satellite wetlands have been identified and flamingo movement will be monitored with the help of experts. Flamingos are itinerant species (travelling from place to place) adapted to respond to changes in local environment by moving, and depend on a network of suitable sites. Conservation of satellite wetlands around TCFS is also equally critical for the long-term survival of flamingos in the region,” the document read.Wetland sites such as TSC, NRI, and Panje had witnessed large flocks of flamingos from March to May. BNHS estimated that there were over 1.5 lakh flamingos visiting MMR wetlands this migratory season. “Protecting these wetlands will help us achieve our sustainable development goals and commitments to the global community on Central Asian Flyway that the Prime Minister had announced during the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS COP 13) in Gandhinagar in February,” said Deepak Apte, director, BNHS. “They are vital migratory bird habitats and their protection is crucial from the air safety point of view for the Navi Mumbai International Airport.”Prior to the latest development, HT had reported on April 29 about a letter issued by the mangrove cell to the Raigad and Thane district administrations, City Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco), and Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) for a no-objection certificate and comments on declaring these six zones a Conservation Reserves. While both district administrations are yet to respond, JNPT had said the sites under their jurisdiction, Belpada and Bhendkhal, were not wetlands, but commercial and agricultural lands. Cidco, that had plans to construct an 18-hole golf course over NRI and TSC, has not officially responded to the mangrove cell, but told HT that they had ‘no clarity’ on the fate of the golf courses at the moment.“With large-scale destruction reported from all these sites already, this decision by the forest department will help protect the last surviving major wetlands in MMR, safeguard city areas from flooding and defend losses to local livelihood,” said environmentalist Stalin D.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/6-sites-in-mmr-are-now-wetlands/story-7bjQTy3CoLdn8dXZmfwqUI.html

22-06-2020||Mumbai||Rare marine life sighted from Mahalaxmi shoreline||South Mumbai residents and a marine biologist have requested the state to protect areas around the Mahalaxmi Bay, as Coastal Road reclamation work has begun in the area.A report on the intertidal biodiversity along the Mahalaxmi shoreline in south Mumbai by independent marine biologist Gaurav Patil has identified two species of hard corals (Paracyathus and Cladangia exusta). Corals are protected under schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, the same protection status as that of a tiger or an elephant. Rare species such sea urchins, honeycomb moray eel, 12 species of sea slugs, six species of crustaceans along with gastropods and echinoderms were all documented across Mahalaxmi Bay between September 2019 and March 2020.“The environment impact assessment report only had brief details of marine biodiversity along the south Mumbai coastline and did not document specific areas that have rare and protected species. We need to have an overall perspective of what is at stake before commencing development activities,” said Patil.Meanwhile, residents from the Maha Goolestan Co-op Housing Society on Bhulabhai Desai Road shared a letter they wrote to environment minister Aaditya Thackeray last week. “We have requested the state to avoid reclaiming the Mahalaxmi Bay area which is an economically important and sensitive fishing zone, home to corals, gastropods, bivalve species, and a roosting area for migratory birds. However, some of these zones have already been reclaimed over the weekend,” a residents said.“Work on the coastal road may have gone too far to stop the project itself, but even now, if done sensitively, we can save essential portions of our scenic coastline and along with it the livelihood of fishers.”The 9.9-km current phase of the ₹12,969-crore project, will include an eight-lane highway, which will connect Marine Drive to the southern end of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link. Reclamation activity has been undertaken from Nariman Point to Worli. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said they would ensure the biodiversity in the area is protected. “We are in constant consultation with the National Institute of Oceanography and ecologists appointed by our contractor who is guiding us to avoid environmentally sensitive zones during reclamation,” said Vijay Nighot, chief engineer, BMC’s coastal road project||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rare-marine-life-sighted-from-mahalaxmi-shoreline-as-coastal-road-reclamation-inches-closer/story-s6RnlSNVKAEUcIHEYAy3zN.html

22-06-2020||Mumbai||Buyer challenges MahaRERA circular allowing 6-month extension to developers||A flat buyer has filed a petition in the Bombay high court (HC), challenging the May 18 order of the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulation Authority (MahaRERA), in which it had extended the validity of all registered projects by six months, whose completion, revised completion or extended completion dates expired on or after March 15. The petitioner has claimed that MahaRERA’s decision favoured certain defaulting promoters at the cost of thousands of flat purchasers. The court will hear the petition on Tuesday.The petitioner, Sagar Sarjerao Nikam, had purchased a flat on January 12, 2017, for which he had paid around 95 % of the total amount to the promoter. In his petition, filed through advocates Manish and Nilesh Gala, Nikam has stated that the promoter had promised to deliver the possession by December 2017, but failed to do so as an occupancy certificate (OC) for the flat was rejected owing to a default. The petitioner and his family have been staying on leave-and-license basis, paying rent, owing to which he has been suffering financial difficulties.Nikam’s petition has further stated that on April 2 this year, MahaRERA had extended the registration validity of projects by three months. The authority further extended the validity by three more months on May 18 by invoking the ‘force majeure’ (unprecedented event) clause, stating that the Covid-19 outbreak is a calamity which is adversely affecting the regular development of real estate projects.The petition further added that MahaRERA’s order has also exempted errant developers from paying compensation in case of failure to deliver the property under the law, even for those cases that had lapsed before March 15. The plea said that the decision was taken arbitrarily and would lead to hardships and losses to allottees, who have invested in real estate projects and have been waiting for years together to get possession.Nikam has claimed that the decision illegally granted extensions and relaxations to errant promoters, depriving purchasers of their statutory rights of being heard. In view of this, the plea has sought direction from the court to declare MahaRERA’s decision to invoke force majeure and to treat it as a ‘moratorium period’ to calculate the interest under RERA law, as illegal and be quashed. The plea has also submitted that the decision was completely arbitrary and violative of the mandate of the RERA law.As the bench led by chief justice Dipankar Datta could not hear the case owing to paucity of time on Friday, the petition will now be heard on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/buyer-challenges-maharera-circular-allowing-6-month-extension-to-developers/story-DDWdAIpRNzVP9u5Xf1cClI.html
22-06-2020||Mumbai||Aarey, a part of SGNP, state body admits before SC; calls it a ‘forest’ in its affidavit||The chief executive officer (CEO) of the Aarey administration and representing the dairy development department in a counter-affidavit filed in the Supreme Court (SC) said the green lung in Goregaon is part of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP). This is the first time any state body has put on record that Aarey is contiguous to the national park. The submission clarifies that while Aarey is not a notified forest, necessary actions against encroachments and tree felling were taken up in ‘forest areas’. Aarey, one of the last remaining green lungs in the city, has been a bone of contention for the last four years, ever since a proposal to build a car-shed for the Metro 3 line (Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ). Environmentalists have been fighting the matter at the National Green Tribunal, Bombay HC, and now SC calling the area a ‘forest’ home to a rich biodiversity, which will allegedly be destroyed due to development projects. There are 27 tribal hamlets within Aarey Colony with nine hamlets across Force One, Film City, Veterinary College and SRPF areas. A qualitative study using maps showed how Aarey lost its green cover periodically since the late 1940s. The study by Kamla Raheja Vidyanidhi Institute of Architecture and Environmental Studies (KRVIA), Mumbai, reported only 800 of 1,300 ha of Aarey, originally allocated as ‘No Development Zone’ will remain as a ‘Green Zone’ leading to a loss of approximately 40% original area due to ongoing and proposed construction activities. Public and private projects are likely to sever the contiguity with SGNP affecting wildlife movement, disrupting hydrological processes and the natural drainage pattern of the green lung, the report said.The counter-affidavit was filed on May 5 by Aarey CEO Nathu Rathod in response to an interim application filed by environment group Vanashakti during the last week of April (in other Aarey-related petitions before the SC) against various state bodies including the forest department and Aarey administration. Vanashakti alleged illegal tree felling, forest fires, and rising encroachments at Aarey despite there being a lockdown and sought the protection of the area and action against wrongdoers. The counter-affidavit was received and made public by co-petitioner Zoru Bhathena on Sunday.Calling for the dismissal of the application Rathod’s affidavit read, “Aarey Colony is a part of SGNP. The area of SGNP (including Aarey Colony) has been notified as an eco-sensitive zone under the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The forest department has administrative control over the area of SGNP whereas Aarey administration and dairy development department has administrative control over Aarey, and the forest department cannot take any legal action in respect to illegal activities in Aarey Colony.”Rathod confirming his submission said, “Aarey is an extension of SGNP. Though the area is not a declared forest, these forest patches home to several animals and birds are being protected by us. Any cases of tree felling, forest fires and encroachments are being tackled by us,” said Rathod. “Encroachers and tribal residents have tried to take advantage of the lockdown and encroach upon forest areas.”In his affidavit, Rathod identified cases of tree felling and illegal encroachment reported from units 5, 13, and 16. “In each case, our security staff took stock of the issue and filed a detailed complaint before the local police. So far three first-information-reports (FIRs) have been filed but nobody has been arrested. We have identified a few more violators, and informed the police,” said Rathod adding, “The forest fires were reported on April 17 and 20 from areas under the control of the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF), where we do not have access.”On June 16, the SC bench comprising Justice Arun Mishra and Justice Krishna Murari while hearing Vanashakti’s application called for a report from the state forest department on alleged illegal activities and action taken.The forest department said they would be filing their response soon as the matter will be heard in six weeks from the date of the order (June 16).Petitioners and environmentalists welcomed Rathod’s submissions. ““If one state body which is the land owner can honestly disclose that Aarey is a part of SGNP and it is a forest, then it is the state’s responsibility to notify and protect the green lung. This will end this six-year-long battle,” said Rohit Joshi, environmentalist.“This is the first time the state has submitted an honest response to the SC on factual details on Aarey. The submissions further say that the administration is helpless as the area has not been declared a forest, and they cannot take help from the forest department,” said Bhathena.Of the 1,287 hectares (ha) of Aarey, 165 ha was excluded from SGNP’s eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) by the Union environment ministry in its December 2016 notification to allow construction, including the Metro-3 car-shed. On June 16, a separate SC bench of justices Arun Mishra and S Abdul Nazeer dismissed a plea by Vanashakti challenging this exclusion stating, ‘Mumbai was already a congested city’. Of the 165 ha, projects across 161.6 ha have already been slotted (see box). “If not the Metro car depot, the latest affidavit is proof enough to save remaining portions of Aarey,” said Bhathena.A qualitative study using maps showed how Aarey lost its green cover periodically since the late 1940s. The study by Kamla Raheja Vidyanidhi Institute of Architecture and Environmental Studies (KRVIA), Mumbai, reported only 800 of 1,300 ha of Aarey, originally allocated as ‘No Development Zone’ will remain as a ‘Green Zone’ leading to a loss of approximately 40% original area due to ongoing and proposed construction activities. Public and private projects are likely to sever the contiguity with SGNP affecting wildlife movement, disrupting hydrological processes and the natural drainage pattern of the green lung, the report said.What’s at stake?3,166 acres (1,287 hectares) – Total area of Aarey Milk Colony407 acres (165 hectares) – excluded from eco-sensitive zone notification (issued on December 5, 2016) of Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) from Aarey, aimed at allowing construction activities, including the Metro projects and allied activitiesProjects at Aarey cover 393.67 acres (161.6 hectares) of land1.5 acres (33 hectares) – Taken up by Metro 3 car-depot construction led to the alleged felling of 2,141 trees according to the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd28.17 acres (11.4 hectare) – Total buildable area for the Metro Bhawan, according to the state government, including 5 acres (2.03 hectares) area on which Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA) will build the 32-storey Metro Bhawan, operation control centre, permanent re-servicing station, temporary labour camp, steel machinery yard, and metro related technical offices190 acres (76.8 hectares) – Zoological park of ‘international standards’ being built based on an agreement between the Maharashtra government and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.

22-06-2020||Mumbai||Nagpur bizman booked for exploiting, harassing 45-year-old woman||Sahar police have registered a first information report (FIR) against a 35-year-old Nagpur-based businessman for allegedly sexually assaulting a 45-year-old woman from Andheri. The case was registered last week after police received a written application from the woman stating that the accused had been sexually exploiting her for the past two years with false promises of marriage.The woman told police that she became friends with the accused via social media in 2017, after which they used to meet at hotels in Andheri. The accused sexually assaulted her and borrowed money from her on various pretexts. This year, when the woman stopped giving him money, he threatened to leak her photos and videos on social media.According to the complainant, in 2018, the constant sexual exploitation had pushed her to attempt suicide, but she survived. At the time, out of fear of social ostracism, she did not file any complaint. The woman’s advocate Ali Kaashif Khan said, “The accused was not ready to return the money he had borrowed and was blackmailing her time and again, after which she decided to file the complaint.”A police officer said the accused has been booked under sections 376 (rape), 420 (cheating) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). No arrest has been made yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nagpur-bizman-booked-for-exploiting-harassing-45-year-old-woman/story-1cLZINJCn2LJvS3Ebehn9N.html
22-06-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana plans its own anti-corruption watchdog||The Haryana government is actively mulling a proposal to set up a powerful and autonomous anti-corruption watchdog on the lines of central vigilance commission (CVC).“A brainchild of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, the state vigilance commission (SVC) will greatly help in ensuring clean and transparent administration. The idea is to send a loud and clear message to the corrupt elements,” said two top government functionaries, who are privy to the development. As vigilance bureaus/organisations are directly under the control of state governments, often there are allegations of these departments being used to settle political scores and checkmate opponents. An overarching autonomous vigilance institution free from the control of the state government and political influence will create an effective deterrence against corruption, said one of the functionaries.The SVC will also bolster the image of the CM whose slew of measures, including online transfer policy, have already brought a lot of transparency in the government functioning.Notably, clean governance has been Khattar’s poll plank in the assembly and Lok Sabha elections. “The CM wants to have SVC in place at the earliest, but not before building a consensus and seeking support of the Opposition,” a state BJP leader said, adding that discreet discussions are on with some key political leaders. Some trusted bureaucrats in the chief minister’s office are also in the loop.“The SVC will have eminent members from diverse fields, including judiciary, to ensure vital checks and balances,” said the second official.LEGAL FOOTINGLegal experts say a proper legislation needs to be enacted to set up the SVC. “It should not be based on the executive order and must be identical to the CVC,” they added.“How the SVC panel is selected will indicate the intentions of the government. While appointing the SVC panel, the government must adopt the same methodology, standards and procedures as followed by the Centre,” say legal experts, adding that there was no scope of diluting the appointment process.PULLS & PRESSURESA similar plan mooted by the neighbouring Punjab government some years ago came a cropper due to the pressure mounted by the IPS lobby that was opposed to the SVC. The government functionaries cited above admitted the possible backlash from the “IPS brigade” in the state too. Box: State vigilance commissionKhattar wants to put in place an overarching autonomous vigilance institution free from political influence to ensuring clean and transparent administrationThe SVC will have eminent members from diverse fields, including judiciary, to ensure proper checks and balancesImmediate challenge before the CM will be to bring on board home minister Anil Vij and neutralise the opposition from police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-plans-its-own-anti-corruption-watchdog/story-J2d0rzR67Ir0fh0mi7EU2K.html
22-06-2020||Delhi||Satyendar Jain’s health improves, may be shifted out of ICU soon||Delhi minister Satyendar Jain’s condition has been improving, and he is likely to be moved from the intensive care unit (ICU) to a ward by Monday, hospital officials said on Sunday.Jain is being treated for Covid-19 at Max Healthcare Hospital in Saket, and is being monitored by a team of critical care specialists. He was administered convalescent plasma therapy on Friday, after his health deteriorated.“His condition is stable, and he is currently under observation in the ICU. His condition has continued to improve, and there is a high possibility he will be shifted to a ward by Monday,” said an official from the hospital who asked to stay anonymous.He has no fever at the moment, and his oxygen levels have also significantly improved, the official said.Convalescent plasma therapy is an experimental medical procedure, where critical Covid-19 patients are treated using plasma collected from those who have recovered from the viral infection. Max Healthcare has the Central drugs controller’s approval to treat people using plasma therapy under clinical study mode as an experimental therapy.The minister had tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. He was admitted to the Delhi government-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital in Tahirpur on Monday night after he ran a high fever and was found to have low oxygen saturation levels.He had tested negative for Covid-19 on Tuesday. But another test the next day confirmed that he had contracted the infectious disease.His condition was stable and he was put on oxygen support at the government-run hospital intermittently.However, the minister, who is known to have no co-morbidities, had later developed pneumonia (lung infection), a known Covid-19 complication, and also complained of breathlessness and giddiness on Friday morning.On Friday, he was shifted to Max Hospital , where he was put on oxygen support at the ICU. Later in the day, a CT scan revealed that the pneumonic patch in his lungs had expanded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/satyendar-jain-s-health-improves-may-be-shifted-out-of-icu-soon/story-zVEvwJzEgiAWZI9K25KUNI.html

As the shopkeeper refused to give him fertiliser despite having stock, Bhuse ordered action against him. He also sent the local quality control officer on compulsory leave with immediate effect.Following complaints from farmers that they were not getting fertiliser despite shopkeepers having stock, Bhuse went to Navbharat Fertilizer, a shop in Aurangabad, to verify the plaints. When the minister, posing as a farmer, asked for ten bags of urea the shopkeeper denied having stock despite the notice at the shop which mentioned urea was available there. Bhuse then asked for the stock register but the shopkeeper said he left it at home.The minister then called the district superintendent agriculture officer and ordered a panchnama, following which the officer found 1,387 bags of urea from the shop. Bhuse also said that quality control officers need to work efficiently so that farmers don’t face such difficulties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/agriculture-minister-poses-as-a-farmer-raids-fertiliser-shop/story-7fYcBVN838FiUF19ytDAoL.html
22-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt ramps up Covid Health Centre beds capacity to around 17 times||With the city reporting an average of 2,652 cases every day over the past one week, the Delhi government is working to augment bed capacity in its Covid health centres (CHCs) in order to ensure that maximum hospital beds can be kept free for critical patients. In order to achieve the task, a rearrangement of beds from Covid care centres or CCCs was being done and, according to officials, the government has reduced capacity of its 10 Covid care centres (CCC) by more than 93% to enhance the bed capacity in its CHCs to around 17 times.While CHCs cater to patients with symptoms ranging between moderate and severe, the CCCs are supposed to isolate patients with mild symptoms. The CHCs are required to have beds with oxygen facility, dedicated team of doctors, nurses and paramedics working in shifts, tie-up with a nearby Covid-19 hospital for assistance and at least one dedicated ambulance with oxygen support, among other requirements drafted by the Union health ministry, senior government officials said.With Covid-19 patients who have mild or no symptoms no longer needing mandatory institutional quarantine after the revision of an order to this effect by the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) on Saturday, the government has embarked on its plan to rearrange beds from CCCs to CHCs. The rearrangement of beds had stopped soon after the L-G’s order on Friday but was restarted on Saturday soon after a revised order was issued. Senior government officials said bed capacity at CCCs will also be enhanced in the days to come as the government acquires more banquet halls, sports complexes, etc – facilities that may not be suitable for being converted into CHCs. The CCCs are simple isolation wards with beds without oxygen support, they have nurses and paramedics deployed, and health officers visit the centres every day to check on the health status of those lodged. Doctors are kept in the loop only for emergencies.Most patients lodged in the CCCs are individuals who do not have the facility of a separate room for isolation in their residence or those sharing the residence with elderly people, pregnant women or relatives with co-morbidities, said a senior government official.Other than the 10 CCCs, which are managed by the government and are free, several hotels in the city have also been offering paid isolation facility to Covid patients with mild symptoms.WHAT’S THE REARRANGEMENT?According to Delhi government records, till Saturday, when the rearrangement was finalised, Delhi had 5,974 beds spread across 10 Covid care centres – the infrastructure ranged from a hotel and a community centre to several unoccupied apartments under different government agencies. The Capital also had 344 beds spread across three Covid health centres – one of them an Ayurveda college, one a hospital and the other a dharamshala.Before the rearrangement on Saturday, less than 20% beds in the 10 CCCs were occupied, compared to more than 40% beds occupied in the three CHCs, the records showed.“With the home isolation management system working fine, the occupancy percentage of Covid care centres in the city dropped. Most of them are patients with mild symptoms who do not qualify for home isolation for some reason or the other,” said a senior official in the Delhi health minister’s office.After the rearrangement on Saturday, government records showed, the Capital now has 344 beds spread across the same 10 CCCs as large parts of them have been separated, upgraded in terms of infrastructure requirement and converted into CHCs. So, now there are 13 CHCs in the city in total, including the three which already existed earlier. The CHCs cumulatively have as many as 5,909 beds.WHY WAS IT DONE?“The rearrangement was necessary because, in the days to come, the city will need more beds in Covid health centres so that more hospital beds can remain free for severe patients. And not all temporary facilities in sports complexes and banquet halls will be suitable for being converted into CHC. So, those can be turned into new CCC facilities,” said a senior official in the Delhi health minister’s office.He further said, “At this stage, we have adequate oxygen facility and all required resources available with us to run Covid health centres with augmented capacity.”The official further said, the rearrangement exercise was in the final stages but it had to be stopped on Friday evening when the L-G issued an order making five days of institutional quarantine mandatory for all individuals who test Covid-positive. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government protested against the order and, on Saturday, Baijal rolled it back.“The government wasted no time and finalised the rearrangement on Saturday night. The patients with some symptoms were moved to the CHCs for the remaining period of their quarantine and around 10% of them who have no symptoms are still in the CCCs with few days of quarantine left,” the official said.After the rearrangement on Saturday, around 43% of beds in the CCCs are occupied against around 19% in the CHCs, the government records showed.Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, said: “It is a good move to augment the capacity of CHCs as long as the government can ensure that the quality of service does not drop and there is no compromise on the parameters set by the Union government. The government should also have trained staff for the CHCs. It should be treated as a semi hospital.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-rearranging-beds-to-augment-capacity-for-treatment-of-serious-covid-patients/story-dKqG0oHxFh3h9H28xaHAyJ.html
22-06-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi schools set to continue online classes after summer break||While schools in Delhi will reopen after the summer break next month, classes are likely to continue to be conducted virtually, amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Officials at both government and private schools said that with infections surging in the national capital, chances of calling students to school are bleak for July. While junior classes (nursery to class 8) enjoyed a summer break from May 11, classes for the rest shut from May 29. With the country going into a lockdown to contain the spread of the virus on March 25, schools too were shut.Schools switched to learning via video conferencing, recorded video and audio lectures over WhatsApp, and activities on emails.Both the CBSE and the NCERT are revising the syllabi and the assessment process for the academic year 2020-21 in view of the disruption brought about by the pandemic. Several private schools in Delhi are conducting teachers’ training programmes next week to prepare them for online classes. Manju Sethi, principal of Bluebells School International, said that the school will first conduct two-day class-wise orientation for the students. “On July 1 and 2, we will speak to our students via video conferencing to brief them about the situation. It’s not a normal situation and we’ll have to inform them about the changes CBSE and NCERT will bring to the syllabus and assessment process this year. This will be followed by regular online classes. Earlier in April, we had to suddenly switch the mode of learning. Our teachers are preparing themselves to better use technology now,” she said.Ameeta Wattal, principal of Springdales School, said, “From Monday onwards we will hold a week-long training session for our teachers to prepare the pedagogies of online classes. We will try to make them as inclusive and interactive as possible. The school will resume online classes in the first week of July.”Following complaints from parents about their children spending a lot of time in front of the screens, some schools are also planning to increase offline activities. “We have reduced the screen time by 25--30% for all the classes with more activities-based work to the students. Now, teachers will send them briefings and the students will do the work at home. We are even ready with the timetable also,” said Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu School in Rohini. The school will resume online classes from July 1.The Directorate of Education (DoE) also plans to resume online activities in their schools from July first week. Binay Bhushan, director of the DoE, said the government schools will resume online classes through video conferencing and activities through WhatsApp and SMS. “This time we will come up with a wider outreach programme to cover maximum students. We have also distributed books to the students. It will be easier for them now, comparatively,” he said. The government has been planning to rope in a TV channel to broadcast classes.The schools under the east civic body have also been asked to prepare worksheets for students who do not have access to devices and the internet. Vibha Singh, principal of an east MCD school in Gandhi Nagar, said, “The teachers have been asked to prepare the worksheets so that parents whose kids do not have access to online learning can collect them from schools. In this way, we can engage the students at home without devices.” Some parents fear that their students will be excluded from the education system. “The pandemic has taken a huge toll on the poor. My two sons could not attend any online class in April and May due to the lack of a device. The situation is still not favourable to open schools. How will kids like my sons study?” said Joginder, a mason, whose two sons are enrolled in a government school in Karawal Nagar.Others such as Darshan Ram,17, a class 12 student at Bluebells School International, misses going to school. “I had ever imagined that I would not get a chance to wear my uniform even once in the final school year. I miss my friends. I miss the classroom environment and the hundreds of activities we used to do in school. I am just hoping I get a chance to wear my school uniform just for once before graduating. There is so much uncertainty about the reopening of schools,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-delhi-schools-set-to-continue-online-classes-after-summer-break/story-1yWzPCDmdGVFeow7vVmmFL.html

22-06-2020||Delhi||Traffic on key Metro stretches higher than before lockdown||With Delhi Metro services shut since March 22 in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a significant rise in traffic volume, particularly on stretches where the Metro was the preferred mode of transportation, after lockdown restrictions were eased. According to estimates by the Delhi Traffic Police, since June 1, when travel rules were relaxed, the traffic volume on at least 12 key stretches is much higher than what it was before the national lockdown was imposed.For instance, at the main Rajouri Garden intersection (below the Metro station) in west Delhi, the average traffic volume recorded during peak hours was consistently between 80,000 and 85,000 vehicles since 2018. However, over the last 20 days, traffic police have been recording around 180,000 vehicles crossing the junction during peak hours every day.Before the Rajouri Garden Metro Station was converted into a connecting station between the Blue (Dwarka Sector 21-Vaishali/Noida Electronic City) and Pink (Maujpur-Shiv Vihar) lines in July 2018, the intersection used to get a traffic volume of around 125,000 vehicles every day.Officials said this direct correlation between the Metro and traffic volume was visible in other areas as well.“The traffic volume on the entire Najafgarh Road was eased to a great extent after the Metro began operations. This is primarily because the stretch is not well connected on public bus service routes. In the absence of the Metro, anyone who owns a vehicle is now forced to use those,” said a senior traffic official, who asked not to be named. Similarly, at the Uttam Nagar crossing (near the bus terminal) in east Delhi, traffic volume has increased from 110,000 vehicles to nearly 200,000 vehicles every day.In Mukarba Chowk, barely 200 metres from the Jahangirpuri Metro station, the traffic volume has gone up to 75,000 vehicles during peak traffic rush. Before the lockdown, the volume used to be between 50,000-60,000 vehicles a day, according to official data.Police personnel stationed in these areas said that in the absence of commuting options, shared services such as gramin sewas, mini-buses and other unauthorised commuting services have gained prominence, adding to the traffic load.Other stretches where the traffic movement has increased are Dwarka Road near Sadar Bazar (Delhi Cantonment), the Ring Road near Delhi Cantonment Metro station, Dilshad Garden intersection near the Jhilmil Metro station, Munirka crossing, and Hauz Khas crossing on the Outer Ring Road and the Nehru Place intersection (towards Greater Kailash). Traffic experts said the Delhi Metro, when functional, reduces vehicular volume on several busy stretches. Sewa Ram, professor of traffic engineering at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), said that with fewer viable and dependable public transport modes available now, people are forced to use their personal vehicles.“A lot of offices have resumed, and several people who own vehicles but used the Metro for travel are now forced to use their vehicles instead. The passenger restriction in public buses has also increased the number of two-wheelers on the road,” he said.Buses in Delhi were allowed to ply from May 19, but can only carry up to 20 passengers at a time.Ram also emphasised that traffic volume would continue to increase in the coming months, and that people who own vehicles may prefer to shun public transport, for health reasons. Delhi recorded 3,000 new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, taking the total in the city to 59,746. Of these, 2,175 people have died, and 33,013 have recovered.“In public transport, there is always a fear of contracting the infection. Even after the Metro reopens, there is a chance that the ridership will remain low and the use of private vehicles will shoot up,” Ram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/traffic-on-key-metro-stretches-higher-than-before-lockdown/story-ZabeqoQAH89wDZ0fMbK1bO.html
22-06-2020||City||ED books 20, including two Pak nationals, for money laundering||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has booked 20 persons, including at least two Pakistanis, under money laundering charges in the case of seizure of 532-kg of heroin and 52-kg of mixed narcotics at the Attari border in June 2019. The Customs had seized the contraband, being smuggled in a consignment of rock salt from Pakistan, at the Integrated Check Post (ICP).The accused have been identified as Ranjeet Singh, alias Rana (kingpin); Tariq Ahmad Lone; Farook Lone; Sohaib Noor and Amir Noor, the Pakistan nationals; Jasbir Singh; Nirbhail Singh; Sandeep Kaur; Ajay Gupta; Iqbal Singh; Amit Gambhir, alias Bobby, a resident of Amritsar and others. Sources privy to the development said the ED would seek documents, including bank accounts and investigation details, from the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is conducting the probe. “We have been tracing the money trail in the drugs network and will question the accused soon,” a senior ED official, not authorised to speak to the media, told HT. In July 2019, the NIA had taken over the probe and filed two charge-sheets against 17 persons, arrested for their alleged involvement in this case in the NIA special court at Mohali under sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.In May this year, the NIA and police of Punjab and Haryana, in a joint operation, had arrested Ranjit Singh alias Rana, the kingpin of the racket, and his brother Gagandeep from their hideout at Begu village in Sirsa. In a supplementary charge-sheet the same month, the NIA had said that investigation had revealed evidence of generation of funds through the sale of narcotics smuggled across the international border for funding terrorist activities in Jammu & Kashmir.In its first charge-sheet filed in December 2019, the NIA had said, “This is a case of narco-terrorism, having national and international implications with evidence of generation of funds through the proceeds of sale of narcotics smuggled from across the international border.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/headshoulder532-kg-heroin-haulheadline-ed-books-20-including-two-pak-nationals-for-money-laundering/story-pSGeGh4wNlfTIMqRMcMabI.html
22-06-2020||Mumbai||AAI completes trials for aircraft surveillance tech||India will soon make further forays into space-based technologies through an application for surveillance and safety by providing automatic and constant updates of aircraft location while flying over oceanic regions. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has successfully completed backup trials with the space-based Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), used in all aircraft, technology that allows an aircraft to automatically send its location updates via satellites to air traffic controllers. Currently, unless a pilot himself updates his location (send timely signals) while flying in oceanic regions, the location of an aircraft remains unknown to controllers. Experts said that with this technology, chances of incidents like the disappearance of Malaysian airline aircraft can be avoided. After successful trials, AAI plans to start using the technology to keep surveillance over complete oceanic traffic within the Indian airspace.Space-based ADS-B is a technology made by a company named Aireon which has been certified as an air navigation service provider (ANSP) for ADS-B by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), an agency of the European Union with responsibility for civil aviation safety. Aireon has been providing their service to NAV Canada (the country’s civil air navigation), Seychelles and the United Kingdom. AAI will be the first ANSP in South Asia to start operating space-based ADS-B.When ADS-B is in use, an aircraft broadcasts its position with the help of its on-board computer system while the ground-based sensors receive these ADS-B signals which are then picked up by the local air traffic control (ATC) for keeping surveillance over an aircraft. Since these reports are accurate, it not only enhances passenger safety but also lets ATCs to efficiently use the reports to apply optimum separations between two aircraft flying in the same region, which also results in increasing the capacity of a given airspace. Officials privy to the development said some security concerns with the ADS-B signals were initially raised, but these doubts have been cleared gradually and ADS-B is gaining confidence from ATCs and pilots to be used as a surveillance tool across the world. Many countries have mandated this technology as an essential equipment for aircraft. Similarly India’s regulatory body, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), from January 1, 2020 mandated all Indian aircraft to be equipped with the technology. Following this, AAI entered an agreement with the company and has been testing the technology in their back-up system. Currently Chennai and Mumbai airports are running the trails. “We have already started receiving the signals and we are running trials in the back-up system. We keep cross-checking data received via satellites, and till date we have found all the information to be timely and accurate for the aircraft. The system gets refreshed every eight seconds, which means that we get an updated location along with various other details of all the aircraft flying in the oceanic region every eight seconds. This technology is also able to give the latest location details with a maximum delay of just two seconds,” said a senior Delhi-based AAI official. The official added, “We have a system in place called as ADS-C (used by 60% aircraft) which sends automatic messages through satellites every 27 minutes, and hence raises concern on aviation safety due to excessive time difference in receiving updates.”To ensure maximum air safety to passengers, the Indian continental air space is now covered by ADS-B receivers that are placed all over the country for keeping continuous surveillance over any aircraft flying within the Indian airspace. “This technology does not need a line of sight; no hindrances can affect the accuracy and speed of the signals received by an ATC. A link between their US-based station and Mumbai has been established and that’s how ADS-B signals are being received by the ATCs,” said a Mumbai-based AAI official. “The date of running this technology in full-fledge is being negotiated,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aai-completes-trials-for-aircraft-surveillance-tech/story-7PG5CzI4cZya2MBLYMhyMN.html
22-06-2020||Mumbai||IIT-B designs electronic neuron to make devices faster||A team of researchers led by the Indian Institute of Technology- Bombay (IIT-B) have designed an electronic neuron that mimics the nerve cells or the neurons of a human brain and can help devices make faster decisions.The study, published in the journal APL Materials of the American Institute of Physics in September last year, proposes a theoretical framework of neural networks - an active field of research in machine learning - that can enable computers to perform everyday tasks such as image, voice and pattern recognition. In simpler terms, the neurons will improve the results of facial recognition, voice recognition and understanding of languages.For instance, currently, electronic gadgets such as computers and mobile phones are based on Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. In this technology, the device will go through millions of possibilities before reaching an answer when prompted for facial recognition. The neural network proposed by the team can bypass the possibilities and reach an optimal answer much more quickly.“Today, a lot of neural networks are focussed on software that runs on the cloud, which has ample energy to work as they are supported by dedicated server farms,” said Udayan Ganguly, principal investigator and professor from the electrical engineering department, IIT-Bombay. “Unlike most computer hardware designed over the past few decades that served well with simple programs to perform functions such as counting, today complex problems such as searching for an optimal route for a drone need programs with artificial stochastic neurons,” he added.“Neurons or activation functions are essential components for neural networks, and their realisation such as the one demonstrated in this study, is a valuable development from the perspective of hardware implementation,” said Manan Suri, assistant professor at IIT Delhi and lead, non-volatile memory and neuromorphic research group, who was not a part of the study.Essentially, the team at IIT-Bombay comprising faculty, undergraduate and postgraduate studentsalong with engineers from Intel have designed a resistive random access memory (RRAM) that uses artificial neurons to build a network which can help computers solve problems such as finding the optimal route for a drone.The team considered an existing theoretical framework of neural networks called a Boltzmann machine - a deep learning model to optimise a solution to a problem.“A Boltzmann machine can enable everyday tasks like image, voice and pattern recognition,” said Ganguly adding that the stochasticity (randomness) in Boltzmann machine results in the ability to statistically estimate the output, which is unnatural for deterministic machines. The project was funded partly by the Department of Science and Technology’s Nano Mission and Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY).The RRAM was built using a crystalline manganite (PrxCa1−xMnO3) which can act as a memorydevice. Researchers tested and compared the performance of the newly designed RRAM with that of conventional silicon-based hardware. Results showed their hardware design solved a problem with 98% accuracy and needed just one-tenth of the area of conventionalsemiconductor-based hardware. Its power efficiency was also found to be four times better than CMOS.“This implies that a Boltzmann machine chip, based on RRAM may be computationally more powerful and energy-efficient,” Ganguly said. Researchers have filed for a patent on this work. “The devices are in the experimental stage, but the chip design needs to be implemented in devices. Such systems are of great commercial interest and would be interesting for high-tech start-ups,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-b-designs-electronic-neuron-to-make-devices-faster/story-8C5FSuTl7oNFepIfH1MCzM.html
22-06-2020||City||Over 57,000 apply for undergrad courses at DU on Sunday||New Delhi: As many as 57,312 applicants registered for admissions to undergraduate courses at Delhi University (DU) by 5pm on Sunday. While 18,837 had registered online for postgraduate courses and 2,071 registered for PhD, university officials said.DU on Saturday started the online registration process for admission to its various undergraduate, postgraduate, Mphil, and PhD courses. Applicants will get a two-week window ending on July 4 to register for the courses. There are over 64,000 undergraduate seats available in DU colleges.In 2019, applicants got an over three-week window from May 30 to June 22 to register for admissions and the first cut-off list was announced on June 28. This year, however, the Covid-19 pandemic has delayed the admission schedule. The dates of the first cut-off are yet to be decided as the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is yet to conduct its twelve main class 12 papers. The exams are due to be held between July 1 and 15. Although some applicants had complained about the university’s website crashing on Saturday, the registration process went smooth on Sunday. “There was some issue yesterday which was later fixed after the university contacted the service provider last night. No issue was reported on Sunday,” said a senior university official.Several changes have also been introduced in the admission process this year due to the Covid pandemic. While the admission under the extra-curricular activities quota, except for NCC and NSS, has been scrapped, sports admission will be based on certificates. The entire admission process will go online this year with students not having to go to the colleges for the verification of the documents, unlike previous years. The verification will be done online.The university has made a provision under which candidates will be applicable to take admission in any course if they meet the cut-off. “Earlier students had to select the courses of their choice while applying. But this time students are considered in all courses by default. They can take admission in any course if they meet the cut-off,” said Dean of admissions Shobha Bagai. Instead of ‘Open days’ sessions, the university will conduct webinars this year to help answer the questions that candidates have regarding the admission procedure. The first such webinar will be held on Tuesday between 11 am to 1 pm. “Candidates aspiring for admission in undergraduate courses and their parents can attend the live webinar and understand the admission process. The colleges will also organise their counselling sessions during the admission process,” the university said in a statement on Sunday.The University has also issued helpline numbers for the candidates -- 9899179530, 9971155832, 9311307156, 9149002539, 8595760622 and 9311380716.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-57-000-apply-for-undergrad-courses-at-du-on-sunday/story-5mT7YJ3Ne93jC0RLh0dYaO.html

The woman’s live-in partner had given her the money for safekeeping.The 48-year-old complainant builder approached the Kopar Khairane police on Wednesday, claiming the amount was stolen from his second-floor apartment. A case of house break-in theft was registered against an unknown person based on the builder’s complaint.According to the complainant, his live-in partner was admitted to hospital on Monday, and when he went to pick up the money from the house, he realized it was missing.“The woman told the builder that someone may have stolen the money through the window as they were in the hospital for two days. She thought the man would not approach the police due to the coronavirus lockdown. When we investigated, we did not find any foul play. No one suspect was seen on the CCTV footage entering the building,” said an officer from Kopar Khairane police station.Officers then inquired with the woman about the money, after which she confessed to spending the amount to repay her mortgage. She had mortgaged her jewelry and also taken a ₹3 lakh loan. Using the builder’s money, she recovered her jewelry and repaid the loan, said police.Police are yet to decide if the woman will be booked under the same charges of theft or for cheating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/builder-s-live-in-partner-steals-4-07-lakh-sends-police-chasing-fictitious-burglar/story-x2ldNmoDGe970xQI60QyqL.html

Officials say that those who have recovered are reluctant to come back to hospital, also fearing that the donation of plasma might make them weak. The district has 224 active cases. Under this promising, but yet unproven treatment called convalescent plasma therapy, the antibody-rich blood plasma of patients who have recovered from covid-19 is preserved for transfusion into critical patients.On June 19, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) allowed the GMCH to treat covid-19 patients with plasma therapy, but the hospital had started a hunt for donors around 15 days ago. ICMR stipulates that plasma of only those who had been critically-ill before recovering can be used.  Blood bank in-charge at GMCH Dr Neeraj said, “For the past 15 days, specialist doctors and I have been regularly contacting recovered patients, but no one is ready to be a donor. We have a list of around 20 eligible recovered persons, who can donate plasma. Just three have shown some interest, but have also sought 10-15 days to think.” He added, “There are misconceptions about the process. We have also roped in hospital counsellors to persuade recovered patients. Hopefully, we will find donors soon to start treatment.”“It is not possible to harvest plasma from patients, while they are undergoing treatment. It has to be done about two weeks after recovery, at which stage people are reluctant to come back to hospitals. The hospital has approached family members of former Golden Temple hazuri ragi Padma Shri Late Bhai Nirmal Singh Khalsa, but they categorically refused. A 24-year-old resident of Jandiala Guru also refused,” said a senior doctor of GMCH, who did not wish to be named. “GMCH Amritsar has treated covid-19 patients from Hoshiarpur and Pathankot too. They have also refused,” he added. To date, the Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital, Faridkot, has conducted Punjab’s only convalescent plasma therapy as part of novel treatment modality for coronavirus. GMC Patiala is scheduled to start the therapy soon. STRAP/BLURBGovernment Medical College, Amritsar, has got approval to start this promising, but unproven treatment and has been looking for donors for critically-ill patients for past 15 days without success||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/despite-500-covid-19-recoveries-no-donor-for-plasma-therapy-in-amritsar/story-5ewaMI7In7fT6199RG3FnK.html

It planned to launch these two projects in January-March quarter of the last fiscal, but deferred it because of the coronavirus outbreak in India and the subsequent nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25. Puravankara recently launched the two projects on digital platforms, the company’s MD Ashish R Puravankara told PTI. In the first project, ‘Provident Woodfield’, the company will develop 356 plots, mostly residential, on a 25 acre land parcel at Electronic City in Bengaluru. The total investment in this project is around Rs 80 crore and will be delivered by 2023-end. The plots are available in a price range of Rs 21 lakh to Rs 76 lakh, he said. In the second project, ‘Purva Atmosphere’, which is spread over 13 acres at Thanisandra in Bengaluru, the company will construct 939 units, priced Rs 95 lakh onwards. The project is expected to be completed by March 2025 with an estimated investment of Rs 1,000 crore, Ashish said. “Both our projects were planned to be launched in Q4FY20. In the past few months, we saw a steady rise in customer sentiment veering towards homes as their safe investment option. Seeing this latent demand, we accelerated our plans and process, which helped us in planning these launches,” he added. In the current situation, he said the aim is to make it convenient for buyers to access projects at the click of a button from anywhere in the world. “Puravankara Group has always believed in presenting the right product at the right location and right price. Extensive research and assessment are done in identifying locations,” he said. He mentioned that the company’s quasi book building method to sell properties has proved to be successful for price discovery. In the last four decades, Puravankara Ltd has completed and delivered more than 40 million sq ft area. It has presence in southern and western parts of India. The company sells premium apartments under the Puravankara brand and affordable homes under the Provident brand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/real-estate/realty-firm-puravankara-to-invest-rs-1-100-cr-on-2-new-housing-projects-in-bengaluru/story-TTJykoEiEM8ukg6j1TXjzN.html
22-06-2020||City||Noida Golf Course fined ₹25 lakh by NGT for illegally extracting groundwater||Noida: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has slapped an interim fine of ₹25 lakh on the Noida Golf Course for allegedly illegally extracting groundwater through tube wells and using the same for horticulture purposes to meet its 500 kilo litres-per day (KLD) demand. The final assessment of total environmental damage is yet to be assessed, which is the reason the fine imposed by NGT is interim. The next date of hearing is in November.An NGT bench, headed by NGT chairperson and Justice Adarsh Goyal, in a hearing through video conferencing on June 19, the order of which was available on Sunday, observed that the Noida Golf Course (NGC) situated at Sector 43 had been drawing groundwater through five different tube wells illegally and using it for the horticulture use (watering the grasses and plants, etc.).Noida is one of those regions where water resources are scarce, with a groundwater depletion rate of around two metres per year. According to the district ground water department’s assessment last year, the average availability of water in Noida is 24 metres deep, while the availability at Sector 39, which is near the golf course, is 29.58 metres.“We direct the Noida Golf Course, Noida, Gautam Budh Nagar to pay interim compensation of Rs 25 lakh which may be deposited with the CPCB within one month from today. The payment of compensation will be a condition for continued operation of the establishments. The said establishments are given liberty to present their viewpoint before the Committee and this Tribunal which will be duly considered while finalising the compensation and other directions,” said the bench in its interim order against a petition filed by Noida-based environmentalist Vikrant Tongad.The tribunal stated that the groundwater has been over-exploited for commercial purposes despite Noida falling under the critical and semi-critical zone for water sources. “This Tribunal has held that ground water cannot be used for playgrounds like cricket grounds, particularly in over-exploited, critical and semi-critical areas, which observation also applies to Golf Course. In view of depleting ground water, there is threat of irreversible damage to the acquifiers and salinity of the water. Moreover, it is leading to scarcity of drinking water, thereby depriving a section of the society from access to potable water which is already scarce,” the green court stated. The officials at the golf club, however, asserted that while the club had been closed due to the lockdown, they are switching to alternate water resources.“We have already stopped the use of groundwater by extraction, and currently are using treated water through the Noida authority. I am yet to see the NGT order for now,” said BS Dagar, manager, Noida Golf Course.The Tribunal also observed that the quality of water conserved through rain water harvesting system in the golf course was also not up to the mark in terms of hardness. Its contents like Calcium, Arsenic, Copper, Lead, Chromium, Nickel, Iron and Manganese were also exceeding the BIS standards.“In Noida Golf Course there are five tube wells for supplying ground water for drinking, domestic and horticulture purposes, in which two tube wells are dismantled and abandoned. In the rest three tube wells, two tube wells are operational and one is in maintenance. The water meters are not installed on the tube wells and log book is also not maintained for operation of tube wells. So the quantity of ground water withdrawal cannot be known,” the NGT order stated.According to the petitioner, ground water exploitation is a key issue that’s not given enough attention. “Gautam Budh Nagar is already water stressed and such irresponsible behaviour is making it worse. Examples have to be made so that issues like groundwater depletion are taken seriously,” said Tongad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-golf-course-fined-25-lakh-by-ngt-for-illegally-extracting-groundwater/story-azECS462C7jw3YAtdIj7qM.html

As many as 8,547 candidates had registered for the exam but 1,166 remained absent.The written exam was conducted by the Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS) and 84 exam centres were set up at Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran, Ferozepur, Hosiarpur, Jalandhar, Faridkot, Muktsar, Fazilka, Ludhiana, Mohali, Patiala, Ropar and Sangrur. BFUHS vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur said that social distancing norms were strictly followed during the exam. “We conducted thermal scanning and all candidates wrote the exam wearing masks. It was very important due to Covid-19 outbreak. We were able to conduct the examination successfully. A separate exam centre was set up at the isolation ward of Rajindra hospital in Patiala for two candidates who tested positive for Covid-19 and were under treatment there.“We did not let any candidate miss the exam even if they tested positive. Two candidates were allowed to give the exam at a special examination centre set up at the isolation ward of Rajindra hospital.

22-06-2020||Delhi||CISF commandos take to online videos to hone their skills||For these Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) men, mornings have changed.The early morning whistles, which beckoned them to the parade ground for physical exercise training or to the armoury for weapons training, has been missing ever since the raging Covid-19 pandemic started taking a toll in Delhi-NCR.The commandos of the quick reaction teams (QRT) of the CISF are these days practising their daily drills through tutorial videos sent to them by their supervisors over smartphones.From assembling weapons to use of bomb-detecting equipment and from yoga tutorials to cardio exercises as a substitute to their daily running drills, the videos explain everything. These videos promptly land every morning at the usual training time, with the commandos expected to follow them and practice while staying inside their barracks.  The commandos even record their own videos, practising physical training, and send it back to their supervisors in-charge.At present, the Central force — that has around 20,000 personnel guarding Delhi Metro, IGI airport and government buildings in Delhi — has recorded 79 positive cases of Covid-19. All the infected jawans are either in isolation at the force’s facility in outer Delhi’s Narela or have been sent to AIIMS Jhajjar, Haryana, for treatment.In Delhi Metro, CISF has 110 QRTs, each having six personnel. Another senior officer said because Metro operations are shut, only 30% strength of QRTs is being used. “We are deploying them on alternate days so that chances of infection are less and we have a backup team ready at any given time,” the second officer said.Ever since a nationwide lockdown was put in place in March this year to contain the spread of Covid-19, and operations of Delhi Metro shut, these CISF men were pulled out and sent to different barracks across the city to ensure social distancing. Since the lockdown, only minimum strength of personnel, including the QRTs, is being used for the security of Metro stations.Metro services in Delhi have remained suspended since March 22, when the Janta curfew was observed. While other modes of public transport have been allowed, with restrictions, during the gradual easing of lockdown norms, Metro services continues to remain shut for now.Senior officers said the tutorial videos are being circulated among the QRTs because these commandos haven’t undertaken any rigorous physical activity or arms training since the last week of March owing to restrictions put in place as part of safety guidelines to contain the spread of coronavirus.“The assembly of these commandos is not possible for their regular training sessions, like earlier, on a daily basis. So we have started circulating videos. While videos of stripping and assembling of weapons, which they can watch and revise, are sent thrice a week, videos of Krav Maga, the martial arts they are trained in are sent every day along with videos of physical training,” said a senior officer, who wished not to be named. The officer said QRTs are made up of the best of the best commandos and they have the minimum reaction time to any situation. “We train our men and women in QRTs to strip and assemble an INSAS rifle in 20 seconds. For an AK-47 they take about 30 seconds and only 8-10 seconds for a Glock pistol. Because their training sessions have been suspended, the tutorial videos help them refresh and revise the procedure at least three times a week, like earlier,” the officer said.Similarly, videos of bomb-detecting equipment are also sent to the commandos so that they remember the technicalities.The officer said that this is important so that their response time is not affected. He added that apart from tactical training, because the commandos can’t go for their daily run, they are sent videos of yoga sessions and cardio exercise everyday which can be an absolute substitute for running. “They have been asked to practice their daily physical training on their own. We also randomly ask them to send us their recordings while practising physical exercises to keep a check on them,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/in-times-of-pandemic-cisf-commandos-take-to-online-videos-to-hone-their-skills/story-50YIHhFekRcwktXEqtpITI.html

Director general (prisons) Sandeep Goel informed the committee about the death of the inmate on Saturday. The committee headed by Justice Hima Kohli was told that 62-year-old Kanwar Singh passed away in his sleep. His Covid test came out positive on Saturday. Kanwar Singh was serving life imprisonment in a 2016 murder case registered at the Aman Vihar police station and was sent to jail on July 6, 2018. Goel said he was sharing the jail cell with 28 other inmates “who were doing fine”. The committee directed the officials to test the 28 inmates immediately to prevent the spread of the disease in the prison complex.The DG (prisons) also informed the committee that till Saturday, 36 jail staffers and 20 prisoners in Mandoli, Tihar and Rohini, the three prisons in Delhi, have been found Covid positive. The DG said that all Covid positive jail staff were relieved of their duties and asked to remain in home quarantine, as all of them were asymptomatic. He said all those who had come in their contact were also tested. Goel said of the 36 jail staff who were found positive (till June 20), seven have already recovered and tested negative. Only two of those jail staff required hospitalisation, two are in institutional quarantine facility whereas the remaining 25 are in home quarantined, Goel said. He also said that till Saturday, 20 inmates had tested positive out of which 16 have recovered and one has died.Following this, the committee resolved that new prisoners between 18 and 21 years of age be kept in isolation wards and asked the DG (prisons) and special secretary (home) of the Delhi government to turn the 360 vacant police quarters, situated close to Mandoli jail, into a temporary jail to create isolation ward for new prisoners and those who test positive.The committee also said that all jail hospitals must be equipped with oxygen concentrators and two such machines for each of the two jail hospitals must be procured at the earliest.The committee also sought to know about the availability of some other space which can be converted into a ‘temporary jail’. DG (prisons) Goel stated that in consultation with Delhi Police, they have identified police quarters in Mandoli are being used as government’s medical quarantine facility for Covid patients.He said that they have spoken to the Delhi government for making the quarters available for making a temporary jail. He informed that the quarters comprises of 12 towers with 30 flats each. He said the flats can be used for holding 1800 new inmates.The committee directed the DG (prisons) as well as special secretary (home) to make concerted efforts for getting the nod from the Delhi government at the earliest. It also added two new category of prisoners—undertrial prisoners facing jail in 498A (domestic violence) and 304B (dowry death) --who can be now released on interim bail.The committee was told that till date 4,129 inmates/ convicts/undertrial prisoners have been released on parole/interim bail. Despite that, the prison population continue to be 13,677 as on June 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/first-death-in-delhi-jails-prompts-panel-to-order-rapid-test-on-all-new-entrants/story-5SDiBDbNdvajgNvKTiCW7N.html
22-06-2020||Delhi||Extortion racket being run from Tihar jail busted, three held||The Delhi Police on Sunday said they arrested three men who were allegedly running an extortion racket from Tihar Jail in Delhi. The police said the arrested men included the mastermind who would allegedly demand money from builders and businessmen over the phone from inside the jail and then direct his men outside to threaten the targets until they paid. The man had recently asked a builder in Karol Bagh to pay him ₹20 lakh.The police have identified the arrested mastermind as Mahesh alias Mannu, 39, a resident of Karol Bagh. The police said he was previously involved in two murder cases, one attempt to murder case and several cases of assault and illegal possession of arms. He has been lodged in Tihar Jail since 2014. His two aides were identified as Bhanu Pratap, 21, from Sangam Vihar and Ashok Kumar, 40, from Karol Bagh.According to the police, on November 28, 2019, one Jugal Kishore, 62, of Karol Bagh, who ran a construction business, alleged that he was receiving multiple WhatsApp voice calls by some Mahesh asking him to pay ₹20 lakh as extortion amount. He said the caller asked him to pay the amount in instalments of ₹50,000 each and also threatened him against reporting the matter to the police and said he would face dire consequences if he did so. The police said that when the builder refused to pay, two men fired a bullet outside his house the next week. Mahesh then called him again and told him that if he didn’t pay the money he’d be shot dead, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Sanjay Bhatia said that during the investigation, call records of the number from which the builder had been called and of many connected numbers were checked. During technical surveillance, a team from the Karol Bagh police station finally zeroed in on one Ashok Kumar suspected of being involved in threatening the builder. He was immediately arrested. “His interrogation further revealed that another man, Bhanu Pratap, was also involved in the extortion bid. Our team raided a hideout in Karol Bagh and arrested Pratap. During questioning, the duo disclosed that both of them were promised good monetary returns and that they were acting on Mahesh’s directions. They also admitted to having opened fire outside the builder’s house,” Bhatia said.The DCP said that further probe revealed that Mahesh has been operating the extortion racket from inside the jail. “Mahesh who was already in jail was arrested in this case also after obtaining permission of the court. His remand has been sought to probe how he was able to access phones inside the jail. Jail authorities are also being informed,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/extortion-racket-being-run-from-tihar-jail-busted-three-held/story-Bcmw6GrcKsA0Sa4l3jWN0O.html
22-06-2020||City||Cloudy skies play spoiler as people gather to watch the rare ‘ring of fire’||New Delhi: Cloudy skies played a spoiler for star gazers who came out to witness the annular solar eclipse in the national capital on Sunday. Many complained that they could not get a clear view of the eclipse due to the overcast in Delhi, owing to the pre-monsoon showers. Around 10.20am on Sunday when the sun started appearing like a ‘ring of fire’ in the cloud, many people who were anxiously waiting to view this rare sight complained of low visibility because of a cloudy sky. Unlike in a total eclipse, the moon in an annular, or ring-like, eclipse is unable to completely cover the sun, leaving a thin halo of light at its maximum phase. Such an eclipse happens when the moon is farther away in its elliptical orbit around the Earth, appearing smaller as a result.OP Sharma from Delhi’s Nehru Planetarium, where arrangements were made to watch the eclipse, said that because of Covid-19 the planetarium restricted the entry of general public but hosted scientists, researchers and media houses. The eclipse was also broadcast live on TV channels for the convenience of the people.“The sun, moon and the earth come in a straight line but because of the distance between the moon and the sun, the moon did not completely cover the sun and that is how we saw the ring of fire,” explained Sharma.At 12.10pm, Delhi saw 94% obscuration of the sun by the moon. Sunday was also a rare occasion because it was day of the summer solstice, the first day of the summer. June 21 also marked the longest day of the year. The summer solstice occurs between June 20 and 22 every year. Solar eclipses on the summer solstice are rare. The last one was in June 2001. According to a Reuters report which quoted NASA data, a “ring of fire” eclipse that falls exactly in midsummer - whether in the northern or southern hemisphere - is even more uncommon. There have been none in at least 100 years. The next one is in 2039, and then in 2392. Rakesh Kumar, an astronomy enthusiast, said he had arranged for a telescope in terrace of his house to witness the eclipse but the overcast skies did not allow a clear view.“I could witness it because the telescope wasn’t powerful enough and view was not very clear too. There were people who were trying to click pictures through their cameras and got a hazy photo because of the clouds,” Kumar said.Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that Delhi witnessed a cloudy morning and afternoon on Sunday with light rain in some parts of the city.“We have been witnessing cloudy skies because of pre-monsoon showers. This meant that even though the eclipse was visible, it was not very clear,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cloudy-skies-play-spoiler-as-people-gather-to-watch-the-rare-ring-of-fire/story-7rN7Q8y1vHCb6XIyLJCfYN.html
22-06-2020||Delhi||Robbers target elderly Delhi couple, 88-year-old murdered||An 88-year-old woman was stabbed to death at her house in south Delhi’s Safdarjung Enclave on Saturday evening during a robbery attempted by a security guard she had hired about a fortnight ago. The woman’s husband, 94, a retired officer from the Ministry of External Affairs was also attacked by the guard and his two associates who made away with valuables and cash from the house. However, by Sunday afternoon, a police team arrested the trio and a fourth associate from Gauriphanta in UP (near the Indo-Nepal border) while they were on their way to Nepal. The men had hired a taxi two days in advance to escape after the “planned heist”, the police said.“Four accused have been arrested connection with the murder of an 88-year-old woman in Safdarjung area yesterday. With their arrest, robbed cash of ₹55,000, jewellery and knife used in the commission of crime have been recovered. Further investigation is in progress:,” the Delhi Police said in a statement.One of the arrested men has been identified as Rajesh alias Dimu, 19, the security guard who hails from a village in Nepal. The police said Rajesh had been working in the neighbourhood for the past year and the couple was familiar with him. They had hired him on the recommendation of their maid, who also hails from Nepal. The maid, however, is not involved in the crime, the police clarified.The other three arrested men are Gyanender, 23, Om Singh, 18, and Pramod Pragya, 26, all from Bajhang district in Nepal. All the men worked as security guards in Delhi. Om is Rajesh’s cousin, the others are friends. None of them have a criminal record, the police confirmed.According to the police, the incident took place between 8.20pm and 8.45pm. “The CCTV camera footage from the area established that Om and Gyanender, led by Rajesh, entered the upper ground floor of the four-storey residential building roughly around 8.25pm. As they rang the call bell, Kanta Chawla opened the door. As soon as she let Rajesh into the living room, the other two men followed. The trio overpowered the couple,” an investigator, who did not wish to be named, said. The officer said that when the trio headed for the wardrobe in the bedroom, Kanta Chawla objected and tried to raise an alarm. “This triggered a scuffle and the three men stabbed the elderly woman in the throat. She died on the spot. The men picked up all the cash and valuables from the couple’s bedroom and fled the house,” the officer said. He said the husband somehow alerted those living on the upper floors. They alerted their neighbours and informed the police.Deputy commissioner of police (south-west) Devender Arya said a police team that reached the spot sent the woman’s body to a hospital for an autopsy. “A forensics team was called in to inspect the crime scene. The woman’s husband is 94 years old, he cannot speak much. The house has no CCTV cameras, but footage from a CCTV camera nearby showed three men entering the house around 8.25pm and leaving at 8.47pm. Preliminary probe shows the entry was not forced. But because all of them were wearing surgical masks, we couldn’t identify them,” Arya said. The DCP said that during initial questioning, neighbours told them that the couple had recently hired a security guard on June 5 for round-the-clock assistance. “The guard was missing. His phone was also switched off. Technical surveillance revealed that he had switched his phone off around 6.30pm. We also found that he was of Nepali origin and was hired about a fortnight ago on the recommendation of the couple’s househelp, who also belongs to Nepal,” he said.Arya said that when they interrogated the domestic help, she revealed the details of Rajesh’s hometown and his family. “Meanwhile, a team that was surveilling Rajesh’s phone found that he was in regular touch with one Gyanender, who had also switched off his phone at the same time,” he said.The DCP said this brought Gyanender also on their radar and a team immediately rushed to Tanakpur in Uttar Pradesh (UP), a route usually taken to escape to Nepal. They sent other teams to ISBTs and railway stations to look for the suspects. “Meanwhile, we also alerted the Uttar Pradesh Police. All routes that led to Nepal were put on high alert and vehicles were thoroughly checked. We had also picked up one of Rajesh’s friends who lives in RK Puram to help us identify him. Around 4pm we had a breakthrough when a joint team comprising the UP Police and Delhi Police arrested the foursome from Gauriphanta,” the officer said.He said that during initial questioning, Rajesh and others confessed to have killed Kanta Chawla. “They said they had planned the heist in advance and had also contacted a taxi driver on Thursday. They had told him they want to go to Lakhimpur Kheri on Sunday and that they’d meet him at Safdarjung Hospital. Pramod was not at the crime scene, instead, he was at Safdarjung Hospital coordinating with the hired taxi driver. The driver was paid ₹12,000 with the robbed cash. The driver, who was unaware of their involvement in the crime, dropped them at Lakhimpur Kheri and from there they planned to escape to Rajesh’s village in Nepal,” Arya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/88-year-old-woman-stabbed-to-death-in-safdarjung-enclave-4-arrested/story-ZuLdQgQSFnZSJauOPHpJSL.html
22-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram ‘undertesting’ for Covid-19, say experts||Even with a recent upgrade in testing capacity, Gurugram is not testing enough to reign in the spread of Covid-19, leading to a recent uptick in mortality in the district, according to experts who reviewed an analysis of the health department data. They added that this data point was an indicator of the district’s test positivity rate (TPR, or the number of positive results per test expressed in percentage), which of late has surged in Gurugram.In April, Gurugram was testing an average of 192 samples per day (total tests 4789) and clocked an average TPR of 1 percent. While the samples increased to 257 per day in May (total tests 7958), TPR grew to 9 percent. The number of samples tested, however, need not necessarily equate to the actual number of individuals being tested, as some patients may have given multiple samples to be tested. By May 31, Gurugram had 774 positive cases and 3 deaths. In June, like the rest of the country, these numbers surged and the city had 4427 positive cases and 64 deaths on June 21.While an average of 414 samples per day were tested in June thus far, the TPR has surged to 42.7 percent. Gurugram’s doubling-rate (about 13 days) is among the quickest of India’s 20 worst affected districts.“With rising positivity, one can say that transmission of the virus has not been curbed,” said Dr Lalit Kant, an independent public health consultant and former head of the ICMR’s epidemiology division. Kant added that there is no set benchmark for how many tests need to be conducted in a given region, “You want a lower percentage of the tests to come back positive. If you are seeing positivity at 60, 70, even 80 percent, (either) you simply aren’t testing enough.” Kant, and other experts, also said that rising test positivity may indicate a high, if not increasing, prevalence of the disease within a community. Dheeraj Singh, a Gurugram-based data scientist who has been tracking Covid-19 data in Haryana, drew attention to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended benchmark -- a sustained TPR of 5 percent over two weeks, at which point lockdown restrictions may be eased in a given region. “Assuming that there is already a high incidence of unreported cases within Gurugram, an increase in testing is the most viable way of lowering the TPR, and widening surveillance to find unreported cases,” Singh explained.Thus, going by the current numbers and assuming that the number of new positive cases detected each day remains the same, the district should have conducted at least tested 3100 samples per day to achieve a TPR of 5 percent. “Similarly, by the same extrapolation, a TPR of 10 percent would require 1353 tests per day, while 15 percent would require 764 tests per day,” Singh added.Evidence of Singh’s projections can found in more granular, daily data. “On June 19, when we tested 790 samples, the TPR was 18 percent. The previous day, with 686 samples tested, the positivity rate was 19 percent,” pointed out Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. However, on June 20, when only 590 tests were conducted, the positivity rate rose again, touching 33 percent.Dr Rajib Dasgupta, associate professor at the Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health, Jawaharlal Nehru University, who reviewed the district health bulletin data, agreed that there is a shortfall in the number of tests being conducted daily. However, he added a caveat to Singh’s projections. “Calculating the shortfall in testing is tricky, because you are making the assumption that the number of new daily positives will remain the same. It would be more correct to assume that the number of new positives being detected every day will increase, so these calculations are conservative estimates, at best,” Dasgupta cautioned.A senior surveillance officer in Haryana’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP), who requested anonymity, said this is indeed the case in Gurugram. “To say that we have been effective in controlling the spread, we would need to lower the TPR down to about 10 percent. This was the case in May, when we were seeing less deaths,” said the officer, cautioning that the district will likely see an increase in patients requiring intensive care, or succumbing to the disease, in coming weeks.To increase testing would mean casting a wider net, bringing unreported cases onto the health department’s radar, and enabling the contact tracing effort to catch up with some of those it hasn’t reached yet.Officials in the health department said that Gurugram’s testing capabilities are being upgraded to meet these projected capacities. “We have started RT-PCR tests in Civil Hospital. We are conducting about 50 tests per day there, but we are soon going to adopt automatic RNA extraction protocols which will increase the capacity to at least 200 to 300 new tests per day.” The surge in testing numbers on June 19 and 20, Yadav added, were a result of private labs accepting more samples, and not entirely due to an increase in government testing. With Gurugram’s first public testing facility expected to process at least 200 new samples, the district’s daily average should touch between 600 to 700 tests per day. This is about half the required number (to bring TPR down to 10 percent). Haryana’s additional chief secretary (health), Rajeev Arora, however, added that Gurugram would, by the end of the month, “Conduct close to 1000 tests per day.” Yadav, too, said, “Our target is 1000 tests a day in the foreseeable future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-undertesting-for-covid-19-say-experts/story-J0betevG6uX9GeHk76Uz4M.html

A decision in this regard is likely to taken in a day or two, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/committee-sends-report-on-capping-of-charges-to-state-govt-decision-soon/story-RKiFXZjy1nFUvkwNB7KqQM.html
22-06-2020||Delhi||Monsoon to hit Delhi by Tuesday, normal rainfall likely: IMD||Monsoon will hit the national capital in the next two days, as per the latest advisory by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Sunday.The IMD forecast said with the formation of a cyclonic circulation over West Bengal and the neighbouring areas on June 19 and 20, and its movement towards southwest Uttar Pradesh, because of which monsoon has already approached eastern UP, it will hit Delhi in the next two days.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the forecast shows that “full-fledged monsoon” will arrive in Delhi from June 23.“Delhi is expected to receive light rainfall on June 21 and June 22. From June 24, monsoon will arrive in full swing,” Srivastava said.He added that along with the national capital, monsoon will also arrive in northeast Rajasthan and the eastern parts of Haryana on the same dates. Usually, monsoon arrives in Delhi around June 29, but earlier this month the IMD had issued a forecast, announcing that this time the arrival date will be advanced to June 27. Scientists also said that the city is likely to receive “normal rainfall” this season.In 2019, Delhi witnessed the driest monsoon since 2014. IMD data showed that last year between June 30 and September 30, Delhi recorded 404.1mm rainfall, as opposed to the 30-year average of 648.9mm, a shortfall of nearly 38%.HT had reported that for the first time in IMD’s monsoon forecast history, IMD has also released new monsoon onset and withdrawal dates factoring in likely impacts of climate change that have led to a change in the way monsoon progresses over India.IMD’s new onset dates are based on analysis of monsoon data from 1961 to 2019 and withdrawal dates are based on data from 1971 to 2019 by scientists in IMD Pune.Govt cancels leave for PWD staff In view of the monsoon approaching the city, the Delhi government’s Public Works Department has directed that no field staff of its maintenance units will be allowed to take leave during this period without prior approval, PTI reported.The department has also directed inspection of all drainage pumps across the city, a move that is aimed at ensuring no waterlogging in the city during the monsoon period.There are around 1,250 kms of roads managed by the Delhi PWD in the national capital.During the monsoon, there are often complaints of waterlogging on roads which cause traffic jams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/monsoon-to-hit-delhi-by-tuesday-imd/story-VeIHmrVo5R1Ko3sOSgumYO.html
22-06-2020||Gurugram||Health workers trained on rapid antigen detection testing||A workshop was held on Sunday for health workers from across 10 districts of the state, including Gurugram, to make them aware about the Covid-19 rapid antigen detection test, which will soon be introduced. Around 30 people participated in the programme, which was organised by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) at the PWD guest house in the city. The state has decided to introduce the rapid antigen testing to boost the testing numbers as there has been a significant rise in the number of Covid-19 patients in Gurugram and Faridabad, particularly after the phased reopening of economic activities from May onwards. The health department has identified seven clusters in the city, which have reported half of the total cases in Gurugram. Accordingly, the rapid antigen testing would now be a prime focus in these areas, said officials.Health officials from the district, training officers, microbiologists and lab technicians participated in the workshop, which was held under the supervision of district civil surgeon Dr Virender Yadav. During the workshop, experts from ICMR, such as Dr Neeraj and Dr Nivedita, explained the nuances of standard and rapid antigen detection tests to the participants using a Power-Point presentation. Representatives from SD Biosensor, who were also present at the occasion, gave a demonstration of the testing kit, which shall be used to conduct Covid-19 tests on both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in the containment zones. Officials said that people in containment zones who are suffering from ailments related to lungs, heart, sugar , blood pressure and other similar medical conditions would be tested between fifth and 10th day. The positive aspect of the rapid antigen test is that the report of a patient can be given with 15-30 minutes, said officials. Those tested positive will further undergo the standard RT-PCR tests for a double confirmation.Dr Virender Yadav, civil surgeon, Gurugram said that officials from all ten districts have been trained as master trainers in the workshop, who can now train lab technicians in their respective districts. Health officials present in the workshop included Dr Aprajita, Dr Jaiprakash and district training officer, Dr Kiranmeet. “The workshop was organised to train health department staff to conduct rapid antigen tests properly as these would be conducted in containment zones to ensure that high-risk patients are tested timely,” said Virender Yadav,, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-workers-trained-on-rapid-antigen-detection-testing/story-twwo4Paf7RXx2GMEWbR6GM.html
22-06-2020||City||Phone tariff plans must be easy on mind and on pocket||New Delhi: A cell phone was never as important as today, in these times of Covid-19 pandemic. As the virus continues to wreak havoc and keep us away from our friends and relatives, we find solace in virtual meetings. We use the mobile phone to connect with our offices, for social networking, for ordering daily needs and making our payments .We also use the cell phone to talk to our doctors, keep in touch with those quarantined and those who are afflicted by the virus and are hospitalised. We keep track of Covid cases around us , we get our daily dose of news and entertainment, well, today the cell phone is central to our existence, our survival, more than ever before. . And this makes it imperative that we choose service plans that are best suited to our needs and give us best value for money.In other words, in these times of economic hardships, consumers have to make an informed choice and buy tariff plans that are cost-effective. But that’s easier said than done, given the complexity of the telecom tariffs today and the opacity surrounding them. Today, let alone compare the offers of different service providers, consumers find it difficult to even compare the various plans of the same service provider and buy what’s in their best interest. The innumerable combinations and permutations, time-bound offers, discounting, bundling, packaging, , add-ons, promotional offers, Special Tariff Vouchers, Combo Vouchers, well, who can make sense of all this and make an informed choice? It’s for this reason that consumers often experience a ‘bill shock’- an unexpected credit depletion in case of pre-paid consumers or an unanticipated high bill in case of post-paid subscribers. There are also many consumers who have chosen a wrong plan and are paying far more than what they ought to, given their usage pattern-again because of lack of clarity in the tariff plans offered.This is not peculiar to India and is a worldwide phonemenon and it’s for this reason that regulators around the world have enforced or in the process of enforcing full transparency in telecom tariffs, so as to protect the interests of consumers. Given the complexities of the present-day tariffs, many of them have also introduced tariff calculators to break down the complicated tariffs into a format and language that is easy to understand. The calculator may be provided by the service provider or the regulator . In UK, for example, the Office of Communication (Ofcom) accredits agencies that provide price comparison services, to ensure the integrity of the information flow. India too needs to enforce complete transparency, full disclosure and fair play in the way telecom tariffs are structured and sold. A common format for tariffs and a tariff calculator to help consumers compare prices of different service providers and choose the best option, is also a must. And this must be available in English as well as local languages and on mobile apps too. Similarly, there is need to ensure that all terms and conditions are fair to consumers and are fully disclosed along with offers and not somewhere else or in fine print. In fact, the imperative need arises from the fact that in India 92-95 per cent of consumers buy pre-paid plans (they are far more complex) and many of them come from economically weaker sections of the society with probably just elementary education. Last year, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India took cognizance of the vulnerability of telecom consumers vis-à-vis the changing landscape of telecom tariffs and proposed several measures, including a tariff calculator. Last Wednesday, the regulator held an online Open House on the topic and from media reports, the industry has not responded very positively to all the proposals.Telecom companies have a strong lobby and unless consumers write in large numbers to the regulator, demanding full enforcement of their proposal, consumers may well lose the game.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/phone-tariff-plans-must-be-easy-on-mind-and-on-pocket/story-3Nxy9T2Oq0vTYTz3RT24TI.html
22-06-2020||Gurugram||17 test +ve, booked for jumping quarantine and travelling||At least 17 people, who had been deputed by a private security agency at a major automobile company in IMT-Manesar, have been booked for allegedly violating quarantine regulations and travelling to other states without informing authorities. All the 17 men had tested Covid-19 positive earlier month and put in home quarantine.According to the police, the test results of all the 17 had come back as positive on June 17, following which the health authorities had put their names on a list and submitted the same to the company. Police said that a manager had informed the authorities that all the 17 staffers were asymptomatic and had been quarantined. Police said the automobile company had given the security contract to a third-party vendor, for whom all the 17 men worked.Police said on June 18, when a medical team reached IMT Manesar to check, they found that the 17 patients had left without any information.Hitesh Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Manesar, said that the workers of the automobile company were yet to resume their duties at IMT Manesar. “Some workers, who had returned to the city from other districts, got their tests done before joining work as a precautionary measure. Before the results of the tests could come in, some workers left the city. After we received a list of people who had tested positive, we contacted the concerned SHOs and officials from the districts they were in and ensured that they are put under quarantine. Health authorities have now been told to conduct their contact tracing,” said ACP.Arvind Kumar, station house officer (SHO), IMT Manesar police station, said that following the incident, a probe was initiated and it was found that the patients had gone to parts of Haryana and Rajasthan.“All the people, who had tested positive, were immediately traced and placed under quarantine at their respective primary health centres in Haryana and Rajasthan. On the complaint of the in-charge of the primary health centre in Bhangrola, Haryana, we have booked 17 people for violating quarantine rules and risking the spread of the infection,” said SHO Kumar.A case was registered against the accused persons under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of Indian Penal Code and section 51 (b) of the Disaster Management Act at IMT Manesar police station on Saturday, said police.On June 7, a vegetable vendor, who had tested positive for coronavirus disease and was quarantined at his home in a society in Sector 109, was booked for jumping quarantine after he had escaped to his hometown in Hisar. He was later traced by the authorities and isolated at a quarantine facility in Hisar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/17-test-ve-booked-for-jumping-quarantine-and-travelling/story-v1i8i7ILyJDxShxQeX1tqN.html
22-06-2020||Mumbai||Rapid action plan for Mumbai suburbs||Civic chief IS Chahal will on Monday launch a rapid action plan (RAP) for the city’s suburbs to check the rise in the number of cases in areas such as Mulund, Bhandup, Malad, Andheri, Borivli, Kandivli and Dahisar. The RAP has been modelled on the lines of the strategy that helped contain the spread in Worli and Dharavi. Additions have been made to these models for the suburbs to cater to residential buildings, as opposed to the slum settlements of Dharavi and congested settlements of Worli. As part of its RAP, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to start mobile fever clinics in ambulances in these areas. The mobile clinics will drive around through the day with a team of doctors, who will carry out door-to-door screening of residents, check for fever and other symptoms, co-morbidities, and collect swabs, if there is any suspected person. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, in charge of BMC’s health department, said, “We will use a pulse oximeter in the suburbs and a thermal gun to screen patients. A team of doctors will go from door to door.”A BMC official said, “We noticed the Worli and Dharavi models proved to be very effective. The first step is mobile fever clinics.” This will be followed by quarantining suspects, tracing contacts and quarantining them at home or in institutions.Dharavi’s model of forging public private partnerships with various people’s organisations and non-government organisations to tackle staff crunch will be replicated in the suburbs too. “We are also opening up all channels of communication with residents, such as elected public representatives, citizens’ organisations, and NGOs, so we can reach more people,” Kakani said, adding, “I toured the area on Saturday and listed four to five important measures based on my observation. The idea of having mobile fever clinics is approaching residents in their homes, instead of these residents walking out of their home and coming to a fever clinic. Residents can also contact BMC’s war room and a house call can be made to the caller for screening.”Dharavi screened a large number of persons in high risk groups – senior citizens and those with co-morbidity, and in fever clinics. After early detection, these were moved to institutional quarantine centres to reduce their contact with the community. Contact tracing and institutional quarantining of high-risk contacts was done on a large scale. Many new positive cases emerged in Dharavi from those people who were already in quarantine, and were already suspected. Four wards in the suburbs, of P-North, R-Central and R-North, and T, corresponding to areas of Malad, Borivli, Dahisar, and Mulund, respectively have a doubling rate of less than 20 days. The P/North ward of Malad has 3,615 cases, R/Central has 1961, R/North has 1,349 cases, and Mulund has 1,797 cases, as of Sunday. In comparison, some of the wards earlier known for high number of cases, such as the G-South ward of Worli has 3,107 cases and H-E ward of Bandra (East) has 3154 cases. These wards in the suburbs also have a high number of active cases, in comparison to their total closed cases (cases that have had an outcome of discharge or death). While 65% of the total cases in Malad are active, 58% of cases are active in Bhandup.Since June 1, Dharavi has consistently reported less than 30 cases per day, when it had reported as high as 94 cases in a single day in May. On Sunday, Dharavi recorded 12 new cases, and no deaths. While there are a total of 2,170 cases in Dharavi, 1,057 of these have been discharged. According to Press Information Bureau, Dharavi’s success model has been touted by government of India. A PIB release, said: “Being densely populated (2,27,136 persons/ sq. km), Dharavi had 491 cases in April 2020 with a 12% growth rate and a case doubling period of 18 days. The proactive measures adopted by BMC reduced the Covid-19 growth rate to 4.3% in May 2020 and further to 1.02% in June. These measures also ensured an improved case doubling time to 43 days in May 2020 and 78 days in June 2020.”BMC relied on “four Ts – Tracing, Tracking, Testing and Treating” to put Dharavi’s high-cases in check, and 47,500 people were covered by doctors and private clinics in house-to-house screening, 14,970 people were screened with the help of mobile vans, and 4,76,775 were surveyed by BMC’s health staff.Meanwhile, yet another BMC officer succumbed to Covid-19 on Sunday. He was an executive engineer with the storm water drainage (SWD) department.Also, addressing 134 complaints of overcharging by 26 private hospitals, BMC has managed to reduce the disputed amount by ₹23.42 lakh. The total amount that was disputed by all the 134 complaints was ₹1.61 crore which was brought down to 1.38 crore.Dismissing rumours of lockdown in Mumbai’s zone 7, which covers areas like Dahisar, Borivli and Kandivli, BMC clarified on Sunday that these are rumours and lockdown will only be implemented in containment zones. it mentioned that in cases where a sealed area has four separate adjoining roads, three will remain shut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rapid-action-plan-for-mumbai-suburbs/story-71WnJCYAKzHVbizYZ1g2FI.html
22-06-2020||Gurugram||Haryana sports minister urges people to stay off stadiums for keeping players safe||In light of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, the Haryana sports and youth affairs minister Sandeep Singh on Sunday urged people not to visit sports stadiums to ensure sportspersons remain safe from the virus spread and can practice and focus on becoming battle-ready for future competitions.Singh said sports stadiums should be exclusively accessed by athletes these days. “If people start visiting stadiums, the chances of the virus spreading will be high especially given Covid-19 cases are on the rise. Players need to practice, as is needed, but the general public can manage without visiting sports stadiums,” Singh told HT.Former Commonwealth Games gold-winning boxer, Akhil Kumar, who is currently also serving as the assistant commissioner of police, Gurugram, reiterated Singh’s views on only sportspersons visiting stadiums. “Without a proper space, a coach it is impossible for a player to carry on his/her rigorous practice and thus, the stadium becomes an integral part of a player’s training. However, the same stadium can also become a health hazard if too many people are visiting it,” said the Arjuna awardee. “It is imperative that only players should be using the stadium till the time the threat of Covid-19 has passed completely,” Kumar added.Gurugram city has only two stadia currently — the Nehru Stadium, in Civil Lines, and Tau Devi Lal Stadium, in Sector 38. Both the stadiums provide facilities for different sports leaving athletes effectively with only one stadium for all their needs.The sports minister said he is personally looking into the mental fitness and emotional well-being of players in the state and is ensuring they are regularly supervised by their coaches and are not missing their training sessions.Singh said many new sportspersons were anxiously looking forward to the competitions this year, but due to Covid-19 most of them have missed some opportunities to give their career a kick-start. “I am a hockey player myself and can relate to the sentiments of the athletes. I know how difficult it is for an athlete to not be on the field and remain out of practice. I have started making phone calls to players and am in regular touch with them to boost their energy,” he said.Major sports events have been postponed across the globe amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Singh, who is the former captain of the Indian national hockey team, said he is personally taking counseling sessions of athletes and is asking them to stay strong and work hard so that they are well prepared whenever sports events are announced. The initiative was taken after many sportspersons complained of suffering from depression amid the pandemic, he said.The minister, who is an MLA from Pehowa constituency, said the state government is providing all facilities at district levels so that players in the grassroots can practice and prepare themselves. “Stadiums are the first places where athletes play and think of taking sports as a career. Players need to be monitored regularly and we have asked the coaches to give them online sessions, and plan training schedule in such a manner that they are occupied for the day and are also counseled in short intervals,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-sports-minister-urges-people-to-stay-off-stadiums-for-keeping-players-safe/story-jpdf6WueW6pE7KLpFa5oAK.html

22-06-2020||Gurugram||MCG to collaborate with RWAs to carry out plantation drives in city||As the monsoon supposed to hit Delhi-NCR around June 25, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is working towards collaborating with the residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) of the city to launch plantation drives for a period of 12 days between June 27 and August 2, said officials on Sunday. For this purpose, MCG has stocked up more than 40,000 ornamental shrubs, medicinal plants, and plants and trees of indigenous varieties at its nurseries and has appealed to the RWAs across the city to join them in this drive.The MCG will be providing these plants to the RWAs free of cost and has also prepared a questionnaire that RWAs will be required to complete if they intend to be a part of the drive. The list of questions includes details like whether they need separate space for the plantation or can they plant saplings within their own complex, the quantity of saplings they require, and the weekend on which they want to conduct the drive. MCG officials said that they reached out to the RWAs on various WhatsApp groups where a link to the questionnaire was shared.The plantation drives will take place on all Saturdays and Sundays between June 27 and August 2 in collaboration with GuruJal — a water management initiative by the government. “We have been working in close tandem with the RWAs and have realised that including them in the plantation drives will be beneficial as they will take up the onus of maintaining the saplings. We have cultivated more than 40,000 saplings in our own nurseries and are also in the process of making arrangements with nurseries within Haryana and Uttarakhand to deliver 20,000 more if the need arises,” said Devender Bhadana, executive engineer, horticulture wing, MCG.As per MCG officials, more than 70 RWAs have volunteered to participate in the plantation drive.In May 2019, MCG had formed four nurseries across all its zones in the city, namely at Kadipur village, Sector 15 Part-1, the biodiversity park near Nathupur village, and Sector 46. At that time, MCG announced that they were aiming at cultivating at least two lakh saplings in their own nurseries for the sole purpose of planting them across the city in future plantation drives during the monsoon season.Last year, MCG had started cultivating around 35,000 saplings at their four nurseries that included saplings of fruits, such as papaya, pomegranate and guava, and trees, such as babool (gum arabic tree), peepal (sacred fig), gulmohar (royal poinciana), simal (bombax ceiba), and kachnar (bauhinia variegate). Around 10,000 more such saplings were cultivated earlier this year, said officials. Bhadana said that the MCG is also carrying out an audit of all the plants, shrubs, and trees that were planted during the previous drives.“We have records of all types and quantities of saplings that were planted during previous plantation drives. The on-site audit will help us assess the survival rate of such saplings so that we can focus on ensuring their growth. It will also help us to understand the survival rate of different types of trees, plants and shrubs in local conditions. Accordingly, we will plant more of those saplings that have a higher chance of survival,” said Bhadana.Bhadana further said that apart from the plantation drives, MCG is also looking to plant saplings at all its community centres, parks, and at the embankments of water bodies that are being revived.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-collaborate-with-rwas-to-carry-out-plantation-drives-in-city/story-RS8OoUyN218e3ZXQ1jeGOO.html
22-06-2020||Gurugram||Hry police to launch facial recognition app||The Haryana Police are collecting data about criminals while preparing to launch an Android application for facial recognition within a month in the state, they said.The police said the Digital Investigation Training and Analysis Centre (DITAC) team, which was set up in 2016 in Traffic Tower in Sushant Lok- 1 for digital investigation and training in a bid to enhance cyber policing and monitor social media content, is preparing a new tool and application for the state.The centre, comprising a Cyber Forensic Lab equipped with high-end tools, provides training in advanced digital investigations to police personnel from Haryana and other state police departments besides facilitating exclusive monitoring of social media content.The police said the DITAC is operated by a state police (crime branch of Haryana CID) team in collaboration with the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO).Anil Rao, the additional director general of police, Criminal Investigation Department (CID), said that they are in the process of launching the facial recognition system application. “This application will help the police personnel deployed on the frontlines to detect criminals. It will recognise human faces, typically by recording the unique ratios between an individual’s facial features, such as eyes, nose and mouth. The technology can be applied using facial features as biometric identifiers, that is, to identify individuals based on just a photo or video of their face,” he said. The application will analyse faces on a CCTV camera to catch a suspect in an investigation or day-to-day policing to combat crime on roads or public events. The technology will enable the police to scan crowds and pick out faces that match huge databases of suspects.Once the data is complete, police personnel across the state will download the application on their Android mobile phones and use it to find suspects involved in serious and heinous crimes. The application will analyse faces on CCTV cameras to catch a suspect. The technology will enable the police to scan crowds and pick out faces that match huge databases of suspects.More CCTV cameras will be installed across the cities in coming years, the police said.Rao said they are introducing new tools and technology to improve surveillance. “The facial recognition system will be connected to a network of cameras which will automatically track an individual as they move in and out of coverage, even if no other information is known about them,” he said.The DITAC will soon start training police personnel from each district, the police said, adding that they have already trained 1,292 Haryana Police personnel of various ranks and officials from other organisations such as IB, Army, NTRO, Assam Police, Goa Police, Punjab Police and Uttrakhand Police.Rao said DITAC deals with confidential matters concerning police investigations and several courses have been conducted such as monitoring social media, Cyber Forensics, Technology Acquisition of Smartphones, ATM and Netbanking fraud, Cyber Crime Investigation, Training on Technical Aspects in Investigation of Crime against Women and Children, Collection and Preservation of Digital/Electronic Evidences, Mobile and Disk Forensics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hry-police-to-launch-facial-recognition-app/story-LVRdhjdVqB54Gf3ApRzDBK.html

The nonagenarian’s strong willpower, active lifestyle, and healthy habits ensured that he walked the distance from the building’s main gate till the lift after returning home from the hospital.Manoharlal Gupta, who turned 91 on June 11, returned home to cheers from society members who had gathered in the compound to give him a warm welcome after he trounced the virus. They also showered flowers on him. Gupta lives with his daughter Seema Agrawal, 58, and grandson Akool Kumar, 28, in Destiny Heights building in Mulund (East). He had fallen sick with fever and cough during the first week of June. Doctor Pradip Shah, consultant and senior physician at Fortis Hospital advised him to go for a Covid test. “On June 9 the report confirmed that my father was positive for Covid-19. He was also diagnosed with typhoid. As he never went out after the lockdown, we don’t know how he got infected,” said Agrawal. “We also got tested but were not infected,” she added. “There were no beds available at any nearby hospitals, so we isolated him in the bedroom in our one-BHK flat till June 12. We were in touch with the doctor and monitored all the parameters as advised by Dr Shah,” said Gupta’s grandson, Kumar. Gupta even recorded videos about his health condition and shared them with Dr Shah.“As he had mild breathlessness, we admitted him to KJ Somaiya Hospital on June 13. He was in HDU (high dependency unit), and doctors took care of him very well,” said Kumar. “He has strong willpower. On the day he was admitted, he told me he would be coming home in two to three days and asked me to keep his 60ml peg ready,” added Agrawal. Gupta used to run a small factory in Kalyan and retired in 2010. The nonagenarian is the senior-most member of a group of 25 people aged above 55 years, who used to go for morning walks together before the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/91-year-old-beats-covid-returns-home-to-cheers-flowers/story-hoZFobt5h7mPLGHEWADlBL.html

We request you to let the Indian army decide on the best tactical response needed to counter our adversaries on our borders,” Bhundar said.Speaking about the rules of engagements about which the chief minister had made a comment on Saturday, Bhundur said the former should know that this was part of an agreement with China signed in 1996 and ratified in 2005 during the UPA tenure. “You seem to have overlooked this fact while talking about the need to change this policy and allow soldiers the freedom to use firearms,” he added, informing that the rules of engagement were changed yesterday itself and it was conveyed to China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-asks-amarinder-to-leave-soldiering-to-army/story-Pt85BaMWLUz3rxe1J1YKgN.html

22-06-2020||Chandigarh||Pending for 4 years, Punjab institutes yet to get ₹1,853 cr in post-matric scholarship||The much-hyped centrally sponsored post-matric scholarship scheme for the scheduled caste (SC) students seems to be in the doldrums as funds to the tune of ₹1,853 crore have not been released for the past four years to various educational institutions in Punjab.It was in the 2015-16 academic session when the colleges and universities in the state, both public and private, were last paid the funds under the scheme. Now, the scholarship has turned into a financial burden for these institutions due to the pendency that was ₹415 crore in 2016-17, ₹538 in 2017-18, ₹437 crore in 2018-19 and ₹450 crore in 2019-20.In Punjab, over 2.5 lakh students belonging to the schedule castes are the direct beneficiaries of the scheme.Under the scheme, the scholarship (mainly as academic fee waiver) is paid to the students whose parents and guardians’ annual income from all sources does not exceed ₹2.5 lakh.“As per the terms and conditions, the Punjab government was to take over the central scheme and had to bear the cost from 2016 onwards. Before 2016, the scheme was 90% financially sponsored by the Centre. Thereafter, the state government failed to take over the scheme and the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment stalled the funding,” an official said.Anshu Kataria, president, Punjab Unaided Colleges Association (PUCA), said the amount has been stuck in the correspondences between state and central government departments and they have failed to resolve the issue so far.“We came to know that the funds worth ₹309 crore were released to the state in March but they have not been distributed to the institutions yet as a result of which they are under huge financial stress. Also, there is no clarity on giving admissions to students under the scheme in the coming 2020-21 academic year,” he said.Punjabi University, Patiala, registrar Prof Manjit Singh Nijjar said they have repeatedly written to the state government to clear their dues to the tune of ₹46 crore under the scheme. “We have not received any funds in the past four years,” he added.Kirpa Shankar Saroj, additional chief secretary (social justice, empowerment and minorities) said talks are on with the Centre to release the pending arrears under the scheme. “It is not possible for the state government to clear arrears from its own resources. It is primarily a central scheme and therefore we have taken up the issue with the department concerned for settlement of payments,” he said.As far as adopting the scheme is concerned, the additional chief secretary said their department has prepared a blueprint to come up with a similar plan.BOXXX:SESSION-WISE PENDENCY₹415 crore: 2016-17₹538 crore: 2017-18₹437 crore: 2018-19₹450 crore: 2019-20THE BENEFICIARIESOver 2.5 lakh students belonging to schedule castes are beneficiaries of the scheme in PunjabUnder the scheme, the scholarship (mainly as academic fee waiver) is paid to the students whose parents and guardians’ annual income from all sources does not exceed ₹2.5 lakh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pending-for-4-years-punjab-institutes-yet-to-get-1-853-cr-in-post-matric-scholarship/story-dEddUrWj3uUHUPVaAJArHL.html

On behalf of the state government, the Amritsar district administration had deputed the Ajnala SDM to acquire the land.Authorities are still negotiating the rate with owner of around 30 acres of selected land. “The owner demands around ₹90 lakh per acre, which is too high. So, we have sent a report of our negotiations with the owner to higher authorities for taking a decision,” Ajnala SDM Deepak Bhatia said.Meanwhile, land owner Pargat Singh said, “Officials of state and Central governments are making rounds for the last two-three years. I don’t want to sell my land as a portion has already been purchased by the BSF for residential flats. I am a farmer and want to keep the rest for myself.”“I have suggested an alternative land which is situated at Gharinda village and land owners are interested. The government will get land there at negotiable price,” he said.Amritsar Vikas Manch, an NGO, said, “Since 2015, the year in which the institute was cleared by the then central finance minister late Arun Jaitley, the efficiency of the state government is not satisfactory, as the Punjab government could not provide land to ICAR.”Blurb:Project was being seen as crucial for crop diversification and uplifting status of Punjab’s border farmers||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/five-yrs-on-punjab-govt-fails-to-acquire-land-for-icar-s-horticulture-institute/story-HryXOtzOhVwmliebO1yASJ.html
22-06-2020||Mumbai||Body bag ‘scam’: BMC cancels deal, to float new tender||Following allegations of a ‘scam’ in procurement of body bags, which are used to wrap dead bodies, saying that the bags were procured at more than five times the actual cost, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has cancelled the contract of the procurement and will refloat the tender for the same. The civic body also said that the price was less than what was stated on Central health ministry’s website. The controversy over body bags erupted after some Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders as well as social activist Anjali Damania tweeted documents of the procurement by BMC.On Thursday, Damania tweeted a document saying BMC has given a contract of procuring body bags to Aurangabad-based Vedant Innotech Private limited for ₹6,719 per bag wherein the civic body was to procure nearly 3,000 body bags. She alleged the actual cost of body bags is between ₹250 and ₹1,200 and added that the selected firm does not have any experience in manufacturing body bags . She further said that the firm is into casting metals.Damania said, “There is a huge scam in every single procurement by BMC. This particular procurement of body bags makes me sick. How can they even think of making money from dead bodies? Also, if the BJP knew about it and had all the documents, why didn’t they hold a press conference.”Satish Kalyankar, managing director of the firm, said, “We are giving specialised body bags that have unique qualities and is anti-viral. We are giving protective equipments to the ones handling these bodies along with the bag. Also, amid shortage of labour and expensive raw material, we still have quoted much below our actual price.”Commenting on the allegations, additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said, “Of all the bidders, the one selected was purely on the basis of the quality as we needed leak proof bags which others failed to furnish. The bags were thoroughly checked by a team of nine medical experts and then given a go ahead. This was the third time we had floated the tenders since we were looking for the right quality of bags.” Velrasu added that fresh tenders for the bags would be floated soon.However, a war for credit broke out after BJP leaders claimed they had raised this issue of procurement before Damania did. BJP’s Mumbai unit secretary Vivekanand Gupta said, “BMC is making money out of dead bodies. The guilty should face strict action in this case. I was the first one to raise this complaint with documents. I have also shared the Twitter timelines of my tweets.”BMC, in a press statement, said tenders were floated thrice and they only got a response on the third one on May 2.

He has been closely involved in the listing of ‘masala bonds’ by Indian institutions on the London stock market in recent years.“Nikhil is the outstanding candidate for the position of chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, and I am delighted that he has agreed to take up the role,” said Sunak.“We have conducted a thorough, worldwide search for this crucial appointment and, through his wide-ranging experiences across financial services, I am confident that Nikhil will bring the ambitious vision and leadership this organisation demands,” he added.The FCA is the conduct regulator for the UK’s financial markets, over 59,000 financial services firms, and the prudential supervisor for 49,000 firms, setting specific standards for 19,000 firms.It has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.FCA chair Charles Randell said: “Nikhil has been closely involved in guiding the FCA’s development through his roles on our Practitioner Panel and Markets Practitioner Panel, and brings both private sector management skills and experience of domestic and international regulatory policymaking”.Rathi added: “I am honoured…In the years ahead, we will create together an even more diverse organisation, supporting the recovery with a special focus on vulnerable consumers, embracing new technology, playing our part in tackling climate change, enforcing high standards and ensuring the UK is a thought leader in international regulatory discussions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-appoints-indian-origin-ceo-as-uk-financial-watchdog/story-LB0LadDiwioGDDuOw9T4MJ.html
22-06-2020||World||Global coronavirus cases top 9 million; outbreak surges in Brazil, India||Global cases of the novel coronavirus surpassed 9 million on Monday, as Brazil and India grappled with a surge in infections, and the United States, China and other hard-hit countries reported new outbreaks, according to a Reuters tally.The first case was reported in China in early January and it took until mid-May to reach 4.5 million cases. It has taken just five weeks to double to 9 million cases, the tally shows. The United States leads the world with the highest number of infections, at about 2.2 million or 25% of all reported cases. The tally shows the disease is spreading fastest in Latin America, which now accounts for 23% of all cases. Brazil has the second most cases behind the United States, and India is on track to overtake Russia as the third most affected country by cases.The number of global infections continues to rise at a rate of around 1%-2% a day since the beginning of June, even as many countries are taking steps to ease lockdown measures. On Friday, global cases rose by a record 176,000 in a day, according to the tally, when Brazil reported over 54,000 cases in a single day, the most of any country throughout the pandemic. Global deaths stand at over 464,000 and have doubled in seven weeks. The crisis is deepening in Brazil where the death toll is over 50,000, widespread testing is absent, and the country is still without a permanent health minister.In the United States, which has about 120,000 deaths, cases are rising again after declining for more than a month and wearing a mask is not mandatory in most states. China is also trying to contain a fresh outbreak in Beijing, where it asserts it has a capacity to test over 1 million people a day in the city alone. On its best day, the United States tested over 594,000 people nationwide but often tests fewer than half a million a day.Even in Germany, a country seen as successful in curbing the virus and limiting deaths, infection rates are rising above the level needed for long-term containment. Australia is also battling a spike in cases in Victoria where other states have seen few, if any, new cases in weeks.Still there are bright spots such as Spain reopening its borders, death rates plunging in the former hot spot of Italy, and Greece welcoming a return of foreign tourists. Just under half of all reported cases have recovered, though the number is likely higher as some countries do not report the statistic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-coronavirus-cases-top-9-million-outbreak-surges-in-brazil-india/story-2eJYO49Lby4jXZKpMCivcI.html
22-06-2020||World||Stop ‘irresponsible remarks’ on spy case: China to Canada’s Justin Trudeau||China told Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday to “stop making irresponsible remarks” after he said Beijing’s decision to charge two Canadians with spying was linked to his country’s arrest of a Chinese tech executive.The spying charges are “completely different” from the case of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, a foreign ministry spokesman said. Meng was arrested on US charges connected to possible violations of trade sanctions on Iran.Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were detained in what was widely seen as an attempt to Canada after Meng’s December 2018 arrest in Vancouver. Charges against them were announced Friday after a Canadian judge ruled Meng’s extradition case can proceed to its next stage, moving her closer to being handed over to American authorities.Trudeau, speaking to reporters in Ottawa, said Chinese authorities “directly linked” the cases of Kovrig and Spavor with Meng. He called on Beijing to end their “arbitrary detention.” “There is no such thing as arbitrary detention,” said the ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian.“China urges the relevant Canadian leader to earnestly respect the spirit of the rule of law, respect China’s judicial sovereignty and stop making irresponsible remarks,” Zhao said.Meng, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Ltd. and the daughter of its founder, is accused of lying to banks in Hong Kong about Huawei’s dealings with Iran in possible violation of US sanctions.Meng’s case is a “seriously political incident” and part of US efforts to “suppress Chinese high-tech enterprises and Huawei,” Zhao said. He said Canada “played the role of an accomplice.” “We strongly urge Canada to correct its mistakes as soon as possible, immediately release Meng Wanzhou and ensure her safe return to home,” said Zhao.Meng is living in a mansion she owns in Vancouver, where she reportedly is working on a graduate degree. Kovrig and Spavor are being held at an undisclosed location and have been denied access to lawyers or family members.China has also sentenced two other Canadians to death and suspended imports of Canadian canola.Zhao said visits by foreign diplomats to prisoners were suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stop-irresponsible-remarks-on-spy-case-china-to-canada-s-justin-trudeau/story-g96KqZgdWrEzM1X5lCUj9I.html
22-06-2020||World||Iran’s currency reaches lowest value ever against dollar||Iran’s currency on Monday dropped to its lowest value ever against the dollar and officials warned Iranian exporters to bring their foreign earnings home from abroad.Money exchange shops briefly traded the Iranian rial 200,000 for a dollar and later in the day, the currency was valued at 198,000 rials against the dollar. The lows were a new record after the rial on Saturday traded at 190,000 for the dollar.The plunge of the rial comes amid severe US sanctions imposed on Tehran. Iran’s Senior Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri on Monday urged Iranian exporters to bring home their earnings from abroad. Last week, Jahangiri said Iran’s oil revenues have plummeted to $8 billion from $100 billion in 2011.The country’s commerce ministry warned that it would revoke export licenses for those who fail to comply and bring the hard currency home while Iran’s central bank said on Sunday that it would publish the names of the violators.Iranian companies reportedly export non-oil products in the value of more than 40 billion dollars a year, and officials say about half of that money stays abroad.The rial has tumbled from a rate of 32,000 rials to $1 at the time of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. The currency unexpectedly rallied for some time after President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the US from the nuclear deal and reimpose crippling trade sanctions on Iran more than two years ago.The sanctions have caused Iran’s oil exports, the country’s main source of income, to fall sharply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-s-currency-reaches-lowest-value-ever-against-dollar/story-UP8RMFLbMyHMGrQ1LpNp7J.html

The IS in Afghanistan is headquartered in eastern Nangarhar province.According to a statement from the attorney general’s office, the car was on the way to office when it was targeted. The gunmen fled the scene, the police said. Faramarz said an investigation was underway.In early June, IS claimed responsibility of a bomb explosion in a mosque in Kabul that killed two people, including the prayer leader. Eight worshipers were wounded.A week later, another prayer leader and three worshipers were killed in a bomb explosion inside another mosque in Kabul. Eight people were wounded in that attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunmen-hit-car-in-kabul-killing-5-including-2-prosecutors/story-0R9nRFW9zzZZVEHbtBq4oK.html

Germany’s DAX slid 0.7% to 12,250, with payments company Wirecard diving almost 40% after it said that some $2 billion in missing funds in an accounting scandal probably don’t exist.US markets appeared set to edge up, with futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow up 0.6% and 0.5%.Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.2% to 22,437.27, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong sank 0.5% to 24,515.23. The Kospi in South Korea slipped 0.7% to 2,126.73.The Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% lower to 2,965.27, while India’s Sensex jumped 0.9%. Sydney’s S&P/ASX 200 was almost unchanged at 5,944.50, supported by a report that consumer spending has rebounded more quickly from the pandemic shock than expected, analysts said.Investors appear cautious with prices already relatively high and “out of whack” with earnings expectations, Mizuho Bank said in a commentary. “And so, investors may be increasingly nervous about being caught on the wrong side of ‘irrational exuberance,’ “ it said.On top of that, the “sheer speed and amplitude of the equity market rebound ... from the depths of the March sell-off may also counsel some patience rather than haste; prudently pausing to take profits for the quarter,” it said.The World Health Organization on Sunday reported the largest single-day increase in coronavirus cases by its count, at more than 183,000 new cases in the previous 24 hours. The UN health agency said on Sunday that Brazil led the way with 54,771 cases and the US next at 36,617. India confirmed 15,400 new cases.The United States also reported more than 30,000 new coronavirus cases on Friday and Saturday, with the daily totals their highest since May 1. A large share of the cases are in the South, West and Midwest, where hospitals in some areas are becoming overwhelmed.Case numbers in South Korea and China have appeared to be moderating after recent outbreaks centered in their capitals.Great uncertainty remains over whether countries that have been relaxing pandemic-fighting restrictions on travel and business might end up re-imposing broader controls that would slow a recovery from the worst global downturn since the Great Depression in the 1930s.“The extent to which the Covid-19 pandemic slows economic recovery could increasingly come into focus. These shifting dynamics are always challenging to equate,” Stephen Innes of AxiCorp said in a commentary.Even if widespread stay-at-home orders don’t happen, the fear is that scared shoppers may still shy away from stores and businesses may pull back on their own spending.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was steady Monday at 0.70% after climbing as high as 0.74% on Friday. It tends to move with investors’ expectations for the economy and inflation.A barrel of US crude oil for delivery in July fell 25 cents to $39.50 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It rose 2.3% to settle at $39.75 on Friday. Brent crude, the international standard, shed 18 cents to $42.01 per barrel.In currency trading, the dollar was at 106.93 Japanese yen, up from 106.87 on Friday.

22-06-2020||World||After face-off with India, China embroiled in maritime dispute with Japan||Japan has begun the legal process of complete integration of an island chain over which it has a dispute with China. The development came just a week after the violent clash between Indian and Chinese troops over the Line of Actual Control. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in that clash in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley. The Ishigaki city council in Japan’s Okinawa prefecture passed a bill to change the name of an administrative area covering the disputed uninhabited island chain to Tonoshiro Senkaku from Tonoshiro, starting October 1, according to media reports. The island group lies 1,931 km southwest of Tokyo. The Senkakus island chain, which China calls Diaoyus, has been administered by Japan since 1972, but its legal status has remained disputed until now.Calling the islands its “inherent territories”, China on Monday warned Tokyo against any change in the status quo.Beijing urged Japan to “abide by the spirit of the four-principle consensus, avoid creating new incidents on the Diaoyu Islands issue, and take practical actions to maintain the stability of the East China Sea situation”.However, the Japanese city council said that the bill was necessary to “improve the efficiency of administrative procedures”.Since April, Chinese ships had been spotted by the Japanese coast guard, in the waters close to the Senakakus. The number of Chinese ships have only increased in the last few weeks with four of them sailing in the area even on the day when the bill was passed by the city council, reports news agency IANS. Japan’s cabinet secretary last week reiterated that the Senkakus are under Tokyo’s control and “unquestionably” their territory historically and under international law. “It is extremely serious that these activities continue. “We will respond to the Chinese side firmly and calmly,” he had warned, the IANS report added.The Senkakus island chain dispute with Japan is not the only territorial and maritime dispute that China has long had with many of its neighbours. It has island and maritime border disputes with Taiwan, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam in the South China Sea and its extension. The disputes include islands, reefs, banks and other features in the South China Sea including Spratly Islands (with Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan), Paracel Islands (Vietnam), Scarborough Shoal (Philippines), and Gulf of Tonkin (Vietnam).Last week, China’s air force approached Taiwan on Friday for the fourth time in four days, Taiwan’s military said, as China steps up manoeuvres near the island that Beijing claims as its own territory. The Chinese air force was given a verbal warning to leave, and Taiwanese jets “responded”, Taiwan’s air force said, without giving further details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-face-off-with-india-china-embroiled-in-maritime-dispute-with-japan/story-aPSWNmYndKkcpcuf4tYDGL.html
22-06-2020||World||Covid-19: New no-swab, saliva test pilot project begins in UK||Britain’s health officials on Monday began a month-long, no-swab test pilot project to detect coronavirus in homes in Southampton that involves participants putting their saliva into a sample pot, with results delivered in 48 hours.Test kits are being first delivered to doctors, other essential key workers, employees of the University of Southampton and members of their households. Samples will be collected safely from homes by university staff or returned to an agreed location on a weekly basis.Health secretary Matt Hancock said, “Saliva testing could potentially make it even easier for people to take coronavirus tests at home, without having to use swabs. This trial will also help us learn if routine, at-home testing could pick up cases of the virus earlier”.The officials said the saliva test will be significant to increasing testing capacity and accessibility as it does not require the use of a swab, which some people find uncomfortable. The test has already been shown to be highly promising; the pilot is undertaking further validation against polymerase chain reaction nasal swabs, they added.Weekly testing as part of the pilot is expected to help identify coronavirus cases early, including for those with no or minor symptoms, meaning those who test positive can isolate within their households.Debbie Chase of Southampton city council said: “We will initially invite Southampton’s 800-strong GP (general practitioner) practice workforce and their households to take part, followed by some other essential key workers and some University of Southampton staff and students as we evaluate the logistics needed for regular testing of large population groups”.Keith Godfrey of the University of Southampton added: “The health, social and economic impacts of lockdown cannot be underestimated. Through this initiative we believe we can contribute to safely restoring economic activity within the city and region during national relaxation measures, whilst enabling people to regain their lives, work and education”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-new-no-swab-saliva-test-pilot-project-begins-in-uk/story-kk0PPusHWSZy9YRR1YCBiM.html
22-06-2020||World||Europe braces for second covid-19 wave as authorities push for medical workers hiring||Europeans are enjoying the gradual easing of coronavirus lockdown measures, but in hospitals they are already preparing for the next wave of infections.Some intensive care specialists are trying to hire more permanent staff. Others want to create a reservist “army” of medical professionals ready to be deployed wherever needed to work in wards with seriously ill patients. European countries have been giving medics crash courses in how to deal with Covid-19 patients, and are now looking at ways to retrain staff to avoid shortages of key workers if there is a second wave of the novel coronavirus.“We need a healthcare army,” said Maurizio Cecconi, president-elect of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), which brings together medics from around the world who work in wards with extremely ill patients.Cecconi, who heads the intensive care department at the Humanitas hospital in Milan, says medical staff need to be more flexible in the work they do, and more mobile.“If there is another big wave, we should be prepared to deploy doctors and nurses from nearby regions within Italy. This did not happen a lot in the first wave,” he told Reuters.Many countries were caught unprepared by the Covid-19 pandemic in March and April, and hastily retrained medics to work with patients with severe cases of the disease, to ramp up numbers and replace those who fell sick.Some sent medical students and retired doctors to help out in intensive care wards as hospital staff were overwhelmed. Those worst-hit by the pandemic had to provide more beds and essential equipment for acute care units, and some built new hospitals.But problems and shortages persist. Italy, for example, may need to boost by 50% the number of anaesthetists, resuscitation experts and other medics it has working in intensive care, according to the Italian society of intensive care SIAARTI. Crash coursesAcross Europe, hospitals have been re-training surgeons, cardiologists, internal medicine physicians and nurses from other departments, and have moved them to intensive care units when needed. Many have attended crash courses on how to handle Covid-19 patients, said Jozef Kesecioglu, president of ESICM and head of intensive care at the University Medical Center of Utrecht, in the Netherlands.“We gave them jobs with less responsibility, such as washing patients, turning patients around, checking the lungs or looking at scans,” he told Reuters.Intensive care specialists had continued to do the most delicate work, such as handling tubes in patients’ throats or adjusting mechanical ventilation, Kesecioglu said.He plans to call back the same people to offer them more training. Under normal circumstances, intensive care workers undergo years of training but he said: “We should not wait until the new wave comes, we should give them regular training.” The Netherlands is trying to recruit more skilled workers and hopes to narrow structural gaps in the intensive care workforce, said Rotterdam’s Erasmus Medical Centre, one of the largest university hospitals in Europe. SIAARTI says medical students who specialise in intensive care medicine should be fully integrated into wards for the last two years of their five-year training, and has recommended financial incentives be offered to attract more students. The European Commission, the European Union’s executive, funded cross-border transfers of medical staff to the most affected countries at the height of the coronavirus crisis.In April, teams of “flying doctors” were sent from Norway and Romania to Italy.But the experiment has failed to gather much support, and Cecconi said moving doctors from one country to another “should be an option but not the first option,” as language barriers may make them less effective. Some patients were also moved around to receive treatment. France transferred some to less-affected regions of the country and sent others to Germany, which also took in Covid-19 patients from Italy.But Cecconi warned of transportation risks and logistical complications. “Often our patients are very sick,” he said. “I’d rather have skilled people who know how to work in my environment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fearing-second-covid-19-wave-europe-aims-to-train-army-of-medics/story-4zljhPlgJT0znsUBunXhuL.html
22-06-2020||World||Vladimir Putin signals for first time he may seek to extend rule in 2024||Vladimir Putin said he’ll consider running for a fifth presidential term in 2024, arguing that the hunt for any successor risks paralyzing Russia’s government as the next election nears.“I don’t rule out such a possibility,” if the necessary amendment to the constitution is approved, Putin said in a Rossiya 1 television documentary broadcast late Sunday. “I haven’t made up my mind yet.”On July 1, Russians will vote on the most sweeping changes to the nation’s constitution since it was adopted almost 30 years ago. One of the amendments would allow Putin, 67, to reset his term limit to zero even though he’s already served four, and to helm the country for two more six-year terms when his current one expires in 2024. In power since 2000, Putin is already the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin.Without that amendment, “I can tell you from my own experience that in about two years, instead of the regular rhythmic work on many levels of government, you’d have eyes shifting around hunting for possible successors,” Putin said. “It’s necessary to work, not look for successors.”A top ally of the Russian president, Andrei Klishas, a senior lawmaker who helped to steer the constitutional overhaul, said that Russians should stop thinking about who will rule after Putin leaves office.“They should get used to the idea that everything will remain the same, that the president can be re-elected if people support these changes to the Constitution,” Klishas said in an interview with RBC newspaper published Monday. “This amendment allows us to put aside the issue of successors, transfer of power and so on.”Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, on Monday denied the president’s comment meant the political system he built was incapable of functioning in the event of a change of leadership. But he said speculation over potential successors “is a characteristic of our national bureaucracy.”For the moment, Putin’s main goal is to avoid becoming a “lame duck” in the final years of his current mandate, said Leonid Davydov, a political analyst at the Foundation for Civil Society Development in Moscow. But there is “little doubt” that the Russian president will choose to run again for election, he said.In the same state-TV interview Sunday, Putin also harshly criticized neighbouring states for absorbing “traditional Russian historic territories” on independence in 1991 that they had acquired during the existence of the Soviet Union.These states should have “left with what they arrived, rather than taking with them presents from the Russian people,” he said.Russia, which annexed Crimea in 2014 from Ukraine, restoring control over the peninsula that had been Russian until 1954, doesn’t have any territorial claims on its neighbors, Peskov told reporters Monday on a conference call, in response to a question about this comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vladimir-putin-signals-for-first-time-he-may-seek-to-extend-rule-in-2024/story-KEPUA7ZyDtY2fZdHZK7q1M.html

Test results will be received within 48 hours, the government said.The pilot will be jointly led by Southampton City Council, the University of Southampton, and the state-run health service, alongside a wider network of public services in Hampshire.The government said it was also exploring the potential of other no-swab saliva based coronavirus tests with companies including Chronomics, Avacta, MAP Science and Oxford Nanoimaging (ONI). It said it was also working with suppliers including DNA Genotek, International Scientific Supplies Ltd, Isohelix and other leading manufacturers, to develop bespoke saliva collection kits and scale up manufacturing for products that can be used with existing PCR tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-starts-trial-of-no-swab-saliva-test-for-covid-19/story-GvdPcOAl6mdljbRlagkIPN.html

He said the basic reproduction number of virus carriers, which measures the number of infections caused by an individual, has reached nearly 1.8 for the period between April 30 and June 11. Any number above 1 indicates a growing epidemic.In a separate briefing, Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, acknowledged that the country was now going through a second wave of the virus, following a surge in late February and March centered around the southeastern city of Daegu.The country has been reporting around 40 to 50 new cases per day since late May, mostly from the Seoul metropolitan area, where about half of South Korea’s 51 million people live.South Korea was reported around 500 new case per day in early March but managed to control the outbreak with an active testing and contact tracing campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fears-south-korea-losing-control-over-second-coronavirus-wave/story-AbxozK6y0WjwsdLsv7L5vI.html

He was beautiful, intelligent, honest and fun. He was the best son, brother, uncle and partner you could wish for. We are thankful for the memories he gave us all. We will never forget him and he will live in our hearts forever.”US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, said: “I offer my deepest condolences to the families of those killed in the attack on June 20. To our great sorrow, this includes an American citizen. Our thoughts are with all those affected. We condemn the attack absolutely and have offered our assistance to British law enforcement”.Khairi Saadallah, 25, of Libyan origin, who was arrested under terrorism laws, was on the radar of British intelligence services in mid-2019, but the case was dropped since no immediate threat was identified.Saadallah was reportedly granted asylum in the UK and was under investigation as a person who may travel abroad for extremist reasons, but no immediate threat was identified. Some reports said he may have mental health issues.The UK’s terrorism threat level was lowered in November 2019 from ‘severe’ to ‘substantial’, which means an attack is likely. Security minister James Brokenshire said it was unlikely to be changed after the Reading attack.He said: “What I would say is that the police and security services obviously deal with thousands of leads, that they have difficult challenges that they have in terms of prioritisation of resource, but I can assure that if there are lessons to be learned, there are policies that needs to be changed, if we need to do things differently, absolutely that is what we will do”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/school-teacher-us-citizen-among-3-stabbed-to-death-in-uk-terror-attack/story-ubZ7MHpVu8JXZuvB92LAfO.html
22-06-2020||World||China’s annual dog-meat fair opens; activists hope for last time||China’s notorious dog-meat festival has opened in defiance of a government campaign to improve animal welfare and reduce risks to health highlighted by the novel coronavirus outbreak, but activists are hopeful its days are numbered.The annual 10-day festival in the southwestern city of Yulin usually attracts thousands of visitors, many of whom buy dogs for the pot that are on display in cramped cages, but campaigners said the numbers this year have dwindled. The government is drawing up new laws to prohibit the wildlife trade and protect pets, and campaigners are hoping that this year will be the last time the festival is held.“I do hope Yulin will change not only for the sake of the animals but also for the health and safety of its people,” said Peter Li, China policy specialist with the Humane Society International, an animal rights group.“Allowing mass gatherings to trade in and consume dog meat in crowded markets and restaurants in the name of a festival poses a significant public health risk,” he said.The coronavirus, which is believed to have originated in horseshoe bats before crossing into humans in a market in the city of Wuhan, has forced China to reassess its relationship with animals, and it has vowed to ban the wildlife trade. In April, Shenzhen became the first city in China to ban the consumption of dogs, with others expected to follow. The agriculture ministry also decided to classify dogs as pets rather than livestock, though it remains unclear how the reclassification will affect Yulin’s trade. Zhang Qianqian, an animal rights activist who was in Yulin on Saturday, said it was only a matter of time before the dog-meat festival was banned. “From what we understand from our conversations with meat sellers, leaders have said the consumption of dog meat won’t be allowed in future,” she said. “But banning dog-meat consumption is going to be hard and will take some time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-annual-dog-meat-fair-opens-activists-hope-for-last-time/story-liCnNsKjBYnyTgWrDHvaKI.html
22-06-2020||World||Jailed UK-Iranian pleads with PM Johnson to help inmates||The sound is a little fuzzy but Anoosheh Ashoori’s voice does not falter as he delivers his message to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson from inside Iran’s Evin jail.“We are in desperate need of your help,” the retired engineer, who holds British and Iranian passports, says in a recording made on the phone to his wife in London.During the three years since his arrest in Tehran, he has endured interrogations and stints in solitary that made him try to end his life, but the 66-year-old’s biggest fear now is coronavirus.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“I am appealing to you to take action and get me and my fellow British citizens out of Evin prison, where the threat of Covid-19 is as strong as ever,” he urged Johnson, in the recording shared with AFP.“My fear is that we have been forgotten by the British government.”Ashoori was visiting his mother in Tehran in August 2017 when he was arrested, accused of spying for Israel and later jailed for 10 years, his family says.Dual nationals from various countries have been detained in Iran, in what campaigners and the British government say is a policy of hostage-taking aimed at pressuring the West.In an interview in the garden of Ashoori’s southeast London home, his wife, Sherry Izadi, dismisses the charges against him as “preposterous” and says his trial only lasted an hour.The father-of-two had never been involved in politics, she said, telling AFP: “We’re very ordinary -- we’re extremely unimportant.”And yet, “he went out one day to do some shopping and he never came back”.Nothing to lose’She said initially, long interrogations and time spent in solitary confinement threatened to break her husband, who staged a 17-day hunger strike and tried to kill himself.Since his conviction he has been better, keeping fit and joining impromptu lessons with fellow inmates, but the family fears for the future.“It would be unimaginable for someone innocent to stay somewhere for 10 years for something he’s never done,” she says.Some foreign prisoners were given temporary release at the start of the coronavirus outbreak, including British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, whose husband has campaigned relentlessly for her freedom.But Ashoori remains in jail and the family are increasingly impatient with the lack of progress made by the British government.Izadi met Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab in October but says “nothing has come of it”.The Foreign Office advised them not to talk to the media while it tried the diplomatic route, but Ashoori has asked them to release his statements, which form part of a diary he is recording in daily calls with his wife.“He says he’s got nothing to lose,” his daughter Elika, 33, told AFP.Diplomatic pawns The Foreign Office has recorded around a dozen incidents of people with British passports being arrested in Iran since 2015, and in May last year it advised dual British-Iranian nationals not to visit.Former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt in December 2018 accused Tehran of using foreign passport holders as “pawns of diplomatic leverage” -- a claim Iran strongly denies.Supporters of Ashoori and Zaghari-Ratcliffe believe their cases are linked to a long-running legal battle over £400 million ($500 million) Iran paid to Britain in the 1970s for tanks that were never delivered.But campaigners have also cried foul over the detention of dual nationals from other countries, including French-Iranian academic Fariba Adelkhah.In another message sent from prison, Ashoori says one of his fellow inmates witnessed Adelkhah being brought into jail.She was “kicked and dragged on the floor by her hair, and was showered with curses and other physical and verbal abuse” by secret police guards, he said.Due judicial process A Foreign Office spokesman said the fate of the dual nationals held in Iran was “a priority” and raised with Tehran at the highest levels of government.“We strongly urge Iran to reunite British-Iranian dual national Mr Ashoori with his family,” a spokesman said.But the Iranian embassy in London rejected any claims of politically motivated charges.Ashoori had been convicted of “national security-related crimes by the Iranian judiciary in a due judicial process in which Mr. Ashoori had the right and opportunity to defend himself,” it said in a statement to AFP.“Iranian authorities ensures proper access to medical services for prisoners inside or outside prisons based on regular checks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jailed-uk-iranian-pleads-with-pm-johnson-to-help-inmates/story-nBFdZ5oHd48ecUqQPKVL6L.html
22-06-2020||World||Coronavirus outbreak could spin ‘out of control’ in South Sudan||It began with a dry cough, weakness and back pain. For Reagan Taban Augustino, part of South Sudan’s small corps of health workers trained in treating Covid-19 patients, there was little doubt what he had.Days later, hardly able to breathe, the 33-year-old doctor discovered just how poorly equipped his country is for the coronavirus pandemic: None of the public facilities he tried in the capital, Juba, had oxygen supplies available until he reached South Sudan’s only permanent infectious disease unit, which has fewer than 100 beds for a country of 12 million people.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIt took more than an hour to admit him. “I was almost dying at the gate,” he told The Associated Press from the unit last week.The pandemic is now accelerating in Africa, the World Health Organization says. While the continent had more time than Europe and the United States to prepare before its first case was confirmed on Feb. 14, experts feared many of its health systems would eventually become overwhelmed.South Sudan, a nation with more military generals than doctors, never had a fighting chance. Five years of civil war and corruption stripped away much of its health system, and today nongovernmental organizations provide the majority of care. Nearly half of the population was hungry before the pandemic. Deadly insecurity continues, and a locust outbreak arrived just weeks before the virus.When world leaders talk about the pandemic not being over until it’s over everywhere, they are talking about places like South Sudan.The United Nations says the country’s outbreak is growing rapidly, with nearly 1,900 cases, including more than 50 health workers infected, more than 30 deaths and no way to know the true number of infections. At one point several members of the Covid-19 task force tested positive, including Vice President Riek Machar.“It can be out of control at any time,” said David Gai Zakayo, a doctor with the aid group Action Against Hunger.“The groups we are treating are malnourished,” Zakayo said. “My big worry is if the virus begins spreading to those groups we are treating, it will be a disaster.”At South Sudan’s only laboratory that tests for the virus, supervisor Simon Deng Nyichar said the team of 16 works up to 16-hour days slogging through a backlog of more than 5,000 tests. Around 9,000 samples have been tested since early April, when the country became one of the last in Africa to confirm a coronavirus case.With materials in short supply, testing is largely limited to people with symptoms of Covid-19. It can take weeks to receive results, “creating mistrust in communities and resentment toward contact tracers,” the Health Ministry said last week.Three lab workers have been infected and recovered, Nyichar told the AP. “This is the nature of our work. We are not scared of the disease.”With the long hours, they work in pairs to stay sharp. “It’s a must for everybody to have a buddy as a helper to monitor all the steps on the dos and don’ts, otherwise we would have infected all of us,” he said.While they’re aware of the dangers, South Sudan’s population at large still takes convincing.The government’s loosening of lockdown measures last month was “perceived as an indication that the disease is not in South Sudan,” the Health Ministry said. Bars, restaurants and shops are open after people said they feared hunger more than the disease.Some people have died waiting for rapid-response teams to arrive, the ministry said. And this month it stopped issuing “Covid-19 negativity certificates,” citing the peddling of fake ones — especially around Juba International Airport.Meanwhile the virus has spread into more rural areas, including one of the United Nations-run camps upcountry where more than 150,000 civilians still shelter after South Sudan’s civil war ended in 2018.There’s been an increase in deaths related to respiratory tract infections at that camp in Bentiu, WHO official Wamala Joseph told reporters last week, though it’s not clear whether they were from the virus. Testing is difficult as all samples must be flown to the capital. “This is a very vulnerable population,” he said.Three of the six camps have no virus screening at the gate, according to a U.N. migration agency document dated this month. One camp has no facility to isolate the sick, and another will only have one when a generator is installed. Listed under preventative measures for the two camps in Juba, home to 30,000 people: “Face masks to be distributed in coming weeks.”Meanwhile “our hospitals are full,” Wolde-Gabriel Saugeron, who leads the International Committee of the Red Cross’ team in Bor, wrote last week. “Covid-19 means that we need to create more space between our hospital beds, which has reduced the number of people we can accommodate in our wards by 30%.”The pandemic is also worsening what was already a major problem in South Sudan: hunger.Most border crossings are closed, and food prices in the markets have shot up. Now the rainy season has started, making transport and storage more difficult.More than 1.5 million people in South Sudan are newly vulnerable, including the urban poor who had not been receiving aid before, the U.N. humanitarian agency said last week.“I cannot be saying famine, but I can say Covid-19 will worsen the situation,” said Kawa Tong, health and nutrition manager for the aid group CARE.She knows the country already faced a long and winding path to emerge from multiple crises, starting with progress on the peace agreement that ended the civil war. Security would need to improve, people would find the confidence to return to their homes and begin cultivating their crops, and hunger would fall.But now, of course, there’s the pandemic, and Tong has no idea when or how it will end.“People are overwhelmed,” she said. “People are scared.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-could-spin-out-of-control-in-south-sudan/story-pihF2VKd08yzq8s8fi9GJO.html
22-06-2020||World||Fearing second Covid-19 wave, Europe aims to train ‘army’ of medics||Europeans are enjoying the gradual easing of coronavirus lockdown measures, but in hospitals they are already preparing for the next wave of infections.Some intensive care specialists are trying to hire more permanent staff. Others want to create a reservist “army” of medical professionals ready to be deployed wherever needed to work in wards with seriously ill patients. European countries have been giving medics crash courses in how to deal with Covid-19 patients, and are now looking at ways to retrain staff to avoid shortages of key workers if there is a second wave of the novel coronavirus.“We need a healthcare army,” said Maurizio Cecconi, president-elect of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), which brings together medics from around the world who work in wards with extremely ill patients.Cecconi, who heads the intensive care department at the Humanitas hospital in Milan, says medical staff need to be more flexible in the work they do, and more mobile.“If there is another big wave, we should be prepared to deploy doctors and nurses from nearby regions within Italy. This did not happen a lot in the first wave,” he told Reuters.Many countries were caught unprepared by the Covid-19 pandemic in March and April, and hastily retrained medics to work with patients with severe cases of the disease, to ramp up numbers and replace those who fell sick.Some sent medical students and retired doctors to help out in intensive care wards as hospital staff were overwhelmed. Those worst-hit by the pandemic had to provide more beds and essential equipment for acute care units, and some built new hospitals.But problems and shortages persist. Italy, for example, may need to boost by 50% the number of anaesthetists, resuscitation experts and other medics it has working in intensive care, according to the Italian society of intensive care SIAARTI. CRASH COURSESAcross Europe, hospitals have been re-training surgeons, cardiologists, internal medicine physicians and nurses from other departments, and have moved them to intensive care units when needed. Many have attended crash courses on how to handle Covid-19 patients, said Jozef Kesecioglu, president of ESICM and head of intensive care at the University Medical Center of Utrecht, in the Netherlands.“We gave them jobs with less responsibility, such as washing patients, turning patients around, checking the lungs or looking at scans,” he told Reuters.Intensive care specialists had continued to do the most delicate work, such as handling tubes in patients’ throats or adjusting mechanical ventilation, Kesecioglu said.He plans to call back the same people to offer them more training. Under normal circumstances, intensive care workers undergo years of training but he said: “We should not wait until the new wave comes, we should give them regular training.” The Netherlands is trying to recruit more skilled workers and hopes to narrow structural gaps in the intensive care workforce, said Rotterdam’s Erasmus Medical Centre, one of the largest university hospitals in Europe. SIAARTI says medical students who specialise in intensive care medicine should be fully integrated into wards for the last two years of their five-year training, and has recommended financial incentives be offered to attract more students. The European Commission, the European Union’s executive, funded cross-border transfers of medical staff to the most affected countries at the height of the coronavirus crisis.In April, teams of “flying doctors” were sent from Norway and Romania to Italy.But the experiment has failed to gather much support, and Cecconi said moving doctors from one country to another “should be an option but not the first option,” as language barriers may make them less effective. Some patients were also moved around to receive treatment. France transferred some to less-affected regions of the country and sent others to Germany, which also took in Covid-19 patients from Italy.But Cecconi warned of transportation risks and logistical complications. “Often our patients are very sick,” he said. “I’d rather have skilled people who know how to work in my environment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fearing-second-covid-19-wave-europe-aims-to-train-army-of-medics/story-44FlZVLpNF4vzY2nYdm7HK.html
22-06-2020||World||Black candidates tap protest energy to challenge Democrats||Amy McGrath and Eliot Engel live hundreds of miles apart in states with dramatically different politics.Yet they are both the preferred candidates of the Democratic Party’s Washington establishment as voters in Kentucky and New York decide their congressional primary elections on Tuesday. And both may be in trouble.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOn the eve of their elections, Engel, a 16-term House incumbent who represents parts of the Bronx and New York City’s wealthy suburbs, and McGrath, a former military officer and fundraising juggernaut running in her first Kentucky Senate campaign, are facing strong challenges from lower-profile Black candidates. The challengers have tapped into the wounded progressive movement’s desire for transformational change suddenly animated by sweeping civil rights protests across America.Engel’s challenger, 45-year-old former public school principal Jamaal Bowman, and McGrath’s opponent, 35-year-old state Rep. Charles Booker, speak openly about their personal experience with police brutality and racism as they promote progressive plans to transform the nation’s health care system and economy. And both accuse their white opponents of being absent from the front lines of the civil rights debate.Bowman and Booker have also won the endorsement of Bernie Sanders, among a growing list of progressive leaders trying to influence the races from afar. The Vermont senator failed to win the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination, but he continues to shape congressional primaries — even if it puts him at odds with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is backing Engel, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who helped recruit McGrath.“There is no question the momentum is with us,” Sanders said in an interview.But the story of Bowman and Booker’s rise extends well beyond the yearslong tug-of-war between the progressive and pragmatic wings of the Democratic Party. They did not gain traction until after George Floyd’s death last month triggered nationwide outrage about racial inequality.Hours before polls open, however, it’s far from certain their bids will be successful.In New York, the progressive pushback against Engel’s reelection was somewhat surprising given his status as one of the Democratic Party’s most liberal members. He has also drawn overwhelming support from African Americans in Congress and establishment leaders such as Hillary Clinton.In an interview, he noted that he was a founding member of the House Medicare for All Caucus, an original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, and the endorsed candidate of the congressional Black and Hispanic caucuses.“I’ve always believed that Black lives matter. I didn’t have to see a tragedy to know that,” said Engel, 73. “All I can do for people is say, ‘Here’s my record.’ I can’t control outside events.”Engel admits regret over an unforced error of sorts earlier in the month when he was caught on a hot microphone telling a New York colleague at a news conference about the civil unrest: “If I didn’t have a primary, I wouldn’t be here.”He says the comments were taken out of context, but he also understands why some people would be upset.“Do I wish the whole event hadn’t happened? Sure. But it doesn’t change my record,” Engel said.Bowman seized on the comment and the perception that Engel has lost touch with the entirety of his diverse district, which features Westchester County’s multimillion-dollar homes and the Bronx’s housing projects. In both communities, Bowman said, there is a growing sense of unity around racial justice.“We’re seeing protests and uprisings in communities that are white and wealthy and stereotypically don’t care about racial justice,” he said in an interview. “That’s inspiring and it’s helpful to us because everyone knows we were talking about police brutality. I was sharing my personal story, and we were going after institutional racism from the very beginning of our campaign.”The winner of the New York House primary on Tuesday is expected to win the general election easily given the district’s strong Democratic tilt. Kentucky’s Senate primary will determine which Democrat runs against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is unpopular but a proven political force in a deep-red state.Washington Democrats helped recruit McGrath, thinking her military history and centrist approach would play well, even in a state that backed Trump by 30 points four years ago. The former Marine fighter pilot reported an eye-popping $19 million in the bank at the beginning of the month. Booker reported just $285,000 at that time, although his campaign told the AP he raised at least $2.4 million more this month.Booker’s recent fundraising surge coincides with the protests, although it’s unclear whether the focus on racial inequality will resonate to the same degree in a state where just 8% of residents are Black and 3 out of 4 don’t have a bachelor’s degree, according to the Census Bureau.“It is real,” Booker said of racism in his state. “I’ve had ancestors lynched in Kentucky.”Just this month, he says he was tear-gassed by police in the Louisville district he represents while attending a peaceful rally.“I’m there to make sure people are safe, make sure nothing goes wrong and that people’s voices are heard. And we look up and three canisters are thrown within 10 feet of me,” Booker told the AP. “Everyone starts running. And I just stood there in disbelief — that even though I have done all this work across Kentucky, even though I’m an elected official, they still saw me as a young Black man, and they still felt like it was justified to throw tear gas at me. It hurt.”McGrath’s critics say she has been a less visible presence at protests, though she has attended some. She’s also drawn criticism from her party’s far left wing for resisting policy proposals such as “Medicare for All.” And she’s not willing to call Trump a racist, even if she thinks his words and actions have been.Still, McGrath has not shied away from questions about race. In an interview, she called on white people to do more to fight systemic racism.“We need to stand up for what’s right and talk to other white people and call it out when we see it,” she said. “Whatever the solution is, we want to be part of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-candidates-tap-protest-energy-to-challenge-democrats/story-BudbO9iygUa2hiVnKEglUN.html

22-06-2020||World||Trump rejected PM Modi’s waiver case on Iran curbs, writes Bolton||US President Donald Trump had personally shut down a fierce debate among his aides in April 2019 on additional exemptions for countries like India from US sanctions on Iran oil purchases and ordered wavering officials to “go to zero”, former National Security Adviser John Bolton writes in his upcoming book.Bolton writes that Trump had pointedly “not been sympathetic” to India’s case as made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.These deliberations took place around April 18, and on April 21, the United States announced the end of waivers from secondary sanctions for countries that continued to buy Iranian crude, forcing India, a net importer of crude, and others impacted to look for new suppliers.Also read: Covid-19 pandemic - WHO reports largest single-day increase in coronavirus casesIt had not been an easy decision, according to Bolton, who gives a first peek at behind-the-scene discussions that had preceded, even though it’s tainted by his known hawkish stand on Iran.Trump had been “vibrating increasingly” on the end-the-waivers side of the scale, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was “wobbly”, writes Bolton, and the state department officials were afflicted by “clientitis” - a phrase he uses to imply they were loyal to countries in their assignment portfolios and not the US.“But India is so important,” he writes, citing state department officials. Or, “Japan is so important.” Bolton says he could understand India’s case that it will not easily find an alternative supplier at the same low price Iran was charging. But its position was inconsistent with America’s, he argued.Also read: In a blow to Indians, Donald Trump says H-1B suspension coming any day nowTrump ended the discussions on April 18. “‘Go to zero,’” Bolton writes quoting the president, and goes on to add that “in a phone call with Pompeo, Trump had not been sympathetic to India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying, ‘He’ll be okay’”.Iran was the second-largest supplier of crude for India at the time and the sanctions significantly disrupted India’s oil supplies. But they left untouched Indian investments in Chabahar port in Iran, which provides India crucial trade routes into Afghanistan and up north Central Asian countries. India was indeed “okay” with the Trump administration’s decision, thus, and has since found other sellers, including the United States. India and a bunch of other countries, including US allies Japan and South Korea, were granted waivers from the first round of sanctions that went into effect in November 2018 following President Trump’s decision announced earlier in the year to withdraw the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) signed in 2015 by the US, UK, France, Russia, China and the EU with Iran. It had ended UN-led sanctions, bolstered by US add-ons, in return for Iran mothballing its nuclear weapons programme.The former NSA has been surprisingly dismissive of the February-March 2019 crisis between India and Pakistan stemming from the capture of an Indian Air Force pilot by Pakistan, which the United States had waded into to prevent an escalation between two countries with nuclear arms.“After hours of phone calls, the crisis passed, perhaps because, in substance, there never really had been one,” Bolton writes nonchalantly of the crisis and the outcome negotiated by the US in the middle of Trump’s high-profile second summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un. Trump had opened his post-summit news conference in Hanoi on March 2 saying he had some “decent news” that would end India-Pakistan tensions. The captured pilot crossed over at the Wagah border hours later.“But when two nuclear powers spin up their military capabilities, it is best not to ignore it,” he adds in the book, but essentially to reprise his well-known reservations about Trump’s outreach to Kim.On the other sanctions issue, stemming from the Countering American Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) that targets Russia and seeks to punish it by scaring away its major defence purchases with the threat of secondary sanctions, Bolton says the president had asked him to look into an article that said India was buying Russian S-400 missile defence system because it finds them better than the American Patriots.The US has offered Terminal High Altitude Area Defense systems (THAAD) and Patriot Advanced Capability missile defence system as an alternative to the S-400. But India is sticking with the Russian deal for now.The book also confirms Trump had been dismissive of the $3 billion Indian assistance in Afghanistan. “India builds a library and advertises it all over,” Bolton writes, quoting Trump. India has built and repaired many structures as part of its reconstruction efforts, but a library is not among them. The president might have been referring to the Afghan parliament India has constructed on the outskirts of Kabul.Bolton’s book, ‘The Room Where It Happened’, is based on his 16 months as Trump’s third National Security Adviser. The print edition is slated for release Tuesday, but pirated editions were available online over the weekend.The book has already generated a fair amount of interest and controversy, as reported by Hindustan Times earlier, with Bolton claiming President Trump pleaded with President Xi Jinping of China to help him win a second term and backed his repressive measures in Hong Kong and the concentration camps for Uyghur Muslims.Bolton also writes that Trump’s closest and loyal aides mocked him behind his back, such as Pompeo, who, the ex-NSA writes, passed him a note during a meeting with Kim, saying Trump is “full of s…”. Pompeo has denied it and called Bolton a “traitor”.Bolton has also been criticized by Trump critics for not coming out to testify during the president’s impeachment trial and that he sat it out for the sake of his lucrative book deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-rejected-pm-modi-s-waiver-case-on-iran-curbs-writes-bolton/story-YfR0EAoon3gTU5eVfQKRCJ.html

US gold futures rose 0.8% to $1,766.90.“General risk aversion is helping the market, we are seeing pressure on growth exposed currencies and on share markets. Overall, there are concerns about increasing infection rates,” said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets.“The market is concerned about the outlook for growth and that of course is supportive for gold.”The World Health Organization reported a record increase in global coronavirus cases on Sunday.Rising infections in the United States and elsewhere dented hopes for a quick economic recovery and weighed on investors’ appetite for riskier assets. Meanwhile, two Federal Reserve officials sounded increasing pessimism on the swiftness of any economic recovery from the virus and warned the unemployment rate could rise again if the disease is not brought under control.Geopolitical tensions also supported the safe-haven asset amid developments in Hong Kong, as details of a new national security law for the territory showed Beijing will have overarching powers over its enforcement.Indicative of sentiment, SPDR Gold Trust holdings rose 2% to 1,159.31 tonnes on Friday, while speculators increased their bullish positions in COMEX gold and silver contracts in the week to June 16.

22-06-2020||World||Worst North Korea economy in two decades pushing Kim Jong Un to lash out||Blowing up a building meant to symbolize friendship may have been North Korea’s forceful way of demanding help for an economy straining under international sanctions and borders shut by the coronavirus.The destruction of the $15 million facility paid for by South Korea in the North Korean border city of Kaesong was one of the biggest provocations Kim Jong Un’s regime has made against its neighbour in years.Kim Jong Un destroys joint Korea office in rebuke to SeoulSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in’s government has warned Kim against reckless provocations, but the destroying of the building so far hasn’t derailed plans in parliament to revive inter-Korean cooperation or attempts to persuade the Trump administration to loosen its stance on Pyongyang.As analysts struggle to reach a consensus on the logic behind the explosive move, the immediate result has been to inject urgency into talks between the US and South Korea over Pyongyang.Moon sent his nuclear envoy to Washington after the building came crashing down to speak with US officials about ways to deal with the current situation on the Korean Peninsula, the Foreign Ministry said last week. Lee Do-hoon returned home over the weekend but shared few details about the discussions with reporters at the airport, Yonhap News agency reported.The US and UN sanctions are aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program.Any loosening of the restrictions on trade and transactions would bode well for North Korea because its economy now risks shrinking 6% this year, according to Fitch Solutions. That would be its worst contraction since 1997, when the country was stricken by famine.The heightened economic malaise compounds troubles faced by Kim after his nearly three-week absence from public events in April led to speculation about his health and questions about his grip on power.Trade with China, North Korea’s biggest economic partner, had already slowed to a trickle under the sanctions as President Xi Jinping also sought to rein in Kim’s nuclear ambitions.But the flow of goods hit a wall after Pyongyang sealed the country’s borders earlier this year to halt Covid-19. In both March and April, North Korea’s exports to China fell more than 90% from a year ago, China’s Customs General Administration reported.“The larger economic context certainly shows Pyongyang getting backed into a corner,” said Kyle Ferrier, director of academic affairs at the Korea Economic Institute of America. “Sanctions were clearly impacting the North Korean economy prior to Covid-19, but the closure of the border with China to curb the spread of the coronavirus has done much more to stymie the North Korean economy.”While the contraction may not seem large in a world where the virus has sent economies plummeting, North Korea is one of the planet’s poorest countries and can ill afford a turn for the worse.Money from South Korea would help. Due to the sanctions, trade between the neighbors has slowed to just $3.5 million through May of this year from $2.7 billion in 2015.Humanitarian assistance has also dried up under Trump’s maximum pressure sanctions campaign. South Korea has sent about $3 billion of aid since 1995, but only a total of $30 million came between 2017 and 2019, according to the latest government data.The liaison office was located near a joint factory park where South Korean firms once used cheap North Korean labor to manufacture goods. The intended model of economic cooperation earned North Korea an estimated $100 million a year.North Korea sent in troops to occupy the facility in 2016, during a previous snarling of tensions, and it remains shut under the sanctions.Sanctions bustingBefore the pandemic, North Korea had been getting better at poking holes in the sanctions regime through trading of contraband and restricted commodities on the high seas, UN Security Council reports have shown.It had also turned to cyber crime, taking in about $2 billion in 2019 through the worldwide theft of resources from the financial sector, according to testimony to a US House committee in June.But it also participated in negotiations aimed at easing sanctions through talks with long time friends China and Russia and foes including the US and South Korea.Following three summits with Trump since 2018 that produced no sanctions relief, North Korea earlier this month accused the US of breaking promises and said it saw no benefit in engaging with Washington.“The rapprochement efforts over the past years have not yielded much in terms of economic relief for North Korea,” said Anwita Basu, a Fitch analyst. “They have chosen an adversarial route arguably in hopes that South Korea might get bullied into helping them, but as always, such tactics could backfire.”Kim’s frustration shows in a recent series of threats against Moon, with the leader of North Korea’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, personally launching verbal attacks against a man she once hobnobbed with during her visit to Seoul in 2018.“Because North Korea’s economic downturn is fueling its aggression, and is worsened by sanctions, there are no near-term off-ramps here,” said Van Jackson, a former Pentagon official now teaching at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand.“The reasoning that led North Korea to destroy the liaison office will lead them to engage in even more provocative behavior over the next year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worst-north-korea-economy-in-two-decades-pushing-kim-jong-un-to-lash-out/story-ApQYf7sbzmVMdFkGuD4mzN.html

North Korea said it will fly propaganda leaflets and take other steps to nullify 2018 deals that were meant to ease military tensions at the border.Yoh Sangkey, a spokesman at Seoul’s Unification Ministry, told reporters that North Korea must suspend its plan to send anti-Seoul leaflets that “are not helpful to South-North (Korea) relations at all.” Earlier Monday, North Korea said it had manufactured 12 million propaganda leaflets to be floated toward South Korea aboard 3,000 balloons and other unspecified delivery equipment.“Our plan of distributing the leaflets against the enemy is an eruption of the unquenchable anger of all the people and the whole society,” the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said. “The time for retaliatory punishment is drawing near.” Some observers say ongoing weather conditions aren’t favorable for North Korea to fly balloons into the South so it may use drones to deliver the leaflets. They say this could trigger clashes between the Koreas because South Korea must respond to incoming drones to its territory.A South Korean activist recently said he would also drop about a million leaflets over the border around Thursday, the 70th anniversary of the start of the 1950-53 Korean War. South Korean officials have said they’ll ban civilian activists from launching balloons toward North Korea.Experts say North Korea is likely focusing on the South Korean civilian leafleting to boost its internal unity and apply more pressures on Seoul and Washington amid stalled nuclear diplomacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/s-korea-urges-north-korea-not-to-send-leaflets-amid-high-tensions/story-QT1CFMX3ZCTmtJHewZRfJJ.html
22-06-2020||World||New Covid-19 hotspots are emerging in rural villages across India||After overwhelming India’s megacities, the coronavirus is now moving through the country’s vast hinterland.Home to nearly 70% of India’s 1.3 billion population, the nation’s villages have little access to health care and are struggling to support themselves through the country’s prolonged economic slowdown.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageInitially isolated from the epidemic that has swamped the capital New Delhi and financial center Mumbai, rural areas were exposed when millions of migrant workers who lost their jobs in the cities when the government implemented a strict nationwide lockdown on March 25 went home.The states of Bihar, Assam, Jharkhand, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh received the most number of returning laborers -- now they are also witnessing the sharpest rise in new cases in the two weeks to June 8, according to internal government estimates seen by Bloomberg. In the rural districts of Rajasthan and Karnataka, the virus is also spreading rapidly, it showed.Infections have now spread to 98 of the country’s 112 poorest rural districts, up from 34 on April 15, according to the report from NITI Aayog, the government’s planning body. Nearly 2,250 new cases were added in those districts.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration runs the risk of a burgeoning death toll if the pandemic’s spread is not checked in rural India, where under-funded health care infrastructure and poor living conditions provide fertile ground for the virus. India is already the world’s fourth most affected country, and an exponential rise in cases in the villages could catapult it higher. With the crisis pushing the economy toward its first full-year contraction in more than four decades, the likelihood of increasing social unrest continues to grow.The Prime Minister’s Office didn’t respond to an email seeking comment for this story.‘Living in fear’In the agricultural Ganjam district in Odisha, the Choudhari Tikarapada village of 5,000 people was coronavirus free till the end of May.That all changed when about 200 laborers returned home to the area after they lost their jobs in the states of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu during the lockdown. They were quarantined for seven days before entering the village. Soon after 13 were found Covid-19 positive, prompting the administration to declare it a containment zone, stopping any movement of people.“If tests are conducted in my village then more infected persons will be found,” said villager Sadananda Sahu, adding it is impossible to maintain social distancing and hygiene in his area. “We are living in fear.”Districts like Ganjam are among India’s poorest and have a skeletal health infrastructure, with most villagers accessing hospitals in nearby cities. Indis spent just 3.7% of gross domestic product on health care in 2016, putting it in the bottom 25 countries globally, according to the most recent World Bank data, leaving hospitals at risk of becoming quickly overwhelmed with virus cases.All 33 rural districts in Rajasthan have also been affected, after more than 1.1 million laborers from cities including Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad came home in May, said Raghu Sharma, the desert state’s health minister. “They came to their villages from highly infected places,” said Sharma. “Thus it spread in the villages of Rajasthan.”The state has set up quarantine facilities in each village, deployed senior level officials to monitor them and and formed village panels to check people’s movement, Sharma said. The state has enough isolation beds, ICU rooms, and personal protective equipment to deal with the situation and was ramping up testing capacity to 40,000 per day from current 25,250 over the next two weeks, he said.Low testing“Rural death rates for nearly all infectious conditions are considerably higher than in urban areas,” said Prabhat Jha, professor at the University of Toronto, citing a study. He called on the government to release all de-identified data on positive tests so epidemiologists can better understand how the virus is traveling through India. “Had the lockdown been a true lockdown, with workers not being kicked out of their urban places of residence, the problem would not have spread,” Jha said.India’s low testing rates over the last two months have added to the uncertainty. India had tested more than 6.8 million samples as of June 20, according to the Indian Council for Medical Research. The country has so far reported more than 410,000 infections and nearly 13,300 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.The eastern state of Jharkhand has about 1,500 confirmed cases. Just 117 are from urban centers, while the rest are from rural areas, which witnessed a surge following arrival of people from outside the state, said Nitin Kulkarni, secretary of the health department. The authorities have worked to stop the spread by isolating infected people at quarantine centers, Kulkarni said on June 11.About 5.7 million migrants have been shifted to various destinations across the country by special trains and a further 4.1 million by road transport, according to a government filing in the country’s top court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-hotspots-are-emerging-in-rural-villages-across-india/story-j1IbU0uaZeGvnF7rxj4X8M.html
22-06-2020||World||Covid-19: Cases, infection curve and fatalities in 7 high caseload countries||The coronavirus disease has been spreading rapidly across the world since the outbreak was first reported in China late last year. After China, the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen, which causes a respiratory disease, severely affected the United States and other European country.Among the countries hit early by the spread of the coronavirus disease was Iran. The virus hit the country in February and since then, Iran has struggled to contain the outbreak.Italy was hit the hardest by the spread if the coronavirus disease in Europe. Here is a look at the countries with the highest caseload of the Covid-19 and the latest situation there:United States: The US is the hardest-hit where the pandemic has infected more than 2.2 million people in the United States, claiming around 1,20,000 lives and infections are rising in many parts of the country. The US diagnosed its first Covid-19 case in Washington state on January 20. The curve of the infection has been steeply rising in the US since the month of April, though some governors of states claim the rate of infection has slowed down. The highest fatalities have been in New York.Brazil: The Latin American country is the world’s number 2 coronavirus hotspot after the United States. It officially passed 50,000 coronavirus deaths on Sunday. Brazil has already seen its Covid-19 tally rise to more than one million cases. Brazil confirmed its first case of the novel coronavirus on February 26. Experts say the true numbers are a lot higher because of a lack of widespread testing.Russia: The country reported 7,728 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Sunday, pushing its nationwide case tally to 5,84,680. Russia’s coronavirus response centre said that 109 people had died in the last 24 hours, bringing the official death toll in the country to 8,111.United Kingdom: Britain has one of the highest death tolls in the world from Covid-19, but the number of cases has been steadily falling in recent weeks. The death toll rose by 43 to 42,632, one of the lowest increases since the lockdown was imposed in March. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will unveil the latest easing of Britain’s coronavirus lockdown on Tuesday.Peru: The coronavirus has been rapidly spreading in the Latin American region. Peru has been one of the hardest hit countries, with the country logging close to 2.5 lakh cases. The disease has killed close to 8,000 people in the country Peru has adopted some of Latin America’s earliest and most stringent measures, but these have failed to check the spread of Covid-19.Italy: This European country on Sunday reported 224 new coronavirus cases 24 deaths in the past day, bringing its official death toll in the pandemic to 34,634. It is among the 10 worst-affected countries by the coronavirus pandemic. The total number of cases in Italy is 2,38,275, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).Iran: Iran reported its first coronavirus cases on February 19 and has since struggled to contain the outbreak, the deadliest in the Middle East. Iranian health authorities reported over 100 new deaths from the novel coronavirus Sunday for the third day running, pushing up the overall number to 9,623. Iran recorded its lowest single-day death toll in early May, before seeing a new rise in cases in recent weeks. The total number of infections in Iran is 2,04,952.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-infection-curve-and-fatalities-in-7-high-caseload-countries/story-YGWupTnh18XAfe5aGSVb8I.html

It is the right decision and the right time to remove this problematic statue.” The museum’s president, Ellen Futter, told the New York Times that the museum’s “community has been profoundly moved by the ever-widening movement for racial justice that has emerged after the killing of George Floyd.” “We have watched as the attention of the world and the country has increasingly turned to statues as powerful and hurtful symbols of systemic racism,” Futter told the Times.Officials said it hasn’t been determined when the Roosevelt statue will be removed and where it will go.“The composition of the Equestrian Statue does not reflect Theodore Roosevelt’s legacy,” Theodore Roosevelt IV, a great-grandson of the president, said in a statement to the Times. “It is time to move the statue and move forward.” Futter said the museum objects to the statue but not to Roosevelt, a pioneering conservationist whose father was a founding member of the institution and who served as New York’s governor before becoming the 26th president.She said the museum is naming its Hall of Biodiversity for Roosevelt “in recognition of his conservation legacy.” In 2017, protesters splashed red liquid on the statue’s base to represent blood and published a statement calling for its removal as an emblem of “patriarchy, white supremacy and settler-colonialism.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/museum-to-remove-roosevelt-statue-decried-as-white-supremacy/story-qIdcXvHRJRwS1KAWkyZqQM.html

Of the 3,748 employees tested, 481 tested positive for Covid-19, and 455 were asymptomatic.There have been several other Covid-19 outbreaks at Tyson plants around the United States, including in North Carolina, Nebraska, and Iowa.In November, China lifted a five-year ban on US poultry. China had blocked US poultry imports a month after an outbreak of avian influenza in December 2014, closing off a market that brought more than $500 million worth of American chicken, turkey and other poultry products in 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-test-positive-for-coronavirus-at-tyson-foods-plant-in-arkansas/story-lELT9Y0uUX4ViVcafO0bnO.html

But over the weekend, it was available in ways even his publisher is hoping to prevent.A PDF of “The Room Where It Happened” has turned up on the internet, offering a free, pirated edition of the former national security adviser’s scathing takedown of President Donald Trump, who has alleged that the book contains classified material that never should have been released.“We are working assiduously to take down these clearly illegal instances of copyright infringement,” Simon & Schuster spokesperson Adam Rothberg said Sunday.Piracy has long been a top concern among publishers, especially in the digital age, although the actual impact on sales is undetermined. “The Room Where It Happened” has been No. 1 for days on the Amazon.com bestseller list. The Associated Press was among several news outlets that obtained early copies of the book and reported on its contents.On Saturday, a federal judge ruled that Simon & Schuster could publish the book despite the Trump administration’s contention that it compromised national security. “The Room Where It Happened” was originally scheduled for March, but was delayed twice as the White House reviewed the manuscript.Bolton’s legal team has said that he spent months addressing White House concerns about classified information and that Bolton had been assured in late April by the official he was working with that the manuscript no longer contained any such material.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pirated-editions-of-john-bolton-s-memoir-appear-online/story-dmOffAS5g51ANEtSaNkueK.html
22-06-2020||World||Long-dreaded increase in Covid-19 cases hits Iraq amid severe economic crisis||In Baghdad’s vast exhibition grounds, masked workers lugged hospital beds into rows for makeshift coronavirus wards, as doctors and officials sounded the alarm Sunday over a surge in virus cases in the capital. The long-dreaded scenario is gripping the country amid a severe economic crisis brought on by plummeting oil prices. But with a widening budget deficit, doctors are running low on medical equipment, including key protective gear. A cap on new hires is also expected to strain the already over-stretched system.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  As hospitals overflowed with patients, the Iraqi government announced temporary field hospitals will open throughout Baghdad, where infections are highest, to cope with the exponentially rising number of virus patients. Iraq’s health system was already battered by years of conflict as well as poor infrastructure and lack of funds. Work to erect the field hospital in the fair grounds began Saturday, and it will eventually provide beds for 400 men and 100 women. When the supply of hospital cots ran out, workers brought in metal-framed single beds. “God willing, there will be future plans to increase the number of beds and field hospitals,” said Mouhamed Bander, an engineer with the Al-Aqiq institution for charity. His organization set up the wards in tandem with the ministries of health and trade. Virus cases began rising after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, when families and friends typically get together to break the daylong fast. In less than a month, infections spiked seven-fold to over 30,868 as of Sunday, up from less than 4,000 at the end of May. Deaths also spiked, with over 1,100 killed among the confirmed cases, according to Health Ministry figures. Among the recent dead was legendary Iraqi soccer star Ahmed Radhi, 56, who died Sunday due to virus complications after fighting for over a week. He was beloved for scoring his country’s first and only World Cup goal in 1986, and was also a political figure. Iraq qualified for the World Cup just once, and Radhi’s goal is a source of pride for Iraqis, many of whom mourned his death on social media.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  The troubling increase in cases was due to more testing, but also a lack of public adherence to government measures, said Health Ministry spokesman Saif al-Badr. Testing increased from nearly 4,000 a day last month to over 13,000 in recent days. By next week, he said 20,000 samples will be examined daily. Iraq took drastic measures to stem the virus’s spread, including closing schools, restaurants, public gatherings and international borders. Despite the additional field hospitals in place, doctors on the front lines fear these measures won’t be enough to absorb the rising number of infections. Doctors said the Health Ministry relies heavily on rapid blood tests to identify the first signs of infection. If these are positive, swabs are taken to confirm whether it’s coronavirus using specialized testing kits. But blood tests are known to produce false positives. “Its overcrowding hospitals,” said a doctor in Baghdad. “It’s chaos.” The Iraqi health care workers and health officials all spoke on condition of anonymity because of recent measures by the ministry prohibiting them from talking to reporters. The manager of a hospital in the southern city of Karbala, which reached capacity this week, ordered staff not to conduct tests if symptoms weren’t present because “there are no more beds to admit people,” a doctor there said. Still, many with no apparent symptoms do have the virus. All of the health workers interviewed said they’d purchased their own protective equipment because hospital supplies were running low. “We are in a fog, we don’t know what is going on,” said the doctor in Karbala, who said they’d asked their hospital for gloves, masks and protective suits, but were told these had run out. Doctors in Basra and Baghdad cited similar issues. “The numbers concern us,” said a doctor in a major Baghdad hospital dealing with virus patients. “And we are already overstretched.” A senior official said the Health Ministry is in dire need of funds. But a budget hasn’t been approved by the government, which is grappling with severe shortfalls in the wake of falling oil prices. Iraq depends on crude exports to fund nearly 90% of state revenue. Allocations to the ministry are made on a month-to-month basis. “We need a budget twice the size of the previous budget,” said the official. But officials from the prime minister’s office said funds allocated to the Health Ministry also weren’t being spent efficiently. “The problem is logistics management, the network is weak,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. The official said multiple layers of central purchasing committees within the Health Ministry and in directorates across provinces are responsible for making purchases, instead of allowing hospitals to source materials directly. The ministry is also unable to make new hires, which are essential to cope with the rising number of cases. Recent graduates have been asked to volunteer their services until a state budget is approved. The move has sparked young doctors to lash out on social media. “I graduated in 2019 and the Iraqi government has prevented me and more than 2,200 newly graduated Iraqi doctors from practicing medicine,” said Dua’a al-Jarjees. Meanwhile, case numbers continue to rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/long-dreaded-increase-in-covid-19-cases-hits-iraq-amid-severe-economic-crisis/story-Am2b7KvRn9b7nIAhyO0nOO.html
22-06-2020||World||Injuries at US protests draw scrutiny to use of police weaponry||In law enforcement, they’re referred to as “nonlethal” tools for dealing with demonstrations that turn unruly: rubber bullets, pepper spray, batons, flash-bangs. But the now-familiar scenes of US police officers in riot gear clashing with protesters at Lafayette Park across from the White House and in other cities have police critics charging that the weaponry too often escalates tensions and hurts innocent people. “When you see riot gear, it absolutely changes the mood,” said Ron Moten, a longtime community organizer in the nation’s capital who was out demonstrating this weekend. He said it takes away any perception the officers could be empathetic. “If I went up to speak with a police officer and I’m covered in armour and holding a shield and a stick, don’t you think they would regard me as a threat?” “When we see riot gear, as black people it takes us back 400 years,” he said. Protesters in Denver arrived at the hospital with injuries from police projectiles that caused one person to lose an eye and left three other people with permanent eye damage, said Prem Subramanian, a physician who operated on some victims following demonstrations late last month. “They weren’t accused of any crime, and they came in with devastating eye injuries,” Subramanian said, adding that he was so upset about it that he complained to city officials, who promised to investigate any abuses. “We’re learning the consequences of using these weapons.” He said the injuries rivaled what he saw treating shrapnel damage to eyes of soldiers at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center who were injured by explosives in Iraq and Afghanistan. Rubber bullets and similar projectiles have damaged eyes or blinded at least 20 individuals from ages 16 to 59, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, since protests began over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Other tactics were on display at Lafayette Park, where police used chemical agents to break up a peaceful protest minutes before President Donald Trump posed for pictures outside a nearby church this month. In Buffalo, an officer used a baton to shove a 75-year-old man to the ground before that officer and others marched past as blood collected beneath the man’s head. Amnesty International has questioned whether equipping officers “in a manner more appropriate for a battlefield may put them in the mindset that confrontation and conflict are inevitable.” The growing use of less lethal weapons is “cause for grave concern” and may sometimes violate international law, said Agnes Callamard, director of Global Freedom of Expression at Columbia University and a U.N. adviser. She said the “basic rationale for less lethal weaponry is legitimate” after courts called for law enforcement agents to be given equipment enabling them to respond proportionately when necessary. In 1990, the United Nations issued basic principles on their use. Projectiles caused 53 deaths and 300 permanent disabilities among 1,984 serious injuries recorded by medical workers in over a dozen countries from 1990 to 2015, said Rohini Haar, an emergency room doctor in Oakland, California, and primary author of the 2016 Physicians for Human Rights report assembled with civil rights groups. She said there “are so many cases of misuse, it seems almost impossible to use them correctly.” Whether rubber, foam or bean bags, they exit guns with the force of a bullet and should not be used against protesters because they can maim and bounce or ricochet unpredictably, Haar said. Police, private security forces and military units seek to cause pain or incapacitate individuals with more than 75 types of rubber or plastic bullets from manufacturers in countries including the US, Brazil, China, Israel, South Africa and South Korea, according to the report, “Lethal in Disguise.” Wade Carpenter, police chief in Park City, Utah, said the tools are necessary when peaceful rallies are “hijacked by individuals that have come in with a nefarious purpose to create the riots, the looting, those type of things.”Many police forces “are very stringent on their training,” said Carpenter, an official with the International Association of Chiefs of Police, which has 32,000 police official members in 167 countries. “They’re very accountable, and others, you know, it’s kind of all over the board.” Officers target lawbreakers who attack police with bricks or baseball bats, but sometimes less-than-lethal options are “not perfectly accurate, so, that’s always a risk and those are calculated risks,” Carpenter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/injuries-at-us-protests-draw-scrutiny-to-use-of-police-weaponry/story-PRdOzBrrOUeRUUEkVu5inJ.html
22-06-2020||World||Drug check in Germany’s Stuttgart sparks attacks on police, vandalism||Police in the German city of Stuttgart said Sunday that 24 people were arrested and 19 police officers injured after a check for drugs sparked attacks on officers and police vehicles followed by widespread vandalism of storefronts in the city center. Police said several hundred people were involved.The disturbance started after officers stopped a 17-year-old on suspicion of drug possession as several hundred people partied outside around 11:30 pm Saturday, police said. Bystanders started throwing stones and bottles, and smaller groups ran through surrounding streets breaking shop windows, according to police.Police said 40 businesses were vandalized and nine of them had been looted, while 12 police vehicles were damaged before officers brought the situation under control around 4 am.Only one of the injured officers was seriously hurt enough to be considered unable to work, police said.Police officials said at a news conference that the violence had no apparent political motivation. They said the teen suspect initially stopped was a white German citizen. Of the two dozen people arrested, half held German passports and half were citizens of other countries.Stuttgart Mayor Fritz Kuhn, a member of the environmentalist Greens party, called the attacks on police “unacceptable.” He said that more people were on the street on Saturday night because many clubs and discos remain closed due to the coronavirus outbreak and that the party scene in a central park had drawn people from the surrounding area.“One cause was likely alcohol, another the addiction to social media film clips,” Kuhn said.Cellphone video purporting to be of the events circulated widely on social media. Police asked witnesses to upload videos that could provide evidence to assist their investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/drug-check-in-germany-s-stuttgart-sparks-attacks-on-police-vandalism/story-tIbN6SqVWtcPr2LheeiNaO.html
22-06-2020||World||US economy doing ‘amazingly’ well, says Trump||The US economy is doing “amazingly” well, President Donald Trump has said, stressing that America is witnessing “record-setting” numbers in terms of jobs.Trump made the comments on Saturday while responding to a question on the US economy, which has been battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The country’s unemployment rate for April was 14.7 per cent, which was the highest since 1948. With the addition of 2.5 million jobs, the monthly rate dropped to 13.3 per cent for May.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe economy had lost 22.1 million jobs in March and April when most parts of the US were under lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak. In May, some businesses have reopened and rehiring of workers has picked up. Trump had described the numbers as an affirmation of the good work his administration is doing.“The US economy is doing amazingly well,” Trump told reporters.“I would say that the numbers that we’re doing are record-setting numbers. We have record-setting job numbers,” he said.“We have record-setting, as you know, retail sales numbers; that just came out. The US economy is doing very, very well,” Trump asserted.Earlier Kevin Hassett, senior adviser to the president and former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers at the White House, told CNN that the country’s economy is coming back way faster than one thought.“Right now I think economists need to be humble and recognise that when we’ve got 17 states where credit card spending is above where it was last year already, that it suggests that this economy is really, really coming back way faster than I thought,” Hassette said.At the same time, he conceded that the economy would be hit if there was to be a second wave of the coronavirus. “If there is a second flare-up that’s, you know, bigger than what we’ve seen and the economy does have to move towards more shutdown,” he said.President Trump is focused on building a great economy, the strongest economy that the US has ever had, he told reporters at the White House on Friday.“I think that he had an enormous amount of success doing that through January. I think that the virus has upended that. But the comeback is way faster than anybody thought. Again, the average economist missed by ten million jobs in the last jobs report. And I think the reason why we’re coming back so fast is that the economy was so strong in January,” he said.“I’ve not ever had him say, oh we need to do this because I want to win the election. I have never heard him say that once,” he said responding to a question.Trump is seeking his re-election to the White House in the November 3 elections.The US is the worst-affected country from the pandemic.According to the Johns Hopkins University data, there are over 2.2 million coronavirus cases in America with more than 119,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-economy-doing-amazingly-well-says-trump/story-dWwaeQp2z90yclWDnH9JqJ.html

Trump, addressing his first election rally on Saturday in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in the US early this year, said that the Covid-19 is a disease and has many names than any disease in history. “I can name – Kung flu. I can name 19 different versions of names. Many calls it a virus, which it is. Many calls it a flu. What difference. I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name,” Trump said. Kung fu refers to the Chinese martial arts in which people use only their bare hands and feet to fight.

Navarro said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that Trump made the comment in a “light moment.” During Saturday’s rally in Tulsa, Trump explained that the “bad part” of widespread testing is that it leads to logging more virus cases. New cases have recently spiked in several US states, but not just due to testing.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage The United States has tested over 25 million people for the novel coronavirus. The country has reported more than 2.2 million confirmed cases and about 120,000 Covid-19 deaths. according to a count by Johns Hopkins University. The real numbers are believed to be higher.

22-06-2020||World||Joe Biden is ‘helpless puppet’ of radical left, says Trump||US President Donald Trump has kicked off his re-election campaign with a rally in Oklahoma where he launched a frontal attack on his Democratic opponent Joe Biden, describing him as a “helpless puppet” of the radical left. Trump, 74, is pitted against former vice president and Democratic Party’s presidential nominee Biden, 77, in the November 3 presidential election. As per the latest opinion polls, he is trailing behind Biden on an average by eight percentage points. Trump, in his address to the thousands of his supporters at an indoor stadium in Oklahoma’s Tulsa city on Saturday, said: “Biden is a helpless puppet of the radical left. And he’s not radical left. I don’t think he knows what he is any more. But he’s controlled by the radical left”. Addressing his first election rally after the coronavirus pandemic hit the country early this year, killing more than 119,000 Americans in a matter of few months and bringing the economy to a standstill, Trump alleged that the Biden campaign staff even donated a lot of money to bail out rioters, looters and arsonists who ravaged Minneapolis. Minneapolis erupted into violence following the brutal custodial death of African-American George Floyd on May 25. The protests spread nationwide and turned violent in many places including Washington DC, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. The president has accused radical left for the violence. “The left is trying to do everything they can to stop us every hour of every day including violence, mayhem, look what happened tonight. But we will never submit to their threats and we will never let them destroy our nation,” Trump said. In his speech that lasted for more than 100 minutes, Trump talked a lot on his favorite themes: fake news, energy dominance, appointing judges, supporting police and condemning protesters. “The unhinged left-wing mob is trying to vandalise our history, desecrating beautiful monuments, tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control, we’re not conforming. “That’s why we’re here actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so that they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments. Think of that,” said the president. Addressing the rally comprising thousands of his supporters, a majority of whom did not wear face masks or maintain social distancing, Trump called for a legislation that would punish burning American flags with one-year imprisonment. “We ought to do it. We talk about freedom of speech… but that’s desecration,” he said. His political opponents accused him of risking people’s health by holding such a big rally. Many said that parts of the arena were empty. As a precautionary measure, local police officials and campaign staff measured the temperature of everyone entering the arena. Six members of the campaign staff tested positive with COVID-19 before the rally. There was brief interruption during his speech when he paused and called for doctors, as security guards went to the aid of a young man who appeared to have fainted. He was helped out by a security guard on either side. “Thank you. These people, I mean some of the people are waiting for five days, especially at this location, right? You take your time,” Trump said. Around 15 per cent of the city’s 400,000 residents are black, according to the US media report. Outside the arena, a 62-year-old peaceful protester was arrested and dragged by security personnel while wearing a shirt that read “I can’t breathe.” Tulsa Police Department said that the protestor was removed at the request of the Trump campaign staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-is-helpless-puppet-of-radical-left-says-trump/story-1Cmpc0jTsoetggJDJkTDlI.html
22-06-2020||India||Army top brass assesses ground situation||New Delhi: The army’s top brass on Monday made a detailed assessment of the ground situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, where both India and China have significantly increased their troop deployment in the extended region on both sides of the contested border, two officers said on the condition of anonymity.The developments along the LAC and the army’s operational readiness to handle any situation were discussed at the army commanders’ conference, chaired by Army Chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane, one of the officers said.The situation along the Line of Control with Pakistan also came up during the discussions amid concerns that the western neighbour could try to take advantage of the tensions along the northern borders with China, second another officer.Later in the day, the army tweeted: “Army Commanders Conference #ACC-20 is being conducted on 22-23 June 2020 to review the operational situation on both the Northern and Western Fronts.”While the conference was pre-scheduled, it is being held at a time when the Indian and Chinese armies have marshalled thousands of soldiers on their respective sides of the LAC and the military buildup consists of fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns and missile systems, he said.The conference will conclude on Tuesday. It was the second phase of the conference--the first was held in Delhi on May 27-29.The top commanders met a day after defence minister Rajnath Singh made a detailed assessment of the situation at the disputed border and was briefed by the military brass about the preparations of the armed forces and their readiness to respond to any provocative actions by the Chinese forces.Singh left for Moscow on Monday for a four-day visit during which he will meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, and border tensions with China will figure in their talks. Singh will participate in the Victory Day parade on June 24 in Moscow to commemorate the surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945.Tensions between India and China have surged after the Galwan Valley brawl on June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers, including a commanding officer, dead. The Chinese army possibly suffered more than twice as many casualties, which also included a commanding officer, said another officer.With uncertainty looming along the LAC, the government has given financial powers worth Rs 500 crore per project to the armed forces to fast-track the purchase of critical weapons and ammunition to deal with any kind of scenario. Similar powers were bestowed on the military to pug gaps in capabilities after 2016 terror attack in Jammu & Kashmir’s Uri and the 2019 airstrikes in Pakistan’s Balakot in response to a suicide bombing in Pulwama that left 40 paramilitary troopers dead.INDEPENDENT COMMENT||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-top-brass-assesses-ground-situation/story-IuAfJ7OKqxuRcdpE9PtBKM.html
22-06-2020||India||PLA unit CO ‘among casualties’ in Galwan||New Delhi: A People’s Liberation Army (PLA) unit commanding officer (CO) was among scores of Chinese soldiers killed in the June 15 Galwan Valley clash with Indian troops along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. The Chinese commander’s death was confirmed to the Indian side through diplomatic and military channels last week, said one of the persons cited above, asking not to be named.China has not said anything about any losses it suffered in the hand-to-hand combat. At a regular briefing on Monday, the Chinese foreign ministry stalled a query on the number of casualties the PLA suffered.The brutal clash at Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh resulted in 20 Indian deaths, including that of a CO. The Chinese army possibly suffered more than twice the casualties, Union minister General V K Singh (retd) said on Saturday. It was the first such clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers along the contested LAC in 45 years.The Chinese CO’s body was among the bodies exchanged by the two sides after the clash was over on June 16, said another person cited above.The moment Indian soldiers realised that their CO, Colonel B Santosh Babu, had fallen, they fought against the Chinese soldiers with all their might and killed 16 of them and inflicted life-threatening injuries on scores of others in a fearsome counter-attack.The seven-hour face-off involved three staggered clashes and saw the Indian soldiers put up a fierce fight against Chinese troops, who had been pulled out of another sector and freshly deployed on the disputed border to carry out the premeditated attack, as reported by HT on Monday. The Indian and Chinese COs were killed in the second and the most fierce round of fighting.The clash involved 600 soldiers from both sides, with the Indians badly outnumbered.Details from the debriefing of Indian soldiers involved in the skirmish revealed the heroism of the Indian troops, who fought off numerically superior rivals and the tactics of the Chinese soldiers.The Indian soldiers were carrying weapons and ammunition. But they did not open fire as they were following border agreements between the two countries, the government said last week. The clarification came following a political controversy over whether the Indian soldiers were carrying weapons that could have been used to defend themselves.INDEPENDENT COMMENT||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-unit-co-among-casualties-in-galwan/story-54qe4y5LUoPqPX7XlbM2AJ.html
22-06-2020||India||Trump rejected Modi’s waiver case on Iran curbs, writes Bolton||President Donald Trump personally shut down a fierce debate among his aides in April 2019 on additional exemptions for countries such as India from US sanctions on Iran oil purchases and ordered wavering officials to “go to zero”, and he had “not been sympathetic” to India’s case as made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, former National Security Adviser John Bolton writes in his book, “The Room Where It Happened”.These deliberations took place around April 18, and the United States announced on April 21 the end of waivers from secondary sanctions for countries that continued to buy Iranian crude, forcing India, a net importer of crude, and others impacted to look for new suppliers.It was not an easy decision, according to Bolton, who gives the first peek at behind-the-scene discussions that preceded and is known for his hawkish stand on Iran.Trump was “vibrating increasingly” on the end-the-waivers side of the scale, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was “wobbly”, writes Bolton. State department officials were afflicted by “clientitis”, a phrase he uses to imply they were loyal to countries in their assignment portfolios, and not the US.“But India is so important,” he writes, citing state department officials. Or, “Japan is so important.” Bolton says he could understand India’s case that it will not easily find an alternative supplier at the same low price Iran was charging. But its position was inconsistent with America’s, he argued.Trump ended the discussions on April 18. “Go to zero,” Bolton quotes the President as saying, and goes on to add that “in a phone call with Pompeo, Trump had not been sympathetic to India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying, ‘He’ll be okay’.”Iran was the second largest supplier of crude for India at the time and the sanctions significantly disrupted India’s oil supplies. Indian investments in Chabahar port in Iran, which provides India crucial trade routes into Afghanistan and Central Asian countries, were left untouched. India was indeed “okay” with the Trump administration’s decision, thus, and has since found other sellers, including the United States.India and a bunch of other countries, including US allies Japan and South Korea, were granted waivers from the first round of sanctions that came into effect in November 2018, following President Trump’s decision earlier in the year to withdraw the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) signed in 2015 by the US, UK, France, Russia, China and the European Union with Iran. The pact ended United Nations-led sanctions, bolstered by US add-ons, in return for Iran mothballing its nuclear weapons programme.Bolton’s book is based on his 16 months as Trump’s third National Security Adviser. The print edition is slated for release on Tuesday, but pirated editions were available online over the weekend.The former NSA has been surprisingly dismissive of the February-March 2019 tensions between India and Pakistan after the capture of an Indian Air Force pilot by Pakistan. The United States had waded into the issue to prevent an escalation between the two nuclear-armed countries.“After hours of phone calls, the crisis passed, perhaps because, in substance, there never really had been one,” Bolton writes nonchalantly of the crisis.“But when two nuclear powers spin up their military capabilities, it is best not to ignore it,” he adds in the book, but essentially to reprise his well-known reservations about Trump’s outreach to North Korea’s Kim Jon Un.On the other sanctions issue, stemming from the Countering American Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) that targets Russia and seeks to punish it by scaring away its major defence purchases with the threat of secondary sanctions, Bolton says the President asked him to look into an article that said India was buying Russian S-400 missile defence system because it found them better than the American Patriots.The US has offered Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) systems and Patriot Advance Capability missile defence system as an alternative to the S-400. But India is sticking with the Russian deal for now.The book also confirms Trump was dismissive of the $3-billion Indian assistance in Afghanistan, as reported earlier. “India builds a library and advertises it all over,” Bolton writes, quoting Trump. India has built and repaired many structures as a part of its reconstruction efforts, but a library is not among them. The President might have been referring to the Afghan parliament India has constructed on the outskirts of Kabul.The book has already generated a fair amount of interest and controversy, as reported by Hindustan Times earlier, with Bolton claiming President Trump pleaded with President Xi Jinping of China to help him win a second term, and backed his repressive measures in Hong Kong and the concentration camps for Uyghur Muslims.Bolton also writes that Trump’s closest and loyal aides mocked him behind his back, such as Pompeo, who, the ex-NSA writes, passed him a note during a meeting with Kim, saying Trump is “full of s…”. Pompeo has denied it and called Bolton a “traitor”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trump-rejected-modi-s-waiver-case-on-iran-curbs-writes-bolton/story-iJbzQQRlxtpkFCOOLLEzGP.html
22-06-2020||India||CBSE to apprise SC over board exams||New Delhi: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is on Tuesday likely to inform the Supreme Court about the challenges it will face due to Covid-19 pandemic if it conducts remaining Class 10 and 12 board exams in July and then act according to its directions, Union Human Resource Development (HRD) ministry officials said.The officials said they feel the circumstances are not very conducive for conducting the examinations and it was felt that any final decision should be taken following the court’s direction.“The decision to conduct exams in July was taken with hope that the situation would normalise. However, there are a number of areas, including the national capital, where there are a large number of [Covid-19] cases. CBSE has made elaborate plans to ensure social distancing. However, there are challenges given the unpredictable nature of the pandemic. Therefore, CBSE will apprise the court about the situation and act according to its direction,” said an official, who did not wish to be named.The Supreme Court last week asked CBSE to consider scrapping the remaining papers and allotting marks on the basis of internal assessment. It asked CBSE to take instructions and inform the court by Tuesday about it.Officials said they will have to decide on criteria for allotting the marks if the exams are cancelled, which will also create uncertainty regarding the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) and National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) exams which were to follow the CBSE exams scheduled from July 1 to 15.“There can be criteria on the basis of internal assessment, on the basis of pre-boards or how the student performed in exams which were conducted. It is likely these aspects will also come up,” said the official.“The CBSE had drawn up plans to conduct the exams. However, there were many representations from parents and even some states were not keen. We are sure a direction will emerge from the court ruling which will definitely be looking at the overall picture.”A second official said a decision on holding NEET and JEE will be taken later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbse-to-apprise-sc-over-board-exams/story-HLyHEQaFVPBnVaGeQzEtTJ.html

We have got 114 positive cases from the samples given by the public voluntarily at 12 centres in the city. In total we got 144 cases in Guwahati without any travel or contact history,” Sarma told journalists in Guwahati.The minister warned that unless the public strictly followed safety measures like wearing masks, sanitizing hands frequently and maintaining social distance, the number of cases in Guwahati could rise exponentially in the next few days.Till now Guwahati had over 100 containment zones. But following detection of the fresh cases, the health department has recommended total lockdown in wards where a sizable number of positive cases are detected. Sarma clarified that the entire city won’t be put under lockdown.After detection of several positive cases without any travel or contact history, the health department had started a campaign on June 15 to test 50,000 samples in the city within two weeks in a bid to ascertain the spread of Covid-19 in Guwahati.Besides focusing on areas where trucks coming from other states operated, 12 sample collection centres were also opened across the city where members of the public could give swab samples voluntarily.Till Monday, nearly 5,000 samples had been collected and results of around 3,000 have been delivered. Sarma said that the target of 50,000 tests would be completed by the end of June.“We had not expected that people would come on their own and give samples, but were surprised to find that on an average nearly 400 people are coming to the 12 centres daily and giving swabs,In a bid to increase screening, from Wednesday 31 sample collection centres would be started in government schools across the city where people would be able to come and give swab samples for testing.“These centres will have a doctor and other healthcare staff and will soon be equipped with TrueNat testing machines so that results can be delivered within hours,” said Sarma.“We expect the number of cases in Guwahati to rise in coming days. At a later stage depending on the number of cases, our quarantine centres would be converted to Covid care facilities for asymptomatic patients and only symptomatic patients will be admitted to hospitals,” he added.Assam has recorded 5,586 Covid-19 positive cases till date.

22-06-2020||India||SC stays CPCB’s Rs 18-lakh fine on NTPC for non-compliance of emission norms||The Supreme Court has stayed an order passed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) imposing a penalty of Rs 18 lakh on National Thermal Power Corporation’s (NTPC) Dadri plant. The country’s largest power producing utility was found to be non-compliant with the new emission norms introduced by the Centre in 2015 and was directed to deposit this penalty every month beginning June, 2020.The NTPC approached the apex Court last week against the CPCB order of May 8 claiming that the pollution regulator failed to acknowledge the proceeding in the air pollution matter (MC Mehta case) where the issue of compliance of the 2015 New Environmental Norms for Thermal Power Plants is still pending. These norms were introduced by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) in order to curb the increasing levels of air pollution in Delhi and surrounding National Capital Region (NCR).Solicitor General Tushar Mehta representing NTPC informed a bench of Justices Arun Mishra and S Abdul Nazeer that the apex court while hearing the MC Mehta case on December 10, 2018 noted the minutes of a meeting conducted by the Union Environment and Power Ministries with the amicus curiae assisting the Court and came to a consensus on allowing NTPC time till December 2021 to comply with the 2015 norms.Amicus curiae and senior advocate Aparajita Singh who was appearing in the matter through video conferencing informed the Court that NTPC has already begun efforts to install Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) in its plants in order to achieve reduced emission levels of sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulate matter.The bench issued notice on NTPC’s application and said, “Recovery so far as regards to NTPC Ltd to remain stayed till the next date of hearing.” The Court posted the next hearing to July last week.On a reading of the May 8 CPCB order, there is no mention of the MC Mehta case proceedings pending in the apex court. However, its decision has been guided by the timelines set by the Ministry of Power directing thermal power plants situated within a 300-kilometre radius of Delhi to comply with the revised norms by December 31, 2019. The CPCB had worked out the penalty figure of Rs 18 lakh based on Dadri project’s non-compliance beginning January 1, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-stays-cpcb-s-rs-18-lakh-fine-on-ntpc-for-non-compliance-of-emission-norms/story-6VViz5vLlLiCCM5DWR5vbO.html

He got really worried as his internal exam was scheduled to be held online for the day.“When I made some calls I came to know about the encounter and postponement of the exams. This is second time that the exam was postponed. Mobile internet was also suspended in south Kashmir on Thursday and Friday after encounters erupted there,” he said.While three terrorists were killed in Zadibal encounter on Sunday, eight terrorists were killed on Thursday and Friday in two separate gun battles in south Kashmir’s Pulwama and Shopian districts. A terrorist was also killed in Kulgam on Saturday. Another encounter erupted in Anantnag on Monday.The intensity of gun battles has increased in the past few months in Kashmir valley. So far at-least 106 terrorists have been killed this year across the valley of which 36 have been killed in June alone particularly in south Kashmir. More gun battles mean more instances of internet suspension in individual districts which means educational institutes have to either take exams of the affected district afresh or reschedule the whole process.A computer science student of Islamic University of Science and Technology (IUST) in Pulwama district said that their internal viva exams were going on online on Thursday when the internet suddenly snapped.“Three students managed to give their viva exams when suddenly the teacher became offline. We were around 80 students waiting for our turns. The whole schedule got disrupted as the internet was restored on Saturday when the exams were held again,” she said.When the lockdown was implemented in mid-March to stop the spread of coronavirus, student communities across the country took advantage of high speed internet to get in touch with their teachers and appeared for online classes. However the student communities in Jammu and Kashmir are an unfortunate lot as first they were cut off for months last year when internet was suspended following the revocation of special status of the region. When the internet was restored in January this year, the authorities decided to ban the high speed internet and allowed only 2G speeds.IUST student Abrar Ahmad, who is doing his B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering, said that the students of the valley suffer a lot due to internet issues.“Already due to 2G, our online classes were in name only. Now our teachers decided to hold our internal exams online which will help them to asses our performance as proper examinations in the pandemic are very risky. But then day in and day out suspension of mobile internet is making it very cumbersome for the education fraternity,” Ahmad said.“On Sunday our exams were scheduled but due to internet suspension that could not be held. Our next paper is on Tuesday, so the university authorities may squeeze in the rescheduled paper a day before or after which makes it very tiresome for us,” he said.When HT attempted to ask government’s secretary for higher education Talat Parvez Rohella about the issue, his phone was switched off. Calls to divisional commissioner Kashmir, Pandurang K Pole did not yield any response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/students-in-kashmir-suffer-as-internet-is-suspended-frequently-during-encounters/story-2wM9WwW59vcKEPQ89LOiTI.html

22-06-2020||India||10 days on, Kedarnath priest protests bare-chested against Char Dham Board||Priests at all Char Dham shrines in Uttarakahand will soon start protests against the state government’s decision to set up the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board, the Devbhoomi Tirtha Purohit Haqhakudhari Mahapanchayat, an association of priests of all the four shrines said Monday.A priest from the Kedarnath shrine already began a solo protest 10 days ago, sitting bare-chested in cold conditions outside the shrine.The Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board was formed last December to manage 51 temples including the Char Dham shrines. The priest community had opposed the move and alleged that they were kept in the dark about the law. They alleged that the government took such a step to sideline them and ensure full government control of temple related issues.In December last year, the Uttarakhand state assembly had passed the Char Dham Shrine Management Board Bill with a small change in its name by replacing the word ‘Shrine’ with ‘Devasthanam’ on the last day of the winter session.Santosh Trivedi, the priest sits outside the Kedarnath temple and meditates as a sign of protest, demanding that the Board should be suspended. The portals of the shrine opened on April 29 this year. The priest community in the state feels that the state government is only eyeing the funds generated by the temples.Vinod Shukla, president of Kedarnath Tirtha Purohit Mahasabha, a priests’ body of the shrine said, “Santosh Trivedi, the tirtha purohit of Kedarnath has been protesting since June 12 against the formation of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board. As a sign of protest, Trivedi meditates thrice a day outside the shrine when prayers are being offered.” Prayers are offered thrice at the shrine which takes approximately four hours.Brijesh Sati, spokesperson of Devbhoomi Tirtha Purohit Haqhakudhari Mahapanchayat, a priests’ body of all the Char Dham shrines said protests against the board will soon start at other shrines also.“The priests of shrines like Gangotri, Yamunotri and Badrinath are discussing on how to step up the protests and soon they will start at those shrines also,” said Sati.The priests have not accepted the formation of the Board and have been protesting since November before it was formed.Ravinath Raman, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board said the priests can protest, but the Board is a government body formed through an Act.“It is their democratic right to protest, so we cannot say anything about this. The Board is a government body made through an Act, so we cannot comment.” said Raman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-days-on-kedarnath-priest-protests-bare-chested-against-char-dham-board/story-WbbXrNQ5iSAL6RGTHnhgoK.html

With India’s coronavirus tally currently at 425,282 cases, Maharashtra remains the worst-hit state by the pandemic, accounting for almost one-third of the country’s total count.The state reported 113 deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll to 6,283Financial capital Mumbai touched 67,586 with 1,098 new infections across the city.With 66 fatalities recorded in the last 24 hours, the city’s death toll climbed to 3,737 as more people succumbed to the deadly virus.A total of 1,962 patients were discharged on Monday across the state, taking the number of recovered patients to 67,706, a health official said.The number of active cases in Maharashtra under treatment now stands at 61,793.In some encouraging news for the state, however, Asia’s largest slum, Mumbai’s Dharavi has managed to flatten the coronavirus curve to a large extent. But after a brief lull of about two weeks the deadly infection was back again with seventeen fresh Covid-19 cases being reported on June 19. Despite reporting new Covid-19 cases, the Union health ministry on Sunday said that due to proactive measures adopted by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the Covid-19 growth rate in Dharavi has dipped to 1.02% in June.Known for being highly congested with eight to ten people living in small shanties, the virus had started spreading swiftly in Dharavi in the month of April. A slew of steps taken by the BMC with regular testing and isolation of Covid-19 positive patients helped the Mumbai slum to curb the spread of the infectious disease largely. Currently, the total number of coronavirus cases in Dharavi stands at 2,158. Barely eight days after recording 3 lakh Covid-19 infections, India on Sunday crossed the four lakh-mark with the biggest single-day spike of 15,413 new patients.The country has a total of 1,74,384 active Covid-19 cases and 237,195 people have been cured of the disease, according to the health ministry. The country’s death toll now stands at 13,699.India has seen a surge of 2,19,926 infections from June 1 till June 21 with Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh among the top five states that have seen a sharp rise in coronavirus cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-count-soars-by-3-721-new-cases-to-over-1-35-lakh-113-more-die/story-eWXk3vFmZRGeyb21kFgPUN.html
22-06-2020||India||Galwan Valley clash: Chinese commanding officer among several killed along LAC||A commanding officer (CO) of a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) unit was among the scores of fatal casualties that China suffered in the June 15 Galwan Valley skirmish along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), people familiar with developments said on Monday.The death of the Chinese commander was confirmed to the Indian side through diplomatic and military channels last week, said one of the persons cited above, asking not to be named.The brutal clash at Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh resulted in 20 Indian deaths, including that of a CO, and the Chinese army possibly suffered more than twice the casualties, as stated by union minister General VK Singh (retd) on Saturday). It was the first deadly conflict between Indian and Chinese soldiers along the contested LAC in 45 years.The Chinese CO’s body was among the bodies exchanged by the two sides after the clash was over on June 16, said the second person cited above.The moment the Indian soldiers realised that their CO, Colonel B Santosh Babu, had fallen they fought against the Chinese soldiers with all their might and killed 16 of them and inflicted life-threatening injuries on scores of others in a fearsome counter attack.The seven-hour deadly conflict involved three staggered clashes and saw the Indian soldiers put up a fierce fight against Chinese troops who had been pulled out of another sector and freshly deployed on the disputed border to carry out the premeditated attack, as reported by HT on Monday. The Indian and Chinese COs were killed in the second and the most fierce round of fighting.The clash involved 600 soldiers from both sides, with the Indians badly outnumbered.Details from the debriefing of Indian soldiers involved in the skirmish reveal the heroism of the Indian troops who fought off numerically superior rivals and the tactics of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.The Indian soldiers were carrying weapons and ammunition but did not open fire as they were following border agreements between the two countries, the government said last week following a political controversy erupted over whether the Indian soldiers were carrying weapons that could have been used to defend themselves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-commanding-officer-killed-in-galwan-valley-clash/story-oRS6OrVIT92GCVIYAGUGhK.html

Two people, including the trailer driver and the operator of the excavator, were injured. The condition of one person is said to be serious, said police. According to Mohammed Asif Khan, station house officer, Munsiyari police station, “The incident happened at around 9 am near Dhapa bend on the road towards the LAC.”“At the time of the incident, there was construction work going on for another bridge near the collapsed one which was not in a good condition. When the trailer came there, the workers warned the driver not to cross it by claiming it will collapse as it can bear the load of only a four-wheeler at a given time. However, the driver tried to cross it, resulting in the accident,” said Khan. The police reached there soon after the incident and rushed the two persons to a nearby hospital with the help of locals. Khan said, “Of the two, the trailer driver - identified as Godhan, a resident of Almora district - is in stable condition while the other identified as Lakhbir Singh, a resident of Punjab, is serious.”The police officer said that during the probe it was found that the trailer was transporting the excavator to a road construction project of Border Roads Organisation (BRO) in the Lilam Valley near the LAC. “After the collapse of the bridge, the area beyond that has been cut off as there is no other way to cross it. The BRO officials have said that they will soon repair the collapsed bridge to resume connectivity in the next 7-8 days after removing the damaged vehicles from the spot,” said Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bridge-near-line-of-actual-control-collapses-into-rivulet-in-uttarakhand/story-Zqhzfly9dD38giz7C30jUL.html

The complaint filed against them by Islamabad Police had accused them of rash driving and possessing fake Pakistani currency but theses charge were denied by New Delhi.Pakistani security agencies had detained the staff members and held them for almost 12 hours, releasing them after Pakistani charge d’affaires Syed Haider Shah was summoned to the external affairs ministry for lodging a strong protest.An official statement issued last week had said the two staff members of the Indian mission were “forcibly abducted by Pakistani agencies…and kept in illegal custody for more than 10 hours” and also “subjected to interrogation, torture and physical assault”.It is believed the two men were withdrawn from Islamabad. Meanwhile, the Indian high commission in Islamabad has announced it will facilitate the return of 748 Indian nationals from Pakistan via the Wagah-Attari land border during June 25-27.A total of 250 Indian nationals will return on June 25 while another 250 will return the following day. The remaining Indian national will be repatriated via the land border crossing on June 27, according to a notification posted on the mission’s website.The Indian nationals being repatriated were asked to make arrangements to reach the Wagah-Attari border crossing.Hundreds of Indians, most of them students or people visiting relatives, were stranded in Pakistan after the Indian government imposed travel restrictions in March to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the absence of flights between the two countries, many people had asked to be allowed to cross over via the land border crossing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-indian-mission-staffers-detained-by-pakistani-agencies-return-via-wagah/story-olAup8z4jGRH69djLlv1ZK.html
22-06-2020||India||How Centre, nudged by PM Modi, made a case for Rath Yatra in Supreme Court||Just about the time when millions of devotees were about to suffer a collective heartbreak over the grim prospect of Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath and his siblings not happening this year, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Monday afternoon allowed the juggernaut of the three deities to roll on the Grand Road of Puri. Reversing its June 18 order - where the court halted the yatra citing public health and citizens’ safety amid a raging coronavirus pandemic - the apex court on Monday allowed the festival minus devotees, who have always been inseparable part of its tradition since centuries, following a change in the stand of the Odisha government. Today’s order was as dramatic as the state government’s initial stand on not letting it happen due to the coronavirus and then doing a complete volte face in the face of public outcry. On social media, the top court’s decision is being hailed as the wish of the Lord prevailing over everyone.While hectic preparations are on to hold the Rath Yatra at Puri on June 23 without the presence of any devotees, the play of politics behind the entire event may be too glaring to miss. While the Odisha BJP unit has been uncharacteristically silent over the Rath Yatra issue, union home minister Amit Shah on Monday indicated that PM Modi nudged him to hold consultations with the Shankaracharya and the King of Puri. “PM Narendra Modi not only understood the sentiments of devotees but also initiated consultations. Last evening, as per the instructions of the PM, I spoke to Gajapati Maharaj Ji (the king of Puri) and the respected Shankaracharya ji of Puri and sought their views on the Yatra. “This morning, on PM’s instructions, I also spoke to the Solicitor General. It makes me, as well as crores of devotees across India happy that PM not only understood the sentiment of the devotees but also initiated consultations which ensured that the great traditions of our land are observed,” tweeted Shah in Odia.The home minister’s tweet that his government facilitated placing the matter in front of a vacation bench of the Supreme Court is an indication of the importance that the party places on Odisha. Though the state elections in Odisha are four years away and the panchayat polls more than one and half years away, the Naveen Patnaik government’s flip-flop over Rath Yatra gave the opportunity to BJP to make some more inroads into the mind of Odia electorate. The party over the last few years has been unsuccessfully trying to appropriate the Jagannath culture and blend it into their overall Hindutva campaign. Puri has been central to its overall political theme. Last year, the BJP was toying with the idea of letting Modi fight from the Puri Lok Sabha constituency but later allowed its national spokesperson Sambit Patra to contest the seat. Patra lost the seat to BJD’s lawyer-turned-politician Pinaki Mishra by a whisker. In early February, a month before Covid-19 lockdown started, home minister Shah in a political rally in Bhubaneswar spoke how Odisha is like his second home as Lord Jagannath has kept “showering his blessings on both Gujarat and Odisha.”Political analysts said the BJP first tested the waters last month when the ministry of home affairs allowed construction of the three chariots on Grand Road at a time when a strict national lockdown was in place that prohibited any construction activity.“By allowing construction of the chariots, the Centre wanted to show that it never came in the way of the Rath Yatra, the biggest festival of Odisha, even during the time of a pandemic. It ensured that the BJD would never be able to accuse it of holding up the festival,” said Gyana Ranjan Swain, political science professor of Ravenshaw University in Cuttack.Though it was expected that the Patnaik government would be able to hold the festival minus devotees, the plan began to go awry by May-end when suddenly the number of Covid-19 cases in the state saw a steep rise in numbers due to the influx of migrant workers. From less than 15 districts by May first week, the entire state of Odisha was soon in the clutches of the pandemic by May end making things difficult for the government. The rising number of cases outside the quarantine centres too fuelled the fears of local transmission of the virus. The officials were decidedly nervous over the possibility of a full scale community transmission once lakhs of devotees thronged the temple town of Puri on the day of Rath Yatra.So when a little-known NGO went to the Supreme Court, allegedly with some backing from sections of government seeking stay on Rath Yatra due to the pandemic, the Patnaik government played along and reeled out figures of a million devotees congregating in Puri. With SC halting the Yatra on June 18, the BJD did not account for the massive outrage among lakhs of devotees as well as the temple priests who felt shortchanged by the government. Many felt the government could have told the apex court that it can organise the Rath Yatra the way it conducted the Snana Purnima festival, an important festival preceding the car festival, in the first week of June. The BJP’s image as a saviour of the biggest festival of Odisha may have come unexpectedly, but it nicely fits into its grand scheme of things it has for Odisha. By helping the juggernaut to roll on June 23, the party perhaps thinks its own caravan in Odisha would get a push.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-centre-nudged-by-pm-modi-made-a-case-for-rath-yatra-in-supreme-court/story-RkisFIzBAHlXtToGe51AWP.html

On Monday, the state reported 138 fresh cases taking the tally 3,310, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s office.In the last three days, the state has reported more than 100 Covid-19 cases daily. The government is worried because a large number of expatriates from Persian Gulf countries are expected in the coming days. More than 80 per cent of recent Covid-19 cases in the state were expatriates or people who came from other states. Out of the tally of 3,310 total cases, 1,540 people are in hospitals while 22 have died so far.“There is no room for any complacency now. As more people return to the state numbers will go up.

22-06-2020||India||India condemns abduction of Sikh community leader in Afghanistan||India on Monday condemned the abduction of a Sikh community leader in Afghanistan and said the targeting and persecution of minorities by “terrorists at the behest of their external supporters” is a matter of concern.Nedan Singh was kidnapped by unidentified persons in Tsamkani district of Paktia province in eastern Afghanistan last week. He was employed as a helper at a gurdwara.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said, “We strongly condemn the abduction of Mr Nedan Singh, a leader of the Hindu and Sikh community of Afghanistan by terrorists.“The targeting and persecution of minority community members by terrorists at the behest of their external supporters is a matter of grave concern.”Srivastava didn’t name any country for being behind the abduction though his remarks pointed the finger at Pakistan, which has long been accused by India of backing terror groups active in Afghanistan.“India is in touch with the government of Afghanistan for ensuring the safety, security and well-being of the minority community in Afghanistan. We hope that the government of Afghanistan would be able to secure safe and early release of Mr Nedan Singh,” Srivastava added.The abduction comes months after nearly 30 members of the Sikh minority were killed in a terror attack on a place of worship in Kabul on March 25. That attack was claimed by the Islamic State though officials have said the Haqqani Network and Lashkar-e-Taiba were linked to the deadly assault.Afghanistan’s Sikh minority has dwindled to a few hundred families after being targeted by the Taliban and other groups in recent decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-condemns-abduction-of-sikh-community-leader-in-afghanistan/story-uhodgUCQAumOOcPdVfM8lJ.html
22-06-2020||India||No threat to Manipur govt, crisis will be resolved in 2-3 days: Himanta Biswa Sarma||Himanta Biswa Sarma, the convenor of the North-East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led front of anti-Congress forces in the northeast, said on Monday that there is no threat to the N. Biren Singh-led coalition government in Manipur and the ongoing political crisis in the border state would blow over the next two-three days.The BJP-led coalition in Manipur was reduced to a minority last week after three party MLAs resigned and six other MLAs—four from National People’s Party (NPP), one from Trinamool Congress (TMC) and an Independent legislator - withdrew support to it.“The situation is more or less under control. We are consulting all our MLAs and things will be resolved nicely. There is nothing to worry,” Sarma, a senior minister in Assam’s BJP-led government, told journalists in Guwahati.Sarma had played a crucial role in formation of the first BJP-led government in Manipur in 2017 when the party had secured 21 seats in the 60-member house even though the Congress had won 28.However, it was able to form government with support of other NEDA constituents--NPP, Naga People’s Front (NPF)—and MLAs from TMC, Lok Janshakti Party and an Independent legislator.On Sunday, Sarma along with NPP national president and CM Sangma had flown to Manipur capital Imphal on a chartered flight to hold discussions and bury the differences among the coalition partners.“All discussions took place in a very positive manner. You will see good results in the next two-three days. There’s absolutely no worry. I’ll visit Imphal again on Tuesday,” Sarma said.Speculations have been rife that Singh might step down in a bid to bring back the dissident NPP lawmakers into the coalition government, as they had resigned complaining against the CM’s style of functioning.Sarma, however, rubbished the speculations about the leadership change.“As the Speaker Yumnam Khemchand Singh had disqualified some MLAs, there could be some difference in the ‘architecture’ of the coalition, but more or less we’re continuing with the spirit of the NEDA and the NDA. All complaints and grievances will be addressed. There’s no question of any leadership change at this point in time,” said Sarma.The BJP’s strength in the assembly has been reduced to 18 after the resignation of three of its MLAs. However, it still enjoys the support of four NPF MLAs and an LJP legislator, taking the coalition’s tally to 23.Rival Congress , on the other hand, has 20 MLAs and also has the backing of four NPP MLAs and a lawmaker from the TMC and the Independent.In total, the Congress-led newly formed Secular Progressive Front (SPF) has 26 MLAs.Manipur Assembly’s strength has been reduced to 52 because of a few disqualifications and resignations.BJP’s candidate Sanajaoba Leishemba won the Rajya Sabha election last Friday securing 28 votes to Congress candidate T Mangibabu’s 24, despite the ruling party’s reduced strength, raising hopes of saving the coalition government.Meanwhile, NPP’s legislature party leader L Jayantakumar told journalists in Imphal that despite Himanta Biswa Sarma’s attempts at convincing them to return to the BJP-led coalition, they didn’t succumb.“Sarma tried his best to convince us but we never succumbed to his pressure. Our national president Conrad Sangma, who was present in the meeting, remained silent as left the decision on the what we should do to the 4 party MLAs,” Jayantakumar said during a press interaction of the SPF, which was attended by Congress MLAs as well.Earlier in the day Chief Minister N Biren Singh met Governor Najma Heptullah. In a tweet, he informed that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the RS elections and other issues of the state.“Why is the BJP running away from a floor test? If NEDA or BJP respects constitution then they should face a floor test in the House,” said Manipur Congress spokesperson Ningombam Bupenda Meitei.The Congress has met the Governor twice in the past few days seeking a floor test to prove majority of the N Biren Singh government.(With inputs from Sobhapati Samom in Imphal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-threat-to-manipur-govt-crisis-will-be-resolved-in-2-3-days-himanta-biswa-sarma/story-gOKvZZPn1nZqrZf1CzR0GI.html

The entire nation is delighted by the Supreme Court’s decision to ensure the Rath Yatra goes on,” Shah said after the top court’s judgment permitting the festival to take place.Earlier, the home minister also spoke to Gajapati Maharaj and the Shankaracharya of Puri to know their views on the Rath Yatra.ALSO READ | On Rath Yatra, Supreme Court says will let temple committee, Odisha decide“Considering the urgency and importance of the matter, it was placed in front of a vacation bench of the Supreme Court and the hearing took place this afternoon, which paved the way for the important decision by the SC. Congratulations to the people of Odisha,” Shah tweeted soon after the hearing on the issue. Four days after staying the historic and legendary Lord Jagannath’s Rath Yatra at Puri, the Supreme Court on Monday indicated it would allow the event, which is scheduled to start tomorrow, saying the court cannot ‘micro-manage’ the rituals and left it to the Odisha government, the Centre and the Lord Jagannath temple management to deal with the issue of social distancing and crowds of devotees..A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde was told by the Odisha government that it will coordinate with the temple management and the Centre to ensure that things run smoothly during the Rath Yatra.The festival, held in the coastal state of Odisha is usually attended by lakhs of people from around the world. The court ordered the state government to ensure compliance with health protocols in view of the coronavirus pandemic.Earlier, while hearing a PIL filed by NGO ‘Odisha Vikash Parishad’ the top court on June 18 had said that in the interest of public health and safety, this year’s Puri Rath Yatra cannot be allowed and that “Lord Jagannath won’t forgive us if we allow” it. A day after the order was passed; a few applications were filed in the top court seeking recall and modification of its order.These applications, including those filed by the Jagannath Sanskruti Jana Jagarana Manch and BJP leader Sambit Patra, urged the apex court to allow the Rath Yatra with certain restrictions in place due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/entire-nation-is-delighted-by-sc-s-nod-for-rath-yatra-in-puri-amit-shah/story-MhtuZb2p1WS5glExk5peKL.html

But by late in the night, we got a call from the hospital that she had passed away,” Nishat said.The family members were told that Begum Jani had tested negative for Covid-19 but when they went to the hospital the following morning, they were told that there was some mistake in the test report, as there was another patient of the same name in the hospital who got admitted June 17.The hospital authorities told Begum Jani’s family members that the sample from her body was sent for testing again and till the receipt of the report, her body would be kept in the mortuary.“For the three days, we were made to run around the hospital for the test report and finally, on Sunday night, we were told she had tested positive. As such, the body would not be given to the family members but would be buried as per Covid-19 rules,” Nishat said.The issue was brought to light on Monday by Mohd Amjadullah Khan, president of Majlis-e-Bachao-Tehreek who tweeted about the mix up of reports in the OGH.He said because of such mistakes there was every possibility that Covid-19 negative patients were disposed of by the GHMC authorities, while bodies Covid-19 positive patients were handed over to the relatives for last rites which was dangerous.OGH superintendent Dr B Nagender said such incidents rarely happen due to miscommunication and were addressed as soon as they were brought to the notice of the hospital authorities.“We come across some patients with the same name, coming from the same area for testing. When test reports are obtained from the lab at Osmania Medical College, sometimes, test reports of one patient might have been given to the family members of another patient due to miscommunication as the names sound similar,” he said.Nagender, however, said enough care would be taken while handing over the bodies to the relatives, which would be done only after cross-checking the telephone numbers, Aadhar cards and other details.He acknowledged that there was delay in obtaining test reports from the lab and attributed it to the growing number of cases in Hyderabad. “We are making the best efforts to get the results as early as possible,” the OGH superintendent said.A similar mistake took place at the OGH on Sunday, too, when family members of a woman who was under treatment at the hospital were told that she had died due to Covid-19, though they were told a day before that she was recovering fast and was healthy.When the family members reached the hospital, they saw that Meherunissa was present in her ward and they lodged a complaint with the police. During the inquiry, it was revealed that another patient by the same name died due to Covid-19 and the hospital staff called up the family members of the other patient who was recovering. The hospital authorities apologised to the family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-hospital-declares-woman-covid-19-free-then-says-she-died-of-it/story-vh1SlEf768lt5Su6xDw2vL.html

There is an orange category warning for Assam, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura along with some parts of sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Bihar for these three days for very heavy to extremely heavy rains, IMD said on Monday.

Its eastern end is very likely to shift northward from June 24. The convergence of strong moist southerlies and southwesterly winds from the Bay of Bengal over northeast and east India is likely to make conditions conducive for extremely heavy rains, IMD said.There is also a cyclonic circulation over north interior Odisha, which is likely to move northwestwards during next three days. “Under the influence of the above meteorological features, conditions are becoming favourable for further advance of monsoon into some more parts of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand during the next 24 hours and into the entire Western Himalayan Region, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, most parts of Punjab…during the subsequent 48 hours.” IMD’s bulletin said.Due to the approaching monsoon, there is also likely to be widespread rains over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and the Western Himalayan region from June 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/intense-monsoon-spell-likely-over-ne-india-imd/story-WVK4Xnj0aqXnRMfYS2W96I.html

On Monday, the Congress leader wanted to know why is China busy praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi amid tension in bilateral ties and fight over the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Galwan area. “China killed our soldiers. China took our land. Then, why is China praising Mr Modi during this conflict?” asked Gandhi, tagging a news report detailing how Chinese social media welcomed the PM’s comments on the border meet at Friday’s all-party meet. China killed our soldiers.China took our land.Then, why is China praising Mr Modi during this conflict? pic.twitter.com/iNV8c1cmalAt the meeting called to discuss the border situation with China, the PM categorically pointed out that “neither has anyone entered Indian territory, nor is anyone present in Indian territory currently, and nor is any Indian post captured”. This led to howls of protest from the opposition seeking an explanation as to how the soldiers died on June 15. A day later, on Saturday, in a clarification, the Prime Minister’s Office said Modi’s remarks had focused on the June 15 face-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers at Galwan that led to the loss of lives of 20 Indian soldiers.“The Prime Minister’s observations that there was no Chinese presence on our side of the LAC (Line of Actual Control) pertained to the situation as a consequence of the bravery of our armed forces,” the statement said.Rahul Gandhi shared The Hindu’s report which, in turn, quoted China’s state-run Global Times report quoting PM’s no one has entered Indian territory comment. The same comment, the paper noted, was then picked up by other outlets and shared on social media as well. Quoting a Chinese military expert, the paper said: “The PM’s comments on the armed forces being allowed to take necessary steps was “a show of strength for domestic audiences to appease the Indian masses and boost the Indian troops’ morale”.On Sunday, Rahul Gandhi emerged as one of the top trends on Twitter when he, in a post, said “Narendra Modi is actually Surender Modi”.The apparent reference was to Indian territory being ceded to the Chinese. A top retired army commander, who didn’t want to be identified, told HT that China had already achieved what it set out to achieve – gaining control over Galwan Valley and the strategic feature Finger 4 near Pangong Tso where a significant Chinese build up has taken place over the last six weeks.The government, however, denies any such claim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-wonders-why-is-china-praising-pm-modi-amid-border-conflict/story-JMOB0DUHlT75ym5EMwDXMP.html

China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet, while India contests it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-initiated-incident-in-galwan-valley-china-again-blames-new-delhi/story-Bu51EBSvw1ZoBqjEIJJWBI.html
22-06-2020||India||Pollutants enter Delhi via three distinct air corridors during winters: Study||Scientists have identified at least three distinct air corridors that act as carriers of pollutants to Delhi from places far and wide, including Nepal in the east, and Iran and Pakistan in the north-west, during winter, when the national capital’s air quality is at its worst.The study -- the first real-time source apportionment analysis of Delhi, as the data was collected once every 30 minutes during two successive winters in 2018 and 2019 -- was conducted by a team of 15 researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kanpur; IIT-Delhi; Laboratory of Atmospheric Chemistry (LAC), Switzerland; Physical Research Laboratory; Ahmedabad; and Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l’environnement, France.The samples from the study were collected from the campus of IIT-Delhi.“Contrary to the popular belief, we’ve found that pollutants enter Delhi through three distinct corridors during winter. While the north-west corridor primarily brings pollutants from Pakistan, Punjab and Haryana; Uttar Pradesh makes up for the north-east and the east; and Nepal, too, accounts for the east,” said SN Tripathi, head, civil engineering department, IIT-Kanpur, and one of the authors of the study.A joint study -- conducted by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) two years ago -- had shown that 64% of Delhi’s pollution is extraneous.Around 34% of the pollutants traced their origins to the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) and 18% from the north-western parts of the country. While 13% of pollutants were from other parts of south Asia and beyond.The latest study showed that in each of these corridors, some specific chemicals were found in the air in much higher quantity, which suggested that certain industries were the worst polluters.“Winds coming from the east were found to be carrying metals such as lead, copper and cadmium because of the presence of lead-based industries in the region. Similarly, elements such as selenium, bromine and chlorine were found to be predominant in winds blowing from the north-west sector. While selenium and bromine were found in industries dealing with drugs and chemicals among others, and chlorine emitted from brick kilns, landfill sites that burnt garbage and other factories,” he added.The scientists detected at least 35 elements of which 26 were found in higher quantity than the rest, making up nearly one-fourth of the total mass of the coarser particles, known as particulate matter 10 (PM10). “The study was a real-time source apportionment analysis, as the data was collected once every 30 minutes. We also found that Delhi is in the grips of pollution peaks twice daily. The first peak occurs between 3am and 8am the next one around 10pm,” said Dilip Ganguly, associate professor, Centre for Atmospheric Studies, IIT-Delhi.Dr. Prashant Gargava, member-secretary, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the country’s apex pollution control body, said: “This was a research & development (R&D) project, which was commissioned by the CPCB. It has provided some high-resolution data. We’ll analyse the data after we receive a complete report to utilise them for further policymaking decisions.”“The study could open new vistas for air quality management in the country. Such studies will help us determine the presence of toxicity of each pollutant in the air and its harmful side effects. We need to conduct similar studies throughout the year to get a sense of the impact of pollution on Delhi,” said D. Saha, ex-head, air quality laboratory, CPCB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scientists-identify-three-distinct-corridors-through-which-pollutants-enter-delhi-during-winters/story-QSqsDYU2kDQyRSAScGwjiL.html
22-06-2020||India||China’s blame narrative continues, says India ‘initiated’ Galwan clash||India initiated the violent clash in eastern Ladakh last week, China said on Monday continuing to blame New Delhi for the face-off in Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh, which left 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of Chinese troops dead in a vicious hand-to-hand brawl on the night of June 15.“The rights and wrongs of this incident are very clear,” Beijing said in a statement to the Hindustan Times.At the regular briefing on Monday, the Chinese foreign ministry also refused to share any details of the ongoing military-to-military talks in the region, and, once again, stalled a query on the number of casualties that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) suffered.“China and India are in communication with each other to resolve the situation on the ground through diplomatic and military channels. I have no information to release on that,” ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said.Zhao’s comment was in response to a query on Indian minister V K Singh’s statement on Sunday in which he said China could have lost double the number of soldiers India lost in the violent clash.The Chinese government has refused to reveal PLA’s casualty figures for a week now though Chinese state-controlled media has said both sides suffered casualties during the clash.In a separate statement to the Hindustan Times on Monday, the spokesperson’s office reiterated its stance on the cause of the clash.“The Chinese has repeatedly stated that the rights and wrongs of this incident are very clear and initiated by the Indian side, and the responsibility does not rest with China,” the spokesperson’s office said in a written statement in Mandarin to the Hindustan Times on Monday.“China always strictly abides by the agreements signed between the two countries and carries out patrols and duties on the Chinese side of the line of actual control (LAC),” the statement said.The statement added that Beijing hopes that the two sides will “…earnestly implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, step up communication and coordination on properly handling the border situation and jointly safeguard peace and tranquility of the border area”.The latest statement from the Chinese foreign ministry continues from the so-called step-by-step account of the clash it released late on Friday night.As a background to the account – which has been rubbished by India – the ministry claimed “…Galwan Valley is located on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control in the west section of the China-India boundary.”“For many years, the Chinese border troops have been patrolling and on duty in this region. Since April this year, the Indian border troops have unilaterally and continuously built roads, bridges and other facilities at the LAC in the Galwan Valley,” the statement said.“Shockingly, on the evening of June 15, India’s front-line troops, in violation of the agreement reached at the commander-level meeting, once again crossed the LAC for deliberate provocation when the situation in the Galwan Valley was already easing, and even violently attacked the Chinese officers and soldiers who went there for negotiation, thus triggering fierce physical conflicts and causing casualties.”Soon after China released this statement on Friday, India rejected the claims of China’s sovereignty over Galwan Valley, calling them “exaggerated and untenable”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-s-blame-narrative-continues-says-india-initiated-galwan-clash/story-mQQnpVKeDpOzxqhUo7bGbP.html

The Yatra is scheduled to begin on June 23, this leaves the state government with half a day to come up with a plan.Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik, shortly after the breather given by the court, has called for a Rath Yatra preparatory meeting in Bhubaneswar. The Centre and the Odisha government had petitioned the top court against stopping the Yatra, citing years of tradition and faith.“It is a matter of faith for crores. If Lord Jagannath will not come out tomorrow, he cannot come out for 12 years as per traditions,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the court.The famous Yatra, running uninterrupted for 285 years, the court was requested be allowed this year without public participation.The apex court had earlier cancelled the Yatra, underscoring public health and safety of citizens amid a raging coronavirus pandemic. The court added that “Lord Jagannath won’t forgive us if we allow” it.“In the interest of public health and safety of citizens, we restrain the state from holding the Rath Yatra and associated activities. We direct that there shall be no Rath Yatra and associated activities this year”, the CJI SA Bobde headed bench had ordered last week.Three heavily built wooden chariots of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra are traditionally pulled by thousands of devotees over a distance of three kilometres twice during the nine-day festival of the Trinity at Puri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-rath-yatra-supreme-court-says-will-let-temple-committee-odisha-govt-decide/story-5CfuOB6T9F3Lqvo8dRYt5N.html

A fun series by photographer Guru Charan shows the superhero chopping onions and washing clothes! If the guy that can leap across continents can take these responsibilities, so can you!The toy photographer says, “I travelled from Bengaluru to my village Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh for a function and got stuck here when the lockdown was announced. My 7-month’s old toy sets came to my rescue and I started shooting these incredible heroes with my kid’s clothes.”Some days back, the toymaker Mattel had also launched #ThankYouHeroes collection which included 16 action figures - four each of doctors, nurses, EMTs and delivery drivers in varying genders and skin tones.The world has been honouring healthcare heroes but this tribute is a tad different as it has ‘Hulk’. Guru says,”This is my small tribute to all people who are working at home and ensuring that everything works smoothly. While shooting these heroes, I realised Hulk was the most sturdy toy among all the other toys. So I thought of shooting him with my uncle’s lungi as well.”The 33-year old says, “After much introspection, I came to a realisation that with the lockdown, even the superheroes at home would be doing the same household chores which all of us have been doing. Life for all has become about sweeping the floor, washing and ironing the clothes, cooking and entertaining kids. For Hulk, it is also about staying at home and staying safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-hulk-on-your-side-you-re-worrying-about-covid-19/story-Sc7tCU8fjD5zC8zSewFrzI.html

They’re writing to MEA after the monsoon has arrived. The entire northern part of state is in danger of getting flooded,” ANI quoted Tejashwi Yadav as saying after the state’s minister for water resources Sanjay Jha said he will sound out the ministry of external affairs about Nepal’s obstruction to flood prevention-related works.Jha had warned that if the issue is not addressed timely then a major part of the state will be flooded.“Our local engineers and DM are in talks with concerned authorities and now I’ll write a letter to the Ministry of External Affairs, over the current situation. If this issue isn’t addressed timely, then a major part of Bihar will be flooded,” Jha said according to ANI.This situation on the Indo-Nepal border has been tense after the country laid claim to Indian territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura in Uttarakhand.Earlier this month, the Nepalese Parliament passed a constitutional amendment to show the disputed areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepal.On June 12, an Indian man was killed and four others were injured after Nepalese police allegedly fired indiscriminately on them at the border near Sitamarhi district in Bihar.The firing took place after a clash between the Indians and personnel of Nepal police at the Lalbandi-Janki Nagar border in Pipra Parsain panchayat under Sonebarsha police station of the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tejashwi-yadav-blames-bihar-govt-as-flood-threat-looms-amid-border-dispute-with-nepal/story-zrZkw7ivY16m2CE9wSxE2J.html
22-06-2020||India||Safoora Zargar was one of main conspirators, pregnancy no ground for bail: Delhi Police tells court||Delhi Police informed the Delhi high court on Monday that Safoora Zargar, charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for her alleged role in the northeast Delhi riots, was part of a conspiracy to use any means to cause death and injury to people. The police made its submission in a reply to the court, which will hear the matter again on Tuesday. Zargar, a MPhil student of Jamia Millia Islamia, was arrested on April 10 for allegedly conspiring with other persons to instigate and start riots in northeast Delhi. At least 53 people died and 400 others were injured in the riots in February. In a status report, Delhi Police said that based on an investigation, a case was clearly made out from the statements of witnesses. While describing Zargar as one of the “main conspirators and the instigator”, police said the statements of witnesses were allegedly corroborated by her admissions and “extensive documentary evidence”. Opposing her bail application, police said Zargar and other accused were allegedly involved in a “web of actions animated by unlawful object of creating terror and disaffection”.Police told the court that Zargar’s “protestations of innocence are phony; her actions are neither licit nor legitimate and she is clearly culpable of criminal wrongs of grave magnitude deserving no indulgence from the court”. Many student groups across Delhi have held protests seeking Zargar’s release. Students bodies and activists have accused Delhi Police of launching a witch hunt against student activists, especially those who took part in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Zargar earlier told the court she was only part of the protests and denied the police allegations. Delhi Police submitted the status report after Zargar approached the court, seeking bail on the ground that she is more than four months pregnant and has severe medical complications. Replying to this, police said that their “record reveals a sinister stratagem” and Zargar was not only disposed towards “creating turmoil to severely undermine public order and imperil national security but erode and frustrate the civil compact which holds our polity together”.Police said that prima facie, a case has been made against Zargar after her WhatsApp chats were analysed by the investigating agency.The investigating agency said Zargar is not entitled to bail on the ground of pregnancy as the law does not make any distinction in this regard. Police told the court that Delhi’s jails have had many pregnant inmates. They said in that in the past 10 years, 39 deliveries have taken place inside prison.“It is stated that the law unambiguously contemplates provisions to deal with pregnant criminals, which itself indicates that the law permits use of sanction against this class of offenders. The severity of offence is in no manner mitigated by the factum of pregnancy, the accused is not the only pregnant accused to be entitled to any preferential treatment and there is enough precedence available in law not only of the arrest of the pregnant accused and their detention but even of delivery in prison….,” police said.Police earlier said that Zargar, currently being held in Tihar Jail, had allegedly blocked a road near Jafrabad Metro station during the anti-CAA protests and instigated people, which led to riots in the area. On June 4, a city court dismissed her bail plea, stating that “right of speech and expression and for that matter protest or demonstration, is not an absolute right and subject to reasonable restrictions under the Indian Constitution”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/safoora-zargar-was-one-of-main-conspirators-pregnancy-no-ground-for-bail-delhi-police-tells-court/story-4mY5SWUL4vW1P2EBmpjLiI.html

In a message posted on Twitter, Nadda said, “Please stop insulting of forces repeatedly, questioning their valour. You did this post the air strikes and surgical strikes. Please understand the true meaning of national unity, especially in such times.It’s never too late to improve.” Dear Dr. Singh and Congress Party,Please stop insulting our forces repeatedly, questioning their valour. You did this post the air strikes and surgical strikes. Please understand the true meaning of national unity, especially in such times. It’s never too late to improve.The tweet was a reaction to a statement by Singh about the violent face-off between Indian and the Chinese troops in Ladakh on June 15 in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. Singh said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should always be mindful of the implications of his words, a reference to the controversy stocked by Modi’s comments at a meeting of all political parties on Friday. The former prime minister also said the government must rise to the occasion to ensure justice for Col B Santhosh Babu and the 19 other soldiers killed in action. The BJP reacted by accusing the Congress of politicising the issue.“One only wishes that Dr Singh was as worried about Chinese designs when, as PM, he abjectly surrender hundred square kilometres of India’s land to China. He presided over 600 incursions made by China between 2010 to 2013!” Nadda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stop-repeatedly-insulting-the-security-forces-and-questioning-their-valour-nadda-to-manmohan-singh/story-8E2HjDn3UvqbBVPpIMSXzN.html

And notwithstanding her maintaining stealth and secrecy about her real designs the available circumstantial evidence clearly demonstrates that a protestation of innocence is phony, her actions are neither licit nor legitimate and she is clearly culpable of criminal wrongs or grave magnitude deserving no indulgence from this court,” the status report said.“It is also extremely crucial to note here that direct evidence is not always available of a conspiratorial design and mere absence of a contemporaneous record does not even remotely suggest the absence of a case against the applicant/ accused because she stands clearly implicated by the evidence which stands unearthed by the investigation which is continuing even now and further trails of criminality is being unearthed,” it added.The status report said that there is substantial cause for the arrest of the applicant and added that there are grave and compelling reasons that she remains in custody.“Unless evidence in rebuttal is presented (which can only be at trial) she cannot claim to be innocent of the acquisition made against her, as alleged or otherwise, in her petition,” Delhi Police said in the status report.Safoora Zargar had moved the High Court challenging an order of a trial court in Delhi, which had dismissed her bail application.In the mid of February, the accused had allegedly planned to observe protests in various parts of north-east Delhi. She also took part in a protest and blocked a road near a Jafrabad metro station.Later, violence had broken out between groups supporting and opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which led to the deaths of at least 53 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/safoora-zargar-created-turmoil-imperiled-national-security-police-on-bail-plea-in-delhi-violence-case/story-WLHVnQv3QCl5tWulUPXa4J.html

Also read: ‘Fighting 2 wars against China, will win them both’ - Arvind Kejriwal on Covid-19 fightHere are the highlights from Kejriwal’s address: • We are trying to control coronavirus from spreading in the national capital at the same time trying to arrange facilities for those who contract the virus. • Our administration is constantly in touch with those who are getting treated for Covid-19 at home, guiding them on what to do next.• The administration of oxygen is very critical in Covid-19 patients when their oxygen levels drop or when they feel breathless. If patients receive oxygen in time, many patients can be saved. For this purpose, we will provide pulse oximeters to measure oxygen levels every few hours. • Patients in home-isolation can monitor their oxygen level and in case of drop, they can call on a number that we will provide and our team will immediately visit and administer oxygen to the patient. The patient will be rushed to the hospital if there is a requirement. • At present, Delhi has nearly 25,000 active cases of coronavirus while around 33,000 people have recovered from the contagion. • Around 6,000 people are currently in hospitals getting treated for coronavirus while nearly 12,000 are under home quarantine and getting treated for Covid-19. •Just a week back, Delhi had 24,000 active cases of coronavirus which means that fresh 1,000 cases have been reported. It indicates that while new cases are coming up, people are also getting cured from the disease. Seems like the situation is stabilizing. • We have more than tripled the rate of our Covid-19 testing in the past days. From around 5,000 tests per day, the figure has gone up to 18,000 tests. • We have taken strict action against unscrupulous labs who were showing incorrect test results. They have directed to work in a fair manner and in full capacity. • With the help of the Central government, rapid tests have also started in the national capital. I feel people should not feel any problems in getting tested for Covid-19 now. Coronavirus cases in Delhi now inch toward the 60,000-mark. The national capital has 59,746 positive cases with 33,013 recovered patients and 2,175 fatalities.

During the UPA years saw abject strategic and territorial surrender without a fight. Time and again belittles our forces,” Nadda said on Twitter. Dr. Manmohan Singh belongs to the same party which: Helplessly surrendered over 43,000 KM of Indian territory to the Chinese!During the UPA years saw abject strategic and territorial surrender without a fight.Time and again belittles our forces.He went on: “One only wishes that Dr Singh was as worried about Chinese designs when, as PM, he abjectly surrendered hundreds of square kilometres of India’s land to China. He presided over 600 incursions made by China between 2010 to 2013!”“Dr Manmohan Singh can certainly share his wisdom on many subjects but the responsibilities of the office of the Prime Minister isn’t one of them. UPA personified systematic institutional erosion of that office, combined with disrespect for our armed forces. NDA has reversed that!” the BJP chief said in his third tweet.And finally, he said: “Dear Dr Singh and Congress Party, please stop insulting our forces repeatedly, questioning their valour. You did this post the air strikes and surgical strikes. Please understand the true meaning of national unity, especially in such times.

Please understand the true meaning of national unity, especially in such times.

It has questioned if the Chinese have captured parts of Indian territory.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said at an all-party meeting called on the issue that there are no Chinese troops on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and no Indian posts have been captured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/presided-over-600-incursions-bjp-chief-nadda-hits-back-at-manmohan-singh-for-ladakh-face-off-remarks/story-SGUfC61hNwBSCVgynlFBJO.html

The accident took place at about 2 am on Monday, the police said.The accident took place as the truck lost balance and came on the wrong side of the road, crossing the divider, the police further said. The injured are being treated at SN Hospital in Agra.“The accident took place at 2 am on Monday when the truck was coming from Lucknow towards Agra. It appears that driver either slept while driving or for other reason could not control the truck which struck the divider and came on wrong side - on road towards Lucknow - and turned turtle. A bus coming from Delhi and heading towards Lucknow collided with the truck,” said Pradeep Kumar, the in-charge of Doki police station in Agra district.“The person who was killed is either the driver or the cleaner of the truck. About 14 passengers of the bus got injured when it turned and fell towards railing alongside the ExpreswWay,” said Kumar.“Out of the 14 injured, six were admitted at emergency ward of SN Medical College and Hospital of Agra and are under treatment. Two of them had major injuries and were out of danger. The dead body from the truck was removed and sent for post-mortem,” he added.The police added that the truck has been removed and road cleared for traffic movement.Since the lockdown relaxations have come into force, traffic has increased on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway and this was the third accident in three consecutive days on 302 kilometre long road.On Saturday, five members of a family were killed when their car rammed into truck near Naseerpur village in Firozabad district.On Sunday, a private bus from Gorakhpur heading towards Jaipur collided with the railing on the side of the Expressway leaving four injured.On Monday, a truck driver was killed when a bus collided with it in Doki area of Agra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-killed-more-than-dozen-injured-after-bus-collides-with-truck-near-agra/story-aqkpfajBTt2WWmsarcw3QI.html
22-06-2020||India||Centre moves SC, seeks nod for Puri Rath Yatra without public participation||The Centre on Monday told the Supreme Court that Lord Jagannath’s Rath Yatra in Puri can be allowed to be held this year without public participation in view of the coronavirus pandemic, saying the “tradition of centuries may not be stopped”. The Odisha government also supported the Centre’s stand in the apex court, which is likely to hear the plea seeking modification of its June 18 order staying this year’s Puri Rath Yatra due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“It is a matter of faith for crores. If Lord Jagannath will not come out tomorrow, he cannot come out for 12 years as per traditions,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who mentioned the matter before a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra, said.Mehta said that besides maintaining precautions, the state government can impose curfew for a day.“All ‘sebayats’ and ‘pandas’ who have tested negative (for Covid-19) can participate in rituals as may be decided by HH Shri Shankaracharya. People may not congregate and seek blessings on TV during live telecast. Raja of Puri and the temple committee may supervise arrangements of these rituals,” Mehta told the bench.The Puri Rath Yatra, which is attended by lakhs of people from across the world, is scheduled from June 23.The apex court had on June 18 said that in the interest of public health and safety of citizens, this year’s Puri Rath Yatra cannot be allowed and that “Lord Jagannath won’t forgive us if we allow” it. A day after the order was passed, some applications were filed in the top court seeking recall and modification of its order. The modification applications filed earlier are already listed today before a single judge bench of Justice S Ravindra Bhat.These applications, including the one filed by ‘Jagannath Sanskruti Jana Jagarana Manch’, have urged the court to allow the Rath Yatra.While the Rath Yatra festival, held over 10-12 days with lakhs of people participating, was scheduled for June 23, the ‘Bahuda Jatra’ (return car festival) was fixed for July 1.Three heavily-built wooden chariots of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra are traditionally pulled by thousands of devotees over a distance of three kilometres twice during the nine-day festival of the Trinity at Puri.The application filed by ‘Jagannath Sanskruti Jana Jagarana Manch’ has sought modification of the June 18 order, saying the festival is deeply associated with the religious beliefs of millions of devotees of Lord Jagannath and it is “not impossible and impracticable” for the state and district administration to conduct the yatra by maintaining social distancing and following the Centre’s guidelines.Besides this, a separate application seeking modification of the June 18 order has been filed by one Aftab Hossen, who has said that “as per the ritual of Lord Jagannath, the Rath Yatra is performed every year and if one year it is not performed, same cannot be performed for the next 12 years”.Hossen, while urging the apex court to modify its order and allow the Rath Yatra, has said in his application that restraining the Rath Yatra this year would practically mean restraining it for the next 12 years and this could create “great repercussion and chaos” in the Lord Jagannath culture and rituals.In its separate application, the ‘Jagannath Sanskruti Jana Jagarana Manch’ has said that as per the earlier direction of the Orissa High Court as well as decision of the state government, 372 people were engaged in the construction of three raths/chariots for more than one-and-half months and all were isolated, tested and found Covid-19 negative. The top court’s June 18 order had came on a PIL filed by an Odisha-based NGO seeking cancellation or postponement of this year’s yatra.Two pleas were filed in the apex court seeking cancellation or postponement of the historic yatra.Besides the PIL filed by NGO ‘Odisha Vikas Parishad’, seeking stay on holding of the annual festival, an appeal has been filed by one Surendra Panigrahi of ‘Bhartiya Bikash Parishad’ against the Orissa High Court order of June 9, which had asked the state government to decide on holding the yatra in line with the Covid-19 guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-moves-sc-seeks-nod-for-puri-rath-yatra-without-public-participation/story-qc7sEaUkPVhNWUiHAZc8xI.html

22-06-2020||India||‘Allow Rath Yatra without public participation’: Supreme Court hears plea||The Supreme Court is hearing a bunch of petitions seeking modification in its order in which it had stayed Lord Jagannath’s famous Rath Yatra in Odisha.The Centre told the top court that annual Rath Yatra can be held without public participation keeping in view the Covid-19 pandemic.At least a dozen applicants, including one by Janardhan Pattajoshi Mohapatra, who is the hereditary chief servitor of Lord Jagannatha of the Jagannatha Temple, had approached the apex court seeking modification of its June 18 order.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sambit Patra has also filed a similar plea before the Supreme Court. He prayed that the Rath Yatra should be allowed to be held without public participation. Patra submitted that the Rath Yatra can be conducted by employing the services of Lord Jagannath’s 800 sevayats, who are persons who perform the ritual services of Lord Jagannath and other deities at the Puri Jagannath temple.Patra was hospitalised after he showed coronavirus symptoms and later discharged.The court had last Thursday stayed the annual event and associated activities at the Jagannath Temple in Odisha’s Puri in the wake of coronavirus pandemic. The yatra is scheduled to commence from June 23.The court order came on a petition filed by an NGO which had pointed out the health risk involved if the Rath Yatra is allowed at a time when Covid-19 is spreading rapidly across the country.The NGO referred to the Tablighi Jamaat incident which was Muslim religious congregation held in mid-March at Nizamuddin area in Delhi resulting in a spurt in Covid-19 cases across the country after people from various parts of India and even foreign countries attended the event.The Rath Yatra festival lasts for 10 to 12 days and involves a procession of chariots containing the deities Lord Jagannatha, his brother Lord Balabhadra and sister Devi Subhadra. The crowd pulling the chariots is very close to each other, which violates the social distancing norms during the times of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allow-rath-yatra-without-public-participation-supreme-court-hears-plea/story-AtSqUdmlUpukwhOU4h7qkI.html
22-06-2020||India||PM must be mindful of implications of his words: Manmohan Singh on Ladakh face-off||In his first remarks on the Ladakh face-off, former prime minister Manmohan Singh on Monday said PM Narendra Modi must be mindful of the implications of his words and cannot allow China to use them as a vindication of its position.Noting that disinformation is no substitute for diplomacy or decisive leadership, Singh called upon the prime minister to ensure justice for soldiers who died defending India’s territorial integrity.“To do any less would be a historic betrayal of people’s faith,” he said in a statement. The Congress has been attacking the government on Prime Minister Modi’s remarks at an all-party meeting that no one has entered Indian territory or captured any military post while referring to the eastern Ladakh standoff. The government has, however, said that attempts are being made to give a “mischievous interpretation” to the prime minister’s remarks. Singh said this is a moment where we must stand together as a nation and be united in our response to this brazen threat. Twenty Indian soldiers, including a colonel, were killed in the violent face-off with Chinese troops on the night of June 15/16 in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley.Noting that the country is standing at the historic cross-roads, Singh said the government’s decisions and actions will have serious bearings on how the future generations perceive us.“Those who lead us bear the weight of a solemn duty. And in our democracy that responsibility rests with the office of the prime minister,” he said.“The prime minister must always be mindful of the implications of his words and declarations on our nation’s security as also strategic and territorial interests,” he said.The Congress veteran said China is “brazenly and illegally” seeking to claim parts of Indian territory such as the Galwan Valley and the Pangong Tso Lake by committing multiple incursions from April 2020 till date. “We cannot and will not be cowed down by threats and intimidation nor permit a compromise with our territorial integrity. “The Prime Minister cannot allow them to use his words as a vindication of their position and must ensure that all organs of the Government work together to tackle this crisis and prevent it from escalating further,” he said.  “We remind the Government that disinformation is no substitute for diplomacy or decisive leadership. The truth cannot be suppressed by having pliant allies spout comforting but false statements,” he said. Singh also said that the sacrifice of soldiers cannot be allowed to go in vain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-must-be-mindful-of-implications-of-his-words-manmohan-singh-on-ladakh-face-off/story-oDVFHW7IFqzBwdbFbNi4CM.html

An earthquake of magnitude 5.5 on the Richter scale occurred 27km south-southwest of Champhai in Mizoram at 4:10am, according to the National Center for Seismology.The depth of the earthquake was 20 kilometres and the coordinates of the epicentre are 23.22 (latitude) and 93.24 (longitude), it said.“Spoke to the Chief Minister of Mizoram, Zoramthanga Ji on the situation in the wake of the earthquake there.

22-06-2020||India||India deploys specialised mountain forces to check China’s LAC transgressions||India has deployed its specialised high altitude warfare forces along the 3,488 km Line of Actual Control (LAC) to repel any transgression by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in either western, middle or eastern sectors.Top government sources confirmed that Indian Army has been directed to safeguard the LAC from any cross-border aggression by the PLA, which is showing hostile intent by amassing troops in a bid to cow down the Narendra Modi government.It is understood that specialised forces trained over the past decades for fighting on the northern front have been pushed up to the frontier to impose military costs if the red flag goes up. Unlike the PLA which moves in infantry combat vehicles and paved metalled roads to move, the Indian mountain troops are trained in guerrilla warfare and fighting in high altitude as shown by them in Kargil War. Also Watch | Can India fight war on two fronts with China & Pakistan? Gen VP Malik answers“The art of mountain fighting is the toughest as the cost of human casualties is 10 to each troop of the adversary sitting on a height. The troops from Uttarakhand, Ladakh, Gorkha, Arunachal and Sikkim have adapted to the rarefied heights over centuries and hence their capability of fighting is close quarter combats is without match. The artillery and the missiles have to have pin-pointed accuracy or else they miss the mountain target by miles,” said a former Indian Army chief.The other thing that works for the army is that the Tibetan plateau is flat on the Chinese side while the Indian side starts from K2 peak in Karakoram, to Nanda Devi in Uttarakhand, to Kanchenjung in Sikkim and Namche Barwa across Arunachal Pradesh border. “In mountains, it is not only difficult to capture territory but more difficult to hold it,” a China expert with South Block said. While India has noted with appreciation the voices coming out in its support from the Trump administration, including the President himself, the mood in Delhi is more like “atmanirbhar (self-reliant) Bharat” with no intent of asking anyone for military or diplomatic support. “I have my battalions lined up with armoured personnel carriers and artillery. India will not instigate or precipitate any skirmish but will reply to any transgression. The days of LAC nibbling are over. This is a battle of nerves and India is prepared to wait, come snow come sunshine,” said a senior minister.The Modi government is very unhappy that the Chinese President Xi Jinping broke all the “peace and tranquility” promises by not reining his favourite PLA western theatre commander Gen Zhao Zongqi, who is insistent on imposing 1960 eastern Ladakh map based on exaggerated territorial claims on India. This map where China claims territory upto Kongka La was unveiled by then Chinese premier Chou En Lai.Incidentally, Chou En Lai, the premier during 1962 conflict, had close links with President Xi Jinping’s family and Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s wife is the daughter of secretary of the former premier. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar father K Subrahmanyam was involved in India’s war effort as an officer in the Defence Ministry.It was only to set aside these historical baggage that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had initiated the Wuhan and Chennai understandings so that the two leaders could promote the bilateral relations post-Doklam. It is quite evident that President Xi had no such plans and has used tensions in East Ladakh to divert global attention from failure of China to alert the world about coronavirus. In the same way, another paramount leader used the 1962 conflict to deflect attention from the famine, due to failure of Great Leap Forward movement, in which millions of Chinese died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-deploys-specialised-mountain-forces-to-check-china-s-transgressions-along-lac/story-ABqjJToNSziO1QGfsCtPOI.html

22-06-2020||India||Unlock 1: Metro trains, schools and other services remain shut, no decision yet on resumption||The government has taken steps to restart the crucial functions which will help the economy. Among the steps announced as part of Unlock 1, the government allowed reopening of shopping malls, religious places and other establishments, but with conditions.However, there are many sectors and services which are still under lockdown. The plan is to reopen them in the second phase beginning July.Here is a look at such services:Metro trains: The metro services have been shut in Delhi since March 22, on the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced Janta Curfew to give people a glimpse of what was lay ahead. A full-scale lockdown was announced from May 25. While other transport services were allowed as part of the relaxations announced by the government in phases, metro services still remain shut. The last message posted on Delhi Metro’s Twitter handle on May 30 said that services will remain closed for commuters until further notice.The Ministry of Home Affairs had in its guidelines for ‘Unlock 1’ said that suburban train and metro railway services will remain closed till June 30. Accordingly, all the metro cities have kept these services under suspension. Limited suburban services have been started in Mumbai. These trains are being run for people involved in essential services.Schools and colleges: The strict lockdown has kept schools and colleges closed too. Many of them moved to the virtual world for teaching and learning activities. A decision on reopening the schools is expected in July; however, the Union HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal had recently said that he doesn’t see these institutions opening before August. The exams, scheduled to be held in March, were also postponed and will now be held after June 30, many school administration, state and central boards have said.Train services: Though the train services started last month, a full-scale resumption is still awaited. The Indian Railways resumed the train services gradually from May 12, after 51 days of suspension since March 22. It initially started with 15 pairs of trains. The initial services connects New Delhi to Dibrugarh, Agartala, Howrah, Patna, Bilaspur, Ranchi, Bhubaneswar, Secunderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram, Madgaon, Mumbai Central, Ahmedabad and Jammu Tawi railway stations.The railways then increased the number of trains to 100, which translated into 200 return journeys from June 1. The railways has said that it will keep resuming services based on the availability of coaches keeping in mind the 20,000 coaches that have been set aside for Covid-19 care centres.The nationwide lockdown was first announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 for 21 days in a bid to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.It was first extended till May 3 and then again till May 17. The lockdown was further extended till May 31.It is now restricted only in containment zones across the country and will continue till June 30. A large number of social, economic, religious and sports activities are currently allowed to function.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unlock-1-metro-trains-schools-and-other-services-still-shut-no-decision-yet-on-resumption/story-MuBGeUcHyn4r8R9fdxms0L.html

22-06-2020||India||57 in state-run women’s rescue home in UP’s Kanpur Covid-19 +ve, 5 of them pregnant||Five girl inmates among the 57 who tested positive for coronavirus in the state-run women’s rescue home were found pregnant, leaving the Kanpur administration on tenterhooks.CPI (M) polit buro member Subhashini Ali met SSP Kanpur Dinesh Kumar P on Sunday and submitted a formal complaint raising questions about the issue. She said pregnancy of girls in the home as well as infection among them needed to be investigated. She said it had emerged that one of the inmates was HIV positive and another had Hepatitis C. Hygiene and sanitisation were major issues in the rescue home, she said.The SSP said he had asked SP Kanpur South Aparna Gupta to look into the complaint.But district probation officer Ajit Kumar who feigned ignorance about the pregnancy of girls till Saturday, said the girls who were pregnant were brought in Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act-related cases.He, however, denied having any knowledge of two of them being HIV and Hepatitis C positive. The DPO is in charge of the women’s rescue home and reports to the district magistrate.Member of state women’s commission Poonam Kapoor dispelled the notion that the girls got pregnant while staying in the home. There were others who were lodged in POCSO cases and were pregnant, she said.Kapoor said it appeared that two girl inmates caught the infection when they were sent to LLR hospital for check-up . Since they all lived together, the infection spread among others.Two days ago, a girl complaining of flu like symptoms and breathing problems tested positive for Covid 19. After that, samples of 33 girls were tested and they were also found positive. Later, 16 and then seven more girls tested positive. Since then, the women’s rescue home in posh Swaroop Nagar has been sanitised and the girls have been quarantined.Late on Sunday night, commissioner, Kanpur division, Sudhir M Bobde and district magistrate Dr Brahmdev Ram Tiwari said there were total seven girls pregnant in the rescue home and five of them were Covid-19 positive. They were pregnant at the time they were brought to the rescue home, they said. Two of pregnant girls have been admitted to LLR hospital and three to Rama Medical College for Covid treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/57-in-state-run-women-s-rescue-home-in-up-s-kanpur-covid-19-positive-5-of-them-pregnant/story-2jX3N8ROjygl8uFiXnri9J.html
22-06-2020||India||100 days of Covid-19: Cooking up a storm in the lockdown||In the early days of the first lockdown, DK Ghosh was a man looking for chicken as if he were an Argonaut in search of the Golden Fleece. Ghosh, a retired professional in Delhi, had been told by his butcher that he could get no meat. So, he walked 3 km towards a cold-meat store he occasionally ordered from but which had stopped home delivery, and returned with a 2kg-bird chopped into curry cuts. On the way back home, he called his friends, and sent them in the same direction. He also stocked up on rice and potatoes, cheese and cream and tinned products for days when his wife would cook fancy; he confirmed at the colony gate that his regular vegetable and fruit vendors would be allowed entry, and then climbed up the stairs to barricade himself. His wife, he found, was re-opening her dormant Instagram handle, with the photo of a sorry looking cauliflower roast. She would get better at it.Roast red pepper hummus streaked with olive oil. Lemon chicken. Chicken with 40 cloves of garlic. Gourd with prawns. Mango flan. Honey-coated ribs. Pulao and paella were uploaded in the days that followed. Her cousins were already on Instagram, and constantly ‘on’.During the lockdown, Instagram became an online derby. Men and women were pickling, plating, baking, flipping, slicing eatables with the same flourish with which, at fairs, farmers present prize animals. Nikita Varma, who runs the popular iamdatingfood Instagram handle and vlogs on YouTube, said, “People are joining Instagram to put up pictures of food in hundreds every hour. I put up a video on making rosogolla but was unsure about the response. Soon enough, I got people posting me back pictures of their versions.” Social media is where people are talking proteins, carbs, community, family, family traditions, all day long.With more than a billion shuttered indoors or separated from their families, social media and family WhatsApp groups were flooded with people learning how to cook, and not just casually. The accidental chef was here to stay. Dr Manish Bansal of Mumbai found his calling in bread, a food item that has been accessible to middle and upper middle-class Indians all through the lockdown in its many varieties. Bread was had at breakfast, lunch or dinner. Getting dry yeast, a key ingredient, was, however, at times, a problem, says another bread enthusiast, Manuja Shroff, an entrepreneur who is a restaurant expert on Tripadvisor. Dr Bansal eats bread, he makes bread. “Baking bread involves organising everything from your ingredients to forward-thinking your way through the stages of the recipe. It also takes patience. You have to wait for the dough to rise,” he said. “This virus is a conspiracy to make men learn to cook. The lockdown has been an awakening of sorts for me.”Rice and grain, however, pushed India’s poor, in the same period, into despair. Rajesh Shah, a vegetable vendor, who services a south Delhi locality, had to buy a 25-kg bag of flour for R1,000 at the Tughlaqabad wholesale market, i.e., R200 more than the pre lockdown price. Seema Devi, who works as a help in four houses in Delhi, almost got on the bus for Patna on being paid token money during the lockdown as she did not have enough to feed her family. During the lockdown, she was not able to afford chicken or fish. So, easy access to, and excess of, protein on one end of the spectrum versus none on the other end, was a snapshot of how India ate over the past three months.A meal-time short-cut was the appearance of one-pot dishes and the imaginative recycling of leftovers as most Indians were working out of home, but also having to do the housework in the absence of domestic help. Sona Mazumdar, chief partnership officer at an entertainment company, said she was “very charged up” for at least the first 60 days. “But when that enthusiasm petered out, I opted for easy fixes like a Chinese chicken gravy made earlier put on top of rice, or pita bread bought from the market which I then stuffed with chickpeas and a grilled beetroot salad.” Shroff said there were days when the market didn’t have what she wanted, or what they have is not of the best quality so she has made do with what is available.“It is OK if I don’t have shaven parmesan on my Ceasar Salad or my pizza doesn’t have basil leaves. The family eats it.”One of the many lockdown habits householders said they picked up was stocking up by default. If they go to the market to buy three things, they now look around and buy three more. “We are eating more than usual, because our daily schedules have gone haywire. Food is a way to keep down anxiety,” says Ravi Kumar, a sociologist in Delhi. The Kumars, a family of four, do a mix of comfort and experimental cooking. This, he says, is ‘crisis food’. The entire production of putting it together is a fragile experiment, a seeking out of the familiar “when life, as you know it, is in crisis or the changes that are happening around you, are either too fast or too slow”.In the first phase of the lockdown, food supply was hit in almost all neigbourhoods. E-commerce did not kick in. “Amazon, Modern Bazaar kept the cart page alive but after one filled the cart and went to the payment page, they said they were unable to deliver. The local grocers functioned best,” said Kumar. Writer Sheeba Aslam Fehmi said, “The delivery boys were apprehensive about catering to Old Delhi areas due to the often false red-flagging by the TV media. We also started to hesitate to order fearing exposure to the virus. Therefore, our order frequency came down quite a bit.”There are mixed reports. Samantha Dutta, head, sales and marketing with a leading frozen food company, relied on Spencer’s online grocery shopping app, Mother Dairy outlets and the roaming vegetable carts. Cultural historian Sohail Hashmi, a resident of Kishengarh village, Delhi, said the lockdown turned many of the unorganised labourers jobless so they turned vegetable vendors. The Result: neighbourhoods such as his, which border tony localities like Vasant Kunj, were never short of supplies. This was unlike the situation faced by his own domestic helps, many of them still without basics such as ration cards.Sona Mazumdar of Gurugram, said the lockdown made her look for multiple options and not stick to the big ecommerce websites and apps. “I started using a new app, Otipy. It delivered fruits and veggies straight from the farms. I used Jalongi for fish. For my groceries and non-veg items, Swiggy was my saviour throughout. In mid-May, Amazon Pantry and Big Basket opened up and I began to order again from them.”Restaurant owners were an endangered species now. Fehmi, who runs Delhi’s Walled City restaurant, was caught unawares when the lockdown started. “We had a full inventory running and we had to shut it down. The dry groceries were given away to the staff and locals.” The restaurant scenario will become less bleak but not “for the next six months at least for the dining-in arrangement,” she said. “We have to ensure the health of our guests, which is not possible till the pandemic is not declared over. As far as the take-away services are concerned, the major clientele was that of students and young mid-segment professionals, who are leaving the metros due to the general closure of institutions and businesses. The staff, too, has left for their home towns”.Sameer Seth, co-owner of Mumbai’s Bombay Canteen, is not ready to give up. If the mountain will not come to Muhammad, then Muhammad must go to the mountain seems to be the policy. “Our restaurants may be closed but our kitchens are open,” he says. The Canteen has branched out into “any time of the day” home-delivery-to-the-doorstep services with half-plate options as well. DIY meals may be the future of the dining industry with restaurants looking for different ways to stay engaged with customers. The Canteen, for example, is getting chefs to hold paid classes via Zoom and sending the ingredients to guests who sign-up; on Instagram they hold ‘knowledge sessions’ that are free. But the situation is still not free of danger. Aekta Kapoor, a magazine editor in Delhi, said from now on, she would “order infrequently and prefer to give businesses to home chefs instead of restaurants. After March 24, June 4 was the only time I ordered in.” Ranjini Chatterjee, a graphic designer who runs a handicrafts business in Kolkata, summed up the collective holding in of breath when anyone, anywhere, orders in these days. “Now if I get a pizza or a burger pang, I sheepishly order and hope for the best.” Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100-days-of-covid-19-cooking-up-a-storm-in-the-lockdown/story-Hx1Nh7EV47tQosuoWZWGWP.html
22-06-2020||India||Pollution control boards must intensify actions||State Pollution Control Boards are severely underperforming. The case of the Assam Pollution Control Board’s action in the ongoing Indian Oil fire case, which has devastated the global biodiversity hot spot, Dibru Sikhowa, is a case in point.Why not learn from the Swachh Bharat Sarvekshan (SBS) — a competitive survey and ranking of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) — to foster institutional action? The SBS relies on the ULBs to fill in the information, and sends out teams for verification. The public is also asked to participate. Of course, this has loopholes, many ULBs claim more than they do, but it forces them to act more swiftly in many areas ranking high on the survey. Given the high toll of pollution, institutional change is urgent.The Pollution Control Boards should be similarly ranked, with modifications. Public participation should be given more weightage. The space given to public opinion will also serve as an incentive for the PCBs to improve public engagement and respond to complaints. Second, pollution control boards are understaffed. It isn’t all lack of funds — it’s just poor management. Scientific posts remain unfilled — recruitment is slow, and technical capacity remains low. Being scored on this could change this. Pollution costs lives and lost lives cost the country. One can offer several remedies, but incentives for institutional strengthening are key. The SBS is an evolving process, yet it is instructive. A Pradooshan Sarvekshan could be the low-cost incentive we need to kick-start pollution abatement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pollution-control-boards-must-intensify-actions/story-D9UnyYQhdfWIOo55fQl3CO.html
22-06-2020||India||India’s infra push behind Chinese aggression||To set the matter straight, the Prime Minister’s Office on Saturday, in a statement, said that the Prime Minister was crystal clear that “India would respond firmly to any attempts to transgress the Line of Actual Control (LAC)”. He specifically emphasised that in contrast to the past neglect of such challenges, Indian forces now decisively counter any violations of LAC, the statement further said. As PM Modi said, because we have better infrastructure in place at LAC, we are to patrol more, and hence we tend to meet more and confront more. To put things in the right perspective, the increased strategic infrastructure has rattled China to no end as the Dragon is facing resounding Indian military might, not the relatively docile India it used to deal with, before 2014.In the last few years, there have been frequent face-offs in certain sensitive areas in Eastern Ladakh. It has been a direct outcome of India’s ability of increased patrolling in the area due to vastly improved infrastructure readiness. In fact, the more frequent face-offs are not necessarily a sign of weakness, or due to deteriorating relations, but indicate greater ability on the part of Indian Army to monitor, detect and respond to Chinese PLA patrolling. As infrastructure keeps improving, these possibilities will only increase.There is a long history of India’s dealings with China, and almost all of the reverses that India has suffered have been during the previous rule, particularly of Congress regimes. It all started with the Tibet’s annexation by China which India accepted quietly in 1959. In 1962, the loss of large chunk of territory, and the then Indian Prime Minister interpreting it by saying that “not a blade of grass grows there”, sums up the attitude towards border issues. During the 1980s and 1990s, when China started taking lead over India economically, militarily, and in infrastructure construction, India was not able to respond and match up in equal measure. In the 1990s, boundary management agreements were signed that further limited India’s manoeuvring ability, particularly the 1993 Accord. The United Progressive Alliance era (2004 to 2014) allowed multiple transgression of Indian land through deceptive salami-slicing methods of the Chinese, and even lost lands in Demjok areas of Ladakh during the period of 2008 to 2012. AK Antony, the then defence minister, conceded in Parliament that we have lost the infrastructure race with China. It was in this era, that the serving army chiefs repeatedly pointed out how our armed forces were facing shortfall of critical ammunition and border infrastructure woes to counter enemies.  The policy paralysis was reversed following the regime change in 2014 and Prime Minister Narendra Modi changed decades of drift in India’s policy towards China by bridging the infrastructure gaps in border areas by constructing roads and bridges with faster pace. It was PM Modi who dared China on several fronts and foiled its bids in Doklam, stopped RCEP, and strongly opposed Chinese dream project OBOR.The genesis of the building up of faster strategic infrastructure can be traced back to 2014, when the Modi government gave it a big push. One of the first decision of the government was to issue a general approval in July 2014 for the creation of road network by Border Roads Organisation (BRO) within 100km of aerial distance from LAC. This general approval ensured that requirement of prior central government and other bureaucratic process were done away with.Subsequently, this exception has been extended to all border security related infrastructure such as border outposts, floodlights, fencing etc, and all projects executed by the Central paramilitary organisations of the ministry of Home Affairs.This was in stark contrast to the approach taken by the UPA government where blocking of such sensitive infrastructure projects under various reasons was the norm. Often the delays were due to flip flops on environmental clearances.Similarly, the Modi government delegated powers to DG, BRO, clearing the way for construction of 66 operationally critical Indo-China borders roads. Earlier, every approval came to the ministry of defence. These powers were subsequently delegated to officers up to chief engineer level in BRO. The government also took crucial steps like the procurement of modern construction on a massive scale during 2017-2020. It also enhanced airlift of construction equipment and material from 2017 onwards, often using Chinhook helicopters.The proactive shift in the policymaking resulted in massive infrastructure creation. According to BRO statistics, between 2008 and 2017, the formation cutting of about 230km of roads were done annually, but this has now been increased to 470km per year between 2017 and 2020 along the India-China border. Similarly, between 2008 and 2017, the speed of surfacing of roads was 170km per year, but it has been increased to 380km per year between 2017 and 2020.Only one tunnel was constructed between 2008 and 2014, while six tunnels have been made during 2014 to 2020. The construction of about 19 tunnels is also under progress.During 2008 to 2014, 7270 metres long bridges were built, while 14,450 metres of bridges were built between 2014 and 2020. In the period between 2008 and 2014, roads of 3,610km were constructed on the border while 4,764kms of roads were built between 2014 and 2020.For about five decades after 1962 war, the construction of these roads which were neglected has now been taken care of and it has been constructed in record period of time along the LAC. Undoubtedly, India’s push to build and upgrade infrastructure along the LAC is behind China’s aggression and recent border skirmishes.(The writer is the former secretary of the Research and Analysis Wing.

22-06-2020||India||Situation along LAC tense with full army deployment||The situation continues to remain tense along the 3,488km-long Line of Actual Control, with both the Indian and Chinese armies fully deployed, air bases activated, and the navy on standby, following the June 15 face-off in the Galwan sector.Though the situation has not escalated since the Galwan incident, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is continuing troop accretion with support elements on standby, Indian officials familiar with the matter said. The Indian Army positions are also being beefed up in response to the PLA build-up in the Xinjiang and Tibet regions, and the air forces of the two sides are keeping surveillance watch on each other, the officials added.One of them said on condition of anonymity that Indian military commanders have issued instructions to use force if PLA troops cross the Galwan nullah to attack the Indian Patrol Post 14. The PLA has amassed troops across the nullah, and both sides are holding ground, he said.The situation on ground is no different from June 16, with the two armies not thinking in terms of disengagement at the moment along the lines of the June 6 framework laid down in a Lt General-level meeting. Senior Indian military commanders are watching the PLA movement in the Aksai Chin region, while the ministry of external affairs is trying to search for a diplomatic solution. “The situation has cooled to a little extent, but de-escalation appears to be a long haul due to the position China has taken on the Galwan Valley,” said a senior Indian diplomat.Military watchers said they were shocked by the level of aggression on social media -- on both sides of the border -- with several people asking their respective armies for retribution. “All those asking for revenge are war mongers who do not have any idea of destruction a war between two nuclear nations can cause. If the Indian or Chinese soldiers had not obeyed the 1996/2005 military protocol for the LAC on June 15, there would have been carnage leading to a vertical escalation all across the border with immediate violence on nearby patrolling point 15 and 17,” said a former Indian Army chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/situation-along-lac-tense-with-full-army-deployment/story-RsyciMbh4D7rH5r3iigtyI.html
22-06-2020||India||Will ‘Boycott China’ strategy really help?||Sino-Indian relations will not return to normal for a long time. Diplomatic and military efforts to restore status quo ante at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) will continue. But there is a widespread consensus that Sino-Indian rivalry will ultimately be decided in the realm of economics.China’s economic rise is associated with its export-led growth. This is why every time we have a conflict with China; there are calls for a boycott of Chinese goods. Those championing such ideas believe that our boycott will hurt China economically. Such views are, at best, half-baked. Economic competition between countries, especially ones as big as India and China, is far more nuanced. It requires long-term strategic vision. Foreign trade, at best, can only be one aspect of it. Also, military and diplomatic allies might not be willing to help when it comes to the economy.Any serious discussion on Sino-Indian economic competition requires looking at the US-China gap and China-India gap. The former is what is driving China’s larger ambitions. The latter matters because it tells us about our ability to catch up.China might overtake the US in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), but it will not achieve US living standards. China’s economic growth since the 1980s is unparalleled. Between 1960 and 1980, its share of global GDP increased from 1.1% to 1.2%. By 2018, China’s share of global GDP had increased to 13%. China’s GDP was just 5% of US GDP in 1980. This increased to more than 60% by 2018. India’s gains have been more modest on this front. The growing convergence in Chinese and American GDP has not translated itself proportionately in terms of living standards. Because China’s population is significantly more than that of the US, Chinese per capita incomes are much lower. Even though China is ranked second in terms of size of GDP, it is not even a high-income country today. The World Bank classifies China as an Upper Middle Income country. High Income countries have a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of $12,376 or more. Upper-Middle Income countries have a GNI per capita between $3,996 and $12,375. India is among Lower Middle Income countries, which have GNI per capita of between $1,026 and $3,995. Of the 218 countries for which this classification is available, 80 are in the High Income Group. (See Chart 1 and 2)Demographic shift will force China to recalibrate its economic strategy. Unlike what is commonly believed in India, high population need not be an unmitigated curse for economic growth. A large population can actually create tail-winds for economic activity. This is because it also brings more working hands. Two factors determine whether this happens or not. One is the age composition of the population. This determines what share of it can actually work. The other is whether or not there are enough resources to work with.China’s high-growth phase coincides with a favourable age composition of its population. World Bank data shows that the share of population aged between 15 and 64 years started rising sharply in China after the 1980s. This ratio was significantly higher than the US or India. It stagnated at very high levels in the last decade and has finally started declining now.This ratio followed similar trajectory for China and India until the 1970s. It was only after China announced the One Child Policy in 1980 that the share of population below 15 years started falling and that of the 15-64 age group started rising. The strategy brought gains to China in the past. It had more workers and fewer dependents in its population. But it will extract a cost now. Thanks to the One Child Policy, the Chinese economy has been adding fewer young workers to its economy. This means that there will be more dependents and fewer workers going forward. Because India did not control its birth rates, it has a larger share of young workers and will continue to see a rise in the share of working population ratio. Developed countries like the US have a stable ratio because they are characterized by low birth and low death rates. (See Chart 3)A falling share of working population means that China will have to keep increasing its value added per worker in order to maintain growth and improve living standards. This will require a move towards more skill-oriented jobs. For example, assembling car parts will entail a lower value added per worker than making a car engine. Where does China stand vis-a-vis the US and India on this count? World Bank gives data on sector-wise value added per worker. Even until 2000, value added per worker in China and India, when compared to the US, was almost similar. China has made rapid advances in manufacturing since then and surged ahead of India. (See Chart 4)The sharp rise in China’s value added per worker in manufacturing is the biggest evidence of its growing technological prowess. Not all of this has come from scrupulous means. Intellectual Property Right and technology theft-related disputes have emerged as one of the biggest sources of conflict between China and the US today. If China manages to catch up with the innovation curve of the US and other high income countries, it can make rapid economic and strategic advances.What explains China’s ability to ambush developed countries such as the US on the technology frontier? It has built a robust research and development ecosystem within its country. This can be seen in the sharp rise of patent applications filed in China, which are not only way more than India, but also the US. As can be seen, India is in no position to influence this competition at the moment. Any significant advance on this count will require a big boost to education spending in India. (See Chart 5)Will ‘Boycott China’ help?Any strategy to even partly severe trade ties with China must carefully evaluate the pros and cons. Such a move will hurt China by taking away a small share of its export earnings. But it will also require finding alternative sources of such imports, either domestically or internationally. An HT analysis by Vineet Sachdev using World Bank data shows that more than 50% of India’s imports from China are either capital or intermediate goods. Consumer goods, which are more likely to bear a Made in China label, have a share of less than 20%. While public opinion might be driven by the idea of boycotting consumer goods, any knee-jerk reaction can end up disrupting capital goods and intermediate goods supplies and therefore domestic value chains. To be sure, this does not mean that India should not strive for reducing its import dependence on China. However, any such policy should work via a simultaneous development of domestic capabilities which can satisfy the import demand. This will require access to funds, technology as well as export markets.Can India hope to get the support of the anti-China bloc in such endeavours? Let us take the example of the US. The Indo-US strategic alliance is stronger than ever today. Concerns about China’s growing power have been an important driver of this alliance. This strategic concurrence, however, has not led to a convergence on economic matters. The biggest proof of this is the continuing impasse over an Indo-US trade agreement.India’s counter-strategising against China will only succeed if we make sure that our bilateral and multilateral reactions to the recent developments maximise our gains while minimising any concessions we make for strategic support. India is a democracy unlike China. Domestic political pressures of achieving quick and radical gains will only complicate the pursuit of this objective||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-boycott-china-strategy-really-help/story-paDe7aiEqGIZUcYkkNsgbM.html

22-06-2020||India||Rajnath Singh meets chiefs, says keep strict vigil along LAC||As tensions simmer along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, where aggressive military posturing by Indian and Chinese forces has garnered global attention, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday made a detailed assessment of the ground situation at the disputed border, where 20 Indian and scores of Chinese soldiers were killed in a skirmish in Galwan valley, two senior officers familiar with the developments said on Sunday.Singh held an hour-long meeting with chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat and the three service chiefs at his residence. He was briefed about the preparations of the military and its readiness to respond to any provocative actions by the Chinese forces, one of the officers said on condition of anonymity.The meeting came before Singh heads to Russia to participate in the Victory Day parade in Moscow on June 24. He will meet his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu during the visit (June 21-25), and the spike in border tensions with China is set to figure in the discussions, said the second officer cited above, asking not to be identified.Moscow’s relations with New Delhi and Beijing are currently very good, and Russian diplomats, in recent remarks to the Indian media, have spoken about the need to ease tensions between India and China for regional stability.The minister told the military brass that India will not escalate the border dispute but it will respond to threatening actions with firmness and reiterated that local commanders at the LAC have full authority to do what is necessary to safeguard Indian interests, as outlined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an all-party meeting last week, the second officer said.A significant change in the rules of engagement (ROE) by the Indian Army following the June 15 Galwan valley skirmish has given complete freedom of action to commanders deployed along the LAC to handle situations at the tactical level.The commanders will no longer be bound by restrictions on the use of firearms and will have full authority to respond to extraordinary situations using all resources at their disposal, as reported by Hindustan Times on Saturday.The government has given financial powers worth ~500 crore per project to the armed forces to fast-track the purchase of critical weapons and ammunition to deal with any kind of scenario, the second officer said. Similar financial powers for emergency purchases were bestowed on the military after the 2016 Uri terror attack and the 2019 Balakot air strikes.While no violent face-offs have been reported after the deadly Galwan valley clash that has hurt bilateral ties, India and China have significantly beefed up their deployments in the extended region on both sides of the unmarked and volatile border, said the first officer sited above.The two armies have marshalled thousands of soldiers on their respective sides of the LAC and the military buildup consists of fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns and missile systems.The army has strengthened its posture across the length of the LAC – from Ladakh to Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh – where reinforcements have been sent and the IAF has also has kept its contingency plans ready to respond to any provocative actions.Apart from Sukhoi-30s and upgraded MiG-29 fighter jets, the IAF is operating Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters – both imported from the United States – in the Ladakh sector that has been the focus of current border tensions.Satellite imagery has revealed a Chinese buildup in the Galwan valley and fresh inputs also suggest heightened Chinese activity in the Finger Area (a cluster of strategic features) near Pangong Tso, where new Chinese positions, bunkers and observation posts have come up between Finger 4 and Finger 8 in the last seven weeks, restricting the scope of Indian patrols to reach areas that New Delhi considers its territory.The Chinese PLA is fully deployed in Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) with air, artillery and missile support, and the PLA Air Force has activated its bases in both Xinjiang and TAR, with fighter aircraft making a show of strength in Aksai Chin area, as reported by Hindustan Times on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-meets-chiefs-says-keep-strict-vigil-along-lac/story-AAFa7TwRDQGdbHqlkUrnIL.html
22-06-2020||India||Chhattisgarh, Centre in tussle over 2013 Maoist ambush probe||The Congress-led Chhattisgarh government is locked in a conflict with the Centre over a fresh case registered by the state police over a 2013 ambush by suspected Maoist rebels in which 27 people, including senior Congress leaders, were killed, people familiar with the matter said requesting anonymity. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) wrote a letter to the Chhattisgarh police last week asking it not to proceed with the investigation in a first information report (FIR) registered by Bastar police on May 26 because the central agency was already investigating it, the people quoted above added. The ministry of home affairs (MHA) too has opined that since both the FIRs (registered on May 25, 2013 and May 26, 2020) relate to the same incident , NIA, which investigates acts of terrorism, has the powers to take over the probe related to the fresh FIR too, the documents, accessed by HT, have revealed.On May 25, 2013, around 150 suspected members of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) attacked a cavalcade of Congress leaders in an ambush at Jheerum Ghati in Chhattisgarh’s Sukhma district, killing 27 people, including senior leaders Nand Kumar Patel, Mahendra Karma, Dinesh Patel and Vidya Charan Shukla. NIA on June 16 approached a special court in Jadgalpur saying that the Chhattisgarh police would be violating the section 6 of the NIA Act, which specifically prohibits the state government from proceeding with any investigation once a case is entrusted to the agency.In a letter to the Bastar superintendent of police on June 10, Amit Singh, NIA’s chief investigating officer of the Jheerum Ghati attack, asked that all May 26, 2020 FIR-related documents be transferred to the agency. He asked the police not to proceed with the investigation as “it may lead to vexatious and avoidable litigation due to conflict of jurisdiction”. HT has reviewed a copy of the letter to the state police.Singh said a charge sheet had already been filed against nine suspects in September 2015 in the case and searches were being carried out for arresting 25 more and the trial too was at an advanced stage. HT has reviewed copies of NIA’s letter to the Bastar SP, its petition in the court and MHA’s opinion.Bastar’s inspector general of police Sundarraj P told HT :“We are taking a legal opinion on NIA’s plea after which a decision will be taken”.NIA informed the special court last week that “the contents of FIR (registered by Bastar police on May 26, 2020) fall in the definition of terrorist act as well as in the ambit of scheduled offence prescribed in the NIA Act, 2008”, while urging the court to give directions to state police not to pursue it. The Chhattisgarh government is in no mood to hand over the probe to the central agency, said the state government officials familiar with the matter. The state government has, over past couple of years, repeatedly questioned NIA’s credibility, saying it didn’t probe a conspiracy angle. Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel himself has said on numerous occasions that the Centre is not allowing a thorough probe by the state government by refusing to transfer the NIA case to it.The Chhattisgarh Congress communications department ‘s Shailesh Nitin Trivedi said – “We have been saying from day one that it was a political criminal conspiracy, which NIA has failed to unearth. We will do everything to find out what exactly happened in that in 2013 incident in which our beloved Congress leaders were brutally murdered by Naxals. Why is the Centre not investigating the larger conspiracy angle?”.The Baghel government, in January, moved the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the NIA Act, saying it takes away the powers of states enshrined in the constitution to investigate crimes . The NIA is currently empowered to take over any case in states without their consent. Chhattisgarh is the first state ever to challenge the entire NIA Act.The NIA didn’t respond to phone calls or an SMS query.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chattisgarh-centre-in-tussle-over-2013-maoist-ambush-probe/story-rXnJ1lX8PPhTYj7WQjCI4K.html
22-06-2020||India||Radio channels in Nepal air weather reports on disputed areas: Residents||: Some Nepalese FM radio stations have started broadcasting weather bulletins for Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura, areas close to the border that Nepal claims its own in a move that has irked India, according to residents in the frontier areas in Uttarakhand.These radio programmes could be heard from Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh on the border. The FM stations are located in Darchula, the district in Nepal bordering India.Nepal has issued a new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani, and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepalese territory, a move that has drawn flak from India.Krishna Garbiyal, a prominent leader of the Rung community in Dharchula town in Pithoragarh, said the Nepalese FM stations have started giving weather reports of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura.Residents in bordering areas, especially in Dharchula, also said the radio channels, in between songs, were airing speeches by Nepali politicians and leaders claiming that the disputed areas belonged to Nepal.“...Nepalese songs are listened to by villagers on both sides of the border, these anti-India speeches, delivered by Nepalese leaders from time to time, affect people living on both sides of the border...,” said Shalu Dayal, a resident of Dantu village of Dharchula.Ashok Nabiyal, a social activist from Dharchula’s Vyans Valley, said Indian intelligence agencies active at Indo-Nepal border need to take cognisance of this “propaganda”. “Nepalese propaganda is clearly aimed at influencing locals on this side of the border and strengthening their claims...,” he said.Districts officials said they were not aware of any propaganda from Nepalese side. “We do not have any such information. Our intelligence units have given us any feedback on this issue,” said Preeti Priya Darshani, superintendent of police (SP) of Pithoragarh.Nrip Singh Napalchyal , former Uttarakhand chief secretary and a resident of Pithoragarh’s Rang community, said that “traditionally and historically” Kalapani had always been venerated as the source of the Kali River.It originates from Kalapani, at an altitude of 3,600 metres, and flows southwards. The area is named after Hindu goddess Kali, whose temple is situated in near the strategically important Lipulekh pass that is on India’s border with China.“Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura are part of the Indian border with China and they have no relation with the Nepal border. Lipulekh pass has served as the entrance of Indian traders and pilgrims going to Kailash Mansarovar, which has never been objected to by any ruler of Nepal till now,” said Napalchyal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/radio-channels-in-nepal-air-weather-reports-on-disputed-areas-residents/story-Y6qF5HNpXwHZ6uo6zR9UBM.html
22-06-2020||India||Assam oil spill: Amid fumes and tremors, 10k people in 12 relief camps wait to go back home||Babul Moran has shifted his “residence” three times in the last 26 days. He was forced to move from his home in Baghjan village of Assam’s Tinsukia district on May 27, the day a natural gas well of Oil India Limited (OIL) located around 700 metres away had a blowout. His family and few dozen others were shifted to a nearby school, turned into a relief camp, 1.5km away from the well. On June 9, the well caught fire, and claimed lives of two firefighters. The fire soon spread to nearby houses, fields and the Maguri Motapung wetland a few hundred metres away.With the threat of it spreading further, the 26-year old and his family, along with others, were shifted to another camp 15km away from the well. Two days later, on June 11, OIL personnel were able to contain the fire. Moran and his family again moved back to the relief camp in the school, where they have been staying since.“We have been provided with adequate facilities at the camp. But the sound from the well, which is like a huge storm, has been continuing since May 27. Since the fire started, we have been experiencing tremors as well and it is very unnerving,” said Moran.Moran’s plight is shared by hundreds of families in Baghjan and nearby villages. According to Assam government, nearly 10,000 people are now based in 12 relief camps, waiting for the blowout to be plugged. Around 15 houses have been gutted by the fire.“Our house was located barely 50 metres away from the well. The fire has destroyed the house, all our belongings, a small tea garden spread over 12 bighas (around 4 acres) and a vegetable garden located 500 metres away,” said Rupam Moran, a Baghjan resident who too has shifted residence thrice. Since May 27, gas and oil condensate released from the blowout has polluted the area. The carcass of a Gangetic dolphin with its skin peeled was found in the Maguri wetland. When the well ignited, it spread to the important bid nesting site, killing fishes, frogs, insects and forcing birds to leave nests with eggs.“When the blow out happened roofs of houses, tress and water bodies in the area got covered with an oil-like layer. When the well caught fire, it affected flora and fauna in Maguri as well,” said Binanda Hatibaruah, a prominent birding tour guide.On June 11, two days after the fire started, several local nature lovers and three experts from the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) went nearly 700 metres inside Maguri, and saw the damage to the area first-hand.“Besides the local bird species, Maguri is a nesting site for many migratory birds. This was the breeding season for many birds, because of the oil layer on the wetland and the grassland where the nests are getting burned, they have left. We saw burned insects, dead frogs and abandoned nests,” said Hatibaruah.An environment impact assessment of the area is being done by several agencies on the request of OIL. On Friday, Pollution Control Board Assam (PCBA) sent notice of OIL asking it to close operations at all its 21 gas and oil wells in Baghjan oil field citing violation of norms and threat to humans and environment. OIL is planning to contest the notice in Gauhati High Court.The Baghjan well was producing 100,000 standard cubic metre per day (SCMD) of gas at a depth of 3,870 metres. The blowout happened when workover operations were underway to produce gas from new sand (oil and gas bearing reservoir) at a depth of 3,729 metres.Workover is an intervention in an existing oil or natural gas well that requires invasive techniques like wireline, coil tubing or snubbing.On June 1, OIL issued a show cause notice to the company conducting the workover operations at the well under supervision of OIL when the blowout happened. An inquiry committee had also been set up. On Wednesday, OIL suspended two officials for their role in the blow out.According to a retired OIL official, who did not wish to be identified, the head of the well was being repaired while the workover operation was underway, which is the normal practice. The blowout preventer (BoP) -- a specialised valve or mechanical device used to seal, control and monitor oil and gas wells -- installed in the well was removed when the gas started leaking, resulting in the blowout, according to the retired official.While six foreign experts at the site have expressed confidence about controlling the fire and capping the well safely, the operation requires a large amount of water, installation of high discharge pumps, and removal of debris. All these could take nearly four week, OIL officials said.In September 2005, a similar fire broke out at an abandoned oil well of OIL at Dikom in Dibrugarh district. It needed expertise of foreign specialists and took over a month to bring under control. “There are few methods to control a blow out. First the area near the well is cleared of all debris. One of the oldest techniques is to carry out a blast at the well so that there is lack of oxygen and gas (or oil) in the area and the fire gets doused,” said a retired oil drilling expert who asked not to be named.“Another method is to drill another well or wells near the site and connect them to the blow out well allowing the gas or oil to get diverted. Another option is to put a new blowout preventer,” he added.Protests and blockades by local groups have affected gas and oil production of OIL. Since May 27, when the blow out occurred, the company has suffered cumulative production loss of 8013 MT crude oil and 10.24 MMSCM of natural gas, according to OIL officials. Meanwhile, efforts are underway to control the fire and plug the blowout. Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed the situation at Baghjan on June 18 and assured Centre’s full commitment to support and provide relief and rehabilitation to affected families. According to a release by the PM’s office, operations at the well are being executed as per schedule, and the blowout is proposed to be capped by July 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-oil-spill-amid-fumes-and-tremors-10k-people-in-12-relief-camps-wait-to-go-back-home/story-6PAlO0cCMjngcfIP0oFpjO.html
22-06-2020||India||Closure notice to Assam gas field over blowout||The Assam Pollution Control Board issued a closure notice on Friday to the Baghjan oilfield of Oil India Limited (OIL) on the grounds that the company has been operating it without prior permissions, including the key “consent to establish” and “consent to operate” clearances.Any industry likely to discharge effluents or emit pollutants is supposed to get these permissions from the state pollution control boards under the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.A blowout that began in the oilfield on May 27 led to the uncontrollable flow of oil from gas well 5 -- causing extensive damage to biodiversity and wildlife the region, according to a preliminary report on the environmental damage caused by the incident. The wildlife in the region includes, among several other species, the endangered hoolock gibbons and the Gangetic dolphins.There are 17 oil wells and five gas wells in the Baghjan oil field, Baghjan oil field generates 1,200 kilolitres of crude oil per day and 1.5 to 2 million metric standard cubic metres per day of gas. OIL supplies crude oil to several refineries including Digboi refineries in Assam, it also supplies gas to various power companies and fertiliser companies and 400+ tea estates according to OIL.The letter issued to OIL — a copy has been reviewed by HT — states that the Baghjan oilfield in Assam’s Tinsukia district is located at a distance of only 500 metres from the Maguri-Motapung wetland, which is a part of the eco-sensitive zone of Dibru Saikhowa National Park, which is “severely affected” by OIL’s “negligence”.According to the letter, OIL was required to take adequate measures to prevent spillage of hazardous waste into water bodies through designated drains and treatment facilities. The environment clearance granted to OIL was also on the condition that the company install a blowout prevention system to avoid accidents during drilling. “But you have failed to do it,” the letter stated.“It is observed that you have been operating your production as well as drilling installations without being equipped with proper safety and precautionary measures for which major accidents are occurred at the drilling sites,” the letter added.The board has sweeping powers over projects in eco-sensitive zones under Section 5 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986.“We have ordered complete closure because of their negligent behaviour,” DN Das, member secretary of the Assam Pollution Control Board, said.An OIL spokesperson said the consent was already sought. “We have applied for consent to operate a number of times, and even deposited fee for it with the pollution control board. The consent has come through for certain installations, rest are pending,” said Tridiv Hazarika.“The PCB had mailed us on June 11 asking us for details of various permissions and data. We had asked for time to reply. It’s a 15-year-old oil field. We managed to send them a response on June 18 but got a closure notice on June 19. It’s not technically possible to close the wells immediately as it will affect reservoirs. Many industries are dependent on OIL for their operations. We are also considering a legal option for a stay on the closure order,” the spokesperson added.Later on Sunday, OIL issued a press release saying it intends to file a writ petition before the Gauhati high court challenging the pollution control board order. It also said that an environment impact assessment study of the blowout and fire was pending.A preliminary report on the damage, by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) found that oil had leaked into the principal stream of Lohit river, polluting the water and the adjoining Maguri-Motapung wetland. “The toxic fumes and oil coating have universally affected flora and fauna. The contaminants and oil are continuing to be released and immediate steps are needed to contain this spill over. The toxins released are known to have long-term persistence in soils and sediments,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/closure-notice-to-assam-gas-field-over-blowout/story-FcRaEKbfyRuq1z1RuIjx1H.html
22-06-2020||India||Hectic backroom parleys on to save Manipur’s BJP-led govt||The Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition scrambled to save its government in Manipur Sunday with two senior leaders flying into Imphal to talk to rebel legislators whose resignation pushed the alliance to the brink of collapse late last week. Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma and senior Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma arrived in the afternoon on a chartered flight. Sarma played a crucial role in cobbling together the coalition after the 2017 assembly election and is the convenor of the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), of which Sangma’s National People’s Party (NPP) is a part. A senior leader said that the two leaders met the rebel NPP leaders to convince them to come back into the BJP fold. Last Wednesday, nine MLAs-- three from BJP, all four from NPP, one from the Trinamool Congress and one independent -- withdrew support to the N Biren Singh government. The BJP lawmakers later joined the Congress but it is not clear whether they will attract proceedings under the anti-defection law.A new coalition led by the Congress, called the Secular Progressive Front, has staked claim to power. “I heard Sangma and Sarma are in Imphal today. Their presence will have no impact even if the CM is replaced. The only solution is Congress-led SPF government,” Manipur Congress spokesperson Ningombam Bupenda Meitei said.In 2017, the Congress won 28 seats and the BJP 21, but the latter quickly cobbled together a coalition and staked claim to power. Later, eight Congress rebels joined the BJP. In the 60-member House, the BJP has 18 members, and the Congress has 20. The BJP currently enjoys the support of four Naga People’s Front legislators and one Lok Janshakti Party member. The fate of seven rebel MLAs who joined BJP from the Congress hangs in the balance after the Manipur high court barred them from the assembly until the speaker took a call on their disqualification. An eighth member resigned after a Supreme Court order.

We can work with more agility, attention and concentration, being full of positive energy and in good health by practising Yoga. Pls practise yoga every day and be healthy” was the message posted with the photo on Kamal Nath’s twitter handle @OfficeOfKNath.The same photo was posted on International Yoga Day last year when he was the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh.“Did you not practise yoga this year? You posted last year’s photo”, commented a Twitter user @yashsheopur in his reaction.Another Twitter user said, “It means Kamal Nath ji is busy in Yoga since last one year.”The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19BJP didn’t lose time in taking a dig at the state Congress president.In his satirical comment, state BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “Perhaps Kamal Nath couldn’t get his photograph snapped this year. That’s why he posted his photo from last year.”State Congress president’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja said, “The photo posted on Kamal Nath ji’s office’s Twitter handle, to congratulate people in the state and also the country on the International Yoga Day on Sunday, was symbolic. It was not mentioned anywhere that the photo was taken on Sunday. But BJP leaders, who are expert in fake news and dirty politics, began the smear campaign to mislead people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kamal-nath-trolled-for-posting-one-year-old-yoga-photo-on-social-media/story-9g2nTD2AEelmN9vZP7f5UN.html
22-06-2020||India||Some states plan to cancel contracts with Chinese firms||Some states have started planning to cancel contracts with Chinese companies and instructed personnel to remove China-made apps from mobile phones amid growing clamour to boycott goods produced by the neighbouring country after clashes in Ladakh left 20 soldiers dead. On Saturday, Haryana annulled two tenders for installation of flue gas de-sulphurization (FGD) system at their thermal power plants at Hisar and Yamunanagar. The works under the two tenders carried a financial implication of about Rs 780 crore, Haryana government officials said, adding that more contracts with Chinese firms would be cancelled in the next few days.Uttar Pradesh took a similar tough line. “Uttar Pradesh will not purchase any Chinese stuff for its energy sector,” said state power minister, Shrikant Sharma. “We will see to it that even the vendors do not supply any goods that are made wholly in China or use any part of it made in China,” he said on Friday. His counterpart looking after industrial development in UP, Satish Mahana, however, said on Sunday that ending contracts with Chinese companies can have legal implications. “Such things (cancellation of Chinese contracts) cannot happen overnight as such deals have legal issues,” he said.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar expressed strong sentiments against the use of Chinese goods but his government has not issued any specific order in this regard. “There is need for reviewing previous trade agreements in a bid to ensure that Chinese products are not used,” Kumar had said at the all-party meeting called by PM Narendra Modi. Bihar industry minister, Shyam Rajak, said there was no role of the state government in banning Chinese products. “Any foreign firms investing in the state has to get clearances from the Centre,” he said.On Sunday, Uttarakhand government instructed officials to find out which Chinese companies have been given government contracts. Madan Kaushik, cabinet minister and spokesperson Uttarakhand government, said he instructed officials to check whether the state government has signed any contracts with Chinese authorities or companies in the past. “After we find whether there are any contracts and if there are, what sort of contracts we have, we will take a decision on whether to cancel them or not,” he said.Maharashtra government officials said the Centre will have to formulate a policy on investment from Chinese companies before states can decide.“As far as foreign direct investment (FDI) is concerned, Chinese investment is allowed in manufacturing, service and real estate sector. If we have to ban them, then the decision has to come from the central government because we need a uniform policy,” said Bhushan Gagrani, principal secretary, appointed as state coordination officer to attract investment in the state.Officials in several governments such as West Bengal, Odisha and Rajasthan, said no decision was taken to ban Chinese products. “The decision to ban Chinese companies can only be taken by the Centre. Why doesn’t the BJP government snap all trade relations with China? Moreover, no Chinese company has base in West Bengal,” said Dola Sen, Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha MP.UP and Madhya Pradesh police have issued orders asking their personnel to remove Chinese apps from their phones.The UP Special Task Force on Friday ordered its staffers to uninstall 52 mobile apps of Chinese origin, pointing that these applications could be used to extract information from their mobile phones and those of their family members. MP police on Friday issued an order instructing all officials to delete 52 Chinese apps from their mobile phones. However, DIG Harinarayanchari Mishra, in another order, on Saturday clarified that deleting the apps was an advisory and not a mandatory requirement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-states-plan-to-cancel-contracts-with-chinese-firms/story-J6HWe3s0ts1Qv0PHdIodsO.html
22-06-2020||India||DoT to set up committee to review 4G tender specifications||The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) will set up a six-member committee to decide on the tender specifications to upgrade government-owned telecommunications companies BSNL and MTNL’s 4G services, officials familiar with the development said. The move comes shortly after Chinese troops killed 20 Indian soldiers close to the Line of Actual Control, and the central government thereafter instructed BSNL to not use Chinese equipment for the upgrade, which is likely to cost ₹7,000-8,000 crore. The new process will likely disqualify Chinese companies, an official said.The DoT official said the committee will be headed by a senior DoT official and will have a representatives from BSNL and MTNL, two independent experts and another representative from the industry.“The deliberations will start on Monday and new tenders are likely to be issued later next week”, said a DoT official. “Formal orders for cancellation of procurement of equipment from China will also be issued on Monday.” The official said they will encourage procurement of domestic equipment and technology. “The Indian sector will aim to become atmanirbhar,” the official mentioned above said, referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s urge to industries to become self-reliant.According to Mahesh Uppal, a consultant on telecom regulation: “India may be the second largest producers of mobile phones, but 75% of the internal components come from China, that will make it difficult to make the sudden switch,” Uppal said. The five key players in the electronics manufacturing, he said, are Ercisson, Nokia, Samsung, Huawei and ZTE, with the last two being Chinese companies. Huawei was also due to participate in the 5G spectrum trials, which are still at the proposal stage, according to DoT officials. The presence of Chinese equipment, said Uppal, is fairly “ubiquitous” in the market. Another DoT official said that the specifications that will be mentioned in the tender process will be “realistic”.“We will bear in mind the capabilities of the service providers in competition. They will also be futuristic, as it will be the entry point into 5G requirements,” the official said.Separately, the DoT is also in consultation with private telecom service providers to encourage the use of equipment manufactured in India. “These consultations will commence in the latter part of the week,” the official said. Former DoT advisor (technology) R K Bhatnagar said that the Indian sector was equipped to handle the challenge. “The Centre for Development of Telematics, the government’s research and development think-tank for telecom, can be the key player on Core Network and their solution will be upgradable to 5G also in coming months. In the last decade they have done technology transfer covering multiple products and that too to multiple private and government (PSU) players.” Bhatnagar added that under the Government funding and Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order of 2017, domestic manufacturers have are given an advantage. “Domestic industries are given preference under the act,” Bhatnagar said. “In case the bids are higher, they are asked to match the lowest bid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dot-to-set-up-committee-to-review-4g-tender-specifications/story-vzK0j47tzjbfSagcPvrMCM.html
22-06-2020||India||3 staggered clashes took place in Galwan Valley||Details emerging from the debriefing of Indian soldiers involved in the brutal Galwan Valley skirmish shine fresh light on the heroism of outnumbered Indian soldiers who fought off numerically superior rivals, string together the tactics of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and provide a clearer picture of how the clash unfolded on June 15, people familiar with developments said on Sunday. The seven-hour deadly conflict --- involving three staggered clashes --- along the undefined Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh saw the Indian soldiers put up a fierce fight against Chinese troops who had been pulled out of another sector and freshly deployed on the disputed border to carry out the premeditated attack at a time when a de-escalation plan was being implemented, said one of the persons cited above, asking not to be identified.There was no official word from the army on the new details of the clash.The Galwan Valley skirmish resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers, including a commanding officer, and the Chinese army possibly suffered more than twice the casualties, as stated by Union minister General VK Singh (retd) in a TV interview on Saturday. It was the first deadly conflict between Indian and Chinese soldiers along the LAC in 45 years.The first wave of fighting erupted at around 6pm after Colonel B Santosh Babu, the commanding officer of the 16 Bihar, led a squad of around 30 soldiers to a location near Patrol Point 14 (PP14) to verify if the Chinese soldiers had removed some of the installations they had erected in the area, after an understanding was reached at a meeting between senior military commanders on June 6, said the first person cited above.The squad, however, found that the tents and an observation post were still intact and the Chinese soldiers had not retreated. The number of Chinese troops at this location was around 20, including their commanding officer, he said. The Indian squad confronted the Chinese troops but the latter refused to remove their installations and vacate the area, leading to a scuffle in which Colonel Babu was pushed around, the person said. The manhandling of the colonel enraged the Indian troops who thrashed the Chinese soldiers and forced them to retreat towards PP14, a second person said.Babu and his men burnt down the Chinese tents and dismantled the observation post that was within the Indian side of the LAC.“The Indian squad found something was amiss as the Chinese colonel and the troops they had confronted minutes ago were totally unfamiliar. Rival soldiers patrolling the same areas can recognise each other. These were new faces. The Chinese PLA had sent in soldiers from some other area to carry out a pre-planned assault that would soon unfold,” he said. Soldiers familiar with each other are less likely to engage in a brutal conflict like the one that would play out in the dark a couple of hours later, he said. “The wily tactics of the Chinese were at play and Babu sensed it right away,” he added.The Indian squad called in for reinforcements and decided to patrol up to PP14 to check what the Chinese troops were up to and if they had pulled back to their side of the LAC. Now in command of around 80 soldiers, including a few officers, Babu led the squad right up to PP14 where the Chinese soldiers had gathered in large numbers, taken vantage positions and armed themselves with stones, iron rods and nail-studded clubs, the first person said.The Indian squad would soon face off with around 250 rival soldiers who were fully prepared for a dirty fight that night.“The second round of fighting began here. Babu and two others were fatally hit by Chinese soldiers and they fell into the river. The Chinese may not have known that they had struck the Indian commanding officer,” he said.However, the moment the Indian soldiers realised that Babu had fallen, they fought against the Chinese soldiers with all their might and killed 16 of them and inflicted life-threatening injuries on scores of others in a fearsome counter attack, the person said. Commanding officers in the army are regarded “father figures” who command immense respect and loyalty. India suffered all of its 20 casualties in the second of fighting.A lull in fighting allowed both sides to call for reinforcements before the soldiers engaged in the final wave of fighting that involved around 600 soldiers on both sides, with the Chinese PLA deploying more than 400 troops in that skirmish, the person said. The bodies of the troops who perished in the skirmish were exchanged the next day. The Indian soldiers were carrying weapons and ammunition but did not open fire as they were following border agreements between the two countries, the government said last week, following a political controversy over whether the Indian soldiers were carrying weapons that could have been used to defend themselves.Apart from 16 Bihar, the Indian soldiers involved in the clash were from 3 Punjab, 3 Medium Regiment and 81 Field Regiment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-staggered-clashes-took-place-in-galwan-valley/story-P1tT2X2fWaJu7smOHXEE0I.html
22-06-2020||India||‘Will pay back, inch by inch’: BJP sets tone for Bengal assembly polls, it’s violent||Marking a radical change in public posture, the Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has adopted aggression since Friday, with use of words such as revenge and payback causing discomfort for the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 seats, marking the party’s highest ever growth in Bengal. Violence has marked all recent elections and the crucial Assembly elections in 2021 are unlikely to be an exception. “If another party worker of ours is touched we will burn down the Danton police station,” BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu said at a demonstration in West Midnapore district on Saturday, triggering a strong reaction. Basu made the inflammatory remark in the presence of BJP state president Dilip Ghosh. The duo led the agitation to condemn the murder of a local party worker.In what is being seen as a chain reaction, Basu’s convoy was obstructed in Hooghly district by agitating TMC workers on Sunday. “Since the last panchayat polls, 104 BJP workers have been murdered in Bengal. Had I not stopped the angry people in West Midnapore, all policemen present at the spot would have been lynched. Police stations have become TMC offices. We will pay back, inch by inch” said Basu.Significantly, the aggression in BJP’s approach surfaced on Friday when Ghosh tweeted a new slogan: “Badla o hobe, badal o hobe.” (There will be revenge as well as change). The slogan appeared with Ghosh’s photo and a map of West Bengal.With all eyes fixed on the Assembly polls, the new slogan became a direct reply to Banerjee’s slogan before the historic 2011 polls in which she overthrew the 34-year-old Left govt. “Badla noi, badal chai” (We need change, not revenge) Banerjee had said, implying that if TMC came to power it would not seek revenge for the political killings during the Left regime headed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist).Also Watch: Covid & bickering within BJP: Himachal CM Jairam Thakur faces twin battleBy raising a completely different slogan with the same words, Ghosh wants to fan aggression, said political observers. Ghosh, however, stood his ground. “People understand only the language they speak. Cowards talk of forgiveness. Only violence can be the reply to violence,” Ghosh told reporters on Sunday on the sidelines of a World Yoga Day event. Though Ghosh referred to China, his statement was read with a different connotation altogether. “BJP is like the Jaish-e-Mohammed. They are terrorists. People should keep them out. They will destroy Bengal,” quipped the mayor of Kolkata and urban development minister Firhad Hakim.“Ghosh’s new slogan will definitely increase violence. It is time to observe how voters react to it,” said Tapas Roy, minister of state for parliamentary affairs.“These are signs of insanity. Mamata Banerjee came to power saying there would be no badla or revenge but she did just the opposite. The same TMC people who perpetrated violence are now with the BJP,” said Sujan Chakraborty, CPI(M) legislator from Jadavpur and leader of the Left Front in the Assembly.Incidentally, on June 9, Union home minister Amit Shah sharpened his attack on the chief minister, saying that while democracy has strengthened its roots in the entire country West Bengal remains the only state where political violence is propagated. Shah made the remark during his ‘West Bengal Jan Samvad’ virtual rally. Paying homage to party workers who lost their lives since 2014, he said, “I pay my respect to their families as they’ve contributed to the development of Sonar Bangla (golden Bengal).”BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said, “Banerjee’s slogan ‘Badla noi, badal chai’ gave an assurance of peace to people who were tired of the CPI(M)’s politics of violence. TMC came to power as a savior of the masses but eventually betrayed them. People are tired of this violence. BJP wants to establish peace and development.” “Ghosh’s slogan does not reflect a politically civilised attitude. The common man wants peace above everything else. Voters don’t expect their representatives to propagate violence,” said Udayan Bandopadhyay, a Kolkata-based professor of political science.Before coming to power in 2011, Mamata Banerjee promised to end political violence but killings and turf wars continued.The 2018 panchayat polls saw a spate in violence. While only 10 people died on the day of polling, against an all-time high of 76 in 2003 and 39 in 2013, the elections stood out because of rigging, booth capturing and burning of ballot papers in front of the media and policemen. More people were killed after the elections.TMC, which won 34 % of the panchayat seats uncontested, was blamed for resorting to violence because the state election commission had been asked by the Calcutta high court and the Supreme Court to ensure free and fair elections. The poll results triggered the rise of the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-pay-back-inch-by-inch-bjp-sets-tone-for-bengal-assembly-polls-it-s-violent/story-fT9oS7PqzdOGCI5wKOOP7I.html

22-06-2020||Today's||India has closed military gap with China along border||India has the upper hand in military deployments along its border with China, says a recent Harvard University assessment. If the Chinese attacked, co-author Frank O’Donnell of the US Naval War College told HT, “due to the larger permanent military presence of Indian forces vis-a-vis Chinese forces along the border areas, India would eventually be able to force China back across the LAC, although casualties would be extremely high on both sides.” One unknown in such a conflict would be China’s ability to use cyberattacks to disable Indian communications and logistics. Over the past dozen years India has not only closed the gap with China in this military theatre, it may now have a slender superiority. Indian officials largely concur with this view though prefer to stress India does not enjoy a position of complete dominance. Chinese military assessments began recognizing this problem from the mid-2000s and this may have contributed its border belligerence. Also read: India deploys specialised mountain forces to check China’s LAC transgressionsIndia and China have a similar number of soldiers along the border, a little over 200,000 each, but a portion of Chinese troops are reserved for the Russian border and handling insurgents in Tibet and Xinjiang. India holds a slight edge in fighter aircraft numbers but, more importantly, its Su-30s are superior to any Chinese fighters in the area and its base network allows it to better survive the missile exchanges that would follow. “India has more and better aircraft along the border, more experienced air crews, as well as a resilient basing position,” says O’Donnell.“China is regularly operating with a permanent Indian conventional force advantage along its border areas,” says the report. It notes this is not “typically acknowledged” in Indian debates and optimists regarding the military balance against China were “a minority” in India. For decades, going by the People’s Liberation Army’s journal, Science of Military Strategy, India was rated only as China’s number four external security concern. This has begun to change. The China National Defence Daily by 2013 spoke of India’s “surge of forces” along the border. A 2017 Nanfang Daily survey of Chinese strategic thinkers said some were worrying that “the defensive strategy of the Indian Army has shifted . . . toward the offensive.” Two Chinese experts on territorial issues warned in 2014 that “keeping our military’s advantage in the Sino-Indian border area is not only a national defense requirement, but also to prevent China from being disadvantaged in border negotiations.” There is more literature in the Chinese language about India catching up in terms of military infrastructure and force deployment after the Doklam crisis, says General G. L. Narasimhan Rao, head of the Centre for the Study of Contemporary China. Also read: Situation along LAC tense with full army deploymentIndia is far from being in a position of military preponderance. Indian defence officials point to the “touch and go nature” of the mountain environment means a numerical advantage in men and aircraft can be wiped out by inclement weather. China keeps most of its military firepower along its Pacific coast and would almost certainly redeploy to go for a “round two,” warns O’Donnell. M. Taylor Fravel, an MIT professor who has written on China’s border policies, says that “China has just over 10 percent of its ground forces [in its western theatre], a very large part of the country, and not even all these troops are focused on India.” But because China does not want to deploy a large fraction of its forces in Tibet or Xinjiang, he added, “I think this disparity in the local balance makes China especially sensitive to changes that improves India’s position.” Did India’s steady military improvement trigger Beijing is harder to ascertain. O’Donnell thinks China’s greater border aggression is a general trend evident in its behaviour with all its neighbours and not just about India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/india-has-closed-military-gap-with-china-along-border/story-aMltn7t0MQWqdagqdXoBEJ.html
22-06-2020||Editorials||On China, put India first | HT Editorial||India should react to China’s act of aggression in eastern Ladakh through all means at its disposal — economic, military, and diplomatic. That is a given and there can be no argument about it. None. That said, India should also ensure that everything it does is driven by self-interest above all else, particularly in the economic domain. There is a clamour for cancelling contracts given to some Chinese companies across areas such as engineering and construction. So, how should New Delhi go about this? It is easy to see why Chinese companies should be barred from all strategic areas — not just defence but also domains such as information technology and communications. There is a very opaque relationship between the private sector and the government in China and most Chinese private companies and entrepreneurs ensure their objectives are in sync with Beijing’s larger vision. In return, the Chinese government has supported these private companies, helping them grow and spread their network across the globe. In these areas, India’s answer, when it comes to participation by Chinese firms, should be a straightforward and unambiguous No. But the line can’t be as hard when it comes to other areas. As this newspaper has reported, India depends on China for several raw materials and intermediary products (or components). Chinese companies are good at heavy engineering. India would do well to tap this expertise and continue to keep these supply chains going in its own interest. Sure, it is always good to manufacture locally, but it won’t be possible to do so overnight. Even when it does become possible, it may not make economic sense in the case of some products. Nor, for that matter, does it make sense to say no to Chinese capital, as long as investments aren’t allowed in strategic areas and there continues to be a clear line between ownership (or beneficial ownership) and management. Over the past few days, some state governments have cancelled contracts issued to Chinese companies for largely non-strategic work. This is not a good idea for two reasons. One, doing so may result in protracted and expensive arbitration. Two, more important, most of these contracts were given out to the lowest bidder. Re-tendering those contracts may cause delays that India can ill-afford as it seeks to rebuild its economy. We must get back at the Chinese, but always driven by the principle of self-interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/on-china-put-india-first-ht-editorial/story-Zwmg305ch8ADVWpD75RZdP.html
22-06-2020||Editorials||Redesign the model village scheme | HT Editorial||A study commissioned by the Union ministry of rural development on the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY), launched by Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi in 2014, has said that the scheme has not made “any significant impact” and “is not achieving the desired purpose”. PM Modi had urged Members of Parliament (MPs) to adopt one or more villages in their constituency and turn them into “model villages”. While, in principle, SAGY is a good idea. But there are both political and structural flaws in its design. It fails to appreciate a ground reality. Any MP will find it difficult, if not impossible, to prioritise one village over another. A Lok Sabha MP represents, on an average, over 1.5 million voters of different castes, religion, gender and age groups, each with their own set of demands. For an MP to cherry-pick a few villages can be both politically counterproductive, and can disturb the delicate social equilibrium in villages/constituencies. Additionally, the scheme has no separate budgetary allocation and MPs are unwilling to allocate funds from the MP Local Area Development Scheme for projects in the model villages. However, with the Covid-19 pandemic wrecking lives and livelihoods, and spurring an exodus of labourers from cities to villages, a new and redesigned SAGY, with funding, can work. For this, expand the ambit from one village to a cluster of villages. Follow it up with mapping the skill sets of residents and upgrading/re-skilling them; investing in farm and related infrastructure such as cold chains and food processing units; and building critical infrastructure. This is politically more feasible for elected representatives, and can create economic opportunities within villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/redesign-the-model-village-scheme-ht-editorial/story-nHwbU4S2ZEtoijP0Acn73N.html
22-06-2020||Editorials||In the Covid-19 battle, Delhi turns to volunteers | HT Editorial||Last week, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal unveiled a scheme to involve non-governmental organisations (NGOs), volunteers, the National Cadet Corps and National Service Scheme Cadets, and scouts to join the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Asymptomatic individuals and those working for NGOs and within the 18-55 age bracket can join the effort. The volunteers will be deployed to survey suspected cases; strengthen surveillance and management of isolation cases; manage Covid-19 helplines; and assist senior citizens, among other steps. The capital is facing a crisis. With official figures projecting up to 532,000 Covid-19 cases by the end of July, Delhi needs to massively ramp up its testing and health infrastructure in terms of hospital beds, personal protective equipments, oxygen cylinders and ventilators. It will also need a much larger number of health care personnel. While there can be no substitute for the domain knowledge and skills that doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, and Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) bring to health care, in this time of crisis, additional deployment of personnel to assist is helpful. These volunteers from civil society must be used for two tasks in particular. The first is contact tracing, and the second is ensuring more rigorous surveillance for those in home isolation. Delhi needs all the hands it can get.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/in-the-covid-19-battle-delhi-turns-to-volunteers/story-fVr2TNJnqHaYZ58Kyd8BDP.html
22-06-2020||Editorials||Restoring India’s case, credibility | HT Editorial||On Saturday, the Prime Minister’s Office issued a much-needed clarification about Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s statement, on Friday, that there was no (external) presence in Indian territory. It said that PM was referring to the situation pertaining to the Galwan Valley, where Indian Army personnel had bravely foiled China’s attempts to erect structures and transgress on June 15. The clarification came a day after the PM’s statement, at an all-party meeting, created a political and diplomatic row. The original statement, read independently, had the potential of undermining India’s sovereign claims and its negotiating position, confusing India’s friends, providing diplomatic ammunition to China, and appearing contradictory to earlier positions of the external affairs and defence ministries. It also seemed contrary to reports about the situation in Pangong Tso — namely Chinese occupation of a central portion of the shore that was behind the Indian claims line, but is disputed and not under the sovereign control of either country. It also prompted other questions. If there had been no intrusion in Galwan Valley, what led to the violence on June 15? What is the restoration of status quo ante that India wants if there is no transgression? While the clarification has helped, Beijing will throw the original statement back at the Indian side during the coming negotiations. The considerable support India has overseas can potentially get eroded as friendly governments presume New Delhi is prepared to concede land. Domestically, the PM’s remark deepened political polarisation and led to accusations about government being less than transparent.The PM has been remarkably sure-footed in the international arena and Friday’s statement was not in character. It is impossible to know whether it was a slip, or whether it was a strategic message meant to China to offer room for quiet de-escalation, or whether it was a political counter to the Opposition’s critique that the Line of Actual Control (LAC) had been breached, or whether, as the clarification noted, it was only about Galwan Valley. But irrespective of the motivations, the message sent out an ambiguous signal. The PM must speak again, and categorically address three issues: on Chinese transgression across the LAC, if any, in recent months; whether China is attempting to change the facts on the ground in Pangong Tso; and the current status in Galwan Valley. It is important to establish that the area that India has always claimed as its own is firmly under Indian control. There is sometimes value to strategic ambiguity in international politics. But this isn’t one of those. A new statement will help restore India’s stand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/restoring-india-s-case-credibility/story-7z1xwrSXDPk3MSVe5Qp7VP.html
