28-06-2020||News||How India is building its capabilities||India’s fight against Covid-19 has now reached a critical phase. We have gone through three successive lockdowns of decreasing intensity and now are well into the unlocking phase. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s vision has expanded from “preventing loss of life” to “saving lives and protecting livelihoods”. Despite this, there is a certain amount of fatigue among people who have seen their lives and livelihoods put on hold. The daily news and updates on Covid-19 have left the public exhausted even as the number of recoveries has surpassed the number of active cases across the country. On April 6, the PM warned that India’s battle against Covid-19 would be a long one and that the nation would have to come together in a tireless effort to emerge victorious. Even in the first 10 days of the lockdown, the PM was well aware of the scale of pandemic and economic cost to the nation. India’s early recognition of the seriousness of the pandemic allowed the government to prepare the health care infrastructure to deal with the rising number of cases. Therefore, it was imperative for the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to step up and build the foundation, protocol and infrastructure to test, track and treat cases.Countries across the world have had their methods of responding to the pandemic with varying degrees of success. However, the mantra of test, test, test has been a common denominator for all who have flattened the curve. ICMR too has worked towards this and steadily ramped up the country’s testing capacities to meet with the requirements of its huge population. The rapid progress in ramping up testing capacities has been in sync with the vision of “saving lives and protecting livelihoods”. We are now testing over 200,000 samples every day as we have validated over 1,000 laboratories covering every district. Just over a month ago, India’s daily testing capacity was 100,000 in 555 laboratories. In order to have inclusive and equitable access to testing, the strategy underwent iterative calibration to keep pace with the changing epidemiology and extent of infection. Keeping in mind the thousands of economic migrants returning to rural areas, ICMR worked with state governments to build more testing laboratories along with framing a strategy to monitor, investigate and treat new cases. While several Union ministries developed an economic stimulus and an unlocking plan to prevent the loss of livelihoods in the quest for an Atmanirbhar Bharat, ICMR was ensuring that the expertise, materials, staff and capacity to carry out testing safely, successfully and reliably were being put in place. ICMR’s Covid-19 programme has proved to be a flag-bearer of Atmanirbhar Bharat as the government has worked in close coordination with the domestic health care industry to make India self-sufficient in testing. Because of the nationwide lockdown, industries have faced severe operational challenges related to the movement of human resources and procurement of material and machinery. A task force was set up principally to deal with these challenges and help the industry to accelerate production. A case in point is the development of swabs for Covid-19, which was initiated within six days locally. Three companies can now manufacture up to 200,000 swabs per day. Despite the lockdown, the production of viral transport medium (VTM) kits was increased from 500,000 units per year to 500,000 units per day. After expedited approval from the Central Drug Standard Control Organisation, a private company has developed 10 million polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and five million viral extraction kits. In order to ensure that the supplies reached every laboratory in time, the services of the ministry of civil aviation and their airline partners in the government and private sector under “Mission Lifeline Udan” were availed. They carried ICMR consignments of diagnostic material across the country. In the last two months, approximately 40 tonnes of testing material were transported in more than 150 flight operations, reaching out to the remotest corners. Doorstep deliveries were coordinated with several courier companies and state governments. As the lab network expanded, India Post, which has countrywide operations, was roped in. To cut down transit times, logistical complications and risks of stock outs, decentralised storage of these supplies has been done by building a network of 16 storage depots in a phased manner. Along with the internationally accepted reverse transcription (RT)-PCR test kits, ICMR has also encouraged the use of indigenously developed TrueNAT and CBNAAT testing protocols, which are more cost-effective and can be more easily used in rural areas where migrants are returning. These efforts by ICMR, in collaboration with various state and central government ministries, have facilitated the construction of testing laboratories even in the remotest parts of the country, from Ladakh in the north to all the seven states of the Northeast, as well as the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep Islands down south. The construction of 1,000 laboratories capable of conducting 200,000 tests per day within three months has also ensured that the economic activity associated with the construction, procurement and staff for these has built an ecosystem that protects and provides livelihoods. More important, the scientific- and data-driven inputs from the country’s leading epidemiologists and scientists at ICMR have been also been instrumental in formulating the protocols for Unlock 1.0 to restart the economic engine. While our soldiers are securing the territorial integrity of the nation at the China-India border, the warriors at ICMR are saving the lives and protecting the livelihoods of those living in this territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-india-is-building-its-capabilities/story-iKOATWxpefLPpxUIvWb7UO.html
28-06-2020||News||Covid-19: Adopting a new method of teaching | Opinion||June and July herald the new academic year in India. The sight of smiling children trooping into schools is a joy to behold. This year, however, the Covid-19 pandemic has led to prolonged school closures with millions of children forced to stay home. The closure has led to learning losses far greater than the usual “summer loss” and this is likely to continue, leading to chronic learning deficits during schooling and economic losses as these children become adults.India already experiences a deeply-entrenched learning deficit (Annual Status of Education Report 2018 reports that less than one-third of children in class 3, and one-half of children in class 5, are able to read a class 2-level text), which the pandemic will exacerbate. Many states with low learning outcomes are also facing an influx of returning migrants, bringing with them children who now have to be enrolled in schools. These children may need more learning support as they cope with recent disruptions and need to acclimatise to the new learning environment.As governments deliberate on school reopening, there is a clamour among policymakers to reduce the curriculum. While this is laudable, it is not a good enough response as this assumes that children are learning at the appropriate grade level and the only problem to address is the reduction in instruction time. However, children who have experienced learning losses in the past months need targeted interventions to help them gain and retain foundational skills.One such intervention is Pratham’s Teaching at the Right Level programme. The idea behind the programme is deceptively simple — if children’s learning levels can be quickly and accurately assessed by the teacher, they can be grouped by level rather than by grade. Teachers can then provide instruction tailored to the students’ current learning levels. This will enable children to gain basic reading and arithmetic skills in a relatively short period of time.Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo led a team of J-PAL-affiliated researchers to evaluate versions of this programme. It has been found to be effective when delivered by volunteers in the community (Bihar) or by government teachers in schools as part of the school day (Haryana) or by Pratham staff supported by volunteers in an intensive short-duration camp programme (Uttar Pradesh). We found that almost twice as many children in class 3 to 5 exposed to the camp programme in Uttar Pradesh (UP) could read four-sentence texts, as compared to children who were not, bridging the gap between children in UP and Haryana, a state with significantly higher learning outcomes.The camp model may also be much more adaptable to the current situation with its unique demands on social distancing, integrating migrant children, and the ever-present threat of localised, targeted lockdowns. For example, the duration and frequency of camps can be varied to suit local conditions. Migrants who have returned can be recruited as volunteers to assist teachers, and children can be brought into schools based on their current learning level in reading or arithmetic (so there would be fewer children but with more homogenous abilities) in order to promote both social distancing and focused attention from teachers. In these uncertain times, children need some semblance of normalcy. A school programme tailored to suit their needs could be something that they can look forward to. A silver lining in the dark cloud of the pandemic is that it has demystified and strengthened the need for research and evidence. Isn’t it then fitting that we adopt a well-tested and proven programme to stem learning losses among children?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-adopting-a-new-method-of-teaching/story-8AhwWUzkttcDpobuoiqkoK.html
28-06-2020||Mumbai||Maha sees sharpest one-day case spike for 5th day in a row||The state on Sunday, for the fifth day in a row, recorded its sharpest single-day jump in Covid-19 cases with 5,493 more infections, even as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that the ongoing lockdown would not be lifted after June 30. The state case count went up to 164,626 and toll rose to 7,429 with the addition of 156 deaths on Sunday. Mumbai saw 1,287 more infections on Sunday, taking its total to 75,539. With the addition of 87 deaths, the toll of the city is 4,371. The state health department has, however, said that 60 of the fatalities added on Sunday were reported in the past two days, while the remaining 96 are from the past few weeks. Thackeray, who completed seven months as the CM on Sunday, said the ongoing lockdown will not be lifted after its fifth phase ends on June 30, although the government was mulling more relaxations under its ‘Mission Begin Again’ — a staggered plan to lift curbs.Thackeray said that as the government is opening up activities in a calibrated manner, cases are expected to rise in the coming days. Thackeray, in his address through Facebook live, said that the risk of Covid-19 and the battle against the virus has not passed yet, but the government is relaxing curbs in a phased manner. The state government is expected to decide on relaxations in industrial, commercial activities after the Central government issues its guidelines. Thackeray is scheduled to hold high-level meetings with his cabinet colleagues and top officials over the next two days. He also has warned that the government machinery will be forced to impose stricter lockdown curbs again if the guidelines were not followed by people. “I have been getting requests from a few civic authorities for permission to impose stricter lockdown, owing to the rising numbers. There are cases of violations of curbs in some cities such as Mumbai, Pune and even in rural areas. In case of violations of curbs, we will have no option, but to go for stricter imposition of lockdown in areas with rise in cases,” he said.Thackeray said that there will be a spike in infections in the next few weeks. “As we have been opening up activities to ensure the revival of the economy, we have been witnessing a rise in cases. As part of the relaxation, people step out of their homes, come in contact and spread the virus. Even in the near future, there will be a rise in cases as we open up more activities,” he said. State health department expects the rise in cases during July and August. “There will be a modulating trend in terms of cases for the next few weeks, before we expect the plateau in August,” the official said, requesting anonymity. After allowing salons and beauty parlours to open from Sunday in the fourth phase of Mission Begin Again, the state government is expected to extend more relaxations in transport facilities and industrial operations. It has also hinted at allowing more workforce in private and even government offices. State has been reporting more than 5,000 cases a day for the past three days. It has seen 32, 551 cases and 1,259 deaths in the past seven days, with a daily average of 4,650 cases and 180 deaths respectively. Mumbai’s growth of cases has comparatively improved as it reported 9,051 cases and 700 deaths during this period. State’s case fatality rate (CFR) dropped to 4.51% from 4.69% on June 16, the day on which there was an addition of 1,328 deaths as part of the reconciliation of data. The CFR was 3.79% on June 15. The recovery rate of the state has improved to 52.59% as 86,575 patients were reported to have recovered from the infection. Thackeray said that the state government is ready to take on the surge. “We have increased testing facilities. Instead of waiting for the virus to attack us, we have been chasing it. After it has proven successful in Mumbai, the ‘chase the virus’ drive is being implemented elsewhere in the state. It will help us in containing the spread. The government has received permission from the Centre for the use of remdesivir and favipiravin, the antiviral drugs, and they will be made available to citizens free of cost once adequate stock is procured,” he said. Thackeray said that the government was inaugurating plasma therapy testing centres in Maharashtra on Monday and it will, perhaps, help us Maharashtra become the top state to provide the facility with the highest number of tests for the therapy. We appeal to people who recovered from the infection to come forward for the test of therapy so that other patients can benefit from them,” he said. The CM also appealed to doctors from the private sector to come forward and guide their colleagues from the healthcare sector to treat patients effectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-sees-sharpest-one-day-case-spike-for-5th-day-in-a-row/story-3wE3vEjFJlFu5m3uJn1CsN.html

28-06-2020||Mumbai||Senior citizen loses valuables worth ₹5 lakh in house break-in||Police on Saturday arrested two persons accused of a house break-in in an upscale society at Bandra. The arrested accused have been identified as Mukesh Gavde, 25, and Kunal Mhadik, 27, both residents of Khar Danda.According to Bandra police, on June 8, the accused broke the lock of the flat and stole gold, silver ornaments, and foreign currency worth a total of ₹5 lakh.“On June 23 morning, when one of the neighbours saw the broken lock, he informed the owner who had gone away to his hometown in Gujarat to his son due to the lockdown. The owner is a senior citizen,” said an officer from Bandra police station.“The family of the senior citizen contacted us and a first information report [FIR] against unknown persons under sections 380 (theft in dwelling house), 454 (house trespass) and 457 (house trespass in night) of the Indian Penal Code was registered,” said the officer.While scanning the CCTV footage of the society, police discovered that three persons had entered the building and after the heist, they left on a bike. Police were able to use the bike registration number to nab two of the accused and are on the lookout for the third accomplice. The accused are career criminals and have more than 22 cases registered against them in western suburbs, said the officer.Thieves target sleeping security guardsIn another incident, Bandra police on Friday arrested two members of a gang that targeted security guards of upscale societies and stole their mobile phones.

28-06-2020||City||Man who lost roof in cyclone gets help now||Weeks after Cyclone Nisarga that hit Humgaon, a village in Karjat taluka, around 56 kilometres away from Kalyan, and swept away the roof and door of the house of a 40-year-old physically challenged man, the man received help to repair his house. After a video went viral on social media, Kalyan rural team of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) reached out and helped the man with repairs.Cyclone Nisarga had made its landfall around 100 km south of Alibaug, a resort town in the coastal district of Raigad, on June 3. The cyclone had also impacted Margaon, Khopoli and Karjat where trees were uprooted and electric lines were damaged.“The wind destroyed my house. It blew off the roof and damaged the door. I had approached the gram panchayat several times, but did not get any help. People visited my house and assured me of help, but nothing was done all these weeks,” said Ananta (Anna) Katkari, the sole resident of the house.Maruti Badge, 65, a retired teacher who lives nearby, shot a video of the house seeking help and posted it on social media. Badge, in the video, also claimed that the man is the son of late Ramu Maniya Katkari, a soldier.“I have known the family for a long time and was saddened to see the state of a soldier’s son. He lives alone in the house. His brother who lives nearby and other residents give him food regularly. I felt bad as he was living in the house without any roof and door even amid rain,” said Bagde.The video showed the house without a roof and door while the floor was flooded with rain water. All of Katkati’s belongings were also drenched in water.“He is physically challenged and has no work to do. He had been seeking help from the authorities but nobody paid any heed. So, I decided to shoot a video and post it on social media so that someone comes forward to help him,” added Bagde.As the video went viral on social media, members of MNS’s Kalyan rural unit came across it and contacted the teacher. “I saw the video and thought of visiting the place to see the condition. The house was completely damaged with no roof and the man was staying inside even during rain. We decided to help him out with the roof and the door. We have also asked the workers to clean the house so that we can places tiles and some basic appliances like bulb and fan,” said Ashwin Bhoir, president of MNS’s Kalyan rural unit.“The village is in a remote place and falls under gram panchayat rule. When we asked the sarpanch about why the house was not repaired, they cited lack of funds,” added Bhoir.A representative of the gram panchayat on condition of anonymity said, “We had visited the house and were looking for social groups to come forward to help as we could not take up the work due to lack of funds.”Vikram Deshmukhm, tehsildar of Karjat taluka, said, “Followed by Cyclone Nisarga, a survey was carried out about losses in the taluka. Those who suffered losses were provided with money in their accounts. We have distributed around ₹3.5 crore. We will check the list and look into this particular case of the Katkari family. If they need help, we will do the needful at the earliest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-who-lost-roof-in-cyclone-gets-help-now/story-dZbjQz11sbDcLLl9Wd1FGL.html
28-06-2020||Delhi||Bars that brought Connaught Place back to nightlife face closure||It was a dream come true for Ashish Ahuja, when in 2014, he opened Pebble Street, a restro-bar, in Connaught Place. But last month, he shut down the outlet, famed for its European ambience, roasted lamb leg, and Long Island Iced Tea.“With high rents and the current restrictions on operations due to the Covid pandemic, it became unsustainable to run the establishment; besides, I did not see things improving in the next few months. We were left with no choice,” says Ahuja who owns another outlet with a similar name in New Friends Colony. About a dozen restaurant, bars and cafes, have exited Connaught Place and industry sources say 50 others are on the verge of shut down because of high rents, new guidelines of reduced operating hours and ban on serving alcohol. Kuldeep Singh Chauhan, a real estate agent in Connaught Place, who works with restaurant owners, say negotiations between the landlord and the businessmen, who want to rent to be waived off and shift to revenue-sharing model, have reached a dead end. “As many as 20 restro-bar owners have already conveyed to their landlords that they are shutting. They have approached me to help them in finding buyers for their set-up such as kitchen and furniture,” says Chauhan.“A majority of landlords have served legal notices for failing to pay rent for the past three months. Restaurants are paying anything between ₹6 lakh to ₹20 lakh a month in CP depending on the size of the property,” says Dinesh Arora, president, Delhi Restaurants & Clubs Association, who also owns Unplugged Courtyard, a popular restro-bar in Connaught Place. “Half of the restro-bars in CP will shut in the next couple of months.”Raising the Bar Many believe so many restro-bars going bust is bad news for Connaught Place, which has undergone a great revival in the past few years. Inaugurated in the 1930s, CP had fallen out of favour with Delhiites by the late 1990s, what with the chaos caused by Metro construction. By 2004, Connaught Place had become a decrepit place, its walls pan-stained, its shops deserted and beggars roaming in its worn- out corridors.Things began to look up after the Metro started operations in 2005, and by 2016, Connaught Place was once again the city’s centre of gravity. Many believe that its brand new chic cafes, restaurants, and bars played a key role in reviving CP and transforming Delhi’s image from a staid capital city to one with a happening nightlife.While CP’s iconic legacy restaurants such as United Coffee House and Embassy were going strong as ever, the arrival of QBA in 2003, marked a major milestone in CP’s journey to become a major food and beverage hub, a decade later.“Those were the days when people were beginning to eat out, and we felt there was a space in CP for a new contemporary, multi-cuisine restro-bar that appealed to the young. We hired an architect from Thailand and a chef from Australia,” says Aditya Jain, who started QBA. “It was an instant hit, attracting a lot of young upwardly customers, a lot of them from east and west Delhi,” adds Jain, whose extended family owns Jainson and Greenways, two of the oldest establishments in CP. Jain is luckier than others as he owns the property and says he will reopen QBA as soon on as it is safe to do so.New cafes, restaurants and bars kept coming up after QBA, mostly in the outer circle , but the real restaurant boom in CP began in 2014, after its renovation was completed. Over 100 new restaurants, bars and cafes came up by 2017—mostly on the first and second floors that had been lying empty for many years. “One of the reasons why CP became such a hot destination for food and beverage ventures was that it provided a lot of scope for outdoor dining, with its terraces providing beautiful views. Authorities should allow outdoor dining, which is now key to enhancing capacity while ensuring social distancing,” says Priyank Sukhija, who owns seven restro-bars in Connaught Place, including Lord of the Drinks, Warehouse Café, Open House Café, all of which have remained shut since March. He opened five restro-bars between 2013 and 2017 in CP.Al fresco dining in Connaught Place was banned in 2017 , with the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) cracking down on restaurants, bars and cafés for using terraces in the wake of a building collapse in 2017. Sukhija says he employed 500 people in CP outlets. “Closure of the restro-bars in CP will not only rob the city of its nightlife, but also thousands of jobs.The crowd- pullersRestaurants in CP, Arora says, provides jobs to over 8,000 people and contribute to the footfall, giving a boost to retail. “On an average, 250 people visited my restaurant on weekdays and around 350 on weekends. So, my restaurant alone brought 10,000 people to CP every month. You can imagine the number of footfall all the 150 restaurants were contributing, ” he adds.Retailers agree. “ A lot of my customers before Covid-19 were indeed those who came to the restaurants here, which have played an important role in re-energising CP,” says Satish Sundra, who runs the city’s oldest toyshop in CP. He says CP’s story has once again taken a sad turn. “Covid-19 has killed business here like never before. In the 1960s, there was a slump in business in CP because many neighbourhood markets such as Khan Market and GK came up; and then in the early 2000s, but things were never as bad as they are now.”Atul Bhargav, president of NDTA ( New Delhi Traders Association), which represents traders of Connaught Place echoes his views, “Restaurant owners and shopkeepers have had a symbiotic relationship in CP,” says Bhargav. Currently, he is busy facilitating the shoot of a short promotional movie that will showcase what CP traders are doing to make shopping a safe experience in the colonial shopping arcade.Experts feel that the cororonavirus pandemic is going to bring about a ‘churn’ in CP. “ Many of the fashion stores will move out; and CP would see food & beverage ventures in a new format such as high-end liquor stores. Besides, there could be many electronic stores, a segment which is currently doing very well. A high-street like CP will recover soon as it is possible to control the store environment there,” says Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock, a retail and real estate services company.The third spaceMany feel restaurants, bars and cafes in CP play an important role in the city’s business, social, intellectual and artistic life. “Besides, many people are emotionally attached to restaurants and cafes , where they make business deals and celebrate events of life such as birthdays and marriage anniversaries,” says Archana Singh, who runs TravelSeeWrite, a popular travel blog.“I mostly write my blogs in Khan Market and CP restaurants. These places are not just about food and drink, they also fulfill a human need for connection in a big city like Delhi. Their closure will diminish the experience of both CP and the city.”But Prof Vivek Kumar, who teaches sociology at JNU, has a different take. “ If anything, these new restro-bars in CP are merely an important marker of Delhi’s economic progress and its embrace of western modernity, nothing more, nothing less,” he says.Ashish Ahuja of Pebble Street sounds a warning. “Everyone, the landlords and the authorities, need to understand that it is restro-bars, and not retail that revived CP, and without them CP will once again lose its mojo.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bars-that-brought-connaught-place-back-to-nightlife-face-closure/story-qCKJ5n5pbVitR6wtrI4pRJ.html

28-06-2020||Mumbai||3 of family booked over dowry death, abetting suicide of 31-year-old woman||The police on Saturday booked a man and his parents from Chembur on charges of dowry death and abetment of suicide after his 31-year-old wife died last Monday. The woman in her suicide note held her husband and in-laws responsible. Her family has also alleged foul play. The preliminary post-mortem report showed she was Covid-19 positive.According to Chembur police, the woman allegedly killed herself on June 22 at their flat in a plush residential society in Chembur. The first information report (FIR), a copy of which is with HT, stated the woman from Kutch, Gujarat, had come in contact with the accused man in 2014 through a matrimonial site. Both of them were divorcees and got married in February 2015 in Mumbai.The woman’s mother, who is the complainant, alleged the accused family had first demanded ₹50 lakh dowry, but settled on ₹25 lakh after negotiation. However, later the accused family asked the woman to get ₹50 lakh from her family as her husband wanted to buy franchise of a popular fast food chain. She further alleged the woman was suffering from depression and was undergoing treatment . She had told her parents and elder sister about the torture and harassment she was undergoing at the hands of her husband and in-laws, the complaint states.The complainant alleged that her daughter’s husband would often assault her daughter. “He also assaulted her when she was pregnant, leading to her miscarriage,” she alleged.A day before she died by suicide, she had shared some messages on the family group indicating she was under stress. Shalini Sharma, senior inspector of Chembur police station, said, “Preliminary post-mortem report of the deceased woman revealed that she was Covid-19 positive. Initially an accidental death report (ADR) was registered, but after a suicide note was found and based on the complaint of the woman’s family, we have registered a case of dowry death and abetment of suicide against her husband and in-laws.” The investigation officer said it was not yet certain how the woman had contracted the virus. The final report, which is awaited, will reveal if there were any external or internal injury, Sharma said, adding no arrest has been made yet.Advocate Shoaib Memon, representing the complainant, said, “We have not performed last rites on the body as we want a thorough investigation.”The accused family was not available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-of-family-booked-over-dowry-death-abetting-suicide-of-31-year-old-woman/story-FBXsyOjvk8Xa38EZYlsieN.html

28-06-2020||Mumbai||Iskcon, a well-known trademark, apparel firm must not use it: HC||The Bombay high court on Friday declared ‘Iskcon’ to be the registered trademark of the religious organisation International Society for Krishna Consciousness and a ‘well-known mark in India’. The declaration implies that anyone found using the trademark, would be liable for prosecution and damages for infringement. The court issued the declaration while hearing a suit by the organisation, wherein, it had sought restraint on an apparel company from using the said trademark. The decree of ‘well known’ trademark is usually issued by the trademark registry.The bench of Justice BP Colabawalla, while hearing a commercial intellectual property suit filed by the religious organisation through advocates Hiren Kamod, Vaibhav Keni and Neha Iyer submitted that Iskcon Apparel Pvt. Ltd, sold its products online using the name Iskcon. This action of the company amounted to an infringement of the trademark registered in the name of the organisation.Kamod further submitted that the infringement by the apparel company came to light in February and as a repeated summons to the company went unanswered, the organisation approached the court seeking a permanent injunction restraining the company from using its trademark. Kamod referred to the plea which stated that after the summons was issued the company changed its name to Alcis Sports Pvt Ltd but continued to use the term Iskcon prominently in all their products.Referring to an organisation, Kamod submitted that Iskcon was established in 1966 in New York and had since created for itself a global presence that was not restricted to any particular goods, services or activities, but to a diverse range of categories. Kamod added that the organisation’s trademark had come to enjoy a personality that is beyond the scope of mere products, services rendered under the trademark.In light of these submissions Kamod said that as parameters for ‘well-known trademark’ as per the Trade Marks Act, 1999 were fulfilled in the present case, the court should declare it so.After perusing the material on record, the court opined that the plaintiff’s trademark satisfied requirements and tests as per sections 11(6) and 11 (7) of the Trade Marks Act and said “Since Iskcon is a coined mark which is exclusively associated with the plaintiff religious organisation, it undoubtedly deserves the highest degree of protection. The documents show that the trademark Iskcon has acquired immense and long-standing reputation and goodwill throughout India and it is associated with the plaintiff and none else.”Given the undertaking by apparel company, Justice Colabawalla perpetually restrained it from using the term Iskcon in any manner, passed a decree in favour of religious organisation and ruled, “In view thereof, I find no difficulty in holding that the plaintiff’s trademark Iskcon is a ‘well known’ trademark in India as per the Trade Marks Act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iskcon-a-well-known-trademark-apparel-firm-must-not-use-it-hc/story-goSn4AmeFgRUnUxD5JOP6J.html
28-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh BJP shares Modi govt’s achievements through virtual rally||Celebrating the completion of Modi’s government one year in office, the local unit of BJP organised a Virtual Jan Samvad Rally on Sunday to apprise city residents of the government’s achievements. Party workers pledged to support Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Atam Nirbhar Bharat campaign by using Indian products. Several residents joined the rally through various social media platforms. Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad addressed the virtual rally from Delhi BJP headquarters as the keynote speaker and Chandigarh BJP in-charge Prabhat Jha addressed the workers from Bhopal.Prasad said the central government under Modi’s leadership had done a lot of work for the public and transformed the nation through historic decisions. These included abrogation of Sections 370 and 35A in Jammu and Kashmir, ending triple talaq, amendment in the Citizenship Act and paving a way for the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya.Chandigarh BJP president Arun Sood said due to these decisions, 2019 will be known as “Saal Ek Kaam Anek - Badhe Faisle Kam Huye Faasle”.Sood said during the lockdown, the local BJP distributed 75,000 food packets daily through 52 community kitchens. The party also distributed 11,652 ration kits, 5 lakh face masks and 60,000 sanitisers, donated 588 blood units and also assisted the people of Ladakh by airlifting them to their native place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-bjp-shares-modi-govt-s-achievements-through-virtual-rally/story-9vkYNJBbFCsqtqtM2SxD3I.html
28-06-2020||Chandigarh||Intel warns of ISI, SFJ-sponsored pro-Khalistan activity in country||Amid the Covid-19 pandemic and recent military face-off on the India-China border in Ladakh, intelligence agencies have warned the government of pro-Khalistan activities in the country backed by Pakistan’s ISI spy agency and the banned Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) group. The warning, sources said, mentions that these anti-India activities are being guided by one ISI handler named Abdullah in close coordination with SFJ’s founder Avtar Singh Pannu, who is learnt to have been residing in the United Kingdom. Abdullah’s name was also revealed during questioning of three arrested suspected sympathisers of the Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF), who were planning to execute targeted killings in various northern states. The KLF supporters were arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police in a week-long operation across Delhi, Punjab and Haryana.The ISI and SFJ have been advocating secessionist and pro-Khalistan activities in India for long following which the ministry of home affairs in July last year banned the SFJ for advocating ‘Referendum 2020’, an online campaign for Khalistan, which seeks a separate homeland for Sikhs.Intelligence agencies have also shared inputs about another person named Pak-based Gopal Singh Chawla, a close aide of 26/11 Mumbai terror attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist Hafiz Saeed, for his role in pro-Khalistan activities in India.It has been suggested in the warning, which was shared earlier this month, to keep the national capital on high alert ahead of Independence Day. Inputs were shared that KLF group has been tasked by ISI and SFJ for terrorist activity in the national capital, said the source.As per the information, KLF group is in close proximity with Pakistani ISI handler Abdullah and Avtar Singh Pannu of the SFJ. The KLF group has been tasked to lure youths to the organisation and has been assigned to indoctrinate youths at the behest of their bosses based in Pakistan, the sources said.For funding, another source said, the ISI handlers asked the KLF to extort money from local businessmen to arrange locally made weapons and give momentum to the terror plan.The source further claimed that Abdullah asked them to recruit fresh youth for training in terror camps in Pakistan and promised to provide them weapons like AK-47 assault rifles and sophisticated pistols for their module.The KLF suspects arrested by the Delhi Police have also told police that they were asked by their handlers to get in touch with likeminded people for which they were asked to attend court hearings of arrested militants.The group was also tasked to take help of social media sites like Facebook to upload incriminating videos with posters, photos and songs supporting Khalistan leaders and the Khalistan movement.The information sends a clear message that ISI has opened two fronts -- militancy in Jammu & Kashmir and Khalistan group in Punjab-- to destabilise India. It all began in 2018 and 2019 when ISI allowed the Sikh separatist SFJ to open its office in Pakistan and also to display the ‘Referendum 2020’ posters during Baisakhi when a large number of Indian Sikh devotees had gathered in Pakistan to celebrate the festival.Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta last year had also coordinated with the central security agencies to tackle the threat triggered by ‘2020 Sikh Referendum’ clearly aimed at pushing the ISI agenda of dividing the Sikh community. The referendum is now learnt to have been postponed till 2022, however, the Khalistan movement is being backed on a regular basis, the source said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/intel-warns-of-isi-sfj-sponsored-pro-khalistan-activity-in-country/story-lPegM1GGfvFTsR8nUpi4JM.html
28-06-2020||Mumbai||Sharad Pawar’s statement unclear, he too was worried about Chinese intrusion: Congress||A day after Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief and former defence minister Sharad Pawar asked the Congress leader Rahul Gandhi ‘to not politicise’ the India-China border clashes, state Congress leaders tried to downplay the entire issue by terming Pawar’s statement as ‘unclear’. State Congress chief and state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, on Sunday, said that it is not clear what Pawar has said. “By using just one of his comments, the media should not draw any conclusions and rush to give a clean chit to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. We lost 20 soldiers in the Galwan valley face off. Yet, PM Modi said there was no intrusion by China. Taking advantage of this Chinese are calling our martyrs as intruders. I am sure that even Pawarsaheb is as saddened by this as we are this as are,” he said Pawar, on Saturday in Satara, had virtually chided Rahul Gandhi for attempting to politicise an issue concerning national security and reminded how China occupied 45,000 sq km of the Indian territory in 1962. “Let us not forget what happened in 1962 when China occupied 45,000 sq km of Indian territory. While levelling such allegations, one must also think what happened in the past,” he had said.Thorat said, “The Congress party is with the government on the China issue, but that doesn’t mean that questions shouldn’t be asked on the issues of national interest. The questions raised by Rahul Gandhiji on border security is not politics, but discharging of our responsibility given to us by the people. We cannot compare the 1962 situation with that with what is happening today.”Congress is a junior partner in Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi ruled state government with Shiv Sena and NCP.Throat said that PM Modi did not utter a single word regarding the Chinese aggression in his Man Ki Baat on Sunday even after the concerns raised by Gandhi over the country’s integrity. “It is not the time to keep quiet. The BJP should not consider the Congress suggestions as politics. If it is about the country’s integrity, Rahulji and the Congress will continue to ask questions,” he said.Meanwhile, Congress has raised questions over the funding to the PM Cares Fund by leading Chinese companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sharad-pawar-s-statement-unclear-he-too-was-worried-about-chinese-intrusion-congress/story-gJagcImUDIBuQNXmM24u1K.html
28-06-2020||City||No community spread of Covid-19 in Delhi: Amit Shah||NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday said there is no community transmission of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi, and added that he was confident the Capital would not see 550,000 cases of the disease by July 31, as predicted by the state’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia earlier this month.In an interview to ANI, the Union home minister, who has been monitoring the Covid-19 situation in the national capital, said Sisodia’s comments created “fear” among people, and gave the Centre the cue to step in and coordinate the city’s response to the virus which has infected 83,077 people and killed 2,623 here till Sunday.“Around the second week of June, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that by July 31, there will be 5.50 lakh persons infected with the virus. He that there will be no place left, no beds left and the situation will be difficult. This created a lot of fear in the minds of people in Delhi. His estimate was based on figures. I do not want to go into whether estimate was right or wrong. But a situation of fear arose and some people started mulling an exodus (out of Delhi),” Shah said.“The situation regarding bodies (of Covid-19 victims) in Delhi was grim. Over 350 bodies were pending for last rites. We decided that within two days last rites of bodies will be done as per religion. Today, no body is left for last rites. Now last rituals are conducted same day,” Shah said.The Centre stepped in to manage the virus situation in Delhi on June 14, with Shah holding at least four meetings with central and state agencies so far, and visiting hospitals to assess their preparedness. “…After Manish ji’s remarks, I felt that the central government should not stay idle. Modi ji has accountability towards the country. The PM also told me that the home ministry should take initiative to move forward and help the Delhi government,” he said.The home minister stressed that there is coordination between the Centre and state in tackling Covid-19 in Delhi. “There is coordination...(Delhi CM) Arvind Kejriwal is always kept in the loop. Decisions are taken by involving him also,” he said.Reacting to the home minister’s interview, Sisodia in a statement on Sunday said, “Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal sought help and support of every agency to battle (the) corona (virus disease) in Delhi. We got tremendous support from the central government, religious organisations like Radha Soami Satsang, Akshardham Temple Trust, Terapanthi, various hotels, banquets halls, private hospitals and NGOs like Doctors for U, and others.” He added: “ For increasing testing, we sought central government’s assistance, and they helped us with procuring rapid testing kits. Since then, testing has been increased by four times. The Centre also provided us with oxygen cylinders, ITBP [Indo-Tibetan Border Police] doctors and nurses for Radha Soami Covid centre and guidance from domain experts. “The deputy CM himself hoped that the estimate of 5.5 lakh cases by the end of July would prove wrong and pointed out that the recovery rate in Delhi is now 62%. “We are hopeful that situation will improve in the coming weeks and will certainly not be as bleak as it looked in first week of June when domain experts predicted 5.5 lakh cases in Delhi by July 31.” Shah said a series of steps have been taken to stem the spread of the virus and ramp up medical facilities.“…I can say now with confidence that situation of 5.5 lakh cases will not come on July 31,” Shah said. He added that the situation would be in control by July 31 because the government has focussed on taking preventive steps, including more tests and contact tracing.“The evidence for or against community transmission in Delhi will come from the sero survey that has started in the city, and will be completed in next two weeks or so. It will be too premature to say anything before the results of the survey are out,” says Dr Sanjay K Rai, professor, centre for community medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.Shah also referred to the Delhi government’s decision to reserve hospitals, except those run by the Centre, for residents of Delhi — which was overturned by Lieutenant Governor Baijal — and said it was untenable.“I am also from outside Delhi. Where will I go, if something happens to me? Delhi is the capital of the country. And people from different states stay here, come and go,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-community-spread-of-covid-19-in-delhi-amit-shah/story-WzefX0iDe0CYpzX8RyONiO.html

28-06-2020||Chandigarh||FIR against govt official for not furnishing information under RTI||An FIR was lodged on Saturday against an unidentified ‘public servant’ in Ambala who failed to furnish documents sought by a Right to Information (RTI) applicant from the sub-divisional magistrate’s (SDM) office, saying these “were missing” or were “very old.”Applicant Neeraj Sharma of Ambala had on May 3, 2018, moved an RTI application asking for a copy of records from the city SDM’s office but didn’t get a response from the SDM-cum-SPIO (state public information officer). Later Sharma moved to FAA (first appellate authority)-cum-DC on June 25, 2018, which was decided in a month on July 23, 2018, the FIR states.Aggrieved with the decision, however, Sharma filed a second appeal before the Haryana state information commission, Chandigarh, on August 28, 2020, after which notices were issued to the parties. The SPIO informed the commission that the record in question had been “missing” and the other one was “very old.” After perusal of the case files the commission observed that the first appeal of the appellant was decided by the FAA with directions to the SPIO to provide the information within a week. The commission was also of the view that records of the years 2009 to 2011 had been sought, which were “not old”, so either the SPIO was concealing information or did not want to hand over the records to the applicant, the FIR states.The FIR was registered at the Ambala city police station under section 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant) of the IPC on the complaint of city SDM Subhash Sihag on Saturday. Sihag is currently SDM of Ambala Cantonment. Commenting on the matter, station in-charge Ram Kumar said, “In 2019, the DC received intimation from the information commissioner that an FIR should be registered against the officer who had lost the record. After this, we asked the SDM concerned to fix responsibility, but in his reply he said it was difficult to check who was on duty in that year as his offices have changed and many have been transferred. So, we’ve registered an FIR and will check the old office records to find out who was in charge back then.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fir-against-govt-official-for-not-furnishing-information-under-rti/story-QanLAEn0Lcwkdqx4L599QO.html

28-06-2020||City||Immigration fraud: 38 travel agents landed in Haryana Police net this month||The special investigation team (SIT) formed to probe the immigration frauds has arrested 38 travel agents and registered 201 first information reports (FIRs) since June 2. Inspector general of police (Karnal Range) Bharti Arora, who is heading the investigation team, said, “As of now, 211 travel agents have been booked under the Emigration Act and 38 have been arrested from different districts.”“The police have also recovered Rs 5 lakh from some of these agents and more arrests are likely in the days to come. The number of FIRs is going up day by day as more people are coming forward to file their complaints,” the IG added. According to Arora, youths from Karnal, Ambala, Kurukshetra and Kaithal districts were “soft targets” for these agents. Maximum FIRs were registered in these districts — 52 in Karnal, 40 in Kaithal and 35 in Kurukshetra. The IG said that SIT was also investigating 270 FIRs registered in the state in the past two years against travel agents. PRE-ARREST BAILS HAMPERING PROGRESSThe police are facing problems in arresting such agents as many of them have already secured anticipatory bails.As per police officials, action against such travel agents has helped many youths in mustering courage to file a complaint.Kurukshetra superintendent of police Astha Modi said, “Maximum complaints have poured in from the districts near the Punjab border. Many victims from these areas sold their assets to go abroad, even illegally.”“Now, they are left with nothing,” she added. The police have even decided against taking any action against the youths duped by travel agents even as they also violated the international immigration laws by choosing illegal ways to chase their dollar dreams. They ended up coughing up Rs 15 lakh to Rs 30 lakh to reach the US. It is worth mentioning here that on June 2, Haryana home minister Anil Vij had constituted a seven-member SIT to investigate cases of ‘kabootarbazi’ (human trafficking) and immigration frauds in the state days after the US deported 76 people of Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/immigration-fraud-38-travel-agents-landed-in-haryana-police-net-this-month/story-Xmz9R9f3lM7DaAX50SgbFJ.html
28-06-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand forest department develops India’s first lichen park in Kumaon||Indicator of pollution levels in the Himalayas, Uttarakhand forest department has claimed to have developed country’s first lichen park in Kumaon’s Munsiyari area, spread over 1.5 acres with over 80 species of lichens collected from across the Himalayan state. Considered most significant bio-indicator of ecosystem fluctuations as they are more sensitive towards habitat and climate changes, lichen species are facing many threats and continue to decline from some areas of Himalayan regions because of overexploitation of natural resources, mounting pressures of urbanization, habitat-destruction, deforestation and increasing pollution, according to forest officials.Sanjiv Chaturvedi, Conservator of Forests (Research Wing) Uttarakhand said, lichens found in the Himalayas up to 5000 metres, are important species as they are the best bioindicators of the pollution levels.“Lichen need pure air to grow. If pollution levels increase in a certain area, the lichen species decline there. So it serves as a natural indicator of pollution levels in an area. And they are important to study in the Himalayas, given various threats to Himalayan environment and ecology”In July last year, HT had reported that state forest department had approved research project for studying lichens in the Himalayan state. The project aims to study the distribution of different lichen species, their habitat, their morphological and physiological aspects, surveying and literature review, the establishment of species, current threats to their habitat including anthropological and climatic factors, and coming up with suitable conservation strategies and protection strategies.Chaturvedi said these Jurassic-era lichen species are used in food, perfumes, dyes and traditional medicines.“Our aim of developing this Lichen Park is to create awareness among people here about their importance in the overall Himalayan ecology and how to link livelihood of these locals with these species and check their incriminate exploitation. One of the lichen species called Jhula Ghas is used as a flavouring agent in Hyderabadi biryani and some non-vegetarian dishes in North Indian cuisine. Their potential for antibiotics and sunscreen chemicals is also being explored by researchers. Some species can also withstand high levels of radiation and can be used as biological sensors that give us information about the environment”, said Chaturvedi.“We chose Munsiyari area for the park as it has a rich diversity of lichen species. Over 120 lichen species are found in this area. So it was easy for us to develop the park here”, he saidAccording to experts, Uttarakhand has more than 600 species of lichens followed by Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir with 503 and 386 species respectively. In Uttarakhand lichens are found in Chamoli, Champawat, Pithoragarh, Nainital, Dehradun region. Some lichen species found in the state include Parmotrema pertatum, Usnea lognissima, Lecanora subfuseescens, Sarcogyne privigna, Arthonia impolitella, Acarospora fusca, Acarospora oxytona, Polysporina dubia and so on.What is a lichen? A lichen is a composite organism that arises from algae or cyanobacteria living among filaments of multiple fungi species in a mutualistic relationship. They come in many colours, sizes and forms. The properties are sometimes plant-like but lichens are not plants. Lichens may have tiny, leafless branches, flat leaf-like structures.They are one of the oldest living things, grow in a wide range of habitat including some of the most extreme conditions like the arctic, tundra, hot dry desert rocky coasts, toxic heaps, roofs bare rocks, walls, exposed soil surfaces are some of the places where it can be easily found.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-forest-department-develops-india-s-first-lichen-park-in-kumaon/story-tBJYbxiexPVTlxhjU6y1hO.html
28-06-2020||Gurugram||Online classes for kids, a task for parents||Every Monday to Friday, Aaryav Shukla, a four-year-old nursery student, logs in to a digital classroom sharp at noon. The classes are 60 minutes long and divided into two sessions with a 15-minute break in between. Around two teachers and six students appear in different grids of the laptop screen with parents making guest appearances and running in and out of the screen, often to catch hold and bring back one or more of their kids who decide to wander off.Aaryav’s mother, Sonu Singh, sits by his side throughout the class, coaxing the four-year-old to focus on the lessons and activities. “He often refuses to sit patiently and is constantly moving around in the house during the class. Half my time goes in ensuring that he sits and focuses on the class. It’s bedlam with teachers calling out the names of students and parents shouting ‘come back, sit here’ all at the same time. It’s the parents who are actually sitting and attending the classes,” said Singh.Aaryav is one of the scores of children who are adjusting to the new trend of online classes that have become a panacea of sorts in recent times. With the raging Covid-19 pandemic throwing up unprecedented challenges and leading to the physical closure of schools, online classes for children — starting from pre-school to senior school — have become the new vehicles for imparting lessons. As uncertainty prevails over the resumption of physical classes, these classes have invited both revulsion and reverence, with parents remaining a divided lot.Online live classes, for children in younger grades especially, have become a bone of contention throughout the country. So far two states—Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh— have banned live classes for students up till class 5. Maharashtra has discontinued online classes for children up till class 2. In other states,such as Telangana, parents and rights groups have also sought a ban on classes for younger children. Educationists say that online classes for toddlers were akin to children interacting with strangers, since most children were not familiar with teachers and peers. In such a scenario, pushing children into online classes could be an uneasy experience for them, say experts. While parents said that it was not easy sitting around with younger children for these classes and there was very little value addition, they agreed still that online classes brought some semblance of routine for the child.“I feel it is a bit too much for his age, but at the same time, he stays engaged at least for some part of the day. Learning takes place, albeit slowly,” said Singh. With wavering attention spans, ensuring that children were looped in during the class was a key challenge, added other parents.Umang Singla, a parent of a nursery student who started school this year, said that while online classes were not a 100% substitute for the routine ones, learning had to continue in some way during the current circumstances. “Children who started school this year have never met their teachers or classmates in a physical classroom space. Their first meeting took place online. The experience has been challenging, but everyone is trying to adapt to the situation gradually,” said Singla.He said that one of the key challenges during these classes were for parents, who are required to be around children all throughout. “The sessions initially took place for a shorter duration between one to two hours and have gradually increased to two hours or more. For working parents, juggling classes can be difficult,” added Singla.Ashu Panwar, another parent, whose four-year-old daughter Zara is in kindergarten, agreed that getting children to sit for online classes was a task in itself. For parents, the maximum effort went into ensuring that the child was focusing on the classes. “My daughter’s attention span is very low. After every ten minutes, she wants to stand up and tries to run away. I keep changing her place to ensure that she doesn’t doze off and stays alert. Even the extent to which children grasp what’s being taught has reduced since their attention span is wavering,” said Panwar, who is often compelled to use hacks to ensure that her daughter pays attention to the class. “Sometimes, I have to bribe Zara to sit through the class. I tell her that I’ll do something for her in return if she sits quietly,” she added.A digital marketing professional, Panwar has been working from home along with her husband. Managing professional work, household chores along with online classes was not easy, said Panwar. Classes take place from 9am to 11am and sometimes, for longer. During these hours, Panwar is unable to take any calls or focus on any other work. “Virtual classes don’t feel like classes but as they say, something is better than nothing. The pandemic is not going away soon and some semblance of learning has to take place since parents are not always equipped to teach,” she said.Most parents with younger kids said that online classes required a lot of effort and seemed to be directed more at parents than students. For most of them, the routine offered by these classes was more of a motivation than the nature of learning that took place during the classes. School administrators, however, said that online classes have ensured real-time interactivity for a student, which was crucial in the current circumstances. “It is important for students to be engaged in a constructive manner especially at a time when we are all being encouraged to not have any contact with the outside world. It helps their mental growth and happiness,” said Kunal Bhadoo, director of Kunskapsskolan Schools.Bhadoo said that the school had not received any complaints from parents pertaining to online classes, so far. He added that learning during online classes was parent-led, which was a crucial intervention, especially for younger children. “Parents are doing the hand-holding during online classes. Learning flows from the teacher to the parent and the parent to the child. It is needed since children need support at home,” said Bhadoo.Educationist Gowri Ishwaran said that schools could administer activity-based assignments and worksheets for children in nursery and younger classes over online classes. She said that most children starting school this year were unfamiliar with teachers and peers due to which cementing a relationship solely through online interaction will be difficult.“Children who started schooling this year and are attending online nursery classes are essentially interacting with strangers. They didn’t get the chance to know their teachers in person due to the unprecedented circumstances created by this Covid-19 pandemic. Relating to a complete stranger online doesn’t come naturally for a 3 or 4-year-old. I don’t think incoming nursery students this year need regular digital exposure,” said Ishwaran.She suggested that schools could share resources with parents for keeping children engaged, “Children know their parents and can learn comfortably from them. Parents don’t need to be paranoid about the content of classes or the syllabus in such times.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/online-classes-for-kids-a-task-for-parents/story-SHH862S7YLEjVJybg0BRpJ.html
28-06-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER to be validation centre for rapid Covid-19 diagnostic tests||The Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research is setting up a committee to validate a point of care (POC) rapid diagnostic test to detect the presence of viral proteins (antigens) expressed by the Covid-19 virus from samples from respiratory tracts, it has been learnt.These antigen detection tests will be quick, accurate, cover a large chunk of the population, and be done POC or where the patient is being cared for.The institute was chosen as a validation centre as part of an Indian Council of Medical and Research (ICMR) programme for clinical trials for such tests for Covid-19 cases. The need for the reliable and convenient test was felt as the popular reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnostic test for Covid-19 is not widely available. It has the potential to be used in all possible public and private healthcare settings and made available for mass testing.Dr Jagat Ram, director PGIMER, said it had been decided after a round of meetings that samples of the same suspected persons will be conducted through RT-PCR as well as the antigen kits.“The results will be later collated for the authenticity of the kits which we will shortly receive. According to ICMR conditions a minimum of 300 rapid antigen tests will be required for each validation and the results will be communicated to ICMR,” he added.On execution plans, he said, “A committee will be constituted to work out the modalities and comprehensive plan along with timelines to meet the desired expectations of ICMR and contribute towards containing the pandemic.”“The availability of antigen-based detection tests is very limited all across the world. Most of such tests have relatively moderate sensitivity but high specificity. The test is a promising tool to keep a track of Covid-19 patients by rapid testing,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-to-be-validation-centre-for-rapid-covid-19-diagnostic-tests/story-mJnQfiPMge2i4WFSyCssKI.html
28-06-2020||Gurugram||Colleges asked to focus on students’ mental health, provide support||College teachers will collaborate with the health department, which has recently launched a mental health tele-counselling service number 1075 to help address mental health concerns during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. As part of the collaboration, college teachers will be trained to further expand the scope of the helpline and ensure that students avail the service. Colleges are also exploring the possibility of including conversations around mental health as part of lesson plans.To address the concerns of students and guide colleges in chalking out the modalities of mental health support, a team of doctors conducted a webinar for college principals on Saturday. They discussed various issues pertaining to rising mental stress and anxiety during the pandemic and coping mechanisms. Pooja Khullar, the principal of Dronacharya Government College, said that mental health concerns due to the spread of the pandemic were afflicting students as well.“Students are slipping into depression and anxiety due to various reasons. They are confined to their houses and struggling with uncertainties. Some of them are also facing parental pressure at home. Recent incidents of celebrity deaths have also generated a conversation around mental health concerns, which necessitates that students are made aware of the various options where they can avail support,” Khullar said.She said that doctors had advised teachers to play a proactive role and ensure that students can share their concerns in appropriate forums. “We are considering the possibility of approaching the university and introducing changes in the curriculum. We can design the curriculum in such a way that every week, we have one or two sessions dedicated to discussing mental health,” Khullar said.She said that the department was working on the modalities, but for now, the health department would be sharing necessary resources on dealing with mental health issues, which would be circulated among the student community.Satyamanyu Yadav, the principal of Government College in Sector 9, said that teachers had been asked to popularise the state mental health helpline number among students and motivate them to avail help from experts if needed. Based on requirements, the department was also willing to hold separate webinars for college students, Yadav said.“With no end to the pandemic in sight, students are worried about their future. Such concerns can be dealt with better communication and help from experts. Doctors from the health department said that they’d be training teachers so that they can communicate better and reach out to students,” Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/colleges-asked-to-focus-on-students-mental-health-provide-support/story-IOh2i0MC4fst3ZoaQYY9AP.html
28-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Work stopped at Sirhaul underpass after GMDA, pvt developers fail to pay their share||In a major setback to the Sirhaul underpass and flyover project, coming up on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has decided to stop work after they failed to get funds from the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and two private stakeholders. The NHAI said that almost 75% of the work has been completed on the Rs 162 crore project but the contractor has been compelled to stop work as they were unable to get funds from GMDA, DLF and Ambience Developers.Going by the memorandum of understanding (MoU), the GMDA has to bear 50% of the cost of the u-turn underpass at the Sirhaul toll plaza while Ambience Developers and DLF were to pay 25% of the cost each. Likewise, the GMDA was supposed to pay 25% of the cost of the Shankar Chowk flyover, while NHAI would bear the rest.Ashok Sharma, project director, NHAI said they have written to the stakeholders time and again since June 2019 asking them to make payments but nothing has happened. “We have spent more than our share of the funds but have not received funds from the other stakeholders. Work has been stopped as it violates the MoU. The NHAI can’t spend beyond what has been stipulated in the agreement or beyond its mandate,” he said.The u-turn underpass, opposite Ambience Mall, will help commuters turn towards Iffco Chowk on the expressway without going all the way to Rajokri in Delhi. The flyover at Shankar Chowk would allow traffic coming from Cyber Hub to take a seamless turn towards Delhi and Udyog Vihar with ease. Both are part of the same project.The halting of work at this stage could also delay the projects and it could miss its deadline of September 4. “If funds are paid up in the next week or so, we are confident of completing the underpass and the flyover in time, otherwise it will be delayed,” said a representative of the contractor, not authorised to speak to the media.According to details shared by the NHAI, the GMDA has to pay Rs 14.74 crore as its share of the total cost of the flyover. Ambience Developers and DLF, meanwhile, have to pay Rs 25.737 crore each, which is 25% each of the total cost of the project.Till date, the NHAI has spent Rs 70 crore on this project, said Sharma.When asked about the matter, a DLF spokesperson said it was committed to paying its share for the project. “We have always supported authorities in completing our commitments. We are committed to paying our share. We have always worked for improvement of the infrastructure in the city and the 16 lanes Raghvendra Marg expressway is a testament to it,” he added.A representative of Ambience Developers said that the matter had been delayed due to the pandemic in the last three-four months. “The matter is under consideration of the headquarters but due to closure of offices since March, the issue could not be finalised,” said Vijay Aima, vice president, Ambience Developers.KC Sharma, General Manager (technical)-cum-project coordinator, GMDA, did not respond despite repeated phone calls and messages.Gurgaon MLA Sudhir Singla, meanwhile, said that this infrastructure project was crucial for the city and he will take up the issue of funds with higher authorities. “This matter has come to my notice only now. I will take up this issue with GMDA officials and also the state government in Chandigarh. This project should not get delayed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-work-stopped-at-sirhaul-underpass-after-gmda-pvt-developers-fail-to-pay-their-share/story-AMENxQlIzOYpKTKDG2pxMJ.html
28-06-2020||Gurugram||Haryana Police brings down passport verification time from 21 days to five days||The passport verification process of the Haryana Police that earlier used to take 21 days has been brought down to five days across the state, said police officials. The state is trying hard to cut it down to three days. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Haryana Police has also taken an initiative to improve the system further by launching an m-passport police application for speedy submission of requests for verification. The application allows field-level verification officers to directly upload the verification report on the system digitally.Commenting on the matter, Anil Rao, the additional director general of police, CID, said that earlier, it used to take a total of 71 days to issue an Indian passport. This was nearly three times than the recommended period of 24 days fixed by the government. The police took twice as long as they should — 42 instead of 21 days — to verify applicants’ information. “The average time taken earlier was more than 21 days. The situation has now significantly improved,” Rao said.There are two regional passport offices in the region — one in Delhi and the other in Chandigarh — that cater to the residents of Haryana. While Gurugram, Faridabad, Palwal, Nuh, Narnaul, Rewari, Jhajjar, Rohtak, Sonepat and Charkhi Dadri are covered by the Delhi office, the Chandigarh office covers areas such as Panchkula, Ambala, Yamunanagar, Kurukshetra, Hisar, Hansi, Kaithal, Bhiwani, Sirsa, Jind, Fatehabad, Karnal and Panipat, said the police. The passport applications received in Delhi and Chandigarh are sent online to their respective districts for verification. The security branch of the district concerned then downloads them and sends a hard copy to the police station concerned, along with a copy to CID headquarters.Rao said that a CID verification is mainly conducted to determine if the applicant’s name exists on any surveillance list, lists of hardcore terrorists, harbourers, history sheeters, etc. The Online Passport Sewa project was implemented in Haryana in May 2010. Since CID acts as a nodal agency in conducting verification of applications, strenuous efforts were made by officers of the Haryana Police and the CID to do away with the delay. The Government of India has fixed 21 days for police verification for which ₹150 per application is reimbursed to the respective state. “If verification is sent before 21 days, then ₹150 per application is reimbursed. “ We have brought down the average time taken in verification of passport application to five days. Despite a heavy rush of applications, we are trying our best to cut down on the verification time,” said Rao, adding that this would be brought down to three days. Due its impressive performance, the state was adjudged as one of the three best states in India by the ministry of external affairs on Passport Seva Dewas last year. The state has received nearly ₹20 crore last year and is expecting to receive ₹25 crore, said Rao. Last week, Haryana Police bagged the third rank in speedy passport verification across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-police-brings-down-passport-verification-time-from-21-days-to-five-days/story-6DjEWvebbCYeIaDbPdFvAK.html
28-06-2020||Gurugram||Brick kiln owner’s murder: Owner of car used in the crime arrested||Two days after a 42-year-old brick kiln owner was shot dead allegedly by two armed men in Sohna, the owner of the car used by the two suspects for the murder was arrested on Sunday, the police said. Both the murder suspects had been identified, the police said, adding that the motive behind the alleged murder was “revenge”.On Friday at 10.40 am, Virendra Dayma, a resident of Chungi number 1 in Sohna, was sitting on a chair outside when a white Alto car had stopped near the gate of his house. Two armed men had alighted from the car and fired several gunshots at him. He had suffered eight gunshot wounds and had succumbed to the injuries on the spot. His brother, Narendra, has said that he was in an adjacent room and had seen the suspects flee in the car.The police arrested one Amit Dagar, 30, from Alipur in Bhondsi on Sunday. Dagar is the owner of the Alto car, in which the two suspects had escaped after the murder.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said, “Our probe found that Dagar got a WhatsApp call from his friend Sonu Rathi, who asked him to give his car to Rathi’s brother-in-law, Dharmender—who is the prime suspect in the case. Dharmender along with an aide planned the murder and had shot Dayma.” The police said after the shooting, the two suspects had driven to Alipur to return the car to Dagar and asked him to hide it. The car is yet to be recovered, and Dharmender and his accomplice still remain at large.ACP said Dharmender’s father was allegedly murdered at least 15 years ago and the victim’s brother Narendra was arrested and later convicted in the case. “He had been serving time and was recently released on parole during the lockdown. So prima facie, it appears that Dharmender planned to murder Narendra’s brother to avenge his father’s death. Several crime teams are trying to trace the suspects,” the ACP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/brick-kiln-owner-s-murder-owner-of-car-used-in-the-crime-arrested/story-Kd8GzXtjFh7XqaFTfciUOK.html
28-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram, Faridabad malls to reopen from July 1; social distancing, sanitisation focal points||Malls in Gurugram and Faridabad districts are all set to reopen from July 1 onwards — after a three month hiatus —a set of Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), released by the Haryana government on Sunday, stated.On Friday, during a press conference at Civil Lines, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh had said that malls will reopen in Gurugram next week. However, the exact date of reopening had not been disclosed. The MCG commissioner had also said that an official order in this regard was expected to be issued by the Haryana government soon.“The SOP will serve as a guideline of lists and rules mall owners need to comply with when they reopen their respective establishments. The mandatory points mentioned in the SOP need to be strictly enforced and followed. Any violation of this may result in penalties or requisite actions being taken against mall owners or management as per law,” said Singh.As per the SOP issued by the directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB), malls can open between 9am and 8pm, but cinema halls, gaming arcades and play areas for children will continue to remain closed. Social distancing and wearing of masks need to be strictly followed by visitors and all mall workers at all times. Visitors also need to install the Aarogya Setu app. Visitors above the age of 65 and below the age of 10 will not be permitted to visit shopping malls,” the SOP states.Mall authorities will have to ensure that every visitor is scanned for temperature via thermal scanners as well as to ensure that hand-sanitizers are placed at all entry points. The mall authorities have also been directed to prevent large gatherings or congregations and to ensure that all mall employees who are at high risk, such as senior citizens, pregnant women, and those who have underlying medical conditions, are “preferably” not placed in any front-line work requiring direct interaction with public.Temperature setting of all air-conditioners should be between 24-30 degrees Celsius, the rules further stated.The SOP also says that use of escalators can be permitted if visitors travel on alternate steps. Valet parking can be operational provided the staff is wearing masks, and gloves, and steering wheels, door handles, car keys are properly disinfected. The SOP also lays out guidelines to be followed if someone tests positive, directing that after placing the person in a “room or area” where they can remain isolated, they must be provided with a mask and the owners must immediately inform the closest hospital or clinic, or else “call the state or district helpline”.“A risk assessment will be undertaken by the designated public health authority...and accordingly further action be initiated regarding management of the case, his/her contacts and need for disinfection,” the new rules say. The premises must be immediately disinfected if a person tests positive.Regarding shopkeepers and vendors, the SOP states that, apart from ensuring social distancing norms and “preventive measures”, they must ensure “staggering of visitors...to ensure not more than 50% seating capacity at any particular time”. The latter is also applicable for food courts where staff and waiters also have to wear masks and hand gloves. In food courts, the SOP states, seating arrangements must be made while ensuring social distancing, and “contactless mode of ordering and digital modes of payment” encouraged.The municipalities have been directed to “monitor compliance” of the directions “by undertaking regular visits”, and to check that proper sanitization is done. They have also been given the power to issue challans of Rs 500 to visitors “not wearing/using face masks”, and handing five masks to them.“If any violation of the guidelines issued by ministry of health & family welfare, Government of India, is noticed, challans shall be issued against each violation... violations shall be punishable under the provisions of Disaster Management Act, 2005 as well as under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860,” the order states.Shobha Sengupta, president of South Point Condominium Association, which overlooks all maintenance and day-to-day functions at South Point Mall on Golf Course Road, said that the SOP will be vital for the association to start preparations for reopening as it provides a checklist on all the requisite safety measures and precautions that need to be undertaken.“Following the issuance of the SOP, we have already started disinfecting and sanitising operations to ensure that the mall reopens in the safest possible manner. All the shops have been out of business for more than three months. Hence, we have also simultaneously started procuring all requisite protective gears for our staff and other necessary equipment to ensure shop owners do not lose out on any day of business, and operations can commence from July 1 itself,” said Sengupta.Barring Gurugram and Faridabad district, where cases of coronavirus are the highest in Haryana, the directorate of urban local bodies (ULB) had issued an SOP for malls in all other districts of the state on June 7.“Although we welcome the reopening of malls, we’ll not be opening our establishment right away. We’ll be monitoring the footfall at the mall for one week and then take a call accordingly. We don’t want to be in a situation where our running costs exceed the total earnings,” said Vikram Rana, owner of Vapour Bar Exchange, located at Global Foyer Mall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-faridabad-malls-to-reopen-from-july-1-social-distancing-sanitisation-focal-points/story-KzvWBr1ZSZPDKo7kjPxFHO.html
28-06-2020||City||Noida may see light rains today||Noida: The city may see light rain on Monday evening, the India Meteorological Department said on Sunday.Even as the monsoon has covered the entire region of western UP, Noida and neighbouring cities are yet to see proper rainfall. “Monday may see light rains towards the evening hours. The maximum temperature is likely to hover around 40 degrees Celsius,” said an IMD official.According to weather experts, though the monsoon has arrived, the region is expected to see rains only after July 3 due to certain unfavourable weather activities. The experts said that the current line of trough (low pressure line) which passes through Punjab to West Bengal via southern Haryana keeps oscillating from north to south.“There is a trough line on the north of Delhi leading to westerly winds. It may change and shift a little by tomorrow evening that will be favourable for the light rains towards the evening,” said Mahesh Palawat, director of Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency.He said that with current trough line towards norther region, a large part of Delhi-NCR and western Uttar Pradesh would remain largely dry and thus, despite the arrival of monsoon, will only see light and patchy rains like pre-monsoon showers.“Good rainfall is expected in the region between July 3 and 5. Till then, there will only be drizzling or patchy rains. The maximum temperatures will also hover around 40 degrees Celsius,” said Palawat.The IMD had earlier announced the early arrival of monsoon due to the favourable weather conditions.On Sunday, the maximum temperature in Noida was recorded at 40.2 degrees Celsius, three notches above the season’s average, and against 39 degrees a day earlier, the IMD said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-may-see-light-rains-today/story-sFF2dv9ArUiP5EJwyGfGvL.html
28-06-2020||City||Ghaziabad: 200-metre ramp connecting Hindon elevated road with Delhi-Meerut e-way opened||Ghaziabad: Commute for thousands of vehicles will now become easier as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has opened up a 200-metre ramp providing direct access to the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME) from the Hindon elevated road in Ghaziabad.Till now, motorists coming from the Hindon elevated road had to descend near UP-Gate and travel about 150 metres on the wrong side to climb on to the UP-Gate flyover and reach Phase 1 of the DME. Last year, the vice chairperson of the Ghaziabad development authority (GDA) had held meetings with the NHAI following which a ramp was proposed to be constructed to ease commuting.“The ramp is about 200 metres and we have opened it. Now, commuters coming from the Hindon elevated road can descend at UP-Gate and go directly to the DME’s phase 1 without needing to take the wrong turn. But this facility is two-laned and is for the use of two-wheelers and cars only. We will not allow any heavy vehicles as it has a high ascend,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI.The six-lane Hindon elevated road connects Ghaziabad’s Raj Nagar Extension to UP-Gate via a stretch of 10.3km, intended to provide direct connectivity to the DME.The GDA has restricted speed limit over the Hindon elevated road to 80kmph, against the design speed of 100kmph, and has also disallowed entry of heavy traffic vehicles. It is largely used by commuters as a bypass road to east Delhi.The Phase 1 of the DME spans Akshardham in Delhi to UP-Gate border while phase 2 stretches from UP-Gate to Dasna over 19.2km. The phase 3, Dasna to Meerut over a stretch of 32km, is under construction. It was scheduled to open in May but got delayed due to the national lockdown.The phase 4 of the project, from Dasna to Hapur, is already operational.“The work progress for phase 2 is about 79% and for phase 4 it is about 72%. Although we have missed the deadline due to the lockdown and scarcity of labour, we are targeting to finish the two phases in December. We have about 47 underpasses proposed for phase 4 and four more have been proposed for the benefit of nearby villagers to connect to the Eastern Peripheral Expressway,” Garg added.Phase 2, overall, has 17 underpasses proposed for commuters.“At present, the physical work progress of phase 2 and 4 is slow due to scarcity of labour. Further, we have monsoon season approaching which will further slow down work.

28-06-2020||City||Ghaziabad to start week-long antigen test drive from July 1||Ghaziabad Amid the rising number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the district, the health department has decided to launch a week-long rapid antigen testing drive from July 1, wherein about 500 tests will be conducted daily, officials said.According to the officials, they have been able to conduct about 250 tests per day during the ongoing antigen testing which started on Friday. Till Sunday, a total of 716 tests through of regular antigen testing were done, of which 64 came out positive. The officials said that 37 of the 64 positive results came during testing on Sunday alone, in areas such as Indirpauram and Vaishali, among others. “At present, our average antigen testing is about 250 per day and we will scale it mandatorily to 500 tests per day during the week-long drive. During the drive, we will focus on areas of Indirpauram, Vaishali, Vasundhara and Kaushambi, among others, as they have a high number of cases. We are working on composition of teams that will include lab technicians. Such teams will be deployed at convenient locations near several containment zones. Currently, we have only about 25 lab technicians with us who are also involved in sampling for RT-PCR tests,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.Recently, 8,000 antigen test kits were provided by the state government to ramp up testing in containment zones.“Once the result of an antigen test comes out positive, it is counted as ‘true’ positive. But for the rest, we again take samples and send them for RT-PCR tests to confirm ‘true’ negative. The antigen testing will be separate from our regular RT-PCR sampling, which is about 450 per day at present,” Gupta said.Till June 28, Ghaziabad had a total of 1393 cases (60 fresh), cases, which included 50 deaths so far and 715 active cases. In past 24 hours, 25 patients were discharged.According to government records, the district could take only 149 samples for Covid-19 test in March, 2,729 in April, 7,106 in May and about 8,500 in June, so far. These figures bring the total number of samples collected so far to 18,500, which is not even 1% of the estimated 42 lakh population of the district.The UP government on Saturday had announced one-week-long special door-to-door surveillance activities in order to identify the suspected cases and people having comorbidities.According to state officials, the antigen testing drive will start from the Meerut division which includes six districts, which has been provided with a total of 30,000 antigen test kits. Health teams will be scanning for cases of influenza like illness (ILI) in containment zones while cases of and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) will be taken up in non-containment zones, they said.“In all areas, we will trace people having comorbid conditions, and will also be doing risk profiling of aged persons. Our teams will also be alerting them about safety and precautions to be taken up,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health).Residents seek nod for home isolation Meanwhile, several residents in the district have claimed that people are not coming forward for tests as Uttar Pradesh is yet to give nod for home isolation of Covid-19 positive patients.“There was a positive case in my office and it was essential for me to go for a Covid-19 test. But I decided against it as the state has no norm for home isolation of positive patients, and I didn’t want to land in a government hospital. In places like Delhi, home isolation is allowed,” said a resident of Ahimsa Khand in Indirapuram, who is an engineer with a company in Noida, asking not to be named.“Not everyone can afford the bills of private health care facilities. So, many people are not willing to take up Covid-19 tests in Ghaziabad,” he added.In a recent instance, a couple who tested positive for Covid-19 in Shakti Khand, Indirapuram, left for their other house in Delhi as they did not wish to go to a government hospital in Ghaziabad. “The couple has a six-month-old baby. So, they locked their Indirapuram home and stayed in home isolation at their other house in Delhi,” said Indirapuram resident Kuldeep Saxena, who knows about the couple.Alok Kumar, founder member of the federation of apartment owners’ associations in Ghaziabad, said he has written to the UP health department and Ghaziabad officials to allow home isolation.“We have given them a proposal. If they allow home isolation of asymptomatic positive patients, many societies in the city are willing to come up with in-house isolation facility. We will also arrange equipment like infrared thermometers, pulse oxymeters, etc. This will be beneficial for residents and will also lessen burden on health care facilities. Besides, home isolation is allowed as per guidelines of Ministry of Home Affairs,” Kumar added.Health officials said they also agree that the burden on health care infrastructure will lessen in case home isolation is allowed. “We have received a number of requests to allow home isolation facilities at high-rises. Since it is a policy decision, it cannot be taken up at the local level,” CMO Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-to-start-week-long-antigen-test-drive-from-july-1/story-2nsdvSn4SrFqg1QcmUQc9L.html

With these entities, highway commuters will be able to plan a designated halt and access all services in one place.Officials say that this will not only boost the local economy but also lessen the chances of any mishap owing to unauthorised constructions.District town planner Amit Madhoulia said that the plan, which is currently in the draft phase, will provide these services in a phased manner to the tourists coming to Yamunanagar or crossing the district on their way to Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand or Uttar Pradesh. “Pilgrims from across the country travel to Haridwar and most of them cross Yamunanagar on the way and we’ve some religious places in the district too. The district is a big industrial hub and connects Haryana with three neighbouring states. The hub will provide all services on 10 acres of land in an organised manner which will also reduce the risk of accidents caused due to many wayside entities currently functioning in an unorganised manner,” Amit said. “Kalanaur area, Chhachhrauli road and Fatehpuri village are the major entry points where we are planning to set up these centres. The plan has been approved by the state government and will soon be submitted to the competent authority who will decide the budget and other formalities,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/integrated-amenities-hubs-to-come-up-for-travellers-on-y-nagar-highways/story-hNuiLsnGIJnZ93nZMlZ0YN.html

Sister of active terrorist Abbas Sheikh and mother of deceased militant Tausif Ahmad Sheikh, Naseema Banoo was arrested on June 20 in a criminal case, besides her recent involvement in recruiting youth into terrorist ranks,” said Kashmir inspector general of police (IGP) Vijay Kumar.Bano’s militant son was killed along with four other Hizbul Mujahideen militants including a Kashmir University (KU) assistant professor, in an encounter with security forces in May 2018.The police sources said Bano’s brother is considered one of the longest serving militants of Kashmir.Police said Bano of Rampora Qaimoh was arrested under FIR no. 30 of 2018 registered under sections 13B, 17, 18, 18B, 19, 39 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.The FIR is of the year 2018, but it was not clear why she was arrested now. “The arrest was done in compliance of provisions of law and she has been under legally sanctioned custody at the women police station in Anantnag ever since her arrest,” a police statement said.The police alleged that Bano is involved in a serious criminal case besides toting an automatic weapon, posing next to her son in a photo. “She is involved in much more serious offences and her role has surfaced in recruiting at least two youths into militant ranks, arranging arms ammunition, communication and logistics for militants and terror organisations,” the statement said.The statement added that just because she happens to be a woman or the mother of a slain terrorist does not make her immune to arrest. “Anyone who wishes to challenge the decision is free to approach the court of law for redressal,” it said.The police also claimed that many social media posts have been generated and shared which have “twisted the facts to disturb peace and tranquility”.“Police have taken cognizance of the matter and anyone trying to instigate others through whatsoever means will be prosecuted against,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/arrest-of-militant-s-mom-don-t-target-family-members-without-evidence-says-j-k-police/story-3ciNiNv7at8ON2NfCf5tHK.html

28-06-2020||Chandigarh||Bhiwani spinning mill sacked infected workers, alleges MP Dharambir Singh||BJP member of parliament (MP) from Bhiwani- Mahendergarh constituency Dharambir Singh on Sunday alleged that Bhiwani’s biggest spinning mill, Grasim Bhiwani Textiles Limited (GBTL) mill, has been forcing its employees to resign, including those who were tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The Bhiwani administration had directed the mill authorities to shut its operations after over 40 employees and their contacts were found positive last week. In his letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, the BJP MP has urged them to resume work at the mill and ensure that the workers weren’t sacked. Dharambir Singh said the mill workers were facing a financial crunch. “Nearly 3,000 workers were working at this grand-old spinning mill before the lockdown was imposed. More than 300 of them have left for their native places as the mill authorities forced them to resign because some of them and their contacts tested positive for the virus,” he added. Amid a crisis, the MP said, the mill authorities were playing a ‘cruel game’ by sacking its employees. “Those tested positive and living in the BTM Line area and nearby four colonies are struggling to get drinking water, milk and basic supplies. The administration should arrange food for them,” he added. GBTL mill’s general manager (GM) Kaushal Tanwar had issued a notice on May 7, stating that the workers will be paid 50% of their basic salary and DA and the deducted amount will be reimbursed in instalments in future. However, workers claimed that the mill authorities gave each of them Rs 9,000 as a loan in April and since then, they have been waiting for their salaries. Congress’ Tosham MLA Kiran Choudhry said both the mill authorities as well as the district administration have failed to provide basic amenities to GBTL workers. “Due to shortage of money, the workers are forced to starve and neither the administration nor the mill authorities are providing food to poor workers, including those infected with the virus. If their issues are not addressed within two days, I will observe a sit-in outside the deputy commissioner’s office,” she added. Meanwhile, mill’s GM Kaushal Tanwar termed the allegations baseless and said that they had been providing food to their workers residing in BTM Line areas and other adjacent colonies. “We are not sacking our employees. In fact, we are taking care of our infected workers’ family members,” Tanwar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bhiwani-spinning-mill-sacked-infected-workers-alleges-mp-dharambir-singh/story-jaWbFTIe5wgSbTyghaZAxJ.html

While the process currently takes several months, the new online facility is expected to cut the approval time to 25 days. It will also simplify the process, which is currently marred by repeated visits to the estate office in Sector 17.All building plans – new construction and modification in the old, will be submitted on the web portal – www.obps.chd.gov.in. Only architects empanelled with the UT administration will be able to submit the applications.Chandigarh Smart City Ltd (CSCL) is implementing the project, which was awarded to a private consultancy firm in November last year.“The testing of the online module has been completed, but user trials are underway. Along with the users, architects are being trained on how to use the website,” said a senior UT official, privy to the development.The project is part of the e-governance project under which 28 services will be taken online. These include 14 government-to-citizen services and 14 internal processes of the municipal corporation.UT’s previous attempt to start the online plan approval system in October 2018 failed within one year of its launch. Thereafter, it decided to hand over the work to CSCL, which floated the tender for providing online services to the estate office also.ONLINE ASSESSMENT AND NOC“After architects upload applications on the website, the online system will scrutinise the plans based on city’s building rules and zoning plans. It will either accept the application and forward it to the dealing branch or will reject it for re-submission.

Dharamshala-based Central Tibetan Administration, also known as Tibetan government-in-exile, Lobsang Sangay asked the international community to “unite and ensure that China fulfils its obligations under international laws including human rights obligations before it is too late”.In a statement issued on Sunday, Sangay said that on Saturday 50 UN independent experts from 30 UN Special Procedure mandate called on the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to “act with a sense of urgency” and take appropriate decisive measures including a special session and establishment of a special rapporteur to protect fundamental freedoms in China occupied regions including Tibet, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang.“The Central Tibetan Administration and Tibetans from both inside and outside Tibet would like to thank the UN experts for their timely intervention and welcome their call for urgent decisive measures against the government of China,” he said.Sangay said that In the last six decades and more, Tibetans within Tibet were suffering under the authoritarian rule of China.The Chinese government has stripped off Tibetans of their basic human rights guaranteed under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, annihilating the distinct identity of Tibetans and denying them their inherent dignity of being human, he added.He said that tortures, enforced disappearances, and destructions of monasteries carried out by China against Tibetans were acts of crimes against humanity and do not fall short of being categorised as “cultural genocide.The persecution and suppression via high-tech surveillance by China, Sangay said, have forced 154 Tibetans from different walks of life in Tibet to self-immolate as a mark of peaceful protest against the Chinese authorities since 2009.The unchecked, systemic, and egregious violations by the Chinese regime with impunity in Tibet have emboldened it to carry out similar violations in Xinjiang and now Hong Kong.It is time to hold China accountable otherwise it will have an adverse global impact as evidenced by the Wuhan originated Covid-19 pandemic. As rightly noted by the UN experts, the violations by China are threatening world peace and security leading to human rights emergencies across the globe, he said.CTA and the Tibetans from both inside and outside Tibet strongly support the call of the UN experts on the UN Human Rights Council to take urgent measures against the Chinese human rights violations.We strongly urge the UNHRC and the member states to hold a special session to evaluate the human rights violations being carried out by China and to establish a country mandate of UN Special Rapporteur on China to monitor, analyse and report annually on the human rights situation in Tibet and other occupied regions, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cta-govt-in-exile-seeks-special-unhrc-session-to-examine-tibetans-right-breaches-by-china/story-VtRCBBtp8Cdqls6qQUHI0H.html

28-06-2020||Bangalore||Siddaramaiah demands white paper from Karnataka govt on Covid-19 management||Senior Congress leader Siddaramaiah on Sunday urged the Karnataka government to bring out a “white paper” regarding its Covid-19 management.Alleging lack of transparency on part of the government in controlling the spread of virus, the former Chief Minister said, this has led to ‘mistrust’ among the people about the administration.Citing allegations of irregularity in the purchase of medical equipment by paying twice the market rate, he threatened the government of agitation, if it continues to remain indifferent to the demand for white paper and transparency. “As the Karnataka government has not maintained transparency in its measures to control the spread of coronavirus, it has given rise to suspicion, insecurity among people,” Siddaramaiah said.In a statement released by his office, he urged Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa to bring out a white paper regarding measures taken and money spent so far, to place the truth before the people and instill trust in them.With the spike in the number of infections in the state, Opposition Congress has accused the government of ‘failing’ to manage the Covid-19 situation.The number of Covid-19 cases in the state which stood at 3,408 as of June 1, reported 11,923 on Saturday with the capital city topping the districts in the infection count.Siddaramaiah in his statement has demanded an account on the money spent by the government for Covid-19 treatment and related activities.“How much money has been spent from the state’s treasury to control coronavirus? it has been spent on what purpose? How much has been spent so far on quarantine, treatment, PPE kits, ventilators, oxygen cylinders, masks, sanitisers and other medical equipment?” he asked. Questioning as to how much money and equipment have come from the Centre, he wanted to know about the number of beds reserved at private hospitals for corona treatment, the basis on which rates have been fixed for private hospitals. “All this information has to be placed before the people.” Claiming that despite several letters by him seeking details, the departments were not sharing the information properly.The Congress legislature party leader alleged that such denial of information amounts to breach of his privilege. “It also gives rise to suspicion regarding the functioning of the government.So complete details have to be made known to the people through the white paper,” he added.The government has not made any preparations to control Covid-19 in the last three months, other than wasting its time in imposing and withdrawing lockdown measures, Siddaramaiah said, the people of the state will have to face the sufferings because of this “inactiveness”. “With the infection spreading, people are losing trust in the government”, he said adding that as the government hospitals are filled, the administration has to convince the private hospitals regarding the rates and ask them to provide treatment or else should take strict action against them. Noting that there were allegations of irregularity in the purchase of medical equipment and that they have been brought by paying the price double than the market rate, Siddaramaiah said, “it is alleged that- the amount is said to be about Rs 3300 crore.So the government should immediately come out with a white paper, provide facts and take the public into confidence.” It will be inevitable to protest on the streets if the government continues to remain indifferent to our demand, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/siddaramaiah-demands-white-paper-from-karnataka-govt-on-covid-19-management/story-cM3cKm61xdpOMrI1nunXCM.html

No one knows how it is controlled or money given to it utilised. The Fund is not even subjected to audit by any public authority, including CAG. The PMO has gone to the extent of saying that this Fund is not a public authority,” said the PPCC chief, adding that it is not even subjected to RTI. “All in all, the fund appears to be solely run by the Prime Minister in an opaque and secret fashion with zero transparency and zero accountability,” he said while quoting reports that suggest that as on May 20, 2020, PM Modi had received Rs 9,678 crore in the controversial Fund. The state party chief further said, “The Modi government continued to sidestep the brazen Chinese transgressions and occupation of our territory by the Chinese forces in Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso Lake area, Hot Springs and Depsang Plains up to the Y-Junction while misleading the nation by claiming that China has never intruded into the Indian Territory, nor is it in occupation of any territory.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/come-clear-on-donations-to-pm-cares-fund-from-chinese-companies-jakhar/story-IHpNQQyRe14TPec4nd67pL.html

The exercise was launched on June 26.Another official said Southwest Delhi has reported a rise of 37 containment zones since the re-mapping exercise was launched, taking the number of such areas in the district to 80.According to a list of the Covid-19 containment zones issued by the government, there are 421 such areas in the national capital.North Delhi district has 59 containment zones, followed by South Delhi (56), Central Delhi (40), Shahdara (38), East Delhi (33) Southeast Delhi(32), Northwest Delhi (28), West Delhi (25), New Delhi (21) and Northeast Delhi (nine).“Till Saturday night, we have screened around two lakh people for Covid-19 in a house-to-house survey being conducted across the city.

Assured him all possible held from the Centre for Bihar people’s safety,” he tweeted from his Twitter handle.Mahananda is one of the prime tributaries of the Ganga river in the eastern part of India. It originates from the hills of Darjeeling flows through Kishanganj, Purnia and Katihar districts in Bihar.Due to unrelenting rain, there has been consistent rise in the water level of Mahananda river. This could pose flood threat to districts falling under its domain if a similar trend continues. Due to timely monsoon and heavy rain in the catchment areas, the water level in some rivers has already been on rise. Mahananda crossed the danger mark on Saturday, inundating low lying areas. The meteorological department has forecast more heavy rain the coming days.While other rivers in the state have shown receding trend after reaching danger level, Mahananda has crossed the danger mark at a few places and maintains its rising trend. On the left embankment slightly ahead of Jhaua bridge in Katihar, a spur had also been damaged due to water pressure. In Purnia, the river has maintained its rising trend.According to projection of the water resource department (WRD), of the 36 stations, rivers have reached above the danger mark at 13 of them. All rivers, except the Ganga, have maintained rising trend. “We are keeping a close watch on the water level in the Mahananda. At present, the situation is under control. The affected part of the spur has been repaired. In Kishanganj, the level has fallen, but it is not so in Purnea and Katihar,” said Katihar district magistrate Kanwal Tanuj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shah-dials-nitish-as-mahananda-swells-after-heavy-rain/story-aELtc3T7NyJFNj6wKfmT4N.html

In this case it is the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/over-14-in-kolkata-have-covid-19-antibodies-icmr-seroprevalence-survey/story-Rf5DYeRnUmYNP97XjPzjnO.html
28-06-2020||Chandigarh||Sale of Chinese products drops in Chandigarh after boycott calls||The sale of Chinese products has been hit in the city after calls to boycott Chinese goods were given post the Galwan Valley face-off between the Indian troops and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China.Traders say that there are no takers for electronics, 90% of which are Chinese.President of Radha Mobile Market in Sector 22B, Maninder Ahuja, said, “The anti-China wave has hit both the sale and repair of mobile phones. Earlier, Chinese phones would sell the most, and from over 10 phones a day, we can manage to sell 4 or 5 phones now. People are going for alternatives even though they may be a little more expensive.”Due to tensions between the two countries, spare parts for Chinese phones were also becoming hard to procure. “For repairing a damaged screen, the cost has almost doubled. Rather than repairing the screen of a Chinese phone for ₹5,000, people are preferring to put in more money to get a new phone,” Ahuja added.Sale of other electronic items such as lights has also been affected, but more from the shopkeepers’ end. RP Gupta, chairman of the Sector 18 Electronics Market Dealers Association, said, “Earlier the market was predominantly filled with Chinese lights, but now people are buying branded LED lights. Shopkeepers, too, aren’t stocking Chinese lights anymore.”‘INDIAN PRODUCTS NO MATCH’As per Anil Dhingra, the proprietor of Ad’s Mobile Arcade in Sector 22B, people are trying to look for alternatives, but they still end up purchasing Chinese gadgets. “Chinese phones are loaded with features for lower prices, so there really is no other option,” he said.Most toys in Chandigarh are also made in China, however, as per Shrey Budhiraja, proprietor of Budhiraja Toys Center in Sector 22, it is impractical to totally boycott Chinese made goods. “There is no infrastructure for bulk producing battery-powered toys in India. Customers also opt for Chinese made toys, so it would take some effort to switch to Indian toys,” he said. The Chandigarh Beopar Mandal hasn’t officially told traders to boycott Chinese products, president Anil Vohra confirmed, adding that some members had taken the initiative on their own. “We are definitely against Chinese products, but it is important that traders not suffer. We will gradually shift to Indian-produced goods once they become available in the markets,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sale-of-chinese-products-drops-in-chandigarh-after-boycott-calls/story-x6PD4tHByteOF0fxw6YvQP.html

28-06-2020||City||Srijan scamCBI files chargesheet against ex-IAS officer and JD(U) leader After serving on key posts, K P Ramaiah took VRS and fought 2014 LS polls from Sasaram||PATNA The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is probing the multi-crore Srijan scam, filed three separate charge-sheets on Saturday before the special court in Patna against 60 accused, including former Bhagalpur district magistrate and JD (U) leader K P Ramaiah. Ramaiah, a 1986-batch IAS officer of Bihar cadre, has also served as principal secretary of scheduled castes/tribe welfare department and secretary of Mahadalit Commission, before joining the JD (U) in 2014, when he unsuccessfully contested Lok Sabha election from Sasaram constituency. He is the second formed DM of Bhagalpur to be charge-sheeted in the case. Earlier, 2004-batch IAS officer Birendra Prasad Yadav, currently posted as special secretary (backward class and extremely backward classes) at the state’s social welfare department, was charge-sheeted. The Srijan scam involves fraudulent transfer of more than Rs 2,000 crore from government’s bank accounts in Bhagalpur to Srijan Mahila Vikash Sahyog Samiti (SMVSS), an NGO which claimed to be working for the uplift of women in different districts. The cases first came to light in August 2017 and the CBI took over the case the same month.Others already charge-sheeted in the case include Manorma Devi (late), founder secretary of the SMVSS, manager Sarita Jha, director Subha Laxmi Jha, secretary Rajni Priya and her husband Amit Kumar, besides the then chief managers, then branch managers and other officials of Bank of Baroda and Indian Bank.Manorama Devi, who reportedly flaunted her connections with politicians and bureaucrats and helped Srijan spread its tentacles. About Ramaiah, the CBI has found that he, as DM of Bhagalpur in 2011, allowed opening of bank accounts in SMVSS with the help of then deputy collector (nazarat) Vijay Kumar and depositing Rs 3.5 crore in two separate accounts. During investigation, the premier agency found that there were illegal transfers and misuse of funds from government accounts in Bhagalpur district to accounts of the SMVSS through a conspiracy hatched between government officials, including DMs and office bearers of the NGO, between 2003 and 2014.In another case, Ramaiah has also been accused of embezzlement of funds meant for the uplift of scheduled caste/tribe students through imparting training in computer courses. Bihar’s vigilance department had found he was wrongly disbursing Rs 2.24 crore only two days before his voluntary retirement.Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Sunday accused CM Nitish Kumar of having patronised the tainted former bureaucrat. “The chief minister should explain why an accused in the Srijan scam is being patronised by the JD(U). After all, what is so special about Ramaiah that the JD(U) had given him ticket during parliamentary polls and later appointed him as member of the land tribunal when he lost the election,” said Tejashwi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/srijan-scamcbi-files-chargesheet-against-ex-ias-officer-and-jd-u-leader-after-serving-on-key-posts-k-p-ramaiah-took-vrs-and-fought-2014-ls-polls-from-sasaram/story-EfAqCDKR9uPXpEQD5yqUVM.html
28-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police reaches out to personnel to address stress||Delhi Police personnel have been among the frontline workers during the Covid-19 outbreak, which has not only put them at a greater physical health risk but also amplified their stress levels due to personal reasons, officials said.There is a 30-year-old constable who now sanitises his hands at a gap of every two or three minutes and remains isolated from family members even at home. He also has sleep disorders now that developed around March 15, when the pandemic threat had started to peak, they said.In another case, a 42-year-old sub-inspector, who lost his mother due to Covid-19, is overly stressed thinking he or his family might contract the infection now.A woman personnel, who is spending more time at home during the pandemic, is tensed because her family wants her to get married but she feels that as a sole bread earner of the family she needs to take care of her younger brother, who has health issues, and her elderly mother.There are also personnel who are stressed due to domestic issues like some property dispute in their native districts outside Delhi, or physical health issues such as blood pressure or diabetes too.Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Delhi Police has initiated a campaign to reach out to its personnel who are distressed due to personal or health issues and provide them with expert professional help, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Sanjay Bhatia said.The campaign, ‘Healthy Police, Happy Police,’ has been initiated by the central district, which has a staff of 2,705 personnel, several of whom have informed their seniors about stress due to personal reasons and have sought counselling, he said.The whole process is confidential to respect the privacy of police personnel seeking help, the DCP said.“In the time of the spread of coronavirus pandemic, police personnel are performing duties under challenging circumstances. This not only results in physical but also psychological stress,” Bhatia said. “Under the campaign, all police personnel posted in the district were sent a health problem questionnaire and their health status was taken in a sealed envelope. “These health-related problems were classified under three categories-physical problems, psychological stress and domestic problems. Based on the information received a counselling session will be held periodically, whereby the problems of police personnel will be heard by expert physicians, psychologists and domestic problem counsellors and expert guidance will be provided,” he said.A total of 2,705 such forms were distributed to the personnel in the central district and so far 1,500 filled forms have returned, they said.Around 150 personnel, which include both male and female, have sought help for stress issues, while another 100 have sought administrative assistance for other problems, like leave or work hours, the officials told PTI.The first such session with a batch of 30 personnel in attendance took counselling from professionals on June 26, they said.“The police approach is to identify such cases among its personnel and provide them help so that problems do not escalate. It is to ensure the overall wellbeing of our personnel,” Additional DCP Sikandar Singh said.“We will provide them with counselling and also follow up their cases by seeking their feedback on counselling sessions to know if it is really helping them. Any changes required will be made accordingly,” Singh said.Clinical Psychologist Kaartik Gupta, who was one of the expert counsellors who interacted with policemen as part of the ‘Healthy Police, Happy Police’ campaign, said he observed cases of anxiety, sleep disorder and stress during the first session on June 26.“Such health issues need more sessions of psychotherapy over a period of time. It is obvious that not many people open up with experts initially. In some cases, medication or long terms of psychotherapy could be required, which will be handled accordingly,” Gupta said.During the first session, the counsellors got an average 20 to 25 minutes each with a personnel with the experts saying this duration could ideally be around 45-50 minutes.Police officials said they are considering re-organising batch sizes for counselling sessions as it is only for the first time that some initiative like this has taken place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-government-allows-restro-bars-clubs-to-sell-beer-stock-expiring-by-july-15-to-liquor-shops/story-EtzWXAQ1KYIB5G900dpbNP.html

He has demanded the state government to issue strict orders to officials to only spend funds on projects for which it has been allotted.In a statement issued, Singh accused the state government of completely failing in solving problems of the people and said that Himachal is lagging behind in development and chief minister Jai Ram Thakur has not been able to introduce an effective scheme in his tenure of two and a half years.Singh said that the state government has not provided any relief to people amid coronavirus pandemic rather farmers and orchardists are being completely ignored. The government is not worried about increasing unemployment and has hiked rates of diesel and petrol, he added.He said that false sedition cases are being filed against anyone who is raising their voices against state and central government.He also lashed out at state’s Members of Parliament (MPs) and said that they kept promising about railway expansion in the state but nothing has been done till now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/speed-up-development-works-cong-leader-tells-shimla-admn/story-TkbL8QjfjZduditDDd4QdP.html
28-06-2020||City||Rival faction opens front against Himachal Congress chief Kuldeep Rathore||The infighting among Himachal Congress is out in the open as a rival faction has shot a letter to the central leadership against the state president Kuldeep Singh Rathore.Over half a dozen disgruntled Congress leaders, who owe allegiance to former minister Kaul Singh Thakur and former Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC) chief Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, held a meeting in Mandi expressing dissatisfaction over Rathore’s “unilateral” functioning.They also wrote a letter to the All India Congress Committee (AICC) chief Sonia Gandhi seeking her intervention in the matter. The signatory of the letter included Lal Singh Kaushal, Jiwan Thakur, Pawan Thakur, Champa Thakur, who contested the 2017 assembly elections unsuccessfully and former minister Mansa Ram, among others.In the letter, the rebel leaders alleged that Rathore did not consult the senior party leaders while reshuffling or dissolving and reconstitution of Pradesh Congress Committee, district or block units.“Such people who are not even the primary members of the party have been appointed on key organisational posts. Some of them even worked against the party’s official candidates during the 2017 assembly election, resulting in an embarrassing defeat for the party,” they alleged.The mishandling of affairs by the current president was also reflected in party’s dismal performance in 2019 general elections and assembly by-election wherein the Congress candidates forfeited their deposit and the party’s vote share dropped from 48% to just 17%, they added.They said the day-to-day working of the present party setup in the state was not satisfactory, particularly when it comes to opposing the anti-people policies of the BJP government“The Congress missed a great opportunity to corner the government when a scam surfaced in the health department. This happened due to wrong ₹20 crore expenditure shown by the HPCC chief in the fight against Covid-19. There was no evidence to corroborate the claims and Congress party came on a back foot,” said the anti-Rathore group.The rival faction further wrote that the senior Congress leaders in the state were also unhappy with the way things were going and held a brainstorming session at the state capital to rejuvenate the party.“It’s high time that the AICC intervened in the state leadership to boost the morale of the ground-level workers,” they said, requesting the high command to set up a high-level coordination committee of senior leaders for better handling of party affairs in the state.Meanwhile, Rathore has termed the letter a conspiracy of the ruling BJP against him.“Some BJP leaders have orchestrated the whole episode. However, I will not fight my own people, but the battle against fascist BJP regime will continue,” said Rathore adding that his objective was to further the agenda of the high command.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rival-faction-opens-front-against-himachal-congress-chief-kuldeep-rathore/story-PUiYrcMmL3GrN1BoTPGWLO.html
28-06-2020||City||Bihar minister, wife test positive for Covid-19||Bihar’s Backward and Extremely Backward Classes Welfare Minister Vinod Kumar Singh and his wife tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday and were sent to an isolation ward at a city hotel in Katihar district, officials said. Katihar District Magistrate Kanwal Tanuj confirmed that both the minister and his wife have tested positive for the pathogen. The couple has been kept at an isolation ward created at a city hotel here, the DM said. Singh, who is a BJP legislator from Pranpur, said his samples were tested in Patna and he returned to Katihar from the state capital on Sunday. The minister said when he came to know about his test report, he first went to Katihar Medical College and Hospital and thereafter to the isolation ward of a hotel in the town. People who came in contact with the minister will be traced to collect their samples for testing, the DM said. This is the first incident when a minister of the Nitish Kumar government has tested positive for Covid-19. Earlier on June 22, a sitting BJP MLA Jibesh Kumar Mishra tested positive for the virus. He was admitted to AIIMS, Patna for treatment and supervision. The MLA was the first sitting member of the bicameral legislature in the state to have been tested positive for Covid-19. Earlier, veteran RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, a former Union minister, was admitted to the hospital after testing positive for coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bihar-minister-wife-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-6NaTdnTmWQ6Gh6wFewOoDP.html
28-06-2020||City||Team inspects damaged bungalows of MLCs, assures repair||PATNAA team of officials of the building construction department (BCD) led by its executive engineer carried out inspection of official residence of MLC Prem Chandra Mishra and others on Sunday to assess the scale of repair the premises required.Failing to draw the government’s attention towards faulty and poor construction of the MLCs’ bungalows, which developed cracks and seepages within months of construction, Mishra had written to BCD principal secretary Chanchal Kumar to ensure immediate repair and sought a high-level inquiry into the construction.“The BCD team visited my bungalow and gave with an assurance to get it repaired soon,” said Mishra.“Not only the MLC ’ bungalows, all recent constructions done by the BCD like Bihar Museum, Police Building and annexe building of the state legislature have been facing cracks and seepages,” claimed Mishra.Alleging compromise in quality of construction, Mishra had raised a question in the state Legislative Council during the monsoon session last year (in July 2019). “The entrances are secured with thin fibre sheets, which could be broke open easily,” Mishra had alleged.BCD minister Ashok Choudhary, along with Mishra and officials, had inspected the premises in August last year and assured to fix iron grills at the entry points by September-October. “That could, however, not be complied with as yet,” claimed the Congress legislator.In November last year, Mishra had returned the key to BCD principal secretary Chanchal Kumar saying the cracks were not repaired and taps in bathrooms and kitchen ran dry due to faulty supply network. In January this year, Mishra received the key and entered the bungalows after the BCD officials assured that water supply has been restored and cracks were maintained.According to Mishra, he urged BCD minister Choudhary again for repair work as he was facing umpteen problems due to sub-standard quality of construction in January this year. However, the minister told him that the BCD had transferred the possession of the premises to the Legislative Council and the Council secretariat should look into it.Mishra again raised the issue in the Council during the last Budget session, which was curtailed abruptly due to Covid outbreak, but his question was not taken up, nor had the government supplied any written answer to it. “Problems of construction were not limited to my house only. All the bungalows of MLCs are facing similar issues, which should be attended to by the government,” said Mishra.Minister Choudhary and principal secretary Chanchal Kumar could not be reached out for their comments despite repeated tries could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/team-inspects-damaged-bungalows-of-mlcs-assures-repair/story-obDjNSTQwQKUjuWOx0ysUM.html

28-06-2020||Pune||Safety on the mind as CSW look to resume work in Pune’s red-light area||We asks our customers to wear masks and use sanitisers while visiting us. We are also using masks and gloves as protection, but there is still this fear lurking in our minds about hygiene and protection from the virus, says ‘Kamla’, who has been working at Budhwar peth as a commercial sex worker (CSW) since a long time. She is one of the 2,000 CSWs working in the Pune’s oldest and largest red-light area, in existence since the Peshwa era. Most of those working here are from West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. For the past three months, Kamla and most like her, were sitting at home without work. However, now business has resumed as Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has excluded the area from the containment zones’ list.The three months of lockdown was tough for many of the CSWs, and as they look to resume work, there is apprehension among them about the spread of Covid-19. With masks, gloves and video chat on their mind as preventive measures, these women with the help of the NGO Saheli have laid out certain Standard Operating Procedure (SOPs).‘Kajal’ has been part of Budhwar peth for past 12 years as a CSW and it was for the first time that she used ‘phone sex’ for her regular customer. “Phone sex is a new thing for me and I feel shy during the process. I am yet to get use to it,” said Kajal, who acquired her this name after coming here.After PMC opened the area, Kamla stepped out to “find a customer” and also to collect ration that was being distributed by the local NGO working in the area. “We are changing the sheets frequently. It has been tough to meet my day-to-day needs during the past three months of lockdown. We get ration from NGOs, but it is not enough,” said Kamla, who acquired her name after coming here. Among the many NGOs working in Budhwar peth, Saheli HIV AIDS Karyakarta Sangh is once holding special advisory sessions on safety for CSWs during Covid-19 pandemic and is also encouraging them to use the phone for their regular customers.“When we were called for a meeting with the police to announce that Budhwar peth was no longer a containment zone and that they could resume their work, four days ago, we are constantly thinking of how best to offer protection to these women,” said Tejasvi Sevekari, executive director, Saheli.“Their job has physical involvement and despite masks and gloves, there is still a risk of the infection. Hence, we began an advocacy programme and have been sharing videos about phone sex,” she said.With the rising number of Covid-19 cases earlier in the area, police had shut the red light area on March 19, thus leaving no means of earning for the 3,000 CSWs. Almost 1,000 of them went back home, while 2,000 of them are still in the area.Most of them are looking forward to earning their money. “I used to make around Rs18,000 to Rs 20,000 a month, I am hoping to get at least few customers in the day if possible,” said Kamla.“Some of the CSWs have also pulled in money to buy sets of gloves, sanitisers and masks, although we are providing them with basic masks, as they want to resume activities with as much safety as possible,” said Sevekari.Sevekari is apprehensive too about CSWs resuming their work. “Until now there were no cases of Covid-19, but with customers visiting, there are chances of spreading of the virus.”“We are appealing to the government, if any funding could be worked out for the protection of CSWs. This will at least help them financially until the fear of this virus is gone,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/safety-on-the-mind-as-csw-look-to-resume-work-in-pune-s-red-light-area/story-kqU8Ck47Y9CVAT4U5FasWO.html
28-06-2020||Pune||Corruption worth ₹8.2 lakh in tree-plantation drive at Seven Loves chowk, reveals RTI||Members of the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) party have alleged corruption worth Rs 8.2 lakh in a tree-plantation project at Seven Loves Chowk in Pune.The case came to light when the party representatives asked for details of the work done around the flyover.“We had filed an RTI application on the name of the flyover bridge which was changed around a year ago from Lahuji Vasdat to Atal Bihari Vajpayee. In a fight to get it back, we filed an RTI application asking for details of the official work that was done by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) while building the flyover,” said Atul Nade, member of VBA and a resident of Seven Loves Chowk area who filed the RTI applciation.The garden department chief superintendent, who had initially refused to accept that the information was provided by his department through RTI, late shrugged responsibility of the knowledge of the bills.“It has the stamp of the garden superintendent and not the chief garden superintendent. Therefore, since he is the appellant authority, he is answerable for it,” said Ashok Ghorpade, chief superintendent of PMC garden department.An amount of Rs 9.64 lakh was locked-in from the budget meant for the garden department. The title of the tender dated December 16, 2017 was to award the work to a private company to develop a garden around the open grounds in the vicinity of the flyover at Seven Loves Chowk, as per the documents received in response to the RTI application.The description of the work is planting of Ashoka trees on the divider on the road-stretch between Seven Loves chowk and AD Camp and installation of a net around it. However, no trees can be found on the divider of the road.“When the proposal was floated, it was sent to the road development department. To get a locking amount sanctioned, they sent the proposal to us as the issue is related to tree plantation which is our area of expertise. It was duly audited internally and then sanctioned. However, on the ground, the reality must have changed and the trees must have been planted around the area - which in this case was under and along the bridge. The confusion is caused by the words used for description at the beginning of the tender process and in the end. After all, the bills submitted by the company were of the work they finally did and not what was proposed on paper,” said a senior official of the garden department who was closely involved in the process and did not wish to be named.On December 10, 2019, a refund stamp of Rs 8,20,592 to the private company is seen on the tender document.“We asked for the specifics of the bills that amount to Rs 8.2 lakh which were refunded and they are not ready to show them,” said Nade.However, the RTI response provides bills for other kinds of trees which the PMC officials claim were planted under and near the flyover bridge.“The cost of a 3-4 feet tall tree is anywhere between Rs 20-30. A bigger tree, around 5-10 feet tall, will cost anywhere around Rs 1,000-Rs 1,500. The ideal distance at which an Ashoka tree should be planted is 8 feet but it is generally seen planted at a distance of 5-6 feet. Sometimes it is purposely planted at a shortened distance in order for the foliage of consecutive trees to form a wall. Therefore, without the details of how they intended to plant the trees, it is difficult to estimate the cost,” said Suresh Pingale, secretary of agri-horticulture society of western India that manages the Empress Botanical garden. There are two species of Ashoka. The true Ashoka (Sita Ashok) is named as Saraca asoka which is a medicinal plant, and the so-called Ashoka (which is commonly grown as avenue trees) is named as Polyalthia longifolia. The Polyalthia longifolia has a dimension of About 3 Meters (Diameter of the tree canopy) so the minimum distance between two successive Ashoka trees can be 5-10 Meters for their proper growth and to provide sufficient space for the canopy formation. The cost of tree guard is Rs. 200 per number for plastic or Rs. 800 per number for steel (As per Indiamart Prices),” said Professor Avinash B Ade of the Botany department of Savitribai Phule Pune University.Given that the tender description mentions tall trees, the budget of Rs 9.9 lakh can accommodate around 660 trees, excluding the cost of safety and labour. However, upon inspection of the site, only a metal divider can be seen on the site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/corruption-worth-8-2-lakh-in-tree-plantation-drive-at-seven-loves-chowk-reveals-rti/story-WxhFfBLsuUe0CtIwf7ioBK.html

28-06-2020||Pune||50% ventilators at dedicated Covid-19 hospitals in Pune occupied; shortage of medical staff likely: experts||Even as the city’s recovery rate is over 58 per cent as of June 26 and the mortality rate remains below four per cent at 3.8 per cent, the number of critical patients is on the rise, according to Pune Municipal Corporation data. Out of the 5,575 active cases as of Friday, 330 are in critical condition which is about 5.9 per cent of the active cases, according to PMC data. Also, out of the 580 beds without ventilators, 230 are occupied and 60 ICU beds with ventilator are occupied out of 288 beds.Increase in critical cases means that there is added pressure on the health infrastructure and medical experts. Shekhar Gaikwad, PMC commissioner, said, “Only private hospitals have the required number of ventilators and ICU beds and so we will regulate more private hospitals.”“The critical patients are those who have comorbidity or have reported late to the hospital. Those who seek regular treatment for a few days at the right time do not usually need critical care service,” he added.Out of the total 18,556 available beds, 580 are ICU beds and 288 are ICU beds with ventilators. These also included regulated beds from private hospitals. The 16 private hospitals have 189 beds are ICU beds with oxygen and 85 ICU beds with ventilators which are regulated as per the state government’s GR on May 21. Out of these 50% are reserved for Covid-19 patients.The civic body’s projection states that by July 31, the city will see over 40,000 cases and will fall short of 340 ICU beds and 172 ventilator beds. However, even if the civic body fulfils the required shortage, the city is likely to face a shortage of medical experts like intensivists required to look after patients who are in a critical condition. Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president, Indian Medical Association (Maharashtra chapter), said, “The government is now resorting to asking general physicians to work as intensivists in Covid-19 wards. One of our members has been asked to work in the Covid-19 ward of Sassoon hospital who is a general practitioner.”“The government is filling the pinch of shortage of expert doctors who would take care of critical patients which is why it is resorting to such methods. How can a general practitioner attend to an ICU ward?” said Dr Bhondwe.According to Gaikwad, it is not possible for the PMC to fill in the vacant posts overnight which were left unattended for the past 50 years. “Regulating more and more private hospitals is the only way for which we will start the process once again from Monday. It takes at least 2-3 days to ensure that the private hospitals follow the regulation and update their data on the dashboard,” he said.To fill in the requirement of medical experts, the civic body is hiring five MBBS doctors, 73 BAMS doctors, 111 junior nurses, 125 ANM (Auxiliary Nurse Midwife), 34 lab technicians and 50 assistant lab technicians and six doctors and 22 nurses under the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/50-ventilators-at-dedicated-covid-19-hospitals-in-pune-occupied-shortage-of-medical-staff-likely-experts/story-c8l5l3Ia7wyrQi1QccbhkJ.html
28-06-2020||Pune||Pune-Mumbai expressway now ‘safer’ after bridge demolition||For thousands of commuters driving on the Pune-Mumbai expressway, it has been a different experience in the ghat section after 190-year-old British-era Amrutanjan bridge was demolished during the first week of April.For those regularly passing through the stretch, removal of the bridge has added another lane and negotiating a curve has been “easier” and “safer”, maintained drivers. Expressway police say there have been no accidents at the spot since April 5, when the bridge was demolished and traffic movement was slow due to the lockdown.“Earlier, there were only two lanes where bridge had been standing and vehicles had to slow down there. Now with three lanes on one side of the carriageway, traffic movement has been smooth,” said Parshuram Bohir, a traffic constable of the highway police. “Generally accidents of dimensional cargo (ODC) trucks used to take place at the spot as the slope is steep here. Pune-bound heavy vehicles used to get stuck there, but now with more space there is no delay,” added Bohir.Built in 1830, the bridge was used for transit of goods trains between Pune and Mumbai in the initial years which was stopped later. Traffic jams were the norms at the location of the bridge because of its massive piers and mishaps also used to occur due to breakdown of heavy vehicles.With movement of goods being allowed completely after the lockdown, the expressway has regained life, however, traffic is only at 50 per cent capacity.“My car passed through the stretch easily. Earlier, I had to slow my vehicle down, but now I can continue with the same speed on the expressway,” said Amar Shitole, a regular commuter between Pune and Mumbai. Sumit Sawant, another commuter, said, “There used to be a lot of confusion due to the bridge. It is a completely different experience now and I passed the same spot without changing my lane, which was not possible earlier.”To discipline vehicles, highway police have marked lanes with white markers, which is only being partially followed, according to officials. The heavy vehicles, which are supposed to be using the left lane often use the right lane. “We have been penalising those who do not follow the lane norms. Overall, pulling down of the Amrutanjan bridge has helped in reducing traffic congestion at the spot. Vehicles pass through with ease and there are now very low chances of accidents,” said Jagdish Pardeshi, assistant police inspector (Sahayak police nirakshak), highway police, Dasturi.Anup Nadole, a truck driver, says, “I do not face any issue now while turning the turn due to the wide lanes.” “There is less traffic congestion as earlier the left side lanes were smaller and hence, heavy trucks were not able to pass through, but now it has been broadened,” explained Bhaskar Khade, police naik, highway police, Dasturi.Mobility experts, however, question the demolition of the bridge, saying that it may not be the solution to the traffic problem. Pranjali Deshpande, transport planner and an independent consultant with the World Bank and French development bank, said, “Razing the bridge was strange. Why did the existing condition not considered when the expressway was being made? The demolition could be required for safety reasons, but the authorities should improve the safety of the entire expressway. In the long run, if we want safer modes of commutation, then, we need to shift our focus to intercity buses and railways rather than building more highways.”Sujit Patwardhan, founder and trustee of NGO Parisar, said, “If they have demolished the Amrutanjan bridge with a view that it will reduce accidents, then it does not make sense. How one can expect reduced number of accidents if you allow vehicles to move at a high speed. The move will not help and the public and administration should understand the value of heritage sites.”Brief history of the British-era bridgeAmrutanjan bridge was built 190 years ago and the railway bridge was opened on November 10, 1830, as a key connector between Pune and Mumbai.It got the name Amrutanjan because of the large advertisement hoarding of its namesake at the location.It later served as the third line for the railways on the Bhor ghat section to reverse engines, but it was stopped after more powerful engines were introduced.The wide pillars of the bridge caused steep turns int he ghat section causing many accidents on the expressway.MSRDC received permission to demolish the bridge in 2017. Due to heavy traffic flow on the expressway, MSRDC had not been able to complete the task. With the lockdown underway and almost negligible traffic, MSRDC sought permission to pull it down, again.The bridge was demolished with the help of a controlled blast by MSRDC on April 5. Holes were drilled at 15 to 20 locations on each of its six piers.On April 5, at 6:20pm, the bridge was demolished by simultaneous detonations.Accident comparisonsJan-May 2019Total fatal accidents: 34- No of dead: 40Total serious accidents: 22- No of injured: 53Total minor accidents: 7 - No of injured: 7Total accidents without injuries: 54Jan-May 2020Total fatal accidents: 16 - No of dead: 17Total serious accidents: 10 - No of injured: 20Total minor accidents: 8- No of injured: 8Total accidents without injuries: 12Total overall accidents:January-MayTotal accidents in 2019: 117Total accidents in 2020: 46||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-mumbai-expressway-now-safer-after-bridge-demolition/story-4TJN5pU5RHI8Inc0xp8PQI.html
28-06-2020||Mumbai||Uddhav Thackeray says Maharashtra lockdown to continue, hints at more eases after June 30||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Sunday the ongoing lockdown will not be lifted after its fifth phase ends on June 30 but indicated there will be more relaxations under the state government’s Mission Begin Again. Thackeray, who completed seven months in his office on Sunday, said the risk of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and the battle against the pandemic are not over yet, but the government is relaxing the curbs in a phased manner. The Shiv Sena chief said that the continuation of the lockdown curbs and their stricter implementations depends on citizens. CM Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray’s address to the State today; pic.twitter.com/jtickPoo7R“I have been getting requests from a few civic authorities for the permission for imposing stricter lockdown owing to the rising numbers. There are cases of violations of the curbs in some cities like Mumbai, Pune and even in rural areas,” Thackeray said while addressing the state through Facebook.“I am sure the citizens will continue to abide by the stricter norms of the lockdown but in case of violations of the curbs, we will have no options but to go for the stricter imposition of the lockdown again in the areas with a rise in the cases,” he added.Maharashtra is the worst-hit state by the coronavirus pandemic with a tally of to 159,133 out of which more than 74,000 cases are in Mumbai. Ten major cities, including Mumbai, continue to be classified as red zones with strict restrictions including no public transport. More than 7,200 people, including 4,284 in Mumbai, have succumbed to the respiratory disease in the state so far.Thackeray said that there will be a spike in infections in the next few weeks.“As we have been opening up the activities to ensure the revival of the economy, we have been witnessing the rise in the cases. Even in the near future, there will be a rise in the cases as we open up more activities,” he said. “But the state government is ready to take on the surge. We have increased the testing facilities. Instead of waiting for the virus to attack us, we have been chasing it. After it has proven to be successful in Mumbai, the ‘chase the virus’ drive is being implemented elsewhere in the state. It will help us in containing the spread,” he added.Thackeray said the state government is at par with the health infrastructure at the national and international level. He said his government has received permission from the Centre for the use of remdesivir and favipiravin, the antiviral drugs, and they will be made available to people free of cost once the adequate stock has been procured.“We are inaugurating plasma therapy testing centres in Maharashtra on Monday and it will, perhaps, help us in becoming the top state to provide the facility with the highest number of tests for the therapy,” he said.“We appeal to the people who recovered from the infection to come forward for the test of therapy so that other positive patients can be benefited from them,” he said.The chief minister also appealed to doctors from the private sector to come forward and guide their colleagues from the healthcare sector to treat Covid-19 patients effectively.Thackeray reiterated his appeal to the people to keep religious celebrations a low key affair in the wake of the pandemic. He also announced the resumption of the ongoing loan waiver scheme, which was stalled due to the economic crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-says-maharashtra-lockdown-to-continue-hints-at-more-eases-after-june-30/story-IzZSWbbueFS6MKXXuFWS0K.html
28-06-2020||Pune||PMC prepared for the worst: Shekhar Gaikwad, municipal commissioner||According to a projection by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) Smart City Covid-19 war room, Pune will record at least 40,906 progressive Covid-19 cases and 18,408 active cases by July 31. The projection also highlights that PMC will likely witness a shortage of 282 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 172 ventilators by July 31 for critically-ill Covid-19 patients. Shekhar Gaikwad, Pune municipal commissioner, talks to HT about the preparedness to deal with the situation.A projection by Pune Smart city war room says there will be shortage ICU and ventilators in July. How will PMC handle the situation?PMC is well-prepared to handle the worst. Following in the footsteps of Delhi and Mumbai, we are planning in advance. Right now, we have 580 ICU beds out of which 283 are occupied. Total beds with a ventilator are 288 and 63 are occupied. So, considering the growth rate, we are adding the facility step by step. Right now PMC had reserved the 80 per cent beds only in 12 hospitals in the city. If needed, we will reserve more seats in other hospitals. At least 1,000 beds are also ready at the Balewadi sports complex where we have made provision for portable oxygen facility. The price of portable oxygen is very normal and we can provide it in enough numbers as per requirement.Considering the growth rate of Covid-19 positive cases, do we have enough infrastructure?The city’s discharge rate has also increased. As of June 26, 8,633 people have been cured of the virus and discharged from various city hospitals. Even the death rate which was around 9 per cent earlier it has come down to four per cent. According to data as of June 25, PMC had 18,556 beds out of which 5,325 are occupied. Even at the back end, we have identified the infrastructure. For example, at Balewadi sports complex we can increase more beds with oxygen support. Pune’s plus point is that we have a large number of educational institutes which have hostel facilities. Each educational premise has more than 1,000-bed capacity which can be turned into hospitals. What about the medial and paramedical staff?I have already recruited the nurses and doctors on a temporary basis and given them a 45-day appointment. The administration will take approval from the elected members for this recruitment. Pune also has enough private and government hospitals. Recently NCP leader Sharad Pawar and other elected members raised concern over private hospitals charging high fees. Is the administration in talks with the hospitals?There were incidents where citizens were charged extra by private hospitals. PMC, district collector and divisional commissioner are working to resolve the issue and a committee has been formed at district collector level. Even our health department is looking into such complaints. Now the private hospital bills are sent to PMC for reimbursement as under various schemes, the government will bear this cost. There are some complaints that despite negative reports, hospitals are not discharging patients. But it is found that some people due to panic are rushing to private hospitals. Once the patient is admitted, the hospitals are following the Covid-19 protocol and not discharging the patients.How is PMC dealing with the financial burden?We had demanded Rs32 crore from the state, but we have got only Rs2 crore till now. We have spent Rs135 crore till now. We are providing food to at least 5,000 patients admitted at various Covid-19 care centres two times a day. There are additional charges of washing bedsheets and clothes which the civic body is paying for. We have requested the state to give us our Goods and Service Tax component on an urgent basis and some financial help.How is the municipal corporation going to manage its budget given the expenditure on Covid-19 management?We have already formed the finance committee, which I head and other members include the account officer and city engineer. We are calling each department head with the proposed works. We have given instruction to them to undertake only urgent work and postpone the rest. It will help us get control over spending and manage the budget.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-prepared-for-the-worst-shekhar-gaikwad-municipal-commissioner/story-0IZnTx4DUrLHfyPvrGtSiN.html
28-06-2020||Patna||In 15 years, there have been 55 scams in Bihar: Tejashwi Yadav slams Nitish govt||RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on Sunday slammed the Nitish Kumar-led Bihar government and alleged that in the past 15 years there have been 55 scams in the state.“There have been 55 scams that took place in the Bihar government in the past 15 years. No action or inquiry has been undertaken against any official or a political leader by the government. A minimum Rs 3,300 crore of money has been misappropriated in Srijan scam. Who will return the thousands of crores that have been looted from the state,” Yadav asked.“The ‘Chara Ghotala’ (fodder scam) was exaggerated. It was only a Rs 46 lakh scam. But I do not want to say more as the court is doing its work in that,” he added. “Last year when Patna was flooded crores of money was misappropriated by officials of Patna civic body. None of them has been booked. There is a loot of people’s money. Nitish Kumar should inform us what is the action taken to recover the money,” the RJD leader said. With the rains beginning in the state the senior leader also stated that there was a danger of floods affecting the north Bihar areas. “The work of dams has been stopped and the whole of north Bihar is in danger. Due to waterlogging not only Patna, but several other districts in the state are in trouble,” he added. “The roads have been converted into drains. The government should have done pre-monsoon work on drainage. The govt knows that this situation happens in monsoon, but Nitish Kumar’s government did nothing,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/in-15-years-there-have-been-55-scams-in-bihar-tejashwi-yadav-slams-nitish-govt/story-A7JRnJ74nS1qqS7Uv0BJiI.html

28-06-2020||Business||Govt to auction five mineral blocks in Gujarat, Karnataka||The government will beginning Monday auction five mineral blocks in Gujarat and Karnataka having reserves of 667.2 million tonnes.The development assumes significance in the wake of the Centre asking each state having mineral resources to identify at least five new mining projects for auction with pre-embedded clearance on a pilot basis, with a view to expediting the sale process as well as operationalisation of the blocks. While the auction of one mineral block in Karnataka will begin on Monday, the sale of other four mines will commence on Thursday and last till July 8, according to government documents. The notice inviting tender for Kannur (Wadi Area) limestone block in Karnataka was floated in November, while that for four limestone mines in Gujarat was out on March 19. The mines ministry had recently released guidelines for the auction of mineral blocks with pre-embedded clearances as it explored ways to address the key issue of delay in mining production due to lack of various approvals such as forest and environment permissions. The identified blocks would be auctioned along with other blocks without pre-embedded clearances. Under the guidelines, the Centre has asked states to set up a project monitoring unit (PMU) to complete the preparatory work for obtaining requisite clearances, approvals and related work. The unit would obtain all the clearances for starting a mining project. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had earlier announced various structural reforms in the mining sector as part of the over Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package to boost growth and job creation. She had announced auction of 500 blocks and introduction of a seamless composite exploration-cum-mining-cum-production regime. So far, 97 mining leases have been allocated through auctions since 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/govt-to-auction-five-mineral-blocks-in-gujarat-karnataka/story-wRELbeGN5yICsIcmgqFmoJ.html

However, an exact date on reopening was not disclosed. Singh had also said that an official order in this regard was expected to be issued by the Haryana government soon.As per the SOP, the malls can open between 9 am and 8 pm, but cinema halls, gaming arcades, children play areas will continue to remain closed. It also said that all the precautions like social distancing and wearing of masks need to followed by the visitors and mall workers at all times. The SOPs also said that the visitors need to install the Aarogya Setu app. People above the age of 65 and below the age of 10 will not be permitted to visit shopping malls, the SOP stated.Mall authorities will have to ensure that each visitor undergoes thermal scanning and hand-sanitisers are placed at all entry points. They have also been directed to prevent large gatherings or congregations and to ensure that all mall employees who are at high risk, such as senior citizens, pregnant women, and those who have underlying medical conditions, are “preferably” not placed in any front-line work requiring direct interaction with public.Temperature setting of all air-conditioners should be between 24-30 degrees Celsius.The SOP also states that use of escalator with one person on alternate steps should be followed while valet parking can be operational provided the staff is wearing masks and gloves, and steering wheels, door handles, car keys are properly disinfected. The SOPs also lay out guidenlines to be followed is someone tests positive, directing that after placing the person in a “room or area” where they can remain isolated, they must be provided a mask and the owners must immediately inform the closes hospital or clinic, or else “call the state or district helpline”.“A risk assessment will be undertaken by the designated public health authority...and accordingly further action be initiated regarding management of case, his/her contacts and need for disinfection,” the SOP stated, adding that the premises must be disinfected if the person tests positive.Regarding shopkeepers and vendors, the SOP said that apart from ensuring social distancing norms and “preventive measures” are followed, they must ensure “staggering of visitors...to ensure not more than 50% seating capacity at any particular time”. The latter is also applicable for food courts where staff and waiters also have to wear masks and hand gloves. In food courts, the SOP said, seating arrangements must be made so as to ensure social distancing, and “contactless mode of ordering and digital mode of payment” encouraged.The municipalities have been directed to monitor compliance “by undertaking regular visits”, and to check that proper sanitisation is done. They have also been given the power to issue challans of Rs 500 to visitors “not wearing/using face masks”, and of handing over five masks to them.“If any violation of the guidelines issued by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and Government of India are noticed, challans shall be issued against each violation,” the state government order stated.“These directions shall be enforced by the Deputy Commissioners in their respective districts and any violations shall be punishable under the provisions of Disaster Management Act, 2005 as well as under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/malls-to-reopen-in-gurugram-and-faridabad-from-july-1/story-k1JXbhOTVte468EekZaR7H.html
28-06-2020||Education||IIT Delhi, National Chemical Laboratory working on home-based testing kits for COVID-19||Home-based COVID-19 testing kits could soon be a reality with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi and the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) Pune working on an alternative testing method which can not only be performed by individuals at home but will also deliver quick results. The collaborative project with the NCL, which comes under the aegis of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), has also received financial support from Microsoft India and is expected to be ready in a month’s time. According to the team, the project aims to develop an ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunoassay) based diagnostic serological assay against COVID-19. If successful, it will create an economical, commercial process for manufacturing the antigens used in ELISA and home-based diagnostic kits to offer an effective, quick, robust and affordable diagnostic solution to manage the COVID-19 outbreak. “Testing continues to be a challenge in managing COVID-19 and is likely to remain so for the years to come. Currently, Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests detect genetic material to perform coronavirus testing. However, such tests can be performed in laboratories only, require several hours, have low rates of specificity and sensitivity and pose risks related to specimen collection and sample handling,” Anurag S Rathore, Professor, IIT’s Department of Chemical Engineering, told PTI.“Additionally, these tests cannot be performed by individuals at home. These risks can be minimized by developing IgG and IgM based ELISA assays and home-based testing kits,” he added.IgG is the most abundant immunoglobulin to be produced in response to an antigen and is maintained in the body after initial exposure for long term response. IgM is the first immunoglobulin to be produced in response to an antigen and is primarily detected during the early onset of disease.“Coronaviruses are composed of several proteins including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). This assay we propose will utilizes the microplate-based enzyme immunoassay technique,” said Rathore, who is also the institute’s Dean, Corporate Relations. “The technology for purposed ELISA assay for detection of coronavirus and robust and economical expression systems for production of N and S protein antigens can be transferred to national diagnostic centres and private companies specializing in developing home based kits or point-of-care devices, respectively,” he added. While Rathore did not comment on what will be the approximate cost of the test kit, he said, “it will be considerably cheaper than tests being performed now. However, we will have some concrete results in a month’s time and we will be able to analyse only then”.IIT Delhi is the first academic institute in the country to get a nod from the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) for its COVID-19 test kit. The institute has given non-exclusive open licence to Bengaluru-based biotechnology firm Genie Laboratories for commercialising the test, but with a price rider of Rs 500 per kit.The kits are being manufactured at a facility at the Andhra Pradesh MedTech Zone (AMTZ) in Vishakhapatnam, and are expected to be available in the market next month.According to the team, the current testing methods available are “probe-based” while the one developed by the IIT team is a “probe-free” method, which reduces the testing cost without compromising on accuracy.Using comparative sequence analyses, the IITD team identified unique regions (short stretches of RNA sequences) in the COVID-19 and SARS COV-2 genome.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/iit-delhi-national-chemical-laboratory-working-on-home-based-testing-kits-for-covid-19/story-MGsEnXNmdYKV2faz08KwvJ.html

28-06-2020||Lucknow||Monsoon session of UP Assembly may be held through video conferencing: Speaker||The monsoon session of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly could be held in August through video conferencing, its Speaker Hriday Narayan Dixit said on Sunday, but ruled out holding a ‘hybrid session’ on the lines of the British Parliament.He also said the final decision on the issue will be taken by the state government and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. “At present, we are mulling all the possibilities (to hold the monsoon session of the UP Legislature). One possibility is holding the session through video conferencing,” Dixit told PTI on Sunday.“Another option available with us is to hold the session at the Lok Bhavan. There is also the possibility that a section of seats in the upper area of the Vidhan Sabha can be vacated, as it can accommodate 100-125 people (MLAs),” he said.He added that the Lok Bhavan has sufficient space for seating all MLAs.However, the final decision is yet to be arrived at and will be taken by the state government and the chief minister.To a specific question on whether the UP Legislative Assembly may witness a ‘hybrid’ session on the lines of the UK’s Parliament, whereby some MLAs will be physically present in the House and the others will attend the proceedings via video conferencing to ensure social distancing, the 74-year-old Speaker said, “There is no such thought of doing so (aisaa vichaar nahi hai).” In April, the UK Parliament achieved a historic first as the House of Commons held the weekly Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) in a ‘hybrid’ form, with around a dozen lawmakers physically present within the chamber and others tuning in online through giant screens set up to adhere to the social distancing norms in place to curb the spread of coronavirus.A number of MPs logged in through the Zoom application to address their questions in relation to their specific constituencies.Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle had granted an extra 15 minutes to the usual half-hour PMQs session to allow for technical challenges but the hybrid form of the session went ahead without major hurdles.In an earlier interview to PTI (in May), Dixit had said, “At present, the House is not in session. The monsoon session of the UP Legislative Assembly should be held some time in August and I am optimistic that by then the situation would have changed.” He had further said, “If we adhere to social distancing and leave one seat vacant, we will not have enough seats. There are 403 MLAs. Already there are not enough seats for everyone. There is a shortage of 10-12 seats. The work goes on as (generally) 10-12 (members) are absent. In these circumstances, if one seat is left vacant then not more than 200 MLAs will be able to sit”.At present, there are 307 BJP MLAs in the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly followed by the Samajwadi Party which has 48 MLAs. The Bahujan Samaj Party has 18 MLAs, while there are seven Congress MLAs. BJP ally Apna Dal (Sonelal) has nine MLAs and the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party has four MLAs. There are three Independent MLAs, while there is one MLA each from the Rashtriya Lok Dal and the Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Apna Dal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/monsoon-session-of-up-assembly-may-be-held-through-video-conferencing-speaker/story-6c5mOvDvPWnkYfHQoiv85K.html

The man later killed himself, they added.Palghar Superintendent of Police (SP) Dattatray Shinde said the man’s wife left him 45 days ago. He saw the woman’s photo with another man on Facebook and realised that she had eloped with him, Shinde said.The man’s father later confirmed the development and lodged a complaint, the police said.The police said that the man’s father, who lives nearby, first knocked at his son’s door at around 9 pm but thought he and the grandchildren might have gone to sleep without having dinner after he received no response. Two hours later, he again knocked at the door, but there was no response. This time, he broke open the door to find his son and grandchildren dead, the police added.The cops say that the man’s father had called him for tea at around 4.30 pm, but he refused saying his children are asleep which makes them believe that the crime must have taken place around that time.“The complainant informed us and we rushed to the spot, sent the bodies for post-mortem and seized the blood stained knife which was used for the murder. We have registered a case of murder against the deceased and are in search of the victim’s wife who is yet to reach the spot. We are contacting her from the numbers stored on the man’s phone,” said Shinde.He further said that the man must have sedated the children before killing them since neighbours did not hear any screams. The SP also said that the viscera of the four is being sent for chemical analysis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-man-murders-children-later-kills-himself-police/story-ATJf9jJNkoNcjyBudVl1eP.html

28-06-2020||Chandigarh||Five international sportspersons from Punjab promoted as superintendents of police||Arjuna awardee and Commonwealth Games gold medallist shooter Avneet Sidhu, former Indian hockey skipper Rajpal Singh, Olympian discus thrower Harwant Kaur, Asian Games medallists shooter and hockey player Harveen Sarao and Gurbaj Singh, respectively, have been promoted to the rank of superintendent of police in Punjab Police.They are among the 20 police personnel who have been promoted to the rank of SP, according to an office order dated June 27.Avneet is among the batch of the five sportspersons who were recruited directly as DSPs in July 2011 under the sports category. Out of that batch, three international sportspersons, quarter-miler Manjit Kaur, wrestler Palwinder Singh Cheema and hockey player Amandeep Kaur were promoted as SPs last year.Due to Avneet’s sporting commitments, she was not able to complete the mandatory 75-day commando training and phase 2 training by then, so she wasn’t considered for promotion last year. Rajpal, Harwant, Gurbaj and Harveen were recruited under the sports quota in December 2011.“Initially, I had completed the one-year basic and six-month field training, so I was hoping for an exemption in the remaining two trainings because I was doing active shooting. But I was told that relaxation wouldn’t be possible because of police rules. So, I decided to go for the commando and phase 2 trainings. I’m happy that I’ve been promoted. In the coming days, I’ll be getting the posting, but will continue to participate in shooting competitions,” says Avneet, who was with the police sports team till April and was sent to her home unit, 3rd Commando, on Covid duty.International shooters and Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratan awardees Manavjeet Singh Sandhu and Ronjon Sodhi, whose promotions are also due, have not been considered for the next rank as they have yet to complete the mandatory training to become DSPs.SPORTING COUPLES IN PUNJAB POLICEAfter their promotion, Rajpal Singh and Avneet Sidhu are the only sporting couple in the Punjab Police at the rank of SP or above.Rajpal, who led the Indian men’s hockey team to a silver medal finish in the 2010 Commonwealth Games, is posted in Mohali district. Avneet and Rajpal tied the knot in 2013. The other sporting couple in Punjab Police is Arjuna awardee and multi-Asian Games medallist Manjit Kaur and hockey Olympian Gurwinder Singh Chandi. Manjit was recruited in 2011 and was promoted to SP last year, while Chandi, who was a part of the 2014 Asian Games gold medal winning team, was appointed under the sports quota in 2016. They got married in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/five-international-sportspersons-from-punjab-promoted-as-superintendents-of-police/story-QE4dCEpkHyQDzAbGcwk0jM.html

28-06-2020||Business||Business e-mail compromise most common online fraud: Delhi Police||Business e-mail compromise is one of the most common online frauds, a senior Delhi Police officer dealing with cyber-crimes said on Saturday. In a webinar, organised by the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, deputy commissioner of police (Cyber) Anyesh Roy said business e-mail compromise affects more small and medium level enterprises. “The fraudsters do compromise with the email account of the person who is dealing with the company accounts and financial transactions. They create an email account which is similar to either company’s or client’s account. They come in the middle and start interacting with both the parties. They change the destination of financial transactions on some pretext, following which the money goes to the fraudsters’ account,” Roy said. He said a person needs to protect his email account through which financial transaction and invoice are being sent to the clients. “Whenever an instruction has been received from the client about changing the destination of banking account, it needs to be confirmed through alternate means, including phone call, e-mail and other,” the officer said. Roy also said instead of using free e-mail services, the organisations having a large turnover should shift to their own domain and have a properly hosted e-mail service. Another way of cybercrime is ransomware, which is a type of malicious software designed to block access to a computer system until an amount is paid, he said. The backup clouds, locking systems, such as multiple levels of security, can save a person from this kind of fraud, Roy said. “Cyber-crime is like any other crime and one can report it anywhere at any police station or DCP office. The complaint can be registered through e-mail also. Cyber-crimes are happening through digital medium and the evidences can easily be destroyed so the victim needs to capture it as screenshot and give it to police with their complaint,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/business-e-mail-compromise-most-common-online-fraud-delhi-police/story-TodRtTJljQyGJaIccEOiaI.html

During the protest at Behala, some of them claimed that they had quit their job as Zomato has a sizeable Chinese investment and urged people to stop ordering food via the company. In 2018, Ant Financial, part of Chinese major Alibaba, had invested USD 210 million in Zomato for a 14.7-per-cent stake. The food delivery major recently raised an additional $150 million from Ant Financial. “Chinese companies are making profit from here and attacking the Army of our country. They are trying to grab our land. This cannot be allowed,” one of the protesters said.Also read: India deploys air defence systems in eastern Ladakh Another protester said they were ready to starve but would not work in companies having investment from China.

28-06-2020||Mumbai||Students in Maharashtra’s Solapur switch on television to learn daily lessons amid lockdown||Even as several schools in the state are struggling to conduct online learning sessions, students of a school in Solapur only have to switch on their televisions (TV) to get their everyday lessons.Nagesh Karajagi Orchid School, which is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), has begun airing pre-recorded syllabus content on a TV channel to ensure smooth and simple learning process for around 1,500 of its students across all grades.The school closed its operations in March after the state went into lockdown, and began conducting classes for its students online. In a few days however, the school’s teachers realised that face-to-face learning was turning stressful for students and their parents owing to many reasons.“First, they had to get used to the whole online set up. Then, it was a struggle to share devices between siblings and parents, with everyone needing them at the same time. We thus thought of using TV a medium because it has a wider reach and is more accessible,” said Kumar Karajagi, the school’s chairman. The school then hired a team of technicians and trained teachers during May vacations to record videos and this month onwards, teachers started recording classes in a makeshift studio created in the school.“We started calling teachers on a rotational basis a few times a week to record the videos. In the beginning, there were some hiccups in getting used to the system, but the teachers got accustomed to it within a few days,” said Rupali Hajare, principal of the school.As the new academic year of the school commenced on June 9, students saw their teachers on their TV sets for the first time. The school approached a local cable network, which operates across Solapur, to air the recorded content.“They gave us ‘Channel Number 999’ and we gave it our school’s name. The channel airs content from 7am to 7pm. The morning slots are reserved for secondary classes, while the afternoon ones for primary students” said Karajagi.Balasaheb Patil, one of the parents whose two children are enrolled in the school, said the initiative is helping his kids adapt with ease to a new routine.“With dedicated slots for each class, students can learn at the comfort of their homes which is a good thing. They are really happy and look forward to their classes,” said Patil.Over the past few days, students across Solapur, even the ones studying in other schools are using the facility.“Our intention is to make the content available to as many students as possible in these tough times. We are more than happy that so many students are benefiting out of it,” added Karajagi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/students-in-maharashtra-s-solapur-switch-on-television-to-learn-daily-lessons-amid-lockdown/story-0lNZ4ZMCmADUb1XsdCvSTN.html

28-06-2020||Mumbai||From stadium to isolation centre to hospital: A jumbo fight against Covid-19 at Mumbai’s NSCI dome||Once a popular venue for sports and entertainment in the city, the National Sports Club of India’s (NSCI) stadium dome in Worli is now a full-fledged hospital for Covid-19. Since April, it has admitted more than 1,500 patients — including cancer patients, pregnant women, patients with comorbidity — and discharged 1,150 people, boasting of a recovery rate of 76%.In April, NSCI became Mumbai’s first jumbo facility for the treatment of Covid-19. When the outbreak was in its early stages, the Covid centre at NSCI had a 518-bed quarantine centre for asymptomatic Covid-19 patients. Back then, Worli was a Covid-19 hot spot, with infection spreading through the congested locality of the close-knit Worli Koliwada. Later, NSCI was converted into a dedicated Covid health centre (DCHC), with 200 beds equipped with oxygen. A week ago, NSCI was converted into a dedicated Covid-19 hospital (DCH) with 10 modular intensive care units (ICUs) in movable containers as a first phase of an expansion plan, in preparation of a surge in numbers following relaxation of restrictions. It can now treat up to 528 patients.With over 80 staffers — including 25 doctors, 50 nurses, an in-house senior gynaecologist and technicians — living on campus, NSCI is at present treating approximately 300 active Covid-19 patients. Among them are 50 cancer patients, 10 pregnant women and four who are critically-ill. Six intensivists and anaesthetists are being roped in to look after the patients in ICU beds. A surge in cases may pose a challenge to the medical staff.Over the coming week, ICU beds will be scaled up to 37 in two phases. The second phase will add 15 ICU beds in portable containers, and in the third, another 22 ICU beds will be added inside the extension of NSCI’s dome. As a DCH, NSCI also has specialised zones for patients who require oxygen and those with cancer. It has units for families (depending upon availability) and pre-natal and post-natal care zones for pregnant women afflicted with Covid-19. (Pregnant women are shifted to hospitals for deliveries.) Gastro surgeon and dean of the DCH at NSCI, Dr Rajeev Joshi said that since April, the facility has successfully treated 125 cancer patients.ICU units in shipping containers“It was not possible to set up ICUs in a stadium. Every time we had a critical patient, we had to move them to a hospital for an ICU bed. That is when we came up with the idea of ICUs in portable containers. We used shipping containers and converted them to ICUs,” said Dr Muffazal Lakdawala, Mumbai-based surgeon who conceptualised the facility at NSCI alongside Maharashtra’s environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray, who represents the Worli constituency.A garden area within the NSCI compound now houses the ICU facilities. Each shipping container is accommodating two ICU beds, a toilet, and three entry points — one of which is reserved for doctors to maintain the negative pressure inside the container, as doctors are likely to frequent the room. Each ICU is equipped with ventilators, oxygen points, and variable monitoring devices. Before the ICU beds were inaugurated at NSCI last week, about 60 critical patients had to be moved to hospitals because they urgently needed treatment in ICUs.Dr Joshi said, “All four patients on ICU beds at present were being treated at our quarantine facility. Over the past three days, since ICUs became functional, we were able to simply shift patients who required critical care to a unit within our premises. Our focus is to match these ICUs to ICUs in hospitals. “Minimum contact facilityAaditya Thackeray pointed out one of the remarkable achievements of the facility: “Not a single health care professional who started working at NSCI has been infected with Covid-19 over the past four months since the facility became operational [due to minimum exposure].”Dr Joshi explained that NSCI is “a minimum contact facility”. “We are able to optimise the staff we have. Exposure time of doctors to the infection is limited so infection rate in healthcare staff is zero,” he said.There is a no-contact swab collection cubical for doctors to take swab samples from patients for testing. While the doctor stands inside the glass cubicle, which has a separate exit, the patient approaches the cubicle from the other side accessing the cubicle from the quarantine facility. A resident doctor at NSCI who demonstrated the process to Hindustan Times said, “There are two small compartments with glove like extensions that the doctor can put their hands into, and collect the swab.” Similarly, there are diagnostic cubicles with intercom systems for consulting physicians and patients to interact with each other, from either side of a glass partition.Dr Lakdawala said, “This takes away the laborious task of treating Covid-19 patients. When we started the facility in April, we hardly had any doctors. We started with seven doctors and 24 nurses and I didn’t want to infect any of our healthcare professionals. So we conceptualised contact-less treatment. Hazmat suits are very laborious: You sweat, the lenses fog up, and sometimes you cannot talk to the patients at length, so doctors could not properly answer questions asked by these patients. So we came up with the idea of diagnosis cubicles.”There are also two war rooms in NSCI to remotely monitor patients in ICUs and those in the quarantine facility inside the dome. Dr Joshi said, “We can zoom into a patient at the quarantine facility and if we see signs of restlessness or discomfort, the doctors can attend to the patient. The war room for monitoring ICU patients also shows their vital parameters at all times. The healthcare staff is watching the monitors in both war rooms.”With authorities expecting a surge in cases following the next round of relaxations, the facility at NSCI is expected to play an important role in Mumbai’s fight against Covid-19.Delhi government had sought help from BMCThe Delhi government had reached out to the BMC for insight into how they converted stadiums in Mumbai into isolation centres, Covid care facilitiesIqbal Singh Chahal, BMC chief, had said, “Top officers from Delhi have approached me to help them with construction of Mumbai-like jumbo facilities in Delhi.”Maharashtra cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray, who has monitored Mumbai’s Covid-19 bed augmentation plan, had said the city increased its municipal hospital beds from 400 to 5,000 in about a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/from-stadium-to-isolation-centre-to-hospital-a-jumbo-fight-against-covid-19-at-mumbai-s-nsci-dome/story-agZHvipGjZRyXWx5uoNMAI.html
28-06-2020||Chandigarh||How masks have become a money-spinner for Haryana government||With the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, wearing masks has become the new normal, besides an unconventional money-spinner for Haryana government agencies in times of economic slowdown.Since the state government on May 27 ordered imposition of ₹500 penalty for anyone violating the orders to wear masks in public and workplace, it has made good earnings both by way of imposition of penalty on violators and production of masks. The state police, for instance, issued about 37,000 challans between June 5 and June 22 for mask violations, earning a revenue of ₹1.86 crore in the process.The urban local bodies department earned over ₹32 lakh in the past 21 days by penalising over 10,000 violators. “The municipal bodies are also ensuring that every violator penalised is given five masks, preferably made up of cotton cloth, at the time of challaning. This is done to imbibe the habit of wearing masks among citizens since it’s the new normal now,” said a department official.EARNING THROUGH MASK PRODUCTIONWith the state government also encouraging its several institutions to get into cloth mask production to provide source of income to self-help groups (SHGs) and industrial training institutes (ITIs), the mask production business is on a high.About 4,800 SHGs working under the Haryana State Rural Livelihood Mission (HSRLM) are into big-time mask production and have earned a profit of ₹1.37 crore by making about 45 lakh cloth masks. “Our SHGs having about 17,000 members get ₹3 per mask produced as profit,” said a rural development department official. Even the SHGs of with Urban Livelihood Mission have been involved in the mask making activity.The skill development and industrial training department, which runs the industrial training institutes (ITIs) in the state, too has gone into production of cloth face masks.“Our ITIs have produced over 3.45 lakh cloth face masks – both single and double layer. The single layer masks costs ₹10 while the double layer is priced at ₹16. We have already sold masks worth ₹21 lakh and earned a profit of over ₹2 lakh,” said a skill development department official.“Since ITIs run relevant trades like sewing technology, dress making, fashion design technology and computer aided embroidery, the state government decided to start production of face masks in all government ITIs offering the above trades. An honorarium of ₹3 per mask was paid to the trainees and ITI passouts engaged in mask production,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/how-masks-have-become-a-money-spinner-for-haryana-government/story-3q3kmZINLFQC1NPpE3au0L.html

Still, there is nobody to raise the voice of a woman who is insulted at a panchayat meet,” she added. She said the khap leaders, rather than supporting her, acted as mute spectators when she faced character assassination. A video of her had gone viral on social media wherein she could be seen slapping and thrashing Hisar market committee secretary Sultan Singh at a procurement centre earlier this month. On the complaint of Sultan, she was booked and subsequently arrested. Phogat was released on bail the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sonali-phogat-slams-khap-leaders-accuses-them-of-discrimination/story-Jj1DisWvDWIAQgv1EfoN9N.html

28-06-2020||Delhi||Three Khalistani sympathisers planning targeted killings arrested by Delhi Police||The Delhi Police on Saturday busted a module of Sikh separatist group Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) and arrested its three sympathisers who were allegedly planning to execute target killings and extortions in various north Indian states on the directions of Pakistan’s ISI-sponsored Khalistani leaders.Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said at least four persons were on the target list of the arrested men but they could not execute the killings because of the lockdown announced in the country to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).“The three had already procured arms and ammunition to execute the killings on the directions of their handlers who are Khalistani militants living abroad and sponsored by the Pak spy agency ISI. The lockdown had also foiled their plan to cross over to Pakistan for terrorist training,” said DCP Yadav.The three men, identified as Mohinder Pal Singh, 29, Gurtej Singh, 41, and Lovepreet Singh, 21, were arrested from Delhi, Punjab and Haryana in separate operations by the city police’s anti-terror squad, special cell, in the last 10 days. Police said three pistols and seven cartridges were seized from them. Three smartphones, including an iPhone, containing many incriminating videos and photographs related to Khalistani movement and their propagators were also seized, the police said.Yadav said that Gurtej, the son of a subedar in the Indian Army, was in touch with an ISI handler, Abdullah, apart from having contacts with Avtar Singh Pannu of Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), a pro-Khalistan group banned by the Indian government, and Gopal Singh Chawla, who is based in Pakistan and is a close aide of Hafiz Saeed, co-founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).“Abdullah had asked Gurtej to recruits like-minded people and send them to Pakistan for terrorist training. Gurtej recruited five men, including Lovepreet, who has been arrested along with him. He was also planning to extort Rs 10 lakh from two businessmen for arranging more weapons and logistics,” the DCP said.The DCP said that Mohinder originally belongs to Baramulla in Jammu and Kashmir but had moved to Delhi in 2007 for studies. In 2013, he began developing orientation towards Khalistan movement and started attending Delhi court hearings of Jagrat Singh Hawara, a Babbar Khalsa militant convicted for assassinating former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh. He came in touch with other sympathisers of the KLF and started working for the outfit, said Yadav.During interrogation, DCP Yadav said, Lovepreet, who worked at a computer repair shop, revealed that he developed an inclination towards Khalistan movement three-four years ago and was recruited by Gurtej, who promised to send him to Pakistan for weapon training.“Lovepreet is active on social media and using the platforms to remain in touch with Khalistani militants settled abroad. He also used to upload incriminating posts, videos, images and songs supporting Khalistan movement and its leaders,” the DCP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-khalistani-sympathisers-planning-targeted-killings-arrested-by-delhi-police/story-ut5RXU2WunVIsWeIuGBUqM.html
28-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Smart City Limited receives responses from 14 firms keen on upgrading city’s 5 STPs||Chandigarh Smart City Ltd (CSCL) has finally received a positive response from firms willing to upgrade the five sewage treatment plants (STP) in the city and the work is all set to start in two months’ time.CSCL had failed to elicit any response in its previous attempts at floating tenders for the project. This time, however, a total of 14 companies have applied for three different tenders and the department is hopeful that within the next two months, work will be allotted.The Chandigarh municipal corporation has already been warned by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that if the plants are not upgraded, they will face a penalty.The CSCL will bear the principal cost of the upgrading of the five STPs that comes to around ₹300 crore. The MC will operate and maintain these units for 15 years at an estimated maintenance cost of around ₹527 crore, which includes ₹289.36 crore electricity charges.PROJECT DIVIDED INTO THREE WORKSThe upgrading of five STPs was divided into three different tenders instead of just one tender for all to encourage more firms to apply. For the STP in Diggian, Mohali, which is the biggest among all five, a separate tender was floated and four firms have responded to it. Seven firms have applied for the upgrading of STPs at Raipur Kalan and Raipur Khurd; and three have applied for the Dhanas and 3BRD plants.“We are in the process of vetting these tenders. The work will be allotted within two months, and by the end of the August work can be expected to start,” said an MC official, adding that it is likely to take another 24 months for the upgrading work to be completed.WHY UPGRADE STPsThe effluent discharge from four of the five STPs into Ghaggar river’s tributaries has lately shown much higher biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) levels than the latest permissible levels of 10mg/litre.BOD is the amount of dissolved oxygen needed by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at a certain temperature over a specific time period. A low BOD is an indicator of good quality water, while a high BOD indicates pollution.Apart from polluting the Ghaggar, higher BOD level is affecting the quality of treated water that the MC is releasing towards irrigation of public and private parks. Due to this, treated water stinks and is used less by private households.None of the STPs in Chandigarh have the requisite machinery to deal with faecal coliform, a type of disease causing pathogen and major water pollutant, the most probable number (MPN) value for which needs to be contained below 230 MPN/100. Water pollution caused by faecal contamination is a serious problem due to the potential for contracting diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-smart-city-limited-receives-responses-from-14-firms-keen-on-upgrading-city-s-5-stps/story-jegduKj3sVaC80C2YhqqnK.html

28-06-2020||City||Mumbai civic body to ramp up antibody and antigen testing from next week||After facing severe criticism over inadequate testing for almost four months, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is set to expand the screening for Covid-19 through antibody and rapid antigen testing.Starting Monday, the civic body will commence large-scale sero-surveillance to diagnose individuals for antibodies of Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, and monitor the spread of the virus. The survey will be conducted in three wards — M West (Tilak Nagar and Chembur), F North (Matunga, Sion and Wadala) and R North (Dahisar and Mandapeshwar). During sero-surveillance, residents will undergo blood tests that can detect the presence of IgG antibodies, which develop against Sars-CoV-2. Sero-surveillance mostly helps in identifying asymptomatic patients. A total of 10,000 blood samples of patients above 12 years of age will be randomly collected from areas in the three civic wards. “Through this, we will be able to understand the geographical spread of the infection among the population. Our health workers and NGOs will carry house-to-house surveys to collect blood,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer, BMC. “With a better understanding on the spread of the virus, we will be able to formulate further policies.”Meanwhile, BMC also decided to increase daily rapid antigen tests by 2,000 from the current 4,000-5,000 tests, which has shown a case positivity rate of 22%. For the purpose, BMC is in the process of procuring around 1 lakh rapid testing kits from South Korean firm SD Biosensors – the only company approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Rapid antigen tests detect the presence of molecular pathogens of Sars-Cov-2. The test results are out within 30 minutes, as against eight hours through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test that is being used currently. Thus, the procedure will help in early detection of symptomatic patients. According to protocol, every positive report from the rapid antigen testing will be treated as ‘true positive’, while negative samples will have to be mandatorily re-tested by RT-PCR process.“We have over 20,000 suspected patients in government quarantine facilities. With rapid testing, we will be able to identify them faster, which will help in early treatment, faster contact tracing and vacating of beds,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a part of the state Covid-19 task force.When asked if testing samples twice will increase the burden on RT-PCR labs, Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC, said, “Since we will mostly test high-risk contacts after five days of getting exposed to the virus, the possibility of finding more positive cases are higher than negative samples and therefore the burden on labs will be less.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-civic-body-to-ramp-up-antibody-and-antigen-testing-from-next-week/story-4VA9h8anNx1iOKoTrIOxMP.html
28-06-2020||Mumbai||Why were facts on allowing students with 60% attendance to take exams not disclosed: Bombay HC to Mithibai College||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed Mithibai College to explain why the facts pertaining to allowing students with 60% attendance to appear for the semester 4 exams were not disclosed to the court in its affidavit filed on June 18. The institute had filed the affidavit in response to a petition of a student with 58.9% attendance.The student had sought directions to the college to declare her eligible for the exams, as the institute had allowed students with 60%, through a March 6 decision, to appear for exams and also promoted them. As the college had failed to disclose the fact in its affidavit, the court said it was granting time to the institute to take adequate steps.A division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice NR Borkar, while hearing a petition filed by the student through video conferencing on Friday, was informed by advocate Harshad Bhadbhade, that though the rules had stipulated 75% overall attendance, the college had permitted students with 60% attendance to appear for the exams. Bhadbhade submitted that his client had an attendance of 58.9% and hence she should also be treated on the same lines as students with 60%.When the court asked the college why the fact that studnets with 60% attendance could appear for exams had not been disclosed in the June 18 affidavit, institute principal Rajpal Hande was unable to justify the reason.The June 18 affidavit had stated, “Student/s who secure less than 75% of attendance had to take re-admission in the same semester in the subsequent academic year”. The affidavit signed by Hande had also denied that the college had permitted, “….. students having attendance of 59% to appear in the examination as allegedly stated …… or at all”.However, in the written submissions filed by the college on June 25, it admitted that students with 60% attendance had been allowed to appear for the exams and promoted too. On being questioned when the decision was taken, Hande said that it was taken on March 6.In light of these submissions, Kathawalla questioned as to why the March 6 decision was not mentioned in the June 18 affidavit, to which the college submitted that it had been missed out as instructions while preparing the affidavit were given on telephone. Kathawalla observed, “There is no question of any fact being left out because of the alleged telephonic instructions, because statements are made in the said affidavit which are completely contrary to the facts now disclosed, and in any event the principal has signed every page of the said affidavit.”The bench further observed, “Keeping in view that the matter involves serious issues pertaining to attendance discipline, which the college wants to assert, and also as the same involves the future of several students, we are granting time to the college to take adequate steps in the matter.” The petition has been posted for hearing on June Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/why-were-facts-on-allowing-students-with-60-attendance-to-take-exams-not-disclosed-bombay-hc-to-mithibai-college/story-uEOFibMwXqNqfNJf7gM6JP.html

Investigation by the Ludhiana Police found a combination of depression, domestic violence, financial worries and reduced access to healthcare as the primary causes to the spike.Of the total 137 suicides this year, while 61, including 15 by women, were reported between January 1 and March 31; following the Covid-19 lockdown, another 76 such deaths came to the fore through April to June. The latter comprised 54 males and 22 females, most of them victims of domestic violence.Among the lockdown suicides were 44 by people suffering from depression, including a girl as young as nine years old and a man as old as 80 years old. A majority of these persons were those who had lost their jobs during the pandemic. The nine-year-old girl had killed herself in Dhandhran Enclave on May 16. According to her parents, she was disturbed after a spat with her brother over playing games on a mobile phone.Domestic violence was the second major reason behind suicides during the lockdown. In 16 cases out of the total 76, police found domestic violence behind women taking the extreme step. They were aged between 19 and 40 years. The number of suicides before March 31 due to domestic violence was seven.Financial problems drove five people to suicide, all aged between 32 and 40 years. Among them, a private school employee ended his life while talking to his wife over a video call on May 14. The man, who was a resident of Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar, worked as a computer operator with a private school. He was depressed due to Rs 2 lakh that he owed someone.Prior to the lockdown, seven people, aged between 20 and 36 years, had ended their lives due to poor finances. Police also found out that a 40-year-old debt-ridden man killed himself on April 1, while no such cases were reported before the lockdown.Buried under the stress of studies, five persons, aged between 17 and 25 years, also died by suicide, while four persons killed themselves following failing health. They were between 42 to 45 years old. Poor health had driven eight people to suicide before the lockdown.Deputy commissioner of police (DCP, headquarters) Akhil Chaudhary said work-life imbalance and the paradox between expectation and reality led to suicidal tendencies. “The police try to investigate all suicide cases reported in the city to establish the reason behind the victims taking the extreme step,” he said.“The pandemic-induced lockdown was difficult for people from all walks of life, but especially for those who lost their sources of income. The lockdown affected people from all age groups, whether psychologically, emotionally, physically or financially,” said Dr Nidhi Aggarwal, assistant professor, Christian Medical College and Hospital.HELPLINESIf you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

She is among the 148 girl students of ITIs across the state, who have each made more than 1,000 four-layered washable masks from their homes, readying over 2.3 lakh masks during this period. In all, more than 15 lakh masks have been stitched by 4,600 students with the support of their teachers and principals.To honour the efforts of the students and 13 principals of ITIs, the state government will acknowledge them with appreciation letters on Monday. “It is important to recognise the efforts put in by these students and principals. The students have contributed to this cause by stitching masks and principals went out of their way to collect raw material through donations and deliver it at students’ home. They also collect the masks and distribute them among frontline Covid warriors,” said Anurag Verma, principal secretary, technical education and industrial training, Punjab. “The appreciation certificates will be given to the ITI principals at our Chandigarh office. The principals will further hand these over to the 148 students. We will also hold a meeting with the students through video conference to appreciate them and share their experience,” he added. Additional secretary (directorate of technical education and industrial training) Daljit Kaur Sidhu, said, “Students who stitched more than 1,000 masks will be acknowledged with appreciation letters. Besides, we selected principals from ITIs where students stitched 25,000 or more masks with their efforts.”TOP 3 STUDENTS WITH MOST MASKSTwenty nine-year-old Pawan Kaur, who stays in a joint family, said she prefers stitching masks early morning and late night.“I learnt the technique though YouTube, and with practice, I am able to stitch one mask in five minutes. While the ITI teachers deliver the cloth at home, my mother-in-law motivates me to contribute to the noble cause,” she said.“Since childhood, I was fond of sewing and decided to pursue a course in tailoring. It will be an honour to receive the appreciation letter from the Punjab government,” said Kaur, who hails from Baba Bagla Sahib village in Amritsar.Kanwaljeet Kaur, a student of ITI Women, Rajpura, Patiala, who stitched 3,748 masks also figures in the Top 3 students with maximum masks.

28-06-2020||Mumbai||Trump’s visa order: Indian families separated, suffer, seek to be reunited||A father separated from his wife and child. A mother whose children keep begging her to come home. A young man’s life altered, perhaps forever. All the result of an announcement that has slammed the gates shut on people who had legally been working, paying taxes and building their lives, for years, in the United States (US).On June 22, US President Donald Trump’s administration announced that it was suspending a range of visas — including the L-1A, L-1B, J-1, the popular H1-B issued to skilled workers and the H-4 issues to dependents. Any individuals that didn’t already have a valid visa stamp by June 24 would not be allowed back into that country — except perhaps as tourists — until at least December 31.Some of the people you’ll read about here have H-4 petitions approved till 2022. But every time you leave the US, you still have to refresh the stamp at a consulate. Without a fresh stamp, you cannot re-enter the United States. And as things currently stand, no fresh stamps will be issued this year.What’s made this crisis even worse: US consulates in India have been shut since mid-March, because of coronavirus restrictions. So, people who had rushed here to be with a dying mother, to spend time with family, or precisely to refresh the stamp — have all got locked in to a norm that didn’t even exist when they left their lives in America. Here are some of their stories.A TICKING CLOCKChanakya R is 13 weeks late to work, and it’s looking more and more like he may not make it there at all.The sales consultant flew to Mumbai from San Francisco on February 29, to refresh his visa stamp because he was changing jobs in the US. “I thought I’d meet family and friends, get the visa stamp done by end-March and head back,” says the 30-year-old. His timing couldn’t have been worse. “By mid-March, the embassies shut because of the coronavirus restrictions. With Indian borders also sealed, international flights suspended, and no H1-B stamp in my passport, I got in touch with my employer and asked for an extension on my joining date.” As soon as the embassies opened and flights were operational, he promised them, he would return. Now that seems impossible too.June 24 has come and gone, and he still has no fresh H1-B stamp. Chanakya’s only hope of returning to what has been his life for seven years, is if the decision is reversed. “I am hopeful that the ban will be lifted soon,” he says, speaking from Bengaluru, where he is living with family. He is trying to stay calm and positive. He says he spends his time reading and connecting with family and friends. But it’s hard not to dwell on it, he admits, hard not to think of how the course of his life may be permanently altered.‘SHE MISSES HER DAD’“It breaks my heart to see her crying on video calls with her father, as he tries to explain to her why he didn’t take us with him,” says Sraboni Bose, 32.Bose and her five-year-old daughter came to India from Plano, Texas, in mid-February, to visit family. Her husband, a software engineer and H1-B visa holder, joined them on March 10.Soon after he arrived, on March 16, consulates shut due to coronavirus restrictions. While Bose and her husband had their renewed H1-B and H-4 stamps by then, their daughter’s passport was still with the consulate, pending an interview.On May 12, Bose’s husband had to return to work or risk losing his job in the US, so he took a seat on a Vande Bharat flight headed to the US to bring Indians home. The consulates were still closed. As soon as things reopened, they figured, they would get the fresh H-4 stamp for their daughter, and be together again.Then came the Trump order. For this family, it means that Bose’s daughter can’t return to her home of three years, can’t return to school. And she and her mother will be separated from her dad until at least the end of the year. “My family suffers due to this unfair proclamation,” says Bose, currently living with her parents in Kolkata. “I don’t have a work permit; my child is doing nothing to affect the US economy. So why this separation? It is taking a toll on our mental health. I quit a well-paid job as an IT engineer so that I could follow my husband to the US, and my child could grow up with both parents. All we want is to be reunited.”LOSS AFTER LOSSOn March 12, Jyoti Patil rushed to Karnataka from the US to be with her mother, who was critically ill. She came alone from San Jose, California, her home of six years, leaving her 11-year-old son and six-year old daughter with her husband, Anand Patil, a software engineer. On March 20, Patil’s mother died. Amid the emotional upheaval of dealing with this loss, with neither husband nor children around to comfort her, Patil now had to worry about not being allowed back to the US to be with them. “I completely froze upon hearing the order on March 22,” says Patil, 40, now living with her in-laws. “Even if I had wanted to get the renewed stamp while my mother was critically ill, I couldn’t have. The consulates were already closed. We are legal, law-abiding aliens. I have an approved H-4 petition valid till 2022. We have set up lives there with a lot of effort and investment. I do not understand how a non-working H-4 dependent visa holder can impact the jobs of the American people.”Anand, meanwhile, is struggling to juggle a full-time job and kids who are home all day because schools are shut. “He’s working long hours at night to make up for the time lost during the day. I fear for his health. My daughter keeps asking me to come home, I look at them on my phone screen and I can see them suffering.

28-06-2020||Chandigarh||Bars in Chandigarh turn into restaurants, cafes to stay afloat||While waiting for the UT administration to decide on June 30 whether alcohol should be served in hospitality establishments, a few bars still open in the city have started rebuilding their image as cafes and restaurants in order to make up for the losses incurred during the lockdown.Director of Social, a bar and restaurant in Sector 7, Manish Goel, said, “During the day, Social used to be more like a cafe than a bar, and we are trying to reinstate that image. We have started receiving regular [customers] who come for the food.”Though there was barely anyone present in Social on Saturday afternoon, Goel’s other outlet, Swagath, in Sector 26 hasn’t been as affected because of food being its “USP”, he said.Meanwhile in Elante Mall, bars have remained closed so far owing to some disagreement over rent. But Pyramid will be open from Monday onwards for both dine-in and delivery of food. Proprietor Sunveer Sondhi said, “It will be different operating Pyramid as a restaurant, but we are hopeful that the administration will allow us to serve alcohol after June 30. That’s why we have restarted the business.”“However, if the same movement restrictions as in Mohali are applied to the city, it will affect us adversely,” added Sondhi, who has developed an app for ordering food at his bar to abolish interaction between customers and staff. MAKE YOUR OWN BARSome outlets are providing the vibe of a bar at the customers’ homes. Gaah, a city-based entertainment company, which runs Upstairs Club in Sector 5, Panchkula, has started a home delivery of cocktail premixes.Co-founder of Gaah, Karan Bajaj, said, “It has been a week since we started the service and so far, we’ve sold over 250 drink mixes. Even after bars are allowed to open, we will continue to provide the product as people will be reluctant to step out. We are also collating playlists on Spotify for our customers to recreate the bar experience at their homes.”Even if the administration gives the green signal on June 30, it could take microbreweries several weeks to restart operations and reopen. Manager of the Great Bear Kitchen and Microbrewery in Sector 26, Debdip Chaterjee, said, “We have been closed for around three months now and all our staff is out of the city. It will take us some time to bring them back. Brewing beer takes around three weeks and we will have to start from scratch.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bars-in-chandigarh-turn-into-restaurants-cafes-to-stay-afloat/story-1fyOHFCLuDq5YUhrAynslJ.html
28-06-2020||Chandigarh||543 fresh infections take Haryana tally to 13,427||Seven coronavirus patients in Haryana died on Saturday, taking the state’s death toll to 218. Among those who succumbed to the virus were two Gurugram residents and one each from Faridabad, Rewari, Jhajjar, Sonepat and Karnal. As per a medical bulletin, 543 fresh cases were reported on Saturday from 15 districts, pushing the cumulative number of positive cases past 13,000. The number of active cases stood at 4,737. Seven districts — Ambala, Palwal, Hisar, Kurukshetra, Jind, Kaithal and Charkhi Dadri — did not report any fresh cases, the bulletin mentioned. On Saturday, 456 patients recovered from the respiratory illness, taking the total number of those cured to 8,472.

Financial constraints and economic distress during the lockdown period coupled with a huge backlog has led to a higher than usual number of these cases, which fall under the Negotiable Instruments Act.According to information available with the courts, around 100 cheque bounce cases are being filed every day since June 12 when the courts opened after almost three months since they were shut due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The cases are filed under the non-urgent category. Before the lockdown, the monthly average of cheque bounce cases was 1,500. At the current rate, this average has doubled.Already, 21% of all the pending cases in district courts pertain to cheque bounce cases. Prior to the lockdown, as many as five judicial magistrates were handling as many as 28,000 such cases. Each of the five judicial magistrate first class (JM1C) has a pendency of cases ranging from 4,100 to 6,500.Advocate Gagan Anand, who has filed a number of cheque bounce cases on behalf of his clients, said the legal notices, which are a mandatory requirement before a case is filed in court, warrants a reply to be filed in 15 days under the Act. “As soon as post offices opened during the lockdown, a lot many legal notices were sent to those whose cheques that were dishonoured by banks for ‘insufficient funds’. As soon as the 15-day notice period expired, the litigants were waiting for courts to open to file the cases thus the huge number,” he said.Anand further said that with people suffering losses during lockdown, these cases have risen.A majority of these cases are that of default in repayments in loans given to acquaintances, a sizeable number have been filed by banks and other financial firms. In a large number of commercial transactions, cheques are issued as a device to defraud the creditors.In one such case filed yesterday, an auto parts trader accused a buyer of dishonouring two cheques amounting to Rs 1.2 lakh towards release of his payment. According to Upkar Singh Ahuja, chairman, Chamber of Commercial and Industrial Undertaking, the industry is currently facing a lot of financial troubles which is why such disputes are on the rise. “Financial disputes are rising ever since the lockdown. People are not able to honour payments and there is lot of upheaval in the industry currently,” says Ahuja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-effect-ludhiana-district-courts-witness-spike-in-cheque-bounce-cases/story-HUwAOxslusr8QOsBa9RX9I.html
28-06-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana govt to charge interest from arhityas for delaying wheat payment||The Haryana government has decided to charge interest from commission agents for not depositing the wheat payment in the account of farmers on time.According to the information obtained from the Haryana agriculture marketing board, the department had identified 13,610 commission agents in the state, who did not make payments of farmers within 72 hours. They will now be asked to pay Rs 28 crore as interest to about 1.87 lakh farmers. As per officials, the government has prepared a district-wise list of such arhtiyas. “We have provided the data of commission agents who did not deposit payment in the accounts of farmers as per the schedule,” said Sumedha Kataria, chief administrator, state agriculture marketing board.Additional chief secretary (ACS) food, civil supplies and consumer affairs, PK Das, said, “Notices will be issued to the commission agents if they fail to pay the interest amount to the farmers. Then, the money will be recovered from their commission amount.” Officials in the state food and supplies department said the government has made this decision to fulfil its commitment to farmers wherein it had promised that they would get their payments within 72 hours.“If the commission agents do not deposit the interest amount in the accounts of farmers, they may face action, which includes blacklisting or cancellation of their licence,” one of the officials said. However, commission agents have claimed that the payments were not delayed by them, but the government. It was the government which delayed the payments of farmers by 15 to 20 days due to online transactions, they alleged. “We will approach the government and ask it to also pay interest to the commission agents as well as farmers as the payments were delayed by 10 to 20 days due to the new online payment system initiated by the government,” said Vikash Singhal, secretary of Haryana State Anaj Mandi Arhtiya Association. As per the figures provided by the food and supplies department, the state government had procured 78 lakh MT wheat at the minimum support price of Rs 1,925. Following the directions of the Centre, the Haryana government had taken an initiative to make online payments to commission agents and they were told to further pay the farmers within 72 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-govt-to-charge-interest-from-arhityas-for-delaying-wheat-payment/story-ZZyq8yhrtKxVW5xemvzJ0I.html
28-06-2020||City||Finish enquiry against suspended DIG by July 9, tribunal tells state||The Maharashtra administrative tribunal (MAT) has ordered the state home department to complete the departmental enquiry against suspended deputy inspector general (DIG) Nishikant More, who was booked for allegedly molesting a minor girl in Navi Mumbai. More had approached the MAT challenging his suspension as the enquiry was not completed within the stipulated 90 days’ time.In December 2019, Taloja police had booked More under sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act following the complaint of a 17-year-old girl’s father. The father had alleged that More touched the girl inappropriately while feeding her birthday cake at a party.More was posted as a DIG at the motor transport department in Pune when, on January 9, he was suspended as per the state government’s order. The Bombay high court (HC) had granted More anticipatory bail in January.On March 10, More wrote to the government seeking “revocation of suspension and reinstatement in service on the ground of protracted and prolonged suspension without initiating the department enquiry”.More’s counsel KR Jagdale applied to the tribunal, stating that he is eligible for reinstatement as the enquiry has not been completed within 90 days.Advocate Kranti Gaikwad, representing the state home department, told the tribunal, “The process to place the matter before the review committee is underway.”The tribunal coram, taking note of a previous judgment by the Supreme Court, held that “…if the memorandum of charges/charge-sheet is served, in that event, the disciplinary authority is under obligation to pass reasoned order about the extension or revocation of suspension.”The tribunal also asked the department to review the suspension and pass an order by July 9.Case filed against girl’s familyMore and the girl’s families were acquainted until they got into a property dispute. Weeks after the molestation case was registered against More, the girl on January 8, went ‘missing’, leaving behind a ‘suicide note’ naming the DIG for her death.She was traced to Dehradun a week later with her 20-year-old boyfriend, and they were brought back to the city. On their return, Taloja police arrested her boyfriend under sections of the Pocso Act, for sexual assault.Later in February, Kharghar police booked the girl, her parents, brother, and her boyfriend under charges of criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly, rioting, defamation, and assaulting a public servant under sections of the IPC and rarely-used Police (Incitement to Disaffection) Act, 1922.The Kharghar case was registered based on a December 21, 2019, incident wherein the girl’s family and her boyfriend surrounded More’s driver Rakesh Gaikwad, claiming that she had been kidnapped by More. It was found during the investigation that the girl was in touch with her father and was also present nearby, a police source said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/finish-enquiry-against-suspended-dig-by-july-9-tribunal-tells-state/story-6eMZFGmepJo9b4VpIp0O5K.html
28-06-2020||Chandigarh||Admn prioritises institutional quarantine rather than sealing off areas in Chandigarh||As the coronavirus spreads to congested areas in the city, the UT administration has decided to shift its approach from sealing those areas to banking upon institutional quarantine for contacts of positive patients.Recently in Mauli Jagran, 14 members of a family and their two community contacts were found infected after which 80-odd contacts living in the vicinity were institutionally quarantined rather than sealing off the area.Explaining the reason, UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta said, “In sectors, the policy for perimeter control of large areas has been restricted to the houses from where a positive case is reported. While in congested areas where social distancing is difficult to ensure, the idea is to implement institutional quarantine. In some cases both perimeter control and quarantine maybe executed.”“Earlier, even a single case would create hue and cry and we would seal the entire area. The basic purpose was to stop the spread,” Gupta added.PROTESTS IN CONTAINMENT ZONESThe move comes in the aftermath of protests by residents of many containment zones of the city. The locals had complained of stigmatisation in social and professional spheres owing to the tag of ‘containment zone’. UT adviser Manoj Parida said that the new strategy was more effective and balanced containment of spread as well as residents’ convenience. “This strategy is less hard on people living near positive cases, while we focus on checking on each contact. The people are being provided better services in institutional quarantine and chances of infection spread decreases here,” he said.Deputy commissioner of Chandigarh Mandip Singh Brar said the city had the facility for institutional quarantine of around 1,300 people in schools, PU hostels and other government buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/admn-prioritises-institutional-quarantine-rather-than-sealing-off-areas-in-chandigarh/story-zQrGZiMKmHUQoaFHg22O6I.html

28-06-2020||Mumbai||Sahyadri Tiger Reserve used by 8 tigers: Forest department||The Maharashtra forest department said the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve (STR) was being frequently used by eight tigers. Nestled in the rugged terrains (350m-1,250m altitude gradient) of northern Western Ghats, STR spread over 1,166 square kilometre (sqkm) area is western Maharashtra’s only tiger reserve, comprising Chandoli National Park and Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary. It was declared a tiger reserve in 2008. V Clement Ben, chief conservator of forest, Kolhapur and former field director of STR said, “Based on secondary data collection including scat analysis and model-based predictions for prey base per square km, we have identified the presence of eight tigers in STR. While the number is more than what the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had assessed in 2014 (five-seven tigers), this is not a resident tiger population. These are dispersing tigers but the data indicates habitat improvement and increase in prey base, thus allowing more tigers to move through this landscape.”The details were shared by Ben after a research paper was published on Saturday in CATnews, a newsletter which is a component of the Species Survival Commission of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). While camera trap images of the tiger were captured in May 2018, the research paper jointly conceived by the state forest department and Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun was published after 25 months.“STR is suitable to carry the capacity of resident wild tigers akin to tiger reserves in Vidarbha,” said Ben, a contributing author of the paper. He added, “This ecosystem can now sustain wild tiger population if translocation is experimented.”WII scientists said there was a fear that tigers had become functionally extinct in this region since there were no photographic records since 2011. “Even though there are no resident tigers in STR currently, the one documented four times in camera trap images (May 22-24, 2018) had also dispersed through this region,” said Ramesh Krishnamoorthy, corresponding author of the paper and principal investigator, WII. He added, “Conservation efforts have led to an improvement in prey population, reduced human disturbances, and enhanced protection of fragmented forests.”Currently, the data indicates the nine animals (wild boar, deer etc.) per sqkm. “It needs to be at least 15 or 16 to have a healthy resident population,” said Ben.The findings of the research paper were part of the 10-year-monitoring and habitat development exercise of STR which started in 2016. A review of experimental tiger translocation would be taken later this year. “It can commence by releasing one male and one female,” added Krishnamoorthy.The narrow boundaries of the reserve have fragmented forest cover owing to human habitation in the buffer as well as core areas. The reserve has dense and open forests, scrublands, barren areas, water bodies, and agricultural lands making it a unique ecosystem. “Now, our attempt is to have social acceptance from villagers to be relocated from the core STR areas, and concentrate on habitat development to increase tiger presence,” said Krishnamoorthy who welcomed the forest department’s latest decision to declare the 29.53 sqkm area in Dodamarg, Sindhudurg as Tillari Conservation Reserve. “The protected area will act as a stepping stone for tiger source population from sanctuaries in Goa and Karnataka. We must also realise that while developing a conducive environment for more tigers at STR, protecting the entire Sahyadri range is crucial for the water security and recharge capacity for western Maharashtra,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sahyadri-tiger-reserve-used-by-8-tigers-forest-department/story-1tb5ee0QqYOpm1jjjj6rhM.html
28-06-2020||Mumbai||‘Beach shacks may cause harm to turtle nesting sites’||Two days after the state cabinet cleared a proposal to enhance tourism by setting up shacks at eight beaches across four coastal districts in Maharashtra, the move has drawn criticism from environmentalists and marine biologists.Mumbai-based environment research agency TerraNero Environment Solutions wrote to environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray on Saturday, saying enhanced tourism would come with increased risk of harmful plastic and glass (in the form of alcohol bottles) being dumped at Olive Ridley turtle nesting sites. Marine biologists and turtle conservationists said the decision may destroy nesting sites completely.“We must ask the state whether enhanced tourism is worth the risk to which our precious and already-threatened biodiversity will be exposed to. Eco-tourism is a middle path between nature and recreation, but it is also a tightrope walk which can lead to irreversible damages,” said Deepti Sharma, founder and director, TerraNero. On Thursday, the cabinet approved setting up a maximum of 10 shacks of the permitted size (15ftx15ft with a 20ftx15ft shade in front) across Kelwa and Bordi in Palghar; Varsoli and Diveagar in Raigad; Guhagar and Aareware in Ratnagiri; and Kunakeshwar and Tarkarli in Sindhudurg. An official government resolution for the policy is yet to be published.“Guhagar has been witnessing some of the highest Olive Ridley turtle nests along Maharashtra with 40 nests in 2019 and 28 this year while Diveagar has been witnessing seven to eight nests every year. A spurt in sporadic turtle nesting across various sandy beaches along Konkan is being observed but the present proposal will change this,” said turtle conservationist Mohan Upadhyay.A 2012 study by the College of Fisheries, Ratnagiri, had highlighted how Kunkeshwar and Tarkarli in Sindhudurg used to be turtle nesting sites until tourism increased. “Once the combined effect of noise pollution due to water sports and high tourist footfall happened, turtles stopped nesting on these sandy beaches completely,” said one of the authors requesting anonymity.Sanjai Jalla, from the Society of Integrated Coastal Management (SICOM) under the Union environment ministry and mission leader for the Blue Flag certification (international standards for beaches), said, “If turtle nesting sites have been declared as ecologically sensitive areas (ESAs), then introducing beach shacks could be dangerous. But if there is no such tag, then the state would have taken due cognisance of such issues.”Marine biologist Deepak Apte said, “Some of these beaches, especially from Raigad to Sindhudurg, are ESAs but they have not been notified on paper. Any such tourism, allowing inclusion of alcohol, will not only destroy the habitat but also the culture of these beaches.”A senior official from the tourism department said, “During the proposal stage itself, we had consulted various stakeholders, including the forest department, for suggestions to ensure local ecology would not be affected. Those suggestions have been made part of the policy. Additionally, all activities would be undertaken only after receiving consent from the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority.”HT had reported TerraNero’s study in January this year that alcohol and expired medicine bottles account for almost three-fourth of the total waste littered across Velas, Anjarle and Kelshi beaches (recognised specially for turtle nesting). “We fear a much worse scenario for these selected beaches,” said Sharma. “We must underscore the importance of keeping our beaches cleaner and safer for species who are dependent on them for their feeding and reproduction.”RATNAGIRI LOCALS HAD REJECTED BEACH SHACK PROPOSAL IN 2009A similar proposal by Maharashtra Tourism and Development Corporation (MTDC) was rejected by Ratnagiri locals in 2009, said Upadhyay. “We had highlighted the threat to turtles and had rejected the plan. On one hand, only sandy beaches have been selected where sporadic incidents of turtle nests are observed while some of these beaches already have homestays. These homestays should be given licenses and taxed by the state rather than bringing in shacks, which will lead to economic losses for locals since conflict with investors (who are not natives) is bound to happen,” he said. Tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray had tweeted on Thursday that 80% employment from the shacks must be for locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/beach-shacks-may-cause-harm-to-turtle-nesting-sites/story-VNpudNjlZwqh6PI3WGbuDJ.html
28-06-2020||City||Two elderly women among 11 fresh Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh and around||Eleven fresh cases of Covid-19 were reported in the tricity on Saturday.While three, including a 76-year-old woman, were found infected in Chandigarh, a non-resident Indian is among four people who tested positive in Mohali. Meanwhile, four cases, including that of a 80-year-old woman, surfaced in Panchkula district.The number of confirmed cases have climbed to 428, 246 and 109 in Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula, respectively. Chandigarh health officials said the elderly woman who tested positive is staying with her four family members in Sector 30. She has four more family contacts in Sector 25 as well. All eight people have been sampled. A 31-year-old woman from Sector 46 has also tested positive. Her two family members were sampled. Another woman, aged 45, who resides in Sector 41, tested positive at the Mohali civil hospital. Her two family contacts are asymptomatic.Meanwhile, officials said four contacts of the 37-year-old Panjab University staffer who was found infected earlier this week have tested negative. There are 87 active cases in the city.Among the fresh cases in Mohali, there are two women — 24-year-old from Naba village and 26-year-old from Dharamgarh in Dera Bassi — who tested positive after delivering babies at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, Chandigarh. A 22-year-old youth from Mubarakpur in Dera Bassi was also found infected after reporting to hospital with flu-like symptoms. The fourth case is of a 51-year-old merchant navy officer who had recently returned home from Nigeria. Meanwhile, six people were discharged after recovering from Covid-19, bringing the number of active cases to 52.Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh along with a team of senior health officials visited a meat factory at Behra village in Dera Bassi, where five women workers have been reported to be affected so far. He ordered random sampling of all the factory workers to check the spread of the disease. The village has been turned into a micro containment zone. The team also visited three other micro containment zones: Harmilap Nagar, Baltana and Sector 91 in Mohali. Dr Manjit Singh said no outsider was being allowed to enter these zones. In Panchkula, 53-year-old mother and 80-year-old grandmother of an already infected man tested positive at Kot village in Barwala. The man had returned from Lucknow on June 19.A 36-year-old man from Beer Ghaggar village was also found infected, days after his wife and daughter tested positive. The fourth case is of a 25-year-old woman from Mahadev Colony in Panchkula.

28-06-2020||Mumbai||Maha sees record 5,318 new cases, count inches near 1.6L||Maharashtra on Saturday recorded 5,318 fresh Covid-19 cases — the fourth day in a row the state saw a record single-day jump in infections and the second consecutive day of over 5,000 cases. Additionally, the state has reconciled 1,050 cases from all districts and municipal corporations between March 9 and June 7, taking the total to 159,133. Mumbai on Saturday reported 1,402 new cases and 675 old cases have been reconciled, taking the day’s total to 2,077 — the highest number of cases reported in a day in Mumbai. The total number of cases reported in India’s worst-hit city has reached 74,252.The state recorded 167 fatalities on Saturday, taking the toll to 7,273. The case fatality rate (CFR) in the state stands at 4.57%. Of the deaths reported in the state on Saturday, 86 occurred in the past 48 hours and 81 deaths were before that. These include five in Jalgaon, four in Dhule, two each in Ahmednagar and Nashik, one each in Vasai-Virar, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Jalna and Latur, data from the state health department revealed. Mumbai recorded 41 new fatalities in the past 48 hours,while 64 fatalities from earlier weeks have been reconciled, taking the city’s toll to 4,284. The situation in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) continues to remain grave with a further rise in the satellite cities around Mumbai. Thane city and Kalyan-Dombivli continues to record a surge in cases. Thane city and Kalyan-Dombivli recorded its highest single-day spikes of 410 and 514 new cases, respectively. Navi Mumbai recorded 164 new cases, Thane district recorded 235 new cases. Bhiwandi and Vasai-Virar recorded 110 and 170 new cases, respectively.The Central government team is in Maharashtra to review the Covid-19 situation and planning in the state. A team headed by joint secretary of the Union ministry of health and family welfare, Lav Agarwal, visited Thane city to take a review of the situation on Saturday. The team asked the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) not to be scared of the increasing number of cases, instead, concentrate on decreasing the mortality rate, create awareness among residents, ensure norms of containment zones are followed, provide enough staff to Covid centres and hospitals, procure an adequate supply of necessary medicines and increase the number of screenings done every day.The team visited the new 1,000-bed hospital set up in the Global Impact hub in Saket and another hospital being set up in Kausa stadium in Mumbra. “Even though the number of positive cases is increasing, instead of being scared, the corporation will have to focus on improving the efficiency of the system. Ensure that the old and critically ill patients are provided hospital beds, so that the death rate would come down. The screening of people should also increase so that infected patients can be identified early. There is a need for awareness among people, so that all measures taken are for their own benefit, while norms should be strictly followed in containment zones,” Agarwal said.He added that movement in the containment zone should be strictly monitored and that the residents there should not go out of the zone, while outsiders should not be able to enter these zones. Agarwal added, “Co-ordination between testing labs, hospitals, and the health department is also important so that the patient will get beds easily.”State health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas, instructed the corporation to vigorously carry out contact tracing, increase quarantine facilities and testing capacity and improve sanitation of public toilets to keep the count in check.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had a meeting with the health ministry team at the Bal Thackeray memorial plot in Shivaji Park after the team visited Covid hospitals in Thane. Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde and minister Aaditya Thackeray were also present in the meeting, along with state officials. Thackeray, in the meeting, discussed measures to control the spread of the virus in the state.State health minister Rajesh Tope said the state government “expects more support” from the Centre in its fight against Covid-19. The minister said that the Centre has not provided adequate ventilators and is delaying decisions that can make nearly 3,000 doctors available for the state. “We have sought 5,000 ventilators from the Centre, but have only got 277 so far. We expect a lot from the Centre. We have also requested the prime minister to postpone final-year exams of postgraduate students pursuing medical courses or give marks based on internal exams. We have requested the Centre to make available trained doctors to work in ICUs. The Centre can do so, but they are not doing it. Around 3,000 trained doctors will be available in the state if the prime minister can convene a meeting in this regard as these laws are governed by the Centre,” he said, adding that the decision would be in the interest of the nation and not one state.According to Tope, the contagious nature of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19), has led to so many cases, however, the fatality rate of the virus is lower than H1N1 or swine flu which is at 10%. He added that the state government is attempting to keep the CFR lower in Covid-19 by getting drugs, including remdesivir, life-saving medical equipment such as ventilators, etc.“We have already decided to procure drugs including remdesivir and favipiravir, etc. for common people in each district in the state. It will not remain a drug for the rich and influential. This virus is contagious but the death rate through it is not as high as swine flu, which is over 10%. I think the mortality rate in Covid-19 will remain around 3%. But because the virus is contagious, the cases seem more. Even if there is a spike, we are working towards it not leading to death in cases. Our planning and goal is to further reduce the mortality rate,” Tope said.Tope also refuted the allegations made by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on the state not reporting around 1,000 out-of-hospital Covid-19 deaths in the state. The minister said that there have been delays in reconciliation, but there is no intention to hide. Tope called Fadnavis a “studious” leader and said valid suggestions are welcome from him, but he should not politicise the fight against Covid-19.“We are following ICMR guidelines. In some cases, a suspected Covid-19 patient dies, swab is collected for the test and the results come after two-three days. Doctors inform the local authorities, they in turn inform the department that brings out the daily figures. As reconciliation happens, all figures are reported. No death has ever been unreported and it will not happen in the future. There is a delay, but I told municipal commissioner and district collectors that it will not be tolerated. The Maharasthra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is working in a transparent manner and it has the trust of the people,” he said.Meanwhile, 4,430 patients were discharged on Saturday across the state, taking the total number of discharged people to 84,245. With a recovery rate of 52.94%, the state’s active case tally stands at 67,600. Maharashtra has so far tested 8,96,874 samples and has a positivity rate of 17.74%. Currently, 5,65,161 people are in home quarantine and 36,925 people are in institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-sees-record-5-318-new-cases-count-inches-near-1-6l/story-k9L8qFpHmfHvKnaQt0BzyI.html
28-06-2020||Chandigarh||Six Jhajjar villages come under locust attack, crops destroyed||Huge swarms of locusts entered around half a dozen villages in Jhajjar on Saturday and damaged up to 100% crops in some areas. Sachin Kumar, a young farmer from Khudan village, said locusts entered their fields from Rewari’s Jatusana block on Saturday morning and damaged their crops and fodder. “Though we were prepared to tackle the menace, the insects took just 20 minutes to destroy my entire bajra , cotton and jawar crops. We had never witnessed such an attack in our lives. The government should compensate us,” he added.The insects had settled in Jatusana block on Friday night where the local administration supervised the operation of spraying chemicals in order to kill the short-horned grasshoppers, which tend to cause widespread crop damage with their voracious feeding behaviour.Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal also visited Jatusana block on Saturday morning and inspected the affected areas.“Our officials, with the help of local farmers, had managed to kill one-third of locusts on Friday night in Jatusana block. As many as 18 fire tenders were also pressed into service to spray chemicals on these insects. We can eliminate these insects only when they settle in the night. We were expecting that the locust will move from Rewari to Jhajjar and then leave for Uttar Pradesh via Panipat. But due to change in wind direction, these insects moved to Gurugram, Faridabad and then towards Uttar Pradesh,” the minister added.A day earlier, swarms of locusts had entered as many as 36 villages in Mahendergarh district and some areas of Rewari, leaving the farmers worried.Jhajjar deputy commissioner Jitender Singh said the locusts had moved towards Gurugram from Jhajjar. Crops were not damaged on a large scale, he added.Govt failed to stop locust attack: HoodaCriticising the government’s role in managing the situation, leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said they (government) failed to stop the locust attack despite being alerted about the same six months ago.“The government has not taken enough measures to stop the insect attack. It should conduct special drives to assess the crop losses and compensate the farmers,” the former chief minister added. Alert sounded in PanipatAfter locust swarms entered the southern districts of Mahendergarh, Jhajjar and Sonepat, an alert was sounded in Panipat on Saturday. Farmers of the district have been advised to remain vigilant as locusts are expected to enter the district, especially the Samalkha and Israna blocks, by Saturday evening through Sonepat.Panipat DC Dharmendra Singh has advised farmers to use utensils and drums to drive away the locusts.He has directed officials of district agriculture department to ensure the availability of the insecticide ‘chlorpyrifos’: “Farmers should be ready with their tractors mounted with chemical sprayers as locusts may settle on trees at night,” the DC said. Swarms of locusts can travel up to 150km per day and eat every bit of greenery on their way.

28-06-2020||City||Large outbreak areas are in containment zones since April||Gurugram The eight large outbreak regions (LORs) in the district, which were identified by the district administration on Friday for implementing stringent curbs to control the spread of Covid-19, have not come out of containment zone tags since the initial phase of the lockdown. Despite announcing a number of measures to curb the movement of people and enforce social distancing, the results have not been satisfactory, officials said on Saturday. The number of cases has spiralled in these areas, most of which have high density of population. The officials said that due to delay in contact tracing in April and May, these areas have developed into Covid clusters. For instance, there were about 25-30 coronavirus cases in many of these regions until May. However, as per district administration’s Covid-19 data, localities such as Hari Nagar, Shakti Park, Dundahera and Jyoti Park have more than 250 cases now. Now, the district administration plans to ramp up policing and intensive health campaign from June 30 when the order on LORs becomes effective. According to the district administration, an LOR is the area where there are 15 or more positive cases. As many as eight wards have been declared as the LORs.The district administration officials said that they are working out a plan to identify the boundaries of these containment zones now designated as LORs. “Entry and exits will be controlled in these areas after identifying their boundaries by the respective sub-divisional magistrates. The movement of people will be curbed and intensive health campaign will be launched with screening of individuals and testing through rapid antigen tests. Commercial activities will also be curbed,” said Amit Khatri, Gurugram deputy commissioner, in a statement issued on Saturday. Local residents, meanwhile, have complained of poor surveillance by health workers and thin presence of police. “Shakti Park and Hari Nagar are both adjacent to Khandsa vegetable market, and a large number of migrant labourers who work in the market contracted the virus from there. Though the administration has changed the timing of wholesale market, the retail business has spread out to roads and streets in both these colonies. Social distancing and other safeguards are not enforced strictly,” said Satbir Tanwar, a resident of Shakti Park.Both the colonies are located in ward 23 and have remained designated as containment zones for the past two months. Till May 30, Hari Nagar had 12 positive cases while Shakti Park only eight cases. The total cases in both the areas are now more than 150.A visit by HT to both the localities on Saturday revealed that barricading was non-existent and entry and exits were not controlled with people moving freely in public places. “The police presence has remained thin and we have barricaded the street number one on our own in Shakti Park. The municipal authorities have sanitized the area only once, and residents have been forced to sanitize the area themselves,” said Tanwar.The population of Shakti Park is around 20,000 and almost 40% of people from UP and Bihar have returned to their native states. “We are dependent upon a single Asha worker who visits regularly. Very few people have been tested and administration must start rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests at the earliest,” said Dinesh Kumar, who owns a shop in Shakti Park.Ruab Ali, a resident of Hari Nagar, said that there was an immediate need to increase testing, boost police presence and barricade the colony to prevent the spread of pandemic. “These areas have very high density of population. It is difficult to sanitize the streets and maintain social distancing as people live in small rooms, share washrooms and common areas, “ said Yatender Hari, who owns a shop opposite the Khandsa market. HSVP officials engaged in contact tracing said that high density and large population made social distancing and contact tracing difficult, but they were working to find out a solution. Bharat Bhushan Gogia, estate officer, HSVP, said that they have taken several measures to boost contact tracing while working with the health department. “Our teams are working with local public health centres and compiling data on a real time basis and efforts are showing results,” he said. While in Dundahera, locals complained that none of the health workers visited their houses despite the surge in cases. Jitender, an employee with a private company, said, “There has been no door-to-door surveillance, though cases have been reported in the nearby lanes. Nobody has ever visited our family.”Some said that most of the families have already left after cases began to erupt in the area. on Saturday, the area wore a deserted look with most of the houses locked. Dundahera is one of the areas where a large number of workers employed in Delhi stay.Urmila, who runs a grocery store in the lane which has been sealed, said, “After the first Covid-19 case, the building where the patient lived was totally vacated. In the last two months, so many families have left the area fearing Covid-19.”The local police deployed in Dundahera said that four lanes have been sealed. “Our task is to prevent gathering of more than four people outside a shop or home. Also, to challan people who are not wearing mask,” said Ishwar Singh, a local police officer. The Gurugram police said that they would boost measures for strict enforcement of social distancing and other safeguards in large outbreak regions. The movement of people will be curbed, factories and commercial establishments will have to arrange for accommodation of workers at their premises and only emergency movement will be allowed from June 30, they said.Muhammed Akil, commissioner of police, said, “More than 2,000 police personnel are on Covid-19 duty. In the large outbreak areas, our focus is to strictly enforce wearing of mask and maintaining social distancing. Teams have been directed to prevent gathering of more than four people outside a shop or home. Also, to challan people who are not wearing mask. The teams will be strict now in issuing the challans if locals are found violating the norms by not wearing masks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/large-outbreak-areas-are-in-containment-zones-since-april/story-sdX15Yys6YoBOjBo06sYkN.html
28-06-2020||Mumbai||HC: No need to submit income certificate to avail free Covid treatment||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday ruled that Covid-19 patients will not be required to produce income certificates to avail of free treatment at charitable hospitals. The ruling also included directions to a charitable hospital in Mumbai to deposit the amount charged to seven slum-dwellers from Bandra for Covid-19 treatment, with the court.The bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice Madhav Jamdar refused to accept the argument advanced on behalf of KJ Somaiya Hospital and Research Centre, that to avail free treatment the patient is required to produce a threshold income certificate issued either by the tehsildar or social welfare officer.“We are not inclined to accept the submission made on behalf of respondent No 1 [Somaiya Hospital] that unless such certificate is produced by the petitioners at the threshold, the respondent No 1 is not liable to admit any such patient under those categories in the precarious situation prevailing at the date of admission of the petitioners,” said the bench.The court was hearing a petition filed by seven slum-dwellers from Bharat Nagar in Bandra (West), alleging that the hospital, run by a charitable trust, had charged exorbitant amounts for treating them for Covid-19.In the petition filed through advocate Vivek Shukla, the patients said they had been admitted to the charitable hospital between April 11 and 28 for Covid-19 treatment, but instead of getting free treatment, they were collectively charged ₹10.06 lakh.Acting on the petition, the court had earlier called for a report from the charity commissioner, Maharashtra. On Friday, the bench noticed that the report submitted was based only on the documents called for and submitted by the hospital, and was filed without visiting the premises and inspecting the records. Against this backdrop, the court on Friday directed the charitable hospital to deposit the sum of ₹10.06 lakh with the court in two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-no-need-to-submit-income-certificate-to-avail-free-covid-treatment/story-oRYcXAfCHEQUbY83pfgU3O.html

28-06-2020||Delhi||Amit Shah, Kejriwal visit 10,000-bed Chhatarpur Covid facility||Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday visited the newly built 10,000-bed Covid care facility in Chhatarpur to take stock of the arrangements at the centre. Shah was accompanied by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. HT had reported on June 12 that the Delhi government had taken over the campus of Radha Soami Satsang Beas, a spiritual organisation, that would accommodate at least 10,000 beds. Named after Sardar Patel, the facility is roughly the size of 22 football fields. It has been turned into a temporary hospital to treat patients of the coronavirus disease with mild to moderate symptoms. The Delhi government is also seeking to increase the number of beds available for patients by setting up makeshift hospitals in 40 hotels and 77 banquet halls. The idea is to add 15,800 beds for sick patients. Five hundred converted railway coaches will add another 8,000 beds for the city’s Covid-19 patients.“The facility has 2,000 beds ready now. Though it has fans, the centre will be cooled by 18,000 tonnes of air-conditioners. The facility will have two segments - Covid Care Centre (CCC), where asymptomatic positive cases will be treated, and Dedicated Covid Health Care (DCHC). The CCC will have 90% beds while the remaining would be in DCHC,” said a senior official in the south district administration.After the visit, the home minister tweeted: “Visited the ‘Sardar Patel COVID Care Centre’ in Delhi to review its preparedness. I thank Radha Soami Satsang Beas and all others who helped to create this huge Covid care facility. This 10,000 bed centre would provide huge relief to the people of Delhi.”“I applaud our courageous @ITBP_official personnel, who would be operating this Covid Care facility during these trying times. Their commitment to serve nation and people of Delhi is unparalleled. Modi govt at the centre is committed to provide all possible help to its citizens,” he said in another tweet.Kejriwal also applauded the support extended by the Beas. “In this hour of difficulty, I sought help to save Delhi and everyone has come forward to contribute enthusiastically. With the support of the Central government and Radha Soami Satsang Beas, such a large Covid centre has come up for Delhiites,” the CM tweeted.Of the total 10,208 beds at the centre, 10% are equipped with oxygen support devices. BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL) has deployed 100 workers to provided the power infrastructure at the site. As per Delhi government’s estimates, 23 Megawatt electricity would be needed to run the facility. “The BRPL is laying four dedicated 11KV feeders, which totals to around 22 Kms, using trenchless technology (which involves minimal road-cutting). All the cables are being laid-underground,” a BRPL spokesperson said.“Working against gruelling deadlines, BSES’ team has managed to commission a load of 4,000 KW (4 MW) by June 25. Rest of the load (19,000 kW or 19 MW) will be commissioned by July 5,” BRPL said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amit-shah-kejriwal-visit-10-000-bed-chhatarpur-covid-facility/story-wcEvF61yT8vapuuz973ljJ.html
28-06-2020||Delhi||Six who attended congregation at Markaz died in Delhi and Haryana: Police charge sheet||Six people, including a foreigner, had died due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) during treatment at hospitals in Delhi, Haryana and at a quarantine facility after being rescued from the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters, known as the Markaz, in Nizamuddin during the lockdown in March-end, the Delhi Police have told a Delhi court, in a charge sheet filed in May.Various agencies had mounted a rescue operation to remove over 2,300 people from the Markaz after several who had allegedly attended a religious congregation there returned to their respective home states and were tested positive for the virus. Seven deaths, six of which were in Telangana alone, were also reported. The deaths prompted the authorities to take measures to prevent the spread of the virus and file a criminal case against the Tablighi Jamaat chief Maulana Saad and six other office bearers, for defying a series of government directives, which curbed religious and large gatherings, issued to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the national capital. Charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and criminal conspiracy were added to the case after the deaths of some of the attendees. No arrests have been made in the case, so far.Advocate Fuzail Ayubi, counsel for the Markaz, said that the assumption of the investigating agency to charge his clients for 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) is completely “Misplaced” “The section 304 could not have been applied here in these circumstances and the assumption of the investigating agency is completely misplaced,” he said. According to the charge sheet filed in the case in the Saket court, the city police have said that during investigation it was found that six persons who were part of the religious congregation at the Markaz had lost their lives at the Lok Nayak hospital, a quarantine centre in Sultanpuri and AIIMS, Jhajjar.“As per the certificates issued by the concerned doctors, their deaths had occurred due to corona virus infection,” the charge sheet read.While Yousuf Sahibu (36) from Tamil Nadu died on March 31 at AIIMS, Jhajjar, and Modokulov Maksat (38), from Kyrgyzstan died at the same hospital on April 13. Two persons from Tamil Nadu—Majeeth Mustafa (68) and Thathkir Pichaikani (64) died at the Lok Nayak Hospital in Central Delhi, on April 9 and March 29 respectively.Another Tamil Nadu resident Mohammad Mustafa,60, had also died during treatment at the quarantine centre in Sultanpuri on April 22, the charge sheet says. The casualties also include a Delhi resident, Mohammad Aslam Abbasi (74) who died at the Lok Nayak hospital on March 31.The police have filed charge sheets against more than 900 foreigners and charged them for allegedly attending the religious congregation organised in March by the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters, in violation of their visa conditions and the Indian government’s guidelines on the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.In the charge sheet filed, the police said that the foreigners accepted that they had attended the religious congregation for the purpose of professing and propagating the principles and doctrines of the Tablighi Jamaat and had remained at its headquarters (Markaz) for some period.“In order to ascertain their visit to Banglewali Masjid, Hazrat Nizamuddin, Delhi the register maintained at the Banglewali Masjid was taken into police possession, which further confirms their visit, including their name, country, passport number, period of stay and date of expiry of visa,” the police said.The police also added that in order to substantiate the legitimacy of their visit to India, passports of 723 foreigners and Identity Cards of 23 Nepal nationals have been taken into possession through seizure/handing over memos.“Some of the accused foreign nationals were unable to provide / produce their passports. Despite efforts their passports could not be taken over till now. Hence, passport numbers of these foreign nationals have not been mentioned against their respective names and country of origin in the list of accused persons,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/six-who-attended-congregation-at-markaz-died-in-delhi-and-haryana-police-charge-sheet/story-uxr99KAHn3tivPjH1TgO2L.html
28-06-2020||Delhi||Assess if patients who died were brought to hospitals on time: Health min to Delhi govt||The union health ministry has advised the Delhi government to carry out an assessment of every person to die of Covid-19 in the city to check many days before their death they had been brought to the hospital and from where. This assessment has to focus on whether the person was in home isolation and whether (s)he was admitted to a hospital at the right time, according to the health ministry.This comes days after a flip-flop by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority on allowing home isolation in Delhi. The authority had initially mandated a five-day institutional isolation, then said all Covid-19 patients – including asymptomatic and those with mild symptoms – would have to visit the Covid Care Centre for an assessment.The decision to discontinue home isolation was taken to prevent deaths that took place when people reached late to hospitals.With Delhi reporting over 3,000 cases of the viral infection every day, the centre has stepped in to provide support for infrastructure, testing and consumables.A 1,000-bed field hospital has been created in Dhaula Kuan, which will start working from next week. The hospital has been constructed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation and manned by Army doctors and paramedics. The hospital will have oxygen, ICU and ventilator beds as well as a referral relationship with AIIMS, New Delhi.Around 2,000 of the 10,000 beds in the Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre set up at Radha Soami Satsang Beas, Chattarpur, have been operationalised with the support of medical teams from the Central Armed Police Forces and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police.The central government has also provided 425 ventilators for Delhi government-run hospitals. Over 11 lakh N-95 masks, almost 7 lakh PPE kits, and 44.8 lakh HCQ tablets (used by healthcare and frontline workers, and the caregivers of patients to prevent the infection).To ramp up testing in the city, the union health ministry, through ICMR, also approved a rapid antigen test and provided 50,000 kits to the Delhi government. The Delhi government has placed orders for another 6 lakh kits.The central government has also provided 4.7 lakh RT-PCR tests to 12 laboratories in Delhi, along with viral transport medium and extraction kits needed to do the test, according to a release by the union health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/assess-if-patients-who-died-were-brought-to-hospitals-on-time-health-min-to-delhi-govt/story-IMOxUirfcQOtTmgZBvihLM.html
28-06-2020||Delhi||Asha workers fight on 2 fronts: Against Covid-19, for better pay||At the forefront of the war against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Accredited Social Health Activist (Asha) workers in Delhi are fighting another battle on their own -- their right to seek better remuneration. They put in long hours while conducting door-to-door surveys, screening patients in home isolation or at testing centres but are paid just Rs 4,000 per month as basic salary.The Delhi Asha Workers’ Association (DAWA) has given several representations to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and health minister Satyendar Jain, requesting that the workers be paid Rs 10,000 per month during the pandemic.Teams of Asha workers and Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANMs) have been deployed in various parts of the city to screen the entire population to map the spread of Covid-19, as part of the survey ordered by the Centre last week. The survey will be completed by July 6.Also read | Sero survey in Delhi begins to map exposure to coronavirus“We are at the forefront of the battle against Covid-19, but our pay is not proportional to the work we do. The government had given Rs 5,000 to construction workers and auto drivers during the lockdown. And we are paid just Rs 4,000, including Rs 1,000 for Covid duty. The government should think about us too,” said Usha Thakur, the general secretary of DAWA, who is working in Najafgarh as part of the team that screens Covid-19 patients to check if they can isolate themselves at home.According to an order issued on April 13 by the Delhi State Health Mission, the workers are to receive get Rs 3,000 as core incentive along with Rs 1,000 for Covid-19 duty from April to June as announced by the Centre. “I’m the only earning member in my family, as my husband lost his job in February. As part of Covid-19 duty, we have to cover 50 or more houses daily for the survey. We are on duty all the time. Sometimes I get a call at night to locate a Covid-19 positive patient. After putting in long hours, all we get is Rs 4,000, including Rs 1,000 for Covid-19 duty,” said Rajan Bidhuri, who is deployed in Tughlaqabad village. To make ends meet, Bidhuri works extra hours taking pregnant women for check-ups and children before five for immunisation to the dispensary to earn the extra incentive. “I earned Rs 5,000 as an incentive, besides the Rs 4,000, in April. I’m yet to get my salary for May,” Bidhuri said.But not everyone can do other work to earn the incentive, as they are posted at testing centres or are given other Covid-19 duties.Also read | Govt using five weapons against Covid-19, says Delhi CM Arvind KejriwalPriti (36), who goes by her first name, said that she got just Rs 2,320 for April. “I have been on Covid-19 duty since April. But I didn’t even get Rs 4,000 (the amount assured by the government). It is difficult for us to do our other routine jobs along with Covid-19 duty. Moreover, a lot of migrant workers have gone back to their villages due to which there aren’t enough people, especially pregnant women and children, whom we can take to the dispensary for routine check-ups,” said Priti, who is currently posted at a testing centre in Vasant Vihar.Kavita Yadav, the state coordinator for Asha workers, All India United Traders Union Centre, said they have a list of 100-plus Asha workers who tested positive for Covid-19. The first Asha worker tested positive for Covid-19 in April. “They are risking their lives like all other essential service providers. Then why this disparity? Due to Covid-19, a majority of them are unable to do their regular work and are losing out on incentives. The order passed by the Delhi government regarding payment of core incentive is not being implemented at all the dispensaries. We request the government to look into our demand and ensure timely payment of salaries,” said Yadav. The Delhi government didn’t respond for comment despite repeated requests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/asha-workers-continue-to-fight-for-better-salaries/story-tF1HakHmfxfJeBZpEtMTiO.html

These facilities will have at least 100 beds each and will be attached to a Covid dedicated hospital, stated the orders that were issued later in the day.The decision comes after the first such Covid care facility was readied in the Central district on June 24. “On Wednesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal visited the 100-bed covid facility in Shehnai banquet hall which has been attached to Lok Nayak hospital. The hospital is located just across the road from the banquet hall. The chief minister liked the concept and the arrangements, and has now directed that each of the 11 districts in Delhi should have one such facility,” a health department official said.Accordingly, principal secretary (health and family welfare) Vikram Dev Dutt issued an order on Saturday evening, notifying one banquet hall each in eight of the 11 districts. Apart from Shehnai banquet hall, the others include JJV Marketing and Hotels Pvt Limited in New Delhi district which will have 100 beds and has been attached to Lok Nayak hospital, Pearl Grand Galaxy in Shahdara district with 135 beds (GTB hospital), Kanak Banquet hall with 100 beds in southeast district’s Sarita Vihar area (GTB hospital), Kundan banquet hall (160 beds) in southwest (Lok Nayak hospital), RK Banquet (160 beds) in West Delhi (Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty hospital), Heritage Grand (200 beds) in northwest Delhi (Deep Chand Bandhu hospital) and Zehan banquet hall (100 beds) in north Delhi (Satyawati Raja Harish Chandra hospital).Also read | Covid-19: As India records highest daily spike, Govt underlines recovery rate at 58%, mortality rate at 3%Three districts have been kept out of this for different reasons. The northeast district will have no such facility since the area is “densely populated”, the order stated. The South district is also not included in the plan because it has the 10,000-bed Covid facility, touted to the largest in the world, in Chhatarpur. Similarly, in the the east district a 500-bed Covid care facility is coming up at the Commonwealth Games Village.Since these facilities will be for Covid-19 patients with moderate symptoms, each bed will have oxygen concentrators as well as an IV fluid stand. If the patient’s condition worsens, he will be taken to the attached hospital immediately, the official said.“Identifying the banquet halls was not tough for the DMs because they already had the list of around 77 banquet halls across the city, requisition orders of which were issued weeks ago. So, they just had to scan through that list, do a final recce and pick the most suitable one to start the facility. The criteria for finalising these halls included a proper approach road for an ambulance and other parameters such as space for at least 100 beds and washrooms,” said an official in the revenue department.On June 13, HT reported that the Delhi government had identified 40 hotels and 77 banquet halls to be turned into Covid facilities, which once fully utilised can add over 15,800 beds to the city-state’s health care infrastructure.As per Saturday’s order, the DMs will have to provide beds, pillows and mattresses, while the banquet hall owners will arrange caretaking and housekeeping staff. “The linked hospitals will provide all doctors and medical staff, infrastructure, consumables, services, etc.”Addressing a digital press conference on Saturday, Kejriwal said the Delhi government is augmenting Covid beds at a “massive scale”. He said Delhi now has around 13,500 beds available out of which nearly 7,500 were vacant as on Saturday afternoon.“In the past one month, we scaled up the availability of Covid-19 beds in the city’s hospitals. Our first decision was to reserve at least 40% of beds in all major hospitals of Delhi for Covid patients. Second decision was to convert some government and private hospitals into dedicate Covid facilities. Thirdly, we attached several hotels were attached to hospitals. The hotels were against the move and went to court. We won the legal battle and now 3,500 beds are ready in various hotels across Delhi,” Kejriwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/one-banquet-hall-in-each-district-to-be-turned-into-a-100-bed-covid-facility/story-6lgyCXGUYWk7nhHM8hmwIL.html
28-06-2020||Delhi||Ten days after being designated Covid-only facility, Hindu Rao starts admitting patients||Ten days after it was designated a dedicated Covid-19 facility, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run Hindu Rao Hospital on Saturday finally started admitting patients suffering from the disease.According to officials in the north civic body, initially, the facility has started with 50 beds, and another 150 are to be added soon. “We did not want to delay the process, and since we had the logistics ready for 50 beds, we have started the facility. More beds will be added in phases soon,” said a senior corporation official who asked not to be named.However, some doctors raised concerns that donning and doffing areas for PPE kits had still not been created in the ward.An official from the hospital administration said, “So far we have got one Covid patient in the intensive care unit (ICU). We are expecting more patients by tonight.” The hospital had started a flu clinic where around 70-80 Covid-19 samples have been collected every day since June 16, when the hospital was supposed to operate as a Covid facility.Earlier this week, around 200 non-Covid patients were discharged or referred to other hospitals in order to vacate the hospital to prepare it for Covid patients. “There are still around 15-20 non-Covid patients admitted in the hospital, who too will be shifted to other facilities. We have not been admitting any non-Covid patients from last week itself,” the official said. The hospital authorities on Saturday morning issued directions to doctors, nursing staff and paramedics to shift out to the designated accommodations that have been provided in hotels and other such facilities for their stay during Covid duty, as per norms.“As per the norms, doctors will be accommodated in five-star hotels around Connaught Place, nursing staff in three-star hotels in Karol Bagh, while paramedics will be housed in budget hotels in Paharganj,” the above quoted corporation official said. The hospital’s resident doctors association had on Saturday morning staged a demonstration outside the main building for a slew of demands, including payment of pending salaries, providing separate accommodation during Covid duty and installation and repair of air-conditioning in the wards. Doctors had said wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) kits for 12-hour shifts without proper air-conditioning was not possible.“Our protest was fruitful, and the demands have been agreed upon. We will be shifting to the accommodations now as per duty. A batch of 80 doctors including senior residents, junior residents and interns have been assigned on Covid duty. A roster has been prepared. Also, the air conditioners were being repaired and we have been assured of getting the due salaries soon,” said Dr Sagar Deep Singh, a senior resident and vice-president, RDA.A senior North corporation official said, “The protests by doctors and paramedic staff have been called off. The salaries for June will be disbursed. We are waiting for the rest of the funds for pending dues.”On Friday, the paramedics and nursing staff association had protested non-payment of salaries for the last two months. A nursing officer, however, said, “We have been given assurance that the salaries will come for this month by next week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ten-days-after-being-designated-covid-only-facility-hindu-rao-starts-admitting-patients/story-ipM827U3Lvfr6gSXkDT9yH.html

However, around 300 labourers, who were left homeless after the incident, are struggling to make both ends meet in the absence of work.Left with nothing, but clothes they were wearing when the fire broke out in the morning of May 29, the labourers, who had been living in the village for over 25 years, could not even move back to home states due to lockdown.A labourer, Shanti Devi, said, “Most of us work as farm labourers and, this year, we have also got less work of paddy sowing due to the pandemic. All things, including furniture, electronic devices, the amount saved for emergencies, etc perished in the fire and we were in a dilemma what to do when the police and villagers came to their help.”“The police and villagers arranged food for us and gathered all the material required to rebuild shanties. However, in the absence of fans in this scorching heat, our children are facing a tough time. However, we are thankful to the villagers and police for providing us shelter,” said Raj Kumari, hoping that the life would slowly come back on the track.Commissioner of police (CP) Rakesh Agrawal, who had visited the village, had assured all help to the labourers.Meharban station house officer (SHO) Kulwant Singh Malhi said, “Police had arranged ‘langar’ for labourers after they were shifted to the local gurdwara. Agrawal also visited the gurdwara and appealed to residents to help the labourers. Ajaib Singh Goldy, a constable, also supported labourers through his NGO.” Sarpanch of Rawat village, Gurmail Singh, said, villagers came together to help the labour and over Rs 5 lakh were spent in arranging food, clearing the area and setting up shanties. “We are still working to provide other necessary things to labourers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/villagers-police-pitch-in-to-build-shanties-for-labourers-after-fire-in-ludhiana-village/story-RLP9zNZwCeJobiAKwbYcyI.html

Two blocks are still under construction and require at least four months for completion.Adesh Gupta, executive engineer, public works department (PWD), said, “We have received a sum of around Rs 5.5 crore from the state higher education department during the last two years and last payment was received eight months ago. The contractor has stopped work as no payment was released to him after November. I have written to the higher authorities to release the funds, so that the construction of remaining two blocks of the building can be completed. The project is worth Rs 12 crore.”As per the building design, it has three blocks -- science, arts and administrative. The science and arts blocks will comprise two floors and eight rooms for a chemistry laboratory, a zoology laboratory, a computer room, a staff room, a girls common room, toilets for boys and girls. The administrative block will comprise a library, principal’s office, a committee room, toilets, etc. The initiative for the government college in Ludhiana (east) was taken by Congress MLA Sanjay Talwar.Secretary, higher education and languages Rahul Bhandari said, “The matter is pending with the finance department for release of funds for this government college.”The foundation stone of the building was laid at the site on January 28, 2018. On April 11, 2018, a team comprising the director, public instructions (colleges), former deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal and other officers inspected a community centre at Jamalpur to start BA part 1 and part 2 classes temporarily from there. Students of these classes were supposed to be later shifted to the new college The higher education department permitted SCD Government College authorities to conduct an online admission process in 2018. The college admitted 80 students each of first and second years of Bachelor of Arts (BA) and classes have been conducted in the SCD Government College for the past two years and not at the community centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/construction-of-new-building-of-govt-college-in-ludhiana-east-comes-to-a-halt/story-7mKNPOw5cNUnKDgCXUPsbN.html

28-06-2020||World||Russian nickel producer admits pollution in Arctic tundra||A Russian metallurgical company said Sunday that it improperly pumped wastewater into the Arctic tundra and that it has suspended the responsible employees.The statement from Nornickel is the second time in a month the company has been connected to pollution in the ecologically delicate region.In May, around 21,000 tons of diesel fuel leaked after a reservoir at a Nornickel-operated power plant collapsed; some of the fuel entered a lake that feeds into an arm of the Arctic Sea.The statement came hours after the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported that water tainted with heavy metals from the tailings at a nickel-processing plant were being pumped into a river.Nornickel said the water was improperly pumped because of an overflowing sump; it said the water was “clarified” and there is no threat of waste leakage.Both facilities are near Norilsk, north of the Arctic Circle, 2,900 kilometers (1,800 miles) northeast of Moscow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-nickel-producer-admits-pollution-in-arctic-tundra/story-tBJAJuyWpFfUdJqjaFK8aL.html
28-06-2020||World||Trump denies being told about Russian bounties to kill US troops in Afghanistan||President Donald Trump on Sunday said he was never briefed about Russian efforts to pay bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan, blasting a New York Times report that he had been told about Moscow’s cash rewards but had not moved to respond. The White House and the Director of National Intelligence on Saturday denied the report.“Nobody briefed or told me, @VP Pence, or Chief of Staff @MarkMeadows about the so-called attacks on our troops in Afghanistan by Russians, as reported through an ‘anonymous source’ by the Fake News @nytimes. Everybody is denying it & there have not been many attacks on us,” Trump tweeted, calling on the newspaper to reveal its source. The Times on Friday reported that U.S. intelligence had concluded that a Russian military intelligence unit linked to assassination attempts in Europe had offered rewards for successful attacks last year on American and coalition soldiers, and that Islamist militants or those associated with them were believed to have collected some bounty money.Russia’s foreign ministry dismissed the report. Democrats, including Trump’s likely challenger Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden, cited the report and Trump’s denial as more evidence of the president ignoring allegations against Russia in a bid to accommodate President Vladimir Putin. “There is something very wrong here. But this must have an answer,” U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi told ABC News, adding that Trump has already given “gifts” to Putin by diminishing U.S. leadership in NATO, reducing U.S. forces in Germany and inviting Russia back into the G8.U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said at a news conference in New York on Sunday that the report showed the need for tough sanctions against Russia in the defense bill that the Senate will debate this week. Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department said Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and U.S. International Development Finance Corporation chief executive Adam Boehler had departed on Sunday for Doha, Islamabad and Tashkent to “urge support for all Afghans” ahead of Afghan peace talks and would also conduct video meetings with Afghan officials during the trip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-denies-being-told-about-russian-bounties-to-kill-us-troops-in-afghanistan/story-oR25amHsUPyXPegN0mLszN.html
28-06-2020||World||US is going to have strong rebound from coronavirus depression: White House official||The US is going to have a strong rebound from the depths of the China virus depression, but the country needs to work its way through for years with structural headwinds, a top White House official on trade and manufacturing said.The US is under a deep economic recession as a result of coronavirus pandemic that killed more than 120,000 Americans and infected over 2.5 million people, the highest in the world. The lockdown along with social distancing measure brought the economy to a standstill. The country is now gradually opening up and have given jobs; to a small section of the millions of Americans who lost their jobs during this pandemic.US President Donald Trump’s administration has accused China of cover-ups and lack of transparency regarding the pandemic, that originated from the central Chinese city of Wuhan. “We are going to have a strong rebound from the depths of the China virus depression. But it’s also true that we are going to face many years of working our way through these structural adjustments that are going to happen in our urban areas, as well as in key sectors like hospitality, entertainment, sports, and education,” Peter Navarro, Assistant to the US President for Trade and Manufacturing told Fox News in an interview. With a little over 120 days left for the November 3 presidential elections, Trump is trailing by nearly 10 points against his Democratic rival Joe Biden.Responding to questions, Navarro said that it is essential to re-elect Trump in November. “It’s so essential to have a man in the White House here who knows how to rebuild an economy,” he said. “It’s very clear. We’re going to finish what this president started. And let me just run down the list. This is the jobs president, the greatest jobs president in history. This is all about jobs. What that means is, all those jobs and supply chains that Joe Biden offshored during his 40 years of failure, we’re going to continue to bring them home,” he said. “Second thing, endless wars. All the endless wars that Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George Bush and others helped start, this president is going to put an end to the endless wars,” he added. The US is going to have a merit-based system of immigration that’s going to protect American workers from the depressive effects of cheap foreign labour, Navarro said. “So, that’s where we’re at. Now, the big thing here is going to be the SpaceX economy, the SpaceX fourth industrial revolution, that we’re going to need to work our way through these structural headwinds, as the China virus has had its way with just killing certain sectors, like hospitality and transportation, now even our education system at risk,” said the top White House official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-is-going-to-have-strong-rebound-from-coronavirus-depression-white-house-official/story-pjrSG2C6IXFPC6u4vxpcnK.html
28-06-2020||World||Trump tweets - then deletes - video of supporter yelling ‘white power’||US President Donald Trump on Sunday shared a video of a stand-off between anti-Trump protesters and his supporters in which a man chants “white power” -- before deleting it amid an outcry. “Thank you to the great people of The Villages,” Trump tweeted above the video clip. “The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats will Fall in the Fall.”The footage, apparently shot in a Florida retirement community, shows a man driving a golf-cart bearing “Trump 2020” and “America First” signs, being heckled by a roadside protester chanting “racist.”As they yell at each other, the driver repeatedly mouths the words “white power” with a raised fist.“White power! There you go, white power. Did you hear that?” the protester yells back at him.Trump tweeted the video shortly after 7:30 am. At 11 am it had been removed from his account -- and the White House shortly after issued a statement saying the president had not heard the “white power” chant before sharing the footage.“President Trump is a big fan of The Villages. He did not hear the one statement made on the video,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere.“What he did see was tremendous enthusiasm from his many supporters.”Trump has long been accused of fanning racial tensions, including during the nationwide reckoning over racial inequality triggered by the death-in-custody of African American George Floyd a month ago.Infamously, after deadly violence pitted neo-Nazis against counter-protesters in the Virginia city of Charlottesville in 2017, he declared there to be “very fine people on both sides.”The “Villages” video triggered an immediate backlash on social media, and Trump allies were pressed to defend it on the Sunday morning talk shows.The Republican Party’s only black senator, Tim Scott, interviewed on CNN’s “State of the Union,” called the entire video “offensive.”“We can play politics with it or we can’t. I’m not going to. I think it’s indefensible. We should take it down. That’s what I think.”Also questioned on CNN, Trump’s Health Secretary Alex Azar claimed he had not seen the footage or Trump’s tweet.“But obviously neither the president, his administration nor I would do anything to be supportive of white supremacy or anything that would support discrimination of any kind,” Azar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-tweets-video-of-fan-yelling-white-power/story-z4BxW0FPMSPHjHsl7BJVYK.html
28-06-2020||World||China deployed martial art trainers along Tibet during border tension with India: Reports||China earlier this month had deployed martial art trainers and members of a mountain club in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), which borders India, state media reports said Sunday.No specific reason was given in the state media reports about the new deployment but it was done during the ongoing border tension with India, which began in early May, and escalated into a deadly brawl earlier this month.Incidentally, bilateral agreements between India and China prevent the use of guns along the line of actual control (LAC).On the night of June 15 – the day the new troops presented themselves in Lhasa, the capital of TAR – at least 20 Indian army soldiers were killed in a clash with PLA troops in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley.China has admitted that PLA suffered casualties but is yet to reveal the numbers.No guns were used in the clash but soldiers from both sides fought hand-to-hand with rocks, batons and clubs. Among the newly deployed personnel and five new militia divisions are former members of a Mount Everest Olympic torch relay team and fighters from a mixed martial arts club.Interestingly, a leading Chinese military had recently praised the Indian mountain army as the best in the world.“Mountaineering is an essential skill for almost every member of the Indian mountain army. To this end, India even recruited a large number of professional mountaineers and amateur mountaineers from the private sector,” wrote Huang Guozhi, senior editor of Modern Weaponry magazine in an article this month.The new troop deployment was reported by national broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) and the PLA’s official military newspaper China National Defence News.Tibet commander Wang Haijiang said the Enbo Fight Club recruits would “greatly raise the organisation and mobilisation strength” of troops and their “rapid response and support ability,” the newspaper reported.The new troops were recruited with the aim of “strengthening the border and stabilising Tibet,” the Chinese newspaper reported.Wang had visited India in 2018 for the Sino-India “Hand-in-Hand” counter-terrorism exercise in Pune.In his comments, Wang did not confirm the new deployment was linked to the ongoing border tensions.Chinese state media have in recent weeks highlighted PLA’s drills held in TAR.An infantry battalion, for example, had carried out extensive drills with tanks and armed airborne personnel at heights over 15000 feet in TAR, the PLA had reported earlier in June.The rare announcement by PLA did not specify when the drill was held but said it was the armed forces’ Xizang (Tibet) Military Command that organised the exercise at heights over 4700 metres.The Xizang Military Command falls under the Chengdu Military region.New Delhi has rejected Beijing’s accusations that it was the Indian army, which provoked the tension and the violent clash.Explaining the context of the standoff and the issues the two sides are trying to address, external affairs ministry spokesperson, Anurag Srivastava said in a statement: “At the heart of the matter is that since early May, the Chinese side has been amassing a large contingent of troops and armaments along the LAC. This is not in accordance with the provisions of our various bilateral agreements, especially the key 1993 Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-deployed-martial-art-trainers-along-tibet-during-border-tension-with-india-reports/story-wf9kJluUhDHpkMPYTgDSAP.html
28-06-2020||World||Record Covid-19 single-day highs in 5 US states, Mike Pence cancels campaign events||Five US states have reported record single-day infections as the new surge in Covid-19 cases continued unabated in the south with yet another day of more than 40,000 new infections countrywide on Saturday.The Trump campaign has in grudging recognition of a deepening crisis cancelled some upcoming political events with Vice-President Mike Pence in some of the states with spiking numbers. President Donald Trump, who has been loathe to acknowledge the new crisis, recently held two rallies in states hit by the surge. One of them, at Tulsa, Oklahoma, which was thinly attended continues to make news days after. The Washington Post has reported that two campaign staffers had removed cards — saying “Do Not Sit Her, Please” — placed in alternate seats to enforce social distancing. Many members of the campaign staff who worked on the rally have since tested positive and at least one news correspondent who covered it.Undeterred, Trump had simply moved on to hold a rally in Arizona, another state hit by the surge, at yet another indoor event and also with complete disregard for social distancing norms. Arizona is among the 16 states identified by the White house coronavirus task force where Covid-19 cases have been shooting up. And it was among the five that reported record single-day highs Saturday.Florida led the five with 9,585 new cases. Arizona was next with 3,591; followed by Georgia with 1,990, South Carolina with 1,604. and Nevada with 1,099. Texas, which has revived some of the social distancing norms because of the surge, reported 5,700 new cases.The countrywide total of new infections was 42,597 for Saturday, taking the cumulative total to 2.51 million. Fatalities went up to 125,538 with 500 deaths in the past 24 hours.Vice-President Pence was scheduled to travel to Texas for a “Celebrate Freedom Rally” later Sunday, but had postponed similar events in Tuscan, Arizona and Florida. scheduled for next week “out of an abundance of caution” due to the spike in cases in these states, the campaign has said.Pence, who also heads the White House task force on coronavirus, will still visit these states as he had said Friday to get a “ground report” on the Covid-19 outbreak there. He will meet their governors — all three are Republican — and officials, but won’t hold political events.The Biden campaign lashed out at Pence for his Texas visit. “Vice President Pence’s trip to Dallas epitomizes the dismissive attitude this administration has taken in addressing this crisis from the onset,” Communications Director Kate Bedingfield said in a statement. “Our leaders should be tackling this pandemic head on and laying out concrete recovery plans for the American people -- not jet setting across the country to hold events that go against basic public health guidance. Families in the Lone Star state and across the country deserve better.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/record-covid-19-single-day-highs-in-5-us-states-mike-pence-cancels-campaign-events/story-1hBtDbn7RmQYV43WvHFFsJ.html

The comments come at a time when Oli is facing intense criticism from within the ruling Nepal Communist Party for his governance and handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.“A conspiracy is being hatched to remove me for releasing the country’s new map and getting it adopted through Parliament. In light of these discussions, the media reports from New Delhi, [the Indian] embassy’s activities and meetings in different hotels in Kathmandu, it’s not difficult to understand how people are openly active to topple me,” Oli said, speaking in Nepali.He added, “There is a race to remove me. It has been said people who commit such crimes should not be allowed to stay. Printing a map is called a crime.”Also read: Nepal-India border tensions rise, one killed. Explained in 10 pointsThere was no immediate reaction to Oli’s remarks from Indian officials. The Indian side has described Nepal’s new map as an “artificial enlargement of territorial claims” and said the onus is on the Nepalese side to create a positive atmosphere for talks to resolve the border row.On June 18, Nepal’s President Bidya Devi Bhandari signed the bill to give legal backing to the new map after it was approved by both houses of Parliament.During an ongoing meeting of the standing committee of the Nepal Communist Party, Oli has faced withering criticism from the faction led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”. A majority of members of the committee are with Prachanda and Oli skipped the committee’s session on Friday. Oli has also said several times that his stance on a nationalistic issue such as the new map will lead to efforts to oust him.“Nepal’s nationalism is not so weak that someone can dream of removing the country’s prime minister for publishing the new map and making it part of the Constitution...It is unthinkable,” Oli said on Sunday.Nepal hadn’t made a mistake as it has only asked for its own land back, and it has not claimed or tried to grab anyone else’s land, he said.Also read: As Nepal preps to vote on new map, a hint about India’s stance from Army chiefOli also contended he had been removed as the premier in 2016 for signing a transport and transit agreement with China. “Now, they’re having the same dream because the constitutional amendment has been passed and the map has been issued. They are upset on the inside for this crime being committed,” he said.He added that he didn’t covet the post but it was essential for him to remain. If he stepped down at this juncture, it would set a wrong precedent and any other premier who spoke in favour of Nepal would also be forced to quit, he said.The new map became a popular issue among the public and gained widespread backing from all political parties. However, experts said Oli himself doesn’t enjoy the same sort of popularity within his own party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/conspiracy-people-trying-to-topple-me-nepal-s-pm-accuses-india-after-border-map-row/story-g3X72DM4FV0xW4QLG361KO.html
28-06-2020||World||Summer may decide fate of leading shots in vaccine race||People on six continents already are getting jabs in the arm as the race for a Covid-19 vaccine enters a defining summer, with even bigger studies poised to prove if any shot really works -- and maybe offer a reality check.Already British and Chinese researchers are chasing the coronavirus beyond their borders, testing potential vaccines in Brazil and the United Arab Emirates because there are too few new infections at home to get clear answers.The U.S. is set to open the largest trials -- 30,000 people to test a government-created shot starting in July, followed about a month later with another 30,000 expected to test a British one.Those likely will be divided among Americans and volunteers in other countries such as Brazil or South Africa, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told The Associated Press.While he’s optimistic, “we’ve been burned before,” Fauci cautioned.Multiple successes, in multiple parts of the world, are vital.“This isn’t a race of who gets there first. This is, get as many approved, safe and effective vaccines as you possibly can,” Fauci said.Vaccine experts say it’s time to set public expectations. Many scientists don’t expect a coronavirus vaccine to be nearly as protective as the measles shot.If the best Covid-19 vaccine is only 50% effective, “that’s still to me a great vaccine,” said Dr. Drew Weissman of the University of Pennsylvania.“We need to start having this conversation now,” so people won’t be surprised, he added.And for all the government promises of stockpiling doses in hopes of starting vaccinations by year’s end, here’s the catch: Even if a shot pans out -- and it’s one that your country stockpiled -- only some high-risk people, such as essential workers, go to the front of a very long line.“Will you and I get vaccinated this year? No way,” said Duke University health economist David Ridley.THE HOME STRETCHVaccines train the body to rapidly recognize and fend off an invading germ. About 15 experimental Covid-19 vaccines are in various stages of human studies worldwide.And while there’s no guarantee any will pan out, moving three different kinds into final testing offers better odds -- especially since scientists don’t yet know just how strong an immune reaction the shots must spark to protect.Measuring that with the first proven vaccine will “really help us understand for all the other vaccines in development, do they also have a chance?” said Oxford University lead researcher Sarah Gilbert.Only China is pushing out “inactivated” vaccines, made by growing the new coronavirus and killing it. Vaccines by Sinovac Biotech and SinoPharm use that old-fashioned technology, which requires high-security labs to produce but is dependable, the way polio shots and some flu vaccines are made.Most other vaccines in the pipeline target not the whole germ but a key piece -- the “spike” protein that studs the surface of the coronavirus and helps it invade human cells. Leading candidates use new technologies that make shots faster to produce but haven’t yet been proven in people.Oxford’s method: Genetically engineer a chimpanzee cold virus so it won’t spread but can carry the gene for that spike protein into just enough cells to trick the immune system that an infection’s brewing.Another vaccine made by the NIH and Moderna Inc. simply injects a piece of the coronavirus genetic code that instructs the body to produce harmless spike copies that the immune system learns to recognize.CHASING THE VIRUSResearchers must test thousands of people not where Covid-19 is surging -- because then it’s too late -- but where it’s smoldering, Fauci said.Only if the virus starts spreading through a community several weeks after volunteers receive either a vaccine or a dummy shot -- time enough for the immune system to rev up -- do scientists have the best chance at comparing which group had more illness.Lacking a crystal ball, the NIH has vaccine testing networks in the U.S., South America and South Africa on standby while finalizing decisions on the summer tests.“We’re going to be doing it in multiple sites with a degree of flexibility” so researchers can rapidly shift as the virus moves, Fauci said. “Nothing is going to be easy.”The Oxford shot, with a 10,000-person study underway in England, already encountered that hurdle. Gilbert told a Parliament committee last week that there’s “little chance, frankly” of proving the vaccine’s effectiveness in Britain after infections plummeted with the lockdown.So her team looked abroad. In addition to the planned U.S.-run study, Brazil last week began a last-stage test of the Oxford shot in 5,000 health workers, the first experimental Covid-19 vaccinations in South America. In another first, South Africa opened a smaller safety study of the Oxford shot.With few new infections in China, Sinovac next month will begin final tests in 9,000 Brazilian volunteers. And SinoPharm just signed an agreement with the United Arab Emirates; that study’s size isn’t clear.EXPECT IMPERFECT PROTECTIONAnimal research suggests Covid-19 vaccines could prevent serious disease but may not completely block infection. One study that dripped the coronavirus into monkeys showed vaccinated animals avoided pneumonia but had some virus lurking in their noses and throats. Whether it was enough to spread to the unvaccinated isn’t known.Still, that would be a big win.“My expectations have always been that we’ll get rid of symptomatic disease. From what we’ve seen of the vaccines so far, that’s what they do,” said Penn’s Weissman.The initial vaccines might be replaced with later, better arrivals, as historically happens in medicine, noted Duke’s Ridley.And while shots in the arm are the fastest to make, those for respiratory diseases require virus-fighting antibodies to make their way into the lungs. Gilbert said Oxford eventually will explore nasal delivery.WARNING AGAINST SHORTCUTSSome U.S. lawmakers worry about pressure from the Trump administration to push out an unproven shot during the fall election season.“We want a vaccine, not a headline,” Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, said at a recent Senate committee hearing.Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, pledged to a House committee last week that any decision would be based on science.Different countries have different rules about when to release a vaccine. For the U.S., Fauci insisted there will be no safety shortcuts, a key reason NIH is investing in such huge studies.Regardless of how and when a vaccine arrives, each country also will prioritize who’s first in line as doses become available. Presumably they’ll start with health workers and those most vulnerable to severe disease — as long as each shot is proven to work in at-risk groups such as older adults.Because each vaccine works differently, “which population group it will protect, we don’t know yet,” said Dr. Mariangela Simao of the World Health Organization, which is advising countries on how to choose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/summer-may-decide-fate-of-leading-shots-in-vaccine-race/story-dhZ0YQ6ETJohKsawDtMGJJ.html
28-06-2020||World||Trump dismisses virus, polls and recession to tell winning story||The America that President Donald Trump describes is a place where the coronavirus outbreak is only surging because of increased testing, the economy is on the verge of roaring back to life and polls showing him losing re-election in a landslide are fiction.In the president’s telling, many of the Americans protesting police brutality are terrorists, anarchists and looters, and concerns about systemic racism are overblown. He claims that his is the most accomplished presidency in history, outshining all his predecessors but Abraham Lincoln on achievements for Black people.Four months before Americans decide whether to return Trump to the White House, the president has constructed a narrative of the U.S. under his leadership that veers far from reality. In fact, the coronavirus outbreak is resurgent, driven in part by hasty reopenings and an emerging political divide over wearing a mask. The economy may not recover until 2021 or later. Protests against police brutality have been largely peaceful -- though there has been some looting and violence -- and more political leaders in both parties publicly acknowledge the reality of pervasive racism in police departments and American society.And most importantly for his political future, polls show the president is rapidly losing ground to his presumptive re-election opponent, Democrat Joe Biden.Presidential candidates often describe an aspirational vision of the country. Ronald Reagan’s “Morning in America” is held up as the model of the hopeful message voters want to hear. Trump has called himself “a cheerleader,” but his detailed descriptions of life in America today run so counter to reality that even some of his allies are urging him to change course.Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, acknowledged that “there’s been a dip” in Trump’s support, adding it’s early yet. The president needs “a little more message discipline,” and to focus on subjects like the economy, he said.“Eventually, just make it more about policy, and less about your personality,” he told reporters in the Capitol.Senator Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who chairs the Finance Committee, publicly pleaded last week for Trump’s advisers to show the president a Wall Street Journal editorial warning that he faces a “repudiation” from voters.Grassley said Saturday on Twitter that Biden might “sit in his basement and not campaign and be elected president.”There’s little sign Trump will change direction. At the White House on Friday, Trump touted historic stock market gains, even with tens of millions of Americans still out of work and benchmark indices well below their February highs. Earlier this week he said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network that President Barack Obama had committed “treason” in the course of a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe of Trump’s 2016 campaign.On Thursday, Trump’s administration asked the Supreme Court to throw out the Affordable Care Act, including its protections for people with pre-existing health conditions, in its entirety -- despite the president’s frequent insistence that he will always protect such patients. He has never offered a plan to replace the law known as Obamacare.“The administration’s decision to submit this new brief is the wrong policy at the worst possible time as our nation is in the midst of a pandemic,” Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican facing a difficult re-election contest in November, said in a statement.On Saturday, Trump said on Twitter that he’d win re-election, once again proclaiming that a “silent majority” supports him. He boasted about high television ratings for his recent campaign events and said “these are the real polls, the Silent Majority, not FAKE POLLS!”In an interview published Saturday by The Federalist, a conservative website, Trump said he expects to be kicked off Twitter and mused about moving to a start-up platform that’s marketed itself to disaffected conservatives, Parler.Later, he tweeted a series of 15 Wanted posters for people alleged to have vandalized a statue near the White House. One wore a “Black Lives Matter” shirt.Trump v. CoronavirusNo issue has pitted Trump more squarely against reality than the coronavirus. U.S. cases have hit a new daily high, with the epicenter of the outbreak shifting from New York to the southern Sunbelt states from California to Florida. Republican governors there have backtracked on reopening their economies, closing bars and restricting other activities as the president urges Americans to put the pandemic behind them.Trump has repeatedly said, falsely, that the U.S. has more cases of Covid-19 because it’s conducting more testing for the disease. He’s also expressed skepticism that some of the reported cases are real. Trump’s aides have said they’re watching deaths more closely than total cases; deaths are still trending down but are a lagging indicator.“You’re going to have a kid with the sniffles, and they’ll say it’s coronavirus,” he said Thursday.Trump has pledged that a vaccine will soon be available. But even without one, the virus will “fade away,” he told Fox’s Sean Hannity earlier this month.During a White House coronavirus task force briefing Friday -- its first in two months, held at Health and Human Services headquarters and without Trump -- the president tweeted a wanted poster for 15 people who allegedly vandalized a statue.Meanwhile, the message at the briefing was muddled. Vice President Mike Pence both acknowledged the increase in cases and downplayed the threat.“There may be a tendency among the American people to think we are back to that place we were two months ago” when U.S. deaths peaked at more than 2,500 per day, Pence said. “The reality is we’re in a much better place.”He avoided saying whether Americans should wear masks. But reality intervened in the form of Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.“We are facing a serious problem in certain areas,” Fauci said. “We are all in it together and the only way we’re going to end it is by ending it together.”‘Defined’ BidenTrump’s campaign has said he remains competitive against a “defined” Biden, meaning when the former vice president is portrayed in a negative light.“Americans know that President Trump has been leading the nation through the coronavirus crisis and that Joe Biden has tried to use it as a political weapon,” communications director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement.Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s former chief of staff, said a Biden contrast is crucial.“The thing that the campaign is not doing extraordinarily well is drawing those comparisons,” Mulvaney said in a Fox News interview on Thursday.The top House Republican, Kevin McCarthy of California, acknowledged in a Fox News interview that Trump and his party are in a rut.“Look, if the election was today, yes, you’re concerned,” he said. “Can we do better? Yes, we can.”Trump canceled plans to travel to his New Jersey golf club this weekend, but otherwise hasn’t shifted course.“The president is very good at rejecting criticisms he doesn’t want to hear,” John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser who has published a book that paints an unflattering portrait of the president, told the Washington Post this week.Lack of DirectionThe president pressed ahead with a trademark campaign rally, brushing aside concern from public health authorities. But his supporters have shown they may be more alarmed about the disease than Trump; his first rally in three months in Tulsa, Oklahoma, drew far fewer people than he predicted.Pence defended the decision to hold rallies, saying Friday that “even in a health crisis, the American people don’t forfeit our constitutional rights.”The campaign hasn’t announced any more rallies, but Trump has turned his official schedule into a series of de facto campaign speeches. In a packed Phoenix church on Tuesday, the crowd cheered Trump calling the virus the “Kung Flu.”“No more masks!” someone shouted. Arizona currently is suffering one of the worst outbreaks in the U.S.The ongoing protests against police brutality, broadcast live for all to see, have been equally difficult for Trump to re-cast in his favor. Trump has searched for scapegoats, at one point, he declared that “Antifa,” an unorganized leftist protest movement that sometimes engages in violence, would be declared a terrorist organization. It wasn’t.On Thursday, as he flew to Wisconsin, he seized on a Fox News interview with a person the network purported to be a leader of Black Lives Matter -- which isn’t an organization, and has no leadership -- to brand the movement “Treason, Sedition, Insurrection!” in a tweet.He appears frustrated by Biden’s relative obscurity and elusiveness as a target. The former vice president last held a press conference on April 2, when he took a handful of questions from reporters over a Zoom call. He responded to two shouted questions from reporters on Memorial Day, May 25, but has not otherwise taken questions at virtual or in-person appearances.Biden has largely avoided network and cable news interviews in recent weeks while stepping up local TV appearances in battleground states.Trump’s path forward is clouded by an absence of direction. On Thursday, a participant in Hannity’s town hall asked Trump what he’s most proud of doing in his first term. Appointing judges, Trump answered. But when asked by Hannity what’d he do in a second term, Trump struggled to answer.“You know, the word ‘experience’ is still good,” he said, before recalling how infrequently he’d been to Washington before his election and calling Bolton an “idiot.”“In terms of the president and his message, he is haunted by this virus,” Geraldo Rivera, a Fox contributor and former Celebrity Apprentice contestant said after the interview. “I think it is the president’s fate that he will be judged by how America fares during the midst of this pandemic.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-dismisses-virus-polls-and-recession-to-tell-winning-story/story-m8EFcnUZAoxS8Qgjsq3foM.html
28-06-2020||World||Covid-19: UK’s ‘Little India’ town Leicester facing first local lockdown||The town of Leicester in the east Midlands – known as ‘Little India’ due to its large population of Indian heritage – is facing the first local lockdown due to growing infections in recent days, while public places elsewhere in England are due to re-open on July 4.According to Health secretary Matt Hancock, there has been an ‘outbreak’ in Leicester, but local mayor Peter Soulsby on Sunday said data was yet to be shared before the decision to impose local lockdown could be implemented.There was concern over messaging by the Boris Johnson government that continues to caution people about the prevalence of coronavirus, but has also announced re-opening several sectors of the economy from July 4. Quarantine plans for air passengers are also due to be relaxed next week.Home secretary Priti Patel on Sunday confirmed reports that Leicester could be placed under a local lockdown, while Claudia Webbe, Labour MP from Leicester East that has a large concentration of Asians, called for the lockdown due to a “perfect storm” of poverty, positive tests and higher ethnic diversity.She told BBC: “I don’t know why they’re not enforcing a lockdown - the evidence suggests there should be one.”Local businessman Uday Dholakia told HT: “Considering the diverse majority communities in Leicester, communication and conveyance of trust has been short of expectation. In a real global crisis, the local media , politicians and community stalwarts have been preoccupied with issues like the Gandhi statue, important though that is”.“The public intervention, although commendable at national level, has been patchy locally. Many of the business and community support networks have been systematically destroyed. Exclusion in all facets of life is obvious to see; Covid-19 has brutally exposed it”, he added.Four mobile testing units have been pressed into service in the town, as Soulsby called for more tests to be carried out. Reports said nearly 25 per cent of 2,494 cases there had been reported in two weeks before June 16.Ethnicity-wise figures for Leicester are not available, but latest figures from NHS England put the category of ‘Indian’ patients who died from the virus at the top of non-white casualties: 763. The figure would include those from London and other areas.Patel and other ministers continued to caution people over gathering in large numbers after reports of illegal music parties and Liverpool football fans congregating in large numbers to celebrate the club’s win last week.Wales first minister Mark Drakeford criticised the Johnson government’s messaging for England: “My concerns with the UK Government are sometimes less with the substance where I think we are all broadly trying to do the same things. I’m more concerned at the messaging”.“Here in Wales, I am very keen to continue to say to Welsh citizens: Coronavirus has not gone away. It remains something that kills people in Wales every day. If you don’t stay on top of it you will see things going backwards. And everything we have done together thrown away”.“And that’s a very different message I think to the message across the border. Where the message seems much more, you know, that it’s all over and you can go back to doing everything as you did before”, he told Sky News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-s-little-india-town-leicester-facing-first-local-lockdown/story-Bh2zwvegCPAcLXfYOlZo5I.html
28-06-2020||World||Global Covid-19 cases hit 10 million as pandemic gains momentum||Confirmed coronavirus cases across the globe surged past 10 million, a chilling reminder that the deadliest pandemic of the modern era is stronger than ever.The milestone is a rebuff to health experts and global leaders -- including U.S. President Donald Trump -- who had hoped early in the pandemic that it would fade away with the summer heat. Instead, infections are multiplying faster than ever.It took four months after the pathogen first surfaced in the Chinese city of Wuhan to reach 1 million infections. The spread of the coronavirus has steadily accelerated, compressing the time frame to a million additional cases every week now. And the latest milestone may serve only as a relative marker, as many believe the true number of infections to be higher given the difficulty of tracking infections.The daily official count reached 150,000 cases in mid-June, prompting World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to warn that the pandemic has entered “a new and dangerous phase.” The death toll is equally sobering, at almost 500,000, and some health officials predict 1 million fatalities may not be far off.“We haven’t seen the end of Covid-19, and we haven’t seen the full scope of it yet, either,” said Ali Mokdad, professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle. “This will be as dangerous as the Spanish flu in many ways,” he said, referring to the 1918 pandemic that infected an estimated 500 million people.U.S. ResurgenceThe global epicenter of the coronavirus is continuing to shift. First it was China, then Europe -- and now developing countries with weaker health-care systems like Brazil and India are reeling. Since late March, the U.S. has had the most cases globally and is still adding infections at a record daily pace as a resurgence overwhelms states like Texas, Arizona and Florida, forcing many to reverse plans to open their economies.Health officials and governments are increasingly accepting there may be no quick return to what life was like before the pandemic, as economies have been battered by prevention measures that restricted people’s movements and put a damper on consumption.“You will see the long impact of Covid-19 above and beyond the mortality we are counting right now,” said Mokdad. “Already the impact on our economies means that one year from now there will be less aid to poor countries, less money to buy vaccines or HIV medicines.”More LockdownsPeople are still trying to get on with interrupted lives. But more lockdowns and social distancing measures may not be out of the question.“Going back into a lockdown is a terrible option, but we do need to be flexible,” said Caroline Buckee, associate director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “The question for policy makers is how much of a rise are they willing to tolerate.”A recent outbreak in Beijing is a reminder that even places that had shown success in controlling the virus can’t keep it out indefinitely. The best hope lies in the development of a vaccine, which is unlikely to be ready this year despite a global race to come up with an effective shot.In the early stages of the outbreak, officials in the northern hemisphere pointed to the potential that the virus would go away in the summer with warm weather. Those hopes have been dashed.“It doesn’t look like there’s any significant impact right now from the weather,” Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the U.S., said this month. He had earlier noted that hot weather tends to slow lung infections.The situation may worsen when autumn comes. The U.S. and other northern countries will need to prepare for a flu season that will be complicated by the coronavirus pandemic, adding more stress on already stretched health-care systems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-covid-19-cases-hit-10-million-as-pandemic-gains-momentum/story-83iqx9JHiZUkXecgpOVTlK.html
28-06-2020||World||Majority of China’s BRI projects abroad adversely affected by Covid-19: Official||Majority of the projects under China’s ambitious multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) are either adversely or partially affected by the coronavirus pandemic, according to a Chinese official.About a fifth of the projects under the BRI, which aims to boost trade and investment across Asia, Africa and Europe to further China’s global influence, had been “seriously affected” by the pandemic, according to Wang Xiaolong, director-general of the foreign ministry’s international economic affairs department.About 40 per cent of the projects were “adversely affected”, and a further 30-40 per cent were “somewhat affected”, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post quoted Wang as saying.The BRI was launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping when he came to power in 2013. It aims to link Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Gulf region, Africa and Europe with a network of land and sea route. The CPEC, which connects Gwadar Port in Pakistan’s Balochistan with China’s Xinjiang province, is the flagship project of the BRI.China last week held the first video conference of the BRI as part of its efforts to kick start the projects.The projects which were disrupted included USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the report said. India has protested to China over the CPEC as it is being laid through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Some Asian countries, including Malaysia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Cambodia, and Sri Lanka have in the recent past either slammed the brakes on or reported delays for Chinese-funded projects, the Post reported.For instance, Covid-19 disruptions have affected the CPEC, Cambodia’s Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone and Indonesia’s Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail, it said.Many projects under BRI are either on hold or receiving minimal works.The BRI is seen as an attempt by China to further its influence abroad with infrastructure projects funded by Chinese investments all over the world. The initiative also led to allegations of smaller countries reeling under mounting Chinese debt after Sri Lanka gave its Hambantota port in a debt swap to China in 2017 on a 99-year lease.By early January, 2,951 BRI-linked projects valued at USD 3.87 trillion were planned or underway across the world, the Post quoted research and publishing firm Oxford Business Group.Many countries in Africa and Asia have not been able to continue with mega projects, mostly funded by Beijing, because they are struggling to service debts, the report said.In Nigeria, a USD 1.5 billion rail project is facing delays because of coronavirus disruptions, while many Chinese funded projects in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Algeria and Egypt have been put on hold or may be delayed as the countries fight to control the spread of Covid-19, it said.Many of the countries that took billions of dollars in loans from China to build mega projects – including motorways, ports, dams and railways – are knocking on Beijing’s door, asking for debt repayment freezes or some debt cancellations, according to the Post report.Earlier, President Xi promised African countries to write off all their interest-free loans due this year and asked Chinese financial institutions “to conduct consultations with African countries on commercial sovereign loan arrangements”, it said.China’s overall lending to Africa stood at USD 152 billion worth of loan commitments between 2000 and 2018, the report said, citing data compiled by the China Africa Research Initiative at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.Further, China’s policy banks – including China Exim Bank and China Development Bank – which fund most of the BRI projects, are now more cautious in their lending.Even before the pandemic, China’s policy banks were already reducing new belt and road loans. The lenders cut funding to energy projects to the lowest level in more than a decade last year, it said.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in his address to the meeting pushed for early resumption of the projects.“It is important to get key Belt and Road infrastructure projects restarted as early as possible, keep industrial and supply chains secure to provide a solid underpinning for the economic recovery of all countries,” he said.Bradley Parks, executive director of AidData, a research lab at the College of William and Mary in the US state of Virginia, said given that coronavirus cases were still rising, it was difficult and dangerous to continue doing this kind of on-site construction work.“I think we’re going to see a significant slowdown in the implementation of (belt and road) projects,” he said.James Crabtree, associate professor in practice at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, said the belt and road’s glory days might be over.“Facing a crunching post-pandemic slowdown, China has far less money to splash out on expensive infrastructure in Africa and elsewhere,” Crabtree said.He said President Xi was also facing severe political pressure on two fronts: from poor countries wanting loans cancelled and from his citizens who did not want the money sent abroad that could be used to aid recovery at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/majority-of-china-s-bri-projects-abroad-adversely-affected-by-covid-19-pandemic-official/story-SlwBqAoFISeSnZ7M7Gs8AL.html
28-06-2020||World||UK plans localised lockdowns as Covid-19 deaths among Indian-origin people remain high||The UK government on Sunday said it is planning to impose localised lockdowns in some regions showing a spike in coronavirus infections, as latest figures showed that Indian-origin people remain in the category of those hardest hit from the deadly virus among Britain’s ethnic minorities.Home Secretary Priti Patel confirmed as “correct” the reports of the first such local lockdown for Leicester, a region in eastern England with a large Indian-origin population.“We have seen flare-ups across the country already, just in the last three or four weeks in particular. There will be support going into Leicester,” said Patel.“With local flare-ups it is right we have a localised solution in terms of infection control, social distancing, testing and many of the tools actually within the Public Health England space that will come together to control the virus and to stop the spread so we can get on top of the infection,” she said.Patel’s confirmation came as England has seen an overall fall in the daily death toll and prepares to substantially lift its lockdown restrictions from July 4, when bars, restaurants and cinemas will begin to open up to public access amid Covid-secure guidelines of safe distancing and hygienic conditions.Meanwhile, the latest NHS England statistics revealed that 763 people identifying with Indian heritage have died so far in the pandemic, according to data collated until last Thursday. This continues to reflect three per cent of the total deaths officially recorded by the National Health Service (NHS) from coronavirus, first reported in April at the peak of the pandemic, followed by those of Pakistani and Caribbean heritage as the second-hardest hit ethnic groups at two per cent each.The UK government had conducted a review into the disparity in the impact from the coronavirus pandemic among the country’s black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups and Public Health England (PHE) said it is exploring further measures required to address the disproportionately adverse impact on some ethnicities.As part of some targeted measures, new official guidance was put in place earlier this week which requires pregnant women from BAME backgrounds to be fast-tracked to hospital because of their increased risk of coronavirus.“While Public Health England is continuing to assess and advise on the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on ethnic groups, I want to make sure that the NHS is doing everything we can to reach out, reassure and support those pregnant women and new mums most at risk,” said Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, the Chief Midwifery Officer for England.All hospitals have also been instructed to complete risk assessments for staff who are perceived at being at a higher risk of coronavirus, including those from a BAME background and with underlying health conditions. The UK has so far reported 311,739 coronavirus cases and 43,598 fatalities due to the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-plans-localised-lockdowns-as-covid-19-deaths-among-indian-origin-people-remain-high/story-fev8QFBeUNJMcmrQr88twL.html
28-06-2020||World||Black Lives Matter: Church of England orders ‘very careful’ review of statues||The Church of England has joined the growing reviews of monuments and public spaces prompted by the Black Lives Matter (BLM) campaign that has seen major protests in the UK and elsewhere, besides demands to pull down statues of individuals with links to slavery.The Church of England said it has more than 16,000 churches and 42 cathedrals, almost all of which are home to memorials and monuments to individuals from a period spanning more than a thousand years. The histories of the individuals are being examined.Justin Welby, archbishop of Canterbury, has said the review will be conducted “very carefully” to assess if they should be retained in their places or not. The very image of Jesus as a ‘white Jesus’ will need to be reconsidered, since every culture has a different image of him, he added.The church said that the events of the past weeks in response to the death of George Floyd in the United States have brought into focus the question of monuments to individuals who have participated in systemic and targeted discrimination or exploitation based on race.Church of England’s director of church buildings and cathedrals, Becky Clark, said: “Action is being taken by parishes and cathedrals across England to consider monuments which have links to slave trading or the exploitation of people”.“Some churches have previously acknowledged and exposed this legacy, but many are just beginning this work in response to the spotlight shone on these questions by the Black Lives Matter movement”.Welby told BBC: “Some will have to come down, some names will have to change,” adding that the historical acts of those memorialised could be forgiven “only if there’s justice”, and that forgiveness can only be granted “if we change the way we behave now and say this was then and we learn from that and change how we are going to be in the future”.Clark added that the decision about retaining or removing statues will be taken locally by dioceses as they confront the complex challenges of the past and the reality of the present and how the past impacts people living today.The Greater London Authority, councils across the UK and organisations such as the National Trust have initiated reviews of public spaces under their jurisdiction, following major protests in London and elsewhere and the pulling down of slave trader Edward Colston’s statue in Bristol earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-church-of-england-orders-very-careful-review-of-statues/story-Q0mEuZKjlB8x6TQ3kawHqJ.html
28-06-2020||World||China lawmakers review draft of Hong Kong’s national security bill: Report||China’s lawmakers have reviewed a draft of the national security bill for Hong Kong during a meeting held by the standing committee of the National People’s Congress (NPC), state media Xinhua reported on Sunday. In the meeting, Shen Chunyao, director of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the NPC’s standing committee, presented a report on the bill, Xinhua said. The NPC’s Standing Committee usually meets every two months, but the three-day meeting starting on Sunday is the second meeting in June to review the bill. The committee is widely expected to pass the bill into law before the meeting ends on Tuesday. The proposed bill has raised concerns among Hong Kong democracy activists and some foreign governments that Beijing is further eroding the extensive autonomy promised when Britain handed the territory back to China under a “one country, two systems” formula in 1997. China has said, however, the bill will target only a small group of troublemakers as it tackles separatism, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference in Hong Kong. Full details of the legislation have not been made public. Hundreds of Hong Kongers marched silently through the city’s streets on Sunday to protest the bill. Riot police armed with shields were present and used pepper spray on protesters when scuffles broke out in Mong Kok during the event. China’s Global Times editor-in-chief, Hu Xijin, said in a tweet on Sunday the Hong Kong national security bill will “overwhelm HK Human Rights & Democracy Act, which US uses to interfere in HK affairs. In HK, people who’ve harmed nat’l security have shown fear of the upcoming law. It’s good.”He said the bill “could be passed within days” and is “expected to be enforced powerfully.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-lawmakers-review-draft-of-hong-kong-s-national-security-bill-report/story-4HhLmcA8gQjY3DAgwX58QK.html
28-06-2020||World||Children more resilient against Covid-19: Lancet study||The majority of children with Covid-19 in 26 countries fared well clinically compared to adults, according to a review of studies which assessed research published during the first four months of the pandemic. Scientists, including those from The University of Texas in the US, performed the largest systematic review to date of children and young adults with Covid-19, assessing the clinical data of more than 7,500 individuals.  In the findings, published in the journal EClinicalMedicine, a journal of The Lancet, they said nearly a fifth of the pediatric population with Covid-19 did not exhibit any symptoms, and 21 per cent of the children exhibited patchy marks of tissue injury on lung X-rays. The researchers said 5.6 per cent of the children assessed in the studies suffered from co-infections, such as flu, on top of Covid-19, and a little more than 3 per cent were admitted to intensive care units. Seven deaths were reported, according to the review research. “Our data is compiled from 131 studies and encompasses 7,780 patients who span the pediatric age spectrum,” said study senior author Alvaro Moreira from UT. The research reported the most common symptoms, quantified laboratory findings, and described X-ray scan characteristics of children with Covid-19. “Furthermore, we summarise treatments that were administered and offer an initial glimpse of a handful of patients who met the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children,” Moreira said. According to the study, the most frequent symptoms, similar to the adult population, were fever and cough -- found in 59 and 56 per cent of the pediatric population, respectively. In 233 individuals, the scientists said a past medical history was noted with 152 children in the group presenting with compromised immune systems, or had underlying respiratory or cardiac disease. “Although we are hearing about severe forms of the disease in children, this is occurring in very rare circumstances,” Moreira said.Based on laboratory measures noted in the reviewed studies, the scientists said pediatric Covid-19 patients had abnormal levels of molecules signifying inflammation in the body like creatine kinase, interleukin-6, and procalcitonin. According to the scientists, only a small number of patients met inclusion for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. They said the disease condition in these children paralleled the extreme forms of Covid-19 seen in adults. “Children with systemic inflammation had a significant decrease in the amount of lymphocytes in their blood,” Moreira said. Covid-positive children who didn’t have the extreme form of the disease had 42 per cent of the immune cells called lymphocytes in their blood, versus 11 per cent in children with the multisystem syndrome, he added.The scientists said kidney failure was seen in nine pediatric patients, liver failure also in nine, and shock in 19. They said mechanical ventilation was required by 42 patients. While the review research provides evidence that children with COVID-19 have an overall better prognosis, the scientists said further studies are needed to confirm the findings, and “better understand which patients are at increased risk for developing severe inflammation and multiorgan failure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/children-more-resilient-against-covid-19-lancet-study/story-xRCj6qpmD4pKPJuF4qmV7J.html
28-06-2020||World||China top lawmakers discussed Hong Kong security law: Report||China’s top legislative body discussed Hong Kong’s security legislation on Sunday, Radio Television Hong Kong reported, signaling Beijing may soon hand down a measure that pro-democracy activists and business groups say could erode the city’s unique freedoms.At a three-day meeting that started Sunday, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee considered the legislation to punish acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, RTHK said, citing Hong Kong non-voting delegate Ip Kwok-him. The NPC has received various opinions about the proposed law and will make “some adjustment,” but the change will not be substantial, he said.Ip said he believed the proposed law for Hong Kong was included on the voting agenda, but details will not be published before the vote has taken place.Stanley Ng Chau-pei, another Hong Kong delegate who attended the meeting with no voting rights, told local television TVB that he had seen the latest draft of the legislation, and that the group discussion he sat in formed “consistent opinion” on the bill. He declined to elaborate on the contents of the legislation and wasn’t sure if the three-day meeting would pass the bill.Chinese President Xi Jinping’s government announced plans in late May to impose the legislation on the former British colony following an unprecedented wave of protests last year. If the proposed law passes during this NPC session, it could come into effect in time for the symbolic July 1 anniversary of the city’s return to Chinese rule in 1997.Pro-democracy politicians and foreign governments including the U.S. have criticized the proposed law as a blow to the “one country, two systems” principle that keeps Hong Kong’s legal system separate from the mainland. About 56% of residents oppose the legislation, compared with 34% who support it, according to a Reuters/Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute poll released Friday.Hong Kong officials have defended the new law as necessary to maintain social stability after last year’s protests, despite acknowledging they haven’t seen the full proposal. Details released by state media last week showed that Beijing planned to set up a local intelligence bureau, take control of some sensitive cases and remove the court’s ability to select judges on security matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-top-lawmakers-discussed-hong-kong-security-law-report/story-M5phyvdCK3H606V0HIZL2K.html
28-06-2020||World||China places half a million in lockdown near Beijing over new Covid-19 cases||China imposed a strict lockdown on nearly half a million people near the capital to contain a fresh coronavirus outbreak on Sunday, as authorities warned it was soon to “relax” over the new cluster of cases.After China largely brought the virus under control, hundreds have been infected in Beijing and cases have emerged in neighbouring Hebei province.Health officials said Sunday that Anxin county -- about 150 kilometres (90 miles) from Beijing -- will be “fully enclosed and controlled”, the same strict measures imposed at the height of the pandemic in the city of Wuhan earlier this year.Now, only one person from each family will be allowed to go out once a day to purchase necessities such as food and medicine, the county’s epidemic prevention task force said in a statement.Earlier the county had been subject to some travel restrictions, but now individuals are only allowed to leave their homes to seek medical treatment, the notice said.The move comes after another 14 cases of the virus were reported in the past 24 hours in Beijing, taking the total to 311 since mid-June.The outbreak was first detected in Beijing’s sprawling Xinfadi wholesale food market, which supplies much of the city’s fresh produce and sparked concerns over the safety of the food supply chain.Businesses in Anxin county had supplied freshwater fish to the market, state news agency Xinhua reported.Some 12 cases of the novel coronavirus were found in the area, including 11 linked to Xinfadi market, the state-run Global Times reported.The new cases in Beijing have prompted fears of a resurgence of the virus in China.The capital has mass-tested wholesale market workers, restaurant workers, residents of medium and high-risk neighbourhoods and delivery couriers over the past week. Testing has now expanded to include all employees of the city’s beauty parlours and hair salons, the Global Times said.Beijing city official Xu Hejian told reporters Saturday: “There is no room for us to relax.”City officials have urged people not to leave the city, closed schools again and locked down dozens of residential compounds to stamp out the virus.But Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiology expert at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters last week the new outbreak had been “brought under control”, and officials lifted a weeks-long lockdown imposed on seven communities in Beijing on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-places-half-a-million-in-lockdown-near-beijing-over-new-covid-19-cases/story-m6N0BRvrf62AQaesCURqEO.html

President Arif Alvi on Saturday approved August 18, 2020 as the poll day for general elections to the Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) Legislative Assembly, according to a statement from the President House.The GB Election Commission will hold the elections in 24 constituencies, according to the statement.The Gilgit-Baltistan order of 2018 provided for administrative changes, including authorising the Prime Minister of Pakistan to legislate on an array of subjects. India last month issued a demarche to a senior Pakistani diplomat in New Delhi and lodged a strong protest over the apex court ruling. India also clearly conveyed to Pakistan that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, including the areas of Gilgit and Baltistan, are an integral part of the country.The Ministry of External Affairs said the government of Pakistan or its judiciary has no locus standi on territories “illegally and forcibly” occupied by it.President Alvi last month promulgated an order to form a caretaker government and for extension of the Elections Act 2017 of Pakistan to Gilgit-Baltistan. The GB legislative assembly was dissolved on completion of its term on June 24.The federal government has appointed Mir Afzal, a former deputy inspector general of police, as the “caretaker chief minister”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-hold-general-elections-in-gilgit-baltistan-on-august-18/story-cZZ3SKfRZRKTn3zjEN89TO.html
28-06-2020||World||Chinese firm CNBG says Covid-19 vaccine candidate shows promise in human test||China National Biotec Group (CNBG) said on Sunday that early human test results for a coronavirus vaccine candidate suggested it could be safe and effective, the second vaccine candidate from the firm to show encouraging results in a clinical trial.The experimental shot, developed by a Beijing-based unit of CNBG, has induced high-level antibodies in all the inoculated participants in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial involving 1,120 healthy people, according to preliminary data of the trial, CNBG said in a posting on the social media platform WeChat, without disclosing specific readings.Chinese companies and researchers have been allowed to test eight vaccine candidates in humans at home and abroad, making China a major front-runner in the race to develop a shot against the virus that has killed nearly 500,000 people globally.CNBG, affiliated to the state-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), said earlier this month that another vaccine candidate produced by its Wuhan-based unit also triggered high-level antibodies safely in clinical trial participants based on preliminary results.A vaccine has to prove its effectiveness in “Phase 3” human test where thousands of participants are recruited in order to be cleared for sale. CNBG said on Tuesday it will run a Phase 3 for its vaccine candidate in the United Arab Emirates, without specifying which shot will be tested.

28-06-2020||World||Israeli court releases anti-Benjamin Netanyahu activist after arrest||A Jerusalem court early on Sunday ordered the release of a leading activist opposed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s rule and whose arrest prompted hundreds to protest outside the Israeli leader’s residence.Retired Brig. Gen. Amir Haskel has been a leader of the protest movement against Netanyahu, demanding that the long-time leader step down while facing charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes. Haskel and several others were detained on Friday in what police said was an “illegal” demonstration because the protesters blocked roads.Haskel, a former top Israeli air force general, has become a symbol of the protest movement that opposes Netanyahu’s continued rule. Demonstrations have been held regularly around the country, with protesters waving signs reading “crime minister” and calling for Netanyahu to resign.“No one will prevent us from protesting anywhere,” Haskel said upon his release, adding a barb toward Netanyahu about his own brief experience in jail. “We were in Hadarim prison for 15 hours. It wasn’t pleasant, but it wasn’t terrible.”The arrests drew angry denunciations from prominent Israelis and sent hundreds out to protest outside Netanyahu’s residence on Saturday, with many slamming the police for making what they viewed as politically-motivated arrests.Police said they offered to release Haskel and others if they agreed to refrain from returning to the scene of the protests. Haskel and two others refused.Gabi Lasky, the lawyer representing Haskel, told Israeli Army Radio that the court eventually released him without conditions, saying protesting was the foundation of democracy.The country’s acting police chief said the force would learn a lesson from the incident.“The role of the police is to allow freedom of expression and demonstration to every person and to keep the public peace and security, this regardless of the protest’s subject, the identity of the protesters or their opinions,” acting commissioner Motti Cohen said.Netanyahu is on trial for a series of scandals in which he allegedly received lavish gifts from billionaire friends and traded regulatory favours with media moguls for more palatable coverage of himself and his family. The trial is set to resume next month.Netanyahu has denied wrongdoing, calling the charges a witch-hunt against him by a hostile media and a biased law enforcement system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-court-releases-anti-benjamin-netanyahu-activist-after-arrest/story-WqFIwn7OKFEGqjCKthLYsI.html
28-06-2020||World||Poland votes in critical moment for Europe’s post-Covid-19 future||Polish citizens are voting in a presidential election that will determine the fate of the east European country’s nationalist makeover.After voiding a ballot in May due to the coronavirus pandemic, Poland on Sunday holds the first of an expected two rounds of voting to determine whether to re-elect President Andrzej Duda. Polling stations will close at 9 p.m. (3 p.m. EST), when an exit poll will be published.The campaign has been tough for the incumbent as the Covid crisis pushes Poland into its first recession in three decades. Leading opposition candidate Rafal Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw, tapped into the discontent with his “We’ve had enough!” rally cry, while Duda turned to familiar tactics when his popularity dipped.The president picked on gay people, praised Catholic family values and cozied up to Donald Trump. Duda’s Poland is no stranger to divisive politics but as he seeks a second term, the question is whether the us-against-them narrative of the governing Law & Justice party will yield another victory and raise the alarm again for Europe.Problem ChildThe vote is a critical moment for a nation that until recently was hailed as a model of transformation from communism to a thriving democracy. By clashing with the European Union over everything from LGBT rights to the independence of courts and control of the media, Poland turned into a problem child.Now the country will decide whether the leadership will get carte blanche to complete its project by re-electing a president whose job has been to endorse its power grab. The risk for an EU grappling with the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout is that Poland goes the way of Hungary, already seen by many in Brussels as a lost cause.US think tank Freedom House said that given Poland’s current trajectory, it may not even be considered a functioning democracy by the end of Duda’s potential second term. “If this continues for another five years it’s very likely that Poland will find itself outside the democracy category,” said Zselyke Csaky, a Freedom House research director.The vote is Duda’s to lose. Polls show he still has a healthy lead and should win the first round, followed by Trzaskowski. If no candidate wins at least half of the votes on Sunday, polling for a run-off -- slated for July 12 -- suggests the result would be too close to call.Duda has accused the LGBT community of threatening Polish families and championed the government’s social-security handouts. This week, he visited the White House for talks with Trump. The American president has praised Warsaw’s spending on military equipment and the drive to chart its own “Poland first” path within the EU.Turning PointWhile the meeting failed to produce a sweeping defense agreement long advocated by Poland, public television hailed the visit as a resounding success and a turning point in the country’s history.The network -- the main source of news for many Poles -- has “abandoned any pretence of being a public-service broadcaster” in the run-up to the election, acting almost exclusively as the mouthpiece of the government and of the president, according to global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders.A Duda loss would jeopardize Law & Justice’s ability to push through some legislation. The party has enough seats in parliament to pass laws, though not enough to override a presidential veto.The party built power by attacking “corrupt elites” and promising a fairer, safer country for ordinary citizens after decades of fast-paced changes following communism. But its five-year rule has been marred by unprecedented EU lawsuits detailing how it’s eroding democratic values and removing the checks and balances on its power.The Covid crisis disrupted the ruling party’s narrative as frustration rises along with unemployment. Voter expectations for government relief are growing and exposing the limits of the party’s media machine.“The masks have fallen,” said Adam Bodnar, Poland’s ombudsman for human rights. “The line dividing those in power and the rest of the society is much clearer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poland-votes-in-critical-moment-for-europe-s-post-covid-19-future/story-xTBIjvUChZWLxRMCh5yTrN.html
28-06-2020||World||Taiwan celebrates Pride Month with world’s only public parade||Taipei will be the only city in the world to celebrate Pride Month with a march Sunday, highlighting Taiwan’s success in keeping the coronavirus outbreak largely under control.The parade is scheduled to begin Sunday afternoon close to the Presidential Office in Taipei. Coming just over a year after Taiwan became the first place in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage, the event cements the island’s status as one of the most LGBTQ-friendly places in the region.Taipei hosts one of Asia’s largest Pride parades every October, attended by tens of thousands of people from all over the world. The community is holding an additional event Sunday during Pride month, which marks the anniversary of the Stonewall riots in New York in 1969, a key moment in the early fight for LGBTQ rights.More than 500 Pride events originally scheduled for June have been canceled around the world due to the pandemic, according to the organizers of the Taipei march. Some will still go ahead but remain online only.The Taipei celebration is taking place as life gets back to normal in Taiwan. The island has reported fewer than 450 cases of the coronavirus in total since the outbreak began, with seven deaths. The government has eased regulations on large-scale events, social distancing and business travel over the past month after registering no domestic transmission of the virus since early April.As China Fights Second Wave, Taiwan Starts Stockpiling AgainTaipei has established itself as a center for LGBTQ rights in East Asia. Around 80,000 people come to the Taiwanese capital every year for the annual Pride march. Openly gay and transgender presenters have been a fixture on Taiwanese television for much of the past two decades. In 2016, the government appointed Audrey Tang as a minister without portfolio, one of the few cabinet-level transgender officials in the world.Since the government legalized gay marriage in May last year, more than 3,500 same-sex couples have tied the knot in Taiwan, according to government data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-celebrates-pride-month-with-world-s-only-public-parade/story-wOD4M6Sad7l1U2wJEe4ccL.html

The 22-year-old mother was driving home on Saturday afternoon when the attacker pulled up next to her car and fired around eight shots, striking the infant in the chest and grazing her head, police said. “This is happening far too often,” Chicago police operations chief Fred Waller told reporters near where the shooting took place in the city’s south. “When is this going to stop? When are we gonna say enough is enough?”The incident came a week after the shooting death of three-year-old Mekhi James, who died in similar circumstances while traveling in a car with his father on the city’s west side. “We’ll catch the person that killed that three-year-old. We’ll catch the person who killed this kid,” Waller said.Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot and police superintendent David Brown asked the city’s residents to speak up if they had information on Saturday’s attack. “We ALL need to be outraged by the violence we are seeing in our city. This baby, and all of our residents, deserve better,” Brown said.No arrests have been made and police are continuing to investigate both cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-year-old-killed-in-chicago-drive-by-shooting/story-HWjl682JffyQE4u5VcZViP.html
28-06-2020||World||Iran’s central bank injects cash to stabilise currency market, says bank governor||Iran’s Central Bank has injected hundreds of millions of dollars to stabilise the currency market, bank governor Abdolnaser Hemmati said on Saturday, after the Iranian currency fell to historic lows this week.“Over the past few days, hundreds of millions of dollars entered the market through (Central Bank-linked) brokers and thwarted many of the plans of those trying to destabilise the foreign exchange market,” Hemmati said in an Instagram posting.The rial currency sank to its lowest-ever level on Tuesday before recovering slightly. It has been under pressure from US sanctions and the coronavirus crisis.After saying on Friday that the central bank would not “‘spray’ its resources onto the market”, Hemmati said that he did not mean the bank would hold back from supporting the ailing rial. “Our market intervention will be prudent and goal-oriented,” he said. Iranian officials have said in the past that they have largely abandoned a policy of injecting large amounts of hard currency to support the rial since 2018, when it lost about 75 percent of its value after the United States withdrew from a nuclear deal and re-imposed sanctions. The rial was trading at around 200,000 per US dollar on the unofficial market on Saturday, according to foreign exchange websites including Bonbast.com.The currency gained slightly against the US dollar earlier, trading at around 192,000 per dollar on Friday, after falling to a historic low of 205,000 on Tuesday. The official exchange rate is 42,000 rials per dollar and is used mostly for imports of state-subsidised food and medicine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-s-central-bank-injects-cash-to-stabilise-currency-market-says-bank-governor/story-yCykEXfVsjueMl8TjMIGkK.html
28-06-2020||World||Retirement plans put aside, Russia’s Putin aims to be president till 83||After two decades in power, Vladimir Putin’s approval ratings are at an all-time low as Russia’s economy reels under the impact of the coronavirus epidemic and the slump in oil prices. What better time for him to seek to extend his presidency for potentially 16 more years?It’s a measure of how tightly Putin has controlled the operation to amend Russia’s constitution that there’s little suspense about the result of a referendum on the changes, despite the economic pain unleashed by the virus. Approval in the vote that concludes July 1 will allow him to seek two more six-year terms after his present one ends in 2024, staying in power until 2036, when he’d be 83.Still, amid rising public discontent, officials are pulling out all the stops to ensure a high turnout in a vote Putin wasn’t obliged to call. While a simple majority in favor and a turnout exceeding 50% of eligible voters is all that’s required, the Kremlin won’t be happy with anything less than an overwhelming endorsement. It’s sought to woo Russians with populist sweeteners such as an effective constitutional ban on gay marriage.“People are disenchanted with the ‘presidential republic’ and iron fist they believed in 20 years ago,” said Sergei Belanovsky, a Moscow sociologist who helped to produce polling that predicted the biggest protests of Putin’s rule in 2011-2012 and is now tracking a renewed increase in negative attitudes toward the leadership of the country.Putin caught even many in his inner circle by surprise in January when he announced plans to carry out the most extensive reform of the constitution since it was adopted in 1993. But the clause allowing him to sidestep term limits didn’t appear until March, even if many officials later suspected that had been his plan all along.Putin is already the longest-serving leader of the world’s largest country by landmass since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. After a 2018 backlash over a pension-age increase, the former KGB colonel has found it harder to maintain public support as falling living standards stir increased resentment.His popularity rating at 59% - though still respectable by western standards - is the lowest since he became president in 2000, and has fallen to the level of regional governors whom Putin routinely used to out-poll, according to the Levada Center, an independent pollster in Moscow.Putin, who delegated the main responsibility for combating the spread of Covid-19 to regional chiefs, has seen his ratings fall because of people’s unhappiness at the current economic crisis, said Levada analyst Denis Volkov. At the same time, the authorities for now remain in greater control than they were at the time of the mass demonstrations almost a decade ago with most Russians still hopeful the country will emerge from the crisis, he said.After years of stagnation, Russia’s economy may shrink by 6.6% this year, the worst contraction since 2009 in the wake of the global financial crisis, according to the International Monetary Fund. Growth has averaged under 2% in the past decade, far down on the more than 7% annual expansion that helped incomes soar during Putin’s first two terms as president. The Russian central bank sees little room for improvement in coming years without structural reform.Real incomes are falling after stagnating over the past six years, while unemployment climbed to 6.1% in May from 4.7% in March.Putin stirred patriotic sentiments before the referendum with a massive military parade in Red Square on June 24 to mark the 75th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, a commemoration delayed by the virus from May 9. He also sought to win over ordinary Russians on the eve of the vote by unveiling fresh cash payments for families and the unemployed and a tax increase for the rich.Levada’s latest poll conducted late last month showed fewer than half of people support the constitutional reform. State employees are being pressured into voting, according to election monitoring group Golos, which said that the use of large-scale online voting for the first time and the week-long balloting process made it harder for independent observers to uncover any violations.State pollster VTsIOM puts support for Putin at a much higher level, reporting trust in the president ranging between 66% and 73% in 2020. It published a June 23 forecast showing between 67% and 71% of voters will back the amendments in the referendum.Sense of SecurityThe authorities’ calculation is that people, whatever their reservations, will mostly rally behind at a time of national crisis out of recognition that the government offers a sense of security, said an official with knowledge of Kremlin political planning.Belanovsky, the sociologist, said his most recent research of public opinion conducted this month shows that a majority supports aspects of the constitutional changes aimed at upholding traditional values but only a minority backs Putin’s wish to reset his term limits to zero at the end of his current mandate.Interviews with focus groups from March to May have pointed to a sharp sense of disillusionment both with the president personally and the government as a whole, according to Belanovsky. People are angry about falling living standards, corruption and a lack of help from the authorities to counter the economic fall-out of the lockdown during the pandemic, he said.VTsIOM’s head Valery Fyodorov dismissed Belanovsky’s research as “pseudo-polling” that is “not based on scientific sampling” in a commentary on Wednesday.Putin’s rule has become “far less legitimate,” according to Tatiana Stanovaya, head of R. Politik, a political consultancy. “Social dissatisfaction is building up, but we won’t see the consequences until later.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/retirement-plans-put-aside-russia-s-putin-aims-to-be-president-till-83/story-PuB9lmmv2L4anOdaQ4qzSO.html

The Russian aircraft did not enter US or Canadian sovereign airspace, NORAD said.The intercepting aircraft are based at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska, said a NORAD spokesman, Captain Cameron Hillier.The incident is one of a series of back-and-forth probes by Russia and the United States this year. On June 19, Russia scrambled fighter jets to intercept two U.S. B-52 bombers flying over the Sea of Okhotsk, off Russia’s far eastern coast, the Interfax news agency reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/norad-fighter-jets-intercept-russian-military-aircraft-off-alaska/story-LANQ6E4mIFQCiHr3mkRF2H.html
28-06-2020||World||What doctors have learned about fighting Covid-19||In the six months since an entirely new coronavirus began spreading around the world, doctors and hospitals have learned a lot about how to treat patients with Covid-19, the potentially deadly disease caused by the virus.What doctors have learned about fighting Covid-19:• Patients are at increased risk of blood clots, and blood thinning agents can help.• “Proning” - putting patients on their stomachs to relieve pressure on the lungs - can stave off the need for mechanical ventilation.• Besides the respiratory system and lungs, the coronavirus can attack many other organs, including the heart, liver, kidneys, and brain.• The most promising treatments so far seem to be the anti-viral remdesivir; dexamethasone, a steroid to treat the body’s inflammatory response to Covid-19; and plasma donated by patients who have antibodies to the disease.• More widespread testing and quicker results helps relieve pressure on hospitals.• Information-sharing among health professionals worldwide is crucial.• Prevention is critical. Doctors are relying on the public to do their part with good hygiene, masks and social distancing.Some of the biggest unknowns:• Exactly which treatments will work for which patients.• How quickly some treatments will gain widespread distribution, especially remdesivir.• How long it will take for Covid-19 patients to recover.• The long-term effects of the infection.“If the best lesson we’ve learned is to turn patients onto their stomachs instead of their backs,” said Valory Wangler, chief medical officer at Rehoboth McKinley Christian Health Care Services, in Gallup, New Mexico, “it means we’re far from a miracle cure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-doctors-have-learned-about-fighting-covid-19/story-zyUEQdQWwgqtbKHcJbGD8L.html

28-06-2020||World||Princeton dumps Woodrow Wilson’s name over ‘racist thinking’||Princeton University is removing Woodrow Wilson’s name from its public policy school and one of its residential colleges after trustees concluded that the 28th US president’s “racist thinking and policies” made him “an inappropriate namesake.”The Ivy League school’s trustees made the decision Friday, according to a statement released on Saturday.It comes at a time of widespread rethinking of America’s racial legacy. The Black Lives Matter movement, energized by a series of high-profile deaths of Black Americans, have resulted in the removal of Confederate monuments, flags, and symbols of racism across the US. Deleting Wilson’s name at Princeton may be the most high-profile act to date. The policy school will now be known as “The Princeton School of Public and International Affairs.”Wilson was president of Princeton from 1902 to 1910 and, as a Democrat, served as governor of New Jersey before winning the 1912 presidential election. Wilson, born in Virginia in 1856, spent his early years in the South, including in Georgia and South Carolina.“Wilson’s racism was significant and consequential, even by the standards of his own time,” Princeton President Christopher L. Eisgruber said in the statement.Civil Service“He segregated the federal civil service after it had been racially integrated for decades, thereby taking America backward in its pursuit of justice,” he added. “He not only acquiesced in but added to the persistent practice of racism in this country, a practice that continues to do harm today.”Princeton established its School of Public and International Affairs in 1930, in the spirit of Wilson’s interest in preparing students for leadership. It was named in honor of Wilson in 1948, according to the Princeton website.Wilson’s “Fourteen Points” speech to Congress in 1918 laid down a statement of principles for peace later used to end World War One. He was known for his role in the Paris Peace Conference, the signing of the Treaty of Versailles that ended war between Germany and the Allied Powers, and establishment of the post-war League of Nations.During his first term in office, Wilson oversaw the creation of the modern U.S. central bank, signing the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.Fraught HistoryChartered in 1746, Princeton says it is the fourth-oldest college in the US. It’s been led by only 20 presidents, dating back to Colonial times. It’s also among the richest colleges.As one of America’s oldest universities, Princeton has a fraught history with race and gender. It admitted its first black undergraduates in 1945, decades after other Ivy League schools. It didn’t accept women as undergrads until 1969 -- and even then, did so over opposition from some alumni.Former First Lady Michelle Obama, one of the school’s most well-known Black alumus, recalled Princeton as “extremely white and very male” in her autobiography, “Becoming.”“If in high school I’d felt as if I were representing my neighborhood, now at Princeton I was representing my race,” she wrote. “Anytime I found my voice in class or nailed an exam, I quietly hoped it helped make a larger point.”The university had discussed removing Wilson’s name before, following student protests at the New Jersey school in November 2015. At the time, a committee that studied Wilson’s legacy at Princeton decided to retain the name.Princeton student and alumni interest in the issue has persisted, and the trustees returned to the subject this month as the U.S. struggled profoundly with the injustice of racism, the university said in its statement.Kudos to All“As a Princeton alumni, I am THRILLED,” Keisha Blain, president of the African American Intellectual History Society, said on Twitter. “Kudos to the courageous faculty, students, and staff.”Student activists renewed their effort to call for removal of Woodrow Wilson’s name in recent weeks, as BLM protests took on a global scale, sparking changes across corporations, governments, the sports world and beyond. Two groups of students at the school this week submitted demands for anti-racist action to administrators.“This question has been made more urgent by the recent killings of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, and Rayshard Brooks, which have served as tragic reminders of the ongoing need for all of us to stand against racism and for equality and justice,” the trustees said. “Our commitment to those values must be clear and unequivocal.”Protest organizers said changing the name was only “one small part” of their demands, and urged more “transformative change” at the school.New Diplomas?Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson, who holds a master’s degree from the public policy school, applauded the decision on Twitter and asked, “will we be getting new diplomas.”The U.S. is seeing a paradigm shift in what’s acceptable in terms of public memorialization and representation, said Leslie Harris, a professor of history at Northwestern University.Harris added, “I am concerned that this decision was made only after the loss of Black life through extraordinary violence, rather than through reasoned discussion and debate, which is supposedly the hallmark of the university.”“Nothing has changed in Woodrow Wilson’s record in the interim between which the university decided to keep the name, and today’s decision,” said Harris, whose research includes the history of US slavery.Eric Yellin, an associate professor at the University of Richmond, said Princeton “is trying to signal that it wants to be a place where students of color and historically marginalized students feel at home.”“I don’t know what it means for reality on the ground for students of color at Princeton -- for Black students in particular. There’s a long history of finding Princeton a difficult place to be,” said Yellin, the author of “Racism in the Nation’s Service: Government Workers and the Color Line in Woodrow Wilson’s America.” “It certainly is a powerful signal of an intent to make change.”Trustees at another New Jersey school, Monmouth University in West Long Branch, voted this month to remove Wilson’s name from its marquee building. It’s unclear how Princeton’s decision may affect other institutions in the US that bear Wilson’s name, including high schools and elementary schools in several states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/princeton-dumps-woodrow-wilson-s-name-over-racist-thinking/story-9RTtg9h4LlJdIStCw4D4wJ.html
28-06-2020||World||Polish presidential poll could reshape relations with EU and domestic agenda||Poland holds a closely-fought presidential election on Sunday that could reshape its tense relationship with the EU and determine the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government’s ability to make progress on its socially conservative agenda.Incumbent Andrzej Duda, 48, has vowed to be a guardian of PiS’s economic programmes, which include generous social spending, and its pledge to safeguard traditional family values in the predominantly Catholic country.“We don’t see the same standard of living as in western Europe and this is what I would like to achieve,” Duda said in the southwestern town of Rybnik on Friday during one of his last campaign stops before the election, delayed by seven weeks due to the coronavirus pandemic.A PiS ally, Duda has rejected some Western influences including sexual education programmes that he says can perpetuate “LGBT ideology”, which he argues is worse than communism.His main challenger, centrist Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, also 48, seeks to provide a progressive alternative, promising to fight Poland’s isolation in the EU after five years of conflict between the government and Brussels.Since PiS came to power in 2015, the European Commission, the EU executive, has launched an unprecedented legal action against Warsaw following criticism that Poland is subverting democratic norms by politicising its courts.SECOND ROUNDAs mayor, Trzaskowski has proposed sexual education programmes in line with World Health Organization recommendations for schools, a move criticised by PiS as an effort to sexualise children.Polling stations open at 7.00 a.m. (0500 GMT) and close at 9.00 p.m., when exit polls will be published. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the votes, the two with the biggest share will compete in a second round on July 12.Poland imposes an “election silence” starting at midnight the day before the election which bans discussing opinion polls and campaigning.Poland’s presidency carries some responsibilities in defense and foreign affairs as well as the right to veto legislation.If Duda fails to secure a second five-year mandate, his successor could hamper the government’s ability to deepen its justice reforms by vetoing laws or refusing to nominate judges picked by PiS allies.This would likely fuel tensions within PiS’ fragile parliamentary coalition and could force the government of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki to govern as a minority cabinet. An early national election can’t be ruled out.Nine other candidates are competing, including independent Catholic journalist Szymon Holownia, leftist Robert Biedron - Poland’s most prominent openly gay politician - and Krzysztof Bosak of the far-right Confederation party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/polish-presidential-poll-could-reshape-relations-with-eu-and-domestic-agenda/story-IkYih6e9R2DPybvO98cWJO.html
28-06-2020||World||1 fatally shot at Breonna Taylor protest park in Kentucky||Authorities were investigating a fatal shooting Saturday night at a park in downtown Louisville, Kentucky, where demonstrators had gathered to protest the death of Breonna Taylor.Reports of shots fired at Jefferson Square Park came in around 9 p.m., Louisville Metro police said in a statement, followed by calls that the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department was performing life-saving measures on a male who died at the scene. Shortly after, police were told of a shooting victim across the street at the Hall of Justice. That person was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries.Video posted on social media appeared to show a man opening fire into the park as people scrambled for cover. The footage later showed at least one person bleeding profusely on the ground.Officers cleared the park and police “are trying to gather as much information as possible in order to identify all who were involved in the incident,” the statement said. No information about arrests, possible suspects and the victims’ identities and ages was immediately released. Officials did not immediately release additional information.The park has for weeks been the epicenter for protests in the city after the police killings of Taylor and George Floyd. The Saturday night shooting was at least the second during nearly a month of protests in Louisville over Taylor’s death. Seven people were wounded May 28 when gunfire erupted near City Hall, prompting a statement from Taylor’s mother asking people to demand justice “without hurting each other.”“Praying for our city,” tweeted Kentucky state Rep. Charles Booker of Louisville late Saturday. The Democrat is running for his party’s nomination to challenge Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell in the fall.Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was killed in her Louisville home in March by police who were serving a no-knock warrant. Protesters have been calling for the officers involved in her death to be charged. One of the officers was recently fired.Kenneth Walker, Taylor’s boyfriend, was originally charged with attempted murder after he fired a shot at one of the officers who came into the home. Walker has said he thought he was defending from an intruder.The no-knock search warrant that allows police to enter without first announcing their presence was recently banned by Louisville’s Metro Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-fatally-shot-at-breonna-taylor-protest-park-in-kentucky/story-9vSfPqF80pGg91NzrTQ5EM.html

The 36-year-old had been put into a coma having contracted the novel coronavirus, which left her lungs barely able cope.Doctors performed a caesarian section due to the state of her lungs and Jefferson was born at least 14 weeks prematurely.The case generated “a lot of shock,” Paula Velasquez, a doctor specializing in internal medicine at the Versalles clinic in the southeastern city of Cali, told AFP.“We knew that there were few reported cases of survival in a context as severe as our patient,” said Velasquez.Angola, who also has a daughter, was taken to hospital on May 15 with a terrible fever.Three days later she was put into an induced coma and kept that way until surgery.Because of her pregnancy, she was kept sitting up at a 45 degree angle, when those suffering from pneumonia are normally laid down flat to help their breathing.Jefferson, though premature, was born without the coronavirus -- but doctors said he struggled to breathe, and that they had to revive him.“We had to go through the whole procedure of a critical patient,” pediatrician Edwin Olivo, who was one of the specialists involved in the birth, said.But, he added, though the baby remains in an incubator he quickly started putting on weight and breathing more easily.“A human being can survive from 24 weeks with a good weight, but with a lot of technology and an effect on neurological development and the lungs,” said Velasquez.Painful memoriesNow recovered from the virus, Angola is desperate to be discharged with her son.“It’s really emotional knowing that we fought, that the doctors helped us survive,” she said, her voice faint.She says she doesn’t know how she contracted the virus and her family insists she complied rigidly with the lockdown, first imposed on March 25 but which has been easing recently.In the hospital corridors, her sister Angela breathes a sigh of relief.Hospitals bring back painful memories: two years ago her mother and another sister died in intensive care, where Diana was for several weeks.Angela remembers her sister screaming: “Don’t let them put me on artificial ventilation, get me out of here, I don’t want to die,” after doctors told her what treatment they were proposing.With Latin America now the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, Angela wants her sister and nephew’s case to act as a lesson for others.“There are many people who go around without face masks, who go to parties, because they don’t know anyone (with the virus) they don’t realize” how dangerous it is.With more than 2,600 deaths and 80,000 cases, Colombia is the sixth most affected country in Latin America in terms of fatalities and fifth worst for infections.However, the virus is spreading quickly in the country of 50 million, with a quarter of those deaths and cases reported just last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colombian-woman-with-covid-19-gives-birth-to-non-infected-child-in-coma/story-JHJowO6PxjDP7UlvxkiWxN.html

Gen. Amir Haskel, remained in detention for refusing the police’s release terms and insisting on participating in Saturday’s protest, Israeli media reported.Last month, Netanyahu’s trial on charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes opened in a Jerusalem court. It is scheduled to resume next month.Netanyahu’s new government took office last month, ending more than a year of political stalemate.Under a power sharing deal, Netanyahu was permitted to remain as prime minister, while his rival, Benny Gantz, was named defence minister and alternate prime minister.The two men have agreed to switch posts after 18 months, though many analysts do not expect the government to last that long.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crime-minister-hundreds-of-israelis-protest-in-jerusalem-against-netanyahu/story-59EghcflpapEM7w1OKk5fM.html

But more recently, presidential aides have been playing down expectations.In the capital, the election’s biggest prize, the sitting socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo is on track for a comfortable win after a shambolic campaign by Macron and his La Republique en Marche (LaRem) party.Meanwhile, the Greens are projected to do well in cities such as Lyon, Marseille and Bordeaux, sometimes in alliance with the Left, building on momentum they created in 2019’s European elections. In Perpignan, Marine Le Pen’s far-right party may take control of its first city with a population over 100,000.France pressed ahead with the first round of the municipal elections in mid-March, less than 48 hours before Macron imposed one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns, forcing a long delay before the second round.“We’ll be careful. We can always bring our own pen, wear a mask and use sanitizer gel,” remarked Paris pensioner Christian Courtot.Macron has said he will “reinvent” his presidency and present a detailed plan next month for the final two years of his mandate.A government reshuffle is widely expected, with the biggest question-mark over the future of Macron’s popular prime minister, Edouard Philippe. Philippe is running for his old job as mayor of Le Havre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-returns-to-polls-for-municipal-elections-prez-macron-faces-drubbing/story-Klg2vdTsxdCywlgKfsAafL.html
28-06-2020||World||Global coronavirus cases exceed 10 million||Global coronavirus cases exceeded 10 million on Sunday according to a Reuters tally, marking a major milestone in the spread of the respiratory disease that has so far killed almost half a million people in seven months. The figure is roughly double the number of severe influenza illnesses recorded annually, according to the World Health Organisation.The milestone comes as many hard-hit countries are easing lockdowns while making extensive alterations to work and social life that could last for a year or more until a vaccine is available. Some countries are experiencing a resurgence in infections, leading authorities to partially reinstate lockdowns, in what experts say could be a recurring pattern in the coming months and into 2021. North America, Latin America and Europe each account for around 25% of cases, while Asia and the Middle East have around 11% and 9% respectively, according to the Reuters tally, which uses government reports. There have been more than 497,000 fatalities linked to the disease so far, roughly the same as the number of influenza deaths reported annually.The first cases of the new coronavirus were confirmed on Jan. 10 in Wuhan in China, before infections and fatalities surged in Europe, then the United States, and later Russia. The pandemic has now entered a new phase, with India and Brazil battling outbreaks of over 10,000 cases a day, putting a major strain on resources. The two countries accounted for over a third of all new cases in the past week. Brazil reported a record 54,700 new cases on June 19. Some researchers said the death toll in Latin America could rise to over 380,000 by October, from around 100,000 this week.The total number of cases continued to increase at a rate of between 1-2% a day in the past week, down from rates above 10% in March. Countries including China, New Zealand and Australia have seen new outbreaks in the past month, despite largely quashing local transmission.In Beijing, where hundreds of new cases were linked to an agricultural market, testing capacity has been ramped up to 300,000 a day. The United States, which has reported the most cases of any country at more than 2.5 million, managed to slow the spread of the virus in May, only to see it expand in recent weeks to rural areas and other places that were previously unaffected.In some countries with limited testing capabilities, case numbers reflect a small proportion of total infections.

Two people in Garcia Harfuch’s security detail died, along with a woman who was driving to work, the mayor said.Garcia Harfuch was rushed into surgery after being shot in the shoulder, collarbone and knee. He was recovering Saturday, with “more energy than ever,” Sheinbaum said in a briefing Saturday on her Twitter account. She later posted a photo of him smiling from his hospital bed.A powerful drug cartel has been accused of trying to assassinate the city’s top cop, marking a new escalation in the years-long war between the government and organized crime.Garcia Harfuch also said in a tweet he’s recovering well and urged the city to continue working to maintain security and peace.The bloody confrontation turned the normally quiet street into a war zone, with shattered glass littering the ground and an SUV riddled with bullet holes. As police tried to make sense of exactly what happened, details emerged adding to the mystery, including that the attack may have been foretold in intercepted phone calls and a recent newspaper column. Federal Public Security Minister Alfonso Durazo confirmed that threats had been made and said in a press conference that initial information points to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.“The Jalisco cartel has become public enemy No. 1,” said Falko Ernst, a researcher at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based NGO for conflict resolution. “This administration didn’t want to engage in open warfare, but it isn’t being left up to them.”Garcia Harfuch was attacked by as many as 28 gunmen, and sniper rifles and grenades were confiscated on the scene, said Ulises Lara, a spokesman for the city’s Attorney General’s Office. Authorities arrested 12 suspects shortly after the attack and a total of 19 people were detained by the end of the day, including the intellectual authors, Sheinbaum said.President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is facing increased pressure to change his national security policies to crack down on worsening violence. The president, who is known as AMLO, emphasizes economic development over heavy-handed law enforcement as the only long-term solution. But he’s also been criticized for militarizing the country’s policing through the newly created National Guard without a plan to deal with underlying corruption.On Saturday, Lopez Obrador said he would not “declare war on anyone” in response to the attack.“We’re not going to violate human rights. We’re not going to permit massacres,” he said in a video posted to Twitter. “But we’re going to act and prevent these attacks from being committed, and we’re not going to make any agreements with organized crime like before.”Brookings Institution security expert Vanda Felbab-Brown said the attack represented a “massive tactical failure” by the government given that officials had been threatened. She compared the attack in the capital, which had been off limits before in the country’s drug war, to when Colombia’s kingpins took on the government with targeted assassinations.“This is going to be a wake up call to get serious about violent crime,” Felbab-Brown said. “It may be too late.”El Universal columnist Raul Rodriguez Cortes wrote last week that the government had intercepted calls by organized crime groups, which said they were planning to target a top official. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency confirmed the calls were legitimate, Cortes said. Mexico then beefed up the security on four top officials that the cartel had reason to target, including Garcia Harfuch, Foreign Affairs Minister Marcelo Ebrard, head of the Financial Intelligence Unit Santiago Nieto and Durazo.Jalisco New Generation, known by its Spanish acronym CJNG, is infamous for extreme violence and was responsible for one of the nation’s deadliest attacks on security forces, when 15 police officers were killed in an ambush in 2015. The U.S. has offered a $10 million bounty on information leading to the capture of the group’s leader, Nemesio Oseguera Ramos -- better known by his alias El Mencho.Military-Style AmbushesWhile military-style ambushes and gunfights are common throughout Mexico, it’s rare that the bloodshed spills over into the capital city. Cartels have been escalating their attacks in recent months and some experts point to the extradition of El Mencho’s son to the U.S. in February as one catalyst. This week, a car loaded with explosives was seized by authorities in the vicinity of a refinery in the central state of Guanajuato.Earlier this month, a federal judge and his wife were killed in the state of Colima. In October, Mexican Forces were overpowered by members of Sinaloa Cartel as they attempted to take in the son of Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, the world’s most notorious drug lord. And in November, at least nine members of a Mormon family, all U.S. citizens, were killed in northern Mexico in a suspected attack by cartels.Three police officers were wounded in Friday’s confrontation, which broke out in the neighborhood of Lomas de Chapultepec at a little past 6:30 a.m. and was caught on cameras. Residents reported hearing rapid-fire shots that lasted almost a full minute. The attackers arrived in trucks, including one that bore the Grupo Carso logo. Carso, a Mexican conglomerate founded by billionaire Carlos Slim, said in a statement that the truck didn’t belong to the company.Cross-Country TourOn Friday, AMLO was wrapping up a cross-country tour that started June 1 and held his morning press conference in Morelia, in Michoacan state. AMLO often travels and goes to events without security.“The president has decided to operate under a model of no security,” Durazo said in the press conference. “We are trying to look after his safety, regardless of his tours.”According to researchers at InSight Crime, the cartel is rapidly expanding and has contacts throughout the U.S. and Latin America. It primarily sells marijuana, cocaine and synthetic drugs.Morning AMLO: Homicides Rise 8% in April From Year Earlier“This comes after a wave of other concerning attacks that we’ve seen since last year,” said Maureen Meyer, Mexico director at the think tank Washington Office on Latin America. Recent attacks suggest Lopez Obrador’s strategy “hasn’t put a dent in the violence.”(Updates with president’s comments in 10th and 11th paragraphs)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-city-s-police-chief-recovering-from-bullet-wounds-in-cartel-ambush/story-JXH9d4NI73V52MZgajqrMJ.html

The newspaper reported that Islamist militants, or armed criminal elements closely associated with them, were believed to have collected some bounty money.Trump was told about the intelligence but had not authorized steps to retaliate, the Times reported.Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate set to challenge Trump in the Nov. 3 election, said during a virtual town hall on Saturday that the Times report, if true, represents a “truly shocking revelation,” noting in particular Trump’s reported failure to retaliate.“Not only has he failed to sanction or impose any kind of consequences on Russia for this egregious violation of international law, Donald Trump has continued his embarrassing campaign of deference and debasing himself before Vladimir Putin,” Biden said, referring to the Russian president.Biden pledged retaliation if he becomes president.“If I’m elected president, make no mistake about it, Vladimir Putin will be confronted and we’ll impose serious costs on Russia,” Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-trump-did-nothing-as-russia-placed-bounties-on-us-army-personnel/story-9BVcv8aanUtsZnDZQsjwsN.html

The attack happened June 20 at Forbury Gardens park in Reading, a town of 200,000 people some 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of London.The three victims, friends who were identified by police as teacher James Furlong, 36, scientist David Wails, 49, and pharmaceutical worker Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, 39, were enjoying a warm Saturday evening at the park when they were stabbed. Police said Friday that each man had received a single fatal blow.Three other people also were wounded and have since been released from the hospital. Police declared the stabbings as a terrorist incident the day after the attack, but they have not said what they think the motive was and noted the investigating is ongoing.The local Reading Borough Council has organized an online vigil later Saturday for the three friends.Britain’s Press Association reported that Furlong’s family released a statement Saturday thanking other park-goers and police officers who rushed to help the wounded men.“James was passionate about creating a more loving and caring society. His time with us was cut far too short but the impact he made will live on, long long into the future,” the new agency quoted the statement as saying.Saadallah is due to appear in court on Monday.

28-06-2020||India||Beating Covid, lifting economy our two main goals, says Modi||Defeating the coronavirus disease and strengthening the economy should be the two focal points as India gradually lifts restrictions on movement and activities, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday, appealing to people to remain vigilant, use masks and follow social distancing rules to contain the spread of Covid-19.“...the country has moved out of the lockdown phase to the unlock phase. During this unlock period, one will have to focus deeply on two points — defeating corona and strengthening the economy and bolstering it...,” Modi, who has earlier spoken of striking a balance between lives and livelihood, said in his monthly radio address Mann Ki Baat. “Only your alertness can save you from corona. Always remember, if you do not wear a mask, do not observe the two-yard social distancing norms or do not take other precautions, you are putting others at risk besides yourselves, especially the elderly and children at home...,” he told the countrymen at a time the country is witnessing a steady rise in fresh infections.India recorded 19,541 fresh cases on Sunday. 16,481 people have died in the country due to the infection.After 68 days of lockdown since March 25, India entered the “Unlock 1” phase in June, allowing the resumption of shopping malls, dine-in restaurants and religious places. Before that, the government allowed the gradual opening of shops, and partial passenger railway services and domestic air travel. A call is expected on the reopening of educational institutes in July in the second phase. And in the third phase, the government will decide on resuming international air travel, cinema halls, gyms, swimming pools, bars, and auditoriums, among others.While releasing the guidelines for “Unlock 1” in May-end, the government said the plan will have an “economic focus” as it looked to bring stalled businesses back on track and bolster the third largest economy in Asia, which is in the grip of a slowdown due to the impact of Covid-19 and the lockdown prompted by the pandemic. “...during this unlock phase, many other things are getting unlocked, which had hitherto, shackled the country for decades,” Modi said, referring to the reform measures his government has okayed in the fields of agriculture, space, mining, and other sectors.Not just the pandemic, he said, the country has had to face several other challenges in the recent times. “A few days ago, our east coast had to face the fury of cyclone Amphan; on the west coast, it was cyclone Nisarga. In many states, farmers had to bear the brunt of swarming locusts... many parts of the country have been witnessing intermittent earthquakes,” Modi added. But he stressed that India always transformed adversities into stepping stones to success. “...For centuries, myriad tyrants invaded India, pushing her to the edge of such an abyss of adversities that people once used to feel that the very idea, the fabric of Bharat would be wiped out: her culture would be annihilated. But India overcame the scourge, and more gloriously so,” Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/beating-covid-lifting-economy-our-two-main-goals-says-modi/story-s9xUcLshgTB6R3U8YPrFsJ.html
28-06-2020||India||Eyeing our land earns a befitting reply: Modi||India honours the spirit of friendship but those who have “cast an evil eye” on its territory received a befitting response, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday, remarks that came in the backdrop of a simmering border dispute with China that has strained ties between the two Asian powerhouses.In his monthly radio address Mann Ki Baat, Modi also paid tributes to the 20 Indian Army soldiers who died in a violent brawl with Chinese troops along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley, and said the country is capable of giving an appropriate response to any adversary.“Our brave soldiers have proven that they will not let anyone cast an evil eye on the glory and honour of Mother India,” Modi said without naming China. He stressed that India’s way of life inspires “one and all to serve selflessly”, but at the same time, the country was committed to safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity.Tensions have peaked on the border in the aftermath of the June 15 skirmish, the first deadly conflict between Indian and Chinese soldiers along the LAC in 45 years. According to India’s assessment, the casualties suffered by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) were twice the deaths on the Indian side. Beijing has not disclosed the number of soldiers it lost.In his radio address, Modi said: “...the entire country comes together in paying tributes to the bravery of our jawans who attained martyrdom in Ladakh. The entire country bows to them in reverence, with gratitude. Just like their family members, every Indian painfully regrets the loss.” He added that India, which is facing multiple challenges including the coronavirus disease pandemic, cyclones and locust attacks, also has had to “deal with the designs of some of our neighbours”.The Prime Minister also appealed to citizens to use indigenously made products, saying being “vocal for local” is also a way to strengthen the country and to serve it. Modi said India’s aim is to become self-reliant, its tradition is trust and friendship, and its spirit is brotherhood. “We will keep moving ahead abiding by these principles,” he said.“A self-reliant India would be a tribute to our martyrs in the truest, deepest sense.”In May, the government announced a ₹20-lakh-crore welfare package to boost the economy and make India “self-reliant” in the face of the disruptions triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. In his radio address, Modi referred to a woman from Assam, who, he said, wrote that she has resolved to buy only local products after watching the developments in eastern Ladakh. “I am receiving messages on these lines from every corner of the country,” Modi said.Amid the border face-off with China, clamour to boycott Chinese goods has been growing. Backers of the move say this will hurt the neighbouring country economically. An analysis of the World Bank’s World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) database by HT on February 15 showed Chinese imports had an average share of almost 40% in India’s total capital goods imports, one-fifth of consumer goods imports, and 15% of intermediate goods imports. The analysis was based on import data from 2014 to 2018.In his address, Modi said that before Independence, India’s defence sector was ahead of that in many countries. “There used to be a multitude of ordnance factories. Many countries that lagged behind us then, are ahead of us now. After independence, we should have made efforts in the defence sector, taking advantage of our prior experience… we did not. But today, in the fields of defence and technology, India is relentlessly endeavouring to advance on those fronts… India is taking strides towards self-reliance,” he said.The opposition Congress party, which has been unsparing in its criticism of the government’s handling of the border situation, took a fresh dig at the Prime Minister. “In 33 minutes of Mann ki Baat, he did not take the name of China even once. Why is the PM afraid of China?” the Congress’s chief spokesperson, Randeep Singh Surjewala, said.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi, too, questioned the Prime Minister over his “18 meetings” with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the last six years. “I implore the Prime Minister to say China is an aggressor,” he said.While the Congress says the government has not come clean on the border situation and ceded ground to China, the Centre accuses the principal opposition party of politicising an issue of strategic interest.Both India and China have significantly reinforced their deployments with fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, heavy artillery and missile systems in the region that has garnered extensive global attention in recent weeks, particularly after the bloodshed along the LAC.Senior Indian and Chinese military commanders reached a consensus on disengaging from friction points along the LAC on June 22. However, China has not halted — and instead ramped up — its military activities in Galwan Valley, Depsang sector and the Finger Area near Pangong Tso, according to satellite images.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eyeing-our-land-earns-a-befitting-reply-modi/story-g5OSwTZfK4VbfgFHynViKJ.html
28-06-2020||India||Tabloid owner accused of rape, trafficking held||Bhopal/Indore: Jitendra alias Jitu Soni, 62, the owner of a tabloid accused of rape, blackmail, extortion, human trafficking, land grab, was arrested from Gujarat on Sunday after remaining on the run for seven months, the Madhya Pradesh police said.Deputy inspector general Harinarayanchari Mishra said of the 64 criminal cases, Soni, an Indore resident, faces, 47 have been lodged over the last six months. He added a local court has remained Soni in police custody for interrogation.Soni had been on the run since escaping during a police raid in December after Harbhajan Singh, an Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) engineer, filed a case against the tabloid owner for defaming him based on “unfounded conversation” and for trying to blackmail him.The tabloid published a transcript of the engineer’s alleged conversation with certain women arrested on charges of luring, trapping, and blackmailing high-profile people in states like Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. It also carried transcripts of purported conversations of two other high-profile people, including a former minister.Indore inspector general Vivek Sharma said six police teams carried out raids at several places to track Soni over the last six months. He added Soni was eventually arrested from his ancestral Dhargni village in Gujarat’s Amreli district when he was about to change his location. Sharma said Soni kept moving from one place to another in Maharashtra and Gujarat. “He has had a criminal history since 1991.” He added there was a Rs 1.50 lakh reward for information leading to his arrest.Sharma said Soni has primarily been arrested in connection with the case filed against him in December. “So far, Soni’s son, Amit Soni, and brother, Mahendra Soni, have been arrested. His other brother Hukum Soni, son Vikki Soni, nephews Jignesh Soni and Lucky Soni, four other members of his family, and 25 other accomplices are yet to be arrested.”IMC and police razed Soni’s two bungalows in Indore and removed illegal structures at his two hotels and a cafe in December as part of an anti-encroachment drive. The demolition began on December 5 when police claimed to have rescued 67 women and several children from the hotel and arrested Amit Soni, his bouncer, and several members of their staff.The Indore administration has cancelled the permission granted to Soni to bring out his daily.(With input from Neha Jain in Indore)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tabloid-owner-accused-of-rape-trafficking-held/story-MfgDOBtIiQEis1BqNVekpI.html
28-06-2020||India||Cong leaders told to intensify protests over fuel prices rise||New Delhi: The Congress has asked its leaders and workers to pull bullock carts, ride cycles, interview taxi drivers and post their comments on social media during the week-long nationwide agitation from Monday against the “unprecedented and continuous” increase in petrol and diesel prices.In a circular, Congress general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal asked them to register a strong protest against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government at the Centre through demonstrations against the “extortionate increase” in fuel rates when people face “unprecedented” economic challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Prices of petrol have been increased by Rs 9.12 paise per litre and diesel by Rs 11.01 a litre since June 7. The price revision was paused for a day on Wednesday after the 17th rate increase in a row. The next day, the price was raised by 16 paise per litre.Petrol is now selling in Delhi at Rs 80.38 per litre and diesel at Rs 80.40 a litre. Retail rates of auto fuels differ from city to city across the country due to variations in local levies.The Congress has been attacking the government over the continuous increase in petrol and diesel prices since the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions were relaxed this month.“It is highly desired that innovative and captivating events like pulling bullock carts, riding bicycles, etc can be held at some of the places in states and Union territories,” Venugopal said in the circular, a copy of which HT has seen.BJP leaders and workers across the country protested against the fuel price increase in 2011 by riding cycles, rickshaws and even pulling bullock during Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) rule.Venugopal also asked Congress leaders and workers to actively participate in the online campaign titled – ‘Speak up on petroleum products’. “It is strongly advised that leaders and workers may conduct interviews by seeking opinions of the common people, including taxi/auto drivers, Uber/Ola drivers, farmers and daily workers and upload the same on social media platforms,” said Venugopal.According to the Indian Oil Company’s website, total taxes on petrol and diesel are more than their basic rates. The basic rate of petrol in Delhi was Rs 22.11 a litre on June 16.Taxes on the fuel (both central excise and state levies) were Rs 50.69 a litre of which central taxes accounted for Rs 32.98. Similarly, the basic price of diesel was Rs 22.93 per litre, but total taxes levied on the fuel were Rs 49.43 per litre, with central taxes accounting for Rs 31.83.Almost all states have raised the value-added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel since mid-March. The Delhi government raised VAT on petrol and diesel to 30% on May 5. Consequently, retail prices of petrol in the state jumped by Rs 1.67 per litre and diesel by Rs 7.10 a litre. Earlier, the state levies on petrol and diesel were 27% and 16.75%. Diesel in Delhi also attracts an additional Rs 250 per kilolitre air ambience charge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-leaders-told-to-intensify-protests-over-fuel-prices-rise/story-YBACrEIxXzJYGfwWOj2qSK.html

28-06-2020||India||India, Japan hold naval exercises||Indian and Japanese warships conducted exercises in the Indian Ocean on Saturday, both navies announced. The Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force described the manoeuvres as designed to “promote mutual understanding” and consisted of four warships, two from each country. Naval exercises are now routine between India and Japan, but the timing of the present exercise will be bracketed with the military stand-off between India and China in Ladakh. Vice-Admiral Pradeep Chauhan, director-general of the National Maritime Foundation, said: “We are using the exercises for strategic communications.” The navies were “not there for combat purposes but for signalling,” he added. “We need to be proximate with our friends and the Chinese know there is a direct ladder of escalation between Japan and the United States.” The Indian navy training vessels, INS Rana and INS Kulush, were joined by the Japanese navy’s JS Kashima and JS Shimayuki. The Japanese embassy in New Delhi said this was the 15th such exercise in three years. “The content of this exercise is tactical training and communications training,” said embassy spokesperson Toshihide Ando, “with no specific scenario”. The Japanese navy has become one of the principal partners of the Indian Navy. Indian naval ships exercise both bilaterally with their Japanese counterparts and as part of the Malabar Exercises, which include the United States. Chauhan noted Indian Army deployments were “sector specific” but India needed to apply pressure across military theatres. Exercises like these remind Beijing that Indian military can quickly deny air cover for Chinese naval assets in the Indian Ocean – and that such plans are ready. “They are still far away from deploying a carrier in the Indian Ocean,” he added.Japan was one of the few countries who publicly supported India during the Doklam crisis in 2017. New Delhi and Beijing have preferred to let the Ladakh crisis be handled bilaterally, one reason it rejected US President Donald Trump’s offer of mediation. Tokyo has only expressed condolences over the deaths of the Indian soldiers in Galwan Valley and pointedly said nothing about Chinese casualties. The Japanese navy has itself been upgraded and expanded in recent years because of the territorial disputes it has with an increasingly aggressive China. Despite its pacific Constitution, Tokyo has inducted a “helicopter destroyer” that has the some tonnage as India’s aircraft carriers and is now building a “helicopter carrier” which has a full flight deck. Japan has one of the best non-nuclear submarines in the world and cutting edge anti-submarine warfare technology. Masashi Nishihara, head of the Japanese defence think tank, Research Institute for Peace and Security, said, “We are leaders in submarine detection. Not only can we find them, we can identify any variety of submarine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-japan-hold-naval-exercises/story-cbmr1ET9HXReRdXCCUSjEP.html
28-06-2020||India||Locust swarms cloud parts of UP||New Delhi: Swarms of crop-eating locusts on Sunday moved further from Uttar Pradesh’s Bulandshahr to Kasganj, Oraiyya, Farrukhabad, and Hathras after the operation to control them a day earlier when they flew over parts of the National Capital Region (NCR) were ineffective, officials said. Residents banged utensils and played loud music to chase away the pests when they arrived in NCR after surviving a control operation in Rajasthan on June 26.K L Gurjar, the deputy director of Union agriculture ministry’s Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), said they could not control the entire swarms and they flew again early on Sunday morning. “We have arranged for drones, fire brigades, apart from seven teams with sprayer mounted on vehicles. We are trying our best. Control operations will begin again tonight [Sunday]. Teams are moving with the swarms,” said Gurjar.India has been battling invasions of desert locusts, which pose a severe risk to farm economy, since April. Locusts can fly hundreds of kilometres daily and a square-km swarm can eat as much crop as 35,000 people in a single day.The locusts have not so far impacted food security much but LWO has warned that the Kharif crops, especially maize and cotton, are likely to be impacted if the locust threats from the Indian Ocean and their breeding sites in India are not controlled.LWO teams in Rajasthan were trying to control fresh swarms coming in from Pakistan and Iran. “Control operations have been strengthened at the border to ensure swarms do not come in,” said Gurjar.Gurjar on Saturday said breeding of locusts has started in several pockets as the monsoon approaches Rajasthan’s arid regions. “The egg-laying has taken place and hoppers have emerged. But we will manage to control these hoppers immediately.”The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) on Saturday warned a general northerly movement of swarms will occur even as control operations continue. Some of the swarms in Kenya were expected to transit through South Sudan to reach the summer breeding areas of Sudan, where it has rained. If the rain is not enough, the swarms could continue to Chad and spread westwards across the Sahel in West Africa. The swarms in Somalia are likely to migrate across the Indian Ocean to the summer breeding areas along the India-Pakistan border.“In Southwest Asia, spring-bred swarms are present along both sides of the Indo-Pakistan border where they are awaiting the onset of the monsoon rains that will start in the coming days and allow the swarms to mature and lay eggs,” an FAO update said. It added locusts were mainly present in Rajasthan but some infestations continue to be reported from Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.“There are successive breeding cycles in the Horn of Africa. Some swarms from there are moving towards west Africa while some are moving towards Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Yemen. These can also come to India in July. Some are expected to directly move to India from the Horn of Africa with the monsoon winds,” Gurjar said.India Meteorological Department director-general M Mohapatra last week said winds were moving from the direction of the Horn of Africa towards India. “The wind direction is south-westerly during monsoon. I will not be able to comment on whether they will carry these swarms with them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/locust-swarms-cloud-parts-of-up/story-emRuBMvV0X6V3LxfGGPbyH.html

Thus, so far, a total of 3,09,712 patients have been cured of Covid-19. The recovery rate is 58.56% amongst Covid-19 patients. During the last 24 hours, a total of 13,832 Covid-19 patients have been cured. Presently, there are 2,03,051 active cases and all are under active medical supervision,” said the ministry in a statement.“India’s recovery rate has been steadily going up, which is good news. More than 50% of those having tested positive have recovered and taken out of active medical supervision,” said a senior health ministry official on condition of anonymity.Experts said rising recoveries may suggest that the outbreak was stabilizing.“When the number of those infected in a day is the same as number of people recovering then it usually highlights the fact that the disease outbreak is going to stabilize and start declining in some time, unless some other variables come in such as floating population or new births that change the entire dynamics,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, professor and head, community medicine department, Safdarjung Hospital.The government has focussed on aggressive testing, with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) adding more laboratories and introducing newer testing techniques. India’s current capacity is about 350,000 a day, with 200,000 samples tested daily on average.In the past 24 hours, 231,095 samples were tested in 1,036 diagnostic labs dedicated for Covid-19, including 749 government facilities and 287 private labs. The total number of samples tested stands at 8.2 million since the first sample was tested on January 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-58-patients-cured-of-covid-in-india-recovery-rate-improving-centre/story-4Vy6zup0bvDPIY0KY1QUDN.html

The examinations had commenced and had taken place till March 18, when it was put on hold due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Subsequently, the Board of Secondary Education of Rajasthan had decided in May that the remaining exams for class 10 will be held on June 29 and June 30.The petitioner approached the Rajasthan high court against that decision but the high court dismissed the same giving green signal for holding the remaining examinations, in strict compliance with the instructions of the central and state governments. Later, Devi had also filed a contempt petition before the high court, alleging that measures to contain Covid-19 have not been satisfactorily adopted by the authorities conducting the examinations. It was argued that there was no thermal screening of students, hand sanitisers were not available and measures have not been adopted to maintain social distancing during the exam. This petition was also dismissed by the high court on June 18, prompting Devi to approach the Supreme Court. She argued that the high court failed to take into account the fact the children will be exposed to the risk of contracting coronavirus. “The high court failed to appreciate that about 120 schools, which are examination centres, were used to quarantine labourers in transit,” the petition stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raj-class-10-boards-to-go-ahead-rules-sc/story-nYGYd2Yp5Lakgy1hta6a6N.html
28-06-2020||India||Timely lockdown helped us combat Covid-19, says Modi||Washington: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said India was able to combat Covid-19 far better than experts around the world believed it could because of the timely countrywide lockdown, which gave it time to ramp up health system significantly. The epidemic also taught India, he added, to be “self-reliant”.“With timely lockdown, India successfully protected the lives of tens of thousands of its citizens,” Modi said in his address to a virtual annual meeting of the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin. He added it was contrary to fears expressed by experts around the world that India could be in “deep crisis”.The lockdown was imposed from March 25 to check the spread of the disease before the government last month announced the phased plan to lift the stringent restrictions.Modi said Covid-19 fatalities were less than 12 for every million people in India. “Not even 12,” he repeated to emphasise the low number compared to more than 350 in the US and over 600 in the UK, Spain, and Italy. The US is the worst-hit by the Covid-19 in terms of the death toll and infections.“If India today has been able to fight the coronavirus, it is because the lockdown played a very big role in it.” Modi said India was able to increase the number of hospital beds, isolation wards, and labs to test coronavirus infections during the lockdown. He added three months ago, India was an importer of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), testing kits, and even N-95 masks. He added today India produces 4 million PPEs a week and 3 million N-95s. “We used to import earlier, and now we are moving towards exporting them,” he said.He added even ventilators, which are needed for severely ill and hospitalised patients, were mostly imported earlier, whereas 50,000 of them made in India are in the process of being deployed.“It is said that every crisis teaches us something or the other,” Modi said. He added Covid-19 has taught India to be self-reliant and this will help further strengthen the healthcare system.Modi spoke about his government’s approach to health, wellness and initiatives like eradication of TB and mitigation of Kala-azar (black fever.He said India has supplied medicines and medical equipment to over 150 countries and provided training to personnel of 16 countries. He added India sent anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine to deal with the pandemic to many countries, including the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/timely-lockdown-helped-us-combat-covid-19-says-modi/story-ggSt0nx9BpQeTYntb0q6OO.html
28-06-2020||India||Shah hits out at Rahul over comments against PM Modi||Union home minister Amit Shah has accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of making remarks “liked by” China and Pakistan amidst a Sino-Indian border dispute, and said his government is ready for a debate on the issue in Parliament.In an interview with news agency ANI, he said the government is capable of handling anti-India propaganda, but pointed out it is “painful” that the former president of the Congress party engaged in “ochi rajiniti (shallow-minded politics)” at a time of crisis.Shah particularly took exception to a June 21 tweet by Gandhi that claimed Prime Minister Narendra Modi ceded ground to the Chinese, and referred to him as “Surender Modi”. “#Surender Modi” trended on Twitter after Gandhi’s post.“It is a matter of self-introspection for him [Gandhi] and Congress that his hashtag is being taken forward by Pakistan and China...It is a matter of concern for Congress that the hashtag of their leader is being encouraged by Pakistan and China. You say what China and Pakistan like,” Shah told ANI.Shah said his government was not afraid of a debate. “There will be Parliament session. Come if you want to debate. Let all be discussed — from 1962 to today. No one is afraid of debates,” he said, referring to the 1962 war in which large tracts of land were occupied by the Chinese when a Congress-led government headed by the then Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was in charge.Shah also said it was not the appropriate time to comment on the situation at the Line of Actual Control, and “briefings were ongoing and that he would answer if need arose”.Shah’s interview came on a day Gandhi took to Twitter again and asked: “When will there be talk of the nation’s defence and security?”Gandhi and his Congress have been critical of the Centre’s handling of the border situation, calling for transparency on the part of the government, and alleging that China grabbed India’s land. The party has also hit out at Modi’s remarks at a June 19 all-party meeting that neither anyone was present in the Indian territory and nor any Indian post was captured by the Chinese. The Congress says China should not be allowed to use the Prime Minister’s words as a vindication of its position that it did not enter the Indian side.The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) later said there was a “mischievous interpretation” of Modi’s comments, and that the Prime Minister was clear that India will respond firmly to any attempts to transgress the Line of Actual Control.The allegations and counter-allegations erupted after the June 15 face-off between India and China along the contested border in eastern Ladakh. Twenty Indian Army soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops died in an ugly brawl in Galwan Valley, ratcheting up tensions between the neighbours amidst a military build-up on both sides. In his ANI interview, Shah said that under Modi’s leadership, India would win the war against the coronavirus disease and also deal with its border troubles with China successfully. “You are saying the country will win the two battles against corona and China under the leadership of Mr Modi. But please tell the reality to the nation. Isn’t it a fact that in three months only, India reached the fourth number in terms of coronavirus cases and these are continuously increasing? This government has no intention, no policy, no direction, no thought and no way to fight the coronavirus,” Congress’s chief spokesperson, Randeep Singh Surjewala, said.“Coming to China, the Prime Minister is saying no one has occupied Indian territory. Isn’t it a fact that Chinese army has occupied Galwan Valley where 20 Indian soldiers sacrificed their lives?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shah-hits-out-at-rahul-over-comments-against-pm-modi/story-6YZBXVD4hJcK2QtNUuLo4I.html

A similar resolution will be passed in the state assembly as well. I personally will take a delegation to the Prime Minister and submit the proposals,” Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said on Sunday.KCR was addressing a select gathering of invitees at P V Gyan Bhoomi; the samadhi of the former Prime Minister, at Necklace Road on the banks of Hussain Sagar in Hyderabad, inaugurating the latter’s birth centenary celebrations.Describing Narasimha Rao as a multifaceted personality, the chief minister said the fruits of economic reforms introduced by the former Prime Minister were being enjoyed by present generations.“It requires a lot of conviction, commitment and knowledge to undertake reforms. Narasimha Rao had displayed these qualities in undertaking reforms in every field that he had been entrusted with. His reforms with regard to land rights, education and economic policies had shaped the country’s future,” he said.KCR called upon the PV centenary celebration committee headed by Rajya Sabha member K Kesava Rao to highlight the “360 degree personality” of the former PM during the year-long worldwide celebrations.“We will keep the committee open ended so that many more people who have knowledge about Narasimha Rao can join and contribute.

28-06-2020||India||BJP government protecting Ramdev, targeting us: Uttarakhand Congress||The Uttarakhand state Congress on Sunday accused the BJP-led Central and state governments of going soft on Patanjali’s Swami Ramdev for allegedly claiming falsely to have found the ayurvedic cure for Covid-19, while it was busy filing cases against Congress leaders and workers for staging a political protest without permission. Congress vice-president Suryakant Dhasmana alleged that Swami Ramdev and Balkrishna had violated the norms and regulations of the National Disaster Management Act (NDMA), 2005 and Drugs and Cosmetics Act by making unverified claims of finding a cure for Covid-19 disease. Two cases have been filed against Ramdev, Balkrishna and other members of Patanjali Ayurveda in separate incidents in Rajasthan and Bihar over their Coronil claim. FIR in Rajasthan against Ramdev, aides over ‘Coronil“It clearly signals that both the Centre and the state government are hand in glove with Patanjali due to which they are not taking any major action against Swami Ramdev and Balkrishna, who had openly claimed to have found a cure for Covid-19 with Coronil,” said Dhasmana. He said the duo violated the circular issued on April 1 by Centre’s AYUSH department prohibiting advertising of any medicine as cure for Covid-19, citing the NDMA.“The circular had clearly prohibited anyone from advertising a medicine or cure for Covid-19 and termed such an act as a crime under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act with appropriate punishment. However, both Ramdev and Balkrishna, in complete violation of the circular and the guidelines of Covid-19, held a press conference in Haridwar and announced the launch of their medicine Coronil, while making a false claim that it can cure Covid-19. Despite this brazen act of theirs, they have not been booked either by the Centre or the state government under the NDMA,” said Dhasmana. The Congress leader lashed out at the state government for booking Congress leaders instead. “On one hand, it is taking no action against Patanjali for making false claims and on the other hand, it is busy booking Congress leaders in false cases for raising relevant issues of public. If the government is not colluding with Patanjali, then it should legally issue a denial of Coronil and take proper action against them,” he said. Also Read: Uttarakhand liquor traders want to surrender their shops amid huge lossesUttarakhand police on Thursday (June 25) had booked Congress state president Pritam Singh, senior vice president Suryakant Dhasmana and 163 other party workers for staging a protest in Dehradun without permission and adherence to social distancing norms.Responding to Congress, Patanjali Ayurveda’s CEO Balkrishna said that Patanjali registered Coronil as a drug after the clinical control trials in Jaipur’s National Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS).“The clinical trials of a medicine made from Ashwagandha, Giloi, Tulsi and other Ayurveda components were held successfully on patients in NIMS. The results of the trials were put in public on June 23. Later for better compliance by the patients, we got our drug Coronil registered as per the norms and regulations. Before that Patanjali never called it a medicine for Corona’s cure, both clinically and legally.”He added that there was “absolutely no scope of any dispute” over the clinical control trials conducted under the clinical trial registry of India (CTRI) provisions.State BJP rubbished Congress allegations.“It seems Congress has lost its mental balance because it is under attack on various issues including their leadership’s relation with China and misuse of PM Relief Fund during their rule. It has no idea how to react to these attacks, hence these baseless allegations,” Devendra Bhasin, BJP state vice-president said.He said that Congress’ charge of “collusion” of BJP governments with Ramdev was bereft of logic.“If our government both at the Centre and the state was in collusion with Swami Ramdev, then why would they stop him from advertising Coronil with immediate effect? I think the Congress leaders should rather take Ayurvedic medicine to improve their intelligence,” said Bhasin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-government-protecting-ramdev-targeting-us-uttarakhand-congress/story-Ubg5asuukdR4yhKvJ7TXYJ.html

On Sunday, the state recorded 1,267 new coronavirus cases with Bangalore (urban and rural) accounting for a whopping 910 of those new cases. The state till date has recorded 13,190 Covid-19 cases which include 207 deaths and 7,507 people being discharged after being cured.Revenue minister R Ashoka on Sunday announced a new tagging system whereby anybody under quarantine will have to compulsorily wear it for two weeks. If anybody tries to remove the tag, it will send such data to a central monitoring system. “We are working on this and it would be implemented shortly to ensure that nobody in quarantine jumps it by leaving their cell phone at home.”This is said to be similar in technology to ones used in ankle monitors in the USA though the minister refused to provide further information on this.ALSO READ | Karnataka student who appeared for board exams with 19 others tests Covid-19 positiveOn the record spike in the state, a worried health department official who did not want to be named – as he is not authorised to speak to the media – said that while increased testing seems to be one of the reasons for the spike, on the other hand in the state capital Bangalore at least ‘it looks like it has reached community transmission stage’.The state government has taken a number of measures over the last couple of days including sealing four major parts of the city, closing some busy market hubs, ordering full curfew from dawn to dusk on Sundays and various other measures.Meanwhile, leader of opposition in the assembly and former CM Siddaramiah demanded a white paper from the state government on Covid-19 management. Alleging that there were irregularities to the tune of Rs 3,300 crores in the procurement of medical equipment required to combat and contain the pandemic he urged the government to release full details of all purchases made and money received from the Centre.Claiming that there has been irregularities in purchase of PPE kits, masks, oxygen cylinders and ventilators, Siddaramiah claimed that these purchases have been made at double the market price “The finance department has objected to the same and the CM should clarify on the issue,” he claimed in a release.He also said that the number of tests done has reduced in the state from 16,000 per day to 11,000 per day over the last 15 days. Stating that while 9,200 ventilators were required on an emergency basis he claimed that only 1,500 are available. “The state had asked for 33,000 ventilators from the Centre but only 90 have been provided.” State government officials were not available for comment on Sunday to respond to Siddaramiah’s charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-logs-1-267-new-covid-19-cases-record-surge-for-second-successive-day/story-sWosCW5RRxsR6KwuMXLyiI.html
28-06-2020||India||DGCA issues show cause notice to AirAsia India executive after pilot alleges safety violations||The aviation regulator DGCA has issued a show cause notice to a top executive of AirAsia India two weeks after one of its pilots, who runs a popular YouTube channel called Flying Beast, alleged violations of safety norms by the low-cost airline, senior officials said on Sunday. “A show cause notice has been issued to Manish Uppal, Head of Operations, AirAsia India after the pilot’s allegations,” the DGCA officials said. An AirAsia India spokesperson said, “AirAsia India confirms receipt of the notice and we are assisting the regulator in its fact finding process. We will fully cooperate with the regulator.” Captain Gaurav Taneja, a popular Youtuber, tweeted on June 14 that he has been suspended by AirAsia India “for standing up for safe operations of an aircraft and its passengers”. On June 15, he posted a detailed video on YouTube titled “Reasons behind suspension from my pilot job”. Taneja alleged in the video that the airline has asked its pilots to do 98 per cent of landings in “Flap 3” mode, which allows it to save fuel. He said if a pilot does not do 98 per cent of landings in “Flap 3” mode, the airline considers it a violation of its standard operating procedure (SOP). Flaps are part of wings of an aircraft and they are engaged to create a drag during a landing or a take-off. Taneja gave the example of the Imphal airport, where the plane descends more steeply as compared to other airports when approaching for landing. He said when an aircraft is coming down steeply, it needs to have a drag so that it remains slow, and in these circumstances a pilot has to do a “Flap full” landing. “In order to achieve targets, what would people do? They will do Flap 3 landings without giving consideration whether it is safe or unsafe. This directly impacts the passenger safety,” he said in his YouTube video.  If something happens during a Flap 3 landing, then the question would be asked to the pilot if he or she cares more about saving fuel or 180 passengers’ lives, Taneja said. On June 15, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said on Twitter that it had taken note of the concerns raised by some stakeholders “against a particular airline and its approach to safety”. “DGCA has already started an investigation into the issues flagged and shall take appropriate action based on the outcome of the said investigation,” it added.

The China National Biotec Group (CNBG) said on Sunday that early human test results for a coronavirus vaccine candidate suggested it could be safe and effective, the second vaccine candidate from the firm to show encouraging results in a clinical trial.Chinese researchers have been allowed to test eight vaccine candidates in humans at home and abroad, making the Asian giant a major front-runner in the race to develop a vaccine against the virus that has killed nearly 500,000 people globally. The experimental shot, developed by a Beijing-based unit of CNBG, has induced high-level antibodies in all the inoculated participants in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial involving 1,120 healthy people, according to preliminary data of the trial. Earlier this month, CNBG, said that another vaccine candidate produced by its Wuhan-based unit also triggered high-level antibodies safely in clinical trial participants.Currently, there are more than 13 experimental vaccines in clinical trials among the 140 being developed to fight Covid-19.ALSO READ | Delhi, Maharashtra among 5 states likely to get first lot of Covid-19 drugGlobal health watchdog, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has identified the candidates developed by Oxford University-AstraZeneca and Moderna Inc as the front-runners in the race to find an effective vaccine for the viral infection. AstraZeneca’s experimental Covid-19 vaccine is probably the world’s leading candidate and most advanced in terms of development, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) chief scientist said on Friday.The British drugmaker has already begun large-scale, mid-stage human trials of the vaccine, which was developed by researchers at the University of Oxford.News agency Reuters quoted WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan as saying,“Certainly in terms of how advanced they are, the stage at which they are, they are I think probably the leading candidate.” British pharma major AstraZeneca, which has already begun Phase III human trials of its AZD1222 (formerly known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine candidate, signed its tenth supply-and-manufacturing deal earlier this week. Brazil announced on Saturday it had signed a $127 million agreement to start producing locally the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The country is slated to initially produce 30 million doses of the vaccine — half by December and half by January of next year, according to a Reuters report.ALSO READ | Over 80k new cases since Monday in India; AstraZeneca, Moderna emerge as top vaccine contenders: Covid-19 week wrapEarlier this month, the AstraZeneca CEO told a radio station that the vaccine candidate would likely provide protection against Covid-19 for one year.US firm Moderna Inc, which has already started Phase II trials for its vaccine candidate mRNA-1273, has partnered with drugmaker Catalent Inc to produce 100 million doses starting in the third quarter of 2020. Under the deal, Catalent will also provide packaging and labeling, storage and distribution services to support Moderna’s late-stage clinical trial for the vaccine. Catalent is already in partnership with Johnson and Johnson as well as AstraZeneca.Closer home homegrown pharma major Hetero has started delivering the generic version of antiviral drug Remdesivir to states across the country for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Sold under the brand name Covifor, the drug has been priced at Rs 5,400 per vial and will be available at hospitals to treat the coronavirus infection.Delhi and Maharashtra -- the two worst-hit states in the country by the coronavirus pandemic will be the first to receive the first batch of the antiviral medicine. The Hyderabad-based drugmaker has dispatched 20,000 vials of Covifor to five states. Besides Maharashtra and the national capital, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu are the other two states that will receive the first batch of the drug. Telangana, which has seen a sudden surge in coronavirus cases in the last one week, is the fifth state that will receive the first batch of the medicine.India on Saturday allowed the use of dexamethasone as an alternative to methylprednisolone to treat coronavirus patients with moderate and severe symptoms. The World Health Organization had called for a rapid increase in production of dexamethasone, after British clinical trials found it had life-saving potential for critically-ill coronavirus patients.The Union Health Ministry put out a revised version of the Clinical Management Protocol: COVID-19 - a document published for use by health professionals as a reference. Earlier this month, the ministry had added the loss of smell and taste as new symptoms of the infectious disease in the manual.The use of dexamethasone, which is used to reduce inflammation in other diseases such as arthritis, has been cleared for patients in critical need of oxygen support and those who have excessive inflammatory response, the document states.India has recorded successive highest single-day spikes of 18,552 fresh cases on an average, pushing the total number of cases well over the 5 lakh-mark, the latest data from the Health Ministry shows. India now has the fourth-highest number of coronavirus cases among 10 nations worst-hit by the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/british-pharma-major-astrazeneca-ahead-in-global-race-for-covid-19-vaccine-all-you-need-to-know/story-wAc0QNcBaul7VyDUzOie8J.html
28-06-2020||India||UN 75th anniversary draft declaration phrase changed after India, 5 others object||UN General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande has changed a phrase in the draft declaration to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations after India along with countries including the UK and the US raised objection to the sentence, understood to be similar to wording used by the Chinese Communist Party.Muhammad-Bande circulated the draft declaration to UN Member States under silence procedure, under which if no Member State raises any objections to the draft within a specified time period, the text is adopted.According to United Nations Association–UK (UNA-UK), a charitable company focusing on UK action at the UN, Britain’s acting ambassador Jonathan Allen broke the silence procedure on June 24 “on behalf of the members of the ‘five eyes’ intelligence community - the UK, US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and India.It said that the six countries objected to one phrase towards the end of the declaration that read - “to realise our shared vision for a common future”.The countries wanted this wording to be replaced with “to realise our shared vision for a better future as envisaged in the preamble of the UN Charter.” With the suggested wording, the paragraph in the draft declaration would have read, “What we agree today will affect the sustainability of our planet as well the welfare of generations for decades to come. Through reinvigorated global action and by building on the progress achieved in the last 75 years, we are determined to ensure the future we want. To achieve this, we will mobilise resources, strengthen our efforts and show unprecedented political will and leadership. We will work together with partners to strengthen coordination and global governance for the common good of present and future generations and to realise our shared vision for a better future as envisaged in the preamble of the UN Charter.”  The UNA-UK said in a statement that it has heard from a number of sources that the reason the six countries objected to the phrase “to realise our shared vision for a common future” is because ‘shared vision for a common future’ has some “similarity to wording used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to describe its foreign policy aspirations.” It said the phrase was used in a report by former Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Hu Jintao to the 18th CCP congress in 2012. “Thus, the language needs to be viewed in the context of the current great power rivalry between the USA and China, with the UK firmly allying with the US,” it said.Following the objection, Muhammad-Bande wrote to UN Member States on June 25 proposing a re-worked phrase to substitute the sentence on which silence was broken.“We will work together with partners to strengthen coordination and global governance for the common future of present and coming generations,” the new phrase proposed by the UNGA President read.On the evening of June 26, Muhammad-Bande said that there was no objection to the proposed new phrase.However, he said he was “notified of an issue regarding a particular element of the final draft declaration, which would require further clarification in order to conclude the process.” The declaration by the “Heads of State and Government representing the peoples of the world” to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the UN is to be adopted on September 21, 2020 and takes note of the COVID19 pandemic that “continues to reverberate around our world.” “The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us in the most powerful way that we are closely interconnected and only as strong as our weakest link. Only by working together and in solidarity can we end the pandemic and effectively tackle its consequences.  “Only together can we build resilience against future pandemics and other global challenges. Multilateralism is not an option but a necessity as we build back better for a more equal, more resilient, and more sustainable world. The United Nations must be at the centre of our efforts,” the declaration says.The declaration also underscores that armed conflicts and threats against international peace and security must be urgently resolved through peaceful means. “The United Nations must better address all forms and domains of threats. Terrorism and violent extremism conducive to terrorism are serious threats to international peace and security,” it says.The declaration also emphasises on the need to “upgrade” the UN, saying that “we commit to instil new life in the discussions on the reform of the Security Council and continue the work to revitalise the General Assembly and strengthen the Economic and Social Council. The review of the peacebuilding architecture has our full support.”  It is noteworthy that reform of the multilateral system and fight against terrorism are among the key priorities for India as it prepares to sit in the Security Council for a two-year term beginning January 1, 2021 as a non-permanent member after overwhelmingly winning the UNSC election this month.Termed as NORMS, India’s focus will be on ‘New Orientation For A Reformed Multilateral System.’ India’s priorities include new opportunities for progress, effective response to international terrorism, reforming multilateral systems, comprehensive approach to peace and security and technology with a human touch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/un-75th-anniversary-draft-declaration-phrase-changed-after-india-5-others-object/story-MKsZcU1cB3qPc0uBNvDOQP.html

The examinations had commenced in March and were held up till March 18 when it was put on hold due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Subsequently, the Board of Secondary Education of Rajasthan had decided in May that the remaining exams for class 10 will be held on June 29 and June 30.The petitioner approached the Rajasthan high court against that decision but the high court dismissed the same giving a green signal for holding the remaining examinations in strict compliance with the instructions of the central and state government. Later, Devi had also filed a contempt petition before the high court alleging that measures to contain Covid-19 have not been satisfactorily adopted by the authorities conducting the examinations. It was argued that there was no thermal screening of students, hand sanitisers were not available and measures have not been adopted to maintain social distancing during the exam. This petition was also dismissed by the high court on June 18 prompting Devi to approach the Supreme Court. She argued that the high court failed to take into account the fact the children will be exposed to the risk of getting infected by Coronavirus jeopardizing their health.“The high court failed to appreciate that about 120 schools which are examination centres were used to quarantine people for labourers in transit”, the petition stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-junks-plea-to-cancel-remaining-class-10-exams-of-rajasthan-state-board/story-rCakjaihoLd22dhcqphcHO.html

In state capital Thiruvananthapuram and Malappuram in north Kerala, many such cases have come to light. Medical workers say in such cases it is difficult to trace their primary contacts and source of origin.The state has also decided to increase the number of tests after people returning to the state have gone up considerably. On an average, 40 flights are arriving in the four international airports in the state, all from the Gulf countries.There was criticism that the state is keeping its tests very low to keep its records but the government has denied it. The CM said from next month, at least 15,000 samples will be tested every day. Now the daily average tests are between 5,000 and 5,500 but many experts said it has to increase its testing rate immediately.“We have started anti-body tests at all airports for returning expatriates. This will help in containing imported cases. We will increase tests by next month,” said state health minister K K Shailaja.After NRIs and people stranded in other states returned and the government relaxed lockdown norms the state witnessed a steady increase in coronavirus cases but contrary to initial efforts it failed to ramp up its testing, experts said. As on Sunday 2,16,780 people were tested but they are very low when compared to other states..Meanwhile, the total number of cases went up to 4,189 with the 118 new patients on Sunday. Out of this, 2,150 have recovered and active cases are now 2,015. At least 1,75, 734 people are under observation.

She is happy for herself as well as all the other actors who are able to find work in this tough phase. Pavleen shot for an advertisement at her home recently and also got offers for new projects that will happen in coming months, “Actors are attentively exploring new avenues. Earlier, brands were largely tapping bloggers and influencers for their digital promotions. But now, actors are able to find time for the same which they earlier preferred to give a miss. So it’s a win win for both the brand as well as the artiste. Though the payments made are not that big an amount but then we too need to keep on working and get going.”Besides, money it is also about reinventing ones craft. “Every day we get to see so many cooking and workout videos being posted by actor and other celebs. It’s not only about money always, as actors we also need to keep ourselves active and busy. It’s about keep working on your craft and propagating your talent,”She feels such projects where you get to connect with audience is great for mental health too particularly during this phase. “I started a #railchallenge which was about reading something from a book and posting online. It was such a fun task. The situation is bad for everyone. We are still better off than many other professionals who are struggling in every aspect of life.”Pavleen is not a part of second season of ‘City of Dreams-2’ but will be shooting for ‘Made in Heaven-2’ and ‘Marzi-2’. Talking more about her projects she said, “MiH-2 as well as the other series were supposed to be shot abroad. Besides, I am getting queries for a late-July shoot for a web series and another in October. Also, I am happy that my film ‘Bhor’, which was screened at many festivals, will release on OTT soon.”The Delhite has shot for travel show ‘Bazaar’ in Lucknow. “I shot extensively at Hazratganj, Aminabad and Chowk. I remember going to Ram Advani bookstore, savouring basket chaat and indulging into chikankari shopping. I visited the place again to shop for my brother’s wedding. I love the language of the city which is so beautiful. During the travel show I got to explore another side of Lucknow.”She now hopes to go back to work soon. “It’s great to be with family but we actors are workaholic and it is high time to go back to our normal work. We are longing to go back to the sets but don’t know when things will get normal and the shoot will resume on the sets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/actors-are-exploring-new-avenues-says-pavleen-gujral/story-2x7cQoPSfmnrVBeg6WXc6J.html

In a Facebook post, he appealed to the people to stay calm and have a firm belief that “no storm can continue forever.” Naidu noted that most of the countries have ended the lockdowns and have started focusing on economy. He said the government is taking continuous measures to boost the economy and asked everyone to support it by taking necessary precautions and following the guidelines. Calling upon the people to collectively fight against this unprecedented health crisis, the vice president said India’s strength lies in its faith in spirituality and trust in science. He advised people not to press the “panic button” but reach out for the “prevention and protection buttons”. Maintaining that the solution to Covid-19 lies in precautions, the vice president listed simple steps such as the use of face masks, practising safe distancing and washing of hands frequently as the only known ways of staying safe. Along with these steps, he also suggested the use of traditional foods, herbal and medicinal plant preparations that have proved to be great immunity boosters.

About 70 labourers from Naugava village in Naraini tehsil have decided to do it for free – a “shramdaan” to give life again to land turning barren. Authorities now want to pay them for the job they have taken upon themselves, but the villagers have turned down the offer. They all say they could not find work under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. Shyamlal, one of the workers, says a stretch of the 40-km-long canal between Guhala Kalan and Divli villages was not cleaned for years. “Due to this, the fertile agriculture land was becoming barren. I was sitting idle since I did not get any job under the MGNREGA. Then I thought that I should clean the canal so that water reaches its tail-end and we are able to grow foodgrains to feed our children,” he says. Another labourer, Ramswaroop, says people from nearby villages have donated food to them, which is being cooked by women involved in the “sharmdaan”. Gulabrani, Mamta, Sumitra and Rani are among the women taking care of the task. They have named their kitchen “Shramdaan Rasoi”. At present, 65-70 people are involved in the initiative, says Gulabrani. “Till a few years ago, crops were irrigated by water from this canal. But for the past two to four years due to the non-cleaning of silt, there was a shortage of water,” she says. Sumitra, who is also cooking food with Gulabrani, says if every agriculture field gets water, crops can be produced and people will not have to “go to other places to earn a living”. Meanwhile, the Executive Engineer of the Irrigation Department in Banda, Sharad Singh, said, “As we got news on Saturday of labourers doing the ‘shramdaan’, a departmental staffer was sent.” “We spoke to them over the phone. Their work is praiseworthy. We offered to pay wages but they did not agree to it,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-work-for-them-under-mgnrega-up-villagers-take-up-canal-cleaning-project-on-their-own/story-SyCOd5qS38jfYI4UlHxF2M.html
28-06-2020||India||Uttarakhand liquor traders want to surrender their shops amid huge losses||Amid losses due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many liquor traders in Uttarakhand have applied to the government for surrendering their licenses to run wine shops. In their applications, the traders have cited low sales and huge losses along with the ‘pressure’ of paying the Minimum Monthly Guaranteed Duty (MMGD) every month.There are about 650 wine shops in the state and the sale of alcohol is one of the major sources of revenue for the government which rakes in over Rs 3,000 crore annually.The government gives licenses on a yearly basis every year to liquor traders.Baburam Jaiswal, a prominent liquor trader in Nainital said, “The condition of liquor traders in the state is bad since the pandemic started. First, we had zero sales during the lockdown period from March 22 to May 3 and now in Unlock 1.0, the demand is lower than usual. It has hugely affected our earnings.”Jaiswal claimed that at least 90 liquor traders have applied for surrendering their shops, added, “On top of the losses, we have the pressure of MMGD which is a monthly fixed duty that we have to pay to the state excise department irrespective of the sales we make. It ranges from Rs 40 lakh to Rs 1 crore depending on the sales and the location of the shop. These are the reasons that many of us have applied for surrendering the shops but are yet to get any reply from the authorities concerned.”Citing other reasons he claimed that earlier the earning share in the liquor sales for the traders was “20 pe rcent which has now been reduced by the government to 14.5% after the Corona tax was implemented on liquor.”Another liquor trader who wished to be identified only by his last name Bansal, said, “At present, there are several issues being faced by the liquor traders in the state including a shortage of labour in shops and low sales.”“First we suffered in the lockdown and now when the shops have opened the sales are very low because there are no tourists and almost no weddings in the state. Despite this, we have to pay the monthly revenue to the government,” said Bansal.He wanted the government to provide liquor traders some respite.“The government should only take tax on the sales we make and not the MMGD or else we won’t be able to survive,” Bansal said.The state government in an effort to give some relief to the liquor traders, had earlier decided to waive off the tax on the unsold liquor during the lockdown period in which the shops were closed. The waived off tax is about Rs 230 crore.However, a few days ago a petition was filed in the Uttarakhand High Court against the government move alleging that the ‘government favoured the liquor traders by waiving off the tax.’ The HC while hearing the petition, issued notice to the government demanding reply on the same in three weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-liquor-traders-want-to-surrender-their-shops-amid-huge-losses/story-GejcWTEYd3cJBXx3IAj7xL.html

28-06-2020||India||New normal in AC trains, breathe in operation theratre-like fresh air||The Railways’ air conditioned trains will now have operation theatre-like fresh air pumped into its coaches, replacing the circulated air which raises the chances of spread of infections, officials have said.The experiment, started with 15 pairs of air conditioned trains being run by the Railways on the Rajdhani routes since May 12, will be replicated in all AC trains as part of the national transporter’s preparations for post-Covid operations.“The Roof Mounted AC Package Unit (RMPU) system of Indian Railways AC coaches replaces air more than 16-18 times per hour just like in OTs,” officials said.Previously, these AC trains had air change six to eight times per hour and 80 per cent of the air that was pushed into coaches was recirculated air, while 20 per cent was fresh air.However, with the increase in the number of air changes, there has been a 10 to 15 per cent increase in energy consumption. “This is the price one has to pay for the safety of passengers. This is the new normal. The way an AC works is that it uses recirculated air so that it gets cooler faster. When we use fresh air it takes more time to cool, so there’s additional energy consumption,” an officer said.The Railways has also increased the centralised AC’s temperature from the usual 23 degrees to 25 degrees as passengers are no longer being provided linen.Officials said that on the advise of the health experts, the Railways’ has modified its non-AC coaches as isolation coaches for treating mild coronavirus cases and said that they have also applied health ministry guidelines to modify the ac units on board the special Rajdhani trains to ensure that the disease does not spread.As per the Ministry of Health guidelines, centralised AC is acceptable provided complete air change inside an AC coach takes place at least 12 times per hour, officials said.So far, only a study by Chinese researchers has concluded that droplet transmission was prompted by air-conditioned ventilation. Not many other studies, however, have associated AC use with coronavirus spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-normal-in-ac-trains-breathe-in-operation-theratre-like-fresh-air/story-Z1YWy7qCddvdscdzkpdWMN.html

First, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi poked PM Narendra Modi raising the issue of “national security” after his monthly ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio address, then Union home minister Amit Shah accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of shallow politics aligned with Pakistan and China’s interests. It has now been followed with a verbal attack by Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who has alleged that the PM CARES fund received money from a Chinese firm associated with their military. He has also alleged that several BJP presidents over the years have toured China and interacted with their ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP).“No president of any political party in this country has had to continuous exchanges with CCP like BJP Presidents right from Rajnath Singh to Gadkari ji to Amit Shah. There have been visits and delegations between BJP and CCP, repeatedly,” Singhvi said on Sunday.Also Read: ‘You say what China and Pakistan like’: Amit Shah’s scathing attack on Rahul GandhiOn Saturday BJP had accused the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, chaired by Congress President Sonia Gandhi of having received funds from the Chinese Embassy between 2005 and 2009 during the Congress-led UPA government’s tenure apart from other allegedly dodgy contributions and transactions into the fund. The Congress had issued an explanation later in the day and claimed that the BJP was dragging Rajiv Gandhi Foundation to distract attention from the government’s handling of the current border crisis with China that saw 20 Indian Army soldiers killed in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Singhvi built on the theme by alleging that despite some pointed questions by the party on the Chinese incursions since May 2020, the government was sidestepping them.“In last few days we’ve given you maps, points, locations, satellite images, photos but answer has only been- Rajiv Gandhi foundation. I am deliberately making a statement which I need not & I dare PM, govt & ruling party to falsify my next statement,” Singhvi was quoted as saying on Congress party’s official website. He went to raise questions over the alleged donations to the PM CARES Fund, established recently by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to mobilize relief money to deal with crises such as the coronavirus pandemic.“Rs 7 crore in this fund has been received from Huawei. Everyone knows Huawei is the alter ego of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) hence the Chinese government. 30 crores has come from Chinese company tiktok. Paytm with 38% Chinese controlled shareholding has donated,” Singhvi was quoted as saying on the official website of the Congress party.Earlier today, in an interview to news agency ANI, Amit Shah said that the NDA government was ready for discussion on the Indo-China border conflict in the Parliament.“There will be Parliament (session). If you want to discuss, we will. Let everything be discussed from 1962 to today. No one is afraid of discussion. But when the soldiers of the country are making efforts, the government is taking solid steps after taking a stand, at that time, making statements that please Pakistan and China should not be done,” said Shah.Also Read: When will there be talk of nation’s security? Rahul Gandhi asks PM ModiHe also hit out at Rahul Gandhi for alleging that PM Modi had ‘surrendered” Indian territory to China by denying Chinese incursions and occupation of Indian territory in the last two months. “It is a matter of self-introspection for him (Rahul Gandhi) and Congress that his hashtag is being taken forward by Pakistan and China. It is not for me. It is a matter of concern for Congress that the hashtag of their leader is being encouraged by Pakistan and China. You say what China and Pakistan like. And at this time of crisis,” said Shah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-cares-fund-received-money-from-chinese-companies-am-singhvi/story-4Dd0P4f9LVdASslXkdeyfP.html

28-06-2020||India||26/11 plotter Sajjid Mir lives under ‘highest level of ISI protection’ in Pakistan||In its annual Country Reports on Terrorism, the United States has accused Islamabad of not prosecuting 2019 Pulwama attack Jaish-e-Mohammed mastermind Masood Azhar and 26/11 Mumbai attack master planner Sajjid Mir aka Majid despite their “widely believed” presence in Pakistan.While the Imran Khan government continues to deny the presence of these killers in Pakistan, Mir and Azhar live under highest level of ISI protection that country. Sajjid Mir, the handler of American national David Coleman Headley, lives in Garden Villa Housing Society, Adiala Jail Road, Rawalpindi, Pakistan or 27, C-Block, Al Faisal Town, Lahore or Ganda Nala area of Lahore in Pakistan.Carrying a reward of US $5 million on his head, 44-year-old Mir was the man who directed the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists to take the head shot at Holtzberg couple at Chabad House in Mumbai during the 26/11 massacre. Responsible for security of LeT’s operations chief Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi till 2010, Mir was not only responsible for recruiting terrorists abroad and training in terror camps in Pakistan but also was part of the ISI’s Indian Mujahideen operation or what was identified as the Karachi project.While the Indian intelligence has kept track of Mir, the terrorist has level seven protection, which is normally given to heads of state by the ISI in Pakistan. He underwent plastic surgery after the 26/11 attacks.Similarly, the architect of the 2016 Pathankot air base and 2019 Pulwama attack, Masood Azhar, lies bed-ridden at JeM headquarters at Markaz-e-Usaman-o-Ali, Railway Link Road, in Bhawalpur in Pakistan’s Punjab province. While Azhar plans the attack against India, the strike is executed by his brother Maulana Rauf Asghar and his team. The veteran terrorist is also known to stay in Madarassa Bilal Habshi, Kotka Imam Shah, Gareha Shah Jahan, P S Mandan, Bannu, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) or Madrassa Masjid-e-Luqman, Lakkitajazai Road, Lakkimarwat, KPK.While Sajjid Mir was declared a global terrorist in 2012, Masood Azhar was declared a global terrorist on May 1, 2019, after much delay with China blocking his designation by the UNSC 1267 committee four times. Azhar continues to remain active as a terror leader of Pakistan but Sajjid Mir has gone below the radar at the instructions of ISI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/26-11-plotter-sajjid-mir-lives-under-highest-level-of-isi-protection-in-pakistan/story-YD37EtMDzTOGkddqufHHmJ.html

Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on June 20 said that the government will start thinking on resuming scheduled international passenger flights in mid-July, when it expects the domestic air traffic to reach 50-55 per cent of the levels before coronavirus. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said last Friday it is extending the suspension of scheduled international passenger flights in the country till July 15 but added that some international scheduled services on selected routes may be permitted on a case-to-case basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-to-operate-170-flights-under-phase-4-of-vande-bharat-mission/story-87CvsvY6JEDdOMbl8mN6oK.html

Let everything be discussed from 1962 to today. No one is afraid of discussion. But when the soldiers of the country are making efforts, the government is taking solid steps after taking a stand, at that time, making statements that please Pakistan and China should not be done,” said Shah.He also took on Congress for not appointing anyone apart from the members of Gandhi family its president. “After Advaniji, Rajnathji, Nitinji, Rajnathji again, I became (party president) and now Naddaji. Is there a member of the same family? After Indiraji, tell me a Congress President who is outside the Gandhi family. What democracy they talk about?” said Shah.Gandhi and the Congress party have been attacking the government since the June 15 skirmish. On Friday, Gandhi posted a video and said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should tell “the truth” as several accounts were saying that China has made incursions in Eastern Ladakh.His mother and Congress president Sonia Gandhi accused the PM Modi-led central government of “mismanagement” which led to a full-blown crisis on the borders with China.“True to its character, the government is in denial. The intrusion was detected and reported on May 5. Instead of a resolution, the situation deteriorated rapidly and there were violent clashes on June 15-16. Twenty Indian soldiers were martyred, 85 injured and 10 went ‘missing’ until they were returned,” she said at a virtual meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision-making body.Today again, the Congress party accused the government on Twitter of “giving in” to intruders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/you-say-what-china-and-pakistan-like-amit-shah-s-scathing-attack-on-rahul-gandhi/story-me1Tb7a7a5j3c17S8xOgVL.html

28-06-2020||India||‘We long for those great leaders’: Congress’ latest attack on govt over Ladakh face-off||The Congress party kept the heat on the government by once again accusing it of “giving in to intruders” in reference to the face-off between the Indian and Chinese soldiers in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley.“India once had leaders with great courage & fortitude. Leaders that never backed down from threat or adversary. Today, as our govt gives in to intruders, we long for those great leaders & the India they made,” the Congress said on Twitter on Sunday. India once had leaders with great courage & fortitude. Leaders that never backed down from threat or adversary. Today, as our govt gives in to intruders, we long for those great leaders & the India they made. pic.twitter.com/fVlCyPluBaThe party attached a video with the tweet which talks about India giving a befitting reply to the Chinese in the 60s which shaped the Indo-China relations in the years to come.The Opposition party has been attacking the government since the June 15 clashes. It has accused the government of giving away Indian territory to China after the incident, a charge launched by the Congress after the all-party meeting on June 19 where Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that not an inch of India’s territory has been taken by the Chinese forces.The attack has been led by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, his son and former party president Rahul Gandhi and former prime minister Manmohan Singh.Two day ago, Sonia Gandhi, son Rahul and daughter Priyanka released three video messages back-to-back in which they stepped up attacks on PM Modi over the India-China border standoff and asked the government to take people into confidence on the extent of territories being occupied by Chinese troops.Sonia Gandhi recalled PM Modi’s statements that China hasn’t crossed into our territory. But, she said, Chinese forces do appear to have occupied Indian territory according to defence experts, satellite images and statements emerging out of the foreign ministry.The Gandhi family’s relentless attack on the government has been countered by the top leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with allegation that Congress’ Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF) was beneficiaries of donations from the Chinese government and its embassy in New Delhi.Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad alleged that the donation had led the Congress to support China. He also said RGF had pushed for a free trade agreement between the two countries, leading to a huge trade deficit skewed in favour of China, and that the donation led to the Congress supporting China.BJP chief JP Nadda even put out excerpts from annual reports of Rajiv Gandhi Foundation to allege that the PM Relief Fund, which receives donations from the public, had gone ahead to donate money to the RGF, when the Manmohan Singh-led coalition was in power.The Congress insists that PM Modi’s concluding statement at the all-party meeting that Chinese troops were not present in Indian territory contradicted the earlier statements made by the Army chief, the defence Minister and the foreign ministry. The party asked if no Chinese troops had crossed the Line of Actual Control (LAC), what was the reason for the face-off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-long-for-those-great-leaders-congress-latest-attack-on-govt-over-ladakh-face-off/story-wtQIuGX0eC1DofgbIGlBMM.html

28-06-2020||India||When will there be talk of nation’s security? Rahul Gandhi asks PM Modi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he would address India’s security issues.“When will there be talk of nation’s security?” Gandhi tweeted after the Prime Minister in his Mann Ki Baat praised Indian soldiers for giving “a befitting reply to those coveting our territories”.Referring to the violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on the night of June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers the commanding officer of the Bihar Regiment dead, Modi said, “Our brave soldiers have shown that they will not let any harm be done to Mother India’s pride.” The Congress has been hammering away at the PM and the government for inconsistent stands on the actual situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh amid the standoff with the Chinese.On Saturday, Congress leader Kapil Sibal claimed that the Chinese have intruded 18 km across the LAC at once location and asked PM Modi to “condemn the brazen Chinese occupation in Ladakh”.Sibal had targeted the PM for his statement at an all-party meeting that “no one intruded into Indian territory” that was in stark contrast to the statement of the Indian ambassador in Beijing who said China should de-escalate and disengage by “moving back to its side of LAC”. Sibal showed photographs to claim that the Chinese have intruded into several places in Indian territory and have cut off Indian patrols at five patrol points in the Ladakhi outback along the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-will-there-be-talk-of-nation-s-security-rahul-gandhi-asks-pm-modi/story-eEM4HoGFtS2QIysOhKMXeM.html

28-06-2020||India||Locust swarm seen in Gurugram now in UP’s Kasganj||The swarm of locusts which was seen in different parts of Delhi NCR including Gurugram and south Delhi on Saturday has reached Kasganj in western Uttar Pradesh after an unsuccessful attempt to control it, a top official of the Locust Warning Organisation said on Sunday.“We couldn’t control the entire swarm. They flew again early on Sunday morning. We have arranged for drones, fire brigades, apart from seven teams with sprayer mounted on vehicles. We are trying our best to control it. Control operations will begin again tonight. Teams are moving with the swarm,” said K L Gurjar, deputy director, Locust Warning Organisation.LWO also has several teams in Rajasthan that are trying to control fresh swarms coming in from Pakistan and Iran. “Control operations have been strengthened at the border to ensure swarms don’t come in,” Gurjar said. Meanwhile with monsoon approaching the arid regions of Rajasthan, breeding of locusts have started in several pockets, Gurjar had said on Saturday. “Locusts have laid eggs and hoppers have emerged. But we will manage to control these hoppers immediately.”The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) released its Desert Locust Situation update on Saturday evening where it said that although control operations continue, a general northerly movement of swarms will occur in three countries. Some of the swarms in northwest Kenya are expected to transit through South Sudan to reach the summer breeding areas of Sudan where some rains have already started. If these rains are not enough, there is a risk that swarms could continue to eastern Chad and spread westwards across the northern Sahel of West Africa. Swarms that accumulate in northern Somalia are likely to migrate across the Indian Ocean to the summer breeding areas along the Indo-Pakistan border.“In Southwest Asia, spring-bred swarms are present along both sides of the Indo-Pakistan border where they are awaiting the onset of the monsoon rains that will start in the coming days and allow the swarms to mature and lay eggs. Control operations continue,” the update said adding that swarms and adult groups in India are mainly present in Rajasthan west of Jaipur but some infestations continue to be reported in parts of Madhya Pradesh and southern Uttar Pradesh.“There are successive breeding cycles in the Horn of Africa. Some swarms from there are moving towards west Africa while some are moving towards Saudi Arabia, Oman and Yemen. These can also come to India in July. Some are expected to directly move to India from the Horn of Africa with the monsoon winds,” Gurjar said.“The winds are moving from the direction of the Horn of Africa towards India. The wind direction is south-westerly during monsoon. I will not be able to comment on whether they will carry these swarms with them,” M Mohapatra, director general, India Meteorological Department had said last week.While so far, the impact on food security due to locust invasions hasn’t been much, LWO said the Kharif crop especially maize and cotton is likely to be impacted if the two locust threats—from Indian Ocean and from breeding sites in India aren’t controlled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/locust-swarm-seen-in-gurugram-now-in-up-s-kasganj/story-CwZyS7PKV5OTOnMlQsQQ7L.html
28-06-2020||India||‘Delhi won’t have 5.5 lakh Covid-19 cases by July end, Manish Sisodia’s comments created fear’: Amit Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah has said he disagrees with Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia that the national capital will have 5.5 lakh Covid-19 cases by the end of July.“Around the second week of June, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that by July 31 there will be 5.5 lakh persons infected with the virus. He said that there will be no place left, no beds left and the situation will be difficult. This created a lot of fear in the minds of people in Delhi,” Shah said in an interview to news agency ANI.“I do not want to go into whether estimate was right or wrong. But a situation of fear arose and some people started mulling an exodus (out of Delhi),” he added. Also Watch | ‘Manish Sisodia’s 5.5 lakh Covid cases by July remark spread fear’: Amit ShahShah also said that there is no community transmission in Delhi. “I have talked to three senior-most officials - Dr Paul (from Niti Aayog), ICMR chief Dr Bhargava and Dr Guleria (AIIMS New Delhi Director). This situation has not come to Delhi. Such situation appeared because of the total tests done, earlier 30 per cent turned out to be positive and that was happening because tests were done at the last moment. Now that we have started doing 20,000 tests on average, this condition is not there. I have held technical discussions on this...today this situation is not there in Delhi. There is no need to fear,” the home minister told ANI.On June 9, Sisodia had said that the cases in Delhi would rise to 2.5 lakh by July 15 and the government would require 33,000 beds. He further told mediapersons that till July 31, there will be 5.5 lakh cases in the national capital.Sisodia was addressing a press briefing after a meeting called to discuss if there was community transmission of Covid-19 cases in Delhi.“I can say now with confidence that situation of 5.5 lakh cases will not come on July 31,” Shah said on Sunday, adding that a crucial meeting was called after Sisodia’s comment.The Centre stepped in after the spike of Covid-19 cases in the national capital. Shah held a series of meetings with Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and even the civic officials of the national capital to understand the situation and launch a programme to check the rapid spread of the coronavirus disease.A revised plan to combat Covid-19 was formulated and the Delhi government started door-to-door surveys which are expected to complete by June 30. The Centre had emphasised on increasing testing and formulating a plan for containment zones.A serological survey also began in some parts of Delhi on Saturday - the announcement was made by the Union home ministry spokesperson on Thursday. Blood samples will be taken from randomly selected people as part of the survey, which involves rapid tests for antibodies, to study the scale of undetected infections.Samples of 20,000 people will be tested by July 10 to ascertain the population-level presence of the IgG antibody, which indicates past infection.Kejriwal, meanwhile, announced that his government was deploying “five weapons” - testing and isolation, providing oximeters and oxygen concentrators, plasma therapy, screening, and survey - in the fight against the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-s-won-t-have-5-5-lakh-covid-19-cases-by-july-end-manish-sisodia-s-comments-created-fear-amit-shah/story-3CXgLTgNaIiC30CzMaQUkJ.html

28-06-2020||India||4 magnitude earthquakes strike Andaman and Nicobar and Manipur||Two earthquakes were reported in the country on Sunday, the National Centre for Seismology (NCS) reported.The first earthquake struck near Diglipur, in Andaman and Nicobar islands at 8:56 am at a depth of 45 kilometre, the NCS said. It was a 4.1 magnitude quake, it further reported.The second earthquake - with magnitude 4 - was reported near Ukhrul in Manipur at 11:24 am at a depth of 60 kilometre.Two quakes were reported from Rohtak in Haryana and Hanle in Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday. These are the series of quakes the country has been experiencing in the last few months.National capital Delhi has recorded more than 16 earthquakes in two months. Most of these, however, were very mild and only recorded by seismographs.The string of earthquakes or tremors have sparked concerns that a bigger quake could strike the national capital region. Seismologists say the increased frequency does not necessarily imply that a major one is coming but stress that monitoring them is key to being prepared. Unlike many other natural disasters, earthquakes cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty.The NCS said that most of the small earthquakes recorded around Delhi since April this year were along lineaments.A lineament is a linear feature corresponding to a fault - such as a valley or a mountain range. There are several faults in and around Delhi: Mathura fault, Moradabad fault, Delhi-Haridwar ridge, Delhi-Sargodha fault, Mahendergarh and Dehradun fault.Delhi falls under the fourth-highest zone in India, making it vulnerable to earthquakes. But there haven’t been too many earthquakes which have its epicentre in the national capital. Delhi mostly experiences tremors when a quake hits regions as far as central Asia or the Himalayan ranges, known to be a high-seismic zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-magnitude-earthquakes-strike-andaman-and-nicobar-and-manipur/story-6kRCJMpvrgTGu8Zc2hb9oI.html
28-06-2020||India||In Ladakh, India gave a befitting reply to those coveting our territories: PM Modi on Mann ki Baat||India gave a befitting response to those who eyed Indian territory in Ladakh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday referring to the violent stand-off between India and China along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh without naming China. Indian and Chinese troops had clashed in Galwan Valley on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army soldiers, including the commanding officer of 16 Bihar Regiment, were killed. India has shown the world its sense of fraternity during the coronavirus pandemic as well its strength and commitment to protecting its sovereignty and borders, PM Modi said as he addressed Mann Ki Baat, his monthly radio programme.“In Ladakh, a befitting reply has been given those coveting ur territories. India knows how to maintain friendships but it can also look someone in the eye and retaliate and give an apt reply,” PM Modi said during the 66th episode of Mann Ki Baat. “Our brave soldiers have shown that they will not let any harm be done to Mother India’s pride. India bows to our brave martyrs. They have always kept India safe. Their valour will always be remembered,” he added. This is the first Mann Ki Baat episode after the face-off in Ladakh. The Prime Minister also extended his condolences to the families of the soldiers who were killed in the Galwan Valley clash.“The inner sense of pride that families feel on the supreme sacrifice of their brave sons and their sentiment for the country, constitutes the true power and the might of the country.”The external affairs ministry has squarely blamed China for the standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), saying China had massed troops along the disputed frontier since May, violated a recent understanding to disengage in Galwan Valley and disregarded all mutually agreed norms for border patrols.Accusing China of triggering several face-offs by trying to unilaterally change the status quo along the LAC, the Indian side rejected the Chinese side’s “unjustified and untenable” claim on Galwan Valley. The statement also acknowledged both sides “remain deployed in large numbers in the region”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-ladakh-india-gave-a-befitting-reply-to-those-coveting-our-territories-pm-modi-on-mann-ki-baat/story-U0p89jm5o8Dw1AgkJ8RpYN.html

With this in mind, we have to continue our forward march fighting the challenges. If 130 crore Indians will march forward with this feeling, then this year can transform into the year of achievements,” PM Modi said in his monthly radio address Mann ki Baat.“The country can achieve new goals, take new strides and touch new heights,” he added.The prime minister started his address by highlighting the problems faced by the country in the year 2020. He said that not just Covid-19, earthquakes, cyclones (Amphan and Nisarga), locust attack and border face-off were also reported this year. “One rarely has heard or seen as many disasters of such magnitude taking place at the same time,” said PM Modi.But he asked people to not give up hope. “Problems and crisis do come in our lives but should we label the year 2020 as a bad year because of these challenges? Is it correct to believe that the whole year will be as the first six months? Not at all. My dear countrymen, absolutely not,” said the prime minister.“It was thought that India will lose its identity and culture. On the contrary, it added to the brilliance and glory of the nation which was guided by its strong cultural ethos,” added PM Modi.He also talked about the Ladakh face-off in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed and said that though India knows how to fulfil its commitment in friendship, it has given befitting reply in Ladakh to those who eyed its territory. “The world has seen India’s commitment to protecting its borders & sovereignty.

It occurs every summer,” said National Weather Service (NWS) meteorologist Patrick Blood.This year, the dust is the most dense it has been in a half a century, news agency Reuters reported quoting several meteorologists. Saharan dust is causing unhealthy air quality across large sections of the South and Ohio Valley. Another bad air quality day is ahead tomorrow: https://t.co/PQW8IyqAeQ pic.twitter.com/pWidUnZnHcThe current dust storm is expected to hang over the region until the middle of next week, deteriorating the air quality in Texas, Florida and other states where the number of Covid-19 cases has recently spiked.“There’s emerging evidence of potential interactions between air pollution and the risk of Covid, so at this stage we are concerned,” said Gregory Wellenius, a professor of environmental health at Boston University’s School of Public Health.Air pollution can be especially detrimental for people who are at risk for or suffer from cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses, Wellenius added. Heart and lung problems heighten the risk of severe Covid-19.The plume created hazy skies and lower visibility, according to the pictures shared by many residents of FLorida, Texas and other US States. Sahara dust arrives in New Orleans#SaharanDust #SaharanAirLayer #DustPlume pic.twitter.com/vyuU8ikMVV The #SaharanDust has arrived in Galveston, Texas! 👀 No spectacular, colorful sunrise this morning. 😕@Plume_Labs says air quality has dropped to unhealthy levels at the coast. ☁️ We’ll have another #SaharanAirLayer live report at 8:30a EDT / 7:30a CDT on @accuweather 📺 pic.twitter.com/p9SgnGDAyxOn June 18, NASA noted the thickest parts of the dust storm appeared to stretch about 1,500 miles across the Atlantic Ocean.

The epidemic also taught India, he added, to be “self-reliant”.“With timely lockdown India successfully protected the lives of thousands and lakhs of its citizens,” the prime minister said in a video address streamed live to a virtual annual meeting of the American Association of Physicians of Indian origin. “Contrary,” he had said earlier, “to fears expressed by experts around the world that India could be in deep crisis.”PM Modi said that Covid-19 fatalities were less than 12 for every 1 million people in India - “not even 12”, he repeated to emphasise the low number - compared, in his telling, to more than 350 in the United States and more than 600 for the UK, Spain and Italy. The United States leads the world in both the death toll and infections with over 1,25,000 and 2.4 respectively, and they are both growing.“If India today has been able to fight the coronavirus (he used the shorter form “corona”) so much better,” the prime minister said, adding, “the lockdown played a very big role in it.” He spoke mostly in Hindi.While fighting the pandemic, India used the time period of the lockdown to “ramp up” its healthcare system, he said. It was able to expand the number of hospital beds for special Covid-19 treatment and isolation chamber, grow the number of labs to test coronavirus infections from one to more than 1,000, the prime minister said detailing the outcomes. He added that till three months ago, India was a net importer of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs), testing kits and even N-95 masks. Today, India produces four millions PPEs a week and three million N-95s.“We used to import earlier, and now we are moving towards exporting them,” he said.Even ventilators, which are needed for severely ill and hospitalised patients, were mostly imported earlier, whereas 50,000 of those made in India are in the process of being deployed.“It’s said that every crisis teaches us something or the other,” Modi said, adding, “corona has taught India to be self-reliant.” And this will help further strengthen the healthcare system.The prime minister went on to give a detailed account of his government’s approach on health and initiatives such as on eradication of tuberculosis (TB) and mitigation of Kala-azar (Black Fever, also called visceral leishmaniasis).“Our pehchan (identity),” he said, “is linked to manawta (humanity) not money.”As the Covid-19 epidemic spread around the world, India supplied medicines and medical equipment to more than 150 countries and provided training to personnel of 16 countries, he said, adding, India sent hydroxychloroquine to many counties “including America”.India was now working with many countries on finding a vaccine for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/timely-lockdown-helped-india-fight-covid-19-pm-modi-tells-indian-descent-us-doctors/story-kppk81Lj2L27kYyPAD3UsL.html

28-06-2020||India||Covid-19 pandemic prompts a changed world order||The world was in flux before the coronavirus pandemic. Central tenets of the international order that were institutionalised after the Second World War in 1945 and reinforced — with greater gusto — after the end of the Cold War in 1991, were up for question. And, each nation was revising its own political and philosophical approach to the world, and its own place in it. The United States (US) took an unprecedented inward turn with the election of Donald Trump as president in 2016, retreating from the very institutions, economic principles and military outreach that helped it become a superpower and sustain its power. China, under President Xi Jinping, had shown signs of giving up on the principle laid out by Deng Xiaoping to build its internal strength and bide its time on the international stage, by launching the most aggressive global initiative in modern times — the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), expanding its definition of “core interests”, and projecting power both in its vicinity and beyond. Russia, dismissed after the collapse of the Soviet Union as a “has been” power re-emerged as a key player, expanding its influence, expanding its territorial reach, playing a more active role in West Asia, and deepening its partnerships with new actors such as China. The United Kingdom went through Brexit and formalised its exit from the European Union, posing an existential question to the most audacious transnational political-economic-security arrangement ever conceived in the continent that had seen nationalism lead to devastating wars. It was not just actions of particular states, but the fundamentals of international cooperation that were up in the air. The relatively liberal economic regime — premised on the free flow of goods and services, regional and bilateral trading arrangements, and greater openness to movement of people reflected in immigration — was cracking. Surprisingly, or perhaps not so surprisingly, the attack on it came from the same western powers that conceptualised it in the first place, but were now unwilling to bear the costs as economic activity shifted elsewhere. Technology became the new frontier of cooperation and competition. It had connected the world as never before, and changed the way individuals led their lives, companies conducted their businesses, and states interacted. But it also became an additional tool in the diplomatic and military arsenal of the big powers, and control over key technological infrastructure — from the cyber commons to 5G — became a site of global contestation. The pandemic has not changed the world and ushered in a new era. What it has done is intensify and expedite underlying trends which were visible in international politics, and made the world confront a new reality in a period of a few months what would have taken several years. Also read | Eight states account for 87% of Covid deaths, 85% active cases THE “CHINA VIRUS”With Covid-19 originating in Wuhan, as the pandemic spread, US president Donald Trump took to calling Sars-Cov-2 the “China virus”. This was seen as an attempt to deflect his own failures in managing the pandemic on to an external rival; it also reflected the tensions in the US-China relationship. While there remains a widespread consensus that China needs to be called out for its initial missteps in handling the disease, the dominant international view is that it is important not to politicise the pandemic by naming it after China, for it will only deepen divisions and can lead to social tensions. What, then, are these trends? First, the return of nationalism. At a time when Covid-19 is ravaging the world and reflecting the cross-cutting, cross-border, transnational nature of threats to humanity — one case in a city in China has now led to over nine million people getting infected, and close to half-million deaths, worldwide — nationalism has returned with a vengeance. Instead of the pandemic bringing home the message of inter-connectedness and that all countries need to swim together, or they will all sink, the pandemic has brought home another message: you are on your own. The national lockdowns; the prolonged interruptions to international travel; the search — desperate search — in each country for testing kits, hospital beds, personal protective equipment and related health infrastructure tools; the reliance on the local or national, over the international, to sustain supply chains have all made borders the most salient feature of international politics again. THE WHO CRISISThe World Health Organization is in the middle of its most serious crisis since its founding in 1948. And it is just not because of the serious health emergency that has hit the world. Seen as complicit in China’s initial attempts to underplay the disease, the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has come under particular criticism for the delay in officially alerting the world about the existence of the pandemic, issuing conflicting advisories on health protocols, among other steps. The United States, under Donald Trump, has taken on the WHO — first cutting funding, and then announcing a decision to walk out of the body. Borders never went away; they are in fact the very foundation of the sovereign international state system. But those who thought that borders would become irrelevant can bid adieu to their dreams. From Trump’s decision to tighten immigration rules to India’s decision to launch an economic campaign for self-reliance, nation-states have returned as the most powerful unit in the world order. Second, the death-blow to multilateralism. International cooperation rests on states ceding a degree of their sovereign rights of decision making to conform to an internationally agreed upon set of norms. With the return of nationalism, and intensified conflicts, states are unwilling to cede any authority to a supra-national body. Before the pandemic, this was reflected in Trump’s disdain for the United Nations or the collapse of the dispute settlement mechanism of the World Trade Organization. But it has become far more acute in the wake of the pandemic, reflected most starkly in the politics around the World Health Organization (WHO). THE PANDEMIC IN THE US As the pandemic spread, developed democracies in the west — particularly United States and United Kingdom, but also other nations in Europe — were badly affected. The surge in cases and deaths exposed the governance weaknesses of these states. US president Donald Trump, in particular, swung from underestimating the perils of the disease to encouraging protesters against curtailed movement and economic activity, which led to more cases. Many observers see the moment as the beginning of the end of the US dominance in international politics.By any yardstick, WHO should be the most important organisation at a time when the world is facing its most severe health emergency in a century. But, and here is the paradox, rarely has the WHO been as mired in controversy. Seen as partisan to China, WHO lost its credibility as an impartial stakeholder. Trump’s decision to first cut the funding, and then an announcement that US would walk away from WHO, only eroded its capital further. The world, therefore, lacks an effective body that has the respect of all sides and authority and power to ensure peace and security (the UN Security Council is weak); it lacks an effective body to govern international economic arrangements (WTO’s power is deeply curtailed); and it lacks an effective transnational health organisation. The pandemic’s second message, therefore, is don’t look to the world for support. BELLIGERENT BEIJINGEven as the international community sought accountability from China for the pandemic, Beijing — after focusing on tackling the disease in the first few months of the year — decided to use the moment to both turn internally more repressive and externally more assertive. It stepped up its offensive against Taiwan, eroded Hong Kong’s autonomous status, allegedly launched a cyber offensive against Australia, attacked a Vietnamese vessel in the South China Sea, and encroached on Indian territory. Third, the retreat of globalisation. This again is a paradox for global economic integration is possibly the best way to recover from the global recession. But the fact that there has been brewing resentment in the West — particularly among the working class — about the perceived loss of opportunities due to these interlinkages had already led to the rise of economic nationalists.Trade wars had broken out before the pandemic itself but the pandemic brought home both the importance of securing one’s own supply chains, generating employment through manufacturing at home, and reducing dependence on China. States are now developing a new attitude. Foreign investment is okay — as long as it is coming to me. Trade is okay — as long as it is skewed in my favour. Technological cooperation is fine — but I will not cede control of my critical infrastructure. Migration is fine — but only within bounds, in a very restrictive manner, and only if those who come are sorely needed. The third message from the pandemic is, therefore, build your economy yourself. THE INDIA-CHINA CLASH One of the most significant events in the last 100 days has been the border clash between India and China in eastern Ladakh on June 15, when 20 personnel of the Indian Army and an unconfirmed number of Chinese People’s Liberation Army personnel were killed. The clash came in the wake of China attempting to change the facts on the ground at the Line of Actual Control, breaching past agreements. The episode has the potential to alter the Asian balance of power, push India closer to the United States, and deepen India-China rivalry across the board. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the pandemic has led to China signalling that it would no longer be constrained by international norms, past agreements and the idea of its “peaceful rise”, and assert its power. The paradox here is that it was in China that the coronavirus disease originated but China may end up emerging as the most powerful entity after the pandemic. It has eroded Hong King’s autonomous status through a repressive national security legislation; it has launched cyber offensives against Australia; it has yet again asserted its claims in the South China Sea, attacking Vietnamese and Malaysian vessels; it has stepped up its offensive against Japan; and, of course, it has attempted to change the facts on the ground on the border with India, violated past agreements, and killed, brutally, 20 personnel of the Indian army. THE END OF GLOBALISATION?US president Donald Trump decided to suspend work visas affecting a wide range of sectors of the US economy and foreign nationals. The move was a reflection of the acceleration in the inward turn of countries. While global movement of people was always more restrictive than the flow of goods and services, Trump’s move is in line with his general approach to global economic interlinkages. But it is not just him. Countries have turned more protectionist, encouraging local industry, and stepping back on WTO commitments, with implications for global supply chains. Also read | ‘Serious problem’: China, US battle threat of new wave of Covid-19 casesThe world increasingly faces a choice. Will countries give into these Chinese attempts to overturn the international order, accept Beijing’s actions, and subscribe to all that comes with it — its authoritarian structure, its disdain for individual freedom, its sense of exceptionalism where all others are lower down the hierarchy and the Middle Kingdom is at the top, its attempts to dominate on land and sea the rest of Asia, and its semi-imperial enterprise of the BRI? Or will they come together to contain China’s untrammelled use of power — even while engaging with it — and force it to continue subscribing to the basic precepts of the liberal international order? The fourth, and the most significant, message of the pandemic is, therefore, simple — accept China’s hegemony or get ready for a long battle ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-pandemic-prompts-a-changed-world-order/story-pJslWpzI3z4Ub71nsEHkiM.html

28-06-2020||India||Cong urges PM to retract June 19 statement on LAC clash with China||The Congress on Saturday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to “retract” his statements made at the all-party meeting on the Galwan Valley skirmish with China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) that left 20 Indian Army soldiers dead on June 15. Addressing a virtual press conference, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal said, “It is not too late for the PM to retract his ill-advised misstatements. When India’s security is in issue no Prime Minister should hesitate to state facts to build trust. Otherwise the Chinese will use his statement to their advantage which will hurt us persuading our friends globally.” The PM’s statements must be based on facts and instil confidence, he said. During the all-party meeting on June 19, the PM had said, “No one has intruded into our territory. No one is present in our territory. None of our posts are in possession of anyone.”Sibal said, “But yesterday Indian Ambassador to China in an interview said that India hopes China will realise its responsibility in de-escalation and disengagement by moving back to its side of the LAC.”Sibal was referring to Indian ambassador in Beijing, Vikram Misri, comments made during an interview to news agency PTI on Friday. Misri said, “India hopes China will realise its responsibility in de-escalation and disengaging by moving back to its side of LAC.”The Congress had earlier sought a clarification on the PM’s remarks alleging that both the defence and the external affairs ministry had acknowledged the presence of Chinese troops on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-urges-pm-to-retract-june-19-statement-on-lac-clash-with-china/story-LIvvEPJwLmJz21cM8i7NqK.html
28-06-2020||India||Jobless Telangana teachers turn to manual labour||Payili Satyanarayana, 32, taught at a private school in Telangana’s Suryapet town until the Covid-19 pandemic turned his life upside down. He was forced to return to his village in Nalgonda district with his wife and eight-month-old son when the lockdown imposed to check the pandemic spread forced the closure of the school and left him jobless. Satyanarayana was paid one-third of his salary in March before the school management said it could no longer pay him. Left with no other source of income to survive, Satyanarayana enrolled under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme under which at least one member of every rural household is guaranteed 100-day manual work annually. “I was paid ₹150 daily for desilting work at a local tank. But that was hardly enough. Later, I joined as a labourer in cotton fields, where I am getting around ₹300 daily,” said Satyanarayana, who has a master’s degree in Telugu literature.He said he worked as a teacher for a paltry salary of ₹15,000 a month. “Yet, it was a noble profession with respect in society.” He said if he starts thinking about his qualification, he would die of starvation.Satyanarayana’s situation mirrors that of many like Zaheer Ahmed Sheik, 40. Sheik worked as a Hindi teacher but is now forced to eke out a living loading and unloading gas cylinders at a warehouse for ₹500 weekly.Sheik, who is from Mancherial district in Telangana, earned ₹15,000 monthly till the pandemic left him jobless. “Since I could not survive in Hyderabad without a job, I returned to my town and have been working at the warehouse... I have also been painting buildings. In all, I am earning ₹5,000 a month,” said Zaheer, a father of two. “When I think about the future, I get scared.”Tumki Praveen, a mathematics teacher from Jagitial town, ended up as a fruit seller after losing his private school job. “What else could I do? I do not have money even to do a petty business.”Telangana Private Teachers Federation president Sheik Shabbir Ali said there are 11,700 recognised private schools in the state and most of their teachers have lost jobs. “As per the official statistics, 1,20,350 teachers were working in these schools, but unofficially the number is more than 250,000.”Ali said many prestigious schools have resumed online classes but they too have engaged fewer teachers. “In many districts, several big schools have formed groups and are engaging common teachers to take online classes...”Telangana private school managements’ association president Papi Reddy said the private schools were aware of the plight of the teachers but they were also helpless because of the uncertainty in Covid-19 pandemic.“There is no possibility of the schools being reopened even partially, unless the Covid-19 cases come down to a minimum level. The government is also not willing to take risk in allowing students. Many private schools are facing the threat of closure due to huge financial losses because of lockdown,” he said.He admitted that there were schools which evaded payment of salaries to the teachers but hastened to add that they would have certainly paid the arrears after the reopening of the schools.In the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, too, the situation is no different. Many private school teachers have been forced to sell vegetables and even work as construction and daily wage workers.“I earned a lot of respect among students as a maths teacher and principal of a private school. But now, I have lost my job and am forced to go from street to street to sell eggs,” said Nageshwara Rao from West Godavari district.Andhra Pradesh Private School Teachers’ Union president Didde Ambedkar said there are over 12,000 recognised private schools in the state that employed 125,000 teachers. “Many schools have not paid salaries to their teachers since February, much before the lockdown was imposed.”While school education secretary Chitra Ramachandran could not be reached for comment, an officer on special duty in the department said the state government was not in a position to take any decision on reopening of schools due to rising Covid-19 cases. “We are awaiting a direction from National Council of Education Research and Training (NCERT). We shall take a call after seeing the guidelines of the NCERT,” he said.National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) executive committee member Dr K Ramdas said neither the private schools nor the government could be blamed for the present situation. “As I understand, it is not possible to open schools, at least primary schools, till December, because no parent will be willing to take risk by sending his children to the school,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jobless-telangana-teachers-turn-to-manual-labour/story-5vrtE6OfHGkNueNWydqhNJ.html
28-06-2020||India||OPDs in Delhi’s Ganga Ram to reopen from July 1||Sir Ganga Ram hospital will reopen its outpatient clinics July 1 onwards, with precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The clinics were closed on March 22, days before the national lockdown was announced.The hospital used to receive around 1,700 to 1,800 patients in its clinics every day before the lockdown. The clinics will be operated in a “Covid Safe Area” between 8am and 8pm.“We are taking sufficient precautions to safeguard the health of patients. All our chambers are located in the ‘Covid Safe Area’. Our hospital will ensure the best infection control measures,” said Dr DS Rana, chairman of the board of management of Sir Gangaram Hospital.The government has dedicated 80% of the hospital’s beds for the treatment of Covid-19. Several hospitals in the city—government and private —had closed their out-patient services in view of Covid-19. Some had re-opened them from April 14.Others, like Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, are still in the process of reopening their clinics while ensuring patient safety.The hospital has about 40 chambers on the ground floor which is completely segregated and has a separate entry from the Covid areas. Only one person will be allowed in one chamber at a time, according to the hospital.“There is a screening tent outside the OPD entrance where the patient’s temperature and symptoms will be checked and we will allow only the patient to go inside. We will allow a family member inside only in dire situations. Once a patient receives a consultation and leaves the room, it will be sanitised before another patient is allowed inside,” a hospital staff personnel said.All the doctors in the clinics will be in complete personal protective gear, including full-body suits. Patients will need no appointment at the OPDs.The hospital- one of the busiest private hospitals in the city- has been working at nearly 45% of the doctor strength in its OPDs for the past couple of months.“From 45 OPDs running six days in a week, with about 40 to 50 patients per OPD, we have reduced consultations to about 10-12 patients per OPD. There are no more than 15 OPDs running two-three days in a week. We have been extra cautious,” said Mili Sehgal, OPD in-charge at the hospital.Several patients have been suffering due to the shutdown of the OPDs as well as the delay in surgeries.The state government had asked the hospital to convert itself into a Covid facility last month, and the hospital has been working to make the required arrangements, causing delays, and inconvenience to patients as a result.Patients said they felt the panic among hospital staff. “There is too much panic; you can see the staff being extra cautious, which is understandable as this disease is highly infectious. We are grateful that at least our patient was admitted and treatment was started here. There were other smaller hospitals in our area but we had heard they weren’t admitting Covid patients, and that’s why we came here,” Rakesh Kumar, whose uncle, an unconfirmed Covid-19 case, is undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit, said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opds-in-delhi-s-ganga-ram-to-reopen-from-july-1/story-kk52fh6TVjzNoCpXdk20wN.html

Nagar is not saying anything on it,” he said.Another police officer privy to the incident said that the two constables first had an altercation at a tea stall near the police station in the evening, which was resolved by some other officials.Meanwhile, some officials said that Nagar was upset about a recent change in Bhadana’s charge. “Bhadana had been recently given the charge of a police beat falling under the territorial jurisdiction of the Seemapuri police station after Nagar was removed from that beat by senior officers. Nagar was unhappy about this,” said a police officer, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-cop-shoots-colleague-inside-police-station/story-8CmU15evIQBf7W3VYhQzbI.html
28-06-2020||India||Sero survey in Delhi begins to map exposure to coronavirus||A serological survey began in some parts of Delhi on Saturday to determine the extent of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)’s spread, even as chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said his government was deploying “five weapons” – testing and isolation, providing oximeters and oxygen concentrators, plasma therapy, screening, and survey – in the fight against the infection. Blood samples will be taken from randomly selected people as part of the survey, which involves rapid tests for antibodies, to study the scale of undetected infections. Samples of 20,000 people will be tested by July 10 to ascertain the population-level presence of the IgG antibody, which indicates past infection. The activity will take place along with door-to-door screening in the Capital and increased testing for Covid-19.On Saturday, Delhi began the study in the Central district, which conducted about 700 blood tests. The Capital reported 2,948 Covid-19 cases on Saturday, taking the total infections in the city to 80,188. Delhi has reported 2,558 deaths so far from the infectious disease. The number of fresh cases across the nation surpassed the 20,000 mark for the first time, with 20,179 new infections.The results of the current study will be used as baseline data and such drives will be conducted periodically to monitor the trend of the infection in the community, according to the training material provided by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), which is spearheading the study. The survey is part of a new Covid-19 response plan prepared by the Delhi health department, in accordance with the recommendations of a committee headed by NITI Aayog member VK Paul. The Centre and the Delhi government agreed on deploying a revamped strategy against the disease in the Capital at a recent meeting chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah.Also read | Covid-19 pandemic prompts a changed world orderTeams of lab technicians and auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) posted at government dispensaries and mohalla clinics will visit households and draw blood samples in all 11 districts of the Capital.On the first day of the survey, the Central district created 30 teams for the exercise, which is also called sero-surveillance. The other districts were in the process of arranging logistics, training the ground staff, and surveying their respective areas to select households. A senior revenue department official with the Delhi government said on condition of anonymity: “We are in the process of making arrangements and training the staff for it. We have started with the Central district and will scale it up from tomorrow (Sunday). From Monday, it will start in all the districts.”The New Delhi district, which will collect the lowest number of samples (169) based on the size of its population, will begin the exercise on Monday. The highest number of samples will be collected by the Northwest.In the East and West districts, the staff that will be deployed for sample collection were being trained on Saturday. “There is a protocol which has to be followed. We have formed close to 25-plus teams, one per dispensary, to carry out the survey. The areas where the teams will go have been finalised as per the guidelines provided to us,” said a senior official with the East district, requesting anonymity.The exercise is being jointly carried out by NCDC, which functions under the Union health ministry, and the Delhi government. “The serological survey has started from Saturday and will cover 20,000 people. The survey is being conducted door to door and will reveal the extent of coronavirus spread in Delhi,” chief minister Kejriwal said.He said Delhi was waging a difficult war against the Covid-19 pandemic and will emerge victorious, but it will take time. The Delhi government is combating the pandemic by augmenting hospital beds, increasing the number of tests, providing oximeters and oxygen concentrators to patients in home isolation, providing plasma therapy to patients, and through survey and screening, the CM said.Also read | The science behind Delhi’s five-pronged fight against Covid In the past one month, the number of beds was raised significantly at hospitals and now there was no lack of beds; out of 13,500 available, 7,500 were vacant, he added. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia tweeted: “Sero Testing has been started from today in the fight against Corona in Delhi. Under this, 20 thousand blood sample will be taken from all over Delhi. This test will prove to be very effective in the Delhi government’s campaign against Corona.” Explaining the process of the serological survey, a doctor with the West district said: “Our teams will be sent to 10-15 points or areas identified by us.”In the North district, five teams have been formed. Each team will have a lab technician, a pharmacist, ANMs and ASHA workers. The teams will be supervised by a doctor, a senior doctor with the district said, asking not to be named. For random selection of the households, each ward in Delhi will be divided into four areas and the households will be selected using a list of homes available with the dispensary in the area. In the absence of such a list, the teams have been directed to stand in the middle of the areas designated to them and identify one household at random. The next household will be selected at an interval of about 5 or 10 houses, according to the methodology. “We have been given a ward-wise break-up of the number of households that have to be included for the study. We have to randomly select these households – for example, if we start from one point of a locality, then we collect samples from house number 1, 5, 10… like that. If a house is locked or people do not consent to be a part of the study, we will move to the next house,” a doctor from the Central district said on condition of anonymity.At least 30% of the samples from each ward have to be from children (1 to 18 years of age). For the study, only those people who have been living in the city for at least six months will be included.The teams have to carry a questionnaire (about the health of the participant, travel or contact history), consent forms, blood collection kits, boxes that are used for vaccinations, appropriate personal protective equipment and bags for the disposal of biomedical waste. Each team has to collect up to 40 samples. For every five survey teams, there will be a supervisory team consisting of medical officers from the dispensaries or mohalla clinics, along with an intern or final-year postgraduate student and a nodal officer from NCDC. Earlier this month, the Indian Council of Medical Research revealed the result of its pilot sero-surveillance study of 26,000 people from across India. The overall percentage of general population that was found to have been infected in the past is 0.73%, with urban areas having shown higher Covid-19 prevalence of about 1.09%, the study had revealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sero-survey-in-delhi-begins-to-map-exposure-to-coronavirus/story-WLyV0eADZWIQSikAD49b5J.html
28-06-2020||India||UN experts seek anti-CAA protesters’ release||The Office of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has asked India to immediately release activists arrested for protesting against the new Citizenship (Amendment) Act , or CAA.“These defenders, many of them students, appear to have been arrested simply because they exercised their right to denounce and protest against the CAA, and their arrest seems clearly designed to send a chilling message to India’s vibrant civil society that criticism of government policies will not be tolerated,” OHCHR said in a statement.In December, parliament passed a law to fast-track grant of Indian citizenship to six religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan -- Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis, Christians. A large number of groups and political parties have termed the law discriminatory because it left out the Muslims. Protests have taken place all across India since November last year demanding its withdrawal. In February,communal rioting erupted over CAA in Delhi in which 53 people were killed.The government has repeatedly claimed that CAA will be implemented at any cost and that opposition parties were spreading misconceptions about the new law which it said wouldn’t affect Indian Muslims.The OHCHR statement mentioned the case of pregnant Delhi student Safoora Zargar, who was released on bail on June 23.It said – “…Zargar was detained for over two months having allegedly been kept in conditions equating to solitary confinement, denied regular contact with her family and legal representative, and having not been provided adequate medical care or diet. She was finally granted bail on June 23, in her sixth month of pregnancy, on humanitarian grounds.”Others named by UN office in its statement included Meeran Haider, Gulfisha Fatima, Asif Iqbal Tanha, Devangana Kalita, Natasha Narwal, Khalid Saifi, Shifa Ur Rehman, Dr Kafeel Khan, Sharjeel Imam and Akhil Gogoi, who have been arrested over the past six-seven months.“Many of the 11 individual cases include serious allegations of human rights violations, several relating to due process failings during arrest and detention, as well as allegations of torture and ill-treatment,” it said.“Authorities should immediately release all human rights defenders who are currently being held in pre-trial detention without sufficient evidence, often simply on the basis of speeches they made criticising the discriminatory nature of the CAA,” the statement said.It said that the authorities were invoking counter-terrorism or national security legislation, and using procedural police powers, to deny bail to protesters and issue charges carrying heavy sentences.“Although demonstrations ended in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and India’s Supreme Court issued a recent order to decongest jails because of health concerns related to the pandemic, protest leaders continue to be detained. The reported spread of the virus in Indian prisons makes their immediate release all the more urgent,” the UN said.The UN, the statement said, was in contact with the Indian government on the matter.BJP MP Rakesh Sinha said: “CAA is law under Indian Constitution and provides relief to victims of religious majoritarianism in Pak Bangladesh and Afghanistan. I condemn the statement as unwise and against the international customs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/un-experts-seek-anti-caa-protesters-release/story-zK8yklFw2p5AkvsKhtOGPL.html
28-06-2020||India||Striking down NJAC flawed, says former AG Mukul Rohatgi||The 2015 Supreme Court judgment striking down the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) -- a body conceived by the Narendra Modi government for appointing judges to the Supreme Court and high courts -- is flawed and goes against the will of the people and the Constitutional mandate, senior counsel and former attorney general (AG) Mukul Rohatgi said on Saturday.Rohatgi, who argued the case on NJAC for the central government when he was AG, said the constitution empowers the President of India to appoint judges of the Supreme Court and high courts in consultation with the Chief Justice of India (CJI). But the Supreme Court interpreted the word “consultation” in the Constitution to mean “concurrence’ so as to give primacy to the CJI when it comes to judicial appointments, he said.“How can the line ‘President shall appoint a judge of Supreme Court in consultation with CJI’ mean ‘concurrence with CJI’? Dr.{Bhim Rao} Ambedkar would be turning in his grave (at the Supreme Court’s interpretation)”, Rohatgi said at a webinar, where he spoke on former Union minister late Arun Jaitley’s perspectives on justice dispensation and expectations of the judiciary.The NJAC, which was the brainchild of Jaitley, had sought to replace the Collegium system of appointing judges.The Collegium is a body of five senior-most judges of the Supreme Court which recommends the names of candidates for appointment as judges of the Supreme Court and high court. The names recommended by the Collegium are binding on the central government.The collegiums system itself was introduced by the Supreme Court through its 1993 judgment in the second judges case in which it held that the power to appoint judges is vested with the CJI and the central government cannot appoint a person as judge without the concurrence of the CJI and the four senior-most judges of the Supreme Court. This body of judges came to be called the Collegium – a system in which judges appoint judges.After the Modi government came to power in 2014, one of the first changes it brought to the Constitution was to include a new Article providing for the NJAC, a body comprised of representatives of the government and judiciary to appoint judges.“He (Jaitley) was clear that nowhere in the world, judges appoint judges. But our Supreme Court, interpreted ‘consultation’ as ‘concurrence’. NJAC may have had some flaws but not enough for Supreme Court to strike it down”, Rohatgi said, adding that Jaitley felt bitter about the court’s interpretation which he believed went against the will of the people.Rohatgi also expressed hope that the Supreme Court would realize its mistake and overturn its 2015 judgment.“In the Puttaswamy case (of 2017), Justice DY Chandrachud overturned his father’s judgment in ADM Jabalpur. I believe the Supreme Court will overturn its judgment on NJAC in the next two years”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/striking-down-njac-flawed-former-ag/story-ZLbuOyqGcsQKZrmy9AMO7O.html
28-06-2020||India||Nitin Gadkari highlights need for import substitution in MSMEs||Union minister for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) Nitin Gadkar on Saturday said “import substitution”, a term policy-makers use for economic self-reliance, was important for the country, underscoring the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s tilt toward a model of growth that seeks to boost exports and minimise imports. Gadkari, who spoke via videoconference at the launch of a report on MSMEs here, said the Covid-19 pandemic would likely end once a vaccine was found.“We are 100% going to win the Covid war. A vaccine will come. But the economic war is a long one...import substitute (substitution) is important.”“When I look at Varanasi, I get worried that it is importing silk from China. We have a good sericulture sector,” he said, adding local handloom and handicraft units needed a boost.On the occasion of MSME Day, Gadkari launched a report, Improving Economic Dynamism and Accelerating MSME Growth, brought out by the Global Alliance for Mass Entrepreneurship, a not-for-profit.Import substitution was the country’s main economic and industrial policy during the first few five-yearly plan periods. Such a policy focuses on replacing foreign imports with domestically produced goods. He said the government planned to have one industry in each panchayat, boost exports and rely on “import substitution” for growth and jobs. Gadkari said boosting exports of small and rural industries, creating a sustainable economy, with less pollution, decongestion of cities and building industrial hubs along 22 green expressways were priorities of the government. “Our 117 aspirational districts are low on many indicators. We are focusing on creating sustainable development in these districts,” the minister said.Small enterprises are the backbone of Indian manufacturing. They account for 29% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), have 22% share in exports and employ over 100 million people. The report on MSMEs launched by Gadkari recommends simplified communication of government schemes in local languages and easier access to funds for first-time borrowers.It also sought “an enabling business environment through simplification, digitization and decriminalization of compliances.” The lockdown imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19 has hit small businesses the most and 57% of these units are out of cash, the non-for-profit GAME said. The recommendations were made by a task force composed of corporate leaders, policy-makers, MSMEs representatives and academic experts, according to the report.“COVID is an existential threat particularly to smaller, informal firms. Estimates suggest that 30-40% may cease to exist. The sector urgently requires financial and regulatory support to keep businesses afloat,” Ravi Venkatesan, founder of GAME said. Venkatesan is a former chairman of Microsoft India. Participants in the conference included Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma, Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa and Punjab education minister Vijay Inder Singhal. Gadkari said his ministry would “work on” the report to finalise an agenda to implement the recommendations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gadkari-highlights-need-for-import-substitution-in-msmes/story-hHXAJBtuRfMATcfk41uBWI.html
28-06-2020||India||RSS wants govt to work on improving ties with Nepal||The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has expressed concern over the strain in the ties with Nepal and wants New Delhi to focus on rebuilding people-to-people ties with Kathmandu people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The ideological fount of the BJP, the RSS, has however backed India’s response to China following the violent face-off between the armies of the two sides in Ladakh on June 15.Both issues were discussed at a meeting between the RSS top brass and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) leadership earlier this week in New Delhi, the people cited above added.  RSS leaders present at the meeting, the people said, expressed concern that the government and the intelligence agencies were blindsided by developments in the neighbourhood and were worried at the deterioration in Indo-Nepal relations. “The meeting which was chaired by the RSS general secretary Suresh Bhaiyaji Joshi and attended by several RSS leaders, BJP president JP Nadda and BJP’s general secretary, organisations BL Santhosh was called to assess the situation brewing on the borders and to prepare for the ‘post- Covid’ developments,” said one of the people. He added that the meeting also discussed the possibility of opponents of the Citizenship Amendment Act launching another “Shaheen Bagh like protest” after the pandemic dies out. The reference is to an area in New Delhi where protestors against the law took over a road for months on end. The protest was effectively brought to an end by the pandemic. While the RSS has always advocated a muscular foreign policy to deal with Pakistan and China; it is concerned that India and Nepal have not been able to resolve issues through dialogue.Earlier this month Nepal’s Lower House of Parliament passed a constitutional amendment Bill revising the Coat of Arms and amending the country’s map to incorporate Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura areas, traditionally claimed by India. The RSS leadership has weighed in favour of revisiting trade ties with China; and after the clashes in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley that led to the killing of 20 Indian soldiers there is a concerted campaign to push the government to reset trade links and also elicit support from people for the same. But as far as Nepal is concerned, the Sangh wants the emphasis on people-to-people ties.“What started off as internal politics in Nepal has taken the shape of acrimony (between the two sides). There is a sense (in the RSS) that the bureaucracy took precedence over political engagement, which resulted in communication slip ups,” said a second person familiar with what transpired at the meeting. Referring to Nepal Army chief General Purna Chandra Thapa’s visit to inspect a security post in Kalapani, the second person added: “The Sangh does not favour any military l face-off between India and Nepal. It is concerned by the developments, but believes that these are being triggered at the behest of China. So it wants relations to be normalized between the two countries.”Sanjay Kumar of the Centre for Developing Studies said the RSS’s push for better relations with Nepal stems from the ideological similarities between the two countries. “There is an ideological connect between the Sangh and Nepal, a Hindu nation. Also, amending ties with them is easier than (doing so with) China.”Social equations between Indian and Nepalese also play a key role in pushing for friendly ties Kumar said. “There are family ties, marriages take place between the people on both sides and that plays an important role in establishing friendly relations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-wants-govt-to-work-on-improving-ties-with-nepal/story-EWI1BA4EKnKQKaNjk823uO.html
28-06-2020||India||Covid-19: New software in focus for registry of deaths||To address the need for realtime reporting of deaths caused by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), several states plan to use the e-mortality recording software developed by an institute under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).After Karnataka directed all hospitals to use the death registry software, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan are also finalising plans to adopt the software developed by the ICMR-National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (NCDIR), based in Bengaluru.“We have been using this software for a couple of years to record cause of death at our registry sites in 25 hospitals across India. It has been quite effective in documenting exact cause of death in a scientific manner,” said Dr Prashant Mathur, director, NCDIR. “The plan was to ask states to take this software up for registering all cause mortality but then Covid happened and many states approached us on their own showing interest in making use of this software. It will streamline the whole process,” Mathur added.The deaths that will be recorded through the software include deaths at hospitals and homes to primarily strengthen the way death statistics are recorded in India.The software, even though it will make registration of deaths easier, does not aim to replace the existing system of death registration. “All deaths must be recorded and certified with cause of death by a medical doctor,” said the a document on the software.The software will help facilitate death registration for families; hospitals that can record a death and maintain death register, and even conduct mortality audits; and it can also help in research and public health by strengthening cause of death statistics; vital event registration, and help in planning and implementation of health care services, among other things.The software can be used by all clinics, nursing homes, hospitals and medical institutes that can register with ICMR-NCDIR. General physicians, who certify death at home, can also participate to make the overall data collection robust.The institute will provide technical assistance to strengthen the quality of cause of death information and strengthen the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD) system in hospitals; facilitate statistical tables for administrative and research needs of hospitals; and generate statistical tables in accordance with MCCD reports of the Registrar General of India reports.Data transmitted through online software is encrypted and securely stored and not shared with any third party.“Not everyone will get access to the data; it will remain for restricted use to protect the identity of the deceased,” Mathur added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-software-in-focus-for-registry-of-deaths/story-vkI73C8ZLNqUTPlMom20KI.html
28-06-2020||India||High alert sounded in south, southwest Delhi for potential locust attack||Delhi’s environment minister Gopal Rai on Saturday issued a high alert in south and southwest districts of the city because of a potential locust attack threat after a small portion of a locust swarm moving towards Palwal in Haryana entered the Asola Bhatti area. The city-state’s agriculture department issued advisories to all district magistrates, sub-divisional magistrates, the forest department and municipal corporations to prepare for locust swarms.After scattered groups of locusts entered Delhi’s border areas including Aya Nagar and Mehrauli, Rai called an emergency meeting at noon on Saturday to discuss the locust threat. The forest department was directed to take measures such as creating high-decibel noise through beating of drums or loud music to scare away the locusts. All district magistrates were asked to remain in touch with the fire department to make arrangements for chemical spraying to save vegetation from the voracious pests.“The DMs have also been asked to deploy adequate staff to make all possible arrangements like Munadi in the villages to guide the residents to distract the locals by making high decibel sound through banging of utensils, beating drums, playing DJs or burning of neem leaves,” the advisory said. Residents of some parts of south Delhi were taken aback when they saw the skyline turning brown around noon.Sanat Swain, a mechanical engineer who was driving to his workplace in Gurugram, saw a large number of locusts near the Indian Institute of Technology flyover. “I was driving and I couldn’t believe what was happening. The sky above me had turned dark brown suddenly,” he said.Northwest India is bracing for more such swarms. Several swarms have flown in from Pakistan and Iran in the past 10 to 15 days after breeding took place there nearly all year round, the Locust Warning Organisation said.The swarm, which had originally started from Pakistan, came via Jhunjhunu in Rajasthan and Rewari in Haryana and reached Gurugram around noon. Before heading towards Palwal, parts of the swarm crossed several stretches of south Delhi. According to the LWO, during locust control operations in Rajasthan, this particular swarm survived the insecticides sprayed on them so they started moving from there and headed towards Gurgaon with the wind direction being predominantly westerly.On Saturday afternoon, the swarm reached Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh and a few scattered groups remained in Delhi. LWO’S seven ground control vehicles were headed towards Bulandshahr where control operations are likely to take place. “These vehicles are mounted with machines that have sprayers. Drones and tractors or fire brigades will also be used. We will spray Malathion 96, Lambda Cyhalothrin and Chlorpyrifos to control the swarm at night in UP,” said KL Gurjar, deputy director, LWO.“We can’t conduct our control operations until they settle down. They could settle in some remote areas around 8 pm,” said JP Singh, joint director, LWO. Spraying of pesticides could take place only after midnight.Meanwhile, with the monsoon approaching the arid regions of Rajasthan, breeding of locusts has started in several pockets, Gurjar said. “Egg laying has taken place and hoppers have emerged. But we will manage to control these hoppers immediately,” Gurjar added.Last week, the Food and Agriculture Organisation had warned that Ethiopia, South Sudan, Pakistan, and India should remain on high alert during the next four weeks for fresh locust invasions. Any swarms in northern Somalia can migrate across the Indian Ocean to the summer breeding areas along both sides of the Indo-Pakistan border.“There are successive breeding cycles in the Horn of Africa. Some swarms from there are moving towards west Africa while some are moving towards Saudi Arabia, Oman and Yemen. These can also come to India in July. Some are expected to directly move to India from the Horn of Africa with the monsoon winds,” Gurjar said.“The winds are moving from the direction of the Horn of Africa towards India. The wind direction is south-westerly during monsoon. I will not be able to comment on whether they will carry these swarms with them,” said M Mohapatra, director general, India Meteorological Department.LWO said the Kharif crop, especially maize and cotton, is likely to be impacted if the two locust threats—from the Indian Ocean and from breeding sites in India -- aren’t controlled||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-alert-sounded-in-south-southwest-delhi/story-7If9O41g5d6zhw3pjunLvO.html
28-06-2020||India||India’s locust control wing is oldest in world||India has the world’s oldest desert locust control programme. The British government established the Locust Warning Organisation (LWO) in 1939 in Karachi following a deadly locust plague between 1926 and 1931.Between 1939 and 1946, the main function of the organization was surveillance in the Thar desert and issuance of warnings to the then Indian states about the possibility of desert locust swarms, their movement and breeding, according to the LWO’s Ready Reckoner. In 1946, the LWO moved to Delhi under the directorate of plant protection, quarantine and storage under the ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare.There were locust outbreaks of different intensities in India in 1812, 1821, 1843-44, 1863-67, 1869-73, 1876-81, 1889-98, 1900-1907, 1912-1920, 1926-1931, 1940-1946, 1949-1955, 1959-1962, 1978, 1993, 1997, 2005, 2010 according to the LWO.Also read | ‘Shut your windows’: Delhi advises people as locusts enter Delhi from GurugramToday, the LWO has 250 employees who survey locust populations and issue bulletins every fortnight that help farmers prepare for a locust invasion. LWO carries out locust surveys or population monitoring activities in line with a survey schedule finalized at the beginning of every locust season, prepares and submits the locust survey reports for the department of agriculture and cooperation; organizes and supervises locust control operations as and whensorequired; coordinates with state governments and the Border Security Force (BSF) for locust control operations, among others.LWO also organises the Indo-Pak locust officers border meeting for exchange of information on locusts, situation in their respective countries during locust season (June to November), the Ready Reckoner says. “Even when there is no locust attack as such, we are surveying and making reports. We also coordinate with the Food and Agriculture Organisation to prepare for possible outbreaks,” said KL Gurjar, deputy director, LWO.Keith Cressman, senior desert locust officer at the FAO, said at a webinar organised by the Centre for Science and Environment last month: “India is well equipped. It has the oldest national locust programme” and so wasbetter prepared to handle the invasions during the current locust upsurge.According to the FAO Commission for Controlling the Desert Locust in South-West Asia publication, the five-year invasion from 1926 to 1931 was estimated to have caused damage to crops alone of Rs 2 crore. Damage was also caused to fodder and pastures, resulting in heavy mortality among cattle, goats and sheep.The report states that South West Asia has experienced several locust plagues in the past. Locusts are mentioned in Sanskrit literature, including the Mahabharata. It also finds mention in the Iranian Zoroastrian Vendidad, the tenth chapter of the Book of Exodus in the Bible and in the Al-Araf chapter 7 of the Quran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-locust-control-wing-is-oldest-in-world/story-gqNQeO3kSCtKAUJKhOOJeO.html
28-06-2020||India||Locust swarms reach NCR, race over to UP||Columns of desert locusts, menacing crop-eating pests, which survived a control operation in Rajasthan on June 26, flew over parts of the national capital region on Saturday, including rural west Delhi (Dwarka), Gurugram and Faridabad, as residents kept their windows shut, banged utensils or played loud music to chase the insects away. Swarms appeared over the skies of Delhi and its satellite cities, Gurugram and Faridabad, on Saturday at mid-morning. The national capital region has likely escaped a major attack because the swarms don’t settle during the day and were racing towards Uttar Pradesh, an official of the agricultural ministry said, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. Locusts fly constantly during daytime and settle down at nightfall.Officials at Delhi’s airport, which falls close to areas over which the locusts flew, were being updated by locust control authorities of the agriculture ministry so that pilots can be briefed, the official cited above said.India is battling an invasions of locusts, which can flatten whole farms overnight, after they appeared earlier than anticipated this year in April in the border areas of Rajasthan. Also read | ‘Shut your windows’: Delhi advises people as locusts enter Delhi from GurugramThe Horn of Africa has been witnessing large breading by locusts since 2019 due to frequent cyclones possibly linked to climate change and swarms have invaded several regions from there, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). The FAO has warned that locust invasions pose a “severe risk” to India’s farm economy this year. In a June 23 update, the FAO said India was among five nations that cannot lower their guard against the locusts for the next four weeks. Desert locusts can fly hundreds of kilometres a daily and a one square-km swarm can eat as much crop food as 35,000 people in terms of weight in a single day, according to the FAO Desert Locust Information Service manual. “As of now, no locust swarms are active in any city. Authorities are tracking their route. The locusts have reached Uttar Pradesh flying over parts of the national capital,” the official cited above said. The swarms may descend somewhere near Agra by nightfall, according to inputs received from tacking teams. On Saturday, expert teams scoured areas which lay under the locust flight path.The country has deployed drones, locally developed sprayers and modified fire tenders to spray malathion, the main pesticide that is effective against the desert locust. India this month shipped 20,000 litres of malathion to Iran to curb breeding there. Controlling the pests in Iran helps India because Iran lies on a west-east corridor the locusts take to enter India through Rajasthan. People living in Gurugram and Faridabad posted pictures and videos showing clouds of pests in their areas. “It was around noon. We heard a humming noise and saw the entire sky covered. The insects must have been several feet up in the air,” said Kuldeep Gurjar, a farmer and the head of Manesar Farmers’ Producer Organisation near Gurugram’s Manesar. “Ground control teams are constantly tracking them and will undertake major control operations once they settle down,” an official statement said. Well-equipped teams in UP are on alert and ready for overnight operations, the official cited above said. Officials are also on alert in Delhi, Rajasthan and Haryana.The locust invasion of the national capital region Saturday was from a large offshoot of pests that survived an elimination operation by agriculture officials in Rajasthan’s Jhunjhunu on the morning of June 26, according to a locust status report. About a third of the pests from that operation is estimated to have survived. These swarms reached Rewari in Haryana on June 26 evening, destroying some crops. Local teams from the locust control organisation, under the farm ministry, undertook control operations there. A group that survived the control operations in Haryana then flew out in three separate formations, each containing millions of locusts. “One of columns headed into Gurugram. It flew in a route that took them over Faridabad and onwards to Uttar Pradesh,” the official said.Another formation flew past rural Dwarka in Delhi towards Daulatabad, Faridabad and Gurugram. “That is why there was a very large presence in Gurugram,” the official cited above said. This swarm too entered UP by afternoon Saturday. A third group headed towards Palwal in Haryana and is also reported to be moving towards UP. If not checked, locust attacks are known to cause considerable drops in food output.The official cited above said all the formations are being tracked by teams of state agriculture departments of Rajasthan, Haryana and UP. More control teams from Rajasthan were being moved to Haryana and UP to launch operations.Locust authorities have ramped up containment since May. The area under control currently stands at about 114,026 hectares, up from about 49,000 hectares in May. One hectare is roughly 2.4 acres.The most threatened states where locust control operations are under way are Rajasthan, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and UP.“India has experience of fighting the pest from two previous outbreaks in 1950 and 1993. We have better technology now. If need be help can be taken of the air force for aerial spraying,” said JN Thakur, a former chief of locust monitoring at the agriculture ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/locust-swarms-reach-ncr-race-over-to-up/story-7wBmpNNgpTIk5VjqIkRGtI.html
28-06-2020||India||Covid-19: New protocols prescribe use of dexamethasone||The Union heath ministry on Saturday revised clinical management protocols for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), and added the steroid dexamethasone for use on patients with progressive deterioration of oxygenation indicators, rapid worsening on imaging and excessive activation of the body’s inflammatory response.“The updated protocol includes the advice to use Dexamethasone as an alternative choice to Methylprednisolone for managing moderate to severe cases of Covid-19. The change has been made after considering the latest available evidence and expert consultation,” the ministry said in a statement.The dosage recommended is 0.2-0.4 mg/kg/day for a period of 3-5 days.Health secretary Preeti Sudan has written to state governments to follow the updated protocol, and to make necessary arrangements for availability and use of the drug in all hospitals.A cheap and widely available steroid drug, dexamethasone can save one in three critically ill Covid-19 patients, according to the results of a scientific scrutiny by the University of Oxford published in a preprint journal on Monday.Also read | Eight states account for 87% of Covid deaths, 85% active cases “Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid drug used in a wide range of conditions for its anti- inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects. The drug has been tested in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the RECOVERY clinical trial and was found to have benefits for critically ill patients and has been shown to reduce mortality by about one third for patients on ventilators, and by about one fifth for patients being maintained on oxygen therapy. It is manufactured in India, costs a few rupees, and has been used for 60 years to treat inflammatory diseases and sceptic shock,” a statement by the health ministry read.Dexamethasone is the first treatment to prevent death from Covid-19. Although antiviral remdesivir has been shown to shorten the time to recovery in hospitalised patients, no therapeutic agents have been shown to reduce mortality.“The drug has shown promise in Covid treatment in the interim results, which is why it has been taken up for use,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi.The drug is also a part of the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM).Also read | Sero survey in Delhi begins to map exposure to coronavirusThe ministry last updated clinical management protocols for Covid-19 on June 13 to include the antiviral drug remdesivir (under emergency use authorisation) and immunosuppressant tocilizumab (off label).Another therapy that received approval for off label use is convalescent plasma therapy in which plasma of recovered individuals is transfused to patients who are not improving.“There is no specific medication for Covid-19 at the moment and world over these medicines are being tried in hospitalized patients currently. However, there are certain contraindications in use of these medicines so the medicine is not for everyone and needs to be started under strict medical supervision,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, critical care department, Medanta Hospital.The World Health Organization (WHO) has also cautioned that dexamethasone must only be used on patients with severe or critical disease, under close clinical supervision, and could cause harm if given too early in the disease stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-protocols-prescribe-use-of-dexamethasone/story-avRSxVRIgRcJD0LwO1uQPP.html
28-06-2020||India||Eight states account for 87% of Covid-19 deaths, 85% active cases||Eight states in India account for 85.5% of the active coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, and also 87% of total deaths caused by the pandemic in the country, the group of ministers (GoM) overseeing the fight against the public health crisis was informed on Saturday.The group, headed by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, held its 17th meeting since February, when it was constituted by the Prime minister Narendra Modi to manage and review the evolving outbreak.The high disease burden states in terms of Covid-19 cases and deaths are Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Telangana, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal.The Centre has rushed 15 teams consisting of public health experts, epidemiologists, clinicians and a senior joint secretary level official to provide technical support to the states.Another team of experts from the Centre, led by joint secretary Lav Agarwal, is currently visiting Gujarat, Maharashtra and Telangana to review the Covid-19 situation and assist the states to plug the gaps in disease containment and treatment.“The main focus of the government is to reduce the number of deaths due to Covid-19. India’s death rate is the lowest globally, but each life counts. Even a single death is too much so efforts are being made to devise measures that will help us save lives,” said a government official, requesting anonymity.Also read | Sero survey in Delhi begins to map exposure to coronavirusThe key focus areas that are being communicated to all states are strict containment measures and surveillance; utilising full testing capacity; focus on monitoring of comorbid and elderly population; predicting emerging hot spots leveraging digital tools such as Aarogya Setu; ensuring seamless patient admission processes; fatality mitigation through effective clinical management; focus on infrastructure preparedness (critical care beds, oxygen, ventilators and logistics); and ensuring that non-Covid health care services are not impacted.The director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Dr Balram Bhargava, gave a detailed presentation to the GoM on the testing strategy of ICMR. There are 1,026 laboratories conducting Covid-19 testing, including 741 in the government sector and 285 private labs. The samples tested in the past 24 hours increased to 220,479, from about 200,000 samples a couple of days earlier, taking the total cumulative number of samples tested to 79,96,707 since January 22, when first sample was tested for Covid-19 in India.Also read | The science behind Delhi’s five-pronged fight against CovidIndia has 1,039 dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, with 1,76,275 isolation beds, 22,940 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 77,268 oxygen supported beds.

28-06-2020||India||BJP, Congress trade fresh barbs||A war of words between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress over the Sino-India border dispute and alleged links between China and the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF), a trust chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, intensified on Saturday with allegations and counter-allegations flying thick and fast on both sides. BJP president JP Nadda asked the principal opposition party a series of questions, reiterated allegations that RGF received donations from the Chinese embassy when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) was in power at the Centre, said his party will leave no stone unturned in “exposing double-faced politicians”, and alleged that fugitive economic offender Mehul Choksi gave donations to the trust.The BJP says both the Chinese government and the Chinese embassy in India have contributed to RGF, and even the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) donated money to the trust when the Congress-led UPA was in power.“I want to tell Sonia Gandhi that under the garb of China and Covid-19 crisis, one should not shy away from answering the questions the nation wants to know... It’s a shame. It’s a sacrifice of national interest by accepting money from foreign powers in personal trusts,” Nadda said in a statement.He alleged that RGF received donations from the Chinese embassy between 2005 and 2009 and from “tax havens” such as Luxembourg between 2006 and 2009. NGOs and companies with “deep commercial interests” also donated to the foundation, he said.“Congress and corruption are synonymous,” Nadda said, asking the opposition party to come clean on its “links” with China and the details of its MoU (memorandum of understanding) with the Communist Party of China. He said India’s trade deficit with China soared to $36.2 billion in 2013-14 from $1.1 billion in 2003-2004, and asked if it was a “quid pro quo”. The Congress-led UPA was in power between 2004 and 2014.Nadda also targeted former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, accusing him of allocating Rs 100 crore to the foundation as the finance minister in 1991, when India was going through its “worst financial crisis”.Singh and Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and P Chidambaram are trustees of RGF, which was set up in June 1991. “RGF not only takes money from scams but also gives dodgy donations to their own organisations. Why did it turn donate money to Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust controlled by the family and Christian Missionary organisations like World Vision?” Nadda asked, referring to the Nehru-Gandhi family.He alleged that RGF worked with the China Association for Internationally Friendly Contact, “which is just a vehicle of the Central Military Commission of China to infiltrate and influence top voices in other countries”. He said the UPA government forced multiple ministries, including the home ministry and the health ministry, and public sector units such as SAIL, SBI, GAIL, and ONGC to donate to RGF. He also wondered how RGF, a private charitable trust, could function from Jawahar Bhawan, a prime location in the heart of Delhi. “Why was a Congress man’s company auditing PMNRF? PMNRF auditor’s name is Thakur, Vaidyanathan and Aiyyar Co, founded by Mr Rameshwar Thakur (who was a Rajya Sabha MP for two terms, former MoS finance, and the governor of four states),” Nadda said. In its reply, the Congress dared the ruling party to ask the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) — the BJP’s ideological mentor — and think-tanks Vivekananda International Foundation and India Foundation —considered pro-BJP — to disclose their source of funding and donors. “Will the BJP disclose the source of funding, amounts received, name of donors [including of Chinese origin] for “Overseas Friends of BJP [OF-BJP]”?” Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala asked. “...What is the connection of Shri Rajkumar Naraindas Sabnani alias Raju Sabnani to OF-BJP?” he added. Sabnani is a businessman based in Hong Kong.Surjewala said neither did RGF receive any donation from Choksi, wanted in the Punjab National Bank fraud case, and nor did it give him any loan to him. But the foundation received “a modest donation of Rs. 10 lakh from Naviraj Estates Pvt. Ltd. in 2013, of which Shri Choksi was one of the Directors”.S Gurumurthy, the chairman of Vivekananda International Foundation (VIF), said on Twitter its trust deed prohibits receipt of foreign donations. “...It permits donations from people of Indian origin associated with VIF. As yet no one has got associated and no donations have been received,” he said.Earlier on Saturday, former Union minister P Chidambaram targeted Nadda in a series of tweets, a day after the BJP chief accused the Congress of committing a “brazen fraud” by diverting public money in PMNRF to a “family-run foundation”.PMNRF was set up in 1948 by India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, entirely with public contributions. It does not get any budgetary support. PMNRF resources are utilised primarily to give relief to families of those killed in natural calamities, and to victims of major accidents and riots, according to its website.Chidambaram said Nadda “specialises in half-truths”, and pointed out that Surjewala “exposed his half-truths”.In his rebuttal on Friday, Surjewala issued a statement saying the BJP and the central government “keep referring to a 2005 grant of Rs 1.45 crores” from the Chinese embassy to RGF for a disabled persons’ welfare programme and research on Sino-India relations. The statement also said after the 2004 tsunami, RGF received Rs 20 lakh from PMNRF for relief activities in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.“What has the grant to RGF 15 years ago got to do with China’s intrusion into Indian territory in 2020 under the watch of the Modi government? “Suppose RGF returns the Rs 20 lakh, will PM Modi assure the country that China will vacate its transgression and restore status quo ante?” Chidambaram asked.The allegations and counter-allegations come against the backdrop of a face-off between India and China along the contested border. Twenty Indian Army soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops died in a brawl in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15, ratcheting up tensions between the neighbours amidst a military build-up on both sides of the disputed border. While the Congress accuses the government of ceding ground to the Chinese, the ruling BJP says the opposition party is playing with issues of national security. The Congress also says the BJP is raking up the RGF donation issue to divert attention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-congress-trade-fresh-barbs/story-n6bY08DnJpxefd6FnMdd9O.html
28-06-2020||India||India deploys air defence systems in eastern Ladakh||As part of its military readiness plan to deter any aggressive move by Chinese forces in eastern Ladakh, India has deployed its air defence weapon systems in the sensitive sector where tensions rose sharply after a brutal brawl in Galwan Valley left 20 Indian troops dead, people familiar with the developments said on Saturday on the condition of anonymity.The June 15 clash left an unconfirmed number of Chinese troops dead.“In this heightened state of readiness, necessary measures have been taken by all services working in an integrated environment to ensure that we are ready for all eventualities,” said one of people cited above.The air defence weapons in the Indian military arsenal include the indigenous Akash, the Israeli SpyDer and Soviet-origin Pechora and OSA-AK systems. Air defence systems can engage targets such as fighter jets, helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles.Both India and China have significantly reinforced their deployments with fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, heavy artillery and missiles in the region that has garnered extensive global attention in recent weeks, particularly after the bloodshed along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Galwan Valley.Also read | India waits for China’s PLA to disengage at Ladakh, says won’t allow a ‘new normal’“We have strengthened our deployments responding to the military buildup on the Chinese side. We are keeping a strict vigil along the LAC and are fully prepared to respond to any threatening action by the PLA,” said the second official cited above. Senior Indian and Chinese military commanders reached a consensus on disengaging from friction points along the LAC on June 22. However, China has not halted — and instead ramped up — its military activity in Galwan Valley, with a concentration of soldiers, military vehicles, earth-moving machinery, and erection of structures, including near the same point where Indian and Chinese troops clashed on June 15.“When the end state of a situation cannot be predicted, military prudence says you should be prepared for the worst,” said Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd), a former Northern Army commander. India has moved thousands of additional troops to the Ladakh sector along with air, artillery and armour support to cater to any eventuality, said a third official.The Indian Air Force and the Indian Army have deployed their air defence systems in eastern Ladakh even as the People’s Liberation Army Air Force has activated several of its bases in both Xinjiang and the Tibet Autonomous Region with Chinese fighter jets regularly making a show of strength in the Aksai Chin area, said the first official cited above.Also read | China, the common link between Ladakh and 3 US super carriers in the Indo-PacificAir defence refers to protecting military assets from an aerial threat by the enemy. India is working on setting up an air defence command to enhance military synergy and optimally utilise the resources of the armed forces.The IAF has raised its guard to deal with any military provocation by the Chinese forces and forward bases have been ordered to be on their highest state of alert, the first official said. Apart from Sukhoi-30s and upgraded MiG-29 fighter jets, the IAF is operating Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters --- both imported from the United States --- in the region.The Indian Army has deployed its new US-origin M777 ultra-light howitzers, which can provide accurate artillery fire support in mountainous terrain, in eastern Ladakh, said the second official cited above. The 155 mm/39-caliber M777 howitzers can be sling-loaded to helicopters and swiftly deployed to high-altitude areas. India ordered 145 howitzers from the United States for $750 million in November 2016. The howitzers have a range of 24-30 km.Disengagement of Indian and Chinese forces from friction areas along LAC is likely to be cumbersome and long-drawn, and it could take weeks, or even months, for the border situation to improve, as reported by Hindustan Times on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-deploys-air-defence-systems-in-eastern-ladakh/story-51A8hRvCzVCHIykilm8ELO.html
28-06-2020||India||Govt using five weapons against Covid-19, says Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||Acknowledging that the spike in Covid-19 cases in Delhi after the lockdown ended had been steeper than he anticipated, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday that his government’s strategy to tackle pandemic has been to increase the number of hospital beds and ensure timely oxygen supply for people infected by the virus, ramp up testing, expand plasma therapy trials and screen every household for symptoms of the disease.At a digital press conference, Kejriwal said the Delhi government was using “five weapons” in the fight against the coronavirus disease in the capital, where he traced the start of the outbreak to the arrival of 35,000 people from other countries in March. The chief minister added that it was a conscious decision by his government not to impose another lockdown in the city because it was not a “long-term solution”.Delhi added 2,948 cases of the disease on Saturday, taking the total to 80,188, of whom 2,558 have died.The first weapon, he said, was increasing the number of Covid-19 beds across the city. Kejriwal said Delhi now has around 13,500 beds available, out of which nearly 7,500 were vacant as of Saturday afternoon. He said Covid deaths increased in Delhi sometime around the first week of June because people were struggling to get a hospital bed in the city.  “But, now there is no such problem. We will continue to augment beds even if they are lying vacant, so that we are prepared for any kind of emergency,” he said.“In the past one month, we scaled up the availability of Covid-19 beds in the city’s hospitals. Our first decision was to reserve at least 40% beds in all major hospitals of Delhi for Covid patients. Second decision was to convert some government and private hospitals into dedicated Covid facilities. Thirdly, we attached several hotels to hospitals. The hotels were against the move and went to court. We won the legal battle and now 3,500 beds are ready in various hotels across Delhi,” Kejriwal said.The chief minister said another 2,000 beds are now available at a temporary Covid facility in South Delhi’s Radha Saomi Satsang Beas Centre. The facility will have over 10,000 beds for Covid-19 patients.In addition to this, the government is also readying 450 beds at its hospital at Burari which has a total capacity of 1,500 beds.The second weapon, Kejriwal said was testing. Compared to first week of June, when around 5,000 Covid tests per day were being conducted in Delhi, testing has increased by four times, government data showed. The chief minister said Delhi is currently doing over 20,000 tests per day, which is the highest in the country.“We aggressively testing people in every nook and corner of the city and the positive or suspected ones are being isolated. I want to thank the Central government for allowing us to do rapid antigen tests and providing the first batch of kits. Now Delhi government has on its own purchased 6 lakh antigen detection kits,” he said.The third weapon, Kejriwal said, was providing pulse oximeters to every Covid patient under home isolation. He also reiterated the government’s decision to provide oxygen concentrators to every district so it can be sent to a patient’s home if his or her health deteriorates. “Our goal is to equip ever Covid bed in the city with an oxygen concentrator. We have procured around 4,000 oxygen concentrators,” he said.The fourth weapon, he said, was plasma therapy. Delhi was the first city in the country to start trials of plasma therapy, using the blood plasma of recovered Covid-19 patiets. It does not help serious patients, but plasma therapy has quickened the recovery of patients with moderate symptoms of the coronavirus disease, Kejriwal said. On Friday, the chief minister had said that the therapy helped reduce the death rate by more than 50% in Lok Nayak Hospital.Eight hospitals in Delhi are conducting plasma therapy trials. They include Lok Nayak, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital, which come under the Central government, and five prominent private hospitals.Lastly, Kejriwal said his government was relying on surveys and screening to curb the pandemic. “We will take it (the survey) to every home in Delhi to check the extent to which this virus has spread. It will help us decide our future course of action,” he said.Three major tasks are currently underway in Delhi which include a house-to-house survey to identify people with symptoms, a serological survey which started on Saturday and redrawing of the perimeters of the containment zones in the city. All three exercises are currently underway simultaneously.“Increasing the bed strength and testing or providing pulse oximeters are important steps, but the focus is still on infrastructure and purchase. What about the human resource? If the government wants the PGs to work, they have to be given some incentive. Otherwise why would a student say from Tamil Nadu want to come to Delhi just to work in a Covid-19 area?” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-using-five-weapons-against-covid-19-kejriwal/story-GtFWJ0MhpBkIndaN8oyZkJ.html
28-06-2020||India||The science behind Delhi’s five-pronged fight against Covid-19||Declaring a war on the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), armed with hospital beds, testing kits, pulse oximeters, oxygen concentrators, and surveyors with pens and notebooks, may sound laughable on the face of it, but in the absence of a vaccine or cure, these are the most effective tools to save lives and stop the spread of a pandemic that has infected 529,485 and killed 16,101 in India.Fortunately for us, these work when used in combination with self-protection measures, such as frequent handwashing, wearing a mask, and social distancing of at least two metres in public places.Here’s why these five weapons are part of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s arsenal.BedsAround 22% of Covid-19 deaths in Delhi occur within 24 hours of hospital admission, and another 40% within 48 hours of admission, which indicates that people are seeking treatment in severe or critical disease stages, when treatment options are limited. The Union health ministry on Saturday asked the Delhi government to analyse data for all Covid-19 deaths to find out why people were reaching hospitals too late for treatment, which was happening for many reasons, including delays in admission because of bed shortages, fear of infection, and poor disease assessment, among others. To ensure everyone who needs treatment get it, Delhi now has 13,335 Covid beds, and plans to add another 1,000 next week in a field hospital in Dhaula Kuan run by army doctors and paramedics.Patients with moderate disease can be treated with a battery of newly approved treatments, including the antivirals remdesivir and favipiravir, the steroids dexamethasone and glucocorticoids, and convalescent plasma therapy, which is an experimental therapy available at some hospitals.Testing kitsDelhi has ramped up testing from around 5,000 tests two weeks ago to over 21,000 tests a day, with the state government adding rapid antigen testing to conventional reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) tests for quicker results. It has placed orders for 600,000 rapid antigen tests to top up the 50,000 kits it had acquired from the Centre.Also read | Delhi’s Covid-19 count soars past 80,000-mark with 2,948 fresh cases“Testing and isolation stops disease transmission and protects those around us from infection. Asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic people and those with mild disease can also infect and sicken others, which can only be prevented by widening testing so that people are aware of their positive status and take measures to stop infecting others,” said Dr Dileep Mavalankar, director, Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar.Pulse oximeters and oxygen concentratorsA key clinical sign of Covid-19 is extremely low blood oxygen level, which can lead to hypoxia or death from oxygen starvation. The healthy range of SpO2 (peripheral oxygen saturation) is between 95% and 100%, but in people with Covid-19, it may fall below 90% without inducing symptoms of breathless, chest discomfort, lethargy or confusion. This condition, called “silent” hypoxia, results in people not realising they are oxygen-starved till their lungs collapse.Doctors recommend that the moment symptoms begin, oxygen levels must be checked frequently with a pulse oximeter, which is a small device that measures SpO2 at the finger tip. Low oxygen levels are a red flag for hospitalisation, where oxygen support can help save lives. “Higher SpO2 levels after oxygen supplementation were associated with reduced Covid-19 mortality independently of age and sex,” according to study published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings in June.“Pulse oximeter is working as a security cover for Covid-19 patients. It helps them check oxygen levels at frequent levels and alert us if there’s anything serious…,” Kejriwal said on Saturday.Convalescent plasma therapy“Plasma therapy is being used by many now. This doesn’t work for patients who are on ventilators or who have multi-organ failure but helps those with moderate symptoms,” said Kejriwal. The chief minister is partly right. Plasma therapy is recommended for patients with moderate disease but its effectiveness is still under review, which makes this experimental therapy “hopeful but unproven” at best.Also read | Govt using five weapons against Covid-19, says Delhi CM Arvind KejriwalPlasma from the blood of a recovered patient, which carries specific antibodies that can neutralise the new coronavirus, are transfused into a sick Covid-19 patient to reinforce the immune system. Convalescent plasma has been used to prevent and treat infections since the 1890s, and immunoglobulin IgE serum is still injected in people with animal bites to prevent rabies, and varicella-zoster immunoglobulin is given to pregnant women who have been exposed to chickenpox, to prevent pregnancy complications. The therapy has no serious adverse reactions, but scientists say there is need for larger randomised-controlled clinical trials to establish efficacy.Surveys and screeningIdentifying undiagnosed infection in people who may have missed getting tested because they were asymptomatic, had mild symptoms, or testing wasn’t accessible, helps to calculate the real number of people affected. “People with mild illness go out and spread infection, so even asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic close contacts of a positive case must quarantine themselves even if you don’t feel ill. If you don’t, you become part of the chain and transmission doesn’t stop,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-science-behind-delhi-s-five-pronged-fight-against-covid/story-CNo9uNt7FtVktaYvWYQDPO.html
