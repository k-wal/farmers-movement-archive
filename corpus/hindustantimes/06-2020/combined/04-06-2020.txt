04-06-2020||Mumbai||Koshyari gives nod for undergraduate and postgraduate medical exams from July 15||Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, in his capacity as the chancellor of all universities on Thursday, approved the state government’s plan to conduct all undergraduate and postgraduate examinations of the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) from July 15.State minister of medical education Amit Deshmukh had met the Governor at Raj Bhavan on Thursday morning to submit the plan. Koshyari, while conveying his approval, also appreciated the detailed plan presented by the minister.This comes days after the Governor snubbed the state government and chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray for taking the decision to cancel the final-year university examinations and give students aggregate marks based on the previous semesters, without consulting himDeshmukh, in his letter to the Governor, said that MUHS had decided to conduct examinations as per three alternate plans, depending on the situation, from July 15.“According to the first plan, the theory examinations will be held from July 15 to August 15 in a staggered manner, if the situation is conducive. As per the second plan, if the examinations cannot be held as per the first plan due to Covid-19, the same will be held between August 16 and September 15,’’ stated the communication from Raj Bhavan.The third plan is to seek guidance from the Central Medical Council on conducting examinations if both plans cannot be implemented.Deshmukh is learnt to have informed the Governor that he had held discussions with all stakeholders, regulatory authorities besides consulting former vice-chancellors and pro vice-chancellors.The medical education minister has held consultations with Indian Nursing Council, Medical Council of India and other central bodies before deciding the examination schedule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/koshyari-gives-nod-for-undergraduate-and-postgraduate-medical-exams-from-july-15/story-O883r3epWYeZa97q29OAYL.html
04-06-2020||Chandigarh||State nodal officer among 327 test positive in Haryana||Haryana’s nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Dhruva Chaudhary, 56, and his 25-year-old daughter are among the 327 people who tested positive for the virus in the state on Thursday. “We had collected the samples of Dr Chaudhary’s 50-year-old wife on June 2, while the samples of the nodal officer and his daughter, who is also a doctor in a private hospital, were taken on Wednesday. Dr Chaudhary and his daughter tested positive on Thursday, while the result of his wife is awaited,” a senior official in the PGIMS microbiology department said. Dr VK Katyal, senior professor of medicine at PGIMS, has been appointed as state nodal officer for Covid-19 in the absence of Dr Chaudhary, said PGIMS vice-chancellor OP Kalra. “41 contacts of Dr Chaudhary, including PGIMS staff, have been quarantined,” he added. STATE’S TALLY NOW 3,281Haryana on Thursday again saw the biggest single-day spike in infections, which took the state’s tally to 3,281. Even as the Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Centre to convene a meeting with Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh to find out a common programme and a common portal for interstate movement within a week, the spiraling number of fresh cases in Gurugram continued to be a cause of concern for the state health authorities. Gurugram and Faridabad accounted for about 77% of the positive cases recorded on Thursday. While Gurugram registered 215 fresh cases, 35 infections were detected in Faridabad. Other NCR districts recording fresh cases were Palwal (7), Nuh (4) and Jhajjar (2).‘INTERSTATE MOVEMENT LEADING TO RISE IN CASES’Deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala on Thursday said Covid cases were on rise in Sonepat, Gurugram, Jhajjar and Faridabad due to interstate movement between these districts and the national capital. He said all three states (Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh) must appoint one senior official to set up a common programme for ensuring better interstate movement. The deputy CM said interstate borders must be opened for limited people and work from home should be encouraged. 49-YEAR-OLD MAN DIES IN KARNALA 49-year-old man has reportedly died due to coronavirus in Karnal. He was among the five persons who had tested positive for the virus on Thursday, said Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Yadav. These cases are yet to be added to the state’s official tally. While three new cases were reported in Kaithal, nine people were found infected in Kurukshetra and one each in Panipat and Ambala. Sukhbir Singh, chief medical officer, Kurukshetra, said all local patients either have a history of travel or being in contact with a corona carrier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/state-nodal-officer-among-327-test-positive-in-haryana/story-sytKrOY2oFzQBD1jh8PAlL.html
04-06-2020||Mumbai||‘Mini war rooms’ in wards to allot beds to Covid-19 patients: Chahal||As the struggle to find beds for Covid-19 patients continues, to bring down the turnaround time, civic chief Iqbal Singh Chahal has decentralised the allotment of beds to Covid-19 patients. Chahal has directed all 24 ward offices to develop 24 mini war rooms, each with a dedicated staff of 10 officers, including medical staff. These mini war rooms are expected to be operational from Monday.From Monday, all those who call on 1916 will be redirected to the mini war rooms which will allot beds in their respective wards. Each ward’s mini war room will also have its own phone line, numbers for which are yet to be released. According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the mini war rooms will allot beds and ventilators to patients in intensive care units (ICUs), as well as normal beds in Covid care centres and beds in quarantine facilities for high-risk contacts.Additional municipal commissioner, Suresh Kakani said, “The whole idea of a mini war room to allot beds to citizens is to bring down the turnaround time. There have been complaints that it gets very late while allotting beds, and we are taking steps towards minimising the hardship. The ward-level war room can allot all types of beds, including ICU beds, oxygen beds and even ventilators depending on availability.”BMC had earlier developed a centralised dashboard that could be accessed by civic officials who could guide citizens calling on disaster management helpline (1916). The dashboard is updated every 30 minutes. However, citizens say finding beds continues to be difficult.As per the new plan, every ward’s mini war room will have live data from the centralised dashboard. Based on this, the ward office will allocate beds to citizens. A BMC official said, “Earlier, ward offices were coordinating with the central team as they were allotting the beds. However, now the filter of central team will not be there.”Not being able to find beds for Covid-19 patients has been a consistent problem. Andheri-resident Amruta Das, who lost her uncle to Covid-19, said, “My uncle tested positive on May 29 and he had difficulty breathing due to which he was put on oxygen, owing to which he required ventilator. However, for over 24 hours we had to wait for the ventilator to be allocated. My uncle was taken to three hospitals where we were told ventilators were available, but on reaching, we were informed they weren’t available. My uncle passed away on the evening of May 30 at Shatabdi Hospital in Govandi due to not getting the required treatment.”Ujwal Shah, a resident of Malad, said, “Our neighbour was tested positive on May 28 and was hospitalised the same day at a private hospital. However, his condition deteriorated on May 29 after which we were told that he needs a bed in ICU. But all beds in the particular hospital were full and we were asked to shift the patient immediately. However, for almost 24 hours, we couldnot find a bed for the patient. The doctors put him on oxygen in the general ward itself, but his life could not be saved. We understand that the number of patients are too much to handle, but we cannot have citizens left to die.”As of May 28, BMC has over 82,000 beds for Covid-19 patients. This number includes beds for quarantined high-risk contacts of Covid-positive people. Around 70,000 of the 82,000 beds are for asymptomatic positive patients, mild cases and positive cases. Of the remainder, 373 are beds with ventilators and 645 are ICU beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mini-war-rooms-in-wards-to-allot-beds-to-covid-19-patients-chahal/story-2AyEuNwBkA2zVJi6owUrSJ.html
04-06-2020||Chandigarh||Govt to empanel pvt hospitals for taking samples of covid-19 suspects||The Punjab health and family welfare department has decided to involve private hospitals in testing for covid-19 and will empanel these to take samples. These hospitals will only take samples, charging not more than Rs 1,000 for the service, with government facilities to carry out the actual test.Civil surgeons will carry empanel these hospitals at the district level with only those having a flu ward eligible to apply. State health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said private hospitals would need to arrange all logistics for the purpose, including kits. “Government facilities will test these samples free of cost. It has been made mandatory that private hospital/clinics and labs should have a separate isolated area for suspected patients of covid-l9, where the sample will be taken. The person taking the sample should be in full protective gear,” reads the letter that director, health and family welfare, has sent to all civil surgeons.The private hospital will pack the sample in an ice-box and send it to the nearest government testing facility as per protocol. The hospitals would ensure filling all testing data, as per the protocol of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on the RT-PCR App, as RT-PCR is the name of the technique used in the test.WHO CAN GIVE SAMPLES?Sidhu added symptomatic international or domestic travellers, symptomatic contacts of confirmed covid-19 patient, symptomatic persons coming from containment zones/hot-spots, asymptomatic high-risk contacts of COVID-19 patient, asymptomatic/symptomatic front-line workers and symptomatic returnees or migrants.ILL-PLANNED MOVE: PRIVATE HOSPITALS Private hospitals are jittery over this move with the Indian Medical Association (IMA) terming it as ‘ill-planned’. “The government which was earlier not ready to involve private hospitals in its planning seems to have exhausted itself in carrying out testing. Now, officials want us to take samples without providing any training to our staff. We don’t have any problem in serving the state, but the government should make efforts to train our staff to take samples,” said Dr Navjot Dahiya, IMA Punjab president. He added that the decision was taken without taking them into confidence, with little planning done on managing covid-related biomedical waste. “Private hospitals had been dithering on carrying out covid-19 testing, because of risk of infection to its staff. At least, now these hospitals don’t have any excuse as they can earn from this,” said a senior health department functionary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/govt-to-empanel-pvt-hospitals-for-taking-samples-of-covid-19-suspects/story-MJzVun9QWT27Ck7SBbx9NI.html

04-06-2020||Delhi||IIT flyover robbery: Cops chased suspects for 8km, 10 tems formed to crack case||A gang of motorcycle-borne robbers, who allegedly stabbed and robbed a Spicejet pilot on the IIT flyover in the early hours of Wednesday, were chased by a police team for nearly eight kilometers before they managed to slip away, the Delhi Police said.The police have now formed 10 teams, comprising a total of around 100 personnel, to crack the case, Devender Arya, deputy commissioner of police (south-west) said.“We are checking CCTV footage of that entire eight-kilometre stretch. The registration numbers of the motorcycles and scooters would have certainly been captured by one of those cameras. It is just a matter of time before we crack the case,” said Arya.The Spicejet pilot was targeted by the gang when he was travelling from his home in Faridabad towards Delhi’sIndira Gandhi International Airport. The man was allegedly intercepted by the gang on the IIT-Delhi flyover around 1.30 am on Wednesday.While the pilot has told the police that there were atleast eight to 10 suspects, investigators believe that there were four or five men riding three motorcycles and scooters.According to the pilot’s complaint, the robbers intercepted the cab, smashed its windows and pointed a gun at his forehead.“One of them robbed Rs10,000 cash from him while another stabbed him in his thigh,” the DCP said. The injury sustained by the pilot is not life threatening, the officer added.The driver was allegedly let off with after being slapped once.Later, even as the pilot made a call to the police control room (PCR), an emergency response vehicle (ERV) of the police patrolling the road below the flyover was alerted by a passerby about the incident, the DCP said.“The police team took a U-turn and reached the flyover to find four-five men riding away on three motorcycles. The victim pointed at the suspects and told the police team that they had robbed him,” the officer said.The police immediately launched a chase and pursued the suspects along Aurobindo Marg till Mehrauli, a distance of almost eight kilometers, the DCP said.“In Mehrauli, the suspects took a sudden turn and disappeared into the bylanes. We lost them there,” said the DCP.But the police have charted out the route of the chase and are checking CCTV footages along the route, the officer said. No clues about the suspects had emerged till Thursday evening, the officer added.HT tried to reach the pilot for his version , but he did not respond to calls and messages. Spicejet too refused to comment on the matter.The police believe that the gang of bikers comprised history sheeters. “We have activated our sources and are checking the roles of criminals with such a modus operandi,” the DCP said.Another investigator, who didn’t want to be identified, said that while robbery remains the prime crime, the police are also simultaneously probing if there was a road rage angle involved in the crime.“There were so many robbers, yet they did not take the victim’s watch or mobile phones. We are probing if it was a case of road rage that turned into robbery,” the investigator said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/iit-flyover-robbery-cops-chased-suspects-for-8km-10-tems-formed-to-crack-case/story-q1xbVX9ctThftu0ntLcsZP.html

Such people can enter Delhi from other states by applying and obtaining an e-pass. Advocate Sanjoy Ghose, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, and advocate Urvi Mohan, told a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan that its Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has issued an order on June 1 with regard to prohibited and permitted activities, during the phased reopeningof the capital. The guidelines, the lawyers said, permit entry into Delhi from neighbouring states in case of medical emergencies.The court was hearing a plea by an advocate Kushagra Kumar seeking immediate de-sealing of Delhi borders to enable citizens in NCR or other states to access Central government hospitals and medical facilities in the national capital.Taking note of the submission and the DDMA order of June 1, the bench disposed of the plea while also directing the Delhi government to upload the June 1 order on its various department websites by today in a prominent manner and have it highlighted for easy access by citizens.The plea had said those working in Delhi and residing in NCR cities — like Noida and Gurugram — or other states are deprived of their right of accessing Central government’s medical facilities,like AIIMS, in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/people-with-medical-emergencies-can-cross-border-delhi-govt-tells-hc/story-USbwqbeTOorTqj7yeZyiuN.html

Sources in the secretariat said that the Jammu and Kashmir administration was likely to come out with an order to shift Darbar Move offices to Srinagar in the next two days.Jammu-based employees, who were the first to learn about such a plan of the government, held a demonstration on the premises of the Civil Secretariat against any such decision and demanded to immediately defer the decision till Covid-19 situation improved in the Union territory.Employees assembled outside the civil secretariat and held a strong protest demonstration.The Civil Secretariat at Srinagar started partial functioning on May 4 with the staff and officers on ‘as is where is’ basis i.e. those who have already been or likely to get relocated before that date.The administrative secretaries and heads of departments have been asked to assign work to officers, staff stationed at Srinagar and Jammu accordingly for obtaining maximum efficiency and minimum disruption.An earlier order had stated that the above issue shall be reviewed on June 15 when a clear picture on the extent and spread of Covid-19 would have been at hand.“It will be disastrous if authorities shift the Civil Secretariat to Srinagar at this stage of the pandemic when it has started to explode. A senior IAS officer who had gone to Srinagar had returned Covid-19 positive and has put entire top bureaucracy into jeopardy. How the government could even think something so silly,” an employee said.It may be stated here that on May 5, Jammu and Kashmir high court had asked the Centre and UT administration to look into the veracity of 148-year-old biannual Darbar Move practice that costs more than ₹200 crore to the cash-strapped and economically weak Union territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/civil-secretariat-staffers-protest-against-admn-s-decision-to-shift-darbar-move-offices-to-srinagar/story-hmBBQMCT5AQvxP7JKjIPQJ.html
04-06-2020||Chandigarh||Hisar gram growers accuse arhtiyas of duping them||Hundreds of farmers on Thursday protested against two commission agents for allegedly cheating them by manipulating an electronic weighing machine in Hisar mandi.Dalip Singh, a farmer from Dobhi village said, “A commission agent started weighing the yield on his electronic machine, it showed that per kg gram weight was reduced to five kgs. When a farmer from Khariya village suspected that the weighing machine is showing less weight than the actual, he raised the alarm and soon the farmers gathered. When the bags were weighed on another machine, it was found to be 55.6kg per bag instead of 50.6 kg (as shown on agent’s weighing machine). We want that the government should ensure proper procurement of gram,” Singh added.The Haryana government is procuring grams at ₹4,875 at minimum support price (MSP) per quintal.Ram Kumar, a commission agent alleged that only two commission agents were allotted in Hisar mandi for gram procurement with an aim to dupe farmers.“Both the agents have been demanding ₹400 per quintal from farmers on the name of poor variety of yield while procuring their crop. Both of them had duped many farmers by manipulating an electronic weighing machine which was fixed to show less weight than the actual. We (commission agents) have decided to boycott these agents, who had cheated farmers,” he added.The commission agents, who were facing allegations of duping farmers’ refused to comment on the matter.Market committee chairman Mahavir Jangra said that the farmers were cheated by the commission agents with the consent of HAFED officials.“The government must order an inquiry about the involvement of HAFED officials not in gram but in mustard and wheat procurement also. A gang of commission agents and HAFED officials is working in the mandi to dupe innocent farmers,” Jangra added.Admitting that the farmers were being fleeced, Sultan Singh, Hisar market committee secretary said that they had issued a show-cause notice to two commission agents seeking their explanation on the matter.Hisar deputy commissioner Priyanka Soni said that she has ordered an SDM probe into the matter and strict action will be taken against those who cheated farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hisar-gram-growers-accuse-arhtiyas-of-duping-them/story-SxxLQcFZFSpkMyYbzZKEvL.html
04-06-2020||City||When work fizzled out, an auto driver stepped up to help migrants||Gurugram: As migrant workers arrived in buses at the railway station on Wednesday afternoon to board an evening Shramik Special train, an autorickshaw driver parked his vehicle and hastily took his place at the entrance of the station. He started handing out tickets to migrants and requested them to form a queue.“Please maintain social distancing and take your tickets from here. Do not form a group. Wear a mask and use the sanitiser please,” he yelled to the workers.Over the next three hours, Gurpreet Singh, an autorickshaw driver, distributed food packets, water and dry rations to migrant workers as they lined up at the platforms to board the train to their home states. For the past 25 days, Singh has been helping workers, often carrying cooked meals in his autorickshaw and ferrying migrants to the station, before lending a hand in the screening process, along with members of civil defence teams.Singh, a resident of New Palam Vihar, said that when the lockdown was imposed, he started volunteering to distribute dry rations and cooked food provided by civic authorities and NGOs, to workers at a community centre near his house. “I was moved when I saw pictures of migrants walking to their villages. A friend told me that I could assist the civil defence staff at the railway station and help distribute meals at the railway station. On the days the Shramik Special train is ferrying passengers, I volunteer from 3pm to 6.30pm,” he said.The 46-year-old shifted to Gurugram from Delhi more than a decade ago, and has been driving an autorickshaw since 2011. Since there was no work once the nationwide lockdown came into effect, he decided that rather than being idle, he would devote his time to serve others.“I have been volunteering at gurudwaras for several years. There are people who have been driven out of their homes and are struggling to make ends meet during the pandemic. I am just trying to do my bit by ferrying migrants in my rickshaw or distributing food packets and water. In these tough times, these acts of selfless service can go a long way,” he said.He has a family of seven — his parents, wife, a 17-year-old son, a sister and brother-in-law. “My brother-in-law works as a cleaner. He and I are the only earning members in the family. Since the lockdown, with almost no income, there has been a financial crunch. But we are managing from our savings and a little borrowing from relatives,” he said.He has now resumed driving his autorickshaw, but for only a few hours each day. “I bought the autorickshaw on a loan and still have a few instalments pending. In the morning, I earn a little from ferrying passengers. However from 3pm to 7pm, I dedicate my time to volunteer, either at the railway station or at a community centre,” he said.Sunil Saini, a volunteer from the civil defence team, said, “For the past three weeks, I have seen this autorickshaw driver help migrant workers by distributing meals and helping with their luggage at the railway station. The train usually leaves around 6pm. He comes in his uniform around 3pm and till the train departs, he assists everyone and keeps morale high.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/when-work-fizzled-out-an-auto-driver-stepped-up-to-help-migrants/story-CLaph2Ex3xQVuAUgS96AhM.html

04-06-2020||City||Delhi govt releases funds to 12 DU colleges||New Delhi: While the Delhi government released funds for the 12 fully government-funded Delhi university colleges on Wednesday, colleges said their problems were far from over as the funds were inadequate. Delhi University Teachers’ Association on Thursday also wrote to education minister Manish Sisodia over the matter.Delhi government’s Directorate of Higher Education on Wednesday released Rs 18.75 crore to the 12 colleges as the grant-in-aid for these colleges.“We have received 20% fewer funds this time for the salary of teaching, non-teaching and outsourced staff like guards, peon and housekeeping staff,” said the principal of one such college, requesting anonymity. The principal added that seven DU colleges had not paid salaries of their staff in April and May. “Some colleges ended up using student funds for salaries. There is no fund for electricity bills or maintenance of any kind. If this pattern continues, college fees might be hiked in an arbitrary manner just for maintenance.”DUTA president Rajib Ray wrote a letter to Sisodia on Thursday citing the deficits in each of the 12 colleges. “The grants, sanctioned till date, are much less than the money required to cover salaries up to May. The grants sanctioned on March 25 were barely enough to cover salaries of January and February. Similarly, Grant-in-Aid released on May 7 could not cover salaries up to April,” he wrote, adding that the June sanction was also inadequate. Despite text messages to Sisodia and his office, the government did not comment on the matter.For colleges like Deen Dayal Upadhyay College, Dr BR Ambedkar College, and Keshav Mahavidyalaya, the deficits are above Rs 2 crore, as per the letter. “The 12 colleges are in dire need of the additional funds necessary for infrastructure development for smooth academic and administrative functioning. The colleges still await the release of funds for additional posts for teaching and non-teaching staff in view of the extension of reservation to EWSs and consequent increase in intake of students,” DUTA said in its letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-releases-funds-to-12-du-colleges/story-wIx7j1KRz9U5V3CJYB51EP.html
04-06-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19 cases doubling every four days in Gurugram||As the city continues to register a record spike in the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, data shows that new cases are doubling after every four days. For the first time in the last three months, cases are multiplying at such a fast rate, highlighting the speed at which the virus is being transmitted in the community. Previously, in the first week of May, the highest doubling rate of seven days was reported. Doubling rate is a parameter to estimate the number of days that will be taken for the total number of cases to double. If cases are multiplying within a fewer number of days, then there is an increase in the doubling rate.A state health department official, privy to the matter, admitted that cases are growing in Gurugram, leading to an increased doubling rate. However, he refused to comment on the issue further. Lalit Kant, scientist and former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said, “The doubling rate should not be in a single digit. It indicates the infection is spreading at a faster rate than before. Therefore, testing needs to be increased and quarantining facilities need to be expanded. Special focus should be placed on protecting the elderly and those with co-morbid conditions as more and more asymptomatic people are out on the streets.”In April, the doubling rate was 18 days, when the tally was at 60. It further slowed down to 36 days in the last week of April. But with state government’s testing strategy focusing on high-risk population groups, such as vegetable sellers or workers in the wholesale markets, cases rapidly increased in the city, bring down the doubling rate to 7.2 days. Data shows there was a slight improvement in the doubling rate from May 15 till May 29. During these weeks, cases were multiplying after every 17 and 13 days. With over 675 cases reported between May 29 and June 3, the doubling rate has now come down to four days.Calculating the doubling rate is a dynamic process, where the average of cases reported in the last seven days are being taken. It can be calculated every day, but also every three days and five days. But as per the ICMR guidelines, the Haryana health department has been using a mathematical calculation called Cumulative Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) to decipher the doubling rate.Rajib Dasgupta, professor, community health, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), said, that the doubling time cannot be read directly by comparing cumulative cases. “It needs to be computed on the basis of 4-6 days of moving average, using a logarithmic scale. The doubling time is the length of time required to double the number of confirmed cases, assuming nothing else changes. Changes can include a substantial increase in the testing (particularly in high-risk groups) or re-categorisation across districts or states (as in the National Capital Region).” A district health official, who preferred anonymity, said that more people are getting tested, therefore, there has been a surge in the number of asymptomatic cases. “Nearly 80% of cases do not have any signs or symptoms. The number of cases will continue to rise in June and July until we reach a peak,” said the health official. In the last one week, the surge has also been due to the poor reporting of cases by private laboratories, health department officials said. According to Dasgupta, such a data should be recategorised either by weeks when the sample was collected and tested or can be put under a separate pool of cases. Instead of merging with the fresh cases reported in a particular district. According to the state health department, labs in Delhi, which are taking Covid-19 samples of Haryana residents, are not sharing reports properly with the authorities concerned, resulting in a delay in contact tracing and surveillance activities, besides creating a mismatch between the information provided on the website of ICMR and that on the state portal. They have issued notices to 18 private labs of Delhi, approved by the ICMR for doing Covid-19 testing in the national Capital, for taking the samples of Haryana patients without keeping the Haryana health department in the loop. This has led to Covid-19 data inaccuracies in Haryana, especially in Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-19-cases-doubling-every-four-days-in-gurugram/story-IWy5AgJQ8O6VzpWyRSjIaJ.html
04-06-2020||Gurugram||Haryana government proposes to set up an electronics hub in Sohna||The Haryana government has proposed to set up an electronics manufacturing cluster over a 400-acre plot at its industrial township in Sohna. The Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) has formulated a proposal in this regard and sent an application to the Union ministry of electronics and information technology for approval, said Anurag Agarwal, managing director(MD), HSIIDCThe proposed electronic cluster will have two large anchor units with major investments and will be spread over 100 acres each. “These anchor units will support the vendors. We are looking to manufacture semi-conductor chips, electronic components and other products, which are presently imported from China and other countries,” said Agarwal, adding that these steps are being taken to be self-reliant in the field of electronics and allied products.Officials of HSIIDC said that the Sohna electronic cluster is inspired by the past experience of developing this industrial area into an automotive hub based on the strength of large auto companies, such as Maruti and Hero MotoCorp and Honda. The objective here is to develop a similar electronic manufacturing hub, in which anchor companies act as a magnet for vendors down the supply chain, said officials.To make this project successful, Agarwal said that discussions are on with two major companies from Japan and China, which are likely to set up plants here. “We have also started marketing the electronic cluster and three webinars every week are being organised since May 20 to invite electronics manufacturers to this region,” he said.There are ample opportunities of big-ticket investments in Haryana in the field of electronic components and medical equipment. India wants to become more self-reliant in the medical field so that any disaster can be dealt with easily in the future, said Agarwal.The MD of HSIIDC further said that state chief minister Manohar Lal Lal Khattar has recently invited investors from United States and Japan through video conferencing to set up their industrial units in Haryana. As per the directions of the chief minister, the officers of HSIIDC are interacting one-to-one with the companies, which are willing to invest in Haryana in order to understand their requirements and attract them for investment.To push manufacturing and incentivise production, the Haryana government has also formulated a new policy, whereby a company, which would like to take a land on lease in Haryana to test or use its product, will be given land on lease initially for ten years. The lease would then be renewed after every ten years for a maximum period of 99 years, Agarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-government-proposes-to-set-up-an-electronics-hub-in-sohna/story-48ZxuDADRPv4fCVSDwen9M.html

They said that no staff has been available during the lockdown and that there has been no sanitisation of the premises despite two residents having tested positive for Covid-19.They raised slogans and demanded that the developer return money collected from them.Residents, including women, senior citizens and officials of multinational companies, who took part in the demonstration said the condominium lacks adequate maintenance and power infrastructure, despite the flats being handed to buyers three years ago and them having paid all charges, including for electrification.They said they have filed a complaint with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority online on Wednesday.Namit Jaiswal, a resident at the protest, said that they are facing difficulties managing services, such as cleaning, gardening and plumbing. “There are two positive cases in the condominium and we have to ensure the area is clean and hygienic, but there is no one to even clean the common area and we are dividing duties among ourselves,” he said.Residents alleged that the developer has not paid the property management firm, due to which there are hardly any security guards and essential workers, such as plumbers, electricians and housekeeping staff, have left the place.“There are frequent power cuts and voltage fluctuations. The society runs on diesel gensets and is yet to have proper electricity connections of 33 KVA. Presently, we have 11 KVA, which is not enough for 500 families. During the power cut, lifts stop working. We have elderly people living on the 30th and 40th floors. How will they climb so many stairs?” said Brigadier (retd) Suresh Kumar Sareen.A spokesperson for Ireo said, “We will address all grievances of residents on Friday at 11am at our office. We will take care of the issues in due course of time.”Residents also submitted a complaint to the police, stating that they have already held meetings with the developer and their maintenance team to get 33 KV connections from the state power distribution company, but so far, there has been no response. “The project was supposed to have DHBVN connections within six months from the date of first possession, but even after three years, they are using a temporary connection,” read the complaint submitted to the police.Residents alleged that they are paying over ₹12 per unit of electricity, instead of the ₹6.68, as per the conditions of the occupancy certificate (OC). “As per the OC, 33 KVA station with 12 MW load was to be given to the complex instead builder has taken 5MW temporary connection where electricity charges are ₹12 and plus per unit. We are paying ₹6.68 through the prepaid meter, while the balance of ₹5.50 per unit is to be paid by the developer. However, the entire bill amount of DHBVN, including the builder’s share, is being paid by the RWA,” said Koustav M Dhar, another resident.Aman Yadav, the assistant commissioner of police (Sadar), said that they have received a complaint from the residents and are probing the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/victor-valley-residents-stage-sit-in-at-developer-s-office-after-being-left-without-support-staff-since-lockdown/story-Cju3eoB2V5WX55ZsZ9dHuM.html

Arora, who met owners of industries at the Circuit House on Thursday, also added that migrant workers wanted to return back to Punjab.He added that with the increasing number of industrial units resuming operations in the state, the state government had written to the Union government to arrange trains for bringing back migrant workers who wished to return to work in Punjab. “Two buses with returning workers reached Hoshiarpur on Thursday,” he added. Arora added that he had also written to the Centre to allow export of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits being made in the state.

He added that under the Ghar Ghar Rozgar Scheme, around 20,000 local youngsters were being trained as boiler operators and their two-year course at Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) would end this year.At the meeting, social distancing norms went for a toss as media personnel and industry owners jostled with each other to talk to the minister.

Lakhjeet Singh was brought to the hospital on Thursday morning with fever, according to his family.“He had fever since May 26. After three days of taking medicines, we went to (a private) hospital, where they did an X-ray and said there was chest infection. They took sample for Covid-19 and said that the reports will be available online. We got the test report on June 1 and tried to contact the hospital,” said a message from his son-in-law Mandeep Singh.The family claimed that it went to several private and government hospitals to understand what to do next. They were advised to go to Lok Nayak hospital by the Delhi government helpline, the family said.“So, we reached there around 6.50am. When we went to the Covid-19 block, a doctor told us to go back to the hospital where he had been tested. The patient was waiting in the car right outside the emergency. As soon as we reached back, he had an attack and fainted,” said Singh.According to the family, after they requested the doctor, he was given oxygen but died within 15 minutes.Lok Nayak hospital, however, has refuted the claim.“The first tweet regarding alleged refusal to admit the patient was posted at 08:05 am and subsequently at 09:08 am the news of the patient’s passing away was shared. Upon investigation of the incident, it was found that the Lok Nayak hospital’s auto-generated electronic casualty record had registered the patient in question as brought dead at 7:37 am,” the hospital said in a release.“The hospital wishes to clarify that the patient was not refused admission and was examined by the doctors upon being brought in,” the release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/67-year-old-dies-of-covid-family-claims-lok-nayak-denied-him-bed/story-8cgfNa0bHkNMn7gOZl43CI.html
04-06-2020||Chandigarh||HC recalls framing of charges order against Mansa court employee||Chandigarh The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday recalled an order that framed charges against a Mansa court employee, Harmeet Singh, for allegedly scandalizing the judiciary by posting videos criticising judges on social networking site, YouTube. While recalling the order passed on Wednesday, the bench of justice Jaswant Singh and justice Sant Prakash said the order was passed presuming that Singh would be present and the charge-sheet would be read over to him. However, due to the covid-19 outbreak, his presence or the lawyers’ presence could not be ensured. “Inadvertently, the aforesaid charge was framed and it was ordered to be read over and explained, but the requirement of the law is that the charge should be read over and explained to the respondent in person,” the bench recorded, adding that ‘mistake’ took place due to hearing being conducted through video conferencing. It added that to impart fair and substantial justice, Singh needed to be given an opportunity of hearing. The matter stands adjourned for September 24. Singh, a clerk is accused of making a page ‘Ugly face of Indian Judiciary, Ludhiana’ and uploading videos lambasting judicial officers by levelling ‘false allegations and conveying wrong message’ to the public. He is also accused of scandalizing the names of sitting judges including that of the high court, by concocting stories of corruption, bribery and nepotism. The court had termed his act as an “attack on the judges”.As per the reference sent to the high court for taking action against him under Contempt of Courts Act, Singh joined in 2009 as a clerk at district and sessions division Ludhiana. He was posted at Jagraon, but he kept pressuring him to transfer him back to Ludhiana. Later, he was transferred to Mansa. This posting was not of his liking and thus he started filing RTIs and opened an account on YouTube, criticising the judges and making allegations against them, the reference says. The contempt proceedings were initiated in 2013 and in 2016 he also faced stoppage of four annual grade increments for his conduct.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-recalls-framing-of-charges-order-against-mansa-court-employee/story-kp1hqdl16grmSo194jYucJ.html

04-06-2020||Lucknow||UP’s top revenue earners fall short of target in April-May||The Uttar Pradesh government’s major revenue earning departments fell short of their target in the first two months of 2020-2021 amid the Covid-19 lockdown. They received only Rs 7,654.17 crore as taxes against the target of Rs 26,318.47 crore, according to official data. After considerably poor earnings in April 2020 due to restrictions, tax revenue witnessed an upward trend in May following the gradual resumption of economic activities. Although the collections reached Rs 5,577.80 crore, this figure was well short of the target of Rs 13,903.19 crore for the month, the same data showed.Under the non-tax head too, revenue realisation from the mining of minor minerals was Rs 296.40 crore against the target of Rs 600 crore in the first two months of 2020-2021. The state government realised Rs 242.24 crore revenue from the mining of minor minerals this month, about 80.7% of the target of Rs 300 crore for May.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, at a video conference with media persons on Sunday, had asserted that the state government’s revenue had gone up considerably and it did not propose to levy any new taxes or cess in the fight against Covid-19. He has asked his team to ensure that the major revenue earning departments meet their targets to ensure an increase in the state government’s kitty.A close scrutiny of the state government’s revenue receipts in the first two months of 2020-2021 indicates excise was the top revenue earner followed by Goods and Services Tax (GST) and VAT (Value Added Tax). The state government received Rs 2169.25 crore as excise duty, which was 58.9% of the target of Rs 3,680.00 crore for May 2020. Cumulatively, the earnings from excise in the first two months (April and May) were Rs 2222.71 crore. The earnings from GST were Rs 3,442.71 crore (32.2% of the target) and Rs 1421.87 crore (43.7% of the target) was realised from VAT.“Yes, the opening of liquor shops has helped the state government in increasing its revenue to some extent in May. Some other economic activities like transport etc are picking up now and this will add to the receipts from VAT as well. In such a situation, the state government needs to have a relook at its priorities and rationalise its expenditure,” said Yashvir Tyagi, former professor of the department of economics, Lucknow University.The state government spends of Rs 12,000 crore to Rs 13,000 crore every month on salaries and pension and it would have to increase the receipts from taxes, along with the non-tax revenue, to meet the committed expenditure in the coming months. Besides freezing the dearness allowance hike and scrapping other allowances, the state government has taken a number of steps to cut down its expenditure to ensure that sufficient funds remain available for salaries and pension to employees and the fight against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-s-top-revenue-earners-fall-short-of-target-in-april-may/story-FGsv0B4Obm7fAv4Nk8eJPK.html

04-06-2020||Chandigarh||Cong patronising illegal liquor trade in Punjab: Kalia||Former Punjab minister and veteran BJP leader Manoranjan Kalia on Thursday accused the state government of patronising illicit liquor trade in Punjab. “The recovery of several unauthorised liquor distilleries in parts of the state speaks volumes about the incompetence and collusion of corrupt politicians of the ruling regime behind it,” he claimed at a press conference.“Instead of taking on drug suppliers, persons close to the Congress leaders are found running illegal distilleries,” Kalia alleged. He also took a swipe at state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal for failing to keep his pre-poll promise of reviving the Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant in his assembly constituency of Bathinda.“The Congress leadership is in a habit of not meeting its public commitments. Over the past six years, the BJP-led NDA government at Centre, however, has worked to strengthen India’s national security and emerged as a strong global entity,” claimed the veteran BJP leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cong-patronising-illegal-liquor-trade-in-punjab-kalia/story-2rvSlq38ZkbLFWrTuxMjvO.html
04-06-2020||Chandigarh||Patience running out in Bapu Dham Colony and Sector 30||Chandigarh: Being barricaded at home and cut off from the rest of the city for about a month now because of the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases here, residents of the containment zones in Bapu Dham Colony and Sector 30 are slowly getting desperate. From fear of contracting the disease, not getting urgently needed medical care to worries over losing jobs, the psychological impact is beginning to be feltThe recent standoff between the residents and the administration, with the former demanding easing of restrictions or withdrawal of containment zone orders indicates that patience of the people locked in is slowly running out.Of the total 302 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the city till date, 226 are from Bapu Dham and 23 from Sector 30. “People are getting desperate here. One can see how it has started affecting youngsters forced to stay indoors. First there was curfew, and then containment. New cases are being reported every day from the colony. We are really worried and wonder when this will end,” says Ajay Koda, a resident of pocket 15, Bapu Dham Colony. LOSING JOBS, NO MEDICAL TREATMENTEven though the administration has assured the residents that it assist them in sorting out problems related to employment, people say their employers are not ready to listen. “So many people have already lost their jobs, what will the administration do now? The longer they remain confined at home the quicker they will lose their source of income and savings,” says a Bapu Dham resident who did not want to be named.People suffering from health ailments too are unable to get medical treatment on time. Navneet Kumar, a resident of Sector 30, says, “My father is suffering from multiple health problems, he is completely bedridden and needs regular medical check-up. Already two deaths have taken place of aged people here. Will administration take the blame if more people die?”Another resident of the locality, Bhuvan Mishra, says, “My 82-year-old grandfather is diabetic and his amputated hand needs dressing and we have to do it ourselves. My friend’s eight-month pregnant wife hasn’t had a single medical check-up in the last two months. Is this the way to live?”STRUGGLING WITH SOCIAL STIGMAOn top of that, the social stigma is not easy to shake off. “We are not the cause of the disease but we are forced to feel guilty,” says Ambedkar, a resident of Bapu Dham.Living in isolation is not easy, says Dr Sandeep Grover, professor, department of psychiatry, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER). “People are facing mental stress, anxiety and the fear of contracting the disease. The degree of the impact of all three on an individual depends on his overall health, age and individual coping mechanism.”On dealing with the stigma, Grover suggests, “They should know that by being in a containment zone they are in fact working for the benefit of the society by helping contain the spread of the disease.”DEMAND TO EASE RESTRICTIONSOn easing restrictions at the Sector 30 containment zone, local councillor Devinder Singh Babla says, “the administration should immediately exclude the locality from the zone. People cannot stand it any more and must be released from this prison.”BDC councilor Daleep Sharma has also reiterated his demand of removing “clean” areas from containment and buffer zones.In the wake of the residents’ protests, the Affected Area Committee met on Thursday at the UT Guest House. “Restrictions in Sector 30 are likely to be removed by Friday, while a decision on Bapu Dham Colony will be taken next week,” says senior UT official who attended the meeting, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/patience-running-out-in-bapu-dham-colony-and-sector-30/story-D5CpoSSfC52vuBkEtvvfxN.html

Singla, who is also director prosecution joined back on February 3.The record of the controversy was perused on Thursday by high court bench of justice Ritu Bahri during resumed hearing of a plea of Satnam Singh Kaler, a joint director with the prosecution department, who has challenged Singla’s extension.“It transpires from the official file that there is noting on January 29, 2020, whereby list of officers was to be presented before the departmental promotion committee (DPC) and after retirement of Singla on January 31, 2020, the CM took a decision to grant extension to him on February 1, 2020, itself as per the noting,” says the order passed by high court on Thursday, after perusing the record and asking the state government to file a detailed reply on the issue.The order says the CM recommended the appointment under Rule 3.26(a) of the Punjab Civil Services Rules under which the state government is empowered to grant an extension, if it is of the opinion that same would be in ‘public interest’.The high court had summoned record on June 3 on the plea after his counsel Shekhar Verma had told the court that Singla had availed two optional extensions in service till January 31. But after retirement, he was re-employed on February 3 on regular basis against a regular post without the approval of finance department and the state cabinet. The petitioner said only two extensions can be granted to an employee as per the Punjab government service rules.Verma had told court that the department initiated process of the DPC for the appointment on January 23 and on January 25, Singla’s retirement orders were passed. The DPC met on February 10 and his name was recommended for promotion. But by that time Singla had joined. Despite him being the only eligible person in the department for promotion to the post of additional director, he was not considered, the petitioner had told the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/capt-recommended-addl-director-prosecution-s-extension-govt-in-hc/story-tWGdySzTbxwL3iKSZE6jOO.html
04-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab govt allows up to 20% relaxation in liquor sale quota||The Punjab excise and taxation department has allowed a relaxation of up to 20% in the minimum guarantee quota for the sale of liquor from May 7 to June 30. It means during the 55-day period, the sale of liquor for 5 to 11 days will be free of all taxes. While the relaxation is 20% in the municipal jurisdiction of Amritsar, Jalandhar and Ludhiana, it will be 10% in the rest of the state. Amendments in the excise policy for the current financial year were cleared on Wednesday. The state government has already exempted the contractors for 36 days from April 1 to May 6, by waiving the minimum guarantee quota. “We can’t get a better deal than this,” said Anil Mahajan, a Hoshiarpur-based liquor contractor. The exemptions announced are subsequent to a report submitted by the group of ministers (GoM) constituted by CM Amarinder Singh on May 12. The GoM comprises cabinet ministers Manpreet Singh Badal, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, Vijay Inder Singla and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot. On January 31, the government had passed the excise policy for the 2020-21 financial year and fixed ₹6,200 crore revenue target. “Since the situation is still volatile, there is a possibility of an extended lockdown. In such a scenario, proportionate reduction should be given in the minimum guarantee revenue on the lines of initial 36 days when liquor vends remained shut,” reads the amendment in the excise policy.INTERCHANGE BEER QUOTA WITH LIQUOR On the demand of contractors, the excise and taxation department has allowed to interchange the beer quota with the country-made or Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL). The state government has already announced to impose Covid cess on liquor sale with effect from June 1. The move will help the government mop up an additional revenue of ₹145 crore in the current financial year. The cess varies from ₹2 to ₹50 depending on the type of liquor and beer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-govt-allows-up-to-20-relaxation-in-liquor-sale-quota/story-o7LwcQdR5VMWtHVkVX0TDN.html
04-06-2020||Chandigarh||Kurukshetra sadhus eagerly look forward to opening of temple doors||The temple priests, pandas, sadhus, shopkeepers, and devotees of Kurukshetra are eagerly waiting for June 8, when the temples of the holy city will reopen after being closed to the devotees for more than two and half months.Ramji Lal, a sadhu, said, “I have never faced such difficulties in my life. Hundreds of sadhus here have been living hand to mouth as the temples were closed and people could not come out from their homes to do any charity.”Reacting to the arrangements made by the government to feed the needy, he said, “They only provide free food to ration or Aadhar card holders. But we are sadhus, we don’t have any identity cards. We survive only on the charity of people.”It was also a tough time for over 120 pandas living in the vicinity of Sanhit Sarovar as their earnings plummeted to negligible levels.“In the past two months, I have earned only ₹1,100 from Yajman (customer). It was very difficult for us to manage as I used to earn above ₹25,000 per month earlier,” said Panda Sehal Mishra.“Let us see how people react to the government’s decision to reopen religious places,” he added. People, who run eateries and religious paraphernalia shops outside the temples said that they were eagerly waiting for June 8 but were not sure whether as many devotees will turn up now.“Since the morning, I have sold only three cups of tea and one samosa. It will take about six months for this situation to normalise,” said Virbhan, a 62-year-old tea vendor at Brahm Sarovar. Amarjit Singh, who sells religious paraphernalia outside the Badharkali Temple, said, “For the past two months, I have been unable to pay rent for my shop and house as my earnings were badly hit owing to the closure of temples amid the lockdown.”“My shop is my only source of income. I am facing difficulties in feeding my family of five,” he added. Shivani, who sells books and idols of Hindu deities at Brahma Sarovar, said, “We are the biggest victims of this lockdown as we have not been able to earn anything in the past two months.” She added, “With the number of cases on the rise, I don’t think the devotees will take the risk to come to temples.”NO DIRECTIONS FROM DIST ADMNEven though the ministry of home affairs has allowed the state governments to reopen religious places in non-containment zones, most of the priests and shopkeepers fear that restrictions on the movement of devotees may continue. They have yet not received any directions from the district administration in this regard.“We know that the union government has allowed us to reopen temples but we don’t have any permission from the district authorities yet, let’s see what they decide upon,” said Karan Dhiman, a clerk at Tirupati Balaji temple.When asked about the plans to reopen the temples, Kurukshetra deputy commissioner Dhirender Khadgata said, “Proper guidelines related to the movement of devotees in temples will be issued as per the directions of the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/kurukshetra-sadhus-eagerly-look-forward-to-opening-of-temple-doors/story-IuQUJcL6Ar6eiFlqoxrguI.html

Sikhs can never forget 1984,” he said.“I am sure the leader of the House will agree that it’s atrocious and many still struggle for justice. But perhaps he can explain to me why – despite recent revelations, demand from the British Sikh community, and support of the Labour Party and other opposition parties – no independent inquiry has been to establish the extent of Thatcher government’s involvement in the 1984 attack,” he questioned.Dhesi, who hails from Raipur village in Jalandhar, is the nephew of Congress leader and SGPC member Paramjit Singh Raipur.In response, leader of the House, MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, said that it is an important anniversary to remember. “The questions raised by Dhesi should be taken up during the adjournment debate.

We are trying to trace where has the congress distributed PPE kits or any other relief material to the needy” he said taking a dig at the opposition.Thakur denied that there were any regularities in the purchase of ventilators in the state. “Opposition party was referring to an anonymous letter on purchase of ventilators that’s in circulation for some time. The allegations made in the letter are frivolous and do not hold any ground,” he said adding that the actual cost of the ventilators the state purchased was ₹9.19 lakh whereas the opposition was quoting prices of ventilators amounting to ₹10.30 lakh which was incorrect,” he added.Referring to irregularities in the purchase of sanitisers at state secretariat he said that the government did not make any payments to the supplier and the staff involved has been booked and chargesheeted,” he said adding that the opposition was making the haywire allegation to impress the party high command. Giving details CM said that ever since the lockdown was induced as many as 1.70 lakh people stranded in different parts of the country returned back to the state. He said that 976 buses were pressed into service that ferried 22,000 people. He said that further 2,200 buses were put in service to transport 45,000 people from one place to another during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jai-ram-plans-counter-offensive-against-congress-accuses-them-of-making-frivolous-allegations/story-yuQR7zb52G5Nc8ggVFmWuI.html

Bittu and his wife Anupama, who are dog-lovers and own two pet dogs – a Shih Tzu and a St Bernard –said that everyone should come forward to help animals.“We should take care of animals and do our bit for their welfare. I came to know about this abandoned Pitbull through an HT report. As I am in Delhi, my staff has handed over Rs 10,000 to mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu for the upkeep of the dog. I would bear the expenses till the MC tracks down the actual owner,” he said.The dog caught from Ishar Nagar has been kept in a cage at MC’s animal birth control centre since April. A bill of over Rs 6,000 is pending towards a chicken shop owner as the dog eats nothing but chicken. While the MC is struggling to find the dog’s owner, the staff was in dilemma over the rising cost of its diet.MC senior veterinary officer Dr Harbans Dhalla said, “The MC had filed a complaint with Jamalpur police to locate the owner of the dog. In May a woman had called MC office claiming ownership but failed to show up. She said that she lives in Jamalpur but will come to take possession of the dog after May 25 as she is stuck in Patna due to lockdown.”Dhalla appreciated the efforts of MP Bittu and said that if anyone had any leads on whereabouts of the dog’s owner, they should share the information on 9815091107.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mp-bittu-comes-to-ludhiana-mc-s-rescue-to-arrange-pitbull-s-feed/story-UrkCkNEicVdPv5D7UTBg1K.html

Gagandeep, 41, of Haibowal said he had been working at the railway station from the past 11 years and was the only earning member of the family of five. “We had no work left after rail services were suspended,” he said. “We had nothing to eat at home and did not get any relief from the government. Some NGOs provided food and ration to the family. I was so depressed that I was thinking about ending my life, but did not do so because there would be no one left to take care of my family.”Adding that porters’ earnings were at par with labourers, Partap Kumar, 39, district president, Lal Wardi (red uniform) Union, said the government had sent ration to labourers, run special trains for them and also extended financial help to them, but the porters were not given any relief.“I have four growing children, but due to the lockdown I have nothing to feed them. I had decided to work as a labourer but nothing was available as all factories were closed and construction work had stopped,” said Kumar.“As rail services have resumed we came to the railway station hoping to get some work. Hardly one or two passengers want us to carry their luggage. We hope things return normal soon,” he added.Jai Bhagwan, 44, a resident of Kabir Basti at the Dhuri Lines, said there was a lesser chance of them dying of Covid-19 and more chances of them starving.About 52 coolies work at the Ludhiana Railway station.Most of them say they have been sending repeated representations to railway authorities for getting the status of Class-4 employees, but no one had listened to their pleas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/weighed-down-by-poverty-ludhiana-coolies-desperate-to-start-work-again/story-nTaJ11VoZ5vMS1af1gwyOO.html

The government has announced financial aid of Rs 4 lakh to the kin of those who lost their life. His mother, Manjabai Nawale (68), had died on Wednesday after a wall and a portion of the roof of their house caved in due to heavy rainfall in the area. Narayan was also injured in the accident.

There is no mechanism to address problems faced by the common man. Nobody responds to the calls on helpline numbers notified by the administration,” Mir said.“Due to the absence of a proper mechanism to connect with people, middlemen have been minting money for addressing issues of the people,” he added. “Even panchayat leaders are not being attended by the administration. We are feeling dejected and cheated after contesting these elections. If we cannot serve the people at this hour then what is the need of becoming a chairman and or sarpanch,” Mir said. Apprehending large scale bungling in Covid-19 expenditures, particularly in establishing quarantine centres and distribution of masks by the district administrations, Mir said,” An inquiry commission should be constituted immediately to know how many masks have been given to people in rural areas and how much money has been spent for quarantine centres.” Mir also appealed J&K L-G GC Murmu and chief secretary BVR Subramanyam to set up a commission to investigate about bills and payments drawn against developmental works during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-mechanism-to-address-problems-faced-by-people-in-j-k-panchayat-conference-chairman/story-UnIhq7JBrOTfHoF97P5XwN.html

While the BJP-led government surpassed all other governments in giving lofty slogans and tall assurances of youth empowerment, the actual delivery was in inverse proportion to the articulation of the said promises, Singh said.Never before had the educated youth of J&K been so marginalised, cheated and humiliated as during the BJP government said Singh while drawing the attention of the State Advisory Council especially towards the pathetic condition of the disengaged health professionals and others made to polish shoes on the roadside. Seeking the revocation of disengagement orders of all terminated employees of the health department, information department, PHE, education department besides other contractual and daily rated workers, Harsh Dev said that the government’s move to oust the bread earners of the respective families had operated very harshly against the educated youth during the coronavirus pandemic. And while the Prime Minister had been repeatedly making media announcements that none was being disengaged, the ground situation was totally different from massive retrenchments having been affected by the government, regretted Singh. Castigating the BJP government for its doublespeak, Singh called for the reinstatement of all SRO-24 ousted employees of the health and information departments and the contractual lecturers of schools and colleges. He said that the lecturers engaged on a contractual basis during 2019-20 should be allowed to continue for the next academic session of 2020-21 as well in view of the pandemic. Seeking age relaxation in the new recruitments to be made by the administration, Singh said that the SAC must consider the issue in view of negligible employment having been created during the past 4-5 years in J&K. He said that the youth had hardly any employment opportunities in the past due to which several of them had become over-aged and needed to be accommodated by the government granting suitable relaxation in age and criteria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/educated-youth-in-j-k-treated-most-shabbily-by-present-regime-former-minister-harsh-dev/story-7fnPVzaLRwBQJzK2Bj7z3N.html

04-06-2020||Lucknow||With masks, social distancing, riders keep date with World Bicycle Day||Unlock-1 coupled with the World Bicycle Day (June 3) prompted recreational cycling clubs and cyclists to resume organised group rides after a hiatus of two months. Over five different groups rode different routes in the city at the crack of the dawn.Nearly 100 men, women and children (above the age of 10) mostly from Cyclopedia, Pedal Pushers, Aero Activity Club and Arun’s Pathshala, got into the saddle with masks and while observing social distancing.Cyclists had resumed daily rides since the start of the Lockdown 4.0, but cycling clubs had not announced or conducted any group rides since March 22.“We are glad that we did not miss the day. On April 12, 2018, the United Nations had designated June 3 as World Bicycle Day. So, since the first World Bicycle Day on June 3, 2018, Lucknow cyclists have kept their date with the day every year. But this time, due to the protracted lockdown, we were uncertain. Luckily, Unlock-1 came into force on June 1, and the clubs could go ahead with their organised rides,” said TCS Lucknow senior manager Sandeep Joshi (49) of Pedalyatri: mostly a club of endurance cyclists. On Wednesday, Joshi rode 50 kilometres solo from Faizabad Road, Kisan Path and through Kukrail forest.Aero Activity Club rode with nine riders, including one woman. They took off on a 40 km ride from Polytechnic Crossing, went to Indira Dam and returned. Their trip began at 5.30 am and finished at 8 am. “Although our club is large, we rode with only nine to manage the group well because of social distancing norms. It feels great to be back in group rides,” said club manager and HAL Lucknow engineer Jogendra Meena, 36.Fifteen riders of Arun’s Pathshala cycled from the 1090 crossing and ended their outing passing through HCL, Ekana International Cricket Stadium and Janeshwar Mishra Park.Pedal Pushers rode under the banner of Cyclopedia, the largest cycling club of Lucknow. The Cyclopedia ride had 42 riders who rode 35 km from Indira Nagar to Indira Dam and back. Some new riders joined the club on the day. Four women--Usha Singh, Shalini Tiwari, Shalini Pawah, and Arti--participated in the ride.Cyclopedia members also had a laughter session to mark the World Laughter Day that fell on May 2, but could not be celebrated outdoors.It also turned out as the biggest recreational-sports activity since lockdown 1.0.Shaurya Mathur, 12, who rode with Cyclopedia said: “I love cycling. Last year I notched up my biggest achievement when I rode a 100km in a ride with my grandfather. I was ecstatic when this ride was announced. I quickly registered for it. Today’s ride was pleasant and it wiped away all lockdown blues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/with-masks-social-distancing-riders-keep-date-with-world-bicycle-day/story-WpYbntHJrm36uPY4hqkUnJ.html

04-06-2020||Mumbai||Governor’s statement on final year exams worries students, colleges||Students and colleges are confused after Governor and chancellor of state universities, Bhagat Singh Koshiyari, released a statement against chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray’s decision to cancel final year exams. Many approached the government, demanding clarity on the status of examinations so that students’ psychological distress can be reduced. “Everyone was relieved to hear the CM’s decision of promoting students without exams. At a time when Covid-19 cases are increasing by the minute, how can exams for lakhs of students be conducted without risking their lives?” said a senior professor from a suburban college. He added that such contradictory views and decisions by two government officials are causing stress to the students.On May 31, Thackeray had said that all final year students will be promoted based on an aggregate of their performance in previous semesters. He added that if any student is not satisfied with the score, he or she can better their performance by appearing for exams in October-November.Koshiyari, however, said that promoting students without exams will jeopardise their future and clarified that as the chancellor of universities, he has the higher authority in such matters.Last month, state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant, in a Facebook live had said that while the state plans to hold final year exams in July, the same would be reconsidered if lockdown in the state is extended till June 30. With the Centre’s decision to extend lockdown till June end, students had assumed they won’t have to appear for exams. “We have requested the CM to issue a government order upholding the state’s decision on May 31 and promote students on the basis of aggregate scores. This is keeping in mind the larger interest of all students and their well being,” said Siddarth Ingle from the Maharashtra Students Union (MASU). The request letter was sent to the CM office on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/governor-s-statement-on-final-year-exams-worries-students-colleges/story-CQbim0S0b6TNRBVwRGjPeK.html

04-06-2020||Mumbai||Edu dept to take action against schools pressuring parents for fee payment||Even as the state education department has warned schools against putting pressure on parents for delayed payment of fees, several schools in the city are now using coercive means to push parents into paying.Barely three days after the education department released a list of nodal officers to address complaints from parents, officers said they have been flooded with calls from parents. “I get nearly 10-20 calls each day from parents of different schools saying the school is pressuring them. We are taking note of all the complaints and will start sending notices to the schools from Monday,” said Bhaskarrao Babar, assistant director, Mumbai region. On Thursday, parents of Oxford International School in Kandivli (East) said some of them were removed from the school’s online learning group citing non-payment of dues. “We regret to inform you that students who have not paid the dues will not be a part of the online teaching group,” read a message sent to the parents by the school management. “We have complained to the education department on behalf of the parents. It is really unfair that the school is treating children in this manner in a crisis situation,” said Chetan Pednekar, vice-president, Maharashtra Navnirman Vidyarti Sena. When HT contacted Avinash Jadhav, trustee of the school, he said, “We were not aware of the fact that such a message had gone to the parents. I have asked the school principal to get it fixed. Parents won’t have to worry as their children would be added back.”Another school in Andheri asked teachers to call parents to remind them about fee payment. “Some of us have not been able to clear dues owing to the current situation. Every day, we get calls from teachers asking us to deposit the money. This is no less than torture,” said another parent. According to a Government Resolution released in the first week of May, schools cannot hike fees for the academic year 2020-21 and have to allow parents to pay fees in instalments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/edu-dept-to-take-action-against-schools-pressuring-parents-for-fee-payment/story-UZ5rrQJU7tepEPJ3llCrCO.html
04-06-2020||Delhi||Migrant artisans mortgaged plots for loans to travel home to found them destroyed by Amphan||Mafizul, a migrant artisan working in south Delhi’s Shahpur Jat, left for his village in West Bengal’s Medinapur on May 18. He travelled aboard a private bus he hired using the money his family had sent him by mortgaging their land, not knowing that he would find his home in ruins three days later. The 35-year-old artisan was among thousands of people who lost their homes in Cyclone Amphan, which hit West Bengal on May 20. Mafizul and several other artisans employed in embroidery units in Shahpur Jat — which houses many designer clothing stores—had spent every last penny to hire private buses to return to their hometowns last month when they were rendered jobless amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Each of them had spent ₹4,200 for a seat on a bus that was travelling to West Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar. Some of them had to resort to taking loans or mortgaging a piece of land to arrange money for their travel. However, many of these artisans, who returned to the Keshpur area of west Mediapur district in West Bengal, now have nowhere to go since their houses were destroyed in the cyclone. Speaking over the phone on Tuesday, Mafizul said that his family waited for two months for the trains to start functioning after the lockdown was announced. “Every day was like a battle for us without work. When my mother had a heart attack, my brother mortgaged our land and sent money to us to book a bus ticket and come home. It took three days to reach home. The cyclone hit our area a day before we reached and destroyed our house. We have nowhere to go now. My ailing mother is living at a relative’s place. My wife, two kids and I have now also come to stay with a relative after completing our 14-day quarantine. We do not know what to do. We don’t have resources to build even a mud house again. All the money we had was exhausted during the two months of lockdown in Delhi,” he said.Another migrant artisan Ariful, 28, who had been working at the embroidery unit in Shahpur Jat for the last eight years, said that his house in Keshpur was also destroyed in the cyclone last month. “After a two-month-long struggle, we came home only to witness this. I had never imagined that another catastrophe was waiting for me at home. I am still at the quarantine centre at a school here. I don’t know how my old parents must be surviving. I don’t have money to help them. I will try to come back to Delhi to find work at the earliest,” he said over the phone.Mujibur Rahman, another artisan from the locality, said, “It took so much effort to reach home in search of peace but we did not know we would be left without a home here as well. I have also lost my cattle in the cyclone. I am an embroider and I have not done any other work in my life. I don’t know what will I do if I don’t get my job back in Delhi.” His family is now living under a makeshift tent, he said.Sunil Kumar Aledia, a social activist, who works for the homeless in Delhi, said that he is in contact with 20 such families of migrants who have recently returned to West Bengal’s West Medinapur district and found their homes and agricultural lands destroyed in the cyclone. “They have nowhere to go now. Many of them have spent all their savings and even took loans to travel home. Now they are again struggling in the aftermath of the cyclone. We are raising funds for them now and we request those in the embroidery business to come forward and offer them work,” he said.When contacted, the Block Development Officer (BDO) of Keshpur Deepal Bose said that the administration is monitoring the situation. “We are conducting inquiries to assess the loss caused by Amphan. In my block, more than 600 houses were destroyed. We are providing all possible relief to the people affected by the cyclone,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/migrant-artisans-mortgaged-plots-for-loans-to-travel-home-to-found-them-destroyed-by-amphan/story-LMOtStn7yYoOEIrRkJpyzM.html

Noting that many Kashmiris had been languishing in jails over several years, some without trial, Tarigami asked the government to give them a fair chance to defend themselves in court.We have maintained that dissent should always have a place in a democratic society. Curbing the dissent and those holding a contradictory viewpoint has proved counterproductive, he said.He said the low-speed internet was impeding the work-from-home (WFH) regimen of professionals, including doctors, and students attending online classes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/release-political-prisoners-without-further-dilly-dally-tarigami/story-ipRxv96QthUmGhBFZrSbZN.html

The decision to cancel the visit comes against the backdrop of the continuing standoff between China and India in Ladakh.The CM’s office in Shimla did not ascribe any reasons for the change in the chief minister’s schedule. Thakur was scheduled to visit Sumdo, strategic post in Lahaul-Spiti. Sumdo lies between Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur districts and has a large military base.The CM was to inspect developmental activities and welfare work in the border areas. VIGIL STEPPED UP ALONG CHINESE BORDER The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and Indian Army have stepped up vigil along the international border with China in Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti districts after Chinese choppers violated the Indian air space twice in April and then in the first week of May. Chinese choppers were spotted twice in Sumdo. Himachal Pradesh shares 260 kilometers of porous border with China. The border areas are manned by the ITBP and Indian Army. The Chinese army has constantly been strengthening its infrastructure along the international border in Himachal Pradesh though the region remained peaceful during the 1962 aggression. After the boundary standoff between India and China in Ladakh and the eastern sector in Sikkim, armies from both countries have stepped up activity along the international border in Himachal Pradesh.CROSS-BORDER TRADE SUSPENDED This year, the annual cross-border trade between the two countries was put on hold due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the standoff between the troops. Trade between the two countries usually starts in June and ends in November. No trader has registered themselves for bilateral trade through the Shipki La that had reopened in 1993 after it was shut due to the Indo-China war in 1962. Shipki La is a mountain pass that connects Kinnaur district to the China controlled Tibetan Autonomous Region.

04-06-2020||Lucknow||Coronavirus creeps into UP’s rural areas now||While the spread of coronavirus has stabilised to a certain extent in the urban and A-class cities of Uttar Pradesh, barring districts bordering Delhi, the infection now seems to be spreading in the rural belt.The districts like Kannauj, Auraiyya, Farrukhabad, Unnao, Etawah, Sultanpur, Firozabad, Basti and Ayodhya are now reporting more corona cases.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHealth experts claim that this is mainly due to the return of migrant workers, especially those who escaped medical screening or were asymptomatic.In Kannauj, for instance, a mother-daughter duo who had returned from Gurugram, infected ten members of their family in the Galla Mandi area of Chhibramau, which has turned from green to orange zone now. Kannauj had reported 12 cases on Tuesday.On Wednesday, three more persons tested positive for Covid-19 in Farrukhabad, six positive patients were detected in Auraiyya, five in Unnao and four in Etawah.Kannauj Chief Medical Officer Krishna Swaroop said, “With this large-scale influx of migrants from urban cities to villages, the rural areas cannot be ignored and need special attention as far as monitoring is concerned. Infected people are being home quarantined or admitted to hospitals with the help of community management.”The district authorities have roped in block development officers, besides village heads and Civil defence volunteers, to take due care to avoid the spread.A senior health official said that the situation is alarming in rural pockets where the majority of the people use one water sources -- whether a well or a hand pump.“Migrants who have returned to the villages, are escaping quarantine centres and violating safety protocols. There is no resistance form the local people too, because most cases are asymptomatic,” he said.The official further said that social distancing was an alien concept in rural areas where people tend to collect even at the slightest provocation.“Besides, the wedding season is beginning and social distancing will be hard to maintain.

04-06-2020||Health:||Demand surges for gym equipment, prices too!||With over two months of lockdown hampering access to gyms, fitness enthusiasts are having a hard time, as the equipment required for exercising at home has seen a massive surge in pricing.Karol Bagh resident Archit Juneja had bought equipment before the lockdown, but was shocked to see the surge in prices. “Before the lockdown, dumbbells weighing 1kg costed ₹80, now the same costs ₹150. Basically, all gym equipment has become double the original price,” he says, adding, “Without gym, I am getting tutorials from Instagram, YouTube, fitness apps and live-streaming workout classes.”And in order to keep up with exercise routine and stay active, at-home workouts, some are even borrowing from friends to avoid purchasing at jacked-up prices. Rajouri Garden resident Vibhav Chandhok, a model and yoga teacher in Germany, says, “Being unable to go to the gym, I’m only focusing on body weight exercises, kettlebell swings and yoga. I borrowed it from a friend as I won’t be able to carry them along.”Some gym owners have even taken to renting their equipment to make up for missing revenues and staying connected with their members. “Abhi business toh poora hi bandh hai. Kuch toh kamana padega. It was my customers who gave me this idea. I decided to give basic, light-weight equipment on rent to set up home gyms for the time being,” says a gym owner from Lajpat Nagar. He also adds, “This way, I can somehow manage to adjust the fees as well that we take in advance packages.”Interact with author/sanchita_kalra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/fitness/demand-surges-for-gym-equipment-prices-too/story-DKUnL1uMbmnEGEwjwrGn3H.html

We will organize a state-wide physical protest against BJPs virtual rally and demand guarantee for ensuring food, employment and safety from Coronavirus,” Singh said.The Left parties also demanded that the Centre pay Rs 7500 per month for next six months to each families who are not included in the income tax limit, every person should be given 10 kg of grains, 200 days and MNREGA work with enhanced wage.Earlier in the day, RJD announced that it would observe ‘Garib Adhikar Diwas’ on June 7 too, to protest against the NDAs “insensitivity” in dealing with Covid crisis that led to problems of migrants.Rescheduling the partys ‘Garib Adhikar Diwas’ to June 7, Leader of Opposition in Bihar Assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said that “the government wants to hide the actual ground realities through its gimmickry by holding virtual rally.” “We have rescheduled our Garib Adhikar Diwas programme from June 9 to June 7 to protest against saffron partys indifference and insensitivity shown to the people especially migrants (during lockdown),” Yadav said in a video message.“We will try to wake up the government for its insensitivity - shown towards migrants, farmers, youths who got unemployed during lockdown - by beating thali-katora (plate-bowl) as a mark of protest,” he added.The BJP could have used the digital medium in mitigating the problems of people especially poor but they did not do so because they have “nothing to do with poor people”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/after-rjd-left-parties-to-observe-vishwasghat-dhikkar-diwas-to-protest-bjp-s-virtual-rally-on-june-7/story-uunA3cJjoNvLhmza8iokSP.html

04-06-2020||Patna||Why call an Indian going from one state to another for work as ‘pravasi’: Nitish||Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday took exception to the use of word “pravasi” (migrant) for people going from one state to another for work, even as he slammed private companies outside Bihar for not caring for their employees during Covid-19 pandemic, forcing them to return home in distress. Kumar said now a vast majority of the state’s citizens have returned and his government is making arrangements to engage them economically at home itself. “We want nobody should go outside for livelihood as ‘majboori’ (compulsion)...if someone wants to go of his/her volition that is another thing,” Kumar said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage “Nowdays a word ‘pravasi’ is in circulation for people going from one state to another state for work. Why should they be called migrants when being Indians they can move around anywhere in the country,” he asked, adding “the word (pravasi) can be used if one goes out of the country”. The Bihar chief minister strongly criticised private companies for not taking proper care of their employees which forced them to return homes in distress during the coronavirus outbreak. “I have been pained by this. I want that nobody from Bihar should go out in compulsion for livelihood...everybody should get work at home itself,” he said. Kumar was interacting with the representatives of panchayati raj institutions, urban local bodies, Jeevika didis (women self help groups members) and officials through video conference and web-casting. Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi and Health Minister Mangal Pandey also addressed the function. Kumar said he has directed departments like that of rural and urban development and others to create job opportunities for people who have returned during the Covid-19 crisis along with those already living in the state. He said efforts are made to increase persondays in MGNREGA, Jaal Jeevan Hariyali Mission (environmental campaign schemes) and road construction among others to economically absorb the influx of manpower. Though there is no exact count of the returnees to Bihar, on the basis of people approaching the government online and reaching out over telephones, its estimated to be over 25 lakh. Reports have also been suggesting that maximum numbers of Shramik Special trains are going to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. With assembly elections scheduled in Bihar before the end of this year, plight of migrants is emerging as an important poll issue. Stating that victims of disaster have the first right over the state’s exchequer, Kumar said the government has so far spent Rs 8,583.52 crore for providing relief to the people affected due to coronavirus. On an average, Rs 5,300 has been spent per person who has been kept at a quarantine centre for a mandatory 14 days on return from outside, he added. The government has constituted Coronavirus Eradication Fund which has Rs 180 crore in its kitty. Health Department could buy necessary medicines and equipment such as test kits, PPEs etc, he said. The government has given Rs 1,000 as special assistance under a scheme from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund to more than 20 lakh people who were stuck outside the state due to lockdown, he said, adding that Rs 1,000 has been given to each ration card holding family and even to those who are yet to get ration cards. So far, 1.41 crore ration card holding families and 21 lakh families who would be given ration cards soon have benefited from the scheme, he said and added that Rs 1,620 crore has been spent on it. The Education Department has spent Rs 3,261 crore on account of scholarships, uniform and other schemes, he said and added that Rs 1,017 crore has been spent for making payment of three months in advance to 85 lakh beneficiaries of different social security pension schemes. Similarly, the government has also sanctioned Rs 730 crore for providing agriculture subsidy input to farmers whose crops were damaged during rain/hailstorm that took place in the months of February, March and April, the chief minister said. A total of Rs 417 crore has been distributed as agriculture subsidy input among 12.35 lakh farmers so far, he added. Regarding Covid-19, he said whoever is being tested as positive should be kept in an isolation centre. He said the number of beds at these centres would be enhanced to 40,000 from current 13,496 beds for which private commercial buildings are being used. Making an appeal to the people to wear masks for their protection, Kumar said there is no shortage of masks in the state as they are being made at a large scale by Jeevika didis and people residing in quarantine centres. There is no need to panic due to coronavirus, rather people have to remain alert and vigilant, he said. “We have to wear masks to protect ourselves from coronavirus besides maintaining cleanliness and hygiene. There is less number of coronavirus cases in Japan as there is a tradition of wearing masks there,” Kumar said to drive home the point.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/why-call-an-indian-going-from-one-state-to-another-for-work-as-pravasi-nitish/story-IpMbjJlM5wcTnr8jNRVhyK.html

04-06-2020||City||Delhiwale: A daughter’s lockdown curls||The coronavirus-triggered closure of the world is doing different things to different people. Many citizens are rushing back to their distant homes in great difficulties. And those who are lucky enough to be already locked up in their houses are struggling to cope with this unprecedented suspension of life by using all the creativity at their disposal. Among this set of people, some are creating a new version of themselves by learning to wash the bartans with a minimum quantity of water in the kitchen sink, or keeping a daily pandemic journal, or even rustling out perfectly round rotis—you must have seen all these wonders on your friends’ TikTok and Facebook updates of course.Saumya Pande too hewed out a new version of herself in this difficult period. “I got myself naturally curled hair in the lockdown,” she gushes. Ms Pande, 46, is chatting on WhatsApp video from the isolation of her apartment in Noida, that she is currently sharing with her ailing father and his full-time caretaker. Her two sons live in Gurugram.An associate professor heading the department of fashion in a design institute in south Delhi, she gamely shows her crowning glory through the phone screen that connects her to this reporter. Her long wild curly hair are falling down like a cascading sea of ringlets.This new spectacle of hers is actually as much about the lockdown as about her mother, the late author Pratima Pande.“Maa was my biggest inspiration.... she was also very beautiful, with long straight hair (see the black & white pic), and was often compared to (actor) Waheeda Rehman.”But her mother never let Ms Pande grow her hair long while she was a child, partly because she wanted her little “Cookie” to first grow up herself so that she could look after her hair on her own. “In fact, she hated curls,” laughs Ms Pande, exclaiming that “Maa got my head tonsured seven times before I turned five!”Looking into the phone screen, she cheerfully says that “I got my natural curls in the lockdown simply by refusing to comb the hair!“In the BC (Before Corona) era, when people were still obliged to be physically present in the office, Ms Pande rarely found time in her hectic schedule to immerse herself deeply in everyday grooming. “Having a shower was a rushed affair,” for instance. But as she found herself stranded at home with the imposition of lockdown in late March, she slowed her life. She also started to spend more time in the shower “and developed routines like oiling my body, bathing more leisurely.” It gave her the opportunity to recall memories of her mother loudly singing Gayatri Mantra while in the shower “and the prayers wouldn’t even stop as Maa would emerge out, all dressed up, from the bathroom, and amble towards the pooja (prayer) corner in our home.”One day, more than a month ago, Ms Pande came out of her bath and discovered ringlets in her hair. “The hair looked undone... they had curled up on their own... I was sort of liking it.”Ms Pande soon realised that “if I don’t dry and comb my hair after the wash, they start curling up naturally.” She also Googled to discover other tricks—like scrunching—to make her hair go curly in a natural way.Ms Pande’s mother passed away in 2011, aged 67. “Something had snapped in her after my brother, a squadron leader in the Indian Air Force, died in a MiG-21 fighter crash.”One wonders how Ms Pande’s friends react on seeing her curly avatar on Zoom meets. The lady laughs, saying, “I think they are finding it a bit exotic! Very different from my Bihari lineage of straight no-fuss hair... this is more me—bohemian and carefree.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhiwale-a-daughter-s-lockdown-curls/story-POacGj3GodHNDABSnXsCUP.html
04-06-2020||Mumbai||4 people dead, 7 districts severely affected in Maharashtra due to Cyclone Nisarga||Cyclone Nisarga, a severe cyclonic storm, which made landfall south of Alibag in Raigad district, left behind a trail of destruction of damaged power supply lines, trees fallen over roads, tin roofs blown away from tenements all along the Konkan coastline of Maharashtra on Wednesday, even as the state evacuated close to 85,000 people from seven districts, including Palghar, Ratnagiri, and Thane among others.Two people in Raigad district and two more in Pune district died, while eight people were injured in Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri, state officials confirmed. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and his deputy Ajit Pawar reviewed the situation in the morning, with district collectors and divisional commissioner. Thackeray directed the administration to launch rescue operations and survey damage to life and property. He later thanked the people of Maharashtra. “Even as Maharashtra is battling with the Covid-19 crisis, the cyclone stormed at its coastal part. The state stood unitedly and successfully to face this challenge. I am sure this unity will help us in tide over Covid-19 crisis too,” he said. As it passed over the coastline, Nisarga spanned 500 kms captured by radar and encompassed Mumbai and Thane districts, the IMD stated. Its eye was about 80 kms in diameter — by all measures, it was every bit the severe cyclonic storm that the states were bracing for. However, cyclones tend to lose speed the more they travel inland, and by Wednesday 8pm, Nisarga had made its way towards Pune and was headed in a northeastwards direction towards Madhya Pradesh at a speed of 60-70 kmph.Though the cyclone completed landfall between 12.30 and 2.30 pm, its intensity lasted for another hour afterwards. Alibag received 84.3 mm of rain between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm on Wednesday, while Ratnagiri district, south of the cyclone’s landfall site, recorded 45 mm in the same time period, according to district administration data. “The entire district is cyclone-hit,” Nidhi Choudhari, the district collector of Raigad, said, as she assessed the extent of damage with the NDRF team. “It struck us exactly at Diveagar, and later moved towards Alibag and Pen tehsils. The impact was felt as far as Margaon, Khopoli and Karjat (inland) where tree and electric lines were badly damaged.” Choudhari estimated at least 10,000 trees had been affected.Seven districts will continue to remain on alert till Thursday morning. According to the press statement issued by the state government, the cyclone is near Pune after moving on via Alibag-Mumbai-Thane and is weakening. “With further deep depression, moderate rainfall in Pune and Nashik districts is expected.”Revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said the administration has swung into action to restore the infrastructure. “Besides the damages to the roads, electricity infrastructure too has sustained damage leading to the outage of the electricity in many parts. Since the cyclone is moving towards the North Maharashtra, we have issued advisories to the people in Pune, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Dhule,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/4-people-dead-7-districts-severely-affected-in-maharashtra-due-to-cyclone-nisarga/story-kktVssSqaMOyVVJH3qEMsO.html

04-06-2020||Chandigarh||Opposition slams Khattar govt on Covid-19 data mismatch||Slamming the Haryana government for its ‘inept’ handling of Covid-19 data, the state Congress on Wednesday said the government was “asleep at the wheel”.Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said glaring discrepancies in Haryana’s Covid-19 figures were not only perplexing but bordered on the deliberate.“Does chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar realise its serious public health ramifications?” Surjewala asked, reacting to the HT’s report on discrepancies in state’s Covid-19 data vis a vis Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) statistics.The Congress leader said, “How will a blame game resolve the serious flaws in contact tracing and surveillance? Affirmative action needs to be taken.”Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda in a tweet said, “Haryana may head towards a Corona crisis as the government has little data to carry out contact tracing & take remedial action (sic).” Haryana may head towards a Corona crisis as the government has little data to carry out contact tracing & take remedial action. Urge the government, testing companies to come together to resolve this crisis. Important news break by Hitender Rao of @htTweets pic.twitter.com/r4eRGD56yo‘Take action against pvt labs’Reacting to the Covid-19 data discrepancy, former leader of opposition and INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala said it only demonstrated the callousness of the state government. “It is shocking to know that private labs are not informing the government about Covid-19 testing and positive cases. And, they are also getting away with it. Punitive action should be taken against such private labs and FIRs should be registered against them,” he said, adding that data discrepancy can have serious ramifications in a pandemic situation.Chautala said health minister Anil Vij should adopt a proactive approach in the matter:“Vij is also the home minister and should get the matter investigated rather than keeping people in the dark. The government needs to restore public confidence,” he said.PVT LABS TOYING WITH LIVES: BALRAJ KUNDUIndependent MLA from Meham, Balraj Kundu, who had withdrawn his support to the BJP-JJP government, said health authorities in the state had no clue about what was happening on the ground. “Strict action should be initiated against the errant private labs. By suppressing Covid-19 testing data they are toying with the health and lives of people of Haryana,’’ the independent MLA said.Kundu said that it was unfortunate that Haryana health authorities failed to check the private labs.“Anil Vij is an outspoken minister, but his words have no impact. In a crisis like this, people of the state want action,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/oppn-slams-khattar-govt-on-covid-data-mismatch/story-rAsDc8aQKWZ6bUcG3U7tbL.html

The action against the farmers came a day after Hindustan Times highlighted how paddy was transplanted before June 15 in violation of the state government’s order. A team comprising agriculture and revenue department officials uprooted paddy sown in Mahmudpur, Kunjpura, Khirajpur, Bada Gaon and Bibipur villages. Karnal agriculture department SDO Sunil Bazad said, “The action was taken after reports poured in from several places about farmers sowing paddy in clear violation of government’s order which banned the preparation of paddy nursery before May 15 and transplantation before June 15.”He said on the directions of deputy commissioner (DC) Nishant Kumar Yadav, paddy was destroyed by spraying weedicides.

On April 24, one Sukhwinder Kaur, her sister Sandeep Kaur, aunt Jasbir Kaur and another relative Mandeep Singh had barged into Ramandeep’s home and assaulted her with sticks and metal pipes.Ramandeep had made a complaint to the police, but to no avail.

On May 31, an FIR was lodged under all bailable sections of the Indian Penal Code.”“My daughter submitted her medical legal report and proof of trespassing, but the ASI denied adding more sections in the FIR. He demanded ₹70,000 for that,” he added.Senior superintendent of police (SSP, vigilance) Rupinder Singh said a trap was laid and the ASI was nabbed while accepting the bribe.A case under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act was registered against the accused cop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-asi-held-for-accepting-bribe-for-adding-sections-to-fir/story-RZ5UuqctD9QaWZrwjE2YZP.html
04-06-2020||Chandigarh||On World Bicycle Day, iconic Atlas slams brakes on operations||After years of losses that were amplified during the coronavirus-induced lockdown, Atlas Cycles, one of country’s oldest bike-maker, shut its operations on Wednesday.Ironically, the company’s decision to wind up its last working unit in Sahibabad (Ghaziabad) came on the World Bicycle Day. The iconic cycle company was into manufacturing business since 1951. The Sahibabad unit has the capacity to manufacture more than 4 million cycles per annum with a 1,200-strong workforce.“Post lifting of lockdown with effect from June 1, 2020, the Sahibabad unit of the company is not in a position to resume manufacturing operations due to financial constraints. Hence, the workforce of Sahibabad unit of the company will be laid off with effect from June 3, 2020, till adequate arrangement of funds is made,” the company said in a public notice.The notice said the severe cash crunch has made it difficult to even procure raw materials. “The situation is expected to continue till the time, company is able to raise revenue,” it said.In December 2014, company’s Malanpur factory in Madhya Pradesh closed down. In February 2018, Atlas Cycles (Haryana) said it was suspending manufacturing at its Sonepat unit with immediate effect.Started by Janki Das Kapur, a man with dreams, in 1951, to provide quality bicycles to countrymen at reasonable prices, Atlas was a brand to reckon with even before Hero and Avon established themselves.What started with an improvised factory shed in Sonepat in 1951, the company rose to establishing major plants in Malanpur (MP), Sahibabad over the years.“They were the biggest importers of cycles in Karachi before Partition. After 1947, they shifted to Sonepat with a dream to start a unit and soon rose to become one of the most trusted cycle companies,” said SS Bhogal of Bhogal Cycles Limited in Ludhiana.“It’s unfortunate that the cycle industry pioneers have shut down,” said DS Chawla, president of United Cycle Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/on-world-bicycle-day-iconic-atlas-slams-brakes-on-operations/story-mNbiuJ5udtDPg9rv00cFiI.html

Alibag is in the path of Cyclone Nisarga and was expected to be the landfall area.There are 12 major schools in the region, 10 of which have been earmarked for Covid-19 care, while the remaining two will cater to Alibag’s evacuated residents. Classrooms across both four-storey buildings of the schools have been at full capacity with relocated persons from Alibag’s Shastri Nagar, Siddharth Nagar, and Alibag Koliwada. The local civic body said it ensured all persons were shifted to the schools three hours before the expected landfall over the south of Alibag. “We faced serious problems with some persons not following the protocol. However, after the cyclone made landfall, we ensured all windows and doors of all classes were shut, and there were no untoward incidents at both schools,” said Mahesh Dafal, city engineer, Alibag municipal council.However, this correspondent observed that all protocols related to Covid-19 were not being followed at both schools. None of the fisherfolk wore masks, nobody had sanitisers, and social distancing was not being maintained between families at any of the classrooms. When Dafal was asked why basic norms were not being followed, he said, “The entire relocation process has been done within a span of 24 hours. We are still organising masks and sanitisers for every floor. It will be done soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/schools-transform-into-cyclone-shelters/story-A4wdmfhj8AAgeVeJbFZnGL.html

Known to locals as the birth place of the first Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath and one of the 16 fortified towns to be ceded to Kanhoji Angre, the chief of Maratha Navy, the town lay forgotten till Imtiaz Ghavte, one of the accused in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case, was arrested by two sub-inspectors at the Worli police station. During investigations, Ghavte had named Tiger Memon, who started as a driver in gangster Dawood Ibrahim’s company, as the main conspirator for the blasts. Police said Ghavte told investigators that Ibrahim and his men had been running a gold and silver smuggling business from Shrivardhan since the late 1980s. Investigations revealed that under the guise of landing silver and gold ingots along the coast, Ibrahim’s henchmen like Dawood Phanse landed Research Development Explosive (RDX) and assault rifles, which were used in the serial blasts.Landing agents of Dawood Ibrahim’s company paid ₹50 per box, instead of the usual ₹5 for transporting silver and gold ingots, to Rashid Alware, a truck owner from Shrivardhan, to transport the explosives, said police. Alware was arrested on April 1, 1993 and later convicted for three years. Since then, however, the town located about 170km from Mumbai, changed its image to become a tourist attraction. Its black sand beaches and remnants of the 18th century fortifications have attracted an influx of tourists over the years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cyclone-nisarga-shrivardhan-faces-another-storm/story-Ffpgr5WVnvO401Q9dpKYLL.html

Between 8am and 5.30pm, 26.4mm rain was recorded in Colaba and 28.4mm in Santacruz (representative of the suburbs). The highest wind speed in the city, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), was 74kmph that was reported around 1.30pm.The city saw 117 tree falls, including 39 in south Mumbai, 40 in the eastern suburbs and 38 in the western suburbs, from 8am to 6pm in the evening, according to BMC data. BMC also recorded 39 incidents of short-circuits. There were nine house collapses – three in south Mumbai, four in the western suburbs and two in the eastern suburbs.Those who were evacuated and housed in 35 schools that have been turned into temporary shelters will be kept under observation for a day and will be screened for temperature and oxygen levels, to detect symptoms of Covid-19, before being permitted to go home. The BMC said it consulted the Odisha government on how to tackle the situation.Iqbal Chahal, BMC chief on Wednesday, said, “We have rescued thousands of those residing along the coast, and have kept them in temporary shelters. We are arranging food and water for them, as per requirement. Many migrants have gone back to their home states, but we were feeding many more and that system enabled us to arrange proper food for all those who were evacuated.Most of them are from the slums and koliwadas on the west coast, including areas such as Colaba, Worli, Versova, Malad, Mahim, Juhu khardanda and Gorai. More than 2,000 fishermen from Colaba and 150 from Worli were evacuated to safe shelters nearby. In G-South ward alone, that covers parts of Worli and Mahalaxmi, 525 people were evacuated.The BMC officials will now focus on removing fallen trees, electric poles on the roads, check the structural stability of several poles and trees and then continue its drive for fumigating the city for the upcoming monsoon.

Over 500 emergency response team members from NDRF, Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) and BMC were on standby. No untoward incident was reported on all six beaches, where fire personnel and lifeguards have been on standby since Tuesday night.IMD has also lowered the rainfall warning for Thursday to moderate. KS Hosalikar, DG of meteorology in IMD Mumbai, said, “We are lowering the rainfall warning to moderate rainfall for less than 24 hours. The cyclonic storm is still there somewhere near Pune, but it will soon settle in.”Heavy rain, however, caused a nullah in Hanuman Nagar, Vikhroli to overflow with silt. The incident came to light when the video went viral. The video was also posted by BJP MLA Ram Kadam. Ajitkumar Ambi, assistant municipal commissioner of N ward (Ghatkopar, Vikhroli), said, “The locals dump their garbage in these drains which led to choking. We cleared it in time.”Tree falls on tracksOne tree fall was reported between Kurla and Vidyavihar railway stations, while branches of a tree fell on railway tracks at Prabhadevi, along with a tree tilting at Mumbai Central station yard on Wednesday. The CR also stopped the toy train between Aman Lodge and Matheran.

04-06-2020||Mumbai||Cyclone Nisarga: SoBo hit more than the suburbs||As the city braced for strong winds and heavy rainfall on Wednesday owing to cyclone Nisarga’s landfall in Shrivardhan in Raigad, the island city of Mumbai was more affected than its eastern and western suburbs. South Mumbai saw more tree collapses and fires due to short circuit. Experts have attributed this to its proximity to the landfall of Nisarga and its narrow geographical outlay that is like an arm extended into the Arabian sea. The southern tip of Mumbai is approximately 96 nautical miles from Shrivardhan. Shubhangi Bhute from Indian Meteorological Department said, “As per IMD forecast, south Mumbai and south of Mumbai was predicted to experience greater wind velocity due to its proximity to the eye and landfall of the cyclone. According to a press release issued by IMD, however, the maximum wind velocity recorded in the suburbs on Wednesday was greater than the wind velocity recorded in the island city. While the island city recorded wind velocity at 50kmph, the suburbs recorded it at 58kmph. However, the highest wind speed in the city was 74kmph reported around 1.30pm by the Colaba observatory, according to KS Hosalikar, director general of meteorology at IMD Mumbai. Corresponding wind velocity for suburbs for 1.30pm was not available until Wednesday evening.Between 8am and 6pm, 117 tree fall complaints were reported in Mumbai of which 39 were from south Mumbai. Of these 39, 24 tree collapses were reported in A ward alone, comprising areas of the southern most tip of Mumbai.BMC on Wednesday morning evacuated over 3,000 residents from Geeta Nagar in Colaba, and another 1,000-odd residents from Ganesh Nagar as part of its measures to evacuate people along the west coast of Mumbai. Chanda Jadhav, assistant commissioner of A ward, said, “This is the tip of Mumbai, closest to location of the landfall of cyclone Nisarga. We had put all precautions in place and evacuated many people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cyclone-nisarga-sobo-hit-more-than-the-suburbs/story-jqLqvllUggpBRFojWincEI.html

While leaving the house, Ekta had also taken away 150gm gold jewelry and some cash from the home.Seema Rani now regrets their decision for not having reported the case to the police. Lamenting over the death of her daughter, Seema Rani said had she made a complaint to the police, her daughter would have been alive today.Seema said her daughter was a commerce graduate and a part-time event manager. She had come in contact with Saqib Khan, a sorcerer, who had met her daughter as Aman. Unaware of his intentions, Ekta had decided to marry him.“In April 2019, Ekta had left home to attend a function in Himachal Pradesh, but did not return. Later, we had come to know that she had eloped with Aman,” said Seema.“We had talked to her for the last time on May 5, 2019. After it, she had neither picked up our calls nor responded to WhatsApp messages. A profile picture on her WhatsApp account kept on changing, but we had no idea that she had already been murdered and cut into pieces by the accused,” she added.After 13 months of recovering a headless body of a woman from a field in Daurala of Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, the police solved the case on Tuesday with the arrest of Aman alias Saqib Khan and his five accomplices.The girl’s family had lodged a complaint against Saqib Khan at the Jagatpuri police post in 2019. But, as the family had come to a compromise with the accused, they had withdrawn the complaint.After Ekta had gone missing, they did not file a complaint assuming that she was not a minor and had left home on her own will.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/for-haibowal-family-their-daughter-was-alive-till-meerut-police-called-them-to-identify-the-body/story-dVEqLjx827LSTV0Ww7HdnO.html
04-06-2020||Chandigarh||As economy unlocks, Shramik trains from Chandigarh see more vacant seats||With businesses and industries opening up in the city as the first phase of the country’s unlocking process begins, migrant labourers seem more willing to stay back rather than going home on the special Shramik trains.More than 98,000 people had registered with the Chandigarh administration expressing their wish to go back to their home states. “But now, a considerable number of migrant labourers are not interested in moving out as industrial and commercial units have resumed operations,” said Yashpal Garg, UT’s social welfare secretary who is also the nodal officer for management of migrant movement, particularly on special trains, from the city. Due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown, which came into effect from March 24, several businesses in the city were shut, leaving the migrant workers jobless and eager to go home. In the third phase of the lockdown when inter-state movement was allowed, the UT administration asked people get themselves registered to travel home in Shramik trains. So far, the Chandigarh administration has sent 27 trains on its own and four in coordination with other states.One day before the scheduled departure of the train, telephone calls are made to registered persons asking them to reach the Holding Centre set up in Sector 26 for medical screening before they are allowed to board the trains. One more train is scheduled to leave on June 5.“On Tuesday, about 10,000 persons were contacted through telephone calls and SMS for the train leaving for Mau, Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday. Though capacity of the train was 1,600, only 1,300 passengers turned up, with 300 seats going vacant,” added Garg. A similar trend was seen in other trains that departed from here. The train to Nazibabad, Gonda and Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh) went with 98 vacant seats. The Shramik special train to Jounpur (Uttar Pradesh) went with 105 vacant seats and in the train to Gaya (Bihar) and Dhanbad (Jharkhand), there were 421 vacant seats.For the special train set to leave on June 5, as many as 6,000 phone calls have already been made but only 800 migrants have booked their tickets so far. “Even though 800 people have booked their tickets, we are not sure if all of them will turn up. This trend has started only since the fourth phase of the lockdown. Earlier, trains ran to their full seating capacity,” he added.Dr Vinod Kumar Chaudhary, professor, sociology, Panjab University, said, “People who are assured of stable income are the ones want to stay back now when the businesses are opening up. These include skilled and semi-skilled workers. Unskilled are still leaving.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/as-economy-unlocks-shramik-trains-from-chandigarh-see-more-vacant-seats/story-qD9AZemBCywJNWq4YGBIBM.html

The post claimed it was an initiative of the Ludhiana police and “Astro Intelligence”. After the initiative drew criticism in the comments, the post was taken down.Dr Amandeep Singh Bains of Dugri, who sent the complaint via e-mail, said believing in astrology was a personal matter. “Hence, police supporting and promoting it is unacceptable. Corona warriors have been working on the frontline for months, and this step of police taking the help of astrologers is inappropriate,” he added.On his part, DCP Chaudhary said he was invited for the talk show to answer callers’ questions regarding the Covid-19 lockdown. He said he was aware that an astrologer was also speaking on the show, but he talked only about the virus and lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/astrology-programme-lands-ludhiana-police-in-soup-local-sends-complaint-to-punjab-cm-dgp/story-mLGs0l2izqRyviWx8S1bRN.html

These inmates were either granted bail or parole as a precautionary measure following a direction by the state government, and more prisoners are expected to come out in the next few days. The jail has a capacity for around 3,000 inmates, but was accommodating over 3,500 prisoners two months ago, giving the jail authorities a tough time in ensuring order at the facility. Authorities have stopped lodging fresh violators in the jail to contain the spread of covid-19. A jail officer said that bail and parole were initially for 45-60 days, which is extendable according to the government’s order. Jail superintendent Baljit Singh Ghuman said there were now around 2,400 inmates and a drive to screen them was launched on Wednesday. Nodal officer for covid-19 at Kapurthala civil hospital Dr Sandeep Dhawan said some samples had been taken and a drive was on to screen patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/33-of-inmates-released-from-kapurthala-jail-over-past-2-months/story-6rtCIpYsiQ9j1bhzFQa23L.html
04-06-2020||City||‘Locals rushed to pick up mangoes while NDRF team cleared trees’||As the wind picked up around 10.30am on Wednesday, news came in that cyclone Nisarga, which had already changed course once, may not make landfall on Alibag after all. After first changing course earlier this week, so that its path crossed south of Mumbai instead of passing over the north of the city, the cylone was now expected to make landfall at Murud, almost 54 kilometres (km) from Alibag.Armed with raincoats, mechanical tree-cutters, rope and other equipment, three teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel moved out of Alibag towards Murud.Since May 31, a day after the India Meteorological Department (IMD) raised a warning about a cyclonic storm brewing in the Arabian Sea, NDRF has had four teams in Alibag. Each team has 23 NDRF personnel.To the journalists at the Alibag camp, NDRF inspector (in-charge of Alibag) Mahesh Kumar said on Wednesday, “If you are here to cover the cyclone, I suggest you stop here with my team and I. Two other vehicles are going to be stationed at possible locations of landfall where there is no shelter. For the next four hours, we can promise your safety, but they cannot.”After Mumbai recorded relatively low rainfall on Tuesday night, independent meteorologists said the cyclone was weakening. When the HT team arrived in Alibag on Wednesday morning, the streets were deserted, the sky was darkly overcast and it was drizzling.Four hours later, the wind was loud and chaotic as it rushed through trees and there was the percussion of tin sheds bouncing as the wind tugged at them. A few flew off.At 12.15pm Wednesday, Kumar announced Cyclone Nisarga had made landfall. “I did not expect the weather system would maintain its severe cyclone status after landfall. In fact, it is moving at 110 kmph at the location we are at,” said Kumar after reading out the latest message from IMD off his phone.Information on the impact of the cyclone in Raigad district started coming in to NDRF swiftly. “We carried out extensive awareness sessions across villages and with district officers from March 31 itself, and explained to those being relocated to shelters to keep a track of issues during the cyclone,” said an NDRF officer. Consequently, within 90 minutes of landfall, NDRF had a preliminary list of tree fall incidents, destruction of communication lines as well blocked roads, thanks to information supplied to them by locals, across a 10km radius. “This will help us during our-post cyclone interventions,” said Kumar, who kept updating journalists with news of the cyclone’s path and the infrastructural damage it was inflicting on the area.“When a cyclone makes landfall, one should remember to find the closest shelter. It has to be a concrete structure and one should not leave until the wind speed drops substantially,” said Kumar.Even before the storm had calmed, the NDRF team was loading equipment into their vehicles in preparation of their next step. “It [the cyclone] will stop at 4pm. Based on a meeting with the district collector, the process for estimating on-ground damages will begin,” said Suresh Sharma, another NDRF officer.By 6pm, 26 officers had been divided into groups of two, which fanned out across Alibag, to places that had reported tree fall and road blocks. While civilians picked up mangoes from fallen trees, the officers worked to remove branches and trunks of 44 large trees by 8pm. This was only the beginning of a long night’s work. “Our work will continue through the night. It will take three days to ensure normalcy in this district again, but we have to ensure any threat to civilians is minimised so that they are prepared for the next disaster awaiting them. After all, it hasn’t been the best year so far,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/locals-rushed-to-pick-up-mangoes-while-ndrf-team-cleared-trees/story-5rIUWsKWldn8BhAwsJhO1N.html

The city reported 1,276 new cases on Wednesday, taking the tally to 43,492. Forty-nine more deaths took the toll to 1,417. BMC officials said of the 49 deaths, 36 patients had comorbidities. Two deceased were below 40 years of age, 27 above 60, and 20 between 40 and 60 years. The civic body, in a statement, requested citizens not to ignore any fever or self-medicate, amid the Cyclone Nisarga. Citizens have been urged to keep a watch on symptoms for 7-10 days.In some administrative wards such as E (Byculla), FN (Matunga), G-South (Worli and Prabhadevi) and H-East (Santacruz East), the doubling rate has further risen to 34, 29,27 and 27 days, respectively. Both G-South and H-East wards have been Covid-19 hotspots and reported over 2,000 cases each. A higher doubling rate is good as it reflects the number of days it will take to double the case count. “We are working to increase the doubling rate in Mumbai,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani.He claimed the civic body’s stress on home quarantine, strict containment measures and contact-tracing to break the chain of transmission helped. Kakani said as many as 75-80% cases are asymptomatic or mild, while 15-18% are moderate. It is only 5-7% patients, particularly those with co-morbid conditions, who have serious illness. “While most patients with mild and moderate symptoms recover, even serious patients have gone home after beating the illness,” he said.Meanwhile, Dharavi reported 19 cases on Wednesday, pushing its tally to 1,849. A total of 3.20 lakh people from the area have been screened. India’s largest slum cluster, Dharavi houses 8.50 lakh people. Dadar reported 10 new cases, taking the total to 347. Mahim saw 25 new cases, taking the total to 574.Areas such as G-North (Dharavi, Dadar and Mahim), L (Kurla) and F-North (Matunga) topped the list of cases with 3,196, 2,773 and 2,726 cases, respectively. However, areas such as Chira Bazar (464), Borivli (486), Bhendi Bazar (560) continue to be at the bottom of the list, with the least number of cases.In terms of ward-wise growth, R-North ward (Dahisar) topped the list with 7.9%, followed by P-North ward (Malad) at 6.9% and R-South (Kandivli West) ward at 6.7%. Wards such as E (Byculla) with 1.9%, FN (Matunga) with 2.2% and G-South (Worli and Prabhadevi) with 2.3% continued to record the lowest growth.The latest infographic released by the BMC suggested of the 22,514 recovered patients, the highest number (1,504) of discharged patients were in F-North ward, followed by L ward with 1,488 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-covid-doubling-rate-up-to-19-days-from-14-bmc-data/story-ngtV3hXZgFd04Fs5fyPpAO.html

He then threatened to kill her if she informed anyone.The girl later told her family about the attack and they filed a complaint with the local police. A first information report (FIR) under section 376A (raping a mentally unsound girl) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 4 (penetrative sexual assault) and 8 (sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act was registered against the constable.

Inspector Anil Borse, in-charge of Dindori police station of Nashik Rural police, confirmed the same.“A parallel departmental enquiry was also started against the police constable. The enquiry was completed last week and it too found him guilty of all charges,” said a Mumbai Police officer requesting anonymity.The inquiry report observed that the constable’s actions maligned the police force’s image in society and hence, under relevant sections of the Mumbai Police (punishment and appeals) Act, he was dismissed from the police service on May 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/byculla-constable-sacked-from-force-for-raping-a-minor/story-SHXDMjtiD48jzo6QVkruOK.html
04-06-2020||Chandigarh||Kinnow growers worried as traders yet to approach them for crop deals||Bathinda Mohit Munjal, a kinnow grower from Fazilka district is a worried man as, so far, fruit traders have not shown any interest in striking a deal with farmers for this year’s crop. Munjal, who has an over 80-acre orchard at Khubban village near Abohar town, says as per the established past practice, kinnow farmers get paid up to 25% of the total estimated yield by May. With farmers expecting a second consecutive bumper crop this year, the coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent lockdown has them worried over sale of their crop. Kinnow harvesting starts from November and lasts till March.“Till last year, these informal trade commitments began from April onwards, after traders assessed kinnow production on the basis of fruit flowering. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, traders are out of sight and farmers are worried about the sales prospect of their crop,” Munjal adds. Punjab leads the country in the cultivation of kinnow, with the Abohar belt of Fazilka district alone contributing up to 60% to the state’s total production. The fruit is cultivated on nearly 33,000 hectares in Punjab. Last season, Abohar belt produced more than 5 lakh metric tonnes of kinnow. The mandarin fruit sown in Abohar area finds buyer in many states of the country. Orchardists like Sagar Nagpal say he had a bumper yield last season and earned well from cultivating kinnow over his 50-acre farm. “Last year, a contractor struck a deal as early as in March and I had handsome income from it. Now, when the fruit has started setting on trees and a good crop is expected, no potential wholesale buyer has visited us to date,” he adds. According to Shivam Setia, a leading fruit trader, kinnow market trade may start opening up after August. He admits the trading community is in a ‘wait-and-watch’ mode before investing in kinnow.“Traders are still unable to settle last year’s financial transactions due to the complications caused by the lockdown. The entire supply chain is in a state of financial uncertainty. I have regular supply to Bangladesh and Nepal besides Indian states.

04-06-2020||Chandigarh||Residents up in arms against containment restrictions in Chandigarh localities||Perturbed over restrictions on movement put by the Chandigarh administration in their localities, the residents of containment zones in Sector 30B and Bapu Dham Colony, Sector 26, on Wednesday held protests against the administration.To control the situation, the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) reached the spot and assured residents that the UT administration will soon hold a review meeting on the issue.The protest comes in the wake of the death of an 80-year-old woman in the containment zone of Sector 30B on Monday. The woman who tested positive posthumously had allegedly died after an ambulance failed to reach her on time. After that, MC councilor Devinder Singh Babla wrote to the UT alleging administrative lapses.A resident of Sector 30B, requesting anonymity, said, “The administration had assured us that the containment zone tag will be removed by June 4, and we had cooperated with them. We are not ready for further extension of the same.”BAPU DHAM RESIDENTS TURN AWAY RATIONMeanwhile, in pocket 15 of the Bapu Dham Colony, residents refused to take dry ration and vegetables from the administration.“For the last two days we have been protesting against the faulty testing procedures, and the holding of the whole locality under curfew when only a few houses have reported positive cases,” said a resident.The people in the pocket called off the protest only after the local administration assured them that by June 9 a decision will be taken on the issue. “We will start a hunger strike if the administration doesn’t fulfil its promise made today to exclude us from the containment zone,” said the resident.Currently, there are three containment zones in Chandigarh including certain pockets of the Bapu Dham Colony, Sector 30B and Kacchi Colony in Dhanas.A senior UT official confirmed that the administration will soon hold a meeting with the local committees of the affected areas and a final call will be taken on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/residents-of-chandigarh-s-sector-30-bapu-dham-colony-protest-against-containment-zone-tag-refuse-to-cooperate-with-admn/story-pHIxvbeGjVBPPOhvllcmAI.html
04-06-2020||Mumbai||State gets closer to 75,000 cases, records biggest one-day spike of 122 deaths||Maharashtra on Wednesday inched closer to the grim 75,000 Covid-19 cases mark with 2,560 more infections, bringing the case count to 74,860 — 36.5% of the total cases — 2,07,614 — in the country. Of them, 38,493 are active cases, according to the state health department.It has also reported 122 deaths, highest in a day so far. The toll stands at 2,587. Of them, 57 deaths are from the past two days, while the rest are between April 30 and May 31, clarified the health department.Last Friday, the state recorded 116 fatalities, which was the second-highest single-day figure so far. However, the government had clarified that 70 of them were from the previous 13 days.Of the total deaths, 49 are in Mumbai, 19 in Pune, 16 in Aurangabad, 10 in Solapur, four in Dhule , three each in Navi Mumbai, Ulhasnagar, two each in Thane, Kolhapur, Akola and one each in Mira-Bhayander, Vasai-Virar, Bhiwandi, Ahmednagar, Nandurbar, Jalna and Osmanabad. In addition, one patient each from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal died in Mumbai.Of the total deaths, 69 were above 60 years of age, while 46 were in the age group of 40 to 59 years and the remaining seven were below the age of 40 years. Of the deceased, 88 had high-risk co-morbidities, including diabetes, hypertension and heart ailments, health officials said.Statistics showed that the state has reported 1,452 deaths in the past 18 days. It comes to more than 56% of the total deaths — 2,587. It also means, on an average, 80 deaths a day.The mortality rate has also slightly increased to 3.45% (2,587 deaths on June 2) from 3.27% (1,792 deaths on May 26). It is also more than the national mortality rate, which is 2.80%, with 5,815 deaths till Tuesday, stated the data shared by the state medical education department.However, the state has also succeeded in bringing down the mortality rate significantly from last month. On April 13, the mortality rate of the state was 7.41%. (148 deaths). This indicates improvement of 4.4%, the data showed.Meanwhile, Mumbai also recorded 1,276 cases in a day. Of them, 24,597 are active cases. The city’s toll stands at 1,368.On May 22, Mumbai had reported highest one-day cases — 1,751.The challenge the state is facing is the behavioural change of the coronavirus. It has found that the virus is mutating. “We know nothing about coronavirus. All we know about it is that it is extremely infectious and spreads very fast. The virus is behaving differently and is also mutating. We have found 11 mutants of the virus recently,” said another official, wishing not to be named.Officials said that cases are likely to surge for a few more days after which they are expecting a decline in cases as the state has decided to ease restrictions in three phases. “We are concerned that with more relaxations, more people will step out and get exposed to the virus. This ultimately will result in a surge in cases. We are already experiencing a rise in cases in the districts where there were no cases or were minimal in number, before relaxations were given in the state on May 20,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity. The state health department said that the situation is improving as the compounded daily growth rate (CDGR) for Maharashtra has reduced to 4.17%, as against 7.76% on May 1. The country’s CDGR is 4.74%. The recovery rate has also improved to 43.18%, while the doubling rate has increased to 17.35 days from 9.27 days on May 1.But data shows that the state is getting more than 2,000 cases in the past 18 days (from May 17). In this period, it has also recorded over 44,323 cases. It means on an average 2,462 cases are recorded daily in the state.On May 17, there were 2,347 cases. May 18 had 2,033 new infections, May 19 saw 2,127, May 20 had 2,250, May 21 saw 2,345, May 22 had 2,940, May 23 saw 2,608, May 24 saw 3041, May 25 saw 2,436, May 26 had 2,091, May 27 saw 2,190, May 28 saw 2,598, May 29 saw 2,682, May 30 saw 2,940, May 31 had 2,487, June 1 saw 2,361 and on June 2, 2287 cases were reported.In comparison, the total number of cases registered in April was 10,201.To put the steep hike in further perspective, one should consider that the state’s first coronavirus case was reported on March 9 and it took 30 days for the figure to cross the 1,000 mark.Meanwhile, the state government is set to provide 30 monkeys to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune for clinical trials of Covid-19 vaccines. NIV has asked the state government to get them monkeys for the clinical trials. Considering the demand, the state forest minister Sanjay Rathod has issued directives to the forest department for the same. “I have directed to appoint experienced team to catch the monkeys so that they (monkeys) will not get hurt. They can be safely caught and handed over to the research institute on the conditions such as the project will not be commercialised,” the forest minister said.The health department declared to have conducted 4,97,276 tests at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra. Of them, 4,22,416 people tested negative, said an official.State currently has 3,661 active containment zones. A total of 18,950 survey teams, comprising doctors and assisting staff, have screened more than 71.48 lakh people.So far, 33,674 people have been kept in institutional quarantine in the state and over 5,71,915 people have been put under home quarantine.The state government has also constituted a committee to decide minimal rates for Covid-19 at private laboratories which is currently Rs4,500 per test. The four-member committee headed by Sudhakar Shinde, chief executive officer, State Health Assurance Society, will bargain with the laboratories to reduce the rates as testing kits are now being manufactured in the country. Earlier, the kits had to be imported from different countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-gets-closer-to-75-000-cases-records-biggest-one-day-spike-of-122-deaths/story-2bcxA67HZW9D7GewFlYFtO.html
04-06-2020||Mumbai||No trains cancelled, routes of five trains diverted due to cyclone||The Central and Western Railway have not cancelled any passenger train services on account of Cyclone Nisarga, till Wednesday evening. However, routes of five passenger trains were diverted to avoid cyclone-affected areas. The diversion was done mainly on trains on Konkan Railway line following a warning by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), as these trains were operating via Panvel, Vasai Road, Igatpuri, Nashik Road and Kalyan railway stations, all of which were affected due to the cyclone.The route diversion was done from Madgaon, Miraj, Manmad and Pune railway stations.No special arrangement was made for passengers as no changes were made in the originating and terminating railway stations of these trains. The railways said passengers were informed about the diversions by text messages. The trains that have been diverted include Ernakulam-Hazrat Nizamuddin, Thiruvananthapuram-Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT), New Delhi-Thiruvananthapuram special, Hazrat Nizamuddin-Ernakulam special and Thiruvananthapuram-New Delhi special. In addition, five passenger trains including LTT-Gorakhpur special, LTT- Thiruvananthapuram, LTT- Darbhanga, LTT- Varanasi and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT)-Bhubaneswar special train have been rescheduled for post 6pm on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a tree fall was reported on the suburban railway tracks between Kurla and Vidyavihar railway stations. The fall occurred on Wednesday afternoon due to heavy rainfall and winds owing to Cyclone Nisarga. No damage was reported to trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-trains-cancelled-routes-of-five-trains-diverted-due-to-cyclone/story-pbI8BYQthgPdDkkyWINUxN.html
04-06-2020||Mumbai||Cyclone Nisarga batters coast in Raigad; four dead, eight hurt||Nisarga, classified as a severe cyclone, killed four people and left a trail of destruction — damaged power-supply lines, roads, houses and trees — with winds gusting up to 100-110kmph across Maharashtra’s coastal districts, mainly Raigad, where it made landfall on Wednesday afternoon.A 58-year-old man died after an electric pole fell on him in Alibag and a tree crushed a 10-year-old boy in Srivardhan, while eight people were injured in Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri, state officials confirmed, as the cyclone battered not only coastal areas, but even inland tehsils. Later in the evening, officials confirmed the deaths of a 65-year-old woman and a 52-year-old man after the tin sheets over their roofs were blown in separate incidents in Pune district.Across coastal Maharashtra, including in Mumbai, 85,000 people were evacuated from their homes.Maharashtra’s seven coastal districts — Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Raigad, Thane, Mumbai City, Mumbai Suburban and Palghar district will continue to remain on alert till Thursday morning. According to a press statement issued by the state government, the cyclone is near Pune after moving on via Alibag-Mumbai-Thane and is weakening rapidly. “With further deep depression, moderate rainfall in Pune and Nashik districts is expected,” it stated.Cyclone Nisarga made landfall between Srivardhan and Murud areas, south of Alibag tehsil — around 9 nautical miles or 90 km by road from Mumbai — between 12.15pm and 12.30pm on Wednesday, said Nidhi Choudhari, district collector, Raigad, after assessing the preliminary extent of damage with the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) on Wednesday evening. The high intensity of the cyclone was felt most for three hours between 12.30pm and 3.30pm, although it completed landfall within two hours (12.30pm to 2.30 pm). While the India Meteorological Department (IMD) rain data for Alibag between 8.30am and 3.30pm was 51.2 mm, the district administration ‘s data showed 84.3mm rain between 8.30am and 5.30 pm for Alibag, while Ratnagiri, south of the landfall site, recorded 45mm during the same period.Besides the evacuation of 50,000 people in Mumbai and Mumbai Suburban districts, 34,933 were relocated in the five remaining districts — 15,080 in Palghar; 13, 245 in Raigad; 1,387 in Thane; 5,156 in Ratnagiri and 65 in Sindhudurg . Private met forecaster Skymet Weather said it was a close shave for Mumbai. “Our observation is that the impact on Mumbai was less because the landfall location was shifted somewhat south of Alibag. There was only light to moderate rains in Mumbai during and immediately after landfall,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate and meteorology at Skymet Weather.The Raigad district administration estimated at least 10,000 tree-fall incidents across affected areas. Power utilities were shut down through most of the district, while structures with tin roofs blown away by high-speed winds were a common sight across all affected areas. Chaudhari said 58-year old Dasharath Waghmare died after an electric pole fell on him at Umte village in Alibag, while a 10-year boy died after a tree fell on him. Uday Samant, guardian minister, Ratnagiri, said: “Four people, including a woman, were injured in two villages in Ratnagiri district. There are reports of huge damages to houses and structures in a few tehsils, including Mandangad and Dapoli, due to the gusty winds. I have asked the district collector to assess the losses in the next two days and compensate them accordingly,” he said.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and his deputy Ajit Pawar reviewed the situation in the morning with district collectors and the divisional commissioner. Thackeray directed the administration to launch rescue operations and survey the losses. Thackeray later thanked the people of Maharashtra and the state authorities in unitedly facing the crisis. “Even as Maharashtra is battling the Covid-19 crisis, the cyclone stormed its coastal part. The state stood unitedly and successfully to face this challenge. I am sure this unity will help us tide over the Covid-19 crisis too,” he said. Kishorraje Nimbalkar, secretary, relief and rehabilitation, said, “The alert will stay. There has been considerable damage to properties in Raigad district, compared to the other districts.” “The entire district is cyclone hit as it struck us exactly at Diveagar, and later moved towards Alibag and Pen tehsils. The impact was felt as far as Margaon, Khopoli and Karjat (inland tehsils) where tree and electric lines were badly damaged,” said Chaudhari. “Estimated number of tree falls across Raigad is currently over 10,000 trees as per our preliminary assessment, with Roha, Revdanda and Srivardhan being worst affected. Around 15 trees were badly damaged at my office and residence.”The IMD said the maximum wind speed when the severe cyclone made landfall was 100-120 kmph along the district. Mrutunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD, said Raigad was the worst-affected district with maximum impact. “Alibag witnessed 100kmph, while Mumbai (Colaba) and Ratnagiri reported 72kmph and 65kmph,” he said. Mohapatra added that storm surge was also highest for Raigad district with levels ranging between 1.8m to 2m. Maximum storm surge was seen at Alibag and Murud in terms of storm surge and wind speed. Areas like Mumbai, Thane, Ratnagiri and Palghar witnessed storm surge of 0.8 to 1m.“The severe cyclone has weakened into a cyclonic storm and is expected to further decrease into a deep depression by Wednesday night as it moves its course towards north Maharashtra,” said Mohapatra. “This is the first time in history that IMD had issued a cyclone watch for Maharashtra and Gujarat after a low pressure area had formed in the Arabian Sea as early as March 31. This is not done usually throughout the globe, but we gave both governments enough time to take up management,” added Mohapatra.Meanwhile, NDRF officials said every one kilometre distance in Alibag witnessed two cases of tree fall. “Not only in Alibag, but a similar assessment is being seen across all affected coastal districts. We have identified exact locations where fallen trees are being removed and roads are being connected again. A similar exercise is being done for electric poles. However, the entire restoration process will take at least three days,” said Mahesh Kumar, inspector (in-charge of Alibag), NDRF.While NDRF teams began efforts to remove tree branches and barks fallen on major roads across affected tehsils, district officials were directed to finalise further reports of devastation witnessed in Raigad by the end of the day, and simultaneously tend to damaged infrastructure such as roads and communication lines. “Our appeal to all citizens is that they must not venture out even if the wind speed and rains have calmed. They must not leave their homes, while we carry out rescue relief operations through the night so that there is no loss of human life,” said Choudhari.Raigad district information officer Manoj Sanap said, “We have already cleared fallen trees and power lines along major highways such as Alibag-Pen, Alibag-Revas, Goa Highway up to Sukeli, and Murud to Majgaon.” Mobile services were affected in many tehsils in the coastal districts. Tidal waves measuring up to 6-8 feet lashed parts of coastal areas in Ratnagiri and Raigad districts. Tin roofs of the houses and erected on the terraces of residential, commercial structures flew away in some places in Raigad, Ratnagiri and Palghar districts. Power supply was severely affected in parts of Maharashtra owing to the collapse of electric poles and damage of power lines. According to the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), 2,68,000 consumers were affected owing to power cuts in eight different talukas. However, Mumbai largely remained unaffected. MSEDCL is yet to estimate its losses, but officials said that it is expected to be a huge financial burden. District officials in Palghar, Ratnagiri and Thane also ordered forced shutdown of transformers to prevent mishaps.NDRF Maharashtra commandant Anupam Srivastava said that no major flooding was reported in the coastal districts. Owing to gusty winds, lot of trees got uprooted due to which roads were blocked in and around some areas of Alibag. “Houses with tin and thatched roofs suffered major damage,” he said. As of Wednesday, he said NDRF will be stationed in Raigad for five days, but will be relieved from other districts in the next two-three days. A total of 20 teams have been stationed across the seven districts since Tuesday. In view of the extensive damage caused in Raigad, two more teams of NDRF will be deployed in the district. One team each from Mumbai and Thane will be shifted to Raigad for relief measures, said Sachidanand Gawde, second in-command, NDRF, Pune. Food and civil supply minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who is also guardian minister of Nashik, took review of the preparations in district and in North Maharashtra. He directed the administration for the timely evacuation of the people to avoid any losses. Nisarga’s eye (region of calm at the centre of a cyclonic storm) was about 80km in diameter and the size of the cyclone was about 500km as captured by radar, encompassing neighbouring Mumbai and Thane districts, according to IMD.“The cyclone track has been the same as forecast by us. It made landfall south of Alibag. The cyclone’s eye diameter was 80 km—centre of the eye crossed south of Alibag in Raigad but rest of eye crossed neighbouring districts. Of course it passed over Mumbai. We never said that Nisarga will hit Mumbai directly, but Mumbai has been impacted by the severe cyclone,” said M Mohapatra.A ship carrying diesel was stranded near Mirya port in Ratnagiri. “The ship was anchored near Pandhara Samudra, when it received the cyclone alert two days ago. It was stranded as the anchor rope detached and later drifted to the shore because of formation of a huge wave. Thirteen sailors, including three foreigners, have been rescued safely. They will be tested for Covid-19 and quarantined for 14 days. The ship is damaged and expected to remain anchored for at least one month,” Samant said. Ahead of Wednesday’s landfall, a total of 4,407 people had been relocated from the coastal resort town of Alibag.However, a survey of coastal villages by HT’s reporter showed that many people had still not left their homes despite a warning by district authorities. HT spoke to residents of three fishing villages, Siddharth Nagar, Shastri Nagar and Alibag Koliwada, who were still at home on Wednesday morning. Local police was spotted going door-to-door, telling people to evacuate as rain and wind speed intensified marginally around 9.30 am.Meanwhile, Sunita Devi, in-charge of cyclones at IMD, said, “Unlike Amphan this cyclone didn’t intensify rapidly, while in the ocean, but intensified very quickly when it was only 250 km from the Maharashtra coast as winds picked by 20 to 40kmph early morning on Wednesday and made landfall as a severe cyclonic storm”.“Intensification from a tropical cyclone to a category 1 cyclone in case of Nisarga happened in about 12 hours near the coast,” said Mathew Roxy Koll, climate scientist at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. His team said that this was the first time after 1998 that a severe cyclonic storm crossed the west coast. The 1998 cyclone had made landfall in Gujarat’s Kandla and killed thousands of people, but didn’t impact Mumbai.It is very unusual for a cyclone to make landfall in or near Mumbai or even on the Maharashtra coast. The storms that form during monsoon onset over Arabian Sea usually move towards Oman. Cyclone Phyan, of a much lower intensity had last impacted these districts in 2009 and even Mumbai had recorded extremely heavy rains. The upper level winds steered Nisarga towards Maharashtra coast.According to IMD, landfall is the event of a tropical cyclone coming onto land after being over water.

04-06-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 patients with suspected TB are at a higher risk, say doctors||The city’s biggest municipal tuberculosis (TB) facility, Group of Tuberculosis Hospitals, Sewree, has reported 23 Covid-19 cases among suspected TB patients in the last month, with four deaths. For doctors at the hospital, the growing number of such cases has become a cause for worry.Due to their compromised lung condition, TB patients are most vulnerable to Covid-19. But considering the similarities between the two diseases, it is extremely challenging to differentiate between the two. Despite being at higher risk of infection, as HT reported on April 20, treatment of TB patients has taken a back seat due to the pandemic.In the last one month, the Sewri TB hospital has received 23 Covid positive patients with suspected TB. Of these, four, all of whom had previously recovered from TB, succumbed to the infection. An 18-year-old Covid-19 positive woman was the youngest to die at the hospital last week.“As Covid-19 mainly affects the lungs and airways, patients with pulmonary TB are most susceptible to the infection. Their X-rays also show similar clouding and it is extremely difficult to identify the differences,” said Dr Lalit Anande, medical superintendent of the hospital.All four Covid victims had a medical history of TB. “Though all four had recovered, their lungs were still weak and their immunity was low. Thus, they contracted the infection easily. The condition of these patients deteriorates fast, especially if they develop pneumonia. We get just a few hours for their treatment before they collapse,” said Dr Anande.The hospital has created a Covid isolation ward for suspected TB patients. Since the outbreak, the ward has treated 67 patients and 10 of them have been discharged. One 52-year-old TB patient who was on the BEAT (Building Evidence for Advance Treatment against Tuberculosis) clinical trial has also recovered from Covid-19.According to doctors at the TB hospital, vitamin C immunisers have provided new hope for patients. Most of these dosages were donated by Bollywood actor Salman Khan a few months ago, prior to the Covid-19 outbreak.“It acts as an antioxidant and builds immunity among patients. It has helped patients with pneumonia. It is not scientifically proven but we have seen huge improvement among patients,” said Anande. “We need to do more research on vitamin C and include it in the treatment of Covid patients,” she added.Aside from the 23 cases among suspected TB patients, 44 medical staffers have also contracted Covid-19 through cross-transmission. One of the staffers, a class IV employee, succumbed to the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-patients-with-suspected-tb-are-at-a-higher-risk-say-doctors/story-0Co31OKM91RWtw2BH8OdKN.html
04-06-2020||City||Thane records 25.59mm rainfall due to Cyclone Nisarga||The Thane Municipal Corporation recorded 25.59mm rainfall as Cyclone Nisarga passed over the district. There were no casualties, but waterlogging was reported in some areas near Bhiwandi-Kalyan road and as a preventive measure, there was forced loadshedding in parts of Thane district. Overall, 46 cases of tree fall were reported across Thane city, in places like Charai, Kalwa, Kopri, Khopat. In rural areas within Thane district, 14 incidents of tree fall were reported. Ambernath had 12 incidents of tree fall. There were also two incidents of metal sheets — used as roof over houses — flying off because of strong winds.“As a precautionary measure, we had asked for forced loadshedding within Thane district. There were no casualties. Only a few incidents of treefall, which were handled by local authorities,” said a senior official from Thane District collectorate.Waterlogging was reported from areas near Bhiwandi-Kalyan road. “Buildings in low-lying areas experienced waterlogging on Wednesday afternoon. Some nullahs in the vicinity also started overflowing. Water also entered the ground floor of some buildings,” said Taj Khan, 34, a resident of Bhiwandi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-records-25-59mm-rainfall-due-to-cyclone-nisarga/story-fozva6MK9UkEWvpZIVCaJP.html
04-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai airport shuts down flight ops for over 4 hours||Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) had to close its flight operations for three-and-a-half hours on Wednesday due to adverse wind patterns caused by Cyclone Nisarga.According to airport operator Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL), CSMIA handled six arrivals and 24 departures in total (including commercial, repatriation and Vande Bharat flights) on Wednesday before closing operations in the afternoon. Due to the cyclone, the airport was scheduled to handle only 20 commercial flights (eight arrivals and 12 departures) throughout the day. It has been handling 50 flights — 25 departures and arrivals each — daily since flight operations resumed on May 25, as opposed to nearly 950 daily flights before the lockdown was imposed. IndiGo and Vistara cancelled majority of their flights operating to and from Mumbai due to the weather warning. A spokesperson from MIAL said, “CSMIA saw a total of 20 scheduled flights which include 12 departures and 8 arrivals. CSMIA connected to 12 sectors which were operated by five airlines —Air India, AirAsia India, IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir.”“In consultation with AAI (Airports Authority of India), considering the strong crosswinds, it has been decided that no arrivals and departures will take place between 14:30-19:00 hours,” read the MIAL statement. Flight operations, however, resumed at 6pm. In the afternoon, an Ethiopian Airlines flight from Riyadh to Mumbai had to be diverted to Ahmedabad and two Emirates cargo flights returned to Dubai due to poor weather conditions. Similarly, a Jaipur-Pune flight was diverted to Surat. Meanwhile, a FedEx (cargo) flight from Bengaluru to Mumbai overshot the runway at CSMIA around 12pm. A senior airport official said, “Secondary runway was in use from midnight due to wind pattern hence the aircraft landed on runway 14. No injuries or damage to the aircraft was caused in the overshooting of aircraft. It was a minor incident as the aircraft remained in the paved area or the runway-end surface area and no operations were affected.” A MIAL spokesperson said the FedEx flight 5033, an MD11 aircraft, was towed away from the runway and there were no disruption in flight operations.Flight operations at Juhu airport was closed from 12pm which would continue till 8am on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-airport-shuts-down-flight-ops-for-over-4-hours/story-Pq035hJbQhe5TFRpXIvVCN.html
04-06-2020||Mumbai||BKC’s Covid-19 facility suffers rain damage; Opposition seeks cost report||While the city escaped a major threat from Cyclone Nisarga, the makeshift Covid-19 hospital at the Bandra-Kurla Complex, constructed by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) reportedly suffered damages due to the strong winds coupled with heavy rain on Wednesday.As many as 200 patients were shifted from this Covid-19 hospital to the treatment centre at NSCI Exhibition Centre in Worli and Sion hospital, on Tuesday, a day before the cyclone was expected to make landfall. “We inspected the facility site and only the outer compound wall, made of makeshift material, came off. There was no damage to the interior of the facility,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner.Several videos of the damage caused to the BKC facility were shared on social media on Wednesday, which showed the grounds flooded. MMRDA had constructed the makeshift hospital in 10 days at the MMRDA grounds in BKC for treatment of Covid-19 patients and had handed over the site to the BMC last month.“Admission of patients to the BKC facility can be restarted from Thursday evening. We are also planning another facility which is near the first one. This will also be a 1,000-bedded facility.”On Tuesday, MMRDA tweeted, “After #CycloneNisarg, work restarts for second Covid facility at BKC. Nothing happened to Covid hospital 1 and 2 during Cyclone though as a matter of abundant precaution, patients were shifted.”Opposition leaders are now slamming the authorities over the decision to build the makeshift hospital on open ground.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Ameet Satam has written to MMRDA commissioner RA Rajeev, seeking all details of the makeshift structure. “There are several irregularities in this makeshift hospital which the authority is trying to hide,” she wrote. “We have been told that a whopping ₹ 8,000 was spent per square foot to construct this facility. I would request you to give me details of the item-wise cost involved in making the facility and also the details of the contractor who made this facility,” the letter said.On June 2, Kirit Somaiya, former BJP MP, tweeted, “I am upset, yet monsoon to start, BKC corona center just started & now with the worry of monsoon, government compelled to shift all patients of BKC to other places !!!!...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bkc-s-covid-19-facility-suffers-rain-damage-opposition-seeks-cost-report/story-QsQMdAP35Eyh18GJRRRkaI.html
04-06-2020||Mumbai||SoBo sees heavy rain, suburbs moderate; IMD may lift alert||As Cyclone Nisarga made landfall between Srivardhan and Murud in Raigad district on Wednesday afternoon, it brought rain and wind to Mumbai. Colaba recorded wind speed of 74 kilometres per hour (kmph) and heavy rain. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said it may remove the orange alert (for heavy rain warning) for the city on Thursday. IMD has forecast light and moderate rain for Thursday, with a maximum temperature of 26 degrees Celsius and minimum temperature of 23 degrees Celsius.On Wednesday, IMD recorded “rather heavy” rain (48.9mm) in south Mumbai between 8.30am and 8.30pm, while the suburbs witnessed moderate rainfall (23.6mm). The same trend was seen between 8.30am on Tuesday to 8.30am on Wednesday, with Colaba and Santacruz weather stations recording 45.2mm and 23.4mm rainfall respectively. “Since the path of the cyclone was close to south Mumbai, it rained more in that part of the city compared to the suburbs,” said Nitha Sasidharan, scientist at IMD Mumbai.Mahesh Palawat, vice president (climate and meteorology) at private weather forecast agency Skymet Weather, said, “The cyclone was anticipated to reach north of Mumbai two days ago, but changed track to south of Mumbai. As a result, the intensity of rain was witnessed in the southern part of Mumbai.” He said isolated showers were forecast for Friday, followed by clear skies afterwards.As per IMD’s bulletins, the severe cyclonic storm had weakened into a cyclonic storm and lay centred over interior Maharashtra on Wednesday evening. It had moved northeast-wards at 22kmph and weakened into a deep depression over north Madhya Maharashtra, which is approximately 100 kilometres from Mumbai. At 7.30pm, wind intensity was 55-65kmph, gusting at 75kmph. According to IMD, the deep depression will move northeast-wards and further weaken into a depression over the next 12 hours. Wind forecast for this period of time in coastal Maharashtra and Gujarat is 55-65kmph, gusting at 75kmph. After 12 hours, wind speed is expected to reduce to 40-50kmph, gusting at 60kmph. “As the cyclone trajectory moved in the interiors of Maharashtra, it weakened and ended up in a depression. So while rains will continue because of the cyclonic weather system, the intensity of the winds will reduce,” said Sasidharan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sobo-sees-heavy-rain-suburbs-moderate-imd-may-lift-alert/story-9RwNDNF0tbRkvgy8mMXnTN.html

04-06-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19: Gurugram lifts border curbs, but Capital remains off-bounds||The Gurugram police on Wednesday removed barricades at 11 border crossing points to the national capital and said commuters can now travel between the two cities without any restrictions, days after the Haryana government restricted cross-border travel citing rising Covid-19 cases.Deputy commissioner Amit Khatri issued an order late on Tuesday directing the withdrawal of the restrictions “in view of MHA [ministry of home affairs] guidelines on reopening and unrestricted movement of persons and goods.”The ministry on Saturday released details of the first of a three-phase plan--Unlock 1.0--for lifting stringent restrictions imposed over two months back to stop the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. The plan removed restrictions on inter- and intra-state travel.But even as the Gurugram police cleared the barricades and de-sealed the Delhi border on their side, Delhi Police officers said their personnel deployed at the borders with Gurugram continued checking motorists for movement passes before letting them in. Checks, however, were conducted only intermittently to avoid snarls and to prevent commuters from being inconvenienced, officers said.“Those who did not have movement passes were stopped from entering Delhi. All essential service providers and government employees were let in after seeing their ID cards or movement passes,” said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur. The Gurugram police checked movement passes until 9.30 am on Wednesday, which led to congestion for nearly 20 minutes before they received orders to remove the barricades.Gurugram police commissioner Muhammad Akil said the deployment of police personnel will continue at the border crossing points to control the traffic movement and congestion.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday said the restrictions should be lifted in accordance with MHA guidelines. But after the Delhi government announced on Monday that the Capital’s borders will be sealed for a week, the Gurugram administration on Tuesday said one of the crossing points will remain regulated as per previous orders. It said only pass-holders would be allowed to commute. Later on Tuesday evening, Khatri issued his order. Rohit Agarwal, a software engineer, said he left his home in Delhi on Wednesday and planned to stay in Gurugram for a week. He added he was surprised to find no checking at the border. “The government agencies are confused. Every day they come up with a new plan. It is high time that commuters should be given some clarity on the movement so that we can arrange accordingly.”Another commuter said even police are confused and said they are unaware of any fresh orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/ggm-lifts-border-curbs-but-capital-remains-off-bounds/story-JbyRfayDpnTMvCsukAwVKP.html

Gurdeep Singh, 52, was on duty near the canal bridge in Doraha, when he received an alert that a man in his mid 20s had jumped into the canal. He rushed to the spot and rescued the man with the help of divers. The man was then taken to a private hospital for treatment.ASI Gurdeep Singh is known to have saved nine others from drowning earlier for which he has received awards from the director general of police.In July 2017, he had rescued three people from drowning in two separate cases. “I constantly patrol alongside the railway crossing to manage traffic, as traffic jams are likely when the railway crossing is closed. While patrolling, I keep an eye on the canal to see if anyone needs help,” the ASI said.“I have formed a team of local divers. We have arranged ropes and tubes for rescuing those who are drowning. After administrating first-aid, we rush them to nearby hospitals,” he added.Gurdeep Singh joined the police in 1989 as constable. He was promoted to ASI in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/policeman-saves-man-from-drowning-in-ludhiana/story-VDz95AZqmjA1YzFcHA05HI.html

04-06-2020||City||No expertise, funds to run Covid centre: Thane housing body||A day after the municipal corporation asked housing societies to set up isolation centres in their premises, the Thane District Cooperative Housing Federation said that it is not feasible.The Thane civic commissioner has asked housing societies to set up Covid care centres in clubhouses and multipurpose halls to isolate asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms. The federation has written to the civic commissioner, saying that club house or halls do not have manpower and equipment for a Covid care centre. The federation said that while housing societies are willing to give space for the centre, they cannot operate it.Sitaram Rane, president of the federation, said, “Housing societies are ready to give clubhouses for a Covid centre. But, they cannot operate it or meet the standard set by the TMC for the centres. The directives have asked societies to hire expert doctors and also pay them. Most societies cannot afford this. The directives also say societies should arrange for oxygen cylinders. If a patient becomes critical, who will be responsible?”He said TMC also wants housing societies to ensure the waste generated at the centre be given to bio-waste treatment centres. Housing societies have no experience in handling bio-waste.“It is unfair to give such a huge and costly responsibility to the residential societies,” said Rane.Some housing societies are willing to implement the directives but with proper guidance.Madhu Menon, member of Hiranandani Estates Residents Welfare Association (HERWA), said, “Residents will be safe and comfortable here than in a stadium or community centre. We have space in the club house and can turn it to a Covid care centre.”Kasber Augustine, founder of Thane Citizen’s Forum, which includes many housing societies, said proper training and guidance should be given to the society members. “We do not have expertise for Covid centres. Residents need to be trained in handling such a centre instead of merely asking the directives to be followed,” said Augustine.The Thane Municipal Corporation said proper guidelines will be issues to housing societies which approach them. A civic official requesting anonymity said, “The housing societies can approach us and we will help them set up the centre and also guide them. With Covid cases increasing, such centres need to be set up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-expertise-funds-to-run-covid-centre-thane-housing-body/story-xtvbazErM7pVYLQoyPds6H.html

04-06-2020||Delhi||Covid norms to shape Delhi’s next Master Plan||Covid-19 norms, including social distancing and better preparedness to tackle pandemics, will be among the key focus areas of the Capital’s next master plan (Master Plan of Delhi-2041) — a blueprint for city’s urban development — prepared by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), according to two people familiar with the matter.DDA has asked the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), which has been tasked to draft MPD-2041, to incorporate post-Covid norms while planning for housing, mobility and public spaces in the next master plan. It has also asked NIUA to factor in pandemics and new kind of threats while reworking the city’s disaster management strategy, the people said.A meeting in this regard was held a few days ago between DDA and NIUA officials, said a senior DDA official involved in the master plan preparation who asked not to be named. “The issues that were discussed included incorporating Covid norms in future planning,” he said.Until last year, air pollution topped the focus areas for MPD-2041. However, after the breakout of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), DDA officials said the current challenge also has to be considered while making the master plan. “The Covid-19 pandemic has changed the way we live; social distancing and protective gear are the new normal now. Now we will have to rethink about the future development in Delhi keeping in mind the post-Covid norms and the emerging situation,” said the DDA official cited above.Delhi reported 1,513 infections on Wednesday -- the maximum in a day so far -- with the total cases reaching 23,645. With nine more succumbing to the disease in the past 24 hours, the toll was 606, according to the Delhi government’s bulletin.  NIUA, which has to submit the draft of MPD-2041 by December, is currently in the process to finalise the chapters of MPD-2041, which will govern city’s urban planning for the next two decades. “DDA has asked us to review the MPD-2041 preparation incorporating lessons emerging from Covid-19 situation. We have to take into account post-Covid social norms in public spaces, mobility, workplaces and housing while laying out guidelines for city planning,” NIUA director Hitesh Vaidya said.Urban development experts say that housing, commercial spaces, environment, transport or mobility, disaster management, including pandemics, are some of key areas that need to be re-examined in view of the new challenges posed by the Covid pandemic.The Covid-19 pandemic has put the spotlight on disaster management strategy in the master plan, which was largely about earthquakes and floods so far. “Based on the learnings from Covid-19, we should also look into disaster management strategy for Delhi and include this new threat. Till now, the focus has been only on flood and earthquakes,” Vaidya said. In the past two decades, Delhi has witnessed outbreaks of diseases such as dengue, H1N1 (another pandemic in 2010) and now Covid-19. However, the current master plan is silent on pandemics. With Sars-CoV-2 virus bringing parts of the world to a halt, experts say the master plan of big cities should have a chapter on pandemic resilience.“Every city should have a plan to deal with pandemics, we can’t be caught unawares. The master plan should also focus on benchmarking health infrastructure,” said R Srinivas, senior town and country planner, Town and Country Planning Organisation -- an urban planning body under the ministry of housing and urban affairs. Health care infrastructure has to be an integral part of planning, said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, adding that Delhi doesn’t have good secondary level health facilities. “There are dispensaries and then tertiary care centres. There has to be a secondary level of health care facilities that can take the load off tertiary centres. Currently, there is uneven distribution of hospitals. Areas such as Dwarka and Najafgarh don’t have a single big government hospital whereas there are two tertiary care centres in South Delhi—Safdarjung and AIIMS. Similarly, Lok Nayak and GB Pant hospitals are located in close vicinity in central Delhi. The master plan should focus on even distribution of healthcare centres,” said Dr Kishore.Urban planning experts also said that housing, especially for poor, public spaces, and mobility are some of the areas, which will have to be re-imagined while factoring in the realities of the post-Covid world.Slums clusters and densely populated residential neighbourhoods have emerged as hot spots for Covid-19 in the city. At a time when the Centre and the state governments focus on housing for all, they point out that there is also the need to review housing for poor. “While planning for housing, we will have to ensure density management so that it doesn’t lead to crowding, as social distancing has become essential now,” Srinivas said. AK Jain, a former planning commissioner at DDA, said it is also time to focus on Transit Oriented Development (TOD), which is mentioned in the MPD-2021 but hasn’t been implemented, and to increase mixed land use developments. “Work from home has to be encouraged, especially now. There is a need to push for mixed land use developments were 50% of the space is reserved for commercial activity. The main focus of the MPD should be to ensure that a sizeable population can walk or cycle to work. Focus should be on planned densification,” said Jain. Anuj Malhotra, mobility expert and knowledge partner to the high-powered committee of the Union ministry of home affairs, said TOD has become extremely relevant in the post-Covid scenario because it addresses both mobility and housing concerns. “Planned mixed-use development near Metro stations will automatically reduce the number of trips or the need for travel, since it will bring residential and commercial developments in close proximity…TOD is the way forward,” said Malhotra.DDA officials agreed that fixing mobility would be a challenge. The restriction on the number of passengers in buses and other public transport modes to ensure social distancing, transport experts say, provides an excellent opportunity to address the problem of crowding in public transport in one stroke.“Though these are testing times, it is an opportunity to address the issue of crowding in public transport—one of the main reasons why people avoid using it…. We should ensure that the travelling in public transport remain convenient even after things return to normal. This can be done by prioritising public transport lane so that buses can cover more kilometers. Also infrastructure should be built in such a manner that it takes load off public transport by making it easier and safer to cycle or walk,,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, transport at the Centre for Science and Environment. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Dr Randeep Guleria said, “The impact pandemics can have on economy and livelihood has become more evident now. Healthcare infrastructure has to be integrated with city planning for better and effective management during pandemics. There is a need to have dedicated setup for outbreak management centres in cities which in normal times can work as regular hospitals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-norms-to-shape-delhi-s-next-master-plan/story-tnXtX2PBuYzPxW3JPEzmqJ.html
04-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt forms second Covid-19 advisory body||The Delhi government has constituted a second five-member expert committee to evaluate its preparedness to handle an increase in Covid-19 cases, and suggest measures to augment health infrastructure in the city.The committee is headed by Dr Mahesh Verma who is the vice-chancellor of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University and former director of Maulana Azad Institute of Dental Sciences. The panel includes Dr Sunil Kumar, medical director of Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, Dr Arun Gupta, president of the Delhi Medical Council, Dr RK Gupta, former president of the Delhi Medical Association, and Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director of Max hospital.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageA senior government official confirmed that the first committee, formed on March 27 and headed by Dr SK Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, continues to function. The two panels will execute separate mandates, the official said.The June 2 order, signed by special health secretary SM Ali, constituting the second committee reads that the panel has to submit a report of its recommendations by Saturday (June 6).“We received the orders on Wednesday itself, and the committee has been called to meet on Thursday,” said Dr Arun Gupta.The formation of the new panel comes at a crucial time when the Delhi government is deliberating if health services in the city should be limited to its residents, and if the city’s borders should remain shut — an issue the committee will also consider. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday asked residents of the Capital to weigh in on these matters, and the government will decide on the course of action by next week.In the meantime, Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh remain shut.“The moment we open the borders, people from across the country will come to Delhi for treatment. There are about 9,500 beds for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in Delhi; currently, there are only 2,300 patients. The beds will fill up in just two days if patients from across the country come for treatment to Delhi. Should we open the borders? Some say, borders should be opened but the hospitals services should be reserved for those living in Delhi till Covid-19 pandemic,” Kejriwal had said in a press briefing on Monday.“We have been given the mandate to evaluate the available health infrastructure, and suggest what the government should do next. This will include the question of whether or not to restrict Delhi hospitals services to the city’s residents. It is not ethical to deny health services to anyone when beds are vacant. But when they are full and it comes to choosing who gets a bed, how do we decide? The committee’s members will look at what can be done,” said Dr Mahesh Verma.Delhi has been recording around 1,000 cases of Covid-19 everyday for almost a week now. This is the third scenario for which preparedness measures had been suggested by a committee the government had constituted earlier.The Delhi government is in the process of ramping up its bed capacity to around 9,800 by mid-June as per the recommendations of the first committee.The previous committee had been set up in March-end and asked the government to prepare for three scenarios —100 cases a day, 500 cases a day, and 1,000 cases a day. “Delhi can expect to start recording around 2,000 cases a day by next week,” said an expert following the trends, on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-forms-second-covid-19-advisory-body/story-Dcmmzv44LEKfAXNsMaSIdK.html
04-06-2020||Noida||Greater Noida: Stray dog found dead with injuries after woman attacked for feeding it; FIR lodged||Calling out animal cruelty, animal activists registered an FIR and an investigation after a stray dog was found dead in a Greater Noida high rise with multiple injuries.Police said the blood-soaked body of the dog was found on Sunday, about 10 days after a Chinese national, who used to feed the dog, was attacked allegedly by a resident of the same society for feeding the stray, in ATS Green Paradiso, Greater Noida. The incident took place on May 25, when the Chinese national, who works at an electronic company, was allegedly beaten by Amar Pal Singh (60) with a heavy wooden stick while on a morning walk, because she used to feed a community stray dog that had a fight with the pet of the accused. The accused was arrested and his bail was denied and he was later sent to jail on May 30.While Singh awaits trial at the district court, some locals, who did not wish to be named, later stated that anger against stray dogs, which had been brewing among residents for some time, mounted after Singh’s arrest as many residents are against the presence of strays living the highrise. Following the incident, the animal welfare organisation Peoples for Animal (PFA) submitted a police complaint at the Beta 2 police station, Kasna, Greater Noida on Wednesday. The dog was dead on the main road near the high rise on May 31.“We have started investigation, and an FIR was registered against unknown persons on Tuesday. The body of the dog was found outside the high rise. We are looking into the matter to ascertain if the dog was killed in an accident or was beaten to death,” said Sujeet Upadhyay, station house officer, Beta 2 Police station. He added that the FIR was lodged under sections 429 (Mischief by killing or maiming cattle, etc., of any value or any animal of the value of Rs 50) and 120 B (Punishment for criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 11 of The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.The doctor who examined the body of the dog said there were injuries and the report was submitted to the police.“I cannot recall exactly where and how many but there were fractures in the left leg. I submitted the report to the police on Tuesday,” said Dr Karan Patel, a veterinary doctor at the Government Veterinary Hospital in Devla, Greater Noida.Activists at PFA said the canine had suffered multiple injuries.“This is a case of animal cruelty. The medical report showed that the dog received multiple injuries due to blunt force trauma. There were multiple fractures and the body was soaked in blood, dumped outside the high rise. We are sharing several pieces of evidence with the police, including messages which were circulated on the high rise’s WhatsApp groups, claiming that they are throwing the stray out and about only how many strays are still left inside which they are working to “manage” soon. There are witnesses saying that the dog was locked inside a room of the society and the next day it was found dead,” alleged Kaveri Rana, president, PFA, Gautam Budh Nagar.The apartment owners association (AOA), meanwhile, claimed that the dog was killed in a road accident, stating that they have substantial proof to support the claim. They added that the society has a policy of no strays and had been asking residents to feed strays outside the society, near a green area.“The stay in question died on the main Kasna-Agra road after meeting with an accident and we have substantial proof. There is also CCTV footage where the dog can be seen running on the road located right after the greenbelt outside our society. We had also apprised the police about the same,” said Sombir Singh, AOA secretary, ATS Green Paradiso.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-stray-dog-found-dead-with-injuries-after-woman-attacked-for-feeding-it-fir-lodged/story-7sODYKrrl4qdDx6GIz3RWJ.html
04-06-2020||Delhi||IGI stadium, Siri Fort sports complex may be turned into extended Covid hospitals||With 1,095 new coronavirus cases being reported daily on an average in the past week, the Delhi government on Wednesday identified Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium, Siri Fort Sports Complex, the Saket Sports Complex, a private hospital, three hotels and two banquet halls among facilities that can be used as extended Covid-19 hospitals or dedicated care facilities, if the need arises.The government also identified at least 13 additional cremation facilities and four burial grounds for Covid deaths (both confirmed and suspected), showed documents accessed by HT.The national capital on Wednesday reported 1,513 new cases -- the maximum in a day so far -- and nine deaths. The pathogen has so far infected 23,645 in Delhi and killed 606 people, as per Delhi government’s daily bulletin. Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageOn Monday, as the government announced a series of measures aimed at reviving business and commerce activities and public transport in the city, it also had issued an order directing district magistrates in all 11 revenue districts of the city to identify suitable accommodation for new patients and land for adding capacity to dispose of bodies at a reasonable distance from residential areas, latest by Wednesday.These directions are part of the government’s augmentation plan that aimed at augmentation of bed capacity in hospitals and space required for burial and cremation.On Wednesday, a senior government official told HT that seven out of 11 districts in the city sought more time for the exercise, with most of them citing space constraints.While two of them – South and South-West districts– could identify additional space for burial or cremation, three – South, West and Central districts -- identified potential Covid healthcare facilities and sent preliminary reports to the Delhi Disaster Management Authority.Other than the three sports facilities, the hotels and banquet halls identified by the department are located in neighbourhoods that include Chhatarpur, Bhatti Road and Hari Nagar. The private hospital is located in south Delhi’s Madangir, the documents showed. As per the documents, the cremation and burial grounds have been identified in areas that include Aya Nagar, Sultanpur, Chhatarpur, Lado Sarai, Asola and Dwarka.Shashi Kaushal, District Magistrate (north-east), said that there is no additional space in the district where bed augmentation can be planned. “We are short of space to arrange additional beds. However, we are exploring locations for additional graveyards,” Kaushal said.According to data compiled by the Census and the Delhi government, the north-east district comprises only 4% of Delhi’s land area but it is inhabited by more than 13% of the city’s population.The neighbouring districts of Shahdara and East Delhi are equally congested.“We don’t have large empty spaces where such facilities could be developed. There are small community halls where only 20-25 beds can be arranged, which serves no purpose. However, for burial grounds, we are searching for some empty land near Mandoli Jail but till now we have not identified any site,” said Sanjeev Kumar, district magistrate (Shahdara).These districts have a few banquet halls and air-conditioned multipurpose halls but there are issues too, an official in the district administration.“While some of them are not adequately separated by a populous area, the owners of some others are not ready to allow their properties being used for the purpose. We are trying to make them understand the concerns,” said a senior official in the revenue department.An official in the office of New Delhi district magistrate said that they received the DDMA order on Tuesday and issued necessary instructions. “All SDMs were instructed on Tuesday to find additional spaces to accommodate more beds and also for burial grounds. The process is going on and it will take 2-3 days to identify such locations. Our priority is that such places should be away from the residential areas,” the official said.Deepak Shinde, DM north, said, “We have initiated the process. No location has been finalised yet.” Shinde, however, did not explain why the district administration is facing difficulties in finding space.The DDMA officials, however, did not clarify how much additional time could be given to the district officials to finish the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/igi-stadium-siri-fort-sports-complex-may-be-turned-into-extended-covid-hospitals/story-HkHvQtf0QL9IohCoUVD1hO.html
04-06-2020||Delhi||Seven days’ home isolation mandatory for all asymptomatic individuals arriving in Delhi||The Delhi government on Wednesday issued an order making seven days’ home isolation mandatory for all asymptomatic individuals arriving in the city via planes and trains. Interstate buses are yet to resume operations in Delhi.Earlier, asymptomatic individuals arriving in the city were let off but “advised” to update the district surveillance officers about their health regularly for 14 days, as per the last government order on domestic travel issued on May 24.For symptomatic individuals, the old rule continues—immediate Covid testing on arrival, institutional quarantining till the result is out, moving to a hospital or a Covid Care Centre depending on symptoms if positive, and home isolation for 14 days in case of a negative result.“We have taken this decision for aggressive Covid management,” Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Dev said.Since May 28, Delhi has recorded over 1,000 fresh Covid-19 cases every day.“In partial modification of the order issued on May 24… All asymptomatic passengers who enter or de-board in Delhi shall home quarantine themselves for 7 days, in place of 14 days’ self-monitoring of health [sic],” read the order which HT has seen.It further directs airport, railway and transport authorities to provide daily passenger details to the office of the health secretary who has further been directed to share them with district magistrates of all 11 revenue districts in the city so that they can engage teams to help and monitor each home quarantine case.The rule would apply to buses too if interstate road operations resume before further orders are issued.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has maintained that chances of an increase in cases are likely with the government further relaxing lockdown norms from this week, but Delhi’s health infrastructure is prepared for a higher caseload, even as he insisted that people with mild symptoms or no symptoms opt for home isolation and adhere to doctors’ advice.Currently, Delhi has more than 7,500 people in home isolation, compared to around 3,000 patients admitted to hospitals.Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, welcomed the initiative saying, “It can be an effective strategy to fight Covid-19. In fact, this rule should have been enforced on all arrivals after the pandemic broke out and India was yet to implement a lockdown.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/seven-days-home-isolation-mandatory-for-all-asymptomatic-individuals-arriving-in-delhi/story-jWvsnySu7VX9ao6mV0iF5H.html

Apart from this, there are 32 other patients, who are cross-notified to other states and neighbouring districts of Uttar Pradesh. Of the new cases on Wednesday, five are from sector 31 and four are from sector 30. “Of 521 positive cases till Wednesday evening, 348 patients have been discharged from different hospitals, eight patients have so far succumbed to the virus and 32 have been cross-notified from other districts and states. As a result, the district now has only 165 active cases,” said district surveillance officer Dr Sunil Dohre.Dr Dohre further said that four patients – two each from Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) and Super Specialty Paediatric Hospital and Postgraduate Teaching Institute (SSPHPGTI) – were discharged on Wednesday, after being cured.He further said that health camps were organised in 12 sensitive places in the district on Sunday, including at Mamura, Nithari, Sarfabad, Harola, sectors 8, 9 and 10. “A total of 762 patients were screened today and 15 of them, who had symptoms of fever, have been referred to the district hospital,” he said.Of the 32 cross-notified Covid-19 positive cases, the district surveillance officer said that while 13 of them are from Delhi, one patient each is from West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh, who have also been found cross-notified in the GB Nagar district. “While three patients have duplicate entries in the log, the remaining 14 are from other districts of Uttar Pradesh, including six from Bulandshahr, five from Ghaziabad, two from Hapur and one from Agra,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gautam-budh-nagar-records-25-new-cases/story-WdLUSpePiQYfUIUjlpadrL.html
04-06-2020||Noida||Covid-19: GB Nagar’s recovery rate is better than other districts sharing borders with Delhi||Gautam Budh Nagar has a Covid-19 recovery rate of 69.75% till Tuesday evening, which is the number of patients cured of infectious disease out of the total infections expressed in percentage, the highest among all districts that border Delhi.According to the figures issued by the district till Tuesday evening, 346 out of 496 Covid-19 patients were cured. Among the other districts that borders the national capital, Ghaziabad came in next with 62.9% (217 out of 345 cases), followed by Haryana’s Sonepat at 63.5% (144 out of 233 cases). Gurugram had the lowest rate at 26.7% (288 out of 1,063 cases) and Faridabad was at 34.8% (169 out of 485).Nationally, this figure is at 48.2%.With the district reporting eight deaths, the fatality rate is 1.41%, better than the national rate of 2.8%. Even in terms of weekly growth rate of Covid-19 positive cases, GB Nagar, till Tuesday evening, had the lowest rate of increase at 35.51%, followed by Sonepat (53.65%) and Ghaziabad (70.30%). Gurugram had the maximum growth rate at 227% while Faridabad recorded 107%. A 100% growth rate means that the cases doubled every seven days. Nationally, the doubling rate is 14 days.Gautam Budh Nagar district was one of the worst affected districts in India, when Covid-19 had begun its march in the country. By the second week of April, the district had 68 cases, the most in Uttar Pradesh with 41 linked to a firm base out of Sector 135.GB Nagar district magistrate (DM) Suhas LY credits the strategic approach adopted by his team of doctors and officials. “Initially, we focused on early identification of the disease, through active and passive surveillance. Then, we started contact tracing, followed by quarantine of all suspected high-risk cases. We also laid stress on ensuring proper isolation of positive cases and containment activity. And above all, we never forgot to ensure adequate sanitization and social distancing norms. All these activities have been effective in controlling the spread of disease in the district,” he said.He added that the district health officials were asked to aggressively test people for the coronavirus. “As a result, the testing index of our district is much better than the national index. While the national figure of samples taken is 1820 per million population, in GB Nagar the samples taken per million population is 4623,” he said.Suhas further said that so far 10,958 samples have been collected in the district, of which 496 tested Covid-19 positive. “While the sample positivity rate in the district is 4.74%, active cases per lakh population in GB Nagar is only 6.11. Also, the Covid-19 case doubling rate in the district is 19.14 days, which is much better than the national doubling rate of 14 days. Also, we have active cases per lakh population is 6.11, which is much better than the national index of 9.7,” he said.Brisbane-based virologist, Dr. Pranav Kumar, who was earlier with a Delhi-based hospital, said that the figures suggested that timely testing and co-ordination between the administrative and health officials. “Often there is a big gap between the reports and medication in India. But, the administration seems following up at every point in GB Nagar district,” he said over phone.Dr. Vivek Gupta, a virologist in Goverment Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), said that administration and health officials are keeping a round-the-clock watch on right from testing to discharge of patients. “Perhaps, this has made the difference,” he said.Delhi witnessed 1,513 fresh cases on Thursday, taking the total number of cases to 23,645 . At least 606 people have succumbed to the virus so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/covid-19-gb-nagar-s-recovery-rate-is-better-than-other-districts-sharing-borders-with-delhi/story-tf5khIMWrTCaR2EJg8jyCJ.html
04-06-2020||Delhi||No more Shramik Specials, remaining migrants may take buses back home||The Delhi government on Wednesday said it was unlikely to run any more Shramik Special trains for the time being, as most stranded migrant workers had left in the past month, while the others had decided to stay back as lockdown restrictions were slowly being eased and the economy was opening up, government officials said.The officials said there were too few requests from migrants now to run special trains.Following the uncertainty over the next Shramik Special from Delhi, the few remaining migrants wanting to return home are now pooling in their savings to hire private buses or taking help of NGOs.According to data shared by the Delhi government, of the 4,50,000 migrants who had applied, around 3,10,000 had been sent back free of cost to 16 states so far, in 237 special trains. The officials said 90% of these trains, which were run under a special arrangement between state governments, were bound for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The remaining were destined to Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, and Odisha. There was a train for Tamil Nadu as well. The government had also arranged 683 buses to send 12,804 migrants to their home states. Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the government has sent all registered migrants and also those who had come to their screening centres without registration, to their home states in the trains. Confirming that there might be no more Shramik trains from Delhi now, he said, “We may send more people only if they come forward.” An Indian Railways ministry official also confirmed that the last Shramik special train from Delhi was for Bihar on Sunday. ”No Shramik trains are scheduled as of now from Delhi. There is no demand from the Delhi government as of now,” the official said. A senior government official, however, said they might arrange buses for migrants willing to go back home next. “Some migrants from different states are still willing to go home and have applied for Shramik trains. But it won’t be possible to send them on trains since their number is too low and they are from different destinations. The most efficient way now will be to send them home on buses,” the official said.Officials also said that a number of people who had applied for special trains had decided to stay back also . “The government even tried to contact those who had registered and did not turn up for screening. Many said they had found work in Delhi and had decided to stay back,” a senior official said.One such migrant who decided to stay back is Ranjeet Kumar (39), who used to work at a clothes and bags shop in Karol Bagh. He said he had registered for a Shramik train to Bihar’s Muzaffarpur, but last week got a call from his employer asking him to come back to work. “I wanted to leave, as there was no work and I had no money to send home. I had planned to go back and become a labourer in my village. But my owner called me right before i left to say he is short staffed and promised to pay me extra. So, I changed my mind,” he said.Also read: Documenting the story of India’s migrant distress | AnalysisOn Wednesday, groups of migrants could still be seen outside government screening centres and railway stations inquiring about Shramik trains. On Monday afternoon, Asif, 27, had reached a screening centre in Lajpat Nagar, along five others, to inquire about a train to Bihar. The group, Asif said, works at a construction site in Sarai Kale Khan. “Work has resumed at the site but now the working hours are less and so is the income. We have spent whatever we had saved in the last two and a half months. We have now decided to go home. Someone told us that we can get a ticket from here, but we were told here that there are no more trains,” he said.Meanwhile, around 260 migrants from Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and UP, are looking at NGOs to help arrange buses to take them home..Sunil Kumar Aledia, founder, Centre for Holistic Development (CHD), an NGO that works for the homeless, said that they have arranged for seven buses to take 169 migrants to various districts of Bihar on Wednesday. “We have been getting requests from a number of people from different parts of the city, who were still stuck and have no money to arrange for their travels. We sought help from south district authorities for thermal screening of these people at the Chhatarpur centre, after which they will be made to board the buses,” he said. B M Mishra, district magistrate (South), said, “All the stranded migrants from the district have been sent home. Some NGOs asked us for support for helping with the screening of migrants from different parts of the city and we will pitch in whatever ways we can.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-more-shramik-specials-remaining-migrants-may-take-buses-back-home/story-32wTbdoilRPqqwkBylW1BK.html
04-06-2020||Delhi||Constable dies of lung ailment, result of Covid test yet to arrive||A 32-year-old Delhi Police constable died during treatment at the Safdarjung Hospital early Wednesday morning, a day after he was admitted there for a lung ailment, the police said. As per the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) protocol, the constable was tested for the virus on Wednesday itself and the report is yet to arrive, senior police officers said.The constable, Rahul (known by his first name), was posted in the office of the deputy commissioner of police (northeast) in Welcome area. He had joined the force in 2010. He was suffering from a lung disease for nearly a year and had been on medical leave for the past several months. Almost 85% of his lungs were not functioning, DCP (northeast) Ved Prakash Surya said.DCP Surya said that the constable was first admitted to a tuberculosis (TB) hospital in south Delhi’s Mehrauli two days ago. On Tuesday, his condition deteriorated, after which he was tested for Covid-19 at the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and he was later shifted to Safdarjung Hospital, the DCP said.“He died during treatment early Wednesday morning. His medical reports to ascertain if he was suffering from tuberculosis or infected with Covid-19 are awaited,” a police officer, who did not want to be identified, said.The constable was from Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh.Three police personnel, including two assistant sub-inspectors, have died of Covid-19 so far.

04-06-2020||Delhi||Huge gridlock at UP-Delhi border as cops intensify checking, barricade e-way||Thousands of commuters were stranded for hours in a huge gridlock at the Delhi-Ghaziabad border on Wednesday owing to stricter checking by the police and the barricading of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway that diverted all traffic to a single carriageway towards Delhi. The snarls, commuters say, began around 9am and led to long tailbacks that stretched even into the internal roads of Ghaziabad. The problem was further compounded by toll collection from commercial vehicles on the same road where the police check posts were placed. Hundreds of motorists took over 40 minutes to cross the Ghazipur border. The congestion finally cleared up by 2pm, after the Delhi Police eased up on checks.On Monday, the Delhi government had sealed the national capital borders to protect its health care resources even as Covid-19 cases in the city crossed the 20,000-mark. Ghaziabad had placed similar restrictions since April 22, citing a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the district which were linked to residents who had travelled to Delhi.On Tuesday, the police had gone easy on the checking, allowing into Delhi almost everyone. The scene, however, was different on Wednesday. Early morning, police placed concrete bollards on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, blocking the entry of vehicles into Delhi. Motorists coming from Meerut, Ghaziabad, Indirapuram, Raj Nagar and even Noida, found themselves stuck in long snarls, as the entire traffic was redirected to a single carriageway to Delhi.“I had to reach the Supreme Court for urgent work and got stuck in the jam for almost an hour. There was a long queue of vehicles ahead of me,” Shashi Shekhar, an advocate from Indirapuram, said.Both Delhi and Uttar Pradesh police personnel deployed at the border blamed each other for blocking the expressway flyover. But that was not the end of the commuters’ woes. Below the flyover, the police placed barricades and opened only one lane to motorists.While the move allowed the police to check the passes of a large number of motorists entering Delhi, it caused a bottleneck and resulted in the jam getting longer.The Ghaziabad police said the checking of vehicles by the Delhi Police led to the jams. “The Delhi Police were checking vehicles, slowing down traffic. We had long queues on the Ghaziabad side. On our side, we were checking vehicles entering Ghaziabad from Delhi,” Anshu Jain, circle officer (Indirapuram), said.Among vehicles stranded in the gridlock were ambulances destined for Delhi.“I am carrying a critical patient to AIIMS from UP’s Sambhal. Our entire journey till Indirapuram was smooth. But from there onwards, the traffic was thick. We got stuck in the jam for more than 45 minutes,” the ambulance driver, who refused to share his name, said.“I have a train to catch to my hometown in Uttar Pradesh from New Delhi railway station. I may miss the train if I am stuck in the jam for another 15-20 minutes,” Navin Verma, a student travelling in an auto-rickshaw from Noida’s Secto 58, said.When the situation threatened to go out of control, around 11am, the police decided to lift the barricades and let vehicles pass through without any checking. The Expressway flyover, however, continued to remain blocked. The chaos continued till around 2pm, after which the police relaxed the checking to avoid further congestion.“Initially, we were only checking vehicles intermittently to spare commuters the inconvenience. But when many complaints were received that no checking was being done at the border, we put up barricades and increased the checking. That caused long snarls. Later, we relaxed the checking to avoid further congestion,” deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/huge-gridlock-at-up-delhi-border-as-cops-intensify-checking-barricade-e-way/story-dR2y6jTgVGxVBq5dOaTBSM.html
04-06-2020||Gurugram||Public spaces to be made friendly for pedestrians, informal sector workers||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has decided to no longer undertake road expansion projects within its jurisdiction, and to instead utilise available space along arterial roads for walking paths, cycling tracks and green belts, authority chief VS Kundu said Wednesday. Speaking at a webinar titled ‘Active Mobility Post Lockdown’, Kundu said though it had been decided earlier this year to halt the expansion of carriageways, the lockdown has ensured there is no going back on the same, and strengthened the GMDA’s resolve to make streets more accessible. The GMDA chief said that the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on disrupting mobility in the city, as well as posed as a setback for the enhancement of public transport systems in Gurugram. “With the decrease in traffic during the national lockdown, imposed to control the virus’ outbreak, and seeing the need for social distancing, there is no need to expand roads any further. Instead, we will be utilising the same space to create facilities to ease movements of pedestrians and cyclists. This will hopefully offset the increase in use of private vehicles, which we are anticipating,” Kundu said.He added that the GMDA’s comprehensive mobility plan (CMP) for Gurugram, which was delayed due to the lockdown, will now be put through another round of public feedback. “We appeal to experts to help us devise a mobility plan in line with the demands of a rapidly changing world,” Kundu told HT over the phone after the webinar. Organised by the World Resources Institute (India), in partnership with The Raahgiri Foundation, the GMDA and the National Institute of Urban Affairs, the webinar featured transport entrepreneurs, urban planners and administrators. Among the range of topics discussed were changing public mobility trends in the wake of Covid-19 and the need to plan sustainable transport systems that can ensure social distancing, as economies around the world open up. “The irony is that Gurugram, which is where the Raahgiri movement of car-free streets began, has not been able to accommodate the demands of pedestrian-friendly mobility and equitable streets. The lockdown presents a challenge to mobility, as we anticipate an increasing preference for private vehicles in a post-Covid world. But at the same time, we also need to reallocate street space so that those who can work from home continue to do so, while the informal economy is given space to come out onto the streets, where they make their living,” Kundu said, addressing the panel. However, he and other experts on the panel agreed that for a city like Gurugram, this poses an almost insurmountable challenge. According to Robin Chase, a transport entrepreneur based in the US, “Indian cities will have to deal with large sections of the informal economy coming back as streets open up. We urgently need to create spaces for them, and we need to reallocate space away from cars and reserve them for micro-mobility such as electric scooters, which can enable social distancing. The lockdown is a grey area in which these negotiations can be revisited,” said Chase.In agreement with this statement, Kundu added, “It will be a challenge for Gurugram. I don’t mean to be pessimistic, but you have to consider that an entire section of the population cannot switch to sustainable transport within the next few months. We have to do this in a phased manner.” Other experts said that the link between transport advocacy and health advocacy has become much clearer in the wake of the pandemic, which is caused by a respiratory pathogen. Margarita Parra from the Silicon Valley Bike Association pointed out that adopting cleaner means of transportation is imperative. “Early evidence does suggest that poor air quality puts people at a higher risk of mortality due to Covid-19. So we need to act now to reduce vehicular emissions.” This view was echoed by National Institute of Urban director Affairs Hitesh Vaidya, who said the real key is in getting the middle class to change their habits. He pointed out that in order to maintain social distancing, metro and bus services would have to run at between five to seven times their previous capacity, which may not be practically feasible. “This presents two scenarios. Indian cities like Delhi and Gurugram can either make a conscientious shift toward improving walking and cycling infrastructure, thereby reducing dependency on diminished public transport, as cities like London, Bogota, Milan and New York are doing, or it could result in a forced shift to private vehicles,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/public-spaces-to-be-made-friendly-for-pedestrians-informal-sector-workers/story-pdD3889zFxh36zBrW1FMHI.html

These include 7,185 isolation beds, 2,415 isolation beds with oxygen facility and 384 ventilators for the treatment of people affected with Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection.On May 21, the Maharashtra government issued an order to cap prices on beds and ventilators. The price regulation is for 80 per cent of beds for Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients on first come, first served basis. As per the data compiled by PMC, private hospitals have 8,982 isolation beds, 3,091 isolation beds with oxygen and 480 ventilators and the process to acquire these has begun.Out of these, as of June 2, price regulation has been imposed on 3,674 operational beds. The civic body would get 1,981 wall oxygen supply beds and 2,385 beds without wall oxygen supply. In addition, the regulated prices mean 848 more oxygen cylinders, 536 ICU beds and 279 ventilators available for patient treatment at regulated prices.Shekhar Gaikwad, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner, said, “The state government order is applicable to all private hospitals since the date of the order issued. We have also intimated to them about the Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act (MESMA), 2017, and we will ensure that private hospitals follow the capping of price on 80 per cent of beds through our health department.”“We have also asked private hospitals to fill up information on dashboard on the number of isolation beds, ICU facility and ventilators,” said Gaikwad.Dr Sunil Rao, group medical director, Sahyadri Hospital, said, “The notification says that 80 per cent of beds and ventilators will be charged as per the capped rate and prices should be displayed for transparency for patients. The beds will be allowed for both Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients so that their treatment is not hampered.”“We have started admitting patients as per the new capped price on first come, first served basis,” he added.The capped price range from Rs 4,000-Rs 9,000 for beds depending on the patient’s medical condition. As per the civic body’s projections, the city will fall short of ventilators and ICU by June-end if the estimated count of patients reaches around 22,000.As per the civic body’s projection, the count is estimated to touch 22,940 cases as of June 30 and the number of active cases by June end would reach 9,743 which would lead to a shortfall of 162 ICU beds and 34 ventilators by the month-end.As of June 2, the civic body has 61 Covid facilities, which have 15,512 isolation beds, 15,484 isolation beds without oxygen and 2,512 isolation beds with oxygen, 580 ICU beds and 288 ventilators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-adds-10k-additional-beds-pvt-hospitals-admit-patients-as-per-capped-price/story-8QxVVXK3i0ptPSUlw0FVbN.html

Gurav is using her vacation time by practicing at home and practicing inside a wedding hall. Before the lockdown, she travelled for 65 kilometres on the weekend to play in Pune. “I love to come to Pune and play cricket. Monday is my off day while other days I am practising for one-and –a-half hours. Since there are holidays, I practice in the morning and evening. My favourite player is MS Dhoni,” Swara Gurav said.Gurav is too young to play professionally, but her footwork and stance have already impressed international players and coaches. A video on Twitter featuring Gurav brought praise from Mike Hesson, Royal Challengers Bangalore coach, former India captain Mithali Raj and Jemimah Rodrigues.India A cricketer Tejal Hasabnis who is currently enjoying lockdown at her home said, “Special kid, very skillful, I just wish while growing up she will enjoy what she is doing right now and we shouldn’t be surprised if we see her taking this sport professionally.”Ambade village doesn’t have a ground to practice, but Gurav’s father Sachin Gurav, who is a priest at a temple there, is making all the arrangements for her.“Since the age of three, Swara had very good catching skills. I used to throw a plastic ball at her and she used to catch it. From that point, this journey began,” said Sachin Gurav, who used to play for his village team.Sachin’s financial condition never allowed him to make progress in sports, but for her daughter, he already has a plan ready.“At the age of four-and-a-half she used to play with a tennis ball. I started to take her to Bhor to train under Vishwajeet Tarv who runs a small academy with 35 players at the Jijau Mata school ground in Bhor,” Sachin added.Gurav started to groom under Tarv, where she learned the basics of the cricket game.“Right from her initial days, Swara was a quick learner, whatever is told to her she used to grasp it quickly,” Tarv said.Along with this, Gurav’s father began giving her practice at a wedding hall.“I have installed nets at the wedding hall where I only bowl at her. I keep taking guidance from her coaches Tarv sir and Ganesh Gaikwad sir from Azam Campus,” added Sachin.Training in PuneSince the last six months, every weekend Gurav is training at the Azam Campus, Camp, under Ganesh Gaikwad, head coach at Azam Campus.“I started training her with hanging balls drills and all the basic drills. Her ball sense is one thing which is the most impressive when to come on the front foot and when to go on back foot she knows it perfectly,” explains Gaikwad.“I must say she is a natural talent, gradually we have started throwing down leather balls at her and she has all the potential to become a good cricketer” added Gaikwad.It is just the beginning for his daughter and Sachin Gurav knows a lot more hard work and dedication will make his daughter a player for the future.“Swara still has two years to focus on basics. I hope she can practice with the leather ball regularly,” added Sachin Gurav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-s-wonder-girl-cover-drives-past-lockdown-to-win-cricketing-hearts/story-epFFVHT5lodfs7VG15w8aI.html

On June 2, the municipal corporation filed a report against the canine’s owner at the Jamalpur police station and asked the police to find her. “The pit bull eats nothing but chicken. Now, a bill of Rs 6,000 is outstanding with the chicken shop owner,” said an MC official. The dog is being kept in a cage at the MC’s Animal Birth Control (ABC) Centre in the Haibowal Dairy Complex.MC senior veterinary officer Dr Harbans Dhalla said, “A few dog lovers helped us identify the owner. A woman, who claimed to be the dog’s owner called in May, saying she was a resident of Jamalpur but was stuck in Patna due to the lockdown. She also shared pictures of herself with the dog.”“The woman promised to come and get the dog once domestic flights resume, but she has failed to show up till now. Her contact number is no longer reachable,” Dhalla said.Dhalla said they had been planning to hand over the canine to one of the dog lovers in the city, but then decided against it as the pit bull is too ferocious to be handed over to anyone other than the owner.STAFF IN TERROR OF CANINE “Even the staff members at the ABC Centre do not go near the dog as he is very aggressive. I have given photographs of the dog and its owner to the Jamalpur police,” Dhalla said, adding that if the dog wasn’t taken off their hands soon its diet will have to be changed.Dhalla said if anyone had any leads on the whereabouts of the dog’s owner, they can share it on 98150-91107.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/abandoned-pit-bull-saddles-ludhiana-mc-with-rs-6-000-chicken-bill/story-XUHOkLl2Tslk3wtoaCo2FI.html
04-06-2020||World||Covid-19: UK minister Alok Sharma tests negative||Alok Sharma, cabinet minister in charge of Business in the Boris Johnson government who went into self-isolation on Wednesday evening, tested negative for coronavirus, he announced on Thursday evening.Agra-born Sharma, 52, was visibly uneasy and sweating as he read out a statement to MPs in the House of Commons. He later went home to self-isolate and had a test for the virus, amidst growing concerns about parliament’s functioning during the pandemic.Sharma tweeted: “Huge thanks to everyone for their really kind messages over the last 24 hours and my grateful thanks also to the parliamentary authorities and Speaker for their support yesterday. Just had results in and my test for #COVIDー19 was negative”.While delivering the second reading of the corporate governance and insolvency bill, Sharma, who is also COP26 president, was seen repeatedly wiping his face with a handkerchief, while the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, passed him a glass of water.His situation may have been caused by a bout of hay fever, Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis said on Thursday morning.Sharma’s condition brought into focus the new arrangements in the House of Commons, by which MPs who were in self-isolation were no longer allowed to participate or vote remotely but had to be present in person. It led to long queues around the Westminster complex on Tuesday during a vote.Besides Johnson, who was hospitalised in a serious condition after contracting virus in April, health secretary Matt Hancock and defence secretary Ben Wallace have also been affected, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-minister-alok-sharma-tests-negative/story-NKasNEYEZj6qm6Q0G2At0K.html
04-06-2020||World||Thousands join peaceful George Floyd protests in NYC, then an ambush amid curfew||A day that began with hope that New York City was beginning to find a way out of the crisis caused by the coronavirus and a week of angry demonstrations over police brutality ended Wednesday with more violence.Peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd drew thousands of people, but were broken up by police as rain poured down about an hour after the city’s 8 pm curfew went into effect.Then, with the streets quiet for the first time in days, police said a man ambushed officers on an anti-looting patrol in Brooklyn, stabbing him in the neck. The attacker was shot by responding officers and was in critical condition.Two officers suffered gunshot wounds to their hands in the chaos, but all three wounded officers were expected to recover.Police Commissioner Dermot Shea called it “a completely, cowardly, despicable, unprovoked attack on a defenseless police officer.” While he declined to say what motivated the attack, he drew a line to the heated rhetoric of the past week, in which angry crowds decrying police violence have also hurled insults, and sometimes bottles, bricks and firebombs, at officers and their vehicles.“Words matter,” Shea said.More protests were planned for Thursday around New York, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo called for a statewide moment of silence at 2 p.m., to coincide with a memorial service in Minnesota for Floyd.Wednesday night’s attack came at the end of the day in which the police had drawn praise for bringing a stop to days of pilfering and destruction in some parts of the city, but also harsh criticism for rough tactics used to enforce the city’s curfew.About an hour after the 8 p.m. deadline to get off the street, officers began moving in on crowds of demonstrators in Manhattan and Brooklyn, at times blasting people with pepper spray or using batons to shove people who didn’t move fast enough.Asked whether those officers had acted appropriately, de Blasio said Thursday that he had not seen videos of officers using batons on peaceful protesters. He added, “ if there’s anything that needs to be reviewed.”The mayor said protesters should observe the curfew that’s in place through Sunday. “If at a certain point, officers say, ‘It’s time, people need to go now,’ people need to listen to that,” he said.NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan said about 60 people were arrested near Central Park for defying an order to go home.“When we have these big crowds, especially in this area, especially where we’ve had the looting, no more tolerance,” Monahan said. “They have to be off the street.”City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who attended a rally in downtown Brooklyn, expressed outrage that police had broken up the peaceful demonstration by shoving protesters and hitting them with batons.“I can’t believe what I just witnessed & experienced,” Williams wrote on Twitter. He called the use of force on nonviolent protesters “disgusting.”As the evening deepened, there were few reports of the mayhem that had occurred on several days of demonstrations, when protesters burned police vehicles and showered officers with debris. Gone also were the roving bands of people who smashed their way into scores of stores and stole merchandise Sunday and Monday nights.During the day, some protesters had been heartened by news that three more Minneapolis police officers had been charged in connection to the May 25 death of Floyd, a black man who died after an officer pressed a knee on his neck.But most said they wanted bigger societal changes to fight institutional racism in policing.“There’s been progress, but are we at a point where we can all celebrate? No,” said demonstrator Lisa Horton, calling for “radical change” in the criminal justice system.Tuesday night’s protests had also been mostly peaceful, prompting de Blasio to declare that an early curfew was working.It is set to remain in effect through at least Sunday, with the city planning to lift it at the same time it enters the first phase of reopening after more than two months of shutdowns because of the coronavirus.___Jennifer Peltz, Brian Mahoney and Jake Seiner in New York City and Marina Villeneuve in Albany contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-join-peaceful-george-floyd-protests-in-nyc-then-an-ambush-amid-curfew/story-z90ToxDTVLC2PAiFDxZVfL.html
04-06-2020||World||George Floyd was infected with Covid-19, autopsy reveals||George Floyd, whose fatal encounter with Minneapolis police stirred a global outcry over racial bias by U.S. law enforcement, tested positive for the coronavirus, his autopsy showed, but the infection was not listed as a factor in his death.The official cause of death, according to the full 20-page report made public on Wednesday by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office, was cardiopulmonary arrest while Floyd was being restrained by police taking him into custody on May 25.The coroner ruled the manner of death to be a homicide. Four police officers since fired from their jobs for their role in the incident, which was captured on a bystander’s cellphone video, are being held on criminal charges, one of them accused of murder.The video showed that officer using his knee to press Floyd’s neck into the street for nearly nine minutes while the 46-year-old victim gasped for air and repeatedly groaned, “please, I can’t breathe.” Floyd was pronounced dead at a hospital a short time later.The video immediately went viral on the internet, igniting nine days of nationwide protest and civil strife. Demonstrators have also taken to the streets overseas, from Germany to New Zealand.The autopsy, in listing cardiopulmonary arrest as the cause of Floyd’s death, also cited “complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression.”The report listed several additional factors as “significant conditions” contributing to Floyd’s death, including heart disease, high blood pressure and intoxication from the powerful opioid fentanyl, as well as recent methamphetamine use.The report further noted that a nasal swab sample collected from Floyd’s body came back positive for Covid-19, and that Floyd had also tested positive on April 3, nearly eight weeks before his death. The county’s chief medical examiner, Dr. Andrew Baker, concluded that the post mortem test result “most likely reflects asymptomatic but persistent ... positivity from previous infection.” There was no indication in the autopsy report that coronavirus played any role in Floyd’s death.Dr. Michael Baden, one of two medical examiners who conducted a private autopsy for Floyd’s family, told the New York Times that county officials never told him, or the funeral director, that Floyd had tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-was-infected-with-covid-19-autopsy-reveals/story-P3YIr7u9pg06vxkzdeUsyJ.html
04-06-2020||World||Thousands of China’s movie screens could be shut forever||Thousands of film theatres in China could never open again under the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak, a new survey by film industry insiders has revealed, adding that lay-offs in the industry have also started.China has the largest number of movie screens in the world but all have been shut since January 23, the day the central Chinese city of Wuhan was locked down to contain the spread of the coronavirus.In 2019, China added 9708 new screens to take the total number of screens to 69787; in 2019, China also had the second-largest box office in the world after the US.The outbreak impact has already wiped out more than 30 billion yuan ($4.24 billion) from the 2020 box office, a government official said in April.Now, the survey, jointly done by the China Film Association (CFA), the China Film Distribution and Screening Association and leading cinema chains including Wanda, reveals a picture that’s not optimistic.Also read | Wuhan tests 10 million people, only 300 test positive for Covid-19“Under the continuous influence of the epidemic, more than 40% of the theatres may face survival difficulties,” the report said after conducting a survey of 187 theatres at the end of April.If the findings of the survey are extrapolated to the Chinese theatre and box office that would mean thousands of screens shut for ever and the loss of a large number of jobs.The Chinese government had said earlier that cinemas in regions with low coronavirus risks can reopen with reduced capacity and daily disinfecting measures but those measures are yet to be implemented.Some theatres, according to a Reuters report, were briefly allowed to reopen after the number of new cases sharply dropped in China. However, they were later shut again amid worries that early relaxation of lockdowns could spark another wave of infections.The long closure is impacting the livelihood of a large number of people involved in the long and complex chain of film making, distribution and screening.“The survey shows that at the end of March, 20% of the theaters had laid off staff. Most of these layoff theaters are small and medium-sized cinemas with less than 1,000 seats,” it said.“As many as 42% of theaters believe that they are at risk of ‘closing the door’; only 10% of theaters are likely to change hands and continue to operate,” the survey said.Will there be a boom after the outbreak is declared over? From the findings of the survey, the outlook isn’t optimistic.“Will theaters usher in an explosive movie watching boom after resuming business? Half of the theaters believe that it will take at least 3-6 months to reach the pre-epidemic viewing status after resuming business, and 37% of theaters believe that it will take more than half a year,” the survey added.According to Variety.com, the film and entertainment website, the closures would mean a year-on-year fall in box office of 66% from last year’s 64.3 billion yuan ($9.01 billion) to 21.8 billion yuan ($3.05 billion).However, a reopening that is delayed to October would cut 2020 revenues by 91%, down to just 5.79 billion yuan ($810 million), according to the CFA’s calculations.Also read | China says no ‘third party’ needed after PM Modi, Trump discuss Ladakh standoff||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-china-s-nearly-70-000-movie-screens-could-be-shut-forever/story-DTvfpbJuEpCxqcZrv2tTnI.html
04-06-2020||World||1.9 million in US seek jobless aid even as reopenings slow layoffs||Nearly 1.9 million people applied for US unemployment benefits last week, the ninth straight decline since applications spiked in mid-March, a sign that the gradual reopening of businesses has slowed the loss of jobs.The diminishing pace suggests that the job market meltdown that was triggered by the coronavirus may have bottomed out as more companies call at least some of their former employees back to work.The total number of people who are now receiving jobless aid rose only slightly to 21.5 million, suggesting that rehiring is offsetting some of the ongoing layoffs.Though applications for benefits are slowing, the latest weekly number is still more than double the record high that prevailed before the viral outbreak. It shows that there are limits to how much a partial reopening of the economy can restore a depressed job market mired in a recession.With all states in the process of gradually reopening for business, more consumers are starting to return to restaurants, stores and hair salons. That trend has boosted consumer spending from exceedingly low levels and has likely encouraged some companies to hire again.In addition to the laid-off employees who applied for benefits last week, 623,000 others sought jobless aid under a new program for self-employed and gig workers, who now qualify for unemployment benefits for the first time. These figures aren’t adjusted for seasonal variations, so the government doesn’t include them in the overall data.The figures come one day before the government’s jobs report for May is expected to show that employers slashed 8 million jobs last month and that the unemployment rate jumped from 14.7 per cent to 19.8 per cent. If those forecasts prove accurate, it would mean that nearly 30 million people have lost jobs since the viral outbreak intensified in March and that joblessness has reached its highest point since the Great Depression.Since mid-March, 42.7 million people have applied for unemployment benefits. Not all of them are still unemployed, though. Some have since been rehired. And some laid-off people, it turns out, filed duplicate applications for benefits as they struggled with unresponsive state unemployment systems.Thursday’s report wasn’t affected by the protests over the killing of George Floyd, which in recent days forced some major retailers and small businesses to close, because it covers claims filed only through May 30. But some economists warn that applications for unemployment aid could rise in next week’s report, reflecting business closures amid the protests and scattered vandalism.“That’s going to kick up the claims again,” said Jane Oates, a former Labor Department official.The depth of the job cuts since the virus forced the widespread shutdown of businesses reflects an economy gripped by the worst downturn since the Great Depression. The economy is thought to be shrinking in the April-June quarter at an annual rate approaching 40 per cent. That would be, by far, the worst quarterly contraction on record.Still, real-time private data on consumer behavior is showing signs that the economy is gradually reviving. Credit and debit card spending tracked by Chase Bank shows that consumer spending, though roughly flat last week, rebounded from its low point in mid-April, when it was 40 per cent below year-ago levels. Now, it is down 20 per cent from a year ago.Economists caution that most Americans will need to feel more confident about returning to their former habits of shopping, travelling and eating out before the economy can sustain any meaningful recovery. That will likely require the availability of a vaccine or a significant increase in testing.“What’s really going to move the needle economically is when consumers and businesses feel comfortable re-engaging with the economy the way they did before COVID-19,” said Adam Kamins, a senior regional economist at Moody’s Analytics.Some businesses that have reopened have seen only a limited number of customers so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-9-million-in-us-seek-jobless-aid-even-as-reopenings-slow-layoffs/story-pwSoSfp97hJ6YxBWhpmJiK.html
04-06-2020||World||Key Oxford Covid-19 vaccine trial extends to Brazil||The clinical trial for a vaccine for coronavirus conducted by experts at the University of Oxford will soon recruit 2,000 volunteers in Brazil – one of the worst affected countries – after the country’s health regulator approved the trial currently in its Phase II.The university said on Thursday that the widely-watched work on the vaccine is “progressing quickly”. The UK government and biopharma major AstraZeneca have been gearing up to put in place facilities to produce the vaccine on a mass scale, if the results are encouraging.The trial’s Phase I/II began in April in the UK to assess safety and immune response in over 1,000 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years across several trial centres in southern England. As the trial moves to Phase III, a larger population is being enrolled consisting of 10,000 participants in the UK with AstraZeneca enrolling 30,000 participants in the US. The university said that on Tuesday, the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency approved the inclusion of Brazil in the clinical trials. Brazil is a priority for the study because of the ascendant curve of the virus there.Andrew Pollard, chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial at Oxford, said: “We are delighted to be working with the talented team of investigators in Brazil on the Covid-19 vaccine trial, as researchers and scientists around the world collaborate on clinical development work with unprecedented urgency to combat the global threat to human health that is coronavirus.”The university said it is “advancing fast” on its ongoing response to address the challenges of Covid-19, and is working with AstraZeneca to define next steps on the supply of the vaccine widely to make it accessible around the world in an equitable manner. The University of Oxford and AstraZeneca announced an agreement on April 30 for the global development and distribution of the University’s potential recombinant adenovirus vaccine aimed at preventing Covid-19 infection from SARS-CoV-2.The agreement includes a commitment to make the vaccine available on a not-for-profit basis during the pandemic and to ensure broad and equitable access around the world. To date AstraZeneca has concluded agreements for at least 400 million doses and secured total manufacturing capacity for 1bn billion doses of the Oxford vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-trial-extends-to-brazil/story-o0rQNHfgo3fwNhdPDGDexN.html
04-06-2020||World||Memorial service to be held for George Floyd after week of nationwide protests||A memorial service was to be held Thursday for George Floyd after more than a week of nationwide protests over the African American’s death at the hands of a white police officer.Led by civil rights activist Al Sharpton, the ceremony will be held in Minneapolis, where Floyd died on May 25 after being detained by police.A video showing white officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes as he pleaded for his life triggered rioting in the city and unleashed a nationwide wave of civil unrest unlike any seen in the US since the 1968 assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.Sharpton, who will give the eulogy for Floyd, met with his family on Wednesday.“Tomorrow we will lay out how we will mobilize nationally in the name of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and more,” the leading rights activist said on Twitter, referring to a black jogger who was shot dead in February and a black medical worker killed by police in her own apartment in March.Floyd’s death reignited long-felt anger over police killings of African Americans, and echoed high-profile cases that spurred the Black Lives Matter movement.Minnesota prosecutors on Wednesday increased the charges against Chauvin to second-degree murder, roughly akin to manslaughter.His three colleagues at the scene of Floyd’s arrest for allegedly seeking to buy cigarettes with a counterfeit bill were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, and taken into custody.‘Bittersweet moment’ The arrest of all four officers has been a focus for tens of thousands of protesters who have marched in the streets of dozens of US cities, often defying curfews to condemn police brutality and demand racial justice.Floyd’s family, in a statement thanking protesters, called the arrests and new charges a “bittersweet moment” -- and a “significant step forward on the road to justice.”They urged Americans to continue to “raise their voices for change in peaceful ways.”With a key demand met, protestors nevertheless staged large and mainly peaceful rallies Wednesday calling for deeper change in cities from New York to Los Angeles, hours after the new indictments were announced.Most of the protests which have swelled in cities across the country since Floyd’s death have been peaceful, but some have degenerated into rioting.US cities including Los Angeles and Washington delayed the start of their curfews by several hours Wednesday after looting and violence had subsided the previous night, while Seattle scrapped its curfew with immediate effect.But several arrests were made in New York after groups of protesters continued to march in Manhattan and Brooklyn after the city’s 8:00 pm curfew had passed. In Manhattan, protester Brian Clark earlier said the charges were “a good start” but vowed demonstrators would “exercise our right to protest until every black person gets the justice they deserve.”“It’s not enough,” added fellow demonstrator Elijah B., who did not give his last name. “This could have happened a week ago... it wasn’t until people started marching on the streets and started tearing things that people started to pay attention.”A large group also protested at the US Capitol in Washington beyond curfew.Thousands took to the streets in Hollywood and downtown Los Angeles, where Mayor Eric Garcetti vowed to redirect $250 million toward black community health and education from budgets including the police department.‘Law and order’While condemning Floyd’s death, President Donald Trump has adopted a tough stance towards the protesters, saying they include many “bad people” and calling on governors to “dominate the streets.”“We need law and order,” he repeated on Wednesday.Pressure on Trump, who has rejected the traditional presidential role of healer in times of crisis, has mounted as his former Pentagon chief Jim Mattis accused the Republican leader of trying to divide America.Mattis called Trump “the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people -- does not even pretend to try.”“Instead, he tries to divide us,” the retired Marine general said in a blistering statement posted online by The Atlantic.Trump snapped back on Twitter, calling Mattis “the world’s most overrated General.”The US president has raised the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy active duty troops to quell unrest.But Mattis’ successor Mark Esper said that option should only be used as “a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations.” “We are not in one of those situations now. I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act,” said the current defense secretary.White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said Wednesday that the act remains “a tool available” to the president, who is facing a tough reelection battle in November.“The president wants to protect America’s streets,” McEnany said, describing the criticism from Mattis as “a self-promotional stunt to appease the DC elite.”Trump meanwhile denied media reports that he was rushed for his safety to the White House bunker while protests raged in the streets outside.“It was a false report,” Trump told Fox News Radio, before saying that he did go into the secure area for an “inspection” and only for a “tiny, little, short period of time.”Reports of Trump taking shelter sparked a wave of online mockery, which is believed to have contributed to his decision on Monday to make a controversial visit to a partly damaged church near the White House.Police violently dispersed mostly peaceful crowds of protesters to clear a path for Trump, and the photo opportunity was widely condemned.burs-mtp/dw||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/memorial-service-to-be-held-for-george-floyd-after-week-of-nationwide-protests/story-e8w3LuCt2JDv5Ga7ILoIGP.html

While Palestinians could be hurt by the move, it is an instrument of pressure the authority has wielded on several occasions to try to push Israel to reverse course on policy decisions. Without these transfers, which account for about 60% of its budget, the authority risks collapsing and forcing Israel to take responsibility for 2.6 million Palestinians.Israel has said it plans to annex some 30% of the West Bank, as provided for in the Trump administration’s Middle East peace plan. Action could be taken as early as July 1, under the new Israeli government’s coalition agreement.Hussein Al Sheikh, the Palestinian Authority’s head of the General Authority of Civil Affairs, said the rejection of the May tax transfer was an extension of last month’s declaration that the Palestinians are no longer bound to past agreements to cooperate with Israel and the U.S.“We refuse to be blackmailed by the Israeli government,” Palestinian government spokesman Ibrahim Melhim said.Israel’s Finance Ministry declined to comment. Under 1990s accords, Israel collects customs duties and other taxes on behalf of the Palestinians and transfers them to their limited self-rule government each month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-reject-cash-from-israel-to-protest-annexation-plan/story-VgVxfINKhzZdQ29dsZRoQN.html

Unlike many other advanced economies, it included permanent residents who call Japan home and spouses of Japanese nationals among those forbidden to enter.Japan had encouraged foreign workers to come to the country to ease a labor shortage resulting from its aging and shrinking population. The number of foreign workers almost doubled to 1.5 million in 2019.Some resident foreigners are currently stuck outside the country, while others have missed family funerals overseas due to the travel ban, sparking an online campaign for a change in policy. Japanese nationals, though discouraged from traveling, are permitted to return.Japan Welcomed Foreign Workers Then Left Them in Covid-19 LimboPublic broadcaster NHK, which reported the news, said immigration authorities had given examples such as visiting a dying relative, attending a family funeral, or the need to attend follow-up exams after undergoing surgery overseas. The Immigration Services Agency did not immediately respond to a request for further details.Japan, whose strict border measures are set to stay in place at least until the end of June, has said it’s in discussions with Vietnam about the resumption of business travel between the two countries. The Asahi newspaper and others have said the country is also considering loosening restrictions on travel with Thailand, Australia and New Zealand, all of which have relatively few cases of the disease.Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi has said loosening of Japan’s borders in general is likely to start with business travel and visits by experts, followed by foreign students, with tourism likely to come later.The country’s travel policies are set to come to the test next year when Tokyo hosts the Summer Olympics, which were pushed back by a year due to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-japan-to-allow-re-entry-of-foreign-nationals-on-humanitarian-grounds/story-egSvr4nvOV962k3C0uWrnJ.html

The suspect Li was arrested.Local authorities told state media that at least eight ambulances were dispatched to the school to rush the victims to the nearest hospitals.At least two of the victims were seriously injured in the knife attack.Their identities were not immediately revealed.No one had sustained a life-threatening injury, local authorities told state media.China has a history of knife attacks mostly carried out by disgruntled employees or mentally disturbed persons.A disgruntled school worker had gone a similar rampage at a primary school in Beijing in January, 2019, attacking 20 students, injuring at least three of them seriously.Many such attacks are triggered by personal grievances.In April, 2018, a 28-year-old man killed nine middle-school students as they were returning home in one of the country’s deadliest knife attacks in recent years, news agency AFP reported. The killer, who said he had been bullied when he attended the school in northern China’s Shaanxi province, was executed in September, the news agency further reported.In 2012, a knife-wielding man in central China had attacked dozens of kindergarten children because of family problems.Two children were stabbed to death outside a Shanghai kindergarten in June, 2018, while nine children died in a similar attack at a school in Shaanxi province in April.In October, 2018, a woman stabbed at least 14 children at a kindergarten in southwest China’s Chongqing city.Reports said a woman attacked the children with a kitchen knife inside the school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/security-guard-stabs-39-including-children-inside-primary-school-in-south-china/story-6KQrRAEuMn1tUDZyYyYA1K.html

The motive remains unknown.The attack was an eerie throwback to deadly attacks at schools in China over past years that prompted security upgrades and that authorities have blamed largely on people bearing grudges or who had unidentified mental illnesses.The local government in the Guangxi region’s Cangwu county said 37 students and two adults suffered injuries of varying degrees in the attack.Chinese state media identified the attacker as a security guard at the school surnamed Li. The suspect had been detained while an investigation was underway, they said.State broadcaster CCTV said 40 had been injured, three seriously, including the head of the school, another security guard and a student.In earlier attacks, a woman wielding a knife injured 14 children at a kindergarten in the western city of Chongqing in October 2018.Almost 20 children were killed in school attacks in 2010, prompting a response from top government officials and leading many schools to add gates and security guards.Chinese law restricts the sale and possession of firearms, and mass attacks are generally carried out with knives or homemade explosives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/security-guard-injures-39-in-knife-attack-at-a-kindergarten-in-china/story-4xWyUuP3vzCx9cw49DZmEJ.html
04-06-2020||World||‘Hunger or murder’: Lockdown poverty exposes African sex workers to more violence||Peninah Wanjiru wasn’t really one to take chances.Her friends said the 35-year-old Kenyan sex worker was careful how she conducted business at her home in Majengo, an informal settlement on the outskirts of Nairobi, where she only allowed clients in for a “quickie”.But on the night of May 7, a curfew imposed to stem the spread of the coronavirus forced Wanjiru to allow a client to stay over. Some hours later, she was found lying in a pool of blood. She died before help could arrive.A post-mortem report found she had been stabbed multiple times in the chest and stomach and had suffered head injuries. Police are still investigating the crime.Women engaging in sex work have always been more vulnerable to violence but a surge in physical attacks and killings of sex workers in Kenya since Covid-19 restrictions came into force has sent a chill through the community.This spike in violence was attributed not only to clients attacking sex workers but also by the police and other community members who blame them for spreading the coronavirus.“It’s really frightening what we are seeing happening across the country,” said Peninah Mwangi, executive director of the Bar Hostess Empowerment and Support Programme, a sex worker-led organisation with 10,000 members in Kenya.“Our girls are really scared. We are hearing of women going with clients, only to find their bodies dumped. In one case, a sex worker was killed by her client’s family when she went to his house. Even so, they are more scared of hunger than murder.”Lockdowns are forcing desperate sex workers to disregard usual safety norms to make a living, exposing them to increased violence - and even murder, according to sex worker groups.‘Easy target at a time of crisis’With brothels and guest houses closed, sex workers in countries such as Kenya, Uganda, Senegal and Botswana, are being compelled to work alone, risking their personal safety on the streets, in clients’ residences or even in their own homes.This has led to increased violence from clients, who are often demanding lower rates and more risqué services and attacking sex workers if they refuse.The Kenya Sex Workers Alliance (KESWA), a coalition of around 30 sex worker rights groups, said it has documented six murders of sex workers since the east African nation imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on March 27.“We have security tips such as don’t go with clients who appear suspicious, inform someone of your location and don’t go to a client’s place or take him home,” said Philester Abdalla, KESWA’s national coordinator.“But people are so broke and desperate that they are not following the rules. We have children who need food, landlords who are demanding rent,” she said, adding that she was currently sheltering five evicted sex workers in her home.KESWA has recorded 80 incidences of violence against sex workers by clients, neighbours and police in the first of the month of the pandemic compared to a monthly average of 25 incidents before Covid-19 hit Kenya in mid-March, she added.From Senegal in the west to Botswana in the south, shutdowns aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus across Africa have severely hit millions of sex workers who already live on the margins of society, according to campaigners.Customers are staying away for fear of contracting the virus, and restrictions on movement, shortages of transport and closures of bars and brothels have left sex workers struggling to survive.Most are excluded from government relief packages and many have been unable to pay their rent - or evicted after brothels where they stay shut down - leaving them homeless.Already criminalised, stigmatised, and blamed for the high prevalence of AIDS in Africa, sex workers have also become more susceptible to punitive measures by police enforcing Covid-19 regulations in many countries.Grace Kamau, regional coordinator for the African Sex Workers Alliance, said police in countries such as Uganda, Kenya Ivory Coast, Malawi, Zimbabwe and South Africa, were raiding brothels and bars, assaulting and arresting sex workers.“Sex workers are an easy target in a time of crisis. Clients feel they can take advantage of them, and law enforcement think they can use them to show that they are implementing Covid-19 measures,” said Kamau.“Even the community is blaming them. Sex workers are being forced to work in their homes during the day which attracts attention ... there have been incidences of mob justice where neighbours have attacked sex workers.”In Kenya, about 800 sex workers were arrested over the last two months, with about 400 placed in quarantine centres, accused of violating social distancing restrictions, according to KESWA.While in neighbouring Uganda, campaigners said sex workers were being unfairly targeted due to their association with truck drivers - some of who had tested positive. There were 117 arrests of sex workers over a 2 week period, they said.No access to HIV treatmentStay-at-home orders have also left sex workers unable to visit health clinics and access essential services for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), say health experts.Many of those living with HIV were unable to get the life-saving treatment they needed - potentially putting their compromised immune systems at risk if they contracted Covid-19.Female sex workers are 13 times more likely to become infected with HIV than adults in the general population, according to UNAIDS, with more than 50% of sex workers in some countries in eastern and southern Africa living with HIV.A survey of 884 sex workers in Kenya conducted by KESWA found more than 65% of respondents could not get condoms and medication for HIV, such as anti-retroviral drugs, due to price hikes on public transport linked to Covid-19 restrictions.“Some sex workers are scared to go to the clinics to collect their medication for fear of contracting Covid-19,” said Olive Mumba, executive director of the Eastern Africa National Networks of AIDS and Health Service Organisations.“For others, they do not have the transport or even the money for the transport. They would rather spend the few shillings they have on food than to fetch medicines.”Mumba said of particular concern were undocumented migrant sex workers in countries such Botswana, who regularly returned to their homes in neighbouring Zimbabwe to collect medication but were now forced off treatment due to borders being closed.“We are very concerned,” said Ed Ngoksin, technical advisor on community responses and key populations at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.“From a programme’s perspective, lockdowns restrict the ability of community-based organisations to deliver services for sex workers, resulting in a lack of access to prevention, testing/treatment and care services.”He said the pandemic was having a “catastrophic impact” on communities such as sex workers and threatening to derail hard-fought progress against HIV, TB and malaria, diseases which kill millions annually.The Global Fund is providing $1 billion to help countries respond to the Covid-19, including funding sex worker-led groups to provide temporary shelters, food aid, and the home delivery of anti-retroviral drugs, Ngoskin added.Part of the solutionMany sex worker organisations are rallying members to fund raise and provide food packages for more vulnerable peers, while others are providing shelter to colleagues who have been evicted or physically abused by their partners.They are also providing them with a list of measures to help protect themselves from Covid-19 - from insisting clients sanitise their hands and conducting mobile money transactions, to avoiding kissing and positions with face-to-face contact.The Global Network of Sex Work Projects and UNAIDS have urged governments to support sex workers by giving them access to national social protection schemes, emergency aid if needed, and end evictions, brothel raids and arrests.Sex workers said they could also play an active role in stemming the pandemic if they were given the support they need.“Sex workers are indispensable allies in securing widespread adoption of effective public health measures,” said Daisy Nakato Namakula, national coordinator of Uganda Network of Sex Worker Organisations.“When sex workers are empowered and their human rights are respected, they can help communities rapidly adopt protective measures — we have seen this with HIV, and it should be the approach of Covid-19 as well. Instead, we are being attacked and discriminated against.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hunger-or-murder-lockdown-poverty-exposes-african-sex-workers-to-more-violence/story-8fwowZKKHuL1rgQKO1VFnK.html

It shows Gandhi in stride, as a leader and man of action evoking memories of his 1930 protest march against salt-tax, and the many padyatras (long marches) he undertook throughout the length and breadth of the Indian sub-continent.The statue, the design of which was created by Gautam Pal, is a gift from the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). The pedestal for the statue of Mahatma Gandhi is a block of new Imperial Red also known as Ruby Red a block originally weighing 25 tonnes reduced to a size of 9’x7’x3’4”. It now weighs 16 tonnes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gandhi-s-statue-vandalised-in-us-indian-embassy-registers-complaint/story-1Gy6fCmAdNS0yGRhhHUYOK.html
04-06-2020||World||Fired watchdog says he told Pompeo aides of probe into spending||The State Department’s fired inspector general told lawmakers that he had told senior aides to Michael Pompeo that he was investigating the secretary of state and his wife for possible misuse of government funds, undercutting Pompeo’s claim that he knew nothing about the probe.Steve Linick also confirmed he was investigating Pompeo’s emergency declaration in May 2019 that allowed for $8 billion in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia over protests from Congress, according to a joint statement by five House and Senate Democrats who participated in interviewing him Wednesday. They said Linick told lawmakers he was “shocked” by his firing on May 16 and that subsequent justifications weren’t true.After President Donald Trump fired Linick, part of a pattern of ousting agency inspector generals he considered insufficiently loyal, Pompeo confirmed that he had recommended the dismissal. He argued that Linick wasn’t working in sync with the State Department’s mission statement. Officials later said Linick hadn’t adequately addressed claims that his office leaked a report into political retribution under Pompeo and his predecessor Rex Tillerson.The State Department declined immediate comment. Republican lawmakers who participated in Wednesday’s interview didn’t challenge the Democrats’ account but said they still had unanswered questions about Linick’s alleged leaks, which were investigated by the Defense Department’s inspector general.“While today’s briefing did help to answer some questions, many more were left outstanding, including why the DOD IG’s investigation into Linick was ‘limited’ and why Linick withheld the DOD IG’s report from his superiors at State,” Leslie Shedd, a spokesperson for Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement.Pompeo has ridiculed reports that he was the subject of Linick’s investigations and told the Washington Post that he had no knowledge that the inspector general was looking into whether he and his wife had used diplomatic security agents to run personal errands and were at fault for other abuses of government funds.But Linick told lawmakers he had discussed the matter personally with Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun and Undersecretary for Management Brian Bulatao, and sought documents from Pompeo’s office.“He stated that his staff had these discussions so State Department leadership ‘would not be surprised,”’ the Democrats said.Linick said Pompeo refused his request for an interview about the emergency declaration for the Saudi arms deal after the inspector general insisted on the presence of a witness from the inspector general’s office.Although Pompeo repeatedly refused to answer questions from reporters on why he got Trump to fire the inspector general, he accused Linick in a May 28 interview with Fox News of leaking information and “investigating policies he simply didn’t like.”“This didn’t have anything to do with retaliation,” Pompeo told Laura Ingraham. “This was about an IG who was attempting to undermine the mission of the United States Department of State.”According to the Democratic lawmakers, Linick called Pompeo’s explanations “either misplaced or unfounded.” He accused Bulatao of “bullying” him by saying the Saudi investigation wasn’t appropriate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fired-watchdog-says-he-told-pompeo-aides-of-probe-into-spending/story-Vq6beB7imGDje0wyc1br1N.html

Defectors and other activists in recent weeks have used balloons to fly leaflets criticizing the North’s authoritarian leader Kim Jong Un over his nuclear ambitions and dismal human rights record.While Seoul has sometimes sent police officers to block such activities during times of high tension, it had resisted the North’s calls to fully ban them, saying the activists were exercising their freedoms.The shift followed remarks earlier in the morning from Kim’s powerful sister, who threatened to end the military agreement and said the North could permanently shut a liaison office and an inter-Korean factory park that have been major symbols of reconciliation.In her statement released through state media, Kim Yo Jong called the defectors involved in the balloon launches “human scum” and “mongrel dogs” who betrayed their homeland and said it was “time to bring their owners to account,” referring to the government in Seoul.Yoh Sang-key, spokesman of South Korea’s Unification Ministry, said the balloon campaigns were threatening the safety of residents living in the border area and that his government will push for legal changes to “fundamentally resolve tension-creating activities.”When asked whether the ministry would specifically express regret over the North’s threat to abandon inter-Korean agreements, Yoh said: “we will substitute our evaluation (of the North Korean) statement with the announcement of the government position (on the issue).”South Korea’s ruling liberal party and its satellite party have 180 seats in the 300-seat National Assembly after winning April’s elections, giving it a solid majority to win approval for the proposal in parliament.North Korea’s latest denouncement of the balloon protests follows months of frustration over the South’s unwillingness to defy US-led international sanctions against the North.Kim Yo Jong took a higher profile in North Korean affairs as part of her brother’s diplomatic efforts in 2018 and has been issuing her first public statements as that diplomacy has slowed in recent months. State media has carried her comments ridiculing Seoul for protesting a North Korean military drill but praising President Donald Trump for offering to help the North with anti-virus efforts.“(South Korean) authorities will be forced to pay a dear price if they let this situation go on while making sort of excuses,” she said in advocating South Korea outlaw the balloon protests.“If they fail to take corresponding steps for the senseless act against the fellow countrymen, they had better get themselves ready for possibility of the complete withdrawal of the already desolate Kaesong Industrial Park following the stop to tour of (Diamond Mountain), or shutdown of the (North-South) joint liaison office whose existence only adds to trouble, or the scrapping of the (North-South) agreement in military field which is hardly of any value.”In a separate statement, the international affairs department of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party accused U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of spewing “rubbish” over his critical comments toward Beijing, which is Pyongyang’s biggest ally.In a Fox News interview on Sunday, Pompeo said the Chinese Communist Party was putting Americans at risk because it has come to “view itself as intent upon the destruction of Western ideas, Western democracies, Western values.”The department’s unidentified spokesman also commented on the intensifying protests in the United States over the death of George Floyd, saying that the unrest exposes harsh realities in America.“Demonstrators enraged by the extreme racists throng even to the White House. This is the reality in the U.S. today. American liberalism and democracy put the cap of leftist on the demonstrators and threaten to unleash even dogs for suppression.”Seoul has touted the military agreement, reached during the third summit between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, as a major step in the peace process.The Koreas had agreed to jointly search for human remains from the 1950-53 Korean War and take steps to reduce conventional military threats, such as establishing buffer and no-fly zones. They also removed some front-line guard posts and jointly surveyed a waterway near their western border to allow freer civilian navigation.However, the North has been less enthusiastic about upholding inter-Korean agreements as the larger nuclear talks with the U.S. stalemate. North Korea has suspended virtually all cooperation with the South, while also pressuring Seoul to break away from Washington and restart the joint economic projects, which would breathe life into the North’s broken economy.“If they truly value the (North-South) agreements and have a will to thoroughly implement them, they should clear their house of rubbish,” said Kim Yo Jong, who’s considered her brother’s closest confidant.The liaison office in Kaesong has been closed since late January after the Koreas agreed to temporarily shut down until the coronavirus outbreak is controlled.The North has also postponed plans to tear down South Korean-made hotels and other facilities at the North’s Diamond Mountain resort as part of its virus-prevention efforts. It has said there hasn’t been a single case of Covid-19 on its territory, a claim widely disbelieved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seoul-vows-to-stop-border-protests-after-pyongyang-s-threat/story-wXTwTh2D9Guiywn6YDWlvJ.html
04-06-2020||World||Hackers group targets California University leading Covid-19 research||A group of hackers with a history of targeting healthcare organizations executed a successful ransomware attack this week on the University of California, San Francisco.UCSF confirmed it was the target of an “illegal intrusion” but declined to explain which portion of its IT network may have been compromised. Researchers at the university are among those leading American antibody testing and clinical trials for possible coronavirus treatments, including a recent study on anti-malarial drugs touted by President Donald Trump as a possible remedy, then refuted by scientists.The university has alerted security experts and law enforcement of the attack, which didn’t affect its patient care operations, said Peter Farley, a director of communications at UCSF.“With their assistance, we are conducting a thorough assessment of the incident, including a determination of what, if any, information may have been compromised,” Farley said in a statement. “In order to preserve the integrity of the investigation, we will need to limit what we can share at this time.”Read more: Malaria Drug Taken by Trump Provides No Covid-19 ProtectionThe NetWalker hackers claimed credit for the attack on their darkweb blog. The post dedicated to UCSF appeared to be copy and pasted from the university’s home page promoting its work on healthcare.Attack groups often post data samples to prove the success of their breach. In this case, their blog posted four screenshots, including of two files accessed by the attackers. The files’ names, seen by Bloomberg on the darkweb, contain possible references to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and departments central to the university’s coronavirus research.The blog includes a flashing-red timer threatening “secret data publication” by June 8 Pacific Time if payment isn’t received. The post doesn’t mention the value of ransom demanded.In most ransomware cases, payment is followed by the exchange of a decryption key that allows victims to gain access to their files. When victims don’t pay, which is often the case when they have backup copies to restore their data, attack groups sometimes publish the most sensitive data in hopes of coaxing payment.Hackers are increasingly targeting institutions like UCSF not only for ransomware payments themselves, but also for possibly lucrative intellectual property, like valuable research on a cure for Covid-19. UCSF has engaged in extensive sampling and anti-body testing, including on the experimental anti-viral drug remdesivir, which has shown signs of being effective early in the Covid-19 life-cycle.The US was hit by a record volume of ransomware attacks in 2019 and attackers have shown little sign of relenting in 2020, when users spent more time on less secure networks while working from home. In 2019, at least 966 government agencies, schools and healthcare providers were attacked at a cost of more than $7.5 billion, according to the cyber research firm Emsisoft. Among those were almost 90 universities.Netwalker ransomware was first introduced and operated by the criminal cyber group dubbed Circus Spider by CrowdStrike Inc. Since September 2019, Netwalker ransomware has been actively used by criminal actors with links to malware including Mailto, Koko, and KazKavKovKiz.“The use of Covid-19 lures and targeting entities in the healthcare sector indicate that the operators of Netwalker are taking advantage of the global pandemic in order to gain notoriety and increase their customer base,” according to a Crowdstrike research report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hackers-group-targets-california-university-leading-covid-19-research/story-QBUs0BNqnAlM00C96aMr0L.html
04-06-2020||World||Trump confronted defense chief Esper over comments on protests||President Donald Trump confronted his Defense secretary, Mark Esper, after the Pentagon chief publicly opposed the idea of deploying the military to contain protests, according to people familiar with the matter.Separately, the president later asked top advisers if they thought Esper could still be effective in his position, two people familiar with the discussions said on Wednesday night.At a news conference in the afternoon, the president’s press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, tiptoed around whether Esper’s job was safe, saying only that he remained in his post.Neither the White House nor the Pentagon immediately responded to requests for comment on Wednesday night.Esper met with Trump in the Oval Office after telling reporters at the Pentagon that active-duty military forces to perform law enforcement within the US is “a matter of last resort” and that the National Guard was better-suited to the task.On Monday, Trump had threatened to send military forces to cities and states that fail to quell violence spiraling from protests over the death in Minneapolis last week of a black man in police custody.The defense chief also appeared to back away from his boss by saying that while he knew he would be joining Trump to walk into Lafayette Square in front of the presidential residence on Monday, he was not aware of specific plans, including what would happen when the group reached St. John’s Episcopal Church.Trump has been criticized by religious leaders and Democrats, as well as some Republicans and former military officials, for the visit to the historic church, where he stood briefly holding up a Bible after security forces cleared peaceful protesters from the area using pepper balls and smoke cannisters.Esper said at the Pentagon on Wednesday that he thought he would be reviewing damage in the plaza and at the church, but wasn’t briefed on a specific plan since he was called back to the White House after heading toward a command center at the Department of Justice.“I did know we were going to the church. I did not know a photo op was happening,” Esper said.His remarks generated irritation at the White House, where three Trump aides who asked not to be identified said the secretary should have moderated his comments to draw less of a distinction with the president.Later Wednesday, a blistering denunciation of Trump by his first Defense secretary, Jim Mattis, was published by The Atlantic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-confronted-defense-chief-esper-over-comments-on-protests/story-Z611AwIdghYA0GZ1P54UrN.html
04-06-2020||World||George Floyd tested positive for Covid-19 in April: Report||George Floyd, the African-American, who died in police custody last month, had tested positive for the coronavirus in April, according to the medical examiner’s report.A report in The New York Times (NYT) cited the full autopsy released by the Hennepin County medical examiner and said that the 46-year-old had tested positive for the coronavirus on April 3.The county’s top medical examiner Andrew Baker said that the Minnesota Department of Health had swabbed Floyd’s nose after his death and he had tested positive for the virus, the NYT report said.The positive result at the time of his death was likely a lasting positive result from his previous infection, it said.The report added that there is no indication that the virus played any role in his death.Protests across New York and the US intensified as thousands of demonstrators took to the streets demanding an end to police brutality after Floyd was killed when a white police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes while he lay handcuffed and pinned to the ground gasping for breath on May 25.“Please, I can’t breathe,” were Floyd’s last words and have become a clarion call for the protesters demanding action against police brutality.Former New York City medical examiner Michael Baden, who was among two doctors who conducted a private autopsy for Floyd’s family last week, said county officials did not tell him that Floyd had tested positive for Covid-19.“The funeral director wasn’t told, and we weren’t told, and now a lot of people are running around trying to get tested,” Baden said.“If you do the autopsy and it’s positive for the coronavirus, it’s usual to tell everyone who is going to be in touch with the body. There would have been more care,” he said.Baden has said that the four police officers who arrested Floyd should also get tested for Covid-19 as should some of the witnesses.“I’m not angry,” he said in the NYT report. “But there would have been more care.” Baden added in the NYT report that the full autopsy includes information he did not have access to, such as the toxicology results showing. Floyd had fentanyl in his system.Baden said that when he conducted the autopsy report, a part of the heart was not provided — the part that showed coronary artery disease.Forensics expert at John Jay College of Criminal Justice Lawrence Kobilinsky said he was struck by the difference between the county’s official autopsy and the results of Baden’s private autopsy.Kobilinsky said defense lawyers could make a point of the amount of fentanyl in Floyd’s body. The NYT report said while the amount required to be lethal varies from person to person, fentanyl can stop a person’s heart and breathing.“It seems to me, it’s high enough where a defense attorney would argue that this kind of predisposes him to heart failure, when you are on a drug like this,” Kobilinsky said.Baden has acknowledged that the amount of fentanyl in Floyd’s body was “considerable,” which would be particularly important if he had never used the drug before.“He has enough that could be a cause of death if he had never had immunity or tolerance to the drug,” Baden said in the NYT report adding that “restraint is what caused the death.” According to the Johns Hopkins University data, there are more than 1.8 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the US with over 107,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-tested-positive-for-covid-19-in-april-report/story-3F3xLHxI4FrSMIFXotP8yK.html
04-06-2020||World||James Mattis takes charge of US military pushback to President Donald Trump||Former US defence secretary James Mattis joined White House protesters in spirit on Wednesday with a stinging rebuke of Donald Trump’s handling of the protests calling him the only President in his lifetime “who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try”.Mattis is the first former Trump cabinet member to come out so publicly to criticise the president. He also joins a growing list of past and present top defence leaders who have either explicitly criticised Trump or distanced themselves from him for using US military personnel against protesters, specially those who brutally swept aside demonstrators to make way for the President’s now-infamous photo-op at a church, with a copy of the Bible in hand.“Donald Trump is the first President in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us,” Mattis wrote in a statement to The Atlantic, a news publication. “We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort.”“We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership,” he added. Mattis is a highly regarded marine general who Trump loved talking up before they fell out over difference on Syria in the winter of 2018. He was also one of the most bullish of US defence secretaries on closer defence ties with India. He took it upon himself to personally pilot an exemption clause for India, though not explicitly, from a US law that sanctions countries for large defence purchases from Russia.Mattis’ statement came just hours after Mark Esper, his successor at the Pentagon, tried to distance himself from the use of US military personnel against protesters and, more specifically, from the use of force to disperse peaceful demonstrators from Lafayette Square so that Trump and his entourage could walk unmolested to a nearby church for a photo-op to counter uncharitable media coverage of the President taking shelter in the White House underground bunker on the first night of protests.“The option to use active duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort, and only in the most urgent and dire of situations,” Esper told reporters. “We are not in one of those situations now.“I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act,” he added in a significant departure from the US President’s open advocacy of the 200-year-old law to force states to allow US military forces.Former chairman of the US chiefs of staff Mike Mullen wrote the day before in a piece titled “I cannot remain silent”, also in The Atlantic, “I remain confident in the professionalism of our men and women in uniform. They will serve with skill and with compassion. They will obey lawful orders. But I am less confident in the soundness of the orders they will be given by this commander in chief, and I am not convinced that the conditions on our streets, as bad as they are, have risen to the level that justifies a heavy reliance on military troops. Certainly, we have not crossed the threshold that would make it appropriate to invoke the provisions of the Insurrection Act.”Other past US military leaders have spoken out as well recently. But Mattis, or someone with matching clout in the military was the voice that was awaited to unlock the frustration said to have been building up in the forces against the flagrant politicisation of one of the most respected of US institutions.Trump acknowledged the mounting pushback from US military establishment, when he tried to cut down Mattis, belittling him. “Probably the only thing Barack Obama & I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world’s most overrated General,” he wrote in a tweet.“His primary strength was not military, but rather personal public relations. I gave him a new life, things to do, and battles to win, but he seldom ‘brought home the bacon’. I didn’t like his “leadership” style or much else about him, and many others agree. Glad he is gone!”But can Trump turn the tide?A new fence outside the White House has kept protesters further away than before, and some more. But it has not deterred them from showing up in larger numbers. They sit around, sing, chant slogans and occasionally fling two-word expletives in the direction of the White House, too far away to matter.They were entirely peaceful. As were protesters in New York city, largely, and other parts of the country. Protesters have been policing themselves. They try and prevent those among them that try to break into stores, or violently confront law enforcement officers, and destroying property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/james-mattis-takes-charge-of-us-military-pushback-to-president-donald-trump/story-cBHh5NVcXyNpX3gBFKAGtK.html
04-06-2020||World||Covid-19: Canada’s Supreme Court to hold virtual hearings||The Covid-19 pandemic is ringing in systemic changes in the manner in which the branches of Government in Canada operate. The country’s Supreme Court has announced that it will, for the first time in history, start virtual hearings. That came as the Speaker of Canada’s House of Commons, equivalent of the Lok Sabha, said technology was in place for start remote voting.The Canadian Supreme Court has released a list of matters that it will hear via video conferencing starting next week. In a statement, Chief Justice Richard Wagner said, “While the Covid-19 pandemic has forced us to close our building to physical visitors for everyone’s health and safety, it hasn’t stopped us from doing our work. We may not be able to welcome members of the public to our physical courtroom, but we are excited to invite everyone to our virtual courtroom for the first time.”These hearings will be live-streamed on the court’s website, and the platform that will be used for the purpose will also make provisions for observers to “view” the proceedings as they would in the actual court chambers in Ottawa.As the Supreme Court is going virtual, Canada’s House of Commons may soon allow its members to vote on matters like legislation. Speaker Anthony Rota told a House Committee that they were “technically ready for virtual voting.”The country’s Parliament was adjourned in March due to the coronavirus crisis, but special sittings related to the combating the disease and the various facets of its impacts have taken place. Some were in person, with a minimum number of MPs in attendance, others were done remotely. Late last month, these focused sittings transitioned to “hybrid” sessions, with MPs joining in remotely while some were present in the chamber.The virtual vote could become a reality by the end of this month, as a spokesperson for the Government’s Leader in the House Pablo Rodriguez told the agency Canadian Press that they were “100 per cent in favour of electronic voting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-canada-s-supreme-court-to-hold-virtual-hearings/story-i8ta5cUsnf2rAVYD5lNnBL.html
04-06-2020||World||Tiananmen anniversary marked by crackdown, Hong Kong vigil ban||China tightened controls over dissidents while pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong and elsewhere sought ways to mark the 31st anniversary Thursday of the crushing of the pro-democracy movement centered on Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.That came after authorities in Hong Kong took the extraordinary move of canceling an annual candlelight vigil in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory for the first time in 30 years.Authorities cited the need for social distancing amid the coronavirus outbreak, despite the recent reopening of schools, beaches, bars and beauty parlors. Hong Kong has had relatively few cases of the virus and life has largely returned to normal in the city of 7.4 million.However, China has long detested the vigil, the only such activity allowed on Chinese territory to commemorate victims of the crackdown, which remains a taboo subject on the mainland. Hundreds, possibly thousands of people were killed when tanks and troops assaulted the center of Beijing to break up weeks of student-led protests seen as posing a threat to authoritarian Communist Party rule.The cancellation also comes amid a tightening of Beijing’s grip over Hong Kong, with the National People’s Congress, China’s ceremonial parliament, moving to pass national security legislation that circumvents Hong Kong’s local legislature and could severely limit free speech and opposition political activity.In Hong Kong, a law is being passed to make it a crime to disrespect China’s national anthem and 15 well-known veteran activists were arrested and charged with organizing and taking part in illegal demonstrations. Those actions are seen as part of a steady erosion of civil rights Hong Kong was guaranteed when it was handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997.“The ban comes amid an alarming acceleration of attacks on the autonomy of Hong Kong and the undermining of the rights and freedoms of the Hong Kong people guaranteed under Hong Kong and international law” Sharon Hom, executive director of Human Rights in China, said in a statement.Despite the ban on the vigil, the Asian financial hub was bracing for “pop-up” protests of the type that raged around the city during months of anti-government protests last year that often led to violent confrontations between police and demonstrators.Thousands have been arrested over the demonstrations, which were sparked by proposed legislation that could have seen suspects extradited to mainland China where they could face torture and unfair, politically biased trials.The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic and Democratic Movements of China that organizes the annual vigil has called on people around the city to light candles at 8 p.m. (1200 GMT) and plans to livestream the commemorations on its website www.64live.org.Other vigils, virtual and otherwise, are planned elsewhere, including in Taiwan, the self-ruled island democracy whose government called again this year for Beijing to own up to the facts of the crackdown.That drew a strong response from Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian, who called the statement “complete nonsense.”“As to the political disturbance that occurred in the late 1980s, the Chinese government has had a clear conclusion. The great achievements that we have achieved ... have fully demonstrated that the development path China has chosen is completely correct, which conforms to China’s national conditions and has won the sincere support of the Chinese people,” Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo marked the crackdown anniversary on Tuesday, a day after federal forces used tear gas to clear peaceful protesters from a park in front of the White House.Pompeo tweeted criticism of China and Hong Kong for banning the vigil before meeting privately with a group of Tiananmen Square survivors at the State Department. That too drew criticism from China.Alongside the exchanges of rhetoric, China’s small, beleaguered dissident community has again come under greater scrutiny from the authorities. Many have been placed under house arrest and their communications with the outside world cut off, according to rights groups.China has released the last of those arrested for directly taking part in the Tiananmen demonstrations, but others who seek to commemorate them have been rearrested for continuing their activism.They include Huang Qi, founder of website 64 Tianwang that sought to expose official wrongdoing. Reportedly in failing health, he is serving a 12-year-sentence after being convicted of leaking state secrets abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiananmen-anniversary-marked-by-crackdown-hong-kong-vigil-ban/story-RONVhqehqGfGBTPxVLQZ3N.html

The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said in a statement that qualifying foreign carriers currently barred from operating flights to mainland China will be allowed once-per-week flights into a city of their choosing starting on June 8.Hong Kong and Macau, though part of China, have their own aviation authorities and set their own rules. US President Donald Trump’s administration has barred Chinese passenger carriers from flying into America starting June 16 as it pressures Beijing to let US airlines to resume flights to the country.The CAAC in late March said Chinese airlines could maintain just one weekly passenger flight on one route to any given country and that carriers could fly no more than the number of flights they were flying on March 12. But because US passenger airlines had stopped all flights by March 12, they have been unable to resume flights to China. The CAAC also said all airlines will be allowed to increase the number of international flights involving China to two per week if no incoming passengers on their flights test positive for Covid-19 for 3 consecutive weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-eases-foreign-flight-curbs-after-us-order-targets-chinese-carriers/story-wxMsIW6RtkPw3uuE1UpCsI.html
04-06-2020||World||Amid anti-racism protests after George Floyd’s death, NFL star Drew Brees’ remarks trigger row||National Football League (NFL) star Drew Brees said he would not support renewed kneeling protests on Wednesday, saying to do so would be “disrespecting the flag” of the United States.When asked about the ongoing protests, Brees told Yahoo Finance, “I will never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States of America or our country.”“When I look at the flag of the United States, I envision my two grandfathers, who fought for this country during World War II, one in the Army and one in the Marine Corp.“Is everything right with our country right now? No, it is not. We still have a long way to go.Brees is the NFL’s all-time passing yardage leader and one of the biggest names in the sport.As a wave of protests against police brutality and racism sweeps across the US, many athletes have voiced support for former NFL star Colin Kaepernick, who ignited controversy in 2016 by kneeling during the US national anthem.Although the kneeling controversy largely subsided in recent NFL seasons, the issue of player activism has returned following the US protests triggered by the death in police custody last week of George Floyd, an unarmed African-American man in Minneapolis.NBA superstar LeBron James, former NBA player Stephen Jackson, and even many of Brees’ teammates slammed him for the comments.“Is it still surprising at this point. Sure isn’t!” James said on Twitter. “You literally still don’t understand why Kap was kneeling on one knee?? Has absolute nothing to do with the disrespect of (the flag) and our soldiers(men and women) who keep our land free. My father-in-law was one of those.”Jackson, who was friends with Floyd and has become one of the leading voices of protestors, also ripped into Brees.“Bad timing, Drew Brees. Bad timing, bruh. All right? You play for New Orleans and you live in New Orleans. All them black people in New Orleans support you. Drew Brees, you gotta be a little more sensitive to the timing,” he said in a video.Brees’ public comments were his first following the death of Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25. In the week since, thousands have protested in cities throughout the US, with police often clashing with protesters and looters.Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, was arrested last week and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. A second-degree murder charge against him was added Wednesday. He had pressed his knee on the neck of Floyd, a black man, for more than eight minutes.Three other former Minneapolis police officers were charged Wednesday with abetting Chauvin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-anti-racism-protests-after-george-floyd-s-death-nfl-star-drew-brees-remarks-trigger-row/story-COIt6d2Y39rCT9eWYyBJaM.html

Morelli issued a statement in which he said he is “ashamed of my comments and behavior” and acknowledged his participation in “Facebook trolling.”Morelli had told police on Monday that someone had gained access to his Facebook account to post racist comments about Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. An investigation determined that Morelli made the comments, police said.Police have not disclosed the nature of Morelli’s comments beyond that they were about Floyd.

04-06-2020||World||Wuhan tests 10 million people, only 300 test positive for Covid-19||The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected late last year, has tested nearly 10 million people in an unprecedented 19-day campaign to check an entire city.It identified just 300 positive cases, all of whom had no symptoms. The city found no infections among 1,174 close contacts of the people who tested positive, suggesting they were not spreading the virus easily to others.That is a potentially encouraging development because of widespread concern that infected people without symptoms could be silent spreaders of the disease.“It not only makes the people of Wuhan feel at ease, it also increases people’s confidence in all of China,” Feng Zijian, vice director of China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told state broadcaster CCTV.There is no definitive answer yet on the level of risk posed by asymptomatic cases, with anecdotal evidence and studies to date producing conflicting answers.Wuhan was by far the hardest hit city in China, accounting for more than 80% of the country’s deaths, according to government figures.A city official announced Tuesday that the city completed 9.9 million tests from May 14 to June 1. If those tested previously are included, virtually everyone above the age of 5 in the city of 11 million people has been tested, said Li Lanjuan, a member of a National Health Commission expert team.“The city of Wuhan is safe,” she said at a news conference with city officials.The campaign was launched after a small cluster of cases was found in a residential compound, sparking concern about a possible second wave of infections as Wuhan emerged from a 2 1/2 month lockdown.The industrial city on the Yangtze River in central China spent 900 million yuan (about $125 million) on the tests, the official Xinhua News Agency said. It quoted Executive Deputy Mayor Hu Yabo as saying the cost was “totally worthwhile” to reassure residents, lifting a “psychological lockdown.”Clarence Tam, an assistant professor of public health at the National University of Singapore, called the results reassuring but said more information is needed about the value of this kind of mass screening when the risk is already low.He noted that the tests, while generally accurate, sometimes give a positive result for uninfected people, and the very low number in Wuhan was well within the range of expected error.“As more countries adopt mass screening strategies, a challenge will be to try and minimize the chances of detecting false positives,” Tam said in an email response to The Associated Press. “This has some implications, because in Wuhan for example, those who tested positive and more than 1,000 of their contacts were quarantined.”The rapid testing of so many people was made possible in part through batch testing, in which samples from up to five people are mixed together, Xinhua reported. If the result is positive, then the people are individually tested.National resources were also mobilized to help, said Wang Weihua, deputy director of the Wuhan Health Commission, according to Xinhua. Together, these efforts raised Wuhan’s daily testing capacity from 300,000 to more than one million, she was quoted as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-tests-10-million-people-only-300-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-K8XOkHdXho1MGn6wgdCqEK.html

It wants them banned, but Seoul refuses and says the activists and defectors are exercising free speech.In her statement released through state media, Kim Yo Jong called those defectors “human scum” and “mongrel dogs” who betrayed their homeland and said it was “time to bring their owners to account,” referring to the government in Seoul.“(South Korean) authorities will be forced to pay a dear price if they let this situation go on while making sort of excuses,” she said.“If they fail to take corresponding steps for the senseless act against the fellow countrymen, they had better get themselves ready for possibility of the complete withdrawal of the already desolate Kaesong Industrial Park following the stop to tour of (Diamond Mountain), or shutdown of the (North-South) joint liaison office whose existence only adds to trouble, or the scrapping of the (North-South) agreement in military field which is hardly of any value.”In a separate statement, the international affairs department of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party accused U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of spewing “rubbish” over his critical comments toward Beijing, which is Pyongyang’s biggest ally.In a Fox News interview on Sunday, Pompeo said the Chinese Communist Party was putting Americans at risk because it has come to “view itself as intent upon the destruction of Western ideas, Western democracies, Western values.”The department’s unidentified spokesman also commented on the intensifying protests in the United States over the death of George Floyd, saying that the unrest exposes harsh realities in America.“Demonstrators enraged by the extreme racists throng even to the White House. This is the reality in the U.S. today. American liberalism and democracy put the cap of leftist on the demonstrators and threaten to unleash even dogs for suppression.”South Korea’s government didn’t immediately react to Kim Yo Jong’s comments.It has touted the military agreement, reached during the third summit between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, as a major step in the peace process.The Koreas had agreed to jointly search for human remains from the 1950-53 Korean War and take steps to reduce conventional military threats, such as establishing buffer and no-fly zones. They also removed some front-line guard posts and jointly surveyed a waterway near their western border to allow freer civilian navigation.However, the North has been less enthusiastic about upholding inter-Korean agreements as the larger nuclear talks with the US stalemate. North Korea has suspended virtually all cooperation with the South, while also pressuring Seoul to break away from Washington and restart the joint economic projects, which would breathe life into the North’s broken economy.“If they truly value the (North-South) agreements and have a will to thoroughly implement them, they should clear their house of rubbish,” said Kim Yo Jong, who’s considered her brother’s closest confidant.The liaison office in Kaesong has been closed since late January after the Koreas agreed to temporarily shut down until the coronavirus outbreak is controlled.The North has also postponed plans to tear down South Korean-made hotels and other facilities at the North’s Diamond Mountain resort as part of its virus-prevention efforts. It has said there hasn’t been a single case of Covid-19 on its territory, a claim widely disbelieved.Kim Yo Jong’s comments follow months of frustration over the South’s unwillingness to defy U.S.-led international sanctions against the North and resume South Korean tours at the site.After years in her brother’s shadow, Kim Yo Jong emerged as part of her brother’s diplomatic efforts in 2018. She was the first member of the North’s Kim dynasty to travel to the South for the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in February 2018. She took her place among global dignitaries before conveying to Moon her brother’s desire for a summit.As regional diplomacy has slowed in recent months due to the coronavirus, she has been issuing her first public statements, ridiculing Seoul for protesting a North Korean military drill but praising President Donald Trump for offering to help the North with anti-virus efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-spars-with-neighbour-over-balloons-bringing-in-anti-kim-leaflets/story-TNOKFzxr9d01WXu8CFp3vL.html
04-06-2020||World||PM Modi to hold virtual summit with Australian PM Scott Morrison today||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold India-Australia Virtual Summit with Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday to focus on the positive trajectory in bilateral relations.“Dates for the visit of Prime Minister of Australia to India this year had been finalised, but the visit could not take place. It was also agreed to hold a ‘Virtual Summit’. This is the first time that Prime Minister Modi will be holding a “Bilateral Virtual Summit”, this signifies the strengthening of ties with Australia and its upward trajectory,” Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement.“The focus would be on the positive trajectory in bilateral relations during discussions between the two Prime Ministers, who have already met on four occasions on the sidelines of multilateral meetings,” sources said.“The virtual summit will be an opportunity for the two leaders to review the broad framework of the relationship in the context of their growing ties. It will also be an opportunity to discuss their respective responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of MoUs and announcements are being discussed by the officials,” they added.Modi and Morrison have met four times during the last one and a half years -- on the sidelines of East Asia Summit in Singapore in November 2018, on the sidelines of G20 in Osaka in June 2019, on the margins of G7 Summit in Biarritz in August 2019 and on the margins of East Asia Summit in Bangkok in November 2019.“India and Australia have very warm and friendly relations. The two nations have much in common, underpinned by shared values of pluralistic, Westminster-style democracies, Commonwealth traditions, the long-standing people-to-people ties and sporting links. Our economies have many complementarities with the potential to enhance bilateral trade and investment,” sources said.The Strategic Partnership between the two countries was strengthened in 2014 - with the visit of Prime Minister Tony Abbott to India in September 2014, and the visit of PM Modi to Australia in November 2014.Framework for Security Cooperation between Australia and India signed in November 2014 during the visit of PM Modi to Australia laid the foundation for intensified foreign, defence and security policy exchanges between the two countries. Since then, regular meetings of the institutional dialogues have been taking place, MEA said.High-level interactions have also continued. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, visited India in April 2017; the Governor-General of Australia visited India in March 2018 to attend the founding Summit of the International Solar Alliance and Rashtrapatiji made a historic visit to Australia in November 2018, MEA said.Due to a better understanding of India’s strength and future role, Australia, in its White Paper on Foreign Policy-2017, recognised India as the “pre-eminent maritime power among Indian Ocean countries” and a “front-rank partner of Australia”.During the last five years, bilateral relations between both countries have strengthened and expanded tremendously. Framework for security cooperation between Australia and India signed in November 2014 during the visit of Modi to Australia laid an action plan on foreign, defence and security policy exchanges and coordination, sources noted.“Several new initiatives and bilateral/trilateral mechanisms such as Foreign Secretaries and Defence Secretaries 2+2 Dialogue, India-Australia-Indonesia Trilateral Dialogue, India-Australia-Japan Trilateral Dialogue have been established since then. These new platforms have provided greater momentum to strengthen our strategic cooperation,” they added.Moreover, economic engagement has been growing. In 2018-19, the trade between the two countries was around USD 21 billion. Australia’s cumulative investment in India is about USD 10.74 billion whereas India’s total investment in Australia is USD 10.45 billion, MEA added.Australia has been supportive of India’s position on cross-border terrorism and on asking Pakistan to take meaningful action against terrorist groups operating from its soil. Australia also co-sponsored UNSC resolution to declare Masood Azhar a global terrorist, sources said.“Australia values India’s diversity and inclusiveness and has held the view that recent developments with regard to Jammu and Kashmir are India’s internal matters,” they added.There is a 700,000 strong Indian diaspora in Australia. There are about 1,06,000 students studying in Australia. Under the Vande Bharat Mission, 1,560 Indian nationals and five OCI cardholders were evacuated from Australia in seven flights in the second phase of the initiative in May this year.The Virtual Summit will be an opportunity for the two leaders to review the broad framework of the relationship, in the context of growing ties between India and Australia, and to discuss their respective responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, MEA said.

04-06-2020||World||‘Facing results of three years of immature leadership’: Mattis rips into Trump||Ex-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis condemned his former boss, President Donald Trump, over his aggressive rhetoric and strategy to quell protests that erupted after the death of an unarmed black man in police custody.“Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people — does not even pretend to try. Instead, he tries to divide us,” Mattis, a retired Marine general, wrote in a scathing statement on Wednesday evening.“We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership. We can unite without him, drawing on the strengths inherent in our civil society,” Mattis wrote. “This will not be easy, as the past few days have shown, but we owe it to our fellow citizens; to past generations that bled to defend our promise; and to our children.”The sharply worded and unprecedented rebuke from Trump’s first defense chief will raise pressure on the president, who this week threatened to dispatch active duty troops to quash protests and drew widespread condemnation when the square in front of the White House was forcibly cleared before he walked to a historic church to hold a Bible for photographers.The president responded Wednesday evening saying that he “didn’t like his ‘leadership’ style or much else about” Mattis. “His primary strength was not military, but rather personal public relations,” Trump wrote in one of a pair of tweets.Mattis stepped down 18 months ago after Trump abruptly announced on Twitter that he wanted to pull US troops from Syria, but he was a hugely influential member of the president’s first national security cabinet.Trump was so eager to unveil his nomination of Mattis after the 2016 election that he announced his plans at a campaign-style rally where he introduced the former head of US Central Command by a moniker -- “Mad Dog” -- and called him “one of the most effective generals that we’ve had in many, many decades.”Mattis’s statement, first published in The Atlantic, came on what had already been a rough day for the defense establishment.Trump’s current secretary, Mark Esper, angered White House officials by publicly distancing himself from Trump’s potential use of the 1807 Insurrection Act to deploy active duty forces to cities confronting protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.At a news conference in the afternoon, the president’s press secretary tiptoed around whether Esper’s job was safe, saying only that he remained in his post.While Trump has condemned police for their role in Floyd’s death, he has generally avoided directly responding to demands to address racial injustice and a spate of deaths of black Americans at the hands of police. Instead, he demanded that governors “dominate” the protests to snuff them out and compared himself to Abraham Lincoln, musing that perhaps only Lincoln had done as much for black Americans as he had.It remains to be seen if Mattis’s denunciation will have lasting political power, but it strikes at the heart of what the president has pitched as one of his strengths: His fulsome praise of the military as part of his “America First” approach to the world, even while he frequently accuses the national security establishment of trying to undermine him and his administration.Despite Trump’s praise of Mattis when he took office, by the end of the defense chief’s tenure, their relationship was shattered. Upon his departure, Mattis he issued a blunt resignation letter that amounted to a public reproach of Trump’s “America First” mantra.“We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances,” Mattis wrote. “Because you have the right to have a secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.”Shortly afterward, Trump lashed out at Mattis, saying “What’s he done for me?” Singling out the U.S. quagmire in Afghanistan, Trump added, “How has he done in Afghanistan? Not too good.”In his statement this week, Mattis took aim at Esper, too. Without naming the Pentagon chief, but citing the military jargon the Defense secretary and other top officials have used in describing the geography of the current protests, Mattis said, “We must reject any thinking of our cities as a ‘battlespace’ that our uniformed military is called upon to ‘dominate.”’Esper had used the “battlespace” term during a call with governors on Monday, before US authorities used smoke bombs and pepper-spray-like devices to clear out the peaceful protest outside the Whiet House.“We know that we are better than the abuse of executive authority that we witnessed in Lafayette Park. We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution,” Mattis wrote.Around the time Mattis’s statement was published, Trump was renewing his threat to send in the military to quash protests, during an interview on Newsmax with Sean Spicer, his former press secretary. He called continuing protests in New York a “disaster.”“And we could help them a lot, they have to ask,”Trump told Spicer. “If they don’t get it straightened out soon, I’ll take care of it.”White House and Pentagon officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Mattis’s statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facing-results-of-three-years-of-immature-leadership-mattis-rips-into-trump/story-Xvqw9fpmLGWiwOWa79zciJ.html

Two dozen flights will depart from Toronto, while the remaining two will take off from Vancouver.India’s High Commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria was hopeful that these departures will manage to “accommodate” most of those with “urgent needs” to return to India this month.Also read: 75 more flights to US, Canada in Vande Bharat Phase 3This is the second phase of repatriation flights from Canada under the Modi government’s Vande Bharat Mission. All flights are being operated by Air India.In May, five flights left from Toronto and Vancouver, carrying back 1,343 Indians. This phase, announced by Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, is part of the 75 flights scheduled from United States and Canada.More cities in India have been added in this phase. While Delhi will remain the hub, passengers will be able to travel to the cities of Chennai, Kolkata, Lucknow and Trivandrum, which did not figure in the May schedule. Those flights connected several other cities including Amritsar, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Jaipur.This will also be the first time that Overseas Citizen of India or OCI card holders in distress will also be able to fly to India since they were not eligible in the month of May. Relaxation of Government rules for OCIs have meant that some may qualify for these flights.As with the initial phase of repatriation, Air India flights departing from India will also be taking registrations from Canadian citizens and permanent residents wishing to return back to Canada. As Puri pointed out earlier, 1,417 flew out of India in the first phase. Air India will start accepting reservations for the Canada-bound flights on June 5.Also read: India adds over 140 flights to West Asian nations in Phase 2 of Vande Bharat MissionBisaria said that nearly 8,000 persons had registered for the repatriation flights on the Indian High Commission’s website and after the first phase, approximately 6,500 remained. These 26 flights should be sufficient to ferry the majority of them. He also pointed out that with the announcement of these flights, there may well be more registration in the days ahead.However, passengers will have to be prepared for the mandatory 14-day quarantine period once they arrive at their destination in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vande-bharat-mission-26-flights-to-depart-from-canada-from-june-9-to-june-30/story-qeOLjdHiYB5QKaCqkrPuKI.html

It follows President Donald Trump’s announcement on Friday of retaliatory measures against Beijing over its tightened grip on Hong Kong.The designations are expected to include China Central Television (CCTV), the top state-owned network, and China News Service, the country’s second-largest state-owned news agency, two sources said on condition of anonymity.They would be added to five Chinese outlets placed under restrictions in February over US allegations they were used by China and its Communist rulers to spread propaganda.Like the others, they will be required to register their employees and US properties with the State Department, similar to rules covering embassies and other diplomatic missions.Though three sources said the announcement was on track for as early as Thursday, a fourth did not rule out a delay.The White House and State Department did not respond to requests for comment. There also was no response from the Chinese embassy in Washington.Tensions between Washington and Beijing have spiked, as Trump and his aides have complained about China’s early handling of the coronavirus outbreak and its treatment of Hong Kong, which has enjoyed special US treatment as a global financial center.Chinese state media has been reveling over chaotic race-related protests in the United States and highlighting Trump’s threat to use troops, even as the anniversary looms of its own bloody military crackdown on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square 31 years ago.Hong Kong tensionsTrump on Friday ordered his administration to begin the process of eliminating special US treatment for Hong Kong on the grounds it no longer had enough autonomy, but stopped short of calling an immediate end to former British colony’s privileges. China’s state-run Global Times newspaper called Trump’s announcement “recklessly arbitrary.” The United States and China have clashed in recent months over journalists working in each other’s countries.Michael McCaul, top Republican on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said: “These are Chinese Communist Party propaganda outlets that peddle dangerous information to grow the Party’s power -- not report the news.”In February, the Trump administration said it would treat five major media entities with US operations the same as embassies: Xinhua News Agency, China Global Television Network, China Radio International, China Daily Distribution Corp. and Hai Tian Development USA, Inc.In March, Washington said it was slashing the number of journalists allowed to work at US offices of major Chinese media outlets to 100 from 160 due to Beijing’s “long-standing intimidation and harassment of journalists.”In response, China said it was revoking accreditations of American correspondents with the New York Times, News Corp’s Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post whose credentials expire by the end of 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-impose-restrictions-on-additional-chinese-media-outlets-sources/story-225GqiFMzS0HmgTP9FFW2M.html

It also said it recorded 28,633 new cases in the last 24 hours, pushing the country’s total to 584,016, behind only the USClick here for full Covid-19 coverageThe nation of 210 million people has become an epicenter of the virus, and health experts say the peak of the disease has yet to arrive. Still, after about two months of loosely enforced quarantines, some regions of the country have begun to reopen from lockdowns, including Sao Paulo, which has been the epicenter of cases in the country. On Wednesday, the local government said cases in the state could reach 265,000 by the end of the month, from about 118,000 currently.Contradicting orders from municipal, state and federal leaders have complicated efforts to fight the virus, which has migrated to inland and poorer regions less equipped to deal with the pandemic.The government of President Jair Bolsonaro has resisted social distancing efforts throughout the pandemic, with Bolsonaro often mingling with supporters and pushing for people to get back to work to ease the economic fallout of the crisis. On Wednesday, data showed Brazil’s industrial output fell the most on record in April, adding to historic drops in indicators from formal jobs to broad retail sales that reflect the shutdown from the virus.Also on Wednesday, Rio de Janeiro Governor Wilson Witzel said the state was taking over management of field hospitals being built to help cope with the pandemic. Local media have reported problems ranging from delays to mismanagement in the makeshift structures. Last week Witzel, a political rival of Bolsonaro, had his official residence searched by police and his mobile phones and computers seized as part of an investigation into misuse of funds to fight the coronavirus pandemic.With winter approaching the Southern Hemisphere, the country is entering a period of increased cases of respiratory diseases, further adding to concern that the peak may still be weeks away. The Health Ministry said last week that the curve of cases was still growing, and a report by UBS published Wednesday said that six of Brazil’s 27 states are peaking, while total deaths are increasing in 21 states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-reports-record-daily-covid-19-deaths-as-pandemic-spreads/story-8dNfGAHMXHx05hAygIagVM.html

It led to long queues around the Westminster complex on Tuesday during a vote.Lisa Nandy, shadow foreign secretary, described Sharma’s situation as “just awful”, and added, “The government stopped MPs from working from home and asked us to return to a building where social distancing is impossible.

American liberalism and democracy put the cap of leftist on the demonstrators and threaten to unleash even dogs for suppression.”South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said it was the first time the WPK international affairs department had issued a statement of its own since North Korean leader Kim Jong Un took power in 2011.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extreme-racists-throng-even-to-white-house-north-korea-on-protests-in-us/story-ZYC21OqL0klFWz5pSxIcnJ.html

No,” the New Yorker said. “It’s going to take radical change” in policing and the criminal justice system, she said.Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was critical of the police response on prior nights, said the city Tuesday “was much, much better than the night before.”“It worked. We got results,” Cuomo said. “Let’s just remember what we did last night and keep that going.”De Blasio rejected President Donald Trump’s urging and Cuomo’s offer to send in the National Guard to quell the unrest, saying the NYPD was best suited for the task and fearing out-of-town Guardsmen unfamiliar with city dynamics could spark confrontations.Trump warned that if the city didn’t maintain order, he would take the matter into his own hands, though he didn’t say what action he might take.“If they don’t get their act straightened out, I will solve it. I’ll solve it fast,” he said on FOX News Radio’s The Brian Kilmeade Show.Hundreds of protesters were in Manhattan’s Washington Square Park when the charges against the other officers were announced.“It’s not enough,” protester Jonathan Roldan said, contending all four officers should’ve been charged from the start. “Right now, we’re still marching because it’s not enough that they got arrested. There needs to be systematic change.”The curfew, barring people from streets citywide and nonessential vehicles from part of Manhattan from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m., was imposed to prevent the nighttime chaos that followed peaceful protests for several days in a row.Around Manhattan, even in parts of the city that hadn’t seen the damage and thefts, businesses had boarded up windows as precautions.Vandalism and pilfering didn’t stop completely Tuesday. Some shops had windows smashed and merchandise taken. But it was a contrast from the previous two days, when several Manhattan shopping districts and one in the Bronx were overrun with people — some with crowbars and clubs — who ransacked numerous shops and set fires.Moving the curfew from 11 p.m., where it had been Monday, as well as blocking vehicles from entering Manhattan, allowed police to take control of city streets and remove troublemakers, Chief of Department Terence Monahan said.The curfew did not stop political demonstrations over police mistreatment of black Americans. Marchers chanted slogans as they wound through Manhattan and Brooklyn deep into the night Tuesday. The marches were part of a wave of protests across the country since the May 25 death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.The nightly curfews will remain in effect at least through Sunday, with the city planning to lift it at the same time it enters the first phase of reopening after more than two months of shutdowns because of the coronavirus.Police said they arrested about 280 people on Tuesday, compared with 700 the previous night. In all, more than 2,000 people have been arrested, the NYPD said.Wednesday, prosecutors also charged a man with shooting at an occupied police vehicle in Queens. Neither officer in the vehicle was wounded. No demonstration was underway in the area and the man’s motive in shooting at the vehicle was unclear.City officials have said, without offering much evidence, that out-of-town agitators have been responsible for the majority of attacks on police officers seen over the last few days and that many involved in removing items from store shelves weren’t protesters, but organized groups that used vehicles to scout locations and remove stolen property.In a tweet Wednesday, Shea claimed “organized looters” had positioned bricks in plastic tubs around the city to use in their crimes. But City Councilman Mark Treyger noted the bricks in the video Shea tweeted were from a construction project far from where any protests or violence had occurred.Shea said some people are “using the protests as cover and then peeling off and unfortunately running around and doing some looting.”De Blasio condemned police for roughing up journalists covering the protests, including two from The Associated Press who were shoved, cursed at and told to go home by officers Tuesday night despite press being considered “essential workers” allowed to be on the streets.“There should be no condition under which any journalist is detained by the police of this city or any city in the United States of America, period,” de Blasio said, calling for an investigation.Shea said officers were “doing the best we can under difficult circumstances,” adding that some people stopped by police lied about being journalists.“Sometimes these things take a second, maybe too long, to sort out,” he said. “We’re not perfect, we do the best we can in a situation.”The police commissioner had planned to appear together with Floyd’s brother Wednesday at a Brooklyn church, but Terrence Floyd decided shortly before the event began that he was too overcome to attend, organizers said. Shea said he’d offered his condolences to Floyd on the phone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-takes-step-forward-in-restoring-order-says-mayor/story-LVahf96xLBcEhSr8JeDo1N.html
04-06-2020||World||Germany agrees $146 billion stimulus package as Europe jobless rise||Germany’s governing parties agreed on a 130 billion euro (USD 146 billion) stimulus package Wednesday to help kick-start the economy, which like others around the world has taken a heavy hit from the coronavirus pandemic.Following 21 hours of talks over two days, Chancellor Angela Merkel said members of her left-right coalition had come up with a “bold response” that would boost consumer spending, invest in innovation and ease the financial strain on families and others.Germany started loosening coronavirus restrictions April 20, about a month after they were introduced, and the easing has gathered pace since. However, the economy went into a recession in the first quarter and the downturn is expected to deepen in the current quarter.Unemployment rose to 6.3% from 5.8% over the past month, a figure that would have been significantly higher had it not been for a government program that allowed companies to cut back the hours and wages of more than 7 million employees in return for keeping them on.“It’s clear that all of this requires a bold response,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin. “It’s about securing jobs, keeping the economy running or getting it going again.” The stimulus package will see the main value-added tax rate cut from 19% to 16% and the reduced rate from 7% to 5% for six months, starting July 1.Debt-laden municipalities will receive financial aid from the federal government, which will shoulder 120 billion euros of the overall package covering the years 2020 and 2021.And families will receive a 300 euro payment per child, with further support for single parents.Among dozens of other measures, the government will extend aid to sectors that have been particularly badly hit by the pandemic, increase financial incentives for electric and hybrid vehicles, fund the expansion of childcare facilities and see greater government investments in areas such as renewable energy storage, quantum computing and digitalization.Germany already is offering a total of more than 1 trillion euros in aid via various packages, which include money to tide small companies and individual entrepreneurs through virus-related closures and to pump capital into bigger companies where needed.The crisis has derailed the government’s dedication to keeping its budget balanced, long a point of pride. After six years in the black, it is borrowing 156 billion euros to finance the existing rescue packages and cover an expected shortfall in tax revenue.Olaf Scholz, the country’s finance minister, said Germany could afford to increase government spending “because we’ve been financially prudent in recent years and can draw on savings.” Asked whether there was a danger that Germany’s notoriously frugal consumers might take the government’s stimulus measures as an opportunity to buy a cheaper French car, Merkel said: “We have an interest in Germany being strong, but in particular that Europe is also strong overall.” Germany is heavily reliant on exports and a pullback by its main trading partners could hurt the economy badly.New figures released Wednesday by the statistics agency Eurostat showed the jobless rate in the 19 countries that use the euro rose to 7.3% in April, the first full month when pandemic lockdowns hit the continent, from 7.1% in March.Europe’s rise in unemployment has been moderate by international standards because employers are making extensive use of government-backed short-time work programs, which allow them to keep employees on the payroll while they await better times.In Germany, Europe’s largest economy, the federal labor agency pays at least 60% of the salary of employees who are on reduced or zero hours.In the United States, which has fewer automatic furlough programs than Europe, the jobless rate has rocketed to almost 15% from 4% before the crisis, and new figures due Friday are expected to show a further increase to nearly 20% in May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-agrees-146-billion-stimulus-package-as-europe-jobless-rise/story-blSbLPwpFU56JIaYMStkbK.html
04-06-2020||World||US defense chief opposes deploying troops to quell protests||US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Wednesday he does not support invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy active-duty forces to quell civil unrest for now, despite President Donald Trump’s threats to militarize America’s response to mass protests.Trump said this week he could use military forces in states that fail to crack down on sometimes violent protests over the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis.“The option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations. We are not in one of those situations now,” Esper told a news briefing.“I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act.”Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who had long refused to criticize a sitting president explicitly, on Wednesday accused Trump of trying to divide America and roundly denounced a militarization of the US response to civil unrest.Esper’s news conference did not go over well with either the president or his top aides, an administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.To deploy the military on US soil for law enforcement purposes, Trump would need to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act - something last done in 1992 in response to the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.The military has pre-positioned 1,600 active duty forces on the outskirts of Washington, D.C., to deploy if needed.A US official said that the Army on Wednesday had been told of a decision to send some of the active duty troops back to their home base, but Esper reversed course following a meeting at the White House and discussions at the Pentagon. Esper said he regretted using the term “battlespace” this week to describe areas gripped by protests.“In retrospect, I would use different wording so as not to distract from the more important matters at hand or allow some to suggest that we are militarizing the issue,” he said. Trump’s threats to deploy active duty troops -- even in states that oppose its use to address civil unrest -- has stirred alarm within the US military and in Congress, where a top Republican warned it could easily make troops “political pawns.”Esper said he was unaware that he would be part of Trump’s politically charged photo opportunity on Monday, when law enforcement forcibly cleared a park outside the White House of peaceful protesters so that the president could take a picture in front of a church holding a Bible. Mattis, a retired Marine general who denies political ambitions, also took a swipe at current US military leadership for participating in the Monday photo-op and criticized use of the word “battlespace” by Esper and Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.In his press conference earlier, Esper acknowledged the difficulty of deploying the military without entering the political fray.“I work very hard to keep the department out of politics, which is very hard these days as we move closer and closer to an election,” Esper said.Retired Navy Admiral Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he was “sickened” to see how law enforcement -- including the National Guard -- had cleared the area and warned against over-use of the US military.“Our fellow citizens are not the enemy, and must never become so,” Mullen wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-defense-chief-opposes-deploying-troops-to-quell-protests-despite-trump-threats/story-LTBlnXBFoCpRPPcEQ1SujO.html
04-06-2020||World||‘Trump completed hydroxychloroquine regimen safely’: White House medical team||The White House medical team kept a close eye on President Donald Trump’s heart rhythms, including at least one electrocardiogram, to watch for potential side effects when he took a two-week course of a malaria drug to try to prevent the coronavirus, his doctor reported Wednesday.“The President completed the regimen safely and without side effects,” Dr. Sean Conley wrote in a report on Trump’s latest physical and his treatment with hydroxychloroquine.Overall, Conley said, Trump showed little change in basic health measurements from 16 months ago. On the negative side, he gained a pound. But on the plus side, his cholesterol level continued to fall.“The data indicates the President remains healthy,” Conley concluded.Trump recently took a two-week course of hydroxychloroquine after two White House staffers tested positive for Covid-19.Conley said it was done in consultation with “appropriate care team members and close monitoring of the electrocardiogram (EKG),” indicating that doctors were looking for changes in his heartbeat because abnormal heart rhythms are one of the dangerous side effects that have been found in studies of the drug.The drug proved ineffective for preventing Covid-19 in the first large, high-quality study to test it in people in close contact with someone with the disease. Results published Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine show that hydroxychloroquine was no better than placebo pills at preventing illness from the coronavirus. The drug did not seem to cause serious harm, though -- about 40% on it had side effects, mostly mild stomach problems.Trump has frequently has cited anecdotal reports and seemed determined to prove the naysayers wrong.Trump’s weight came in a 244 pounds. That gives him a Body Mass Index of 30.5, based on his 6-foot, 3-inch frame. An index rating of 30 is the level at which doctors consider someone to be obese. About 40 percent of Americans are obese.Trump was evaluated twice for the physical, first in November 2019 and then in April. He has a resting heart rate of 63 beats per minute. A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute, and generally, a lower rate implies better cardiovascular fitness.His blood pressure came in at 121 over 79. The American Heart Association says an elevated blood pressure range is when a reading for the upper number consistently ranges from 120-129 and less than 80 for the lower number. People with elevated blood pressure are likely to develop high blood pressure unless steps are taken to control the condition.Trump has shown marked improvement in his cholesterol levels during his presidency, helped by medication. At his physical in January 2018, his total cholesterol was 223. In early 2019, the reading came in at 196. It now stands at 167. The president takes Rosuvastatin to help lower his bad cholesterol, known as LDL, and to raise his good cholesterol, or HDL. Ideally, total cholesterol should be less than 200.Trump also takes aspirin daily and Finasteride, a drug to treat enlargement of the prostate and male pattern hair loss. Aspirin reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke in people at high risk for them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-completed-hydroxychloroquine-regimen-safely-white-house-medical-team/story-DDlKJk5ZZf6K8KS5dl0S4L.html
04-06-2020||World||Police chokeholds being scrutinised around the world||Three days after George Floyd died with a Minneapolis police officer choking off his air, another black man writhed on the tarmac of a street in Paris as a police officer pressed a knee to his neck during an arrest.Immobilisation techniques where officers apply pressure with their knees on prone suspects are used in policing around the world and have long drawn criticism. One reason why Floyd’s death is sparking anger globally is that such techniques have been blamed for asphyxiations and other deaths in police custody beyond American shores, often involving non-white suspects. “We cannot say that the American situation is foreign to us,” said French lawmaker Francois Ruffin, who has pushed for a ban on the police use of face-down holds that are implicated in multiple deaths in France, a parliamentary effort put on hold by the coronavirus pandemic. The muscular arrest on May 28 in Paris of a black man who was momentarily immobilised face-up with an officer’s knee and upper shin pressing down on his jaw, neck and upper chest is among those that have drawn angry comparisons with the killing of Floyd.In Hong Kong, where police behaviour is a hot-button issue after months of anti-government protests, the city’s force says it is investigating the death of a man who was immobilised face-down during his arrest in May by officers who were filmed kneeling on his shoulder, back and neck.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-chokeholds-being-scrutinised-around-the-world/story-kOuJ5JJWdBO7Wc9NhQGNWJ.html

She said China was compelled to take the step at the national level because of the opposition in Hong Kong legislature.On Wednesday, a spokesperson from the EU said Hong Kong people must be free to mark the Tiananmen Square crackdown anniversary, which police had banned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-plan-to-give-sanctuary-to-hk-citizens-angers-china/story-YylOnR0CkIVAzpVjtDUjTI.html

04-06-2020||World||One face in the crowd: A protester haunted by the dead||She couldn’t eat and she couldn’t sleep, jolting awake an hour after going to bed. Kelly Bundy felt haunted by the people who died by police bullets, or had an officer’s knee on their neck.She could hear her grandmother screaming when police gunned down their family friend, 19-year-old Michael Newby, in a 2004 killing that scarred this city. That was 16 years ago, but suddenly it felt like yesterday, and like nothing had changed since. The list has only grown, in Louisville and beyond: Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Freddie Gray, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd.“It’s almost if I’m being haunted by them because I’m not doing enough,” Bundy said, so she got out of bed after two hours of sleep and headed out to the streets for her third day of protest.The unrest has engulfed cities across America in honor of George Floyd, who died after an officer pressed his knee into in his neck while he pleaded for air in Minnesota; Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT who was shot in Louisville by detectives knocking down her door in the middle of the night; and other African Americans. Tens of thousands of people protest nightly, in dozens of cities and towns, touching every state. They raise signs, chant for justice, and repeat the names of those lost.Much of the focus has been on burning buildings and police cruisers, smashed windows, fireworks tossed at officers. Bundy and her friends say they know the truth: Most protesters are peaceful people like them, who feel called to duty after a lifetime of inequality, the everyday indignities of racism, the enduring fear of police aggression.In every crowd, like this one of thousands packed into a downtown square, there are gig workers like Bundy, who bartends, delivers groceries, and hosts a radio show; there are nurses and lawyers, pastors, a fashion designer, a model, a comedian, an employee of the mayor’s office.Louisville police, like others, have dispersed crowds with tear gas and pelted protesters with pepper balls. Military vehicles block streets, and officers in riot gear with batons break up demonstrations at dusk. Helicopters circle overhead. Early Monday morning, a new round of fiery resistance ignited in Louisville, when David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue restaurant, was killed while police and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew.On Monday morning, Bundy, 30, and her friends packed cases of water and snacks to distribute to fellow demonstrators; they brought a first aid kit and milk to pour into the eyes of people tear gassed. Authorities keep telling everyone to go home and be safe. But Breonna Taylor was shot in her own home, Bundy said, so that doesn’t make much sense: “I could get killed at home because of the color of my skin. Where are we safe? What difference does it make, being out here or going home?”The recent unrest is the most acrimonious confrontation between police and protesters here since the 2004 killing of Newby, who was shot in the back by Officer McKenzie Mattingly. Mattingly was fired and indicted, then acquitted by a jury.Bundy was 13, and she recalls her grandmother flipping on the news, hearing the name of the dead young man and wailing. Bundy’s grandmother’s best friend was Newby’s mother. The phone started ringing. “They killed our boy,” the callers cried.“I thought to myself, ‘He’s black, I’m black, it could happen to me, too,” she said.Today, many Louisville protesters say the Newby killing turned them into activists. It was the day Bundy saw clearly how America would work against her all her life.There are the everyday injustices: impoverished neighborhoods, lack of health care, underperforming schools. Then there’s the overzealous policing: When she was 17, she said, she was leaving a nightclub with friends, and a group of white women taunted them about their clothes, how they shouldn’t be in the neighborhood. Officers arrived, and they assumed the young black women were the aggressors. One slammed her to the ground, Bundy said. Most black people she knows have some experience like this, and it feels to her now like that anger is irrevocably boiling over.The protests have been traumatizing, and she thinks she’ll cope with that the rest of her life. The first day, she was terrified. Her family begged her not to go: “You’re going to get killed, your name will be the next hashtag.” She didn’t even get out of her car. But she couldn’t get the sound of her grandmother screaming out of her head. She couldn’t eat, or drink, or sleep.She went back the next day. She got tear gassed just as she stepped out of her car, she said, and a friend poured milk in her eyes. She watched officers fire nonlethal projectiles at her friends. She thought of her three children, and wondered whether one day they’d have to go through this, too, like her parents and grandparents and now her.“That made me want to go even harder,” she said. “They’re not going to silence me. They’re not going to stop me.”The next day, she stood in the front of the crowd, holding a sign high: “George Floyd.” She led hundreds as they marched, stopping traffic. Most cars honked, and drivers thrust their fists in the air in solidarity. A group of officers met them in the city square, and some demonstrators hugged them. Bundy did not. She said she wasn’t ready yet.As the sun set, the clock ticked toward curfew and police in riot gear lined up a block way, she headed home, with plans to return again in the daylight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-face-in-the-crowd-a-protester-haunted-by-the-dead/story-V31aJyA8DCClW3dN1tPcoJ.html
04-06-2020||World||US protests more peaceful, defense secretary breaks with president||An eight-feet tall fence greeted protestors at the White House Tuesday, aimed at keeping them further away from the seat of American power, but it failed to deter them from showing up in even larger numbers. They stayed late, chanting slogans and singing, in defiance of night-time curfew.Protestors in New York city also stayed on the streets till late in clear violation of a night-time curfew that started earlier that before. They had been largely peaceful but as it got late into the night, looting and violence broke out sporadically, but not on the scale seen the previous night.More than two dozen American cities such as Washington DC, New York City, Los Angeles were under various durations of curfew as protests and demonstrations continued across the United States in support of justice and against persisting racism, triggered by the death of George Floyd, an African unarmed American man, in police custody in Minneapolis last week.“I want justice for him because he was good, no matter what anybody thinks,” Roxie Washington, the mother of Floyd’s six-year-old daughter, told told reporters at a press conference in Minneapolis on Tuesday, breaking down uncontrollably at time.s. “He was good and this is the proof that he was a good man,” she added, pointing at their daughter Gianna.Protests at the White House and the Trump administration’s overwhelming response to them, with implications for the rest of the country, have come under special scrutiny. Specially in the light of the action taken by law enforcement agencies to clear a park teeming with protestors Monday to make way for the president to walk to a nearby stage with an entourage of cabinet members and senior officials to stage a photo-op.US defense secretary Mark Esper on Wednesday sought to further clear his role in this incident and the use of US military reservists of the National Guard by the Trump administration to quell the violence accompanying the protests in some parts with a strategy to “dominate” the streets.“I don’t support invoking the Insurrection Act,” Esper said in first public comments, referring to a 200-year-old law the president has sought to invoke to deploy active-duty troops against the protests. He added, in a significant break with the president, “The option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort and only in the most ... dire of situations. We are not in one of those situations now.”But on Tuesday, the Pentagon moved 1,600 additional troops to the Washington DC area. But it stressed, in a statement from the the spokesman, ”Active duty elements are postured on military bases in the National Capitol Region but are not in Washington, DC. They are on heightened alert status but remain under Title X authority and are not participating in defense support to civil authority operations.”US military police personnel have been standing by deployment in New York, at the request of local officials, who have so far not only held off on calling in either them or the National Guard reservists, despite repeated public calls from the president, a former New Yorker .New York city fared much better Tuesday than the night before . “So far, the curfew is certainly helping, based on everything I’ve seen in Brooklyn and Manhattan over the last three hours,” he wrote on twitter late int he evening. But some disturbances were reported after, once again, nothing comparable the previous day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-protests-more-peaceful-defense-secretary-breaks-with-president/story-nopGvE4qBFlq8rrr1TBOmK.html
04-06-2020||World||First 100 ventilators donated to India to be shipped next week: Donald Trump||The United States expects to ship the first tranche of 100 ventilators, out of 200 machines it plans to donate to India, by next week, President Donald Trump told Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a phone conversation. Trump had first announced the plan to donate the ventilators through a tweet on May 16, when he said the two sides were also working on developing a vaccine for Covid-19. The donation of the ventilators figured during President Trump’s phone call to PM Modi on Tuesday, and the president said he was “happy to announce that the US would be ready to ship the first tranche of 100 donated ventilators to India next week,” according to a White House pool report. The two leaders also discussed the upcoming G7 Summit in September, the Covid-19 response of the two countries and regional security issues. President Trump invited PM Modi to attend the G7 Summit. Ramona El Hamzaoui, acting director of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in India, had told reporters last month: “This is a donation. The US government plans to donate 200 ventilators to India.”She added, “USAID, on behalf of the US and through the generosity of the American people…is providing access to medical supplies and ventilators to India and other countries.”USAID has been working with India’s health ministry, the Indian Red Cross Society and other stakeholders in both countries to assist in the delivery, transportation and placement of the ventilators.The US government, private companies, and non-profit and academic organisations have shared their expertise with partner countries such as India on the production of ventilators and other equipment.USAID has so far announced $5.9 million in funding for India to combat Covid-19, including $2.9 million to provide care to the affected, disseminate information, contact tracing and surveillance, and $3 million to support a financing facility that can mobilise private sector resources to assist more than 20,000 health facilities enrolled under India’s health insurance scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-100-ventilators-donated-to-india-to-be-shipped-next-week-donald-trump/story-MyKjtJbMxelySngXiyMRHI.html

04-06-2020||World||Over 2,700 arrests since George Floyd protests in Los Angeles: Police chief||More than 2,700 people have been arrested since protests and violence began in Los Angeles in response to the death of George Floyd.Chief Michel Moore told the city Police Commission on Tuesday that about 2,500 of those arrests were for failure to disperse or curfew violations.The remainder were for crimes including burglary, looting, assaults on police officers and other violence, chief told the panel, which functions as the Police Department’s civilian oversight board.A huge new demonstration filled streets in the Hollywood area, with police and National Guard troops on scene.Earlier, police officers took a knee with clergy-led demonstrators near the downtown police headquarters where speakers urged everyone to heed the call of Floyd’s family for people to protest peacefully.Other major cities including San Francisco and San Diego also were calm.Los Angeles County, however, announced its 10 million residents would again be under curfew starting at 6 pm. Other jurisdictions around the state also renewed curfews.The full impact of curfews on the ability to police downtown Los Angeles and other areas of the city was evident by Sunday night, Moore said on Monday.Violence and thefts on Monday were not on the scale of the weekend, when blocks of stores were devastated, police cars torched and officers injured.In Sacramento, where two-thirds of downtown businesses were damaged over the weekend, 500 National Guard troops were deployed and the city imposed a Monday night curfew.Most demonstrations were peaceful and sympathy was expressed by law enforcement. Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco took a knee at the invitation of demonstrators.“We support and will protect those who wish to demonstrate peacefully,” U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna in Los Angeles said while announcing the FBI will help identify people who commit serious crimes.San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit said Floyd’s death prompted him to revisit department policy and stop the use of a controversial neck restraint method. Floyd, who was black, was handcuffed and on the ground pleading for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck for several minutes.Most of Monday’s demonstrations ended when curfews took effect. But remaining crowds tossed fireworks and bottles in several cities, and authorities responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.Police who had been overwhelmed during the weekend were reinforced by 4,500 National Guard troops.“Don’t be dumb,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti warned before the night’s curfew went into effect.Even so, scattered attacks on stores threatened to overshadow the message of protesters. Televised images showed attacks on stores in Van Nuys and Hollywood. Police said some people carried hammers.At one point, a handful of protesters stopped would-be thieves from entering a Walgreens on Sunset Boulevard.Many of the trashed businesses had only recently reopened after closures due to the coronavirus. Volunteers turned out to help merchants clean up broken glass, board up storefronts and scrub away graffiti.Alex Rose clutched a garbage-picker as he joined others cleaning up downtown Sacramento.“There’s a very clear distinction between protesters and the looters,” said Rose, who protested during the day Sunday. “I went home last night, and that’s when the criminals came out.”Some leaders blamed outsiders for the violence.Oakland’s acting police chief said organized thieves travelled more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) from other cities.“Fifteen, 20, 30 cars at a time, hitting as you’ve seen different shopping malls, different areas,” Chief Susan Manheimer said.San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott said some people “came to this city with crowbars, bolt cutters, tools that were designed specifically to get into businesses, to take property and loot.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-2-700-arrests-since-george-floyd-protests-in-los-angeles-police-chief/story-RHyyC5ZT1jtclAoST8D5PM.html
04-06-2020||World||Thousands set to attend George Floyd march in Houston||Thousands of people are expected to participate in a citywide march here on Tuesday to express outrage over the death of African-American George Floyd and offer solidarity with his grieving family.Floyd, a 46-year-old restaurant worker from Houston, died in Minneapolis on Monday after a white police officer pinned him to the ground. Video footage showed the officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he gasped for breath, sparking widespread protests across the US. On Monday, an official postmortem declared Floyd’s death a homicide.The organisers of the march and Houston police expect a huge turnout on Tuesday and hope things remain peaceful.“Downtown should look like the Astros parade tomorrow (Tuesday),” said rapper and activist Trae tha Truth, a friend of Floyd, who is among the organisers of the march.Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner encouraged people to wear masks and social distance as much as possible. He also asked them to continue to be respectful.“This is a salute to George and an acknowledgment that he should not have died the way he did,” Turner said. “I hope people will honour George and not deface his name and his memory,” the mayor said.“I expect the march on Tuesday to be peaceful and respectful with the focus on George Floyd and his family,” he said during a press conference on Monday.Two prominent Houston rappers, Trae Tha Truth and Bun B, Mayor Sylvester Turner and Police Chief Art Acevedo will join the family of Floyd, in a march on Tuesday afternoon starting at downtown’s Discovery Green and ending at the City Hall.Turner stressed protesters should wear face coverings, bring hand sanitisers or gloves and remain six feet from others if at all possible.“For everyone that is going to be engaged in those crowds...you need to mask up and be respectful of not just yourself but of others.” Turner said the city has increased its law enforcement presence in preparation of Tuesday’s march and is “ramping up” for a large crowd.With the exception of some rioting, looting and over 400 arrests during the weekend protests, Turner said Houston protests have remained somewhat peaceful.“Houston has helped set an example for protests across the nation,” Turner said. “Police have made some arrests...but things have not gotten out of hand.” He also thanked the Houston police for their professionalism and firefighters for the support they have given being on the front lines. Turner said he gives a lot of credit to Trae tha Truth and Bun B for organising peaceful events and their efforts.“This is a salute to Floyd and an acknowledgment that he should have not died the way he did. This is our home and this is Floyd home,” he said.Meanwhile, the funeral of Floyd will take place in his hometown Houston on June 9 which is expected to be attended by thousands and will include a police escort. According to the media reports, legendary boxer, Floyd Mayweather, 43, will pay for George Floyd’s funeral services.Fort Bend Memorial Planning Center sources confirmed that Floyd’s family has accepted Mayweather’s offer to pay for the services.The Floyd family announced earlier on Monday that there will be services held in Minneapolis, North Carolina and Houston.The funeral arrangements for Floyd were announced on Monday at a news conference, where representatives for the Floyd family revealed the results of a private autopsy, which found that Floyd’s death while in police custody was a homicide.His death, the autopsy concluded, was caused by asphyxia from neck and back pressure that led to a lack of blood flow to the brain.Police chief Acevedo, who has marched with demonstrators and changed the Houston Police Department’s Twitter profile picture to an image of Floyd and the hashtag #JusticeForFloyd, said he offered to have his officers escort the body.“We’ve reached out to the family,” Chief Acevedo said and depending on their plans, if they need help with the movement of the body, we’ve offered to provide that security.” Governor Greg Abbott has issued a State of Disaster for all Texas counties “in the midst of violent protests that endanger public safety and threaten property loss and damage.” Under the declaration, Abbott can designate federal agents to serve as state peace officers.Major Texas cities including Houston, Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio were rocked by protests and demonstrations. As Dallas reports, the city enacted an overnight curfew in the central Dallas area that was in effect from May 31 through 6 am June 1.“Every Texan and every American has the right to protest and I encourage all Texans to exercise their First Amendment rights,” said Abbott, in the statement. “However, violence against others and the destruction of property is unacceptable and counterproductive. As protests have turned violent in various areas across the state, it is crucial that we maintain order, uphold public safety, and protect against property damage or loss,” he said.“By authorising additional federal agents to serve as Texas Peace Officers we will help protect people’s safety while ensuring that peaceful protesters can continue to make their voices heard,” he added.

04-06-2020||World||Keep your mouth shut: Houston police chief tells Trump over George Floyd protests||The police of the Houston city in the US state of Texas has advice for President Donald Trump after his comments to governors following the murder of an African American at the hands of a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Houston Police chief Art Acevedo’s reaction came after Trump, who last week tweeted “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” urged governors to get tough on the violent protests following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in police custody in Minneapolis. A white officer has been charged and three others fired.Widespread protests have raged all over the United States following George Floyd’s death on May 25, starting with Minneapolis. Protesters have attacked and vandalised stores as well as police property.“Let me just say this to the President of the United States, on behalf of the police chiefs of this country: Please, if you don’t have something constructive to say, keep your mouth shut,” Acevedo said while peaking to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.President Donald Trump in a video conference call with governors on Monday had called them “weak” for not being able to control the growing nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd, suggesting that they use the National Guard to “dominate” protesters.Trump also praised the National Guard response in Minneapolis, saying it “cut through [protesters] like butter” while calling on state leaders to adopt more brutal tactics to put down the uprisings.“You have to dominate. If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time. They’re going to run over you. You’re going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate,” Trump said on the call, according to reports.Acevedo also accusing Trump of putting men and women in their early 20s at risk.“This is not about dominating. It is about winning hearts and minds. And let’s be clear, we do not want to confuse kindness with weakness. We don’t want ignorance to ruin what we have managed to do to restore normalcy,” the Houston Police chief said.Acevedo quoted from the Hollywood film Forrest Gump, saying “if you don’t have anything to say, don’t say it.”“Because that’s the basic tenet of leadership and we need leadership now more than ever.. and it’s time to be presidential and not try to be like on The Apprentice. This is not Hollywood, this is real life and real lives at risk,” he said, referring to the popular reality show that starred Trump.Floyd, who was in handcuffs at the time, died after police officer Derek Chauvin ignored bystander shouts to get off Floyd and Floyd’s cries that he couldn’t breathe. The Minneapolis police officer was charged last week with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, and three other officers were fired. Bystander video showed Chauvin holding his knee on Floyd’s neck despite the man’s cries that he can’t breathe until he eventually stopped moving.A medical examiner on Monday classified Floyd’s death as a homicide, saying his heart stopped as police restrained him and compressed his neck, in a widely seen video that has sparked protests across the US.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/please-keep-your-mouth-shut-houston-police-chief-tells-us-president-trump-over-george-floyd-protests/story-SzvQ88N7627HxEADlNmczN.html
04-06-2020||India||Thousands to be evacuated as Bengal’s cyclone-hit villages brace for spring tide on June 6||Thousands of people living in the cyclone-hit villages of south Bengal will once again have to be evacuated and shifted to safer places, as the water level in the rivers is expected to rise by a few metres during the spring tide on June 6.The water will gush into the villages through the breaches in the embankments left behind by Cyclone Amphan inundating new areas. Saline water had gushed into the villages through these gaps destroying farmlands, ponds and huts. Cyclone Amphan had battered West Bengal on May 20. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee held a video conference with the top brass of the district administration on Thursday. She has directed officials to remain alert and evacuate people if necessary.“The spring tide will come on June 6. The water could gush in through the breaches in the embankments. Some embankments which were badly damaged may get washed away. The situation will worsen if there is rain. The district administration will have to evacuate people from vulnerable areas,” she added.Due to Cyclone Amphan, which had hit the Bengal coast on May 20, around 8.5 lakh people had to be evacuated and kept in storm and flood shelters. Many are yet to return home as several villages still remain inundated.“We are planning to evacuate around 20,000 villagers from the three blocks which have been hardest hit by Cyclone Amphan – Kultali, Gosaba and Patharpratima. But as it is a tide, the water level will start receding after a few hours,” said P Ulaganathan, district magistrate of South 24 Parganas.While high tide and low tide are daily occurrences, spring tides occur during new moon and full moon because of the gravitational pull of the sun and moon. The water level in rivers and seas reaches its peak during the spring tide.“More than 350 families are still staying under polythene sheets on village roads that are on higher grounds and are relatively safe. They have lost their houses in the cyclone. Villagers have been asked to move to the cyclone shelters for a few hours when the tide comes. Those who stay in very low lying areas may have to stay longer and the water may take time to recede,” said Debesh Mondol, MLA of Hingalganj area in North 24 Parganas, which was hit by the cyclone. Around 160 km of river embankments and four km of sea dykes have been damaged by Cyclone Amphan. The river and sea water had gushed in during the storm destroying around 11 lakh hectares of crop land. Tons of fishes were killed when saline water destroyed around 58,000 hectares of water bodies where sweet water fishes were reared.“We have already started alerting the villagers living in vulnerable and low lying areas along rivers and villages facing the sea. We will be shifting some of them to relief shelters on June 6. Food and drinking water is being stored,” said a senior official in East Midnapore district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thousands-to-be-evacuated-as-bengal-s-cyclone-hit-villages-brace-for-spring-tide-on-june-6/story-CikQHPlpYQRfotTuGkw5VK.html

04-06-2020||India||40 new cases take Goa’s Covid-19 tally to 166||A day after 47 people tested positive for Covid-19 in Goa, 40 new cases were reported on Thursday, the government said.Out of the 40 new cases, 32 were within the containment zone at the Mangor Hill locality of Goa’s port town of Vasco da Gama while eight were among those entering the state from Maharashtra. The new cases have taken Goa’s Covid-19 tally to 166 including 109 active ones.The state administration has begun intensive testing within the containment zone since Monday but is confident that the virus has not spread beyond the containment zone. Clock here for full Covid-19 coverage.“On the first day we collected 200 swabs of which 42 were positive. Yesterday we collected 353 swabs of which 32 are positive. So the number of tests is increasing but the number of positive cases is decreasing. Once we have the results of the 400 swabs we have collected today we will get a clearer picture,” Health Secretary Nila Mohanan said. The Health Department began testing in the immediate vicinity where the first symptomatic patients emerged as well as vulnerable patients and has begun to expand the radius of testing which has shown a lower incidence of the virus. Asked if it the entire Vasco town would need to be placed under lockdown, the Health Secretary said it wasn’t necessary given how the situation has developed so far. The Goa government has increased its testing capacity and is testing all incoming passengers to maintain the state’s status of a ‘safe zone’. Goa is now testing more than 1,000 people daily and the capacity is expected to double over the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/40-new-cases-take-goa-s-covid-19-tally-to-166/story-QCcC3OqFdPSLIH0ejpS4fP.html
04-06-2020||India||As Covid-19 cases rise, makeshift hospitals need to be set up: Centre tells SC||As India recorded a daily jump of over 8,000 coronavirus cases for the fifth day on Thursday, the Centre told the Supreme Court that a “large number” of makeshift hospitals will have to be built in the near future to accommodate the constant rise in the number of newly infected people. The Centre also contended that though hospitals are responsible for implementing the Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) activities, the final responsibility lies with the health care workers to protect themselves from COVID-19. It further said mandatory quarantine for 14 days after rostering duty of health care workers of 7/14 days is “not justified and warranted”. “It is most respectfully submitted that number of cases of COVID-19 are constantly increasing and at some point of time in near future, apart from existing hospitals, large number of temporary make-shift hospitals will have to be created in order to accommodate COVID-19 patients requiring admission, medical care and treatment,” the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said in a written affidavit. The affidavit was filed before a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M R Shah on a plea that questioned the Centre’s new Standard Operating Procedure(SOP) of May 15 for frontline Covid-19 health care workers by which it ended the 14-day mandatory quarantine for them. The court allowed petitioner and private doctor Dr. Arushi Jain’s counsels advocate Mithu Jain and Arjun Syal to file the rejoinder affidavit to the Centre’s reply within a week and posted the matter for June 12. The country registered a record single-day jump of 9,304 coronavirus cases on Thursday pushing the total tally to 2,16,919, while the death toll climbed to 6,075 with 260 new fatalities, according to the Union Health ministry. The number of active Covid-19 cases stood at 1,06,737, it said. The ministry in its reply affidavit said health care workers(HCW) are properly protected by Personal Protective Equipments(PPE) in workplace settings and carry no additional risk to their families or children. It said grievances raised by the petitioner alleging infirmities in the May 15 guidelines of the health ministry are completely presumptuous, vacuous, ill-founded and sans any empirical or medical evidence. Justifying its advisory and SOPs, the health ministry said it is a step in the right direction and that the guidelines emphasise the role of taking adequate preventive measures by all health care workers in the hospital setting against the likelihood of contracting infection at their work place. It added that the risk profiling of those exposed has been deliberated in detail in the technical body under the Directorate General of Health Services, the Joint Monitoring Group (JMG), which also has a representative of World Health Organisation(WHO). “This risk assessment approach is also in line with guidelines issued by Centre for Disease Control, Atlanta, USA that only high risk exposure needs to be quarantined for 14 days. Hence, mandatory quarantine for 14 days, after rostering duty of health care workers of 7/14 days is therefore not justified and warranted,” it added. The Centre submitted that to successfully create optimum infrastructure to provide best medical care to coronavirus patients it will also have to adequately address human resource issue for this envisaged surge capacity scenario. “Hence, conserving health care work force is the need of the hour in order to cater to the anticipated patient load in the hour of distress.” The ministry submitted that while the Hospital Infection Control Committee (HICC) in the health facility is responsible for implementing the Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) activities and for organising regular training for HCWs, the final responsibility lies with the worker to prevent infection and to protect himself or herself. The ministry further said it is also his/her responsibility to adequately train himself/herself and take all possible measures for preventing the infection and if adequate measures are scrupulously observed, the chances of of the health care workers contracting the infection would not be higher than that of any other person. “…It is submitted that the current pandemic of COVID-19 is unprecedented and there is no time tested and universally acceptable protocol pertaining to COVID-19 preparedness. “Furthermore, the biggest challenge to deal with this pandemic is that there are currently no proven therapeutics or vaccines or rapid point of care diagnostic tests, risk assessment and management protocols for COVID-19 and here are major research gaps in many other key areas of COVID patient and hospital management”, the ministry said. As per the advisory, quarantine of health care workers, other than the two categories -- in case of high exposure to Covid-19 and in cases of health care workers showing symptoms of Covid-19 -- is not warranted, the petitioner had said. On April 8, the apex court had observed that the doctors and medical staff are the “first line of defence of the country” in the battle against Covid-19 pandemic, and directed the Centre to ensure that appropriate PPEs are made available to them for treating coronavirus patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covid-19-cases-rise-makeshift-hospitals-need-to-be-set-up-centre-tells-sc/story-N6WmtOIv68PsfKMdHEEvpK.html

The Delhi chief minister initially appeared to distance himself from the buzz that suggests his party had reached out to the Amritsar East MLA. Kejriwal told the channel that he had “no idea” about reports that his party was in touch with Sidhu via interlocutor.But asked if Sidhu was welcome to the party, Kejriwal smiled, and said: “he is welcome”.The Delhi chief minister didn’t respond to a follow-up question. “Now you are talking of politics in times of corona(virus), I can’t even elaborate,” the chief minister said, promising to answer questions on politics on a later date.Navjot Sidhu had been sulking in the Congress for months before he finally announced his exit from the Amarinder Singh cabinet on July 14. Sidhu’s last message on the micro-blogging platform is to declare that he had vacated his ministerial bungalow. Then, Sidhu went into silent mode.When he launched a YouTube channel, Jittega Punjab (Punjab will win) in mid-March, it was seen as the first step towards his political resurrection.In one of the early videos, Sidhu announced a ‘dharm yudh’ against the state’s system for what he described as its “salvation”. The national lockdown that came a few days later did appear to have slowed down that process.But back home in Punjab, local reports indicate that he had stepped up his involvement with his constituents in Amritsar and beyond as well.The buzz about his possible shift came soon after. On and off social media, there is speculation that he was in touch with AAP via election strategist Prashant Kishor. Neither Sidhu nor Prashant Kishor have confirmed or denied the speculation.But for Sidhu, this wouldn’t be the first time that he has been reported to be looking at AAP as an option.In 2016 before he quit the BJP, his party of 12 years, Navjot Sidhu had received public invitations from AAP leaders in Punjab and Delhi to join their party.Sidhu, however, had surprised AAP leaders when word came that he would join the Congress. A party Awaaz-e-Punjab that he had launched, reportedly as a backup plan, fell apart soon after.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/he-is-welcome-says-aap-s-arvind-kejriwal-on-buzz-around-navjot-sidhu/story-BMOsTbB2sYCy6MTyuUdAmI.html
04-06-2020||India||Onus of paying full wage to staff on the employer: Govt||The Centre is committed to restarting industries and reviving the economy, the central government’s top law officer, attorney general (AG) KK Venugopal, told the Supreme Court on Thursday during the hearing of a case challenging the home ministry’s March 29 directive to employers to pay workers in full for the lockdown period.The directive had been intended to alleviate human suffering and will not come in the way of employers and employees negotiating the payment terms, the AG said.“Government of India is interested in economy restarting, industries restarting. It is for employers to negotiate with employees as to how much wage could be paid for lockdown period, we will not interfere,” Venugopal said.Industries, traders and their associations, which are the petitioners before the apex court in the case, countered by arguing that workers will not come to the negotiating table as long as the government notification mandating payment of full wages is in operation.“With the March 29 notification in place, no negotiation will be possible since workers will not come to negotiating table. We are as much citizens as the workers are”, senior counsel KV Viswanathan, who was appearing for the company B4S Solution Ltd, told the bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan.The bench also seemed to share the concerns of the employers, stating that mandating payment of full wages during the lockdown could have an adverse impact on the industries.“The notification directs payment of 100% of salaries. It could have been around 50 to 75%. Do you have the power to ask them to pay 100%,” justice Bhushan asked.The bench, which also comprised justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MR Shah, reserved its verdict, which will be delivered on June 12. The court also granted interim protection to employers directing that no coercive action be taken against them until the court delivers its verdict.“List for orders on June 12. In the meantime, no coercive action, against the employers shall be taken pursuant to notification dated March 29,” the order said.The contentious notification issued by the ministry of home affairs on March 29 stated that employers must pay wages in full to all their employees even if their establishments are closed because of the lockdown.“All the employers, be it in the industry or in the shops and commercial establishment, shall make payment of wages of their workers, at their work places on due date, without any deduction for the period their establishments are under closure during the lockdown”, clause (iii) of the MHA order said.Companies and associations approached the Supreme Court ,stating that the obligation to pay employees arises only when work is actually done.“An employer and employee have reciprocal promises whereby the right of an employee to demand salary is reciprocal to performance of work by such employee. The employer has a right to not pay if no work is done”, the plea by Hand Tool Manufacturers Association, an association of around 52 firms based out of Punjab, said.The AG told the bench that the directive was to ensure that workers in industries stayed put instead of migrating to their home towns/ villages during the lockdown. “The humanitarian grounds on which this order was issued should be considered. People were migrating in crores. They would have stayed put only if they were paid”, he said in defence of the government notification.Senior counsel Indira Jaising, who appeared for Angmenhanti Kashtakari Sangarsh Samiti, an umbrella coalition of informal workers, also supported the government directive, arguing that it was intended to protect workers who had been prevented from going to work by the authorities because of the pandemic.“If an authority prevents me from going to work, then that authority should ensure that I am protected. We have honoured the lockdown”, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/onus-of-paying-full-wage-to-staff-on-the-employer-govt/story-gZ8ir35z9vrMi7xlojq6pK.html

He also pointed out that he was not yet adult,” said Yunus Khan, senior sub-inspector at Mallital police station in Nainital.“The boy also alleged that when the girl’s side came to know that the boy was a minor they refused to marry. But later his father persuaded the girl’s side somehow for the marriage,” said.Khan said the boy also alleged that his father had threatened to kill him when he refused to marry the girl. “ We have registered an FIR against minor’s father under Prohibition Child Marriage Act’s section 3 (Child marriages to be voidable at the option of contracting party being a child) and section 10 ( whoever performs, conducts or directs any child marriage shall be punishable with rigorous imprisonment) and IPC section 506 (criminal intimidation),” he said.Khan said the marriage took place in Rampur area of UP and the police have registered a zero FIR in Nainital and sent the case to Rampur for investigation. “Further investigation and arresting would be conducted by Rampur police in UP,” he said.Dushyant Mainali, a senior advocate in Haldwani, said child marriage in this era is one of the serious crimes. “But the rare thing, in this case, is that the teenager himself complained about his father. This will set up an example for other youngsters who are forced into child marriage by their families.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/boy-16-files-fir-against-father-for-marrying-him-forcibly-to-20-year-old/story-LrTKsL27qrLciNQtg94dfO.html

The report, titled ‘State of India’s Environment in Figures 2020’, published by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) talks about the massive scale of the economic impact of the pandemic.According to the report, the global poverty level will rise for the first time in 22 years.“Fifty per cent of the global population is under lockdown or containment with little or no new income -- 40-60 million people would be living in extreme poverty in the coming months due to loss of income.“India will add 12 million more poor, the highest in the world, to its shattered population,” the report said.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageAccording to CSE Director General Sunita Narain, extreme weather events in the past four years have remained the topmost global economic risks.“The impact of this, coupled with our lopsided and bad development strategies, has been very severe on India’s poor. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic has now been added to these misfortunes, and we find that our poor are now fighting with their backs to the wall.“This is what CSE’s latest publication, the State of India’s Environment in Figures 2020, brings out clearly,” Narain said.The publication was released on Thursday at an online webinar attended by over 300 participants.On COVID-19, the report points out that while new cases remain static or are diminishing in North America, Europe and Australia, countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia are emerging as the new hotspots.“India and Brazil are the only two of the nine worst-hit countries in the world that have decided to ease their lockdowns and scale down their stringent measures – even as new cases continue to mount. India ranks fourth globally in terms of active cases,” it claimed.It, however, said that India’s national commitments on climate are far more ambitious than most countries – including the US and nations in Europe.“The book makes it quite clear that we will need new futures, new directions for growth. But this can’t happen if our natural resources are threatened and our governance systems and practices are failing. ‘Green’ growth requires protection and sustainable use of our natural resources. ‘Green’ growth cannot happen if our health is compromised,” Narain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-pandemic-has-put-265-million-people-at-risk-of-starvation-study/story-bxqUBAPyOSsFAz1ML8dHEM.html

The resignations prompted the Congress to divide its remaining legislators into seven groups and rush them to different places in the state to prevent further desertions until the polling is held, party functionaries aware of the matter said. The Gujarat seats are going to the polls along with 20 others across the country.A party needs 35 first preference votes to win a seat as the strength of the Gujarat assembly is now 173. Five Congress legislators earlier resigned from the assembly in March. Two more seats remain vacant in the state assembly because of litigation due to poll-related disputes. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with 103 seats needs two more votes to win three of the four Rajya Sabha seats. The Congress is banking on Bharatiya Tribal Party’s two, the lone legislator of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and independent lawmaker Jignesh Mevani to win two seats. The BJP has fielded Abhay Bhardwaj, Ramilaben Bara, and Narhari Amin. Shaktisinh Gohil and Bharatsinh Solanki are the Congress’s candidates.Gujarat assembly speaker Rajendra Trivedi said Congress legislators Akshay Patel and Jitu Chaudhary met him on Wednesday evening to handover their resignations. “I have accepted their resignations. They now cease to be the legislators,” he said on Thursday.Congress leader Ahmed Patel accused the BJP of horse-trading amid the Covid-19 crisis. “Isn’t Gujarat government the only one in the world where: 1) Government has abandoned people in the middle of a global pandemic? 2) Refused to fund train fare for poor migrants? 3) But leaves no stone unturned to fund horse-trading activities for a Rajya Sabha election?” he tweeted.Paresh Dhanani, the opposition leader in the Gujarat assembly, also accused the BJP of breaking the Congress to win the Rajya Sabha polls. “The BJP has opened its shop to buy Congress legislators from the money amassed through corrupt means. The BJP is using the state machinery and money power to win elections,” he said.The BJP rejected the allegations, saying Congress legislators were leaving the party as they were “unhappy” with its leadership. “I believe that some more Congress legislators would also resign in the near future. They are leaving Congress because they are unhappy with the party leadership,” Amin said.Congress legislators Alpesh Thakor and Dhavalsinh Zala cross-voted in favour of the BJP when it fielded external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Jugal Thakor for Rajya Sabha in July last year. The two seats were left vacant after Union ministers Amit Shah and Smriti Irani were elected to Parliament’s lower House, or Lok Sabha.Ahmed Patel managed to get re-elected to the Rajya Sabha for the fifth time in August 2017 after a keenly contested election. The Rajya Sabha elections were earlier scheduled to be held on March 26, but were deferred due to the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent imposition of the nationwide lockdown to check its spread from March 25.The NCP has separately removed its Gujarat chief Shankersinh Vaghela and appointed Jayant Patel in his place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/setback-for-congress-ahead-of-rs-polls-as-two-gujarat-mlas-resign/story-WwUt8eSPBQvuBT9y7CdqKN.html
04-06-2020||India||Allow us to reopen hotels, Goa’s tourism industry pleads with govt||Goa’s tourism industry has sought a quick reopening of the hotel industry lest the prolonged lockdown causes businesses to shut down entirely making revival more difficult. The tourism industry which contributes more than 9% to Goa’s GDP, has been hardest hit by the lockdown. It has claimed that if the government can’t give the industry any relief, it should at least allow it to resume business. “Many people including those at the managerial level have lost their jobs. Those who still have their jobs are sent on unpaid leave. If the delay lasts longer it will be difficult to restart even if the government gives the go ahead,” Nilesh Shah the president of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa told HT. “The government should make its stance clear regarding the reopening of the sector. Right now many of us are receiving inquiries for later in the year but we cannot give customers any assurance that hotels will be open and what the protocols will be so that they can plan their travel and events,” Savio Mesias a hotel owner in Goa said. Hotels have been closed in Goa since March and haven’t been accepting new bookings. While the government announced easier travel between states under Unlock 1, there is no clarity on when hotels would be allowed to reopen. “If we have clarity regarding the SOPs for the restart, at least we can then get ready for our own SOPs,” Messias added. Shah said opening even 50% of the hotels would be a start the industry needs to revive itself.“We were promised that the industry would be allowed to open from the second week of June onwards. But even if it is allowed to open by July, then it should be done. Even if only 50% of the hotels open, at least it will be a start,” Shah said.The tourism industry expects that the effects of coronavirus on travel will continue for up to a year. But it is hoping that travel for work and business will pick up in the coming months. For Goa’s tourism sector, it is of little comfort that the lockdown has come during the off-season at a time when tourist traffic is low on account of the monsoon and European tourists returning home where the summer and spring are pleasant.The Travel and Tourism Association of India has estimated that the Covid-19 pandemic will cost the state tourism industry far more than the Rs1,000-crore loss they had originally estimated and job losses to about 60,000-75,000 people unless remedial measures are taken.Hotels have laid off staff en masse leaving people without a regular source of income since the lockdown began and stopped all travel.Around 55 lakh foreign and domestic tourists visited the state in 2019 and contributed between 9-11% to the state’s GDP.The industry has pitched for reduction in fees, taxes as well as a moratorium on repayments none of which have yet been accepted by the government. The Goa government has yet to make its stance clear with Chief Minister Pramod Sawant saying that a decision is yet to be taken but could be taken by early next week in tune with the Centre’s guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allow-us-to-reopen-hotels-goa-s-tourism-industry-pleads-with-govt/story-WHzLMxbCJnVSxR6TokXdGK.html

He sought a direction to the government and BMC to immediately stop the practice of keeping bodies of Covid-19 infected victims in wards where people are being treated for the infection. Shelar’s advocates further argued, “Retention of the bodies in active wards in Sion Hospital as recently reported is a matter of serious concern. It gives rise to medical as well as humanitarian issues. No civilized society can afford to repeatedly witness such incidents.”In light of these submissions, Shelar sought directions to the authorities to initiate a probe into the incident and register cases against the hospital staff responsible for letting the bodies of the deceased remain in active wards and to follow procedure laid down by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Central government for disposal of bodies of Covid-19 victims.After hearing the submissions, the court directed the state government and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to respond with details about how bodies of Covid-19 victims were handled and disposed and posted the matter for hearing next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-asks-govt-bmc-to-explain-process-for-disposal-of-bodies-of-covid-19-victims/story-aIjXQ8REaDFZRKhU5C5yaK.html

The detentions were the result of an operation jointly mounted by Delhi Police and Military Intelligence.Pakistan condemned India’s decision to declare the two officials persona non grata and expel them, saying they were detained on “false and unsubstantiated charges”. A statement from Pakistan’s Foreign Office contended the two men were tortured and threatened to “accept false charges” despite identifying themselves as diplomatic staff.India rejected these contentions, and people familiar with developments said the Pakistan officials were caught red handed while indulging in espionage.There have been several instances of the harassment of Indian diplomats in Islamabad in recent years after bilateral ties plunged to an all-time low.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-diplomats-harassed-in-islamabad-new-delhi-complains-to-pakistan-govt/story-5wqwhoTAogK5mMDf9dBW8I.html

04-06-2020||India||Separate bench of Andhra HC to hear LG polymers gas leak case||A separate bench of the Andhra Pradesh high court will hear the case of LG Polymers India Ltd from whose plant at Visakhapatnam a leakage of styrene gas on May 7 killed 12 people.A vacation bench of the high court comprising Justice A V Sesha Sai and Justice K Lalitha on Thursday directed the registrar to refer the LG Polymers issue to chief justice J K Maheshwari to constitute a separate bench to conduct the hearings.The vacation bench, which took up the petition of LG Polymers to allow 30 of its employees into the Visakhapatnam plant to take up emergency works, posted the case to a later date which the chief justice will decide after the court vacations end on June 15.The high court had suo motu taken up the case of styrene gas leak from LG Polymers plant at R R Venkatapuram in Visakhapatnam on the day the incident took place.Meanwhile, the Andhra Pradesh government filed a counter-affidavit to the high court stating that it had not given any no-objection certificate (NOC) to LG Polymers Ltd to reopen the Visakhapatnam plant as part of relaxations granted to industries during Lockdown 3.0 after May 4.In the counter-affidavit, state special chief secretary (industries) Karikal Valavan said the LG Polymers had indeed sent a mail to the industries department seeking permission for operation of the plant and the government had asked the company to submit a declaration stating that its plant did not come under the containment zone and the buffer zone.“However, there was no such declaration from LG Polymers. So, the department has not given any NOC to the company. Moreover, polystyrene, expandable polystyrene and engineering plastics do not fall under the essential industrial goods category,” the official said in the affidavit.The official clarified that there was no contamination of drinking water in Meghadrigadda reservoir closer to the LG Polymers plant. The Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) authorities had tested the water samples and had not found any residues of styrene in the water. It was also studying the air pollution levels around the company from time to time, he said.Valavan said the APPCB had already withdrawn the consent given to the company for production and management of the Vizag plant. The company had been sealed and the passports of the directors had been seized, he explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/separate-bench-of-andhra-hc-to-hear-lg-polymers-gas-leak-case/story-4crs1w6XmL5jmRLbWyJQQO.html

India is also now its largest manufacturer, accounting for more than 60% of Gavi vaccines.The acting UK high commissioner, Jan Thompson, said: “I was pleased to see such a strong endorsement from Prime Minister Modi at today’s summit, and to hear his message about the importance of global solidarity.“As he said, India’s capacity to produce vaccines at low cost and research expertise will play a very important role. The UK is Gavi’s leading donor and already playing a major role in the international response to Coronavirus. I’m delighted to see the continuing and excellent UK-India collaboration as a force for good against Covid-19 – from vaccine development to keeping essential medical supply routes open.”UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he hoped the summit will be the “moment when the world comes together to unite humanity in the fight against disease”.Gavi’s efforts, including during the Covid-19 pandemic, help stop the spread of infectious diseases and resurgence of other epidemics. “If a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine is developed, it will also have a role in its delivery around the world. Global access will ensure a collective international recovery,” said a statement from the UK high commission.Gavi has immunised more than 760 million children in the poorest countries, saving more than 13 million lives. It holds a pledging conference every five years to raise funds for its next strategic period, and Thursday’s summit secured funding for 2021-25.The UK has supported Gavi since its inception in 2000 and is its largest donor, with a pledge of £1.65 billion for the next five years. The Global Vaccine Summit 2020 built on the UK’s recent role as co-lead for the Global Coronavirus Response Initiative on May 4, which raised 7.4 billion euros (about £6.64 billion) for vaccines, tests and treatment to tackle the Coronavirus.UK-India collaboration for a possible coronavirus vaccine includes a consortium comprising Serum Institute, Gates Foundation, MIT and Spy Biotech, a UK-based biotech company, which is trying to develop a vaccine using the new “spy-tag vaccine development technology”. Oxford Nanopore is also working with some of India’s leading scientific institutions to focus on rapid analysis of Coronavirus samples, while a long-term Merck and Wellcome Trust venture on vaccine research, policy and manufacturing will be based in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-joins-uk-s-global-vaccine-mission-commits-15-million-over-next-five-years/story-5cIucvV0EQVEqEgmTJ7RAO.html

The report said that the loss due to lockdown was about 9.5% of the present GSDP.The report also estimates that between 15.7 lakh and 27.1 lakh people could become unemployed in Assam. The rate of unemployment could increase from the present 8% to up to 27% because of the lockdown as well as estimated return of six lakh to 10 lakh workers from other states in the country.Due to return migration of workers back to the state, Assam is expected to lose around Rs 3,600 crore annually in the form of remittances, the report said.Due to unemployment, the poverty ratio in the state could jump from 32% (2011-2012 figure) to as high nearly 51% if there’s a 15% fall in income.

The elephant, which died in Kerala’s Malappuram.He also tagged BJP leader and former Union minister Maneka Gandhi. He said the killing of the elephant left him shocked and depressed.“Kerala is supposed to have high literacy. Is it the way literate people behave? Don’t they have heart? I am shocked and depressed,” Srinivasan told Hindustan Times.Hailing from a family of agriculturists at Vuyyuru in Krishna district, Srinivasan moved to Hyderabad after graduation in 1985 and was involved in stock broking activities. He said some of his friends also came forward to supplement his efforts after seeing his twee. “Let me see whether the reward could be scaled up. But I would like to offer Rs 2 lakh from my own pocket,” he said.Once the informer about the elephant killer is traced, Srinivasan wants to go all the way to Kerala to hand over the cash reward to the person. “My intention is to convey the message that assault on wildlife is as heinous as attack on humans. All are equal in nature,” he said.He said it was unfortunate that the laws were not very stringent towards people involved in cruelty towards animals. “At the most, the accused might get imprisonment for three years. I feel he should get life imprisonment for such inhuman activity and the culprits should be named and shamed. But the laws have to be amended for the same,” Srinivasan said.Earlier in the day, Kerala Chief Minister Pinyarayi Vijayan tweeted that the culprits would be brought to book.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-man-promises-rs-2-lakh-for-informer-about-kerala-elephant-killers/story-S4tNdhE6GkPC5G9o09wOfO.html

But then the Mumbaikar saw his family helping the needy in lockdown, and changed his mind. “I received cash as a gift this year, and initially I thought I will buy a Lego set for myself; but then I realised how my family has been helping the distressed in these times and I decided to do the same. I donated to The Shakkar Para project — for feeding the hungry during the pandemic, and running the relief project in areas affected by cyclone Amphan — and felt so happy.” Poonam, Kabir’s mother, feels proud of her young one’s decision. “We have to inculcate these habits, of donating, in kids at a very young age... this birthday of Kabir will always be special,” adds Poonam. But her little one is not the only one who is celebrating his birthday while serving a cause. Many, who have had their birthdays since the lockdown began, have taken to donating for some or the other cause; and collect blessing as they bring a smile on someone’s face. Read More: Sehwag sends home-cooked food for migrant workers, draws praiseDelhi-based Devesh Gadodia, who has donated some basics to the migrant labourers on his birthday, says, “I used to celebrate all my birthdays with friends and family. We usually went out and ate together. This year is different! I did celebrate, but with a different perspective. I donated to the Hemkunt Foundation that is helping the migrants by giving them sleepers, food and other basic essentials. They even go live on Facebook while conducting some donation drives, to ensure transparency; so I thought of celebrating my birthday by helping them in their endeavour.”“Donating money is one thing, and going out and helping migrants who are walking back home is another.... it made me realise how lucky I am,” says Pratham Sharma, a Gurugrammer, who turned 21 on May 17. He adds, “Rather than making virtual plans with family and friends, I went to the NGO where one of my friends is working and joined in the donation drive on the road. There were migrants waking in this scorching heat, and here I was driving my AC car. That experience has changed the way I look at life; I’m only grateful that I got an opportunity do donate, and the fact that it was my birthday makes it all the more special.”Some are even raising funds virtually, by running campaigns on their Facebook accounts. Mumbai-based Mukta Deshpande recently ran one such online campaign, for the cause of spreading literacy, on her birthday. All her friends, who wished her on social media, were directed to this cause, and many helped in complete the target for donation. “I had no idea that this can be done on Facebook. I thought of helping an NGO and started an online campaign to raise some money, to make my birthday special not for only me but others as well.” Author tweets @ruchikagarg271For more stories follow @HTcity and @htlifeandstyle||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/birthday-wish-during-covid-19-donate-to-bring-back-smiles/story-fUy9QknKh7JafsDmYHyHZI.html
04-06-2020||India||Race for Rajya Sabha tickets heat up in Karnataka in both BJP, Congress camps||With four members of the Rajya Sabha retiring on June 25, the race to replace them has become hectic in Karnataka with lobbying in both national parties – the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Indian National Congress intensifying. Two Congress members – B K Hariprasad and Prof M V Rajeev Gowda are retiring, while BJP’s Prabhakar Kore and Janata Dal (Secular)’s D Kupendra Reddy’s term also ends.Given the current composition in the 224 member Karnataka assembly, where BJP has 117 MLA’s while Congress has 68 and JD(S) has 34, with three independents and two seats being vacant, the BJP can elect two Rajya Sabha MP’s while Congress can send one – but with extra votes to spare and JD(S) - if it manages additional votes, can elect one person.For a member to be elected to the RS from Karnataka, they would require 44 votes. So, the BJP can comfortably elect two members, with votes to spare. While Prabhakar Kore an education baron, is keen for another term the BJP is unlikely to oblige given that he has already has served two consecutive terms. Tejaswini the wife of former union minister Anant Kumar who narrowly missed out the Bangalore South Lok Sabha seat won by her husband for six consecutive terms is considered to be a key contender.Ramesh Katti, the brother of BJP’s eight-term MLA Umesh Katti has publicly declared that Chief Minister Yediyurappa should keep his promise of sending him to the upper house of parliament. “I have urged the CM to fulfill his promise of (sending me to the RS) he made last year when I was denied the Chikkodi Lok Sabha ticket,” Ramesh Katti told HT. Umesh Katti is said to be unhappy at not being inducted into the cabinet and a recent meeting he held with some of the other unhappy rebels in the party created ripples. So the party may seriously consider his brother’s candidature to mollify the Kattis.Another lesser known name doing the rounds is of Prof M Nagaraj said to be a Sangh ideologue from the northern Karnataka stronghold of BJP. North Karnataka legislators of the party have complained that while the party won bulk of the seats from this part of the state, representation in power has not reflected this. The BJP state-in-charge Muralidhara Rao himself is seen as a contender for one of the Rajya Sabha seats. Industrialist and media baron Vijay Sankeshwar a former three-term Lok Sabha member is also seen to be in the running.However, two surprising names which are doing the rounds from the BJP quota include Sudha Murthy – noted philanthrophist and the wife of Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy and that of K V Kamath the former ICICI bank honcho. A senior BJP leader who did not want to be identified told HT, “Ultimately it will be a call of the party high command in consultation with the Chief Minister, so from all the names doing the rounds while they might have aspirations, only the core committee will ultimately decide.”In the lone seat that Congress can win, former leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Mallikarjuna Kharge is seen as the front runner. The other names being mentioned include former union ministers – K H Muniyappa and Veerpa Moily. Even B K Hari Prasad is keen on returning to the upper house but given his frosty relations with former CM Siddaramiah who wields considerable influence in the state unit; this may not come to pass. Muniyappa a seven term Member of Parliament speaking to HT said, “I am not an aspirant and would gladly support any choice made by the high command. I am ready to work in the organization to bring the party back to power in the state. My only desire is that those who have stabbed the party in the back and helped BJP come to power should not get rewarded,” indicating the divisions in the party.The Congress will have nearly 24 votes to spare and is likely to support JD(S) supremo and former PM Deve Gowda if he decides to contest. JD(S) needs 10 more votes to elect a member and in turn Congress is likely to seek the support of the regional party to elect one more MLC – the elections for which are also round the corner.Political analyst Prof Harish Ramaswamy said that Yediyurappa will have to do a tight rope walk to ensure that he keeps all sections in the party happy while choosing the RS candidates. “Congress and JD(S) are likely to reach an understanding as it will also enhance further ties between the two parties to jointly take on the BJP in the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/race-for-rajya-sabha-tickets-heat-up-in-karnataka-in-both-bjp-congress-camps/story-LB8vzZOVTfAbrKk1tdZ5UP.html

After an initial setback due the lockdown, I managed to come out of the shell and release my music video in a new avatar,” says the Lucknowite over the phone.Talking about how all her travelling plans and work got disturbed due to the ongoing lockdown, she said, “I was scheduled to travel abroad on March 24 and just before that all the flights were cancelled. I was supposed to fly to Denmark, different parts of Europe, Canada and the US for a shoot with my team. Lockdown came as a set-back for us as we had paid for tickets, locations, hotels and all. It was a big loss of money and one year’s hard work for the prep of ‘Upgrade’ album was all gone in one go.” That left her upset for a week. “I switched off my phone and cried my heart out. Then, I had a chat with my music director and producer Arian Romal, based in Europe. We already had music and songs ready with us. And we had to just shoot the music videos and release. He came up with an idea that why we don’t shoot it in animated 3-D version and as I had shot a film like that as well, I was more than happy with the idea. Then a 3-D character was created and finally the video happened.”The song ‘Bon Appetite’ has crossed 1 million views. “I am happy that people are liking it even though it’s a English number. I got a very positive feedback from my hometown as well. I’m glad to have reached to all the listeners far and wide. I deliberately chose English genre, penned it myself with a risk it can fail but we must try new things.” She will be releasing her next this month end and her album will have eight songs.The ‘1920: Evil Return’ actor is now looking forward to shoot the remaining songs soon. Last, she shot for ‘Lakeerin’ in Lucknow earlier this year. She is also in talks with a team for an international film. “For now, my first preference will be my music videos and the international film. Besides, Hindi films, music and shows will keep happening like before when everything restarts,” she said.As the flights resumed, she wanted to visit Lucknow. “My parents said that I must not travel at the moment. I am relieved that Lucknow is safer. Here I am staying with my brother and we have an in-house help. Luckily, I have a studio at home so I was able to make music. Rest, besides this album, my riyaz (practice) and fitness regime keeps me busy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/a-creative-quarantine-for-tia/story-kt54LoVn9ANWmX4UdWuitO.html
04-06-2020||India||Amid lockdown, job seeker registrations hit a high of 87,421 for May in Rajasthan||Rajasthan saw 87,421 job registrations made last month, more than 20 times the registrations seen in May last year, according to official data from the union ministry of labour and employment, which also points to a rise in joblessness in the last two months when the enforcement of lockdown led to massive losses in employment and livehlihoods, mostly amongst the migrant workers.The online portal of the union ministry of labour and employment shows a dramatic rise in the number of job seekers in Rajasthan between April and May. In April, the figure was 31,055, which rose to 87,421 in May. The May figure is even bigger than the previous high of 72,571 registered in January 2019, when the Congress government in the state promised an unemployment dole after coming to power in December 2018.Compared year on year, the registrations have shown a 20 time jump. In May 2019, there were 4,033 job registrations, while in April 2019, the number was 4,709.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Close to half of the 87,421 registrations made in the month of May are made up of women applicants-- 39,050 or 44.6 % remaining 48,371 applicants are males. A majority of applicants are class 10 pass-outs.The growing demand for jobs is also highlighted in the huge jump seen in people availing the rural jobs guarantee scheme--MGNREGS. It is currently employing around 44 lakh labourers, the highest in the country.In addition, the state labour department has captured data of about 45 lakh eligible labourers who have registered with the department’s new online employment exchange.The job registrations in Rajasthan preceding the lockdown were much lower. 10,798 people had registered in January 2020, followed by 15,087 registrations in February and 12,160 in March.Nesar Ahmed, director of the Budget Analysis and Research Centre Trust, said all data of the lockdown period points to high unemployment. “There was high unemployment earlier, too, but with the lockdown, everything was shut and people lost jobs and migration only worsened the situation.”According to the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy, unemployment in Rajasthan was 17.7 per cent in April 2020 and 14.1 per cent in May 2020.Ahmed said the unemployment rate had shown a decline in May due to the cushioning provided by MGNREGS which is likely to exhaust in 100 days, therefore the government should plan for the long term.“They should develop non-farm employment such as manufacturing. In agriculture too, they should emphasis on value addition such developing the food processing industry, dairy and animal husbandry,” Ahmed said.Development professional Jaipal Singh Kaushik said the employment problem could continue for the next 12 to 18 months.“While the absolute numbers are just a fraction of the real extent of unemployment, it is an indicator of the dismal situation on the ground after the outbreak of the Covid pandemic and the lockdown.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-lockdown-job-seeker-registrations-hit-a-high-of87-421-for-may-in-rajasthan/story-opWMpgIyggaG94fS50iCvN.html

Classes 10, 11, and 12 will resume from July 1, classes 6, 7, 8, and 9 on June 15 and the primary section in August, state education minister Kanwar Pal Gujjar said.Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal, and Uttarakhand governments are considering reopening schools from July 1.Bihar and Jharkhand governments have indicated that the summer vacations could be extended by another month, as a growing number of Covid-19 positive cases are being reported on a daily basis following the return of stranded migrant workers from across the country because of the easing of lockdown restrictions.On May 25, the National Council for Education, Research and Training (NCERT) had recommended to the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) that the secondary and higher secondary classes should be allowed from mid-July, if the lockdown is fully lifted. Several parents have started an online petition on change.org, urging the Central and the state governments not to reopen schools until a vaccine for Covid-19 is developed or a state is free of the viral outbreak.“Children are highly susceptible to contracting SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19. How can schools ensure strict social distancing norms and other preventive measures?” asked Kanika Khybri, a Delhi-based parent of a five-year-old child.On May 30, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had said that the schools and other educational institutions could reopen in consultation with the state governments from July, but did not specify any date.Though some states such as Karnataka and Uttarakhand are looking at reopening the schools from July 1, several parent bodies have opposed the move.On Thursday, Siddaramaiah, Leader of Opposition in Karnataka, urged the BS Yediyurappa-led government not to reopen schools for another two months, echoing a similar plea made by several parent organisations in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schools-in-odisha-to-remain-shut-till-july-end-as-parents-raise-safety-concerns/story-ByHPVsnZI2nFx6Xr7VbwQK.html

There’s fear of damage to the ecology as oil condensate from the well has covered trees, water bodies and houses in the area located close to the Dibru Saikhowa National Park and the eco-sensitive Maguri wetland.“OIL has approached the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research--National Environment Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-NEERI), Nagpur and Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun for conducting detailed impact assessment studies,” read a statement issued by OIL on Thursday.“OIL has engaged a National Accreditation Board for Education and Training (NABET) accredited consultant to carry out environmental impact assessment study to examine the impact on the environment. The consultant team reached the site and work has started,” it added.Two experts from a Singapore-based firm Alert Disaster Control, who are to provide help in plugging the blowout, are expected to reach the site soon, the OIL statement said.Meanwhile, natural gas and condensate continued to flow “uncontrollably” and OIL personnel are pumping water to the well through the casing valve to minimize chances of a fire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oil-asks-agencies-to-assess-impact-of-assam-natural-gas-blowout-experts-from-singapore-called-in/story-t43LHTmgfQ062OcCYilgCK.html

All the respondents have been asked to file affidavits by July 14.“All the PILs wanted a ban on coal mining in the forest. But our plea specifically sought a declaration of the entire rainforest as a heritage site as per provision of Section 37 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002,” said Borthakur.Spread across 937 square kilometres, Dehing Patkai Elephant Reserve falls in Tinsukia and Dibrugarh districts in Upper Assam and is located within the periphery of the Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary, which is said to be the largest lowland tropical rainforest in the country.On April 17, National Board of Wild Life (NBWL), under the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), had recommended coal mining to be allowed in a portion of Dehing Patkai Elephant Reserve if it fulfils 28 pre-conditions.NBWL allowed CIL to conduct opencast coal mining in 98.59 hectares of the reserve forest.

When I got these two roles, the first thing I knew was they were characters with layers, just like we humans are in real lives. Nothing over the top yet both had their characteristics that were so affirmative.”With successful first season, Divyenndu is upbeat about season 2 of his OTT series: “We completed Mirzapur 2 long back and all of us are excited and await the release this year. The kind of love my character of Munna received was unbelievable. I remember I was shooting for my film ‘Shukranu’ in Lucknow and some protests were on so our shooting vehicles were asked to take another route. And then this officer knocked at my window, and when I rolled down the glass he was like, ‘Arre yeh toh Munna Tripathi Bhaiya hai, jaane do iinko.’ I was thrilled with the kind of impact the character has had on people that after months of its release,” said the ‘Toilet: Ek Prem Katha’ actor over the phone.With films across genres in his body of work, the Film and Television Institute of India graduate feels that without a film background or godfather the way his career has shaped up is truly satisfying. “I try to give all to the characters I take up. I study them, research about them and then project them on screen. Like for the film ‘Kanpuriye’ where I played a small town lawyer, I tried adding nuances to this smart yet tricky young boy.”Divyenndu was about to wrap a feature film set in Madhya Pradesh when lockdown happened, “I was shooting. The film is called ‘Mere Desh ki Dharti’ and is about a contemporary young boy and his beautiful bond with distressed farmers. The film is 95% done and will go into post production soon. So I was working at a stretch before the lockdown happened and I took the phase as a break. I also connected with a group of youngsters in my neighbourhood who are tirelessly working for the migrants and I tried contributing whatever I can.”The actor feels with the number of films and series he has shot in UP he has become more of a UPite, “Yeah I keep on telling my team and friends ‘Ke sochta hu ke Lucknow mei ek ghar bana lu’ as all my work are so UP centric. Also I love being there and enjoy multiple culture that are part of the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/sochta-hu-ke-lucknow-mei-ek-ghar-bana-lu/story-hnEIeCIrRaikpHJUvVTdwO.html

04-06-2020||India||Supreme Court slams RBI on interest on loans in moratorium||A three-member Supreme Court (SC) bench on Thursday took exception about banks levying interests on loans when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had announced a moratorium on loan repayments between March and August 31 because of the lockdown restrictions following the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.The apex court made the observation while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) by an Agra resident, Gajendra Sharma, who demanded a waiver on interest charged by a private bank citing the relief earlier announced by RBI on the payment of equated monthly instalments (EMIs) between March and August 31 due to the pandemic.Petitioner Sharma specifically cited RBI’s March 27 and May 22 notifications announcing a moratorium on loan repayments while permitting banks to levy interest.The three-member bench, comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan, SK Kaul, and MR Shah, said, “On one hand you are granting moratorium (on loans) but continuing with interest. It is more detrimental.”The court’s observation came a day after RBI submitted its response while opposing Sharma’s plea.The central bank told the apex court: “RBI does not consider it prudent or appropriate to go for a forced waiver of interest, risking the financial viability of the banks it is mandated to regulate, and putting the interests of the depositors in jeopardy.”But the court told Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Union Ministry of Finance, that: “You have to deal with two aspects –interest accruing during the period of moratorium and interest upon the interest that accumulates.”The court asked the Centre and RBI to jointly work out a response by June 12, the next date of the hearing of the case.Earlier, the court frowned upon RBI for leaking its affidavit in the media a day before the hearing.Senior advocate Rajiv Dutta, who appeared on behalf of petitioner Sharma, drew the court’s attention and alleged that RBI leaked the affidavit to the media as it had sought to sensationalise the case and also took a dig at the central bank for backing private banks over the citizens’ financial woes triggered by the pandemic.RBI stated in its affidavit that it shares the twin mandate to secure the interest of depositors and maintain financial stability as well. “Interest on advances (loans) forms an important and vital source of income for banks, which allows the banks to sustain and remain financially sound and profitable,” it added.Petitioner Sharma, who runs an optical shop in Agra and had taken a home loan of Rs 37 lakh from a private bank, has stated in his plea that as a borrower he is not in a position to pay his EMIs because his earnings have become nil due to the lockdown restrictions. “The imposition of interest (by banks) during the moratorium period is devastating and wrong,” he argued in his plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-slams-rbi-on-interest-on-loans-in-moratorium/story-XBvilWJgS8k02FioaJZMxN.html

The issue is confidential and we cannot go into any detail,” a spokesperson for the British high commission said.Mallya is accused of defrauding a consortium of Indian banks by close to Rs 9,000 crore and faces charges of money laundering and criminal conspiracy among others.Mallya had availed loans from 17 Indian banks for the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines and is accused of diverting it to pay for other businesses including the formula 1 team he had bought. Indian courts have declared him a fugitive and authorities have attached his various properties in an effort to recover the money owed to the banks. Mallya had fled India on March 2, 2016. Mallya has been publicly offering to return the money he owes the banks and has continuously questioned the government’s intent for allegedly refusing his offer. The last of such tweets was posted by him on May 14, in which he repeated his offer and said, “Congratulations to the Government for a Covid 19 relief package. They can print as much currency as they want BUT should a small contributor like me who offers 100% payback of State owned Bank loans be constantly ignored? Please take my money unconditionally and close.”A UK district judge Emma Arbuthnot had last year ruled that there was a prima facie case of fraud by false representation against Mallya, which was confirmed by the UK High Court. Mallya was also denied permission to challenge the high court’s judgment in the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijay-mallya-s-extradition-hits-another-wall-in-the-backdrop-of-asylum-talks/story-IXBeLCeMOjas3IiQjqe9CP.html

Some of the participants, who were later tested positive for coronavirus, had travelled to their home states across the length and breadth of the country. The decision of banning the foreign Tablighi Jamaat members was taken after details of the foreigners found illegally living in mosques and religious places emerged from across the states in India.Thousands of coronavirus cases in India tracing back to the congregations held in March at the Markaz, which is the global headquarters of Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi, has put the place in the spotlight. The sect’s leadership is already being probed for violating norms under the epidemic diseases law while its volunteers from abroad have been booked for violating visa norms and the Foreigners Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/960-blacklisted-foreign-nationals-banned-from-entering-india-for-10-years-for-involvement-in-tablighi-jamaat-incident-report/story-EsWvpuvF5Uf2yIAQ3WVxUL.html

The BMS is committed to fighting until it stops the government from taking the anti-public sector and anti-worker decisions.”The BMS has taken an adversarial position against the government’s decision. “The government is justifying the dire need of money to run its machinery. However, it has no moral right or authority to sell national assets created by its predecessors,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bms-to-organise-nationwide-protest-on-june-10-against-privatisation/story-fVbgjkUJZnIrVoUN1Ru18I.html
04-06-2020||India||As Karnataka prepares for Rajya Sabha polls, friction grows in state unit||The rumblings of dissent have grown in the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Karnataka unit over the nominations for the two of the state’s four vacant seats in the Rajya Sabha (RS), which goes to the polls on June 19.Though senior party leaders in Delhi have downplayed the friction, the opposition in Karnataka is using the opportunity to corner the BS Yediyurappa-led government. On Wednesday, opposition leader Siddaramaiah claimed on social media that disgruntled BJP leaders had met him to express their displeasure with the party.Of the four RS vacant seats in Karnataka, the BJP is expecting to win two and the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) are likely to fight it out for the other two.Last week, a late-night meeting was attended by over a dozen BJP members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) from north Karnataka. The meeting is being perceived as a mark of rebellion against the Yediyurappa government, which is also preparing for the upcoming state legislative council elections.Reports suggested that the BJP lawmakers from north Karnataka met at senior party MLA Umesh Katti’s residence. Katti himself is eyeing a place in the state cabinet, while also seeking an Upper House berth for his brother.The murmurs of dissent have not gone down well with the party brass in the national capital.“Everyone has an aspiration to either become a minister or get a ticket to contest an election. These decisions cannot be taken on the basis of arm-twisting. There is a system in place, where the parliamentary board takes its decision that needs to be followed in every state,” said a BJP functionary in Delhi, requesting anonymity.Discord is brewing over the distribution of 24 by-poll tickets in the BJP’s Madhya Pradesh (MP) unit and also over the selection of a new party president in Himachal Pradesh (HP).In MP, where the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government made a comeback after being out of power for 15 months; there is disquiet over the possibility of 22 rebel MLAs being given tickets for the by-poll to 24 assembly constituencies, whenever the Election Commission of India (ECI) announces the dates.Earlier, state unit president VD Sharma had told HT that the “sacrifices” made by the Congress MLAs, who broke away from the party that led to the ouster of the Kamal Nath government, would have to be taken into consideration.Several leaders in MP, who are aspiring for by-poll tickets, have also raised the issue with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJP’s ideological brain trust. These leaders had pointed out that overlooking its own party cadre would not incentivise party discipline, according to a BJP leader from MP, who is privy to the development.HP is the latest state to report dissent in the BJP’s ranks after Rajeev Bindal stepped down as the party president because his name figured, albeit in an oblique manner, in a corruption scandal of the health department.“There are a couple of contenders for the president’s post; and as is natural, their support groups have been holding meetings. There is, however, no threat to the Jairam Thakur-led state government. The resignation in itself was an internal course correction and this is not an issue that can be politicised (by the opposition),” said a BJP leader.“There’s no threat to any of the state governments. All decisions will be made by the high command after following the due process,” said a third leader, who declined to be named.Earlier in February, BJP leader from Maharashtra Eknath Khadse had accused the party of sidelining senior other backward class (OBC) leaders after his name did not figure in the list of candidates for the member of legislative council (MLC) elections. Former Maharashtra ministers such as Pankaja Munde and Chandrashekhar Bawankule, who were also overlooked, have refrained from making any comment in public, but have made their displeasures known for the party snub.Political analyst Shirish Kashikar said the BJP has been following the model of further weakening the opposition wherever it is on a weak wicket. “Each state unit has its own dynamics, and it is obvious that there will be friction if old party workers are made to compete for posts or tickets with their erstwhile opponents. In each of these cases, the disagreements are not so intense or deep that the opposition can instigate defection or cause the government to fall, as it had happened when the BJP engineered the fall of the Kamal Nath government in MP,” said Kashikar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-karnataka-prepares-for-rs-polls-friction-grows-in-state-unit/story-tYnDp0RgWuKwi4xQySEoeM.html
04-06-2020||India||‘Confidential’ legal issue has to be resolved for Vijay Mallya’s extradition, says UK||Britain said on Thursday a “confidential” legal issue was holding up the extradition of businessman Vijay Mallya to India but that it is seeking to deal with the matter as quickly as possible.Mallya, wanted in India to face charges of financial irregularities, lost his appeal against the 2018 order to extradite him in the UK high court in April. Last month, the high court also refused Mallya permission to appeal in the UK Supreme Court.Amid a string of reports in the Indian media that Mallya’s extradition was imminent, a spokesperson for the British high commission said there was still a legal issue of a confidential nature that needs to be resolved before the businessman could be sent back to India.“Vijay Mallya last month lost his appeal against extradition, and was refused leave to appeal further to the UK Supreme Court,” the spokesperson said.“However, there is a further legal issue that needs resolving before Mr Mallya’s extradition can be arranged. Under United Kingdom law, extradition cannot take place until it is resolved. The issue is confidential and we cannot go into any detail,” the spokesperson added.The spokesperson declined to “estimate how long this issue will take to resolve”, and said: “We are seeking to deal with this as quickly as possible.”Mallya, 64, is wanted in India to face charges of financial offences involving Rs 9,000 crore borrowed by his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines from several Indian banks.Senior district judge Emma Arbuthnot had issued the ruling for Mallya’s extradition to India in December 2018 in response to a request from the Indian government, which has accused him of “knowingly misrepresenting” the profitability of his companies when he sought bank loans in 2009.UK home secretary Priti Patel is expected to make a final decision on his extradition.The UK high court, in its ruling in April, had upheld the senior district judge’s verdict. When the UK high court refused Mallya permission to appeal to the UK Supreme Court on May 14 on the ground that his case didn’t involve a “point of law of general public importance”, the long-drawn extradition process was believed to have entered the last stage.Mallya, who was arrested in London in April 2017, had the option of approaching the European Court of Human Rights on the ground his human rights would be at risk if extradited. The UK remains subject to the jurisdiction of the European court until the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/confidential-legal-issue-has-to-be-resolved-for-vijay-mallya-s-extradition-says-uk/story-hmne56i2pQFS64y8x972fJ.html

However on Wednesday, it recommended the trial to be continued following a review of safety data.“On the basis of the available mortality data... the members of the Solidarity Data Safety Monitoring Committee unanimously agreed that there are no cogent reasons to recommend modifications of the protocol of the trail and advised that the trial should be continued as planned,” the Executive Group of the Steering Committee of the Solidarity Trial wrote to all National Principal Investigators of the Solidarity Trial.Welcoming WHO’s decision, ICMR Director General Dr Balram Bhargava said, “ICMR and India have been firm on recommendations about the drug based on biological plausibility, in vitro data and case controlled studies.“It is a time tested drug in use for decades. Any positive outcome from the clinical exercise will be in the larger interest of the people globally.” He had earlier said that no major side-effects of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine has been found in studies in India and its use can be continued as prophylaxis for Covid-19 under strict medical supervision.AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria said WHO’s decision about resuming the HCQ arm of the clinical trial was “a step in the right direction towards larger public interest”.“Data from India both from AIIMS and ICMR shows a good safety profile. We did not find that this drug was causing significant cardiac toxicity and therefore it is good that WHO reviewed their data and reintroduced the drug in the trial.“This is a drug which is less expensive, easily available and has been used widely for a long time with good safety data. It will be good if the medicine turns out be beneficial in some way in COVID-19 treatment,” he said.Dr Sheela Godbole, the National Coordinator of the WHO-India Solidarity Trial and Head of the Division of Epidemiology, ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute said the hydroxychloroquine arm of the Solidarity Trial alone was paused as the Solidarity Data Safety Monitoring Committee reviewed the data. “Yesterday, the report of this committee was received and they advised that the trial should be continued as planned. Based on this, the Executive Group has restarted the hydroxychloroquine arm. The world needs strong data from well-conducted randomised controlled clinical trials on the drug for treatment of COVID-19. We are glad that we can begin the hydroxychloroquine arm again,” Dr Godbole said.Besides hydroxychloroquine, three more treatment protocols -- remdesivir, comibnation of lopinavir and ritonavir, and lopinavir and ritonavir with Interferon beta-1a -- are being evaluated during the clinical trials at selected hospitals in the world.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in its revised advisory on May 22 recommended use of the drug as a preventive medication for COVID-19 for asymptomatic healthcare workers in non-COVID hospitals and frontline staff on surveillance duty in containment zones and paramilitary/police personnel involved in coronavirus infection related activities.The drug is also recommended for all asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in containment and treatment of Covid-19 and household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases.The Union health ministry on March 31 had also recommended use of hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin on Covid-19 patients who are in severe condition requiring ICU management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-back-who-s-move-to-resume-clinical-trial-of-hydroxychloroquine-for-covid-19-treatment/story-aDyeVLgQDqeofVISVvyi1M.html
04-06-2020||India||‘Vijay Mallya’s extradition not possible until legal issue resolved,’ says UK||Businessman Vijay Mallya, who is accused of cheating Indian banks to the tune of thousands of crores of rupees, will not be extradited anytime soon as there are legal issues involved, the UK govt said on Thursday. Mallya is currently in the United Kingdom trying to evade extradition to India.“Confidential legal issue needs to be resolved before Vijay Mallya’s extradition can be arranged,” said UK high commission spokesperson.Mallya who founded the now-defunct Kingfisher airlines, fled to Britain in March 2016 after facing accusations of financial irregularities amounting to over Rs 9,000 crore. Mallya has consistently claimed that the charges he faces are baseless and fabricated and the Centre refused to take him up on his offer to clear his loans.Mallya’ extradition to India is based on a first information report filed by the CBI in July 2015 in connection with a Rs 900 crore loan sanctioned by IDBI Bank to KFA. The Enforcement Directorate has charge sheeted Mallya in both cases, alleging that he diverted most of the money into foreign assets, the Indian Premier League (IPL) team and F1 motorsport firm Formula One. Mallya’s assets worth Rs 13,000 crore have already been attached by ED.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijay-mallya-s-extradition-not-possible-until-legal-issue-resolved-uk-govt/story-PZPXhxhaGhi73jH0CikuDL.html

Narayan Nawale was injured at the same time.Nawale and his family belong to Vahagaon village in Khed tehsil.The district collector said that as many as 140 houses were damaged due to heavy rains and gusty winds. Besides the Nawales, Prakash Mokar (52), of Mokarwadi in Haveli tehsil, died after sustaining critical injuries while holding onto the tin roof of his house.The IMD in its assessment stated that conditions are likely to become favourable for further advancement of the Southwest Monsoon into some more parts of Central Arabian Sea, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal, southwest including east central Bay of Bengal; entire Southeast Bay of Bengal and some parts of West central Bay of Bengal during the next 2-3 days.IMD Director Anupam Kashyapi said, “The impact of the cyclone has weakened but remnants of it are still there. Some rainfall and other associated climatic happenings will take place as the cyclone is still receding.”District Collector Naval Kishore Ram said that the process of providing relief to the affected people had started and the total damage to crops, hamlets and residents is being assessed by a team of district collectorate officials.Heavy rains threw life out of gear on Thursday after Cyclone Nisarga passed through a distance of just 50 km from the Pune District leading to various consequences. Six flights were diverted and one was cancelled at Pune’s Lohegaon Airport following the severe weather conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-nisarga-death-toll-in-pune-climbs-to-3-as-govt-measures-damage/story-crgxOsZdaXXjUDVvaQipxH.html
04-06-2020||India||Cyclone Nisarga weakens, likely to enter Madhya Pradesh, says IMD||Cyclone Nisarga, which weakened into a low pressure area, is likely to enter Madhya Pradesh by Thursday evening from the southern parts of the state, instead of the western parts as predicted earlier, an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.The severe cyclonic storm had hit the Maharashtra coast near Alibaug in Raigad district on Wednesday afternoon.IMD officials said that the cyclone has weakened into a cyclonic storm before entering Madhya Pradesh from neighbouring Maharashtra, and is likely to lose its intensity further.As a result of the cyclone, parts of Madhya Pradesh received rainfall from Wednesday and the showers are likely to continue on Thursday as well, they said.Talking to PTI, IMD’s senior scientist Vedprakash Singh Chandel said, “Our earlier forecast was that Nisarga could enter Madhya Pradesh from Maharashtra between 7 am and 11 am on Thursday from Khandwa, Khargone and Burhanpur. But now this cyclone has lost its intensity and weakened into a low pressure area.” “In the changing weather conditions, there is a possibility that Nisarga may enter Madhya Pradesh from its southern parts like Betul, Chhindwara and Seoni around 7 pm on Thursday,” he said.According to the forecast, the cyclone is likely to have an impact in the areas under Narmadapuram, Bhopal, Sagar, Rewa, Jabalpur and Shahdol divisions in the coming hours.The meteorologist said that in the 24 hours that ended 8.30 am on Thursday, the places that recorded maximum rainfall include Segaon (136 mm), Khandwa (132 mm), Sendhwa (104 mm), Niwali (102 mm), Sonkatch (100 mm), Bhainsdehi (95.4 mm) and Amarpur (94 mm).The state government has put the administration on alert and told the authorities to be prepared to deal with the situation.In some districts, including Indore, citizens were urged to remain indoors.Several parts of MP have been getting showers since Wednesday night, which has brought relief from the sweltering heat. Barring parts of Gwalior and Chambal divisions, rainfall occurred in almost entire MP as an effect of cyclone Nisarga, said G D Mishra, senior meteorologist with IMDs Bhopal office.“Rains lashed 46 districts out of the total 52 districts in MP,” he said.According to the forecast for western parts of the state, heavy to very heavy rainfall and thunderstorm accompanied by lightning is most likely to occur at isolated places in next 24 hours.Similarly, heavy to very heavy rainfall, thunderstorm accompanied by lightning and gusty winds with speed reaching 30 to 40 kmph is very likely to occur at isolated places in eastern MP, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-nisarga-weakens-likely-to-enter-madhya-pradesh-says-imd/story-qrYPg3SVLO9wiRuItAp01H.html

A large number of shark teeth belonging to various sharks - namely Squatiscyllium nigeriensis, Ginglymostoma sokotoense, among others - were recovered from this site,” research leader Dr Priyadarshini Rajkumari said.Also read: Over 1 lakh patients beat the deadly contagion: Covid-19 state tallyAfter comparing the recovered fossils with other fossil found from Fatehgarh formation, Kapurdi formation and Akli formation in western Rajasthan, the experts found that the palaeoenvironment and palaeoecology of this new fossil site were different from the other fossil sites. Most of the fossil record from other fossil localities were deposited in coastal lagoonal environment with frequent marine and freshwater inputs. But the newly discovered fossil site lacks terrestrial and freshwater fauna as compared to the other fossil localities within Barmer district. “This could be possibly due to the different depositional environment and slightly older in age of the studied area which has been suggested as late Paplaeocene age based on the present fauna,” she added. “Most of the sharks teeth recovered from this fossil site are mainly found in nearshore shallow marine environment restricted to inner shelf area. The shark fossil from the Padma Rao quarry indicates the presence of tropical to sub-tropical climate during the deposition of fuller’s earth deposits of the Padma Rao quarry. The study of these shark teeth gave us an insight about the environmental changes from warm, humid, coastal conditions to the present-day conditions of dry and desertic climatic condition in the region,” the research paper stated.According to the research paper, one of the important findings is that the shark fossil recovered from the Padma Rao quarry also shows similarities with fossils which were found in the African region (Morocco, Nigeria and Niger), Western Europe (Belgium, England and France), North America and Asia, indicating that the fauna may have utilized the Tethys seaway as a migration route between these regions during the late Palaeocene.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/large-number-of-shark-teeth-found-at-rajasthan-s-fossil-site/story-a1NRSBK54P3CLsE9dRZwcP.html

04-06-2020||India||Bengal rolls out red carpet for central team for cyclone damage assessment||More than a month after locking horns with the Centre over the visit of inter-ministerial central teams (IMCTs) to inspect its Covid-19 management, the Bengal government in a role reversal has now has called another such team on a three-day visit to assess the losses due to cyclone Amphan as “state guests” and “VIPs”.“It may kindly be noted that the dignitary is a State Guest as per Govt’s Entertainment of State Guest Rules. It is therefore requested that due courtesies and facilities may kindly be extended to the VIP and party during their visit to the state,” reads a notification issued by the deputy secretary, department of disaster management and civil defence issued Wednesday night.The seven-member IMCT’s visit is for an “on the spot assessment of the damage and admissibility of such supplemental central assistance in the wake of cyclonic storm Amphan,” the notification says.The IMCT, led by Anuj Sharma, Joint Secretary (Cyber & Information Security), ministry of home affairs, is scheduled to hold a meeting with chief secretary Rajiva Sinha on Thursday evening after their arrival, make aerial survey of the districts of North and South 24-Parganas, and return on Saturday following a few more discussions with state officials. Other members of the team are from the ministries of agriculture, water resources, power, transport and the departments of fisheries and expenditure. The Centre has released an immediate assistance of Rs 1,000 crore to the state following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s aerial survey along with chief minister Mamata Banerjee two days after the May 20 cyclone that some have called as the worst natural calamity to hit Bengal in 300 years.Chief Minister Banerjee had earlier said that her initial estimate puts the losses at Rs 1 lakh crore.The change in the state government’s attitude towards this IMCT in contrast to the two IMCTs that visited to inspect and assess alleged Covid-19 mismanagement on the state’s part has triggered political controversies.During the April visit of the IMCTs, Bengal had virtually locked horns with the Centre, alleged disruption of the country’s federal structure and the state and the IMCTs frequently traded charges.The state unit of the BJP taunted the government for its change of heart.“The government objected to the previous IMCTs because they were afraid their data fudging would be caught and the mismanagement exposed. Now they want to extend a red carpet because the state expects money from the Centre,” said Rahul Sinha, national secretary of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the principal opponent to Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TMC).The TMC refused to take the BJP’s bait.“We don’t want to comment on it because we don’t want to politicise an administrative meeting on disaster management. Last time, we objected because the teams arrived before informing us. This time, they informed us in advance,” said a Trinamool Congress spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-rolls-out-red-carpet-for-central-team-for-cyclone-damage-assessment/story-4RQr0ZhGaGXtml7bzhGGbO.html

Remove mask, show face to CCTV camera in this Uttarakhand townThe entry in Guinness Book of World Records website says, “The tallest coriander plant is 2.16 m (7 ft 1 in) and was grown by Gopal Upreti (India) in Ranikhet, Uttarakhand, India, as measured on 21 April 2020. As an organic farmer, Gopal grows coriander every year. Using traditional Himalayan farming methods brings its own challenges. As the coriander is grown without using a polyhouse or any artificial covering, the crop is sometimes exposed to the harsh Himalayan weather conditions”.“A few days back I got confirmation on their website that my application has been accepted and my name has been recorded as the man who grew the tallest coriander plant in the world,” he said.“I had to compete against 5.9 feet (1.8) metre tall coriander plant which was the tallest coriander recorded till now in the Guinness Book of World Records. The chief horticulture officer, Almora, also came to record the height of this plant which he measured as 7 feet one inch ( 2.16 metre )”, he said.Coriander plant (dhania) scientifically called as Coriandrum Sativum is an annual herb. Most parts of this plant are edible with its fresh leaves and dried seeds used in cuisines across the globe.Upreti said he delved into organic farming in 2011 when he left Delhi where he used to work in the construction business. “I came back and started focussing on organic farming over four acres of land. As of now, I have over 2,000 apple trees in my orchard. On the sidelines, I also grow garlic and coriander”, he said.Upreti said that most of the coriander plants that he grew organically reached a height of around five feet. “And one of these plants reached a height of seven feet one inch. Then I realised that it could be a world record and as such, I should apply for the Guinness Book of World Records”, he said.“This achievement shows that organic farming has tremendous potential not only in Uttarakhand but in the whole country. It will encourage other farmers to go for organic farming in a big way”, he said.KN Pandey, chief horticulture officer, Almora, said he never came across such a tall coriander plant in his life. “I went there to record its height myself and found it to be around 7.1 feet tall. Generally, coriander plants grow up to a height of four feet to four and a half feet. It is likely that it grew so tall because he used cow dung based organic manure and ample water, which led to its good growth”, he said.

It turned out that the call was a hoax and made by the woman’s husband with whom she had a fight before leaving the house, the officers said, requesting anonymity. According to the police, the caller had reported that the woman was travelling to Bhubaneswar.“On this, the call centre officials informed the Delhi airport’s operation control centre, which in turn alerted the Delhi police and Central Industrial Security Force that secures the airport. The woman, as described by the man on the call, was traced in the boarding area of Terminal 3 where she was waiting to board her flight. She was approached and was asked to step aside and allow a detailed and thorough checking of her handbag,” said a senior CISF officer, who wished not to be named.The officer said the bomb detection and disposal squad was called in. “Because the woman’s handbag had already undergone the airport’s regular security checks, chances of her carrying any explosives were less. However, as a precautionary measure other passengers waiting in the area were also asked to move away,” the officer said. Around 6.45 pm, the threat was declared a hoax, the officer added.Deputy commissioner of police (Delhi airport) Rajeev Ranjan said a preliminary enquiry revealed that the call was made from Gurugram. “The man who was identified turned out to be the woman’s husband. She told us that the couple had a fight after which she had left the house. Because the call was made from Gurugram, DIAL{Delhi International Airport Limited} has approached Gurugram police for further legal action against the man,” Ranjan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wife-leaves-for-airport-after-fight-husband-makes-hoax-bomb-call-to-stop-her/story-r0wv1XPLGkEtuJqdpa3SLP.html

In 2016, the imports from China were worth $3.4 million.Watch| ‘Perfect time to extend ties’: PM Modi & Australian PM hold virtual summitThe two sides also signed three MoUs on cooperation in public administration and governance reforms, cooperation in vocational education and training and water resources management.The virtual summit was arranged after Morrison was forced to put off a planned visit to India twice – first in January because of the devastating bushfires in Australia and then in May because of the Covid-19 crisis.Modi reiterated his invitation to Morrison to visit India when the situation normalises. Morrison, who has met Modi four times in the recent past, joked about how he had missed out on the “famous Modi hug”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-virtual-bilateral-meet-india-and-australia-sign-seven-agreement/story-D3h5STWDauibdDRpwzDcbO.html

The court’s observation came while hearing a plea on transportation of essential commodities to the hill station.The petition has been filed by former NCP MLA Suresh Lad.Lad informed the bench of justice A K Menon that as per the previous order of the high court, the railways had started services to transport essential commodities to the hill station. The NCP leader’s lawyer Gaurav Parkar further said that the local civic administration had not hired Bharat IV compliant vehicles which had also been directed by the court.Parkar then added that the problem of the residents did not end as the railways has refused to transport LPG cylinders along with other essential commodities to Matheran saying it is against their safety norms.Parkar further submitted that before the lockdown, the cylinders were brought to the hill station on horseback but it was not an ideal situation now given the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals Act and the fact that the horses are old, tired and in very bad health.Advocate T J Pandian for central railway and advocate D P Singh for the Union of India confirmed that LPG cylinders or any inflammable material cannot be carried on railway wagons as there is an explicit bar against carriage of gas and inflammable materials.After hearing the submissions, the court directed that the monitoring committee looking after the issue should consider the problem and come up with a solution. However, additional government pleader Manish Pabale for the state informed the court that the chairperson of the committee had retired and other members were busy with cyclone Nisarg related activities it would not be possible for it to meet before 15 days.The court accepted the same and directed the petitioners to apply before the committee when they convened. Before adjourning the matter, the court observed, “In the meanwhile, it will not be out of place to mention that the viability of using electrically powered vehicle for movement of LPG should not be overlooked. The monitoring committee shall, therefore, consider the feasibility of such means including by considering a cost analysis study in the interests of the residents which the state is bound to protect.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-court-suggests-using-electric-vehicles-to-ferry-goods-to-matheran/story-aqopUC8Yno6FOV0RDC95LK.html
04-06-2020||India||India flattened the wrong curve: Rajiv Bajaj tells Rahul Gandhi on Covid-19 battle||Rajiv Bajaj, managing director (MD) of Bajaj Auto, has said that the nationwide coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced lockdown restrictions have decimated the country’s economy instead of flatting the infection curve of the raging viral outbreak.“You (the government) have not solved that problem. But you have definitely decimated the economy. You flattened the wrong curve. It is not the infection curve, it is the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) curve. This is what we have ended up with, the worst of both the worlds,” Bajaj told former Congress president Rahul Gandhi during an interaction via video link.“The way India has been locked down is draconian. This kind of lockdown, I have not heard about from anywhere else,” he said.Also read: ‘India should have looked at Covid-19 response in East’: Rajiv Bajaj to Rahul GandhiLockdown 5:0 has come into effect from June 1 even though the nationwide restrictions, which were imposed on March 25 to contain the spread of the pandemic, have been largely eased in a bid to open up economic activities.Bajaj also urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to spell out how the country would move forward after the lockdown is fully lifted, claiming that the unlocking would be anything but smooth.“I am really distressed because it is a herculean task to open up economic activities. The first problem is to get this fear out of the minds of the people. There has to be a very clear aligned narrative from the PM because, whether right or wrong, when he says something people seem to follow,” he said.“I think the PM needs to tell everyone that this is how we are going to move forward. Everything is under control. Don’t be afraid of the viral infections, only a few people are dying, and we have to move forward now,” added Bajaj.He stressed the need for a stimulus to lift the demand and revive the Covid-19 battered economy.“I strongly believe that a large country such as India cannot save itself out of trouble. It has to sell itself out of trouble. We have to get demand going again. We have to provide something that lifts the mood of the people. We need some mood elevators. I don’t understand why there is no strong initiative, even if it is for a period of six months to one year, to strongly lift the mood of the people and provide a stimulus to demand,” Bajaj said.Also read| ‘There was no lockdown even during the World War’: Rahul Gandhi on Covid-19The industrialist wondered the reason behind India’s reluctance not to focus in Asia and only looked at the west such as Italy, France, Spain, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States of America (USA).“Unfortunately, India not only looked at the west, but it also went to the wild west. I think we have stayed more towards the impervious side. We tried to implement a hard lockdown, which was still porous. I think we have ended up with the worst of both the worlds,” he said.He also said the country has fallen “very short” of disclosing facts, logic, and the truth on the viral outbreak.“This has got amplified and instilled such an enormous fear in the minds of the people that they seem to think that the contagion is equal to cancer or another life-threatening disease. Now, the government’s new narrative is to make the people comfortable with the thought of living with the virus,” added Bajaj.The dialogue was a part of Gandhi’s series of video conversations with global and Indian thought leaders to discuss the Covid-19 crisis and its consequences on the country’s economy.He has interacted with former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan, Nobel Laureate Professor Abhijit Banerjee, Harvard Professor Ashish Jha, and Swedish epidemiologist Johan Giesecke since the viral outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-flattened-the-wrong-curve-rajiv-bajaj-tells-rahul-gandhi-on-covid-19-battle/story-3tXHlc7kk5rp81ASg3VknJ.html

He said that the MLAs have resigned voluntarily.Patel represented Karjan seat of Vadodara, while Chaudhary had won from Kaprada seat of Valsad.Earlier on Wednesday, three Congress MLAs had met Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel, triggering speculations of defection, reported news agency PTI.PTI identified these MLAs as Kirit Patel, Lalit Vasoya and Lalit Kagathara. These lawmakers, however, refuted the rumours and claimed that they went to make a representation about various issues related to coronavirus and lockdown. The Rajya Sabha election for four seats in Gujarat has been scheduled on June 19. It was supposed to be held on March 26. However, it was eventually postponed for an indefinite period in the wake of coronavirus pandemic and subsequent imposition of nation-wide lockdown.While the Congress has fielded two candidates, BJP has fielded three, making it difficult for the Congress to win the second seat.In March, five Congress legislators had tendered their resignations days after the elections were announced.This had further reduced the Congress’s chances of retaining both the seats.In the 182-member Assembly, BJP has 103 MLAs and the opposition Congress 68.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-congress-mlas-from-gujarat-resign-ahead-of-rajya-sabha-polls/story-l6evK8Ep7Dfko2R4pRA3CK.html

The jumbo reportedly killed two people and damaged several houses and crops in Rahe, Silli and Angarha blocks in the past one month. The elephant, which is struggling to walk due to acute pain in his front left leg, has taken shelter in a hillock between two villages - Hesadih and Rigrigram - under Silli block.Even as veterinary doctor has prescribed the medicine, serving the medicine to the wild elephant is a big challenge for forest officials. The local villagers have extended their services to help the elephant recover from the injury. The villagers are providing pumpkins and bottle gourds in which medicine is infused and they are placed near a water body where the jumbo comes to quench his thirst every day.“Around a week back, we noticed the elephant in nearby hillock. We found the elephant was in big pain and tears rolling out of its eyes. It was not able to walk properly. We informed the forest department and requested to rescue the elephant immediately. Otherwise, it will die in pain,” said Kalipada Mahto, a resident of Hesadih.The veterinary doctor of Bhagwan Birsa Biological Park, also known as Birsa zoo, Dr Ajay Kumar was called for treatment of the elephant. “I was told that the elephant was suffering due to acute swelling, which might have caused due to injury, on his left leg. I went there around a week back but did not find the elephant. I prescribed few medicines including broad spectrum antibiotic and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs along with proteolytic enzyme,” Kumar said.The Angarha forest ranger RK Singh said, “Serving medicines to a wild elephant is a big challenge due to possible attack by it. Then, we came up with an idea to serve it through vegetables. We infused the medicines in pumpkins and bottle gourds and placed them near a water body. The elephant comes down every day from the hillock to quench his thirst and it also eats the vegetables.”The vegetables are provided by the villagers. They also placed paddy to feed the elephant.“We served medicine by this way for past three- four days. But, the elephant did not come down on Wednesday. We are concerned but nobody dares to go to the hillock, as four more wild elephants have come to the place on Tuesday night,” Singh said, adding, “we are now finding out other options.”Jharkhand is one of the worst-affected states by man-elephant conflicts. As per the data available with the forest department, man-elephant conflicts claimed 650 lives between 2009-10 and 2018-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-animal-was-in-pain-jharkhand-villagers-look-after-elephant-that-destroyed-their-houses/story-MdFnNBOZ4RIiqWHWWGgv0I.html

Dr. BA Ambedkar Road in King’s Circle is under knee-deep water, photographs, and videos circulating on social media showed.Angry Mumbaikars posted photographs and videos on social media and accused the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities of their lack of preparedness to prevent waterlogging.BJP leader and lawyer Vivekanand Gupta tweeted, “Few minutes of rain and waterlogging already on LBS near R-City Mall and Bhandup. @ShivSena ruled BMC. What work did the BMC contractors carried out? Nalla safai kidhar hai (where is the de-silting of drains?). Same scene every year.”Earlier, the civic authorities had identified 69 waterlogging spots in the city ahead of the onset of monsoon, but their preparedness was disrupted because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, which led to lockdown restrictions from end-March.The BMC authorities had planned to complete the work at 45 waterlogging spots in Mumbai before the onset of monsoon, but it got delayed because of the unavailability of an adequate workforce due to lockdown restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-cyclone-water-logging-in-mumbai-after-heavy-rains/story-BydcCunmfipvioiE4ImHWJ.html

However, heavy rains are expected in many parts of the state,” said Kishorraje Nimbalkar, secretary, relief, and rehabilitation.The state authorities have deployed 20 teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) for relief and rescue operations in the affected areas along the Maharashtra coast.“Relief and rescue measures are on. We’re assessing the damage and the report will be ready in another two-three days,” Nimbalkar said. The cyclone has left behind a trail of destruction, especially in Raigad district, where power cables are snapped, trees and electric poles uprooted, thatched, kutcha and pucca houses destroyed or partially damaged and roads blocked. A preliminary assessment by the state authorities has revealed that 1,865 kutcha houses are fully damaged, 5,577 partially damaged, 108 pucca houses fully damaged and another 560 partially damaged. Besides, 1,375 hutments are damaged in the seven coastal districts, where the alert was sounded. Sachidanand Gawde, NDRF, Pune, said that relief and rescue operations are on.“Two additional teams have been shifted to Raigad district, where cyclone Nisarga made landfall, from Mumbai and Thane. These teams are helping the district authorities in the restoration of essential services such as facilitating the movement of vehicular traffic that was disrupted due to road blockades and also the power supply. The teams will be stationed in the district until normalcy is restored,” Gawde said.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has directed the officials to assess the losses while focusing on relief and rescue measures. “Cyclone Nisarga hit coastal Maharashtra while the state is battling the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) epidemic.

This comes a day after the Gurugram police on Wednesday removed barricades at 11 border crossing points to the national capital and said commuters can now travel between the two cities without any restrictions. The Gurugram police checked movement passes until 9.30 am on Wednesday, which led to congestion for nearly 20 minutes before they received orders to remove the barricades. Those who did not have movement passes were stopped from entering Delhi. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday announced the sealing of the national capital’s borders with Uttar Pradesh and Haryana for a week. “Delhi borders to be sealed for the next one week. Essential services are exempted. We will take a decision again in one week to open borders after suggestions from citizens,” said the chief minister.Kejriwal also called for public suggestion on the matter and gave out a number and an email address for people to send in their suggestions by June 5.“Delhiites can send suggestions on opening of borders to WhatsApp number 8800007722, delhicm.suggestions@gmail.com by Friday 5 pm,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-steps-in-to-end-chaos-at-delhi-borders-tells-government-to-decide-on-common-policy-with-up-and-haryana/story-5k21lzruSqIKZhToo5GMwK.html

Maulvi Mohammed also has deep links with the Lashkar-e-Taiba, counter-terror officials in Kabul said.As part of the blueprint drawn up in Pakistan’s Rawalpindi, a counter-terror official in Delhi said ISI officials have created the financial and logistic support network to facilitate their operations. ISI officials were also present at a recent meeting convened by Taliban shadow governor in Kunar province Ahmadullah with top Lashkar and Taliban operatives.The revelation comes days after a sanctions monitoring team of the UN Security Council spotlighted the role of the 6,000-6,500 foreign fighters who had been inducted into Afghanistan. The UNSC report estimated the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba had about 800 fighters operating with Taliban forces in Mohmand Darah, Dur Baba and Sherzad Districts of Nangarhar Province and the Jaish-e-Mohammed, 200. The Lashkar had another 220 fighters and the Jaish, 30 more, in Kunar province.Security officials in Kabul said the ISI’s emphasis on pushing the Lashkar and Jaish terrorists came after the 29 February pact between the Taliban and the United States Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad. The agreement provided for withdrawal of United States forces drawdown in exchange for Taliban counter-terrorism measures, exchanges of prisoners between the Taliban and the Government of Afghanistan and other steps to reach a permanent ceasefire.“The infiltration of the Lashkar, Jaish terrorists is the ISI’s joint backup plan with the Taliban. They can both claim to be working for peace in Afghanistan and yet, keep the pot boiling,” a diplomatic source in Kabul told Hindustan Times.The terror groups have hit the ground running. Officials said the two groups have been carrying out operations in the bordering districts of Kunar, Nuristan and Nangarhar provinces along the Durand Line.The relocated Lashkar groups have organised attacks in Afghan cities and ambushed border security posts of the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces in coordination with the Taliban, its sword arm the Haqqani Network and Al Qaeda.There is a continuing effort to increase their numbers. In the last week of May, a source told Hindustan Times, a group of 30 Lashkar cadres had moved into Dangam district of Kunar province.They were led by Bilal alias Zarqawi, an ex-ISI officer who had been in charge of a major terror training centre in Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir as well as for the Jalalabad operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-isi-helps-lashkar-jaish-expand-footprint-in-afghanistan-under-backup-plan/story-m7ZjGSXqvqt0MKEPBnGaLO.html
04-06-2020||India||Uproar after J&K govt expresses ‘intention’ of opening schools amid Covid pandemic||There is widespread resentment in Jammu and Kashmir against the school education department after it recently expressed the government’s ‘intention’ to reopen schools in mid-June amid the coronavirus pandemic. After backlash, the administration stated that the instructions were issued to only ensure sanitization of school premises in view of Covid-19 and not to open schools.Parents of school students in Kashmir are aghast, many say that the decision is not only idiotic but will prove extremely dangerous, putting children’s lives at stake.Also read: India’s single-day Covid-19 spike crosses another grim milestone, 260 fatalities in 24 hours“What is the logic of opening schools when every day more than 100 people are testing positive for Covid-19. Even the shops and markets are still closed. How can we put the life of our children in risk,” said Ateeqa Begum, 45, mother of three school-going children.“Are the officials okay with making our children soft targets? It seems some officials want to score some points for their own benefits,” she said.On Monday, School Education Department’s Director Finance in a communiqué stated that the ‘government intends to re-open schools in mid of June’ and asked the concerned authorities to ensure all safety measures to arrest the spread of coronavirus among students and teachers.“In this connection, necessary instructions may be circulated to the heads of all government schools to provide a pair of reusable mask and a pair of hand gloves to every student and ensure availability of bulk hand sanitiser and liquid soap dispenser at the entry point of each school,” the communication, directed to directors of school education of Jammu and Kashmir divisions stated.People on social media were also wary of the decision which comes at a time when the number of Covid-19 cases in Jammu and Kashmir has crossed 2,700 and the death toll has reached 33.“Reopening of schools is not as easy as it is made to appear. One thing is clear, parents will never risk the lives of their children by sending them to schools in the middle of the worsening coronavirus crisis, no matter how much “academic loss” it entails or whatever it means,” said Faheem Aslam, a Srinagar resident.“While babus are out with circulars suggesting reopening of Kashmir schools this month, they are mum on explaining the rationale behind rushing through the decision to the anguished parents… Expecting school children to undertake social distancing and follow safety protocols, when top officers and doctors are falling prey to the deadly virus, is nothing but idiocy,” he said.Calls to commissioner secretary education Asgar Samoon and director school education Younis Malik went unanswered. Advisor to Lt Governor, KK Sharma said in a statement said that J&K government has not taken any decision to open schools on June 15. “However instructions have been issued to schools to ensure sanitization of school premises in view of Covid 19,” he said.Dr Jitendra Singh, Minister of State in Prime Minister’s Office, said in a tweet that he has asked the J&K administration to defer the decision of opening schools. “Have spoken to #JammuAndKashmir UT Government and suggested that decisions regarding 1) Vehicle Registeration Tax and 2) Reopening of schools may be deferred,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uproar-after-j-k-govt-expresses-intention-of-opening-schools-amid-covid-pandemic/story-c4cQggMiy2hrZAw5cEcxXK.html

This was the first meeting of the CPI(M) politburo after the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24.Yechury said the state governments that are in the forefront of the battle against Covid-19 were denied even their legitimate dues such as the GST payout.He alleged that the pandemic is being used for centralisation of authority, which, in turn, is destroying a basic feature of the Constitution -- federalism.“A unitary state is being created by the Modi government that will facilitate the disruption of the secular democratic republic of India and transition of the RSS political project of a theocratic state,” Yechury said.The CPI(M) politburo statement said the Gross Tax Revenues (GTR) have fallen by over Rs 70,000 crore and the Corporate Tax Revenue (CTR) by over Rs 1,06,000 crore.“This shortfall in governmental revenues will reduce the share of the states who are already starved of finances,” it added.Yechury said the lockdown was imposed arbitrarily and lifted unscientifically.The all-India protest to be observed on June 16 is to raise key demands, including an immediate cash transfer of Rs 7,500 per month for a period of six months to all families outside the income-tax paying bracket, free distribution of 10 kg of foodgrains per individual per month for six months, expansion of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) from the current 100 days to 200 days with enhanced wages.“Extend the employment guarantee scheme to cover the urban poor. Immediately announce an unemployment allowance for unemployed persons,” Yechury said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpi-m-to-stage-countrywide-protests-on-june-16-demanding-cash-transfers-free-foodgrains-to-poor/story-kBxVik6UFv8lHBvFWl3UdN.html

Remove mask, show face to CCTV camera in this Uttarakhand town||In a town in Uttarakhand’s US Nagar district, you will get petrol during the night only if you show your face before a CCTV camera and call a number. The exercise has been introduced by the police in Pulbhatta area of US Nagar to check incidents of loot, an official said.Three bike-borne people looted Rs 7.5-lakh from a petrol pump in Bazpur on Monday. Three months ago, some people in a car had looted cash and a double-barrel gun from security guard from a petrol pump under Pulbhatta police station.“Customers come at petrol pump to fill oil only in an emergency or to commit crime at night. Most people fill the petrol or diesel during day time. If they come at night, they will have to show their faces before CCTV and call from their mobile at certain mobile number mentioned at petrol pump’s wall,” said Vinod Joshi, in-charge, police station, Pulbhatta.He said that the salesmen will stay in the fuesl station’s cabin and will ask the customer to follow these two exercises. He will come out to provide oil only after customers act upon his words, he said.Pulbhatta is a sensitive area and close to Bareilly district of Uttar Pradesh, which is also a crime-prone district. Around 10 petrol pumps fall on Bareilly highway in Pulbhatta area, said official.A meeting of petrol pump owners was held in the police station on Tuesday evening and the cops explained them about the precautionary measures to be followed to avoid robbery like crime at petrol pumps at night.They were asked to install and maintain CCTV cameras, and provide fuel only after customer shows his face and call by his mobile at the number mentioned at station’s wall.“Due to Covid-19 outbreak, customers are wearing masks. In such a condition, if someone commits a crime it becomes difficult to identify him. If they remove masks CCTV will record faces. Calling by one’s mobile will be helpful for us to trace criminal through surveillance in case of some crime,” said Joshi.He said that besides this, the fuel station owners will daily obtain mobile number of night officer of the police station and their salesmen will inform him time to time status of the petrol pump.Vishal Madan, Reliance petrol pump owner, hailed the exercise taken by police.“This exercise of police is for the safety of our pump and staff. We have started following norms explained by Pulbhatta police. Our staff will remain in the contact of night officer and get help immediately in case of any untoward incident and in case any if scuffle takes place between customers and our staff,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/want-petrol-remove-mask-show-face-to-cctv-camera-in-this-uttarakhand-town/story-WYiqmFlTFstTwsUenoYJdI.html

04-06-2020||India||India’s Covid-19 cases will cross 15,000-mark a day by mid-June: China study||India is likely to witness a steady rise in Covid-19 cases in June with the daily increase crossing 15,000-a-day by the middle of the month, a global forecast model for the coronavirus pandemic prepared by Chinese researchers has predicted.Established by Lanzhou university in northwest China’s Gansu province, the “Global Covid-19 Predict System” makes daily forecasts for 180 countries.The research group’s forecast model for India for June 2 had predicted 9,291 new confirmed cases in India; Indian government official data put the increase – the biggest yet for a single day – at 8,909 cases in the last 24 hours.From Wednesday onwards, the model predicts 9676, 10,078, 10,498 and 10,936 daily new cases for the next four days.Another example: India on Friday reported 7,467 new cases of the coronavirus disease for May 28 (Thursday).“For May 28, we had predicted 7,607 new cases of Covid-19 in India, which is close to the reported number. Our prediction is at an initial stage. Error analysis will soon be updated on our website,” Huang Jianping, director of Lanzhou University’s Collaborative Innovation Center of Western Ecological Safety, who is heading the project told HT.By June 15, India could see more than 15,000 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 every day.India has recorded more than 8,000 cases for three consecutive days with the total number of infections now at over 2,00,000.The same system predicts that the US will see a daily increase of 30,000 new cases in June and major countries in Europe will witness a continuous drop in new daily cases.The dynamic forecasting model, which was unveiled online last week, takes into account the impact of climate and environmental conditions, population densities as well as control measures implemented by governments.“The spread of the virus is affected by many factors, including population density, quarantine measures, and of course the environmental factors,” Huang said.“Different factors contribute differently in different regions in the world.Meteorological factors can affect the spread of the virus. We believe it is necessary to consider the impact of temperature and humidity, although the degree of their influence varies in different regions,” Huang, the project leader, said.“For India, the high population density reduces the social distance and is conducive to the development of pandemic. The influence of temperature is limited, compared with other factors,” he said.Experts say that the number of new cases in India will rise as the government gradually eases the lockdown.“Before the release of the system, repeated verification and debugging were carried out. There are many factors affecting the development of the Covid-19, and we will continue to adjust and improve it according to the actual situation,” Huang said.The Centre’s prediction model is based on statistical epidemiology model and in the data in the model construction such as the number of confirmed cases and the death toll are from US’s Johns Hopkins University. Meteorological data such as temperature and humidity were taken from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and NASA. According to the research, usually the temperature most conducive for the spread of the novel coronavirus is between 5 degrees Celsius and 15 degrees Celsius, with 60 percent of the Covid-19 cases around the world reported within the temperature scope.“Our previous study found that 60 percent of the confirmed cases of Covid-19 occurred in places where the air temperature ranged from 5 °C to 15 °C, with a peak in cases at 11.54 °C and approximately 73.8 percent of the confirmed cases were concentrated in regions with absolute humidity of 3 g/m3 to 10 g/m3.”The content of nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere is taken into account as it is related to vehicular exhaust.According to Huang, if the nitrogen dioxide content is less in the atmosphere, it means non-pharmaceutical measures like lockdowns and restrictions on transport have been effective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-cases-will-cross-15-000-mark-a-day-by-mid-june-china-study/story-mr4tOIDck1HoyH5EkTsdiN.html
04-06-2020||India||‘At an existential level, time has suddenly collapsed into itself’||When I asked her, S said the first thing she would do when the lockdown was lifted, was go for a long walk in the park near her house.M said she would get her hair cutA said she would visit a friendH said she would rush to the office R said she would have the family over for lunchK said she wasn’t waiting around for that, she’d already written her Will.I’ve been reading that wonderful writer, Grace Paley’s, short stories these lockdown days, as well as another little book she made with a friend called, Long Walks and Intimate Talks. While they walk, they talk about all sorts of things, among them about happiness. Her friend says, that “what she means by happiness was having (or having had) (or continuing to have) everything. By everything she meant, first, the children, then a dear person to live with...”, and this is followed by a list of what her heart desires most.I think I know what she means because that’s just how I’ve been feeling about opening the locks to life and the world outside again. About being normal.By normal I mean not jerking awake in the middle of the night, in a cold sweat, because I dreamt I was boarding a flight — without a mask on.By normal I mean going for a long walk with a friend, anywhere and at any time of the day or night, and discussing at the widest, deepest, and most hopeless level, the state of the world, the venality of politicians, the stupidity of RWAs, the incompetence of governments, the loss of a loved one, the brilliance of Ondaatje’s Warlight — without having to remain two arm lengths away from each other.By normal I mean walking into the office, sitting at my table, leafing through the mail, or the proofs, talking to colleagues, meeting authors, without worrying about whether I might be infecting them, or they me — or each other.By normal I mean being able to look some distance into the future, say a few months or till the end of the year, confident that it’s likely to continue in as reassuringly predictable way, as before.By normal I mean not being pulled up short by the realisation that tomorrow might dawn terrifyingly different from today.But Time’s axis has shifted. It has become relative. In a mundane, everyday kind of way it is expansive and leisurely, almost indulgent. Nothing is urgent. I am not bound by a routine that is regulated by my watch. I edit mss., read proofs, correspond with authors, discuss projects, in the knowledge that none of these are going anywhere in a hurry — at least for the “foreseeable” future. I’m not rushing to publish a lot of books, to make up for lost time (there’s a thought, time that has been lost in lockdown) because there is a serious question mark hovering over sales. Who will buy? Will people rush out to buy books just because they have been confined, or will they have had their fill of reading already, because they could do so little else? Maybe the last thing they will want to do is pick up another book. Let’s give book production a bit of a rest, I think.But at an existential level, time has suddenly collapsed into itself. Is no longer measurable, because — will I even be around to see those books published if I don’t hurry up and get them out? Shouldn’t I be accelerating instead of slowing down? What if I run out of time?In between the mundane and the existential is yet another impulse, that of pretending that I can, in the short term, exercise some control over the time at hand. I can pretend that, really, nothing much has changed, everything will settle down, so I should carry on regardless, because time will — if I can hold out for long enough — resume its normal rhythm, and life will resume its normal tenor. I can pretend that if I, personally, carry on as if there had never been a lockdown, then I will be able to turn the clock back, and no time will have been lost.But that will be tilting at windmills. And so I manoeuvre myself into that tiny space, that sliver of time between lockdown and post-lockdown, whenever that might be, to think and plan for a week at a time, which seems to me a good compromise between the everyday and the existential. As for normal, it looks like I might be wishing for too much and too little at the same time for, as Grace says, “everywhere vast public suffering rises in reeling waves from around the earth’s nation-states”.Ritu Menon is a feminist writer and publisher.

04-06-2020||India||Frequent cyclones linked to climate crisis||The severe cyclonic storm which made landfall south of Alibag in Maharashtra’s Raigad district on Wednesday at 11.30 am is an indication of an increasing frequency of severe cyclones developing in Arabian Sea in the past decade, a trend that studies have linked to climate change.In the past two years, there have been seven cyclones in the Arabian Sea, though, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the ratio of cyclones in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal — which just witnessed the destructive cyclone Amphan on May 21 — is 1:4.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) last year came out with a special report, Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, in which it said that extreme rainfall and extreme sea level events associated with some tropical cyclones are being seen to have a cascading impact on coastal areas.“There is emerging evidence for an increase in annual global proportion of Category 4 or 5 tropical cyclones in recent decades,” the IPCC report had said.A category 4 cyclone has a wind speed of 209-251 kmph, and is referred to as an extremely severe cyclonic storm, while a category 5 cyclone has a wind speed of more than 252 kmph, and is referred to as a super cyclone. The IPCC report refers to a 2017 study led by Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program, Princeton University, USA, which found that in 2014 and 2015, post-monsoon extremely severe cyclonic storms (ESCS) were first observed over the Arabian Sea causing widespread damage.The study had concluded that climate change had led to an increase in the occurrence of ESCSs in the Arabian Sea. “The effect of climate change on Cyclone Nisarga, my answer is “uncertain”. Our research suggests that cyclones would be more frequent during the post monsoon season (October-December) by a series climate model simulations. However, we didn’t find any significant changes in cyclone activity during the pre-monsoon (April-June) season through the climate simulations. It is very difficult to identify if a cyclone (like Nisarga) is generated in line with climate change,” said Hiroyuki Murakami, Project Scientist, University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Murakami is the lead author of the study.“Rising mean sea levels will contribute to higher extreme sea levels associated with tropical cyclones (very high confidence). Coastal hazards will be exacerbated by an increase in the average intensity, magnitude of storm surge and precipitation rates of tropical cyclones,” the IPCC report further stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/frequent-cyclones-linked-to-climate-crisis/story-aROrjNelKKBYWNoXGXGAVJ.html
04-06-2020||India||No major impact in Gujarat due to Cyclone Nisarga, say officials||Cyclone Nisarga did not cause any major damage in Gujarat after making landfall in Maharashtra on Wednesday, officials said. Gujarat relief commissioner Harshad Patel said, “The situation in Gujarat is under control. No casualties have been reported. The administration is fully equipped in the potentially affected coastal districts of Gujarat. All activities are being constantly monitored by chief minister Vijay Rupani with the determination of zero casualty during cyclone.”He said around 63,798 people, including 252 pregnant women, from eight districts of south Gujarat and Saurashtra have been evacuated. Patel added that the state government was vigilant at the 332 shelters considering the high number of cases of the coronavirus disease in the state. “Nisarga has hit Alibag in Raigad district of Maharashtra this afternoon. The wind speed of the cyclone was 80 to 100 km per hour...wind is likely to reduce to 60 to 90 km per hour in Valsad and surrounding areas.... Six teams of SDRF and 18 teams of NDRF have been deployed in the respective districts of the state,” Patel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-major-impact-in-gujarat-due-to-cyclone-nisarga-say-officials/story-A6P6F7BW0E4PUboxPfcFGL.html
04-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What you must know every day||“Behind this mask there is more than just flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea... and ideas are bulletproof.”That’s Alan Moore in V for Vendetta, and it’s only apt that a column on masks starts with a Moore-ism.The Guy Fawkes masks worn by V in the book (and then in the underwhelming movie of the same name) became the symbol of resistance and protests after being adopted by the fragmented Occupy movement in the early 2010s. Everyone was suddenly wearing one.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThere’s another connection too. We’ve always associated masks with superheroes – with the extraordinary. And Moore created the greatest superhero comic ever, Watchmen, along with illustrator Dave Gibbons.The coronavirus disease has changed our perception of masks – despite claims through March and even some part of April that they weren’t really necessary. And this wasn’t only in the US; India’s health ministry too maintained that line for some time.Now, everybody wears masks. You don’t have to be extraordinary, or a deviant, or a thief, or want to hide your identity to do so. They have become the uniform of the ordinary. Science has established beyond doubt that Covid-19 is primarily transmitted from person to person, and through exhalations. Sure, one can also be infected by fomites (objects and surfaces carrying the infection – usually left there by an infected person) but the chances of this are much lower. Masks, then, are a must for anyone who doesn’t have super powers that give them immunity from the Sars-CoV-2. Kal-El may be immune; we aren’t.By everybody, I mean everybody sensible. There are idiots who do not wear a mask, or do not wear it all the time when in public, or do not wear it properly – risking not just themselves but others around them as well. A recent study in the Indian Journal of Medical Research says that around 28% of approximately 40,000 people who tested positive for the coronavirus disease in India till April 30 were asymptomatic – with the caveat that the proportion could be higher. In the US, for instance, it is accepted that this proportion is around a third. Worse still, we have learned that even people who show symptoms (eventually) can infect people long before they do so.There’s only one way to deal with such irresponsible people – give them a wide berth.Apart from helping us stay safe, masks have also, at least in the short term, restored our anonymity.Facial recognition algorithms have, for now, been stymied by masks, although, in theory, this is a problem that can be solved as they get more data (which, in this case, will be the selfies of their masked selves that people are so obligingly posting on social media).Despite everything the creators of these technologies claim, many still continue to have problems with people of colour, Asians, and women. Now, masks, which will continue to be used widely for years (perhaps forever, one part of my brain suggests) have made it even more difficult for them.Technology will solve the problem in time; it usually does. But enjoy your anonymity in the meantime. It can be liberating.While on the subject of masks, they can be symbols of other things too, as pointed out by a man some consider the US’s first major African American poet, Paul Laurence Dunbar. His poem, “We Wear The Mask”, published in the late 1890s in a collection titled Lyrics of Lowly Life, is perhaps even more apt today, given what’s happening in that country. Here’s its opening part:We wear the mask that grins and lies,It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,—This debt we pay to human guile;With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,And mouth with myriad subtleties.Why should the world be over-wise,In counting all our tears and sighs?Nay, let them only see us, whileWe wear the mask.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-must-know-every-day/story-sI5RldQRB7zf9YKHYACFDK.html
04-06-2020||India||US launches probe into digital tax||The US on Tuesday started an investigation into taxes on digital services in effect or being considered in other countries and their impact on American businesses, which could lead to retaliatory trade actions and open up potentially another front in India’s persisting trade differences with Washington.The government imposed a new tax of 2% in April on digital services rendered in India against payments collected abroad. The levy is restricted to non-resident companies and is expected to chiefly affect American digital services giants Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon. People familiar with developments said New Delhi has no plans to change its levy. “These investigations are just the start of a process. It’s not as if some actions have already been taken by the US,” said one of the people. “Everything will depend on the findings of the investigations. So, it’s too early to say.” Other countries that have levied this tax or are considering them are Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, the European Union, Indonesia, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and the UK. Most of them are allies of the US.“President Trump is concerned that many of our trading partners are adopting tax schemes designed to unfairly target our companies,” said Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative and America’s top trade negotiator, in a statement announcing the investigation. “We are prepared to take all appropriate action to defend our businesses and workers against any such discrimination.”The investigation has been launched under Section 301 of the Trade Act, 1974, the same provision that was used by the Trump administration to slap an additional 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of imports from China in 2018, triggering a trade war between the world’s two largest economies.Any potential action against India would add to a list of trade differences that the two countries have tried to reconcile despite pressure mounted in recent years by President Donald Trump through public and private exhortation. Trump ended India’s special trade status last summer. Amit Maheshwari, a partner at AKM Global, a tax and consulting firm, said: “The US investigation will focus on whether the digital services taxes (DSTs) discriminate against US companies, they are retroactive, and they reflect unreasonable tax policy, which would be when the DSTs may diverge from norms reflected in the US tax system and the international tax system in several respects such as extra-territoriality, taxing revenue not income, and a purpose of penalising particular technology companies for their commercial success.”“The Indian tax, which is the subject of this investigation, was rushed in the recent Finance Act and made into law from April 1, 2020, without consultations and gave little time for the industry to prepare. Several countries, including India, are adopting unilateral measures in the absence of multilateral consensus spearheaded by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development . We don’t foresee global consensus anytime soon,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-launches-probe-into-digital-tax/story-MYBpr9IQGKUKi8SKmsPneJ.html

04-06-2020||India||Rs 50 crore deposited by LG Polymers to be used for eco restoration, compensating victims: NGT||The National Green Tribunal on Wednesday ordered that the amount of Rs 50 crore deposited by LG Polymers India Ltd with Andhra Pradesh government be spent for restoration of environment and for part compensation to victims of Styrene gas leak from the company’s Visakhapatnam plant, which claimed 12 lives on May 7.A three-member bench of the tribunal headed by Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said the final quantum of compensation to be paid by the company will be decided by a committee comprising representatives from the ministry of environment and forests (MoEF), central pollution control board (CPCB) and national environmental engineering research institute (NEERI) to be constituted within two weeks.The tribunal suggested that another committee comprising two representatives each from MoEF, CPCB and three representatives of state government be formed to work out the restoration plan in the affected villages within two months.The NGT bench asked the Andhra Pradesh government to take action against the officials responsible for permitting South Korean firm LG Polymers India Ltd to operate its plant at Visakhapatnam without statutory licences.It observed that the company had not obtained environmental clearance and the state pollution control board, on account of its ignorance of law or otherwise, gave the ‘Consent to Establish’ and ‘Consent to Operate’ in violation of law.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The bench said the LG Polymers has absolute liability for the environmental damage and consequential loss, including to life and public health, due to leakage of Styrene vapour. It said the government could go ahead with any criminal or other statutory proceedings against the company in accordance with the law.The bench ordered the state chief secretary to take action against those who had given permission to the company to operate and submit the action taken report within two months. The case was posted to November 3 for further hearings.The tribunal also ordered that the company cannot recommence its operations without requisite statutory clearances which could be given only after the examination of the tribunal.It also suggested that the environment ministry constitutes an expert committee to suggest ways and means to prevent violation of environmental norms and recurrence of such incidents in future. It asked the ministry to submit an action taken report within three months.The tribunal, quoting the reports of the expert committee, observed that the LG Polymers India and its Korean principal LG Chem betrayed lack of experience in monitoring and maintaining full tanks of Styrene that had been lying idle for several weeks without operation because of lockdown.“Even the storage tank from which the gas leaked was of old design and this possibly contributed to the problem. Operators and any industrial persons are not aware of control measures in such a situation is the main cause,” the NGT said.The LG Polymers did not present their version, except arguing that the NGT had no powers to take up the case suo motu, as the issue was pending in the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-50-crore-deposited-by-lg-polymers-to-be-used-for-eco-restoration-compensating-victims-ngt/story-Bj6hsvK83UhGRtD88Ta6IP.html
04-06-2020||India||Team from petroleum ministry visits Assam OIL well blowout site||Eight days after a natural gas well operated by Oil India Limited (OIL) witnessed a blowout in Assam’s Tinsukia district, a union petroleum ministry team reached the site to take stock of the situation on Wednesday.Amar Nath, joint secretary in the ministry of petroleum and natural gas reached Baghjan, where natural gas and oil condensate from the well has been flowing “uncontrollably” since May 27.A blowout is uncontrolled release of crude oil or gas from a well when pressure control systems fail. Condensate is a low density high gravity hydrocarbon generally found along with natural gas.Nath took a review meeting at Tinsukia, which was attended by Sanjay Kishan, Assam tea tribes’ welfare minister, district officials, forest and pollution department officials as well as senior OIL executives.In a statement issued on Wednesday, OIL informed that a two-member team of experts from Singapore-based Alert Disaster Control is expected to reach the site on Thursday to help control the blowout.“Pumping of water to the well through the casing valve is in progress to minimize chances of fire. Testing of equipment required for controlling of the well is in progress,” the statement read.To ensure that there is adequate and continuous supply of water while the process to control the blowout is underway, a reservoir is being dug up near the well and a pipeline being laid from a nearby river.The blowout happened at the Baghjan well while work was underway to produce gas from a new oil and gas bearing reservoir at a depth of 3,729 metres. Natural gas and oil condensate has been flowing from the well continuously.Around 1610 families have been evacuated from the areas near the well and have been shifted to four relief camps.Since the well is located close to the Dibru Saikhowa National Park and the eco-sensitive Maguri wetland, wildlife and environment activists in Assam have expressed concern of long term damage to ecology and wildlife if the blow out is not contained soon.Residue of the condensate has spread to areas near the well and trees, water bodies and roofs of houses are covered in a thin oil-like layer.“All safety and security measures are continuously being monitored to protect surrounding villagers and their properties, working teams. Protection of environment would be paramount while carrying out the well control operation,” said the OIL statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/team-from-petroleum-ministry-visits-assam-oil-well-blowout-site/story-Y6R2HcAuUdFzUzlhzWTbqK.html
04-06-2020||India||Kerala CM, junior minister spar over evacuation of expatriates amid spike in Covid-19 cases||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday refuted Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan’s charge that the state wants to go slow on evacuation of expatriates and limit the number of flights from the middle-eastern countries.“We neither put any condition nor sought go- slow on this. I don’t know why people holding responsible positions are creating such confusion. I heard the union government had some problem in dispatching too many flights,” the CM said while asked about his statement.After the union minister’s statement there was outrage in the state and the Congress-led opposition parties had launched an agitation against the state government. At least 160 people from the state died in the Middle-East due to Covid-19 in the last three months and they held the government responsible for this.When contacted Muraleedharan reiterated his charges: “I stand by what I said. Let the CM first read letters he sent to the Centre. The state government had expressed its inability to make arrangements to receive more passengers. If need be, I can furnish copies of the letter he sent,” he said adding the Union government was ready to fly 24 flights daily to evacuate stranded people in the Gulf. Hailing from the state, earlier, the minister had questioned the low testing rates of Kerala and accused the CM of fudging data to maintain the record. It is a fact when comparing to other states, Kerala’s testing rates are poor-- 71,303 tests as on May 3 whereas its neighbours Tamil Nadu and Karnataka had crossed 2.50 lakh tests.Meanwhile the state reported 82 fresh Covid-19 cases taking the total number of cases to 1,494. Out of 82 cases, 53 are expatriates, 19 came from other states and others transmitted locally, said the CM adding 832 people are undergoing treatment in hospitals. Among the infected are five health workers. The state had reported 12 deaths so far. At least, 32 medical workers including 19 doctors have been asked to proceed on quarantine after an accident victim who died on Tuesday tested positive for coronavirus in Thiruvananthapuram. This is the first time such a large number of medical workers are in quarantine in the state since the pandemic began in January.A 77-year-old priest Father K G Verghese who was undergoing treatment after a road accident died of Covid-19 on Tuesday. After the accident in April, he was admitted to a local hospital and later shifted to the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College Hospital after his condition worsened. Nobody including his family members have any idea how he contracted the disease and officials say it is difficult to identify his contacts now.“Sharp rise in cases is a real concern. After the return of expatriates and people stranded in other parts of the country we expected a hike. Imported cases are OK; we can’t do anything in such cases. But we have to ensure local transmission is not taking place,” said Health Minister K K Shailaja adding doctors’ quarantine will not affect functioning of hospitals. In April, Kerala was on the verge of flattening the virus curve but cases escalated after the return of expatriates and others. Kerala was the first state to report a coronavirus case in the country in January-- a China-returned medical student. Though testing is very low it managed the disease well with high recovery and low mortality rates, statistics show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-junior-minister-spar-over-evacuation-of-expatriates-amid-spike-in-covid-19-cases/story-we7LMNYJLEnCAkuqmUokZJ.html
04-06-2020||India||Top Jaish explosives expert among 3 killed||Indian security forces killed a top Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) explosives expert in Kashmir, suspected of planning a May 28 car bombing that was foiled by the vehicle’s interception, and two local terrorists in a major counter-insurgency operation on Wednesday, officials said.Abdul Rehman alias Fauji Bhai , a native of Rawalpindi in Pakistan, was an Afghan war veteran who had been active in South Kashmir since 2017, the officials said.“This operation was based on human intelligence inputs and all three militants killed in the operation were affiliated with Jaish,” Jammu & Kashmir Police inspector general Vijay Kumar said, adding that the bodies of the three militants would be buried in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district.Clashes erupted near the encounter site and the police made announcements asking people to stay inside their homes and not venture out.A joint team of the army’s Rashtriya Rifles, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and Jammu & Kashmir Police killed Rehman, who also went by the name Waleed Ismail and was the JeM’s operational commander in the area, and the two other terrorists in a shoot-out in Pulwama district’s Kangan village where they had been holed up, the officials said .Vijay Kumar said Rehman planned the May 28 car bombing that failed when security forces intercepted a Santro car in Pulwama packed with explosives the previous night. The two terrorists killed along with him were identified as JeM’s district commander in Pulwama , Manzoor Kaar alias Abu Mansh, a resident of Sirnoo, and Javid Zargar of Rangmullah, another JeM commander.Inputs available with security forces, however, indicate that Rehman had built two more vehicle improvised explosive devices in Kashmir.“Our information was that Fauji Bhai... had fabricated three vehicle IEDs. We seized one of the three on May 27 but there are two more out there, possibly somewhere in Budgam and Kulgam areas,” a top counter-terrorism official told Hindustan Times, requesting anonymity.There have been several intelligence reports over the past two months about plans by Jaish terrorists to carry out major strikes targeting security forces.The Santro car packed with explosives seized by security forces on May 27 was the vehicle for the first of these planned attacks. It was intercepted when it was being taken to a Jaish terrorist, Sameer Ahmed Dar of Kakpora, Pulwama, by an associate.Sameer Dar is a relative of Adil Dar, the suicide bomber who drove his Maruti Echo vehicle into a CRPF convoy on February 14, 2019, killing 40 troopers. The attack was followed by India launching air strikes on a terror facility in Pakistan’s Balakot, and a subsequent dogfight between the air forces of the two neighbouring countries.This time, Sameer Dar offered to drive the vehicle IED into a security camp. Intelligence reports indicate that one of the likely targets of the car bomb was the 44 Rashtriya Rifles camp at Shadimarg, Rajpora, Pulwama.Initial reports had suggested that JeM’s current chief in the Kashmir valley, Mohammad Alvi alias Lambu, may have been killed in the latest encounter, but officials later said he was still at large. Alvi also goes by the name Ismail.“Groups like Jaish use many names and aliases while operating in different areas to confuse the security forces,” another counter-terrorism official said, requesting anonymity. “Lambu, who is said to have taken over the reins of Jaish in J&K after the killing of its leader Kari Yari (in January), is still on the run.”Alvi was also among the key planners of the May 28 failed car bombing and had a role to play in the February 14, 2019, suicide attack as well, as reported by HT on Tuesday.“The killing of Abdul Rehman alias Fauji Bhai, a Pakistani national, is a big success for security forces as he was a master in assembling improvised explosive devices for JeM,” Vijay Kumar told reporters.Kumar claimed that Rehman had managed to escape on May 28 when security forces intercepted the explosives- laden car, which was supposed to have been used to attack a security forces convoy or camp. “We had promised you that day we will get him soon. Today we did. Whether he was involved in 2019 car bombing attack on CRPF convoy, I cannot say for sure, but he was active in Pulwama at that time,” Kumar said.On Tuesday, two militants were killed in an encounter with security forces in Tral area of Pulwama district.The militants, who sources said were locals, were killed in a gunfight which erupted after a search operation was launched by a joint team of the state police and the army at Saimoh village. Two AK-47 assault rifles were recovered from the encounter site. Since the Covid-19 lockdown, 44 militants and two associates have been killed in encounters in Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-jaish-explosives-expert-among-3-killed/story-fCGjSeTWou5onwDuJ4crHK.html
04-06-2020||India||Cyclone Nisarga makes landfall; a lucky escape for Mumbai||Nisarga, the first severe cyclone to impact Mumbai in more than 60 years, largely spared India’s financial capital on Wednesday as the severe cyclonic storm weakened after its landfall south of the city, claiming no major damages or loss of life in the region.The cyclone crossed the coast near Alibag in Raigad district with wind speeds of up to 120km per hour at 12.30pm, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. Experts said Mumbai remained largely unaffected as the landfall, initially expected to be 16km away in Alibag, deviated 75km from the coastal resort town.Two people died as the storm uprooted trees in neighbouring districts, but no major damages were reported as workers began clearing debris on Wednesday night. The deep depression that formed over the Arabian Sea earlier this week turned into a severe cyclonic storm and reached the coastline of Maharashtra on Wednesday. “It made landfall south of Alibag. The cyclone’s eye diameter was 80km and the eye crossed south of Alibag in Raigad but rest of it crossed neighbouring districts,” said IMD director general M Mohapatra. He added that while the forecast on the cyclone track was accurate, the effect on Mumbai was diminished as the landfall happened at least 75km south of Alibag, in Diveagar.IMD’s prediction of extremely heavy rainfall was not reported in several areas of Mumbai. The city, however, recorded a gale wind speed of 72kmph at its southern tip, Colaba, quelling fears that the administrative and health care resources, already stretched on account of its coronavirus disease (Covid-19) caseload, would not be able to cope with a natural disaster.Private forecaster Skymet Weather said it was a close shave for the city, which has so far recorded about 43,000 Covid-19 cases and is making attempts at keeping its health care system from being overrun. “Our observation is that the impact on Mumbai was less because the landfall location was shifted somewhat south of Alibag. There was only light to moderate rains in Mumbai during and immediately after landfall,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate and meteorology at Skymet Weather.Visuals of lacerating rain, swaying trees and waves crashing against tetrapod barriers that line the Konkan coast beamed on television screens as people stayed indoors on the advice of the state government, even as teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the State Disaster Response Force evacuated at least 160,000 people over Tuesday and Wednesday morning from the coastal districts of Maharashtra — particularly Raigad and Palghar — as well as Navsari, Valsad and Surat in Gujarat.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and his deputy Ajit Pawar spoke to district collectors of all seven districts on alert in Maharashtra, and directed the administration to assess the losses to citizens.Kishorraje Nimbalkar, secretary, relief and rehabilitation said: “The alert continues till tomorrow [Thursday] morning in seven districts. There are huge losses of properties reported in Raigad district, while in other districts it was comparatively less. There is no cyclone-related loss of life reported in the state. The assessment of the losses will begin tomorrow.”As it passed over the coastline, Nisarga spanned 500km, as captured by radar and encompassed Mumbai and Thane districts, IMD stated. Its eye (the region of calm at the centre of a cyclonic storm) was about 80km in diameter — by all measures, it was every bit the severe cyclonic storm that the states were bracing for. However, cyclones tend to lose speed the more they travel inland, and by Wednesday night, Nisarga made its way towards Pune and was headed in the north-east direction towards Madhya Pradesh at a speed of 60-70kmph.The cyclone made landfall between Srivardhan and Murud to the south of Alibag, Raigad district collector Nidhi Choudhari said. Though the cyclone completed landfall between 12.30 and 2.30pm, its intensity lasted for another hour afterwards. Alibag received 84.3mm of rain between 8.30am and 5.30pm on Wednesday, while Ratnagiri district, south of the cyclone’s landfall site, recorded 45mm in the same time period, according to data provided by the district administration.“The entire district is cyclone-hit,” Choudhari said, as she assessed the extent of damage with the NDRF team on Wednesday evening. “It struck us exactly at Diveagar, and later moved towards Alibag and Pen tehsils. The impact was felt as far as Margaon, Khopoli and Karjat (inland) where tree and electric lines were badly damaged.” Choudhari estimated at least 10,000 trees were affected — 15 in her own office and residence, she said.A 58-year-old man died in Alibag’s Umte village when an electricity pole fell on him, and four people were injured in Ratnagiri district. Another death was reported from Raigad district, a 10-year-old who was killed due to a tree fall. The cyclone uprooted a large number of trees. Power supply was affected in most coastal districts and tenements with missing tin roofs, blown away by the high speed winds, was a common sight.In anticipation of flooding, on account of a predicted storm surge, the Birhanmumbai Municipal Corporation evacuated close to 20,000 people from low-lying areas in the metropolitan region, including Colaba, Worli Koliwada, Gorai and other western suburbs. This was to be the second severe cyclonic storm after 1961 to impact Mumbai in its path. However, as of Wednesday night, no major loss to life and property reported.The Chhattrapati Shivaji International airport, which shut operations for three hours during the day, resumed flights at 6pm.“This could have been very bad. Winds were very strong but rainfall was moderate, which probably saved Mumbai. We do not expect any major rains anymore,” Mumbai’s deputy director general of meteorology KS Hosalikar said. “We may withdraw the orange alert for Mumbai and only keep a yellow alert,” he added.Sunita Devi, incharge of cyclone department at IMD, said: “Unlike Amphan, this cyclone didn’t intensify rapidly while in the ocean but intensified very quickly when it was only 250km from the Maharashtra coast as winds picked by 20 to 40kmph early morning on Wednesday and made landfall as a severe cyclonic storm.”Climate scientist at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Mathew Roxy Koll, said: “Intensification from a tropical cyclone to a Category 1 cyclone in case of Nisarga happened in about 12 hours near the coast.” His team said that this was the first time after 1998 that a severe cyclonic storm crossed the west coast. The 1998 cyclone made landfall in Gujarat’s Kandla and killed thousands of people but didn’t impact Mumbai. It is rare for a cyclone to make landfall in or near Mumbai or even on the Maharashtra coast. The storms that form during monsoon onset over Arabian Sea usually move towards Oman. Cyclone Phyan, of a much lower intensity, last impacted these districts in 2009 and even Mumbai recorded extremely heavy rainfall. The upper-level winds steered Nisarga towards the Maharashtra coast. This is the first pre-monsoon severe cyclone to have made an impact on Mumbai since 1961.Storm surge during the three-hour cyclone period ranged between 1-2m for the Konkan coast. The maximum storm surge for Raigad district was 2m from Alibag to Diveagar, and 0-0.8m for Ratnagiri, Mumbai and Thane.Storm surge warnings — shoreward movement of water above astronomical tide height under the action of wind stress — indicate the extent of inundation to expect. A storm surge of 0.5m to 1.3m over coastal Alibag may result in flooding up to 1.4km of a low-lying area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-makes-landfall-a-lucky-escape-for-mumbai/story-H0n7a8w0d7q7OaHl94AigI.html
04-06-2020||India||Over 85mn gas cylinders have been availed under Gareeb Kalyan Yojana: Dharmendra Pradhan||Union Petroleum and steel minister Dharmendra Pradhan spoke to Rajeev Jayaswal about the challenge of delivering cooking gas cylinders to 274 million consumers during the lockdown period, the impact of the rise and fall in crude oil prices, the push for energy security, new supply contracts with the US and Russia, and the role public and private players in the oil sector, among other issues. Edited excerpts:Soon after the national lockdown to check the spread of Covid-19 began, the government announced that it would give free cooking gas cylinders to poor households for three months. What is the progress?The government has proposed to give free refills for PMUY (Prime Minister Ujjwala Yojana) consumers for a period of three months with financial assistance of Rs 13,500 crore. The scheme has been operational since April 1. As on May 31, Rs 8,494 crore have been transferred to the bank account of beneficiaries though DBT (direct benefit transfer). And the beneficiaries have availed the delivery of 852.49 lakh (over 85 million) cylinders under the PM Gareeb Kalyan Yojana.Low oil prices provided good fiscal space to the government to mobilise resources to fight Covid-19. But crude oil prices have started rising now. Does this worry you?This may not be a matter of worry. The OMCs (oil marketing companies) are basically dependent on cracks -- the difference in the prices of crude and petroleum products in the international markets -- for their profitability, and not on the crude prices alone. I would say that high volatility in prices is in nobody’s interest. India always looks for a reasonable and responsible price regime.Both the Centre and states raised levies and mopped up almost all benefits of low international crude oil. But petrol and diesel prices were kept frozen. Why?The prices of petrol and diesel depend on the prices of these products in the international markets. Then there is the 15-day cycle to take the moving average of these products to estimate prices in the domestic market. Although crude prices came down, the product prices did not come down by the same percentage. The cracks actually became negative, hurting the books of Indian OMCs.The oil industry, too, was faced with an extraordinary situation. There were no takers for the crude being produced; the world literally ran out of storage space for the crude and petroleum products. The reduction in demand has led to a peculiar situation where product prices are less than the price of crude. These negative margins and low crude prices do not reflect the real economics of oil refining and the pricing of end products.The pandemic has had a huge impact on government revenue. Therefore, mopping up resources has become inevitable to deal with this unprecedented crisis.Global oil prices have softened. Is this the time to reduce India’s import dependence on politically volatile Middle East?To improve its resilience to disruptions in crude supplies due to geopolitical factors, India has significantly diversified its sources of crude oil over the years. Last year, we secured steady supplies of crude oil despite significant challenges to security in the Middle-East, particularly the attacks on Saudi oil facilities and the flare-up in US-Iran tensions. Over the last four years, we significantly diversified sources of crude oil to reduce excessive dependence on the Middle-East. As the US became an exporter of crude oil, we took proactive steps to import crude oil from the US since 2017. In a short span of two years, the US has now become one of the top 10 sources for crude oil imports. Earlier this year, in February, our companies added Russia as a source for crude oil by signing a term-contract starting this year. Our companies are also exploring sourcing of crude oil from other regions, including North and South America.It will be our constant endeavour to continue to diversify our oil and gas import sources from price-competitive countries or regions to reduce our dependence on the Middle-East. India imports its crude from about 25 countries, and no doubt the Middle East supplies the majority of that crude. During recent years, India has imported substantial amount of crude from the US, Nigeria, Mexico, Brazil etc.On May 17, the government announced a Public Sector Enterprise (PSE) policy. Do state-run oil and gas firms come under the list of strategic sectors?Oil and gas sector play a predominant role, as over one-third of the energy required is met by hydrocarbons. A considerable part of the infrastructure for the government’s push to a gas-based economy, including untouched areas, is also being steered by CPSEs (central public sector enterprises).It was announced that, in strategic sectors, at least one enterprise will remain in the public sector but the private sector will also be allowed. Does that mean there will be just one integrated oil PSU?The government believes in creating a level playing field in which both public as well as private players compete with each other and contribute to the overall growth of the sector. Other decisions, like how many PSUs in which sector are strategic, are subject to market conditions prevailing in each sector.This government recently completed the first year of its second term. What are the key achievements, and what is the road ahead?The government recognises that our supply security is a critical element in ensuring our energy security. To diversify the import of crude oil, IOCL (Indian Oil Corporation Ltd) has entered into long-term contract with the US and Russia to source crude oil. Further, taking advantage of the low crude oil price, India is filling the strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) to their full capacity. This will result in savings of approximately Rs 5,000 crore for the government towards filling the vacant cavern. This will boost India’s energy security.The government has taken a number of initiatives to encourage the use of alternative fuels and incentivise production of ethanol and biodiesel. In order to encourage the production of biodiesel from used cooking oil (UCO), the OMCs have floated expressions of interest (EOIs) for the supply of UCO biodiesel from 200 locations across the country. Till April 2020, 31 entrepreneurs submitted their EOIs for production of biodiesel from UCO from 50 plants with a capacity of 1,042 MT/day.Oil and gas will continue to remain vital for India’s energy security in the foreseeable future. A concerted effort is required by all stakeholders to ensure that India is appropriately positioned to take advantage of the existing opportunity. This may require end-to-end planning, synergies, and trade-offs across sectors.You also handle the steel ministry, which has been facing headwinds due to several reasons. What are your plans to boost this sector?The main thrust of the steel ministry has been to bring in cost competitiveness, and thereby improve steel usage in India. The possible disruption in iron ore availability was addressed by policy changes enabling public sector captive units to carry out the market sale of the mineral, apart from ensuring a smooth carry over of regulatory permissions to new leaseholders post the auction.There has been a thrust to facilitate local industries for which the ISPs (integrated steel plants) of SAIL have come out with a programme to incentivise local manufacturers. For the planned development of the sector and ancillaries, steel cluster projects under Purvodaya have been given impetus.By setting up a data system which gives better visibility regarding the imports in the sector, the SIMS (steel import management system) platform will prepare the ground for informed investment decisions by domestic industry, in turn contributing to local production and employment. The system has been made operational last November in association with the commerce department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-85mn-gas-cylinders-have-been-availed-under-gareeb-kalyan-yojana-dharmendra-pradhan/story-TQCthnpH3HQGiiUQwLtaaO.html
04-06-2020||India||Jets with enhanced protection to join PM’s fleet by September||Two specially modified Boeing-777 aircraft, capable of countering missile threats, will join Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Air India One fleet by September-end, two people familiar with the development said on Wednesday.The first head-of-state Boeing-777 aircraft will arrive in India from the United States by August-end followed by the second one a month later, they said on condition of anonymity.The planes will come equipped with self-protection suites (SPS) consisting of aircraft infrared countermeasures, advanced integrated defensive electronic warfare suite and counter-measures dispensing system to protect them from inbound missiles.The aircraft will match the US President’s Air Force One in security measures, the officials said. Air India had sent a pair of new Boeing 777-300ER aircraft to a Boeing facility in Dallas to be refurbished for VVIP travel, including installation of missile defence systems worth $190 million. Aircraft records from open source websites showed both jets were less than 3 years old and have been sparingly used.The new long-haul aircraft will be used exclusively by PM Modi, President Ram Nath Kovind and Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu.“The threat to VVIPs is always there. Whatever measures a nation needs to take to protect its top leadership should be taken,” said Air Marshal KK Nohwar (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies (CAPS).The three dignitaries fly Air India’s Boeing-747 planes that the state-run airline deploys on commercial flights. These are temporarily reconfigured for the dignitaries when they need to travel, with the call sign changing to Air India One.The Boeing-747 planes that are chartered from Air India for use by the three dignitaries are two decades old.The new planes have been configured to give PM Modi some generous office space, meeting rooms, a wide array of communication systems and a section for handling medical emergencies. The aircraft can fly between the US and India without having to stop for refuelling.The protection systems on the planes can jam enemy radar frequencies and divert heat-seeking missiles by disturbing their guidance systems.The US administration announced its decision to give India access to the SPS for the special VVIP aircraft in February 2019, stressing that the sale would improve India’s capability to deter regional threats. It said the SPS would facilitate “a more robust capability into areas of increased missile threats.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jets-with-enhanced-protection-to-join-pm-s-fleet-by-september/story-zSJNzcthbdNLFNeny4CKpI.html
04-06-2020||India||Man gunned down in park, chased inside an apartment complex and shot dead||A 40-year-old man was attacked by at least three unidentified gunmen while he was walking in a park in East Delhi’s Patparganj on Wednesday morning, chased to the nearby Aditi Apartments housing society, where he tried to hide behind parked cars, and shot dead, police said.The victim, Rahul Singh Nagar, contested the 2017 municipal elections in Delhi on a Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) ticket from the Vinod Nagar constituency. With assets worth over Rs 9.51 crore, Nagar was among the richest candidates who had contested the elections. His immovable assets include 13 residential buildings, four commercial shops and three cars, including an Audi, his brother, Satya, said. The identity of the killers or the motive behind the crime were not clear, police said. They suspect that Nagar may have been killed over a property dispute. A police officer said they used to receive complaints against Nagar regarding “property grabbing”.Jasmeet Singh, deputy commissioner of police (east), said Nagar was shot four times, and died before he could be taken to hospital. The police are investigating whether more rounds that may have missed Nagar were fired either at the park or in the apartment complex.A case of murder has been registered at Mandawali police station.Nagar, a property dealer by profession, lived with his wife and daughter in West Vinod Nagar, which is about a kilometre from the scene of the crime. His four brothers and parents live in another house in the same locality.According to the DCP, Nagar had some criminal cases against him. “Those cases were mostly pertaining to quarrels,” he said. Nagar’s brother, Satya, however, said that those were all old cases, which were eventually closed.Every morning, Nagar would walk with a friend – Satish Master,40, a government school teacher in Daryaganj -- in the park outside Aditi Apartments, which is the first housing society of the line of apartment blocks on Narwana Road, a stone’s throw from the main Mother Dairy factory in Patparganj.“He would always be accompanied by his friend,” said Satya. “The friend told us that he had stopped to urinate while Nagar kept walking. Suddenly he heard multiple gunshots,” he added. “There were 40-50 people walking in the park when the firing started. Though none of us exactly saw where the firing was taking place, all of us started running and we all were scared for our lives. I did not see the attackers. All I saw was Nagar ji running towards the apartments,” said Satish, adding that he informed Nagar’s family after seeing him dead.The DCP said the attack took place at around 7.15am, just as Nagar was walking out of the park. He added that the initial probe suggested that there were three to four assailants, but Satya said the friend told him at least two more assailants were waiting outside the park.Once the shots were fired, Nagar ran into the apartment complex to hide. An investigator who asked not to be named said he managed ran through a corridor of the complex, with the attackers continuing to pursue him. “He went to the parking lot inside and hid behind some cars. But he had already been shot four times by then. He had bullet wounds in his chest, head and hand,” the investigator said. As residents, who heard the gunshots, began coming out of their homes, the assailants escaped, police said. “No resident from our society was present in the compound where the man was shot. Our security guard was at the gate. But he was unarmed and could not do anything against armed attackers,” said Prakash Chander, secretary of Aditi Corporation Group Housing Society Limited.Nagar was taken to Max Hospital in Patparganj but was declared “brought dead”. Police said they are scanning CCTV footage for clues, but there was no breakthrough till Wednesday evening.Nagar’s family members said there was a near-fatal firing attack on him in November 2019 as well but the police did not take any action. Joint commissioner of police (eastern range) Alok Kumar, however, said that four persons were arrested in that case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-gunned-down-in-the-park-is-chased-inside-an-apartment-complex/story-jkgNROxodCGgHnH4Ke5yZN.html
04-06-2020||India||Tahir ‘led, instigated’ IB official’s murder: Police||Delhi Police on Wednesday filed a second charge sheet against suspended Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain for incidents linked to the February riots in north-east Delhi, alleging that he “led and instigated” the murder of IB official Ankit Sharma as part of a “deep-rooted conspiracy”.This is the second charge sheet filed against Hussain in two days. He was charged by the police on Tuesday for allegedly playing a pivotal role in the riots in which 53 people were killed and over 400 injured.The police on Wednesday also filed a charge sheet against the principal of Shiv Vihar Rajdhani Public school for rioting outside the premises of the school during the communal rioting that started as clashes between protestors for and against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and raged for four daysSharma’s body, which had 51 sharp and blunt injuries, was dumped in a drain, said the police in its charge sheet, which also claims to have found an eyewitness who recorded a mob dumping the body.Narrating the alleged sequence of events that led to Sharma’s death, the police said: “At around 5pm on February 25, the IB official had moved ahead from the crowd of Hindu people standing a few distance away from Hussain’s house to pacify the people of both sides, when around 20-25 rioters on Hussain’s instructions caught him and dragged him to Chand Bagh bridge, where they beat him to death.” The police said one of the suspects, identified as Salman, charged in the case along with Hussain and nine others, was arrested after the police intercepted phone calls in which he spoke to relatives about the murder of a person whose body had been dumped in a drain. Hussain’s lawyer, Javed Ali, denied the police allegations and called them a political conspiracy against his client.“There is no direct evidence and allegations which shows that my client was involved in the crime (Ankit Sharma’s murder). In the FIR, police have stated that my client was rescued on February 24 from his house. Hence, there is no question of talking, interacting or being involved in the incident which took place on February 25,” Ali said. In the charge sheet related to the rioting outside Shiv Vihar Rajdhani School, police charged 18 people, including school principal Faisal Farooque, who has been charged under sections dealing with rioting and criminal conspiracy, among others.Using call data records as evidence against Farooque, police claimed that Farooque was in touch with members of the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC), women’s group Pinjra Tod, Popular Front of India (PFI) and the Tablighi Jamaat. Police have r arrested members of the JCC, Pinjra Tod and PFI for their alleged involvement in different incidents of violence during the riots. The groups have called the arrest of their members a “witch hunt”.Police accused Farooque of “hatching a conspiracy to aggravate the riots” around the school. Police said the allegation was based on a statement by school security guards.“His call detail analysis and links with prominent members of Popular Front of India, Pinjra Tod group, Jamia Coordination Committee, Hazrat Nizamuddin Markaz and some other fundamental Muslim clerics, including Deoband also show the depth of the conspiracy. In fact, it has been found that Faisal Farooque visited Deoband just one day before the riots started (February 23),” the police said in the charge sheet. Markaz is the headquarters of the Talblighi Jamaat, an Islamic missionary group. Police also attached photographs of a large catapult they found on the terrace of the school. Police said the catapult was used to launch throw bricks, acids, stones and molotov cocktails and added that the rioters had camped inside and fired bullets from the terrace of Shiv Vihar Rajdhani School. The police also attached photographs of a rope that was tied to the terrace of the school to the adjacent DRP Convent Public School, which was used by rioters to climb down to the convent school and set it on fire. Farooque’s counsel Shams Khwaja denied the police allegations and said both schools had filed police complaints of arson. “My client promptly reported the arson to police control room repeatedly as per police record and also to the fire brigade. No one came to help. His complaint precedes the neighbouring school’s and yet his FIR was registered only after the neighbouring school’s complaint.”Khwaja added that the FIR filed by the DRP convent school did not name Farooque as a rioter. “My client wasn’t named in the FIR by the neighbouring school at all. He was arrested on the basis of sham witnesses set up by the police. Talking to ulemas of Deoband is no crime. That institution has a history of pioneering the freedom movement for our Independence. How could talking to them be construed as a problem?”He also said joining anti-CAA protests or being a member of the Pinjra Tod or JCC were not crimes. “But even so my client was not involved in these protests. Unless they can show conversations with these people where my client is instigating or planning violence, he cannot be implicated.”On reports that Farooque was in touch with senior members of the Tablighi Jamaat, a school administrator who asked not to be named, said, “Tablighi Jamaat wasn’t involved in riots and their name only came up during the Covid-19 incident. How is the police linking these two? We didn’t have the time to participate in anti-CAA protests and sit on the roads because January and February is the time we usually prepare for the upcoming board exams.”Markaz, the headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat in Nizamuddin Basti, was sealed after the emergence of a large cluster of Covid-19 cases on its premises following a large religious congregation in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tahir-led-instigated-ib-official-s-murder-police/story-1FgyuGjdHQo6OH0OkSXLZM.html
04-06-2020||India||AAP’s Raghav Chadha accuses RML of inaccurate testing, hospital rejects claim||Raghav Chadha, the Aam Aadmi Party’s national spokesperson, on Wednesday accused authorities of Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital of inaccurate Covid-19 testing, and of violating orders that require hospitals submit test results to the government within 48 hours of their being conducted. Chadha, also AAP MLA from Rajendra Nagar, asked the Delhi government to act against the Centre-run hospital.“The Delhi government collected 30 such samples from RML Hospitals that concern individuals who tested Covid-19 positive. The government re-assessed the samples, collected less than 24 hours ago and found that 12 of those samples tested negative and results pertaining to two of them were inconclusive. This suggests a variation of around 45%. It is absolutely irresponsible, and the amount of stress that the inaccurate results could have caused to the individuals and their families is unimaginable,” Chadha said.He added, “Government directives require hospitals to give best efforts in submitting test results within 24 hours, and provides a maximum window of 48 hours. The court also upheld such directives. RML Hospital has violated that time and again. Around 281 patents got their results after three days, 210 people got their result were after four days, 50 people got their result after seven days, four people got their result after nine days, and some reports were submitted after 31 days. I urge the Delhi government to initiate action against RML Hospital.”Authorities from RML hospital disputed the allegations. “The 30 samples that were tested by the Delhi government were collected after seven to 14 days of the test being done at RML hospital. In these many days, the virus can easily clear out of the system of those infected. There is no compromise in the quality of testing here at RML. In fact, we also keep verifying our samples with AIIMS [All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences] and NCDC [National Centre for Disease Control], and have the same level of accuracy. The hospital has already submitted a written reply to the Delhi government, as well as the Union health ministry,” said Smriti Tiwari, the hospital’s spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-raghav-chadha-accuses-rml-of-inaccurate-testing-hospital-rejects-claim/story-lZWRCjF7sftdWDyca20cUL.html
04-06-2020||India||Congress seeks Piyush Goyal resignation over Shramik specials||The Congress on Wednesday demanded resignation or removal of railway minister Piyush Goyal and said the Centre has been “less than fair” with the details about the special trains for migrant workers and has created confusion.Senior spokesperson for the party, Abhishek Singhvi, said the Centre has repeatedly maintained that 85% of the cost of rail tickets for migrants is paid by the Indian railway. Solicitor General repeatedly said in the Supreme Court that all of the cost of the railways and travel for the migrants is to be borne by states sending and receiving them.Singhvi claimed that in most cases “Rs 30 and Rs 20 charge for food and water was in fact levied”. “Now, far from giving things free, which has the impression given to everybody, these are charges charged by the railways,” he said. Singhvi underlined the apex court had to give a direction that passengers must be provided with food and water.He said there is still a lot of confusion and “people don’t know, which train is going where, whether their name is on the list, whether they will get space”. Singhvi quoted media reports and said about 40% of trains ran late and the average delay was eight hours. “There were 78 trains which were delayed by more than one day and of course 43 trains which were delayed by more than 30-35 hours...”However, Goyal in an interview to HT on June 1 said the allegations on widespread delays and diversions were “completely baseless and wrong”. “Almost all trains up to May 19 were before time... only 71 out of 4,040, which is 1.75% trains, were diverted.” he said.In a statement, Bharatiya Janata Party spokesman Syed Shahnawaz Hussain separately said none of the deaths on the special trains was caused by hunger or starvation as per the post-mortem reports. “Natural deaths have occurred on the trains in the past too but the manner in which unfortunate deaths of Shramiks [workers] have been politicized is unprecedented without waiting to know about the exact cause of deaths.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-seeks-goyal-resignation-over-shramik-specials/story-JtXmAtNsXNp8IKmSpKblJO.html

Kumar got himself tested for Covid-19 after developing mild fever and was found to be infected, said one of the persons.“He tested positive on Tuesday. His condition is stable and he will stay at home till he tests negative,” said another person.A defence ministry spokesperson refused to comment on the matter.Necessary contact tracing is being carried out in the case of the defence secretary to identify people he may have recently come in contact with and who may now be in the high-risk category, officials said.Kumar is the first top government official to test positive for the disease.The chief of defence staff and the three service chiefs may not have had direct contact with Kumar during the last four days, the officials added. Defence minister Rajnath Singh did not attend office on Wednesday but it was not immediately known why. The minister is discharging his duties as usual, the officials said.The first-floor section of the South Block in which the defence secretary has his office is being sanitised. All protocols are being followed. Nothing is being taken lightly, the officials said. Several top officials have their offices on the first floor including the defence minister, the army chief, the navy chief and a string of bureaucrats.Also, more Covid-19 cases have surfaced in Shastri Bhawan as Delhi has witnessed a steady increase in infections. According to officials, a joint secretary in the law ministry and the driver of a joint secretary in the culture ministry have also tested positive for the highly contagious disease.Some days ago, a section officer in the coal ministry died due to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-secy-tests-positive-quarantined/story-nshas2mlCukSYIWkL1qmdP.html
04-06-2020||India||Painkiller Ibuprofen tested as potential treatment for Covid-19 in London||Scientists in London are running tests to find out whether common painkiller and anti-inflammatory medicine Ibuprofen can help to treat Covid-19 positive patients and steer them away from fatal respiratory failure and the need for ventilators, news agency Bloomberg reported.A team of researchers from London’s Guy’s Hospital, St Thomas’ Hospital and King’s College are running a trial to see whether the painkiller and anti-inflammatory medicine Ibuprofen can be used to treat coronavirus patients. With around 180 countries across the world grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic amid escalating deaths, scientists and researchers are hoping that the low-cost treatment will reduce the burden on hospitals and medical facilities by keeping patients off ventilators.The study uses a type of Ibuprofen called Flarin that’s available in the United Kingdom and has a separate composition than the standard version to protect the stomach. The study is being run by Guy’s and St. Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, King’s College London and SEEK, a proprietary drug-research firm.ALSO READ | Remdesivir most beneficial for severely ill Covid-19 patients, say researchersIf the clinical trial is successful, it would mark a turnaround in attitudes toward the drug during the Covid-19 pandemic. The trial, called Liberate, was launched after studies conducted on animals suggested that the medication could treat acute respiratory distress syndrome — one of the complications associated with the Covid-19 disease.The trial will be randomized, with half the patients receiving standard care alone and the other half receiving the drug additionally. The first half who will receive standard care, will continuously be given oxygen as well.“As a new illness, there are limited treatment options for patients with Covid-19,” said Richard Beale, a professor of intensive care medicine at the NHS trust. “The clinical trial will assess whether this unique formulation of an established drug benefits patients.”ALSO READ | WHO says anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine’s coronavirus trials to resumeProfessor Mitul Mehta, a member of the research team, stressed that the trial was for hospitalised patients and not for mild cases. Participants were drawn from among those hospitalised, but not requiring intensive care, according to the news agency.French Health Minister Olivier Veran had said in March that patients with Covid-19 should avoid anti-inflammatory drugs like Ibuprofen because it might aggravate their infections. Europe’s top medicines regulator said shortly afterward that there’s no solid evidence that Ibuprofen makes the virus worse.At the onset of the pandemic in the United Kingdom, health experts had raised concerns over whether the anti-inflammatory drug should be used by people showing mild coronavirus symptoms. Following this, the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) in March withdrew the advisory they had issued on their website for the use of Ibuprofen by people suffering from mild cases of Covid-19.The United Kingdom is one of the worst-hit countries in the world with a very high concentration of coronavirus positive patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/painkiller-ibuprofen-tested-as-potential-treatment-for-covid-19-in-london/story-eXEJHgZfey8q3OqVx56zpO.html
04-06-2020||India||Body to help central paramilitary forces given FCRA licence||The Centre’s “Bharat ke Veer” platform that collect funds for families of central paramilitary personnel who are killed in action has been given permission by the ministry of home affairs to receive funding from abroad under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), people familiar with the development said.The trust, launched by senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and then home minister  Rajnath Singh and actor Akshay Kumar on April 9, 2017, has received Rs 332 crore in donations till date, largely contributions by individuals within India.A large number of non-resident Indians (NRIs), too, had expressed their desire to contribute to the platform to help the families of troopers killed in the line of duty. After the Pulwama suicide bombing on February 14, 2019, in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed, many NRIs and foreign nationals approached Indian authorities through social media platform and embassies abroad, enquiring about ways to donate.In the absence of a FCRA licence, they had to send their contributions to the embassies or local consulates. In one such example, 26-year-old Viveik Patel of Virginia in the US managed to collect Rs 7.5 crore within four days of the Pulwama attack through a fundraiser for the families of the slain troopers. This money was sent to Bharat Ke Veer through a cheque collected by the Indian consulate in New York as direct transfers from abroad were not allowed.Bharat ke Veer’s nodal officer, CRPF deputy inspector general (DIG) Vijay Kumar, said: “A large number of NRIs and nationals from other countries understand the plight of families of martyrs who die fighting terrorists or extremists in Jammu and Kashmir, Naxal-affected states or northeast and used to contact us asking how they can contribute. When we didn’t have FCRA licence, we used to tell NRIs to send the money through the embassy or an organization (registered to send money to India). People can now send money from anywhere in the world directly”.The government last week also authorized the use of the Bharat Ke Veer corpus to help the families of central paramilitary forces personnel who succumb to Covid-19 while on duty.In the Bharat Ke Veer initiative, which was a brainchild of Akshay Kumar, families of individuals will receive up to Rs 15 lakh, which can be sent by people directly into their accounts. Once the amount touches Rs 15 lakh, the details of the slain trooper are taken off the platform. This financial assistance is separate from government benefits including provident fund, insurance and one-time compensation.As of now, Bharat Ke Veer has been used to provide finance assistance to families of 304 central paramilitary force personnel (maximum of 201 from the CRPF) out of whom 289 have already got the full Rs 15 lakh.

The General Officer Commanding of the Leh-based HQs 14 Corps, Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, is expected to meet his Chinese counterpart on Saturday, exactly a month after tensions between India and China started building up along the disputed border.This is perhaps the first time that lieutenant generals are meeting in a sensitive sector to defuse border tensions --- the highest level of talks between India and China at the tactical level have usually involved major generals.Narasimhan said the modalities of resolving the border situation, with focus on concerns brought to the table by both sides, could figure on the agenda of the talks.Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday announced that a meeting between senior Indian and Chinese military officials would take place on June 6 to discuss the border situation.Northern Army commander Lieutenant General YK Joshi was in Leh on Wednesday for a security review of the sensitive sector where Indian and Chinese soldiers are eyeball-to-eyeball at four locations along the LAC.Several rounds of talks between local military commanders, including three rounds of discussions between major generals, have failed to break the stalemate that began with a violent confrontation between rival patrols near Pangong Tso four weeks ago.Around 250 soldiers from the two countries clashed near Pangong Tso on the night of May 5-6 with the scuffle leaving scores of troops injured. While an immediate flare-up was avoided as both armies stuck to protocols to resolve the situation, tensions swiftly spread to other pockets along the LAC.China has marshalled close to 5,000 soldiers and deployed tanks and artillery guns on its side of the disputed border in the Ladakh sector where India has also sent military reinforcements and matched the neighbour’s military moves, as reported by Hindustan Times on May 26.China’s state-run media has described the latest tensions as the worst since the 2017 Doklam standoff that lasted 73 days.HT was the first to report on May 10 about tensions flaring up between India and China in north Sikkim where 150 soldiers were involved in a tense standoff a day earlier. Four Indian and seven Chinese soldiers were injured at Naku La during the confrontation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-face-off-june-6-meet-key-to-defusing-tensions/story-zQ0Rau8nfOhJSiYl1hPFUN.html

The vehicles will be used in locust control apart from other calamity relief activities, the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) said in a statement.The district collectors have also been allocated funds from SDRF for the purchase of tractor mounted sprayers and other vehicles, chemical and for other arrangements for locust control. All the collectors have been allocated Rs 1.47 crore. Along with this, the recruitment process of 290 assistant agriculture officers and one thousand 900 agricultural supervisors in the Department of Agriculture will also be completed soon, the statement said.In a review meeting at Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot’s residence to take stock of the locust invasion, agriculture minister Lalchand Kataria and revenue minister Harish Chaudhary said that there is no dearth of resources to control locusts.They said a district-wise strategy has to be drawn up to fight the locusts.Congress deputy chief whip Mahendra Chaudhary said that in view of the frequent attacks of locusts, it has become necessary to strengthen the locust warning organization.Principal secretary of agriculture department, Naresh Pal Gangwar said that till now locust control has been carried out across 95,000 hectare area.Over the past few weeks locust swarms have invaded Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and parts of Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-to-buy-100-fire-engines-to-fight-locust-invasion/story-kGwe4wPSsZnrNj1iO4iOXI.html

She led a team of researchers who tracked more than 15 million cellphones for a year to map the way human mobility contributed to the spread of the disease.This year, as Covid-19 began to spread out from its epicentre in China to become a global pandemic, Buckee put her expertise to use to form the Covid-19 Mobility Data Network, connecting epidemiologists from around the world to analyze massive tranches of mobile phone location data to track the efficacy of social-distancing measures, and the spread of the disease. In this email/phone interview with Rudraneil Sengupta, Buckee talks about the intersection of big data and disease control, contract tracing apps and privacy issues, and why predicting the spread of Covid-19 has been so fraught with uncertainties.Has there ever been more interest on aggregating data on a large scale to fight a disease than what we are seeing now?For about 10 years now I’ve been working with mobile phone data in the context of epidemic modelling and trying to understand the spatial spread of human pathogens via human mobility. It’s been slow progress because of the regulatory frameworks and the privacy frameworks—there is reticence to share data and scepticism about its utility. But in the last four months, since the beginning of the pandemic, it’s become abundantly clear to the world that actually this data is incredibly useful. So we have seen an outpouring of data from different kinds of providers—mobile phone companies, but also Facebook and Google and others. It has led to a proliferation of work that builds on a lot of what we have been doing for a long time, but it’s happening in a somewhat unregulated way. It’s exciting what’s happening, but also there is some cause for concern that we are putting the cart before the horse. We really need to take care in the interpretation of these data sets and ensure that they are actually answering policy-relevant questions. We also need to make sure that we are aggregating this data in a way that protects privacy.What are the correct privacy protocols?I should distinguish between contact tracing apps and what we are doing. What we are doing is always aggregated in time and space so you can never identify an individual in that data. There are different ways of doing that; you can use differential privacy, which basically means adding a layer of noise, so it jitters the positions—the signal is fine, but the details can’t be figured out. Also you never go down to the spatial resolution where there are too few devices in a particular area. A lot of times we aggregate in a way that’s memory-less—you can’t tell that this individual went here and then there—you can only tell that X number of people moved between city A and city B on this day.For the contact tracing apps, obviously when you consent to take part in it, you are saying you are giving up your data to be analysed.You could argue that boots-on-the-ground contact tracing is also invasive and also involves collection of individual data, but the problem with digital contact tracing is that it’s more opaque. Who has access to the data? Who controls the data? How is it being used? Is there a deadline for destroying it? Contact tracing apps open up a whole new realm of questions as to what’s appropriate and in what context and it will be effective. It remains to be seen what the efficacy of these apps will be in places where the health system is not very strong. I am not sure they will be effective and I think the risk of undermining public trust further and the potential for misuse of the data and spurious false positives, poor sensitivity and specificity, are all problematic.Like the app we are using here, Aarogya Setu, where you self-declare symptoms...the feeling is, a lot of people will not complyYou need high compliance for these apps to work, and if the incentives are not there and the trust is not there then you won’t get sufficient compliance. If you try to make it mandatory then you will certainly not get honest reporting of symptoms. The second thing is that Bluetooth devices are not perfect, neither have they been tested yet. We don’t know the extent of false positives—the app may think you are close to somebody, but actually you are in an office building and behind a wall. These apps are going to have very variable false positivity rates, a lot of spurious pings, as well as false negative rates because not everybody is compliant, not everyone has a smartphone, and so on. Also can the health system even respond in a meaningful way to whatever data is coming from these apps?What about people who cannot afford social distancing?Strict quarantine and social distancing may not be appropriate everywhere. There’s also this issue of how to even think about isolating people in the context of an urban slum—it’s a very difficult problem. There are a set of approaches that’s been tried in refugee camps and low income settings that are crowded and they involve simple things like separating out infected people from susceptible people, masks, and this concept of immune shielding—though we still don’t know the extent of immunity or protection.What’s that?Usually, if you have some vulnerable groups, our tendency is to try and put them all in one place and then protect that place. But there is this idea that once you have people who have already had Covid-19, you should actually mix them in with the vulnerable population, and they will act as immune shields. For example, people who are already immune are given the task of taking care of elderly people.What are the biggest challenges you face when you try to model the way the disease may behave?The biggest one is not knowing how many cases there are. That affects all models. If you are not testing enough, if you have mild or no symptoms….then we don’t know where we are with the epidemic and we don’t know where the cases are. Without that underlying data, all the models become uncertain, we just don’t know where we are with the epidemic curve.For longer-term forecasts, we don’t know about immunity, so we don’t know how protective it is or how long that lasts, and that has an impact on whether we can expect seasonal outbreaks in the future.There’s a big question on how infectious children are and how much they are contributing. There is some data that suggests that children may be less infectious, but it’s still a big uncertaintyAll of these epidemiological models also make some assumption on the contact rate—how many people do you come in close contact with every day? That’s a very hard thing to measure or make sense of given the various interventions. We don’t really know what impact it has had on the number of exposures people have every day, so that’s a major source of uncertainty.Where do we stand right now?The answer depends on whether we will see seasonal effects. For most countries, we are well into the first wave of the epidemic, and the lockdowns that have happened has in many places flattened the curve by reducing the contact rate. The big question is the extent to which we will have massive resurgence as we reopen, and when the highest risk for that resurgence is.

04-06-2020||India||Lockdown avoided Covid fatalities, but may cost lives indirectly: Study||The lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India will have a lingering impact on lives, not just livelihoods, a working paper by two prominent economists has said, identifying violence, starvation, indebtedness and extreme stress as consequences of the shutdown that was in place in the last two months.The working paper titled Interim Report on India’s Lockdown, submitted to American non-profit research agency National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), analyses the philosophy of the lockdown in the Indian context, its impact, as well as the administration’s response to mitigate these consequencesLockdowns, the authors contend, have been propelled across the world by the “enormous visibility” of Covid-19 fatalities. While in advanced economies, the cost of reducing these visible deaths is a “dramatic reduction” in overall economic activity, in India, “a developing country with great sectoral and occupational vulnerabilities, this dramatic reduction is more than economic: it means lives lost,” says the paper by professors Debraj Ray and S Subramanian.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe lives lost as a consequence of the lockdown will be invisible, the paper says, adding: “It is this conjunction of visibility and invisibility that drives the Indian response. The lockdown meets all international standards so far; the relief package none.” Ray teaches at the New York University while Subramanian, a retired professor from Madras Institute of Development Studies, is a former member of the advisory board of the World Bank’s Commission on Global Poverty.India’s nationwide lockdown was enforced first on March 25, before it was diluted in phases over the next three months. The period was marked by a widespread return of low-paid urban migrants, who undertook gruelling journeys by foot, on illegally running trucks and crammed into special trains to return to their villages and home towns after losing their jobs. Since June 1, India has been in the first phase of Unlock. Union government officials have said the lockdown was successful in slowing the spread of the disease and buying time to improve infrastructure. The government last month announced a ₹20 lakh crore relief package but analysts have said that the actual government spending in the package could be much lower. “Lives lost through violence, starvation, indebtedness and extreme stress, are invisible, in the sense that they will diffuse through category and time. Someone will die of suicide. A woman will be killed in an episode of domestic violence. The police might beat a protestor to death. The deaths will occur not just now, but months and years from now, as mounting starvation and indebtedness and chronic illnesses take their collective toll,” the authors write. The authors cite three structural features that makes the Indian population vulnerable to a lockdown in the absence of welfare relief measures. “The first has to do with the ubiquity of casual labour, accounting for well over 20% of all Indian households — such individuals are particularly vulnerable. “The second is the preponderance of informal production — well over half of India’s GDP is produced in the informal sector — and these are activities which cannot be easily taken online... “Third, median household savings are low, and inadequate to take an estimated 38% of all households through even a 21-day lockdown (we are currently on our way to two months) if all their employment dries up,” the authors contend.As of Wednesday, India has 216,677 cases. On Tuesday, Indian Council of Medical Research scientist Nivedita Gupta said the country was still “very far away from the peak”. Public health experts have said that this could inevitably force federal and local authorities to bring back lockdown curbs, a measure that one of the authors of the NBER working paper described “as an even worse idea” compared to the first lockdown. “A severely comprehensive and draconian lockdown, and furthermore one without compensating welfare measures in place, was never a good idea, and is an even worse idea now in the light of the costs of the lockdown till date—costs in terms of loss of lives, loss of employment, loss of incomes, and the neglect of other (non-Covid-related) morbidities,” Subramanian said in an interview over email to HT.Subramanian added that the government will need to take a slew of measures if it is to consider such an intervention again. He divided these steps into five specific areas: (1) Adopt genuine fiscal policy measures such as “spend substantially more on compensating relief measures, raise more resources through rudimentary taxation of the wealth of the super-rich, and not rely predominantly on supply-side strategies such as liquidity expansion involving the channelling of credit through banks”;(2) Address “supply-side constraints in the form of physical bottlenecks—restrictions on mobility, closed mandis, etc -- still waiting to be eased”;(3) Deal “with the states of the Union in a genuine spirit of partnership and assistance, beginning at least with settling their dues in terms of their share of revenue from GST”; (4) See “the wisdom of engaging a panel of public health specialists, epidemiologists, social workers, economists, other social scientists, trades unions, and opposition politicians who all have a stake in this country,” and;(5) Address “both the epidemiological and social security problems that are upon us in a spirit of openness, mutuality, and special respect for those rendered most vulnerable by both the material and social burdens imposed by the pandemic.” The panel that Subramanian suggested in the fourth point should be in a position to advise on the merits of selective lockdown that “discriminates both geographically and with respect to specific industries and economic activity.” “The panel can also assist with identifying and overseeing the implementation of key relief measures—both cash and in-kind—which have been suggested by several commentators,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-avoided-covid-fatalities-but-may-cost-lives-indirectly-study/story-xNbF4l9YwQp0ituXWiUEiI.html
04-06-2020||India||Study dismissing benefits of malaria drugs under lens||The Lancet has alerted its readers that it is reviewing the data and methods of a study published in it that claimed the malaria drugs, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, provided coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients no benefits while raising the risk of abnormal heart rhythms and death after scientists, clinicians and governments questioned its validity.The review has put the spotlight on Surgisphere, a Chicago-based company that owns the questionable database that has been used in studies published in The Lancet and also New England Journal of Medicine, the world’s two most highly-cited medical journals.An investigation by the The Guardian revealed that Surgisphere has a sci-fi author and an adult-content model among its handful of employees; that employees have little or no data or scientific training; and that it has provided data for multiple studies on Covid-19 co-authored by its chief executive Sapan Desai. The investigation further shows that the company has consistently failed to adequately explain its data source or methodology. Desai has been named in three medical malpractice suits, unrelated to the Surgisphere database, according to The Guardian.The study, published by The Lancet on May 22, drew flak for using questionable data and flawed methodology and refusing to share data sources, including the names of participating hospitals or countries. Last week, around 120 leading scientists and clinicians wrote an open letter to the study’s authors and The Lancet asking for details about the provenance of the data and called for the study to be independently validated by the World Health Organization (WHO) or another independent body.“Important scientific questions have been raised about data reported in the paper by Mandeep Mehra et al— hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of Covid-19: a multinational registry analysis—published in The Lancet on May 22, 2020. Although an independent audit of the provenance and validity of the data has been commissioned by the authors not affiliated with Surgisphere and is ongoing, with results expected very shortly, we are issuing an Expression of Concern to alert readers to the fact that serious scientific questions have been brought to our attention. We will update this notice as soon as we have further information,” said a statement issued by The Lancet on Wednesday.The Lancet’s editor-in-chief Richard Horton tweeted The Guardian link, calling it “an important investigation---Governments and WHO changed Covid-19 policy based on suspect data from US company,” which led to angry responses questioning the quality of peer review in medical journals.“The key concerns for us were that the data was questionable and there were clear differences in the hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treated group that made analysis unreliable and any results misleading. If not for the name of the journal, the paper would have not have been taken as seriously. I do not think there is any lasting harm. What you see is the scientific process of self-correction. There was a questionable paper, questions were asked, The Lancet has put out an expression of concern regarding the paper. Let us wait and see. The truth will come out by this process,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi.Dr Agrawal is among India’s top scientists who have also written to WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan questioning the health agency’s decision to suspend hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine part of the multi-country Solidarity Trial following The Lancet study. The letter said the WHO decision to pause trial is “knee-jerk” because the database is flawed and the malaria drugs were given to the sickest patients.“We are not saying that hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine are totally safe or that there is any certain benefit. Nobody knows. All we are saying is that the risks and benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine are open questions that need to be answered. Being inexpensive and potentially available worldwide, trials must continue. Until good evidence comes, national regulatory bodies should take decisions based on their context,” said Dr Agrawal.In a statement on Friday, The Lancet study’s author Dr Mandeep R. Mehra, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Center for Advanced Heart Disease in Boston, said this group’s study “leveraged the data available through Surgisphere to provide observational guidance to inform the care of hospitalized Covid-19 patients” because the results of randomized clinical trials would not be available for some time”. He said the study’s authors have asked for an independent academic audit.Scientists who wrote and signed the letter criticising the study included clinicians, researchers, statisticians and ethicists from universities and medical institutes, including Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, University of Pennsylvania, Vanderbilt University and Duke University.France’s health minister Olivier Veran wrote to the scientific journal with questions about the underlying data after it was criticized for the data used in the study, French government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye said after a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.In the absence of a treatment or vaccine, two of the major drugs being repurposed to treat Covid-19 are the tried and tested malarial drugs hydoxychloroquine and chloroquine, which US President Donald Trump told White House reporters he has been having prevent infection.India is the world’s biggest producer of hydroxychloroquine, which is approved for use as a prophylaxis and given to asymptomatic health workers and contacts of Covid-19 patients since March 23. This was expanded to include frontline workers from May 22 on the basis of a study by Indian Council Of Medical Research that found that having four or more doses of hydroxychloroquine lowers the odds of getting infected with Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease. The study, published in Indian Journal of Respiratory Research earlier this week, said the malaria drug lowered the risk of infection by 80% if taken as recommended. The National Task Force for coronavirus in India recommended a once a week maintenance dose for seven weeks -- 400 mg once every week, following the loading dose of 400 mg.A cheap, safe and widely available drug that has been used to treat malaria for at least a century, hydroxychloroquine is also approved to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/study-dismissing-benefits-of-malaria-drugs-under-lens/story-rgiW21UU3r1QstQI1eVdgK.html

The card will facilitate a strategic framework to provide the returning citizens with suitable employment opportunities through discussions with key stakeholders including State Governments, Industry Associations and Employers,” the statement added.Union skill development minister Mahendra Nath Pandey said, “We are pleased to partner with the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Ministry of External Affairs to conduct this skill mapping of overseas returning citizens under the Vande Bharat Mission.The data collected through SWADES Skill Card will help the citizens with job prospects and bridge the demand-supply gap.”Millions of Indians stranded abroad have registered at the various Indian missions to return to India and so far, more than 57,000 people have already come back. Millions of migrant workers from large Indian cities have also returned home over the past few months (and especially in May). Former rural development secretary Jugal Kishore Mohapatra said, “such a data base will improve efficiency in the indian markets and help local companies who will now need more skilled people to find it easily through the government database.

04-06-2020||India||Modi government doubles down on farm liberalisation||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday announced far-reaching steps to unshackle the country’s farm sector, approving amendments to the six-decade-old Essential Commodities Act and pushing two ordinances, one aimed at freeing up farm trade from all restrictions and the other guaranteeing a legal framework for pre-agreed prices to farmers. All these steps, which bring the full force of liberalisation to the farm economy, were announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on May 15 in the second of her series of briefings last month on proposed reforms.On May 12, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, announced a package worth Rs 20 lakh crore to spur growth. The economy grew 3.1% in the March quarter, an 11-year-low, pulling down full-year economic growth to 4.2% in the year ended March 31, compared with 6.1% in the previous fiscal. The Essential Commodities Act 1955 is mainly used to curb inflation by empowering the Union and state governments to dictate quantities traders can store and also restrict the movement of any commodity deemed “essential”. Under the law, the government generally imposes stock limits to discourage hoarding of items such as pulses and vegetables. The law was handy during the 1980s when India was still a net importer of food items. The country’s increasing food surpluses have made the law archaic. The country had 100 million tonne of foodgrains in warehouses across India at the end of April. The country’s annual requirement under various welfare programmes is 60 million tonne. India is likely to produce a record 292 million tonne of food grains in 2019-20. According to official data released on June 2, total vegetable output during 2019-20 stood at 320 million tonne, 3.13% higher than the previous year.“Farmers have been unable to get better prices due to lack of investment in cold storage, processing and export as the entrepreneurial spirit gets dampened due to hanging sword of Essential Commodities Act,” the government said in a statement on Wednesday. Since large stocks held by traders can be outlawed under the ECA 1955 anytime, they tend to buy far less than their usual capacity and farmers often suffer huge losses during surplus harvests of perishables. Such laws have kept poor farmers poor by restricting opportunities to export when global crop prices go up, according to a landmark 2018 study by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a grouping of 36 countries, and the New Delhi-based research firm ICRIER.“These are major reforms that will ultimately liberalise the farm sector and free it from dated rules. We need to corporatize agriculture and these moves are aimed at getting more investments and reducing dependencies on the government,” said NR Bhanumurthy, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, New Delhi. The agriculture sector, which supports half of all Indians, hasn’t been generating enough revenues to keep farmers profitable for nearly two decades due to trade restrictions and an obsession with keeping food prices low to avoid inflation, according to the OECD-ICRIER study mentioned above. The ECA 1955 allowed for trade restrictions specifically designed to keep domestic food inflation low, including frequent ban on exports, a source of high farm income. The ECA will be amended and cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes will be removed from the list of essential commodities. “This will remove fears of private investors of excessive regulatory interference,” an official statement said. Restrictions can only be clamped during “war, famine, extraordinary price rise and natural calamity”, a Cabinet note said.The government hopes scaling back the ECA 1955 will help drive up investment in cold storages and the food supply chain. Cold storages are refrigerated warehouses that can store perishables for up to six months. Refrigerated old stocks can cool food prices in times of scarcity. The Cabinet also followed up on Sitharaman’s announcement to free up farm trade by approving ‘The Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020’. The ordinance will effectively bring the curtains down on the decades-old agricultural produce market committees regulations (APMC) system that regulates buying and selling of farm produce.APMC regulations require farmers to only sell to licensed middlemen in notified markets, usually in the same area where farmers reside, rather than in an open market, scuttling price discovery.Ushered in during the 1960s, APMC regulations were meant to protect farmers from distress selling. Over time, these have often acted as cartels and monopolies, evidence suggests. In December 2010, when onion prices peaked, a probe by the country’s statutory anti-monopoly body, the Competition Commission of India, revealed that one firm accounted for nearly a fifth of the total onion trade for that month at Lasalgoan APMC, Asia’s largest onion market in Maharashtra’s Nashik.These reforms in “agricultural marketing” have been a long time in the making and various government panels and economists have often argued for changing existing structures of agricultural trade.The government’s 2017 ‘Doubling of Farmers’ Income’ report had called for greater liberalisation of the farm sector by “removing laws that force farmers to sell to local monopolies”.The ordinance will pave the way for barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade of farm goods outside the physical premises of markets notified under APMCs, the Cabinet note said. The Cabinet also approved ‘The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020’, which will effectively usher new rules for contract farming and futures. These rules have not yet been notified. “The ordinance will empower farmers for engaging with processors, aggregators, large retailers, exporters etc., on a level playing field without any fear of exploitation,” the Cabinet’s note said.The ordinance is the first Indian law to shift the risk of farming from farmers to large buyers and aggregators by potentially ushering a legal framework where contract farming will be undertaken at pre-assured prices. This will protect farmers from price crashes. “There could be initial hiccups though. States might have to be taken on board and issues of risk mitigation have to be addressed,” Bhanumurthy said. “On the whole, these are far-reaching reforms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-can-now-sell-produce-outside-states-notified-markets/story-RvQKsFEirrRg8CX8ucatqM.html

Baluch was sanctioned in 2015 by the US treasury department, which emphasised his role in “the Taliban and Al-Qaida nexus”, the report added.It is believed the three Indians were part of a group of seven engineers kidnapped from Afghanistan’s northern Baghlan province in May 2018. One of the men was freed in March last year and the fate of the others remains unknown.The engineers were working on power projects run by the Afghan government when they were kidnapped.At the time of the release of the three engineers last year, the Indian government had declined to provide details about how they were freed.The UN report, issued late last month, had focused on the close links between the Afghan Taliban and al-Qaeda and the presence of a large number of foreign fighters in Afghanistan, including some 6,500 Pakistani terrorists. The Pakistani fighters include members of the Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/abducted-indian-engineers-were-freed-in-exchange-for-taliban-members-un-report/story-cyiTcMXtZBqWd2PlPay5nM.html

We seized one of the three on May 27 but there are two more out there, possibly somewhere in Budgam and Kulgam areas,” a top counter-terror official told Hindustan Times.There had been a barrage of intelligence inputs over the last two months about plans by Jaish terrorists to carry out major strikes targeting security forces.The Santro car packed with explosives that was seized by security forces on May 27 was the first of these planned attacks. It was intercepted when it was being taken to a Jaish terrorist Sameer Ahmed Dar of Kakpora, Pulwama by an overground worker.Sameer Ahmed Dar is a relative of Adil Dar, the suicide bomber who drove his Maruti Echo vehicle into a CRPF convoy on 14 February 2019 killing 40 troopers. This terror attack was followed by an Indian launching air strike on a terror facility in Pakistan’s Balakot, and a subsequent dogfight between the air forces of the two neighbouring countries. This time, Sameer Ahmed Dar had offered to drive the vehicle IED into a security camp.Intelligence reports indicate that one of the likely targets of the car bomb was the 44 Rashtriya Rifles camp at Shadimarg, Rajpora, Pulwama.Vijay Kumar, Inspector General Police of Kashmir Range described Fauji Bhai’s elimination in Wednesday’s encounter as a huge success for the security forces, next only to the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen’s Riyaz Naikoo in Kashmir’s Beighpora area of Awantipora last month.Kumar said it could not be verified that he is related to JeM chief Maulana Masood Azhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-jaish-bombmaker-killed-hunt-for-2-missing-car-bombs-in-kashmir-is-on/story-bE8xmHFJEia3pmt5lM1ZyK.html
04-06-2020||India||The invincible India: This Ram-Rahman duo prays together for the world to heal||One of the most moving pictures clicked on Eid, it summarises India’s true spirit! You see two police officers, one a Hindu and the other a Muslim, praying to their respective Gods on the auspicious occasion for the world to heal. On Eid, head constable Askar Khan was on duty in an idgah in Amroha, Uttar Pradesh to enforce the lockdown. When it was time for namaz, Khan prayed to Allah while his boss, SHO Ram Prasad Sharma, stood beside him and did his puja. “As I saw Khan offering namaz, I felt a positive aura. I closed my eyes and did my puja, praying for the world to heal. I think someone took the picture in that moment,” he says.Sharma says that Khan is like a brother to him, and they have been fighting against coronavirus together. “We have fought the deadly virus together. Khan is an amazing person who can even recite Hanuman Chalisa and Gayatri Mantra. And he never misses his namaz and roza. On Eid, we prayed to God together and it was such a happy feeling,” says Sharma.Humbled by the praise, Khan, a native of Gwalra village near Aligarh, says Sharma is an inspiration for him and for the entire city. “Sab ka marg darshan karte hain woh. Us din, jab main namaaz ada kar raha tha, sahib ke mann mein na jaane kya aaya ki woh bhi bhakti mein leen ho gaye (He is the guiding force for all. That day, when I was offering namaaz, don’t know what he felt that he also immersed himself in bhakti),” says Khan.Khan’s father used to offer namaaz five times a day, and that’s how he picked up the habit. And Khan also learnt Gayatri Mantra in his childhood. “There was an Arya Samaj Mahavidyala in my village. I used to attend the hawan there and recite Gayatri Mantra. I get a lot of peace in bhakti, whether it is namaaz or reciting mantras,” says Khan.Khan later learnt Hanuman Chalisa from his friends in the police station.“Those who have very shallow knowledge of religion poison minds. Khuda, Ram, Allah…they are all one. Antar sirf bhashaon ka hai. (just the languages differ),” says Khan.The policeman says that Hindus and Muslims have always lived as one in his village, sharing joy and grief.“Jab bhi Gwalra mein koi baraat aati thi, hum sab mil kar aadar satkaar karte ki gaun ki badnami na ho, Hindu Muslim ka fark beech mein kadapi nahin aaya (Whenever a baraat came to my village, we used to welcome it together to maintain the reputation of our village, there was no difference between Hindus and Muslims),” he says.Khan praises SHO Ram Prasad Sharma for keeping people in Amroha united in a similar fashion. “The atmosphere here is always of love, peace, unity. People celebrate all the festivals together, and the bond is so strong that no one can break it,” he says.The picture of the two cops praying on Eid went viral as soon as someone put it up on social media.IPS Rahul Srivastava says the picture is a celebration our age-old tradition of religious harmony, the richest legacy of India that defines us as Indians. “Once we don the khaki uniform, the boundaries of cast, creed, and religion cease to exist for us forever. Selfless service to human beings is our only religion. I love the way this picture captures the essence of togetherness that India is known for,” he says.“I saw this viral picture on social media. Pluralism will always be the bedrock of our nation. I salute both the cops,” says Utsav Bains, lawyer, Supreme Court.People like Khan and Sharma define the India we love!This is the India that’s worth dying for!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-invincible-india-this-ram-raheem-duo-is-keeping-almora-united/story-BP4OzyqiCJ5dS0D01HLIYN.html

Adhir Saiyadh, a ham radio enthusiast, claims he got a response from the Crew Dragon astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken while trying to connect with the International Space Station, reports news agency ANI.“I was on video call with a student explaining how to connect to ISS. It was then that I got a response,” the 58-year-old Ahmedabad resident told ANI. Gujarat: Adhir Saiyadh, a ham radio enthusiast from Ahmedabad, got a response from SpaceX Crew Dragon's astronauts while trying to connect with International Space Station; says,"I was on video call with a student explaining how to connect to ISS, it was then that I got response" pic.twitter.com/QdqnP7u4wqAccording to another report in Ahmedabad Mirror, Saiyadh got connected around the time the astronauts were giving the viewers of NASA TV an interactive tour of the cockpit. “I was on video call with a friend from Valsad, explaining to him the features of a mobile application that helps track ISS. He asked me if we can connect with ISS. I realised that the capsule was to pass over India around then and I decided to try my luck. I coincidentally got connected to their frequency and received a response from one of the commandants of the capsule,” Saiyadh told the Ahmedabad Mirror.A qualified engineer, Saiyadh told the publication that the experience “felt personal” as he got a response from astronaut Doug Hurley when he got connected. He added that the call made him feel that he too, “was a part of the history they made.”In a first of its kind spaceflight, entrepreneur Elon Musk’s company SpaceX became the first private entity to carry NASA astronauts into orbit. A Crew Dragon capsule atop a Falcon 9 rocket, both developed by SpaceX, with Hurley and Behnken, lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center at 3.22 pm EDT on May 30 and docked with the ISS around 19 hours later. The SpaceX’s Crew Dragon flight was also the first time in 11 years that NASA astronauts were launched into space in an American space vehicle and from US soil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-engineer-says-he-got-connected-to-spacex-nasa-spaceflight-report/story-dRuYRQlks4cuHnnvKboneK.html

04-06-2020||India||Floyd protests: Indian-American hailed as hero after he opens his home for over 70 protesters||An Indian-American, who opened the doors of his home here to over 70 people demonstrating against the custodial killing of George Flyod, has emerged as a hero after he rescued the strangers from the clutches of the police, according to US media reports.The death of 46-year-old African-American, George Floyd, last week in Minneapolis has led to one of the biggest civic unrest in the history of America. Rahul Dubey, who lives in Washington DC, accommodated the large number of people in his house with some adjusting on the couch, some finding space in the rooms, while some were gratified to get rest even on the ledges of the bathtub.“There’s about 75 people in my house. Some have got couch space. There’s a family, a mother and daughter here, that I gave my son’s room to so they get some peace and quiet. Yeah, even the ledges of the bathtub, and no one’s bitching. They’re happy—no, they’re not happy. They’re safe. They’re cheering. “They’re backing each other,” Rahul Dubey, 44, told Esquire magazine in an interview on Tuesday.The day after the Monday’s protests, Dubey appeared in major news media outlets and was hailed as a saviour as those who took shelter in his house started tweeting about it. “Rahul saved lives last night,” one Black Lives Matter activist wrote on Twitter. “He ended this with an inspirational speech about not giving up and keeping up the peaceful fight. What a guy. Thank you Rahul.” “I’m at a house in DC after being pepper sprayed and knocked down by the police. There are about 100 of us in a house surrounded by cops. All the neighbours on this street opened their doors and are tending to protesters. The cops corralled us on this street and sprayed us down,” Allison Lane, one of the protesters, tweeted.In an interview to ABC News affiliate WJLA, Dubey said that it was about 8:30 p.m. that he was sitting outside and saw police set up a brigade on 15 St. and Swann St. that turned into a holding area. People started sitting on his porch and asked if they could charge their phone and use his bathroom, he told the news channel. The protesters left his home after the curfew ended 6 am Tuesday.“I don’t think there was even a choice in what I did, to be honest. The crowd just came racing through like a tornado. ... We had to keep the door open and just kept grabbing people and pulling them in. It’s the same that you would if it’s a storm, and you would have let anyone into your home, I know that,” he told NBC News.Another protestor, identified as Meka, told BuzzFeed that he along with dozens of other protesters, ran into the home of Dubey on Swan Street and spent more than eight hours inside his house to avoid being arrested by Metropolitan Police Department officers.Dubey told BuzzFeed News that it wasn’t a choice to open his door and provide refuge to the mostly young protesters.“If you had seen what was going on in front of my eyes, there was no choice. People were getting pepper-sprayed and beaten and slammed to the ground,” he told the media outlet.“I hope that my 13-year-old son grows up to be just as amazing as they are,” Dubey was quoted as saying by WJLA.Writing for Esquire, Dubey said that his father came to the US as a 19-year-old with just eight dollars in his pocket.“I looked around and saw kids from age 20 to 50 in the house scattered on all three floors and the backyard, and they were safe. They were active. They were asking questions. They were solving problems in little groups, and they are hunkered down here until 6 am. The police have tried to pull them out through trickery like five or six times,” he wrote.“They send decoys to the door, telling them they can’t leave out the front, but if they leave out the back alley, they’ll be safe. I mean, bullshit stuff. They just hijacked the pizza delivery guy for an hour and wouldn’t let us come through. I mean, they faked a 911 call and said ‘yeah, someone called 911,’ but no one did. There’s a lot of emotions,” he said.“I have a 13-year-old son, and luckily he’s with friends and family up in Delaware; he’s coming back tomorrow,” he wrote.“He’s not there, but at the same time, I wish he was because he could see these amazing souls that are in my house are safe and they had every right to be doing what they were doing, and the police didn’t have a right to just beat them down on the street. For now, at least for the next four hours or so, we’re going to be safe here. I’ve never been so excited to get a Ducinni’s pizza in my life,” Dubey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/floyd-protests-indian-american-hailed-as-hero-after-he-opens-his-home-for-over-70-protestors/story-xNnVLoNb77S0IRhrvEAlRM.html
04-06-2020||Editorials||Test, test, test, and test||India’s dashboard showed 216,677 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and 6,005 deaths on Wednesday night. The corresponding numbers for Delhi were 23,645 and 606. The number of cases continues to rise — in India and in Delhi. The country added 9,565 cases on Wednesday; the Capital added 1,513. The pandemic is yet to peak here. This should be a time when testing should be fast, wide, and indiscriminate. We are told that resources, when it comes to testing, are no longer a constraint — that we have the people, reagents, and equipment to test more people, and do so rapidly. We are told that there are techniques such as pooling that can be used, to test many samples all at once and then narrow down on the infected. So, why is it so difficult to get a test? This is true across the country, but especially in Delhi, which recently changed its testing guidelines to say that asymptomatic direct contacts of infected people, including close family members will only be tested if they are high risk — which means they are over a certain age, or have co-morbidities. They will be asked to go into quarantine, but not tested. While some other states, including Maharashtra, which has the most cases in India, allow tests for all asymptomatic direct contacts, they have their own filters that make this difficult. For instance, someone with a cough, but who isn’t in a containment zone, or hasn’t been exposed to an infected person, or hasn’t travelled overseas, will have to jump through hoops to get tested anywhere in India, even in a private laboratory. With positivity rates continuing to remain the same or even rising in many states — this is the proportion of people testing positive to the number of tests done — it’s hard to believe that states are not making testing difficult just to keep their numbers down, and do well in some irrelevant and imaginary contest. Even Kerala, whose testing statistics are dismal, is no exception to this. It is time for the Indian Council for Medical Research to relax testing guidelines, and standardise them across India to ensure that anyone who has the symptoms, or who has had contact with an infected person, or who is in the most-vulnerable group (senior citizens and those with other ailments) can get tested — and that is in the first phase. In the second phase, anyone who wants to get a test — young, old, symptomatic, asymptomatic — should be able to get a test; and the government should pay for those who can’t afford to pay for it themselves. Three months into a pandemic’s run in India, and after 68 days of lockdown, it isn’t acceptable to say the country doesn’t have testing resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/test-test-test-and-test/story-n7C7FpgUE1GGAAhTq0y07L.html
