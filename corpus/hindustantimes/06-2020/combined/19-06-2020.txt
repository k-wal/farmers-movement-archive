19-06-2020||News||How the Galwan Valley tragedy can transform Himalayan geopolitics||The brutal clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers on the night of June 15 has exposed the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)’s well-planned design of stealthily wresting the entire Galwan Valley from India’s control. It also carries a set of underlying messages and possibilities. First, immediately after the incident, PLA’s Western Theatre Command (WTC) issued a statement on June 16, claiming China’s territorial “sovereignty” over the entire Galwan Valley. That was followed by a June 17 statement from Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, that echoed, in verbatim, WTC’s line claiming China’s sovereignty over the Galwan Valley area.Second, it appears to have been triggered by local factors at a micro-level, with, at the most, instructions from WTC headquarters. Clearly, it is a case of a disengagement process not being handled properly at the local level and things going out of control. There have been other violent hand-to-hand clashes in this area since the 2017 Doklam standoff. It turned more violent this time with PLA using more lethal weapons, stones, boulders, rocks wrapped with barbed wire and wooden logs studded with nails. A third, inter-related, point is that the top PLA officials of WTC seem to enjoy more autonomy than other Chinese military theatres. In this case, the Chinese government only seems to have endorsed WTC’s line, which has a specific mandate or a direct and wider strategic direction from Beijing to alter the ground situation in consonance with China’s national vision for western provinces ie Xinjiang and Tibet. It also has a larger focus agenda with regards to securing Chinese interests, including safeguarding China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)-related projects moving just north of the Karakoram Range. PLA views India’s building of strategic roads in Ladakh as potentially causing disruption to the security of the BRI/Chinese Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).Fourth, the incident can either spark greater escalation or actually, counter-intuitively, lead to de-escalation. The Indian Army has lost 20 personnel, including a commanding officer in the vicious attack. This is the biggest military clash in over five decades and the risk of the border standoff escalating into a full-scale confrontation is clearly present. However, unconfirmed reports suggest the Chinese side too suffered “proportionate casualties”, with at least 43 PLA personnel either dead or injured in the clash. If this is the case, then the balance of tragedies is established, and opens up the scope for further de-escalation to continue as agreed upon during military talks held on June 6.What happens now also depends on the political will of the two countries. If the political relationship between India and China is not smooth, the Chinese party leadership may find it hard to control PLA, which is generally seen as more hardline on India. At the same time, the situation can still be brought under control by political and diplomatic interventions at a higher level. The clash has finally compelled both sides to open up talks at the foreign minister-level. However, if China refuses to revert to a pre-standoff status quo position, India may be forced to evict PLA from the Indian side though a military intervention.Whether there is escalation or not is also closely related to how the two sides tell the story of the incident to their people. The Chinese side is not giving the exact figure of casualties. We do not know if they are embarrassed or whether they want to hide the figures from their own people and underplay the incident to prevent escalation. Where does this leave New Delhi? India must respond to China’s move, not just through military means but through a forward-looking strategic, economic and connectivity vision matching China’s BRI project. It must think about reconnecting and resuming old trade links. Ladakh is a geostrategic axis or a pivot point for India to reach out to central Asia, Europe and Russia. The Dorbo-Shayok-DBO road should be called the Ladakh economic corridor. It should be India’s approach to go beyond the Himalayas. Otherwise, India is destined to remain defensive in posture.This, however, is contingent on India reworking the governance priorities in Ladakh. It is the locals who have the best understanding of the border. The region has already remained neglected for a long time due to Article 370 and 35A. The way forward must have several components. First, the Ladakh administration should distribute the entire stretch of vacant land in eastern Ladakh (from Chumur to Karakoram) among the population of the Leh district for agriculture, horticulture and other economic activities. Two, the government must expedite infrastructure airport/road network expansion in eastern Ladakh. The Indian Air Force must reactivate the Fukche/Loma airport for both civilian and military use. Attempts should be made to reopen and refurbish the old Chuchul airport base. Three, authorities must re-populate the area with legal ownership to citizens and not leave the borderland vacant. The government must provide incentives for Changpa nomadic farmers presently settled in Leh (Kharnag-Ling settlement) to return to the borderland areas and encourage them to reactivate their nomadic Rebo herding skills. Security forces should be directed not to prevent their movement along the border areas.Four, large-scale forestation and large-scale grass-sowing activities through aerial seeding and use of drip-irrigation technology must be undertaken. Five, NITI Aayog should prepare a defence-development plan for area development. And six, the Indian Army should revisit the idea of legalising the existing illegal border trade at specific places such as at Dhumtsele and Demchok. Galwan has changed geopolitics in the Himalayas. India must step up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-the-galwan-valley-tragedy-can-transform-himalayan-geopolitics/story-v9IdSlR8DjZYxmMlSIZUYL.html
19-06-2020||News||The micro-challenges to the Make in India campaign||Last year, I was on a family holiday to the United States (US). As the heatwave raged across Texas, we took a break on the beach. We also decided to retrofit the car windows with tint. We found a dealer who showed us a selection of brands of tint films. “This one,” the dealer said, “is from India.” As we drove-off with the sun control on the glass surfaces, we felt proud of sporting a “Made in India” brand.This month, I decided to start my car’s engine after two months of hibernation. On opening the car doors, I realised there was a strong toxic smell of burnt plastic, coming from the faux leather seat covers exposed in the harsh Delhi sun. Recognising the dire need for shade to cool down the cabin temperature, I decided to put sun control film on the glass surfaces in the car.I googled for an appropriate dealer in Delhi and learnt that there is a complete ban on tinting of car windows and windscreens in India. I had been aware that the Indian Motor Vehicle Act had prescribed a standard for light transmission but not that tinting in the aftermarket was completely banned. I researched a bit. Why is this Indian product, available and doing well in the US, but banned in India? Which government entity banned it? When? In that story lies a microcosm of the challenges faced by the Make in India initiative and boosting manufacturing in India. It also illustrates the challenges to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s quest for a self-reliant India, which strongly relies on a thriving domestic industry which is local but acts globally, and is an integral part of global supply chains. In a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed in 2012 at the Supreme Court (SC), a Kolkata-based petitioner prayed that in view of the rising crimes against women, carjacking and such, the black film should be banned. SC banned not only the black film but all films that could be applied to glass surfaces of vehicles. It’s acceptable if the tint in the vehicle’s glass came with the manufacture, which is as per Indian Standards. But the same luminosity, conforming to the Indian standards, is not permissible if the tint is achieved by adding a film. Overnight, the tint film application industry was declared illegal.But the SC appears to have been misled. The PIL stated that tinting in the aftermarket is not allowed even in developed countries. It quoted the examples of the United Kingdom, Germany, and the US. This was quoted in the judgment. But the fact is that tinting, by externally affixing film, is allowed in most countries around the world, including the US; only, on account of the federal nature of the country, the permissible light transmission standards are different. The Indian brand I encountered in the US is recognised as a reputed brand in the international market in more than 80 countries.Adding tint to automobile glasses in a hot country like India has its merits. The cabin heat of a parked car puts the engine under extreme stress as it takes the additional load of the air conditioning system for prolonged periods. Unlike in colder climates, radiation from direct sunlight and its reflection from the ground makes the cabin temperature unbearable.As per a The Energy and Resources Institute report, tinting can save fuels worth a thousand crore as well as reduce Co2 consumption. We must remember that the factory-fitted tinted glass in vehicles comes at a very high price and most cars on Indian roads do not have that. It therefore has the potential to optimise energy resources and contribute to climate sustainability. There are safety benefits as well. A crash may shatter the windscreen but the film will arrest shards of glass from flying. And most importantly, tinting, according to the International Window Film Association, can filter 98% of the harmful, cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.While the order also relied heavily on the perception that having tinted glasses could undermine women’s safety, data on the automobile-related snatching of jewellery and purse, theft of computers from car cabins, humiliation, and harassment to women due to a lack of privacy makes for a strong case in the favour of tinted glass in India. In fact, violent crimes including rapes have taken place after identifying women as passengers in the car and dragging them out. There are some broad lessons. When an industry grows, think carefully — and scientifically — about all elements associated with it before introducing restrictions, either through executive or judicial orders. When an industry is doing well globally, allow it to leverage domestic markets if it is not in violation of the law. Create an enabling environment for it. And only then will India become both self-reliant and a true manufacturing hub.

19-06-2020||News||Opening with care||India is gradually reopening the economy. Home deliveries, in parts, have become functional, workers are returning to factories, shops have started lifting their shutters, and those working from home for months will soon resume their office routines.But in all this, women, as usual, will likely be left behind. This seems paradoxical. Companies have laid out new work from home policies. Chief executive officers talk excitedly about the ease of Zoom calls and the diminished value of travel. With a pandemic-induced work-from-home world, they realise the potential of another talent pool they can tap into—the 120 million secondary-educated women who do not yet participate in paid work. Work from home models can meet the latent demand. In one national survey, over a third of women engaged primarily in domestic activities said that they would prefer paid work if working from home was an option. And this goes beyond theories and surveys. A popular career platform for women in India saw a dramatic rise in the number of women looking to start or restart their careers in recent months. This coincided with a 30% increase in work from home job postings on the platform in March 2020. This seems straightforward. But those who are working from home during the pandemic can attest that, outside the computer screen, there is an equally demanding world—which requires you to answer the doorbell, prepare meals for the family, and look after the children and elders. Such tasks further exacerbate the time constraints women normally face. Even before the pandemic, for every hour of housework—cleaning, nurturing, cooking, teaching, managing— that Indian men put in, women put 10, far higher than the global average of three, and among the highest levels of gender disparity in unpaid work in the world. Even at minimum wage rates, unpaid work could contribute $300 billion to India’s economy.The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has added to the burden of unpaid work that women already carry – by an estimated 30%, according to the consulting firm Dalberg. With schools shut, millions of children are now home for an indefinite period. Due to the threat of the virus, families are wary of letting children in daycare centres or allowing part-time help in their homes. Even as work from home arrangements hold immense promise for women, the absence of reliable care services tilts the balance against them.Steps to ramp up and professionalise India’s care economy will ease up the usual burden on women. Functional care centres for children and older people employing safe and trained domestic workers can help women pursue career options. The absence of extensive national standards or certifications in India for paid childcare—such as mandatory pupil-to-teacher ratios or teacher-training standards—reduces the incentive for childcare providers to raise quality. It also makes it harder for parents to find and evaluate good childcare options. A service industry model, with accredited training and certification, can address the concerns. A public-private approach, where care services are viewed as public goods with powerful economy-wide productivity benefits, is worth trying too.A professionalised care system will reap dual dividends—not just enabling many women to work, but also creating employment for many others. By our estimates, India’s care industry has the potential to absorb up to 10 million women into the workforce and create another four million jobs, a vast majority for women. Some countries have shown evidence to this effect. Mexico’s Day Care Support for Working Mothers programme has generated more than 40,000 paid jobs for (mostly female) community-based care providers and aides, while Singapore has created opportunities for almost 250,000 foreign domestic workers – the demand for care workers in the country is expected to grow up to 300,000 by 2030.The benefits of working women tend to trickle down. For example, when children were enrolled in community daycare centres in Rajasthan for prolonged periods, they showed gains in nutrition, hygiene, cognition, and school readiness.One way to go about creating an effective care economy is by implementing “Bridgital” solutions (technology that leads to more and better jobs). Childcare workers—whether attached to a care-centre or are home-based—can be integrated into a cloud-based management system that allows them to report completed tasks, monitor health and other outcomes, and undergo training. This will allow real-time monitoring by supervisors and better feedback to parents. Care professionals can acquire portable credentials on such platforms, while organisations that embrace such services and standards will have an edge in talent recruitment.Without solving for care work, we cannot leverage the opportunity offered by work from home arrangements. By acknowledging the economic rationale of the care economy, India can make it easier for women to work for pay—and equally reap the productivity gains of doing so.

19-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi health minister Jain moved to pvt hospital after condition worsens||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain was moved to a private hospital in the city for further treatment of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) because his condition deteriorated. The 55-year-old minister had tested positive for the infection on Wednesday, after initially testing negative.He had been admitted to the Delhi government-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital in Tahirpur with a high-grade fever and low oxygen saturation on Monday night. He had attended an all-party meeting held by the union home minister Amit Shah the same day.He was put on intermittent oxygen to manage the symptoms. He had developed pneumonia, a known complication of Covid-19.“The oxygen support was removed once his saturation level reached about 97%. However, he was not able to maintain the saturation and had to be put on oxygen intermittently. But he was doing well. Surprisingly, he started becoming breathless in the morning. And, the latest CT scan showed that the pneumonia patch has increased,” said a doctor from the hospital, on condition of anonymity.He was moved to the intensive care unit of the hospital in the morning. As his symptoms worsened, the minister was shifted to Max hospital, Saket, according to sources in both hospitals. He continues to be on oxygen support. He is being treated by a critical care team. He continues to be “stable,” and is likely to get plasma therapy tonight, according to hospital sources. The minister has no co-morbid conditions. The infection usually causes severe symptoms in older people and those with co-morbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, kidney and heart disease.After Jain was shifted, union home minister Amit Shah tweeted, “Praying for the speedy recovery of Shri Satyendra Jain, Health Minister of Delhi who is battling with COVID-19 infection.”Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said, “Unfortunately, the doctors found in his CT scan his lung infection and pneumonia have increased. He’s been feeling exhausted and giddy since the morning. All treatment and shifting to another hospital will be done on doctors’ advice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-health-minister-jain-moved-to-pvt-hospital-after-condition-worsens/story-z1O2HAgp4rtD957QDtrcJM.html
19-06-2020||City||Delhi govt to recruit medical and nursing students to staff Covid hospitals||New DelhiThe Delhi government has decided to hire final-year students of post-graduate medical courses such as MD/MS and DNB, as well as final year under-graduate and post-graduate nursing students, to staff the additional intensive care unit (ICU) beds being created in state government-run hospitals. The students would be hired for a period of six months and would be paid an honorarium, the Delhi government said following a meeting of the medical superintendent of Covid-19 hospitals and top health officials with acting health minister Manish Sisodia.The meeting was held to discuss plans to increase ICU infrastructure in view of the rising number of cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the city.Currently, there are 706 ventilator beds in both government and private hospitals, of which 64% are already occupied, according to data on the ‘Delhi Corona’ app.HT had in its June 17 report pointed out that the government was working on increasing bed strength but the shortage of manpower was a challenge.Dr Mahesh Verma, vice-chancellor of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, with which most of the students are affiliated, has been tasked with recruitment and deployment of the required number of students over the next four days. He has been asked to recommend the stipend to be paid.The ICU staff shortage was pointed out as the main reason for not being able to ramp up the capacity. Currently, there are 173 ventilator beds in the Delhi-government run hospitals. HT had earlier reported that the Delhi government would be receiving 200 additional ventilators from the central government. In addition to that, the state government plans to buy 300 more ventilators.The government has also purchased 2,000 oxygen concentrators for patients with moderate illness. The machine selectively removes nitrogen from the ambient air to concentrate it to 93/5 oxygen and provides it to the patient at about 5lts/minute speed.“Most of the existing beds in the hospital currently have oxygen supply for the patients, and in the next 10 days, and all the other beds will have the oxygen supply attached to them in a few days. The bed capacity, as well as all the infrastructure and manpower assistance, will be given to all the hospitals as and when required by them. The Delhi government has directed to increase the ICU bed capacity in all the big dedicated Covid-19 hospitals,” said Sisodia after the meeting.Dr SK Sarin, who was part of the initial five-member expert committee constituted in March to look at increasing Delhi’s capacity to handle Covid-19 cases, said, “We should think of out-of-the-way solutions to address this pandemic. With a few out-of-the-box ideas, we can enhance the existing capacity of ICU beds in the hospitals. We should also think how we can recruit new manpower including health professionals and experts in these hospitals.”The question on staffing issues for the makeshift hospitals in stadiums and banquet halls still remains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-to-recruit-medical-and-nursing-students-to-staff-covid-hospitals/story-rXBilG7xe7SpXzHCRJsVzI.html
19-06-2020||City||450 beds in Burari hospital for Covid treatment||New DelhiAround 450 of the 700 beds in the newly constructed hospital in Burari will be used for the treatment of patients with the coronavirus disease, according to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Of these, 250 beds will have oxygen support.On Friday, deputy chief minister and acting health minister Manish Sisodia visited the hospital to take stock of the preparedness measures in the hospital.“Almost all preparations for Covid-19 treatment have been done here. There will be 450 beds in this hospital for the treatment of Corona patients, and every third bed will have oxygen supply attached to it. Around 125 beds already have oxygen supply, and 125 beds will be provided oxygen through oxygen cylinders,” said Kejriwal.HT had reported in May that the hospital was likely to be used for the treatment for patients of Covid-19. Two other upcoming hospitals in Ambedkar Nagar and Dwarka might also be used for the treatment of the people with the infection if the number of cases goes up.The three hospitals will together add over 2,500 beds to the existing 11,770 beds in the Delhi government-run hospitals.Of the 30,000 hospital beds that the government is in the process of procuring, 1,200 Covid-19 beds are likely to be added in these three newly constructed hospitals.The government has said that as per projections, 1.5 lakh beds will be needed for the treatment of Covid-19 patients by the end of July. This estimate is based on the recommendations of a five-member expert committee that had said that Delhi will likely see 1 lakh cases by the end of the month and would need 15,000 beds for the treatment of those severely ill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/450-beds-in-burari-hospital-for-covid-treatment/story-jt0vyku0gnhYtn6StV9XtN.html

19-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi L-G orders mandatory 5 day institutional quarantine for Covid-19 patients||Covid-19 patients in Delhi under home quarantine so far will now have to undergo mandatory five-day institutional quarantine, Lieutenant-General Anil Baijal said on Friday.The L-G’s order added that after the five-day institutional quarantine, asymptomatic Covid-19 patients will be sent for home quarantine, according to news agency PTI. “Five days institutional quarantine of each case under home-quarantine is to be made mandatory and, thereafter, (they) will be sent for home-isolation, except in cases where symptoms require further hospitalization,” Baijal said in his order.However, the city’s AAP government has called the L-G’s decision “arbitrary” and said it will “seriously harm” Delhi. The Arvind Kejriwal government has also asked the L-G to reconsider his decision.Saying that there was already a serious shortage of doctors and nurses for treating Covid-19 patients in the national capital, the AAP government added that manpower is already stretched and large quarantine centres would be needed to accommodate thousands of asymptomatic people.“L-G’s decision on home isolation will discourage many people from getting tested and (this in turn) will spread coronavirus further, PTI quoting Delhi government as saying.The L-G’s order came on a day that Delhi recorded yet another highest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases. With 3,137 new infections reported on Friday, the national capital’s tally crossed the 53,000-mark. while the death toll rose to 2,035, according to PTI. Meanwhile, the government is gearing up to augment ICU bed capacity in the city’s dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Friday.In another development during the day, the Delhi government tested 12,680 people for the coronavirus infection using Rapid Antigen Testing kits and found at least 951 positive samples.“Today, 12,680 people in Delhi were tested for Covid-19 using Rapid Antigen Testing Kits, out of whom 951 people were found positive,” Sisodia said in a tweet.

19-06-2020||City||No alternatives to cater to demands of “non-China” products, say Noida traders||Noida: Amid the India-China standoff and call for boycott of Chinese items, customers are specifically asking dealers about details of products and if there are any alternatives. Traders, however, say alternatives are few. “A number of traders have been calling up since the last two days stating that customers are demanding products of Indian make. They are specifically checking whether the product they are buying is from China. If locally produced goods aren’t available, customers seek non-Chinese alternates. Traders want to sell local items but the issue is that there are very few alternatives,” Sushil Kumar Jain, president, Sector 18 market association and Delhi-NCR head of the Confederation of All India Traders Association.Retailers, especially those dealing in electronics, pointed out that while the market is dominated by China-made products there is dearth of Indian brands or even those coming from other countries such as South Korea, US, Japan or European nations, which narrows down options.“This is for the first time we have seen that customers are enquiring about the make of a product. We don’t have many alternatives available as the mobile phone segment is dominated by Chinese brands. There were very few customers who did not mind buying products of Chinese brands when they got to know that the product was manufactured in India,” said Rahul Gupta, who owns a mobile phone store in Sector 18.He adds that while the market was already down due to the pandemic, these new consumer trends are further affecting business.“Most customers are aware of brands. The issue is that the Indian alternatives are not competent enough and their production is low. The same problem persists with Japanese and Taiwanese brands. American brands, on the other hand, are very expensive” Gupta said.Anita Singh, another trader, says she also incurred losses due to lack of affordable local alternatives.“Customers are asking for non-Chinese brands, but the market is not ready as we don’t have too many Indian products in the market. Even gift wraps come from China. I lost business of around ₹36,000 on a single order on Thursday as the company wanted about 60 pieces of gift items of Indian make, which were not available,” said Singh, who owns a stationary store in Savitri market, Sector 18.Some consumers, meanwhile, said they did not mind losing money over this. Dr Arvind Mishra, who lives in Noida, cancelled an SUV he had booked last year, of which he was awaiting delivery.“I am exploring other alternatives, and no longer want to give business to China in anyway. The booking amount for the car was ₹50,000 of which the dealer might deduct some portion, but it’s okay,” he said.At the nearby Atta market, traders say they are working on a future course of action. “We are going to have a meeting with traders soon about the future course of action,” said Dr CB Jha, head of the Atta Market, Noida.Jain says such consumer behaviour does incur losses to traders who have already paid for their stocks. “As customers have started to ask for locally manufactured goods, we businessmen are also learning. For instance, for the upcoming festival of Raksha Bandhan, rakhis worth millions were imported from China every year, but with prevailing market current, traders will look for local alternatives,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-alternatives-to-cater-to-demands-of-non-china-products-say-noida-traders/story-JmytZeGcuUWBmOO2nRWBGJ.html
19-06-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana deputy commissioner reviews arrangements ahead of monsoons||Ahead of monsoons, deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Sharma on Friday conducted a meeting with officials of the municipal corporation and irrigation and drainage departments, among others, to take stock of arrangements.The district administration has set up district-level flood control room. Besides, directions have also been issued for setting up control rooms at sub-division/tehsil level. District heads of all departments will work as nodal officers for necessary arrangements and communications.The DC instructed officials to constantly coordinate with each other via WhatsApp groups to closely monitor the situation during monsoons. He directed them to keep their mobile phones switched on round-the-clock. Sharma told the sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) to install wireless public address system in vehicle to alert people of floods. Also National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and army officials were asked to take stock of sensitive places along with administration teams before monsoon hits the city. He said that SDMs must ensure working of the flood control rooms round the clock.Drainage department officials were told to keep a close vigil on all spots which were identified as sensitive during inspections conducted earlier. The DC said he will also keep a check on water level of the Sutlej river.The irrigation department’s officials were directed to ensure the cleanliness of distributaries to save crops incase of floods.

The district also reported three more deaths, taking the toll to 55. The total number of patients afflicted by Covid-19 in the state stands at 9,743. The district conducted 790 new tests on Friday, the highest conducted in a single day so far, yielding a test-positivity rate of 18% — the same as on Thursday.The dip in the district’s test-positivity rate, officials said, is a result of increased testing, and bodes well for the quality of surveillance. “The TPR in early June started going to levels exceeding 50%, which indicated the need to conduct more tests.With our new lab in Gurugram, we have been able to ramp up the numbers and cast a wider net. As such, fewer samples are turning positive since Thursday,” said Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram. The average TPR for June, however, still stands at 43%, up from nine percent in May. Experts said that the increase in testing, as seen over the past two days, would need to be scaled up even further. “While increasing tests is always a hopeful sign, district health data shows that in the past, testing numbers were reduced when pooled testing was discontinued. At the very least, this increase needs to be sustained,” said Dheeraj Singh, a city-based data scientist tracking state and district level trends in Covid-19 data. A total of 122 patients in the district were also discharged after treatment on Friday, taking Gurugram’s recovery rate to 55.4%, up from 54% on Thursday. A total of 1,788 patients are currently being treated at various hospitals in Gurugram. At least, 10 patients in the district, of a total of 19 in the state, are currently on ventilator support, according to state health bulletin data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-breaches-4-000-mark-conducts-highest-number-of-tests-in-a-single-day/story-t0LmStTzgEXDE6HRUYWbjM.html
19-06-2020||City||Gurugram likely to consider charges fixed for Covid-19 treatment in Delhi’s pvt hospitals||Gurugram: As a committee formed by the Centre has capped the charges for Covid-19 treatment in Delhi’s private hospitals, the Gurugram administration on Friday said that the national capital’s price packages would have “an influence” on the proposed rates for treatment in the district. Stating that since Delhi-NCR is now being considered as one unit for Covid-19 management, Ashok Sangwan, divisional commissioner, said, “The treatment cost fixed for Delhi’s private hospitals does have an influence on the package we are proposing to the state government. The final decision has to be taken by the state. We have submitted the proposed rates.”The Haryana government is in the process of fixing rates for the Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals in the state. On Friday, the committee, led by NITI Aayog member Dr V K Paul, fixed the rates charged by private hospitals in Delhi for isolation beds, intensive care unit (ICU) without ventilator support and ICU with ventilator support. According to the committee, an isolation bed per day would cost Rs 8,000-10,000, which was earlier somewhere between Rs 24,000 -25,000. The treatment in an ICU without a ventilator can cost between Rs 13,000 and Rs 15,000. It increases up to Rs 18,000 if a critical patient requires ventilator support. The rates include cost of PPEs and medicines. Earlier, without the price check, the treatment cost requiring ventilator exceeded up to Rs 54,000.In Gurugram too, Covid-19 treatment cost of a critical patient in private hospitals for a day ranges from Rs 50,000 to Rs 80,000.On Thursday, Union home minister Amit Shah had chaired a meeting on Covid-19 management in Delhi-NCR. Sangwan, who was present in the meeting, said, “A mandate has been given by the central government to consider Delhi-NCR as one unit. For fixing the treatment cost of Covid-19, we would be considering the figures recommended by other affected districts in the NCR region. A recommendation committee has also been constituted in Faridabad. We are taking inputs from them also.” Mentioning that deciding the price package is a complex process, Sangwan said, “There are different requirements in deciding the overall cost. It includes the cost of PPEs, medicines, specialized services, tertiary care, among others. The final price package will be released soon.” The nodal officers appointed for hospital management in the district were unavailable for comment on Friday. On June 15, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had constituted a committee, comprising the divisional commissioner, MCG commissioner and chief medical officer (CMO), to submit its suggestions on capping the Covid treatment cost by Friday. On Wednesday, the Gurugram administration officials had said that they were looking at Ahmedabad model, and the models of states like Maharashtra and Telangana to derive a conclusion on capping the treatment cost. Also, a press conference was held on Friday by the officials of the district administration, which included Sangwan, deputy commissioner Amit Khatri, and Municipal Corporation of Gurugram commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh. Khatri said, “Gurugram is the health capital for having good infrastructure. There is enough availability of beds to treat Covid-19 patients.” It was the first time in the past three months since the Covid-19 crisis started in the city that the officials addressed the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-likely-to-consider-charges-fixed-for-covid-19-treatment-in-delhi-s-pvt-hospitals/story-D1oHcsAEnrvJJH54jHB1LK.html
19-06-2020||Mumbai||Chase the virus, form task forces: CM to district collectors, civic chiefs||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday gave an earful to some of the district and civic chiefs for the rising rate of Covid-19 cases, fatalities and poor tracing of the suspected contacts in their areas. The district and civic authorities have been asked to rigorously follow the principle of ‘chase the virus’ and constitute task forces of expert doctors to reduce the fatality rate.Thackeray held a video conference with district collectors and municipal commissioners of a few districts with high mortality rate and poor implementation of the guidelines. Thackeray expressed his unhappiness over the smaller number of tracing of the high and low-risk contacts in Mira-Bhayander and Pune, and high fatalities in districts like Dhule, Aurangabad etc.“The addition of the new patients constantly in some districts and cities is worrisome. The spread can be contained only by tracing the suspects and their identification. The laidback approach towards the implementation of the state policies while combating the virus would not be tolerated,” said Thackeray. He added that every district should have its task force of the expert doctors on the lines of the one at the state level. “The Task Force in Mumbai has helped us in reducing the death rate. A similar team should be formulated at the district level with the help of an expert and experienced doctors. It will help the district authorities to follow the guidelines issued by the union health and family welfare ministry while treating the virus,” Thackeray said during the video conference. State health minister Rajesh Tope asked the authorities to involve doctors associated with the Indian Medical Association in the task force. He said the non-Covid patients should not be undermined when there is a possibility of the rise in the monsoon related ailments. Chief secretary Ajoy Mehta said that the spread rate is high where the tracing of the contacts of any positive patient is less than 10 people. He also directed the collectors to minutely monitor the apartments or buildings with positive patients. Commissioners Mira-Bhayander, Pune, Aurangabad were told to go in for more tracing and testing. Mira-Bhayander administration has been asked to improve its doubling rate which is just around eight-nine days. The state’s doubling rate of cases has improved to 25.9 days on June 16, from 3.5 days on March 31 and 10.2 days on April 30 and 20.1 days on May 31. The case fatality rate of the state stands at 4.77% against the national rate of 3.30%.Mira-Bhayandar has reported 1,995 cases and has reported 99 deaths. Pune has reported 14,000 cases and has seen 610 deaths so far. Aurangabad has reported 3,064 cases and 168 fatalities. District and civic authorities apprised the CM with the measures taken by them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/chase-the-virus-form-task-forces-cm-to-district-collectors-civic-chiefs/story-pyjeUzVVXznRxkrR5N9eEJ.html
19-06-2020||Mumbai||The youth sees disloyalty in using Chinese apps||The events of the past few days have forced the youngsters to ponder as to why there are Chinese apps in their phone anymore.And the resolute has grown only stronger. Rohi Asrani, a second year BMS student from Jai Hind College in Mumbai, says it’s time we see through China’s dubious plans. “With Covid-19, China has gained a special hate from each and every country of the world,” she says. According to reports, the Indian intelligence has red-flagged 50 China linked apps, popular among youngsters, that may pose a threat to national security. These include Zoom, Tik Tok and UC Browser among others. “If by not using or avoiding any of these apps or even Chinese products, I can do my bit for my country, I’d do it over and over again. An app like Zoom is something that everyone is using today but it can be easily replaced by others like Google meet or Skype. And honestly, the Tik Tok trends have had a negative impact on the youth anyway,” adds Rohi. Yogini Mangloorkar and Shlok Malpani from Pillai College in Navi Mumbai feel that once the youth steps up to act, it can go a long way in dethroning Chinese applications from of populist dominance that it currently enjoys. “If we, as youngsters, can help our government and economy, by not supporting Chinese enterprises in any kind, then why hesitate?,” says Shlok, reasoning the serious allegations these apps have faced over the breach of privacy. Yogini adds to that the “unwise Chinese action towards India.” “I wish that everyone realises how serious this issue is,” she cautions, before stressing on the importance of using Indian applications.Chaitra Pandurangi, a student of LS Raheja College in Worli, is of the opinion that these apps have turned out to be major contributors to the ever-growing Chinese economy, and today’s situation calls for a complete boycott. And she raises an important point when she asks, “But what are available alternatives?” The government’s call for Make in India should resonate now more than ever. “The government should encourage Indian software companies to take a step towards developing apps more effective and efficient so that they will get promoted, too,” she adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/the-youth-sees-disloyalty-in-using-chinese-apps/story-BK1wQi2VZ2OGc0RDGbnQdN.html
19-06-2020||Gurugram||Outstation students raise concerns, seek clarity on final-year examinations||A week after the state government issued directions for conducting physical examinations for final-year undergraduate and post-graduate students in universities and colleges in the state, both students and principals await clarity on various aspects of the examinations that are supposed to take place from July 1 onwards. Students living outside the city, in particular, have expressed their apprehensions regarding the exams as city hostels remain closed and options for public transport are still limited. Universities and colleges have been asked to conduct all terminal exams by July 31 and declare the results by August 7. As per the government guidelines, issued on June 12, hostels in colleges will continue to remain closed. Students, outside the state, especially women students, have informed their principals that in the absence of hostels, looking for accommodation in the city would be difficult. Laxmi Bai, a final-year student at Government Girls College, Sector 14, said that commuting for exams would be difficult for outstation students like her. The Mahendragarh resident used to stay at the college hostel prior to the lockdown. “The guidelines mention that hostels will continue to remain closed throughout the exam period. We will have to commute for each paper which will be a challenging task in the absence of public transport. Not everyone owns a vehicle,” said Laxmi. She added that those who live in hostels like her had similar concerns but they had been told that while students from the state were supposed to appear for the physical exam, while those from other states could take the exam later. Laxmi added that preparing for the exams would be difficult for most students like her since they did not have books with them. “Most students were at home for the Holi break when the lockdown was imposed. We didn’t get a chance to go back and collect our books. Most of us are managing with study material available online,” she said. Pooja Khullar, principal, Dronacharya Government College, said that the college had raised various concerns and shared around 30 suggestions regarding the guidelines with the higher education department. “Hostels are closed in all colleges while exams are scheduled to take place in July. All college administrators have pointed out the concerns raised by women students from different districts. We don’t know where they will stay. Most women students have also said that their parents wouldn’t allow them to travel alone during the pandemic with little public transport,” said Khullar.She said that were many challenges regarding physical examinations and with very little time remaining, the college was awaiting more clarity so that it can plan ahead.Satyamanyu Yadav, principal of Government College in Sector 9, also said that he had written to the department seeking the date sheet and clarity on exam centres which would allow outstation students to plan ahead of time.Officials from the higher education department couldn’t be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/outstation-students-raise-concerns-seek-clarity-on-final-year-examinations/story-3J1n8whjHIXmrBsBI1ekqO.html
19-06-2020||Chandigarh||Main gunman in Sector 33 firing arrested||Amritsar resident Nitin Nahar, believed to be the key gunman in the firing at the Sector 33 home of hotelier and businessman Rakesh Singla, was arrested by Punjab Police in the Holy City on Friday.The firing at Singla’s home on May 31 targeted his younger brother and liquor baron Arvind Singla.Nahar of Indira Colony, Chabal Road, Amritsar, was captured near the city’s Colour Resorts, Attari Road, with his associate Bikramjit Singh, who had reportedly helped shelter him.He had been engaged by gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, currently incarcerated in a Rajasthan prison.The arrests came in an intelligence-led operation by a joint team of Amritsar (rural) police and organised crime control unit (OCCU), a police spokesperson said.Nahar had used a .32 bore pistol in the firing. Karan Sharma, a hotel management student who had also been involved in the firing, was arrested on June 6.Two pistols of .32 calibre and .315 calibre with 40 and 10 live cartridges, respectively, were recovered from Nahar’s possession, which police believed was used in the crime.Acting on Bishnoi’s orders Nahar while being questioned revealed that he had been asked to carry out similar activities in Punjab, Chandigarh and Rajasthan by Bishnoi. He also said he was a close associate of Bobby Malhotra, a gangster with links to Bishnoi and currently lodged in Ferozepur Jail.Malhotra on May 31 had directed Nahar to carry out the attack and a black Audi car was sent by Bishnoi to pick him up from Ludhiana and drop him at the outskirts of Chandigarh. From there, he was picked up in a silver Ford Ikon with the other gunmen and taken to Sector 33 where he fired a few rounds.From here, he was dropped off at Kharar and then taken to a hideout in Amritsar in a white Bolero car on Malhotra’s directions.Nahar is also involved in three other firing incidents in Amritsar, two targeting his rival group members Vipin Kumar (in January 2020) and Love Kumar (in February 2020). The third one in April this year involved a man who had filed a complaint against him in an old case at Chabal Road .Toyota Fortuner: One car used for two shootouts as Bishnoi eyes big stakes in liquor businessA Toyota Fortuna used to ferry gunmen in both incidents of firing at sectors 33 and 9 in Chandigarh, one at the home of a liquor baron’s brother and the other at a liquor shop, within 48 hours on May 31 and June 2, has been recovered by police.Both shootouts were masterminded by gangster Lawrence Bishnoi for a stake in the thriving liquor business in the region. Of the two liquor contractors from Chandigarh being targeted, police officials say, these were “planned to intimidate liquor contractors of Chandigarh and thereby capture stakes in liquor shop contracts, similar to what has been done in Haryana.”The police on Thursday night recovered the vehicle from the farmhouse of one Manjinder Singh Virk in Kumhar Majra village in Kurukshetra. Virk, also a member of Bishnoi’s gang, was on the run. He was involved in firing at a liquor contractor in Shahbad, Punjab, and had attempt to murder and Arms Act cases registered against him in Haryana.Investigations in the Chandigarh firing cases revealed that Virk with two other men, Mandeep alias Jeona of Ambala and Ranjit Singh alias Janty of Ismailabad, Kurukshetra, accompanied shooters Amarpreet alias Rinku alias Topi and Devender Chawla for executing the firing incident at the Sector 9 liquor shop.A night before executing the crime, all the men stayed in a flat in Kharar, Punjab.The Toyota Fortuner was used in the Sector 33 firing for carrying some gunmen who were moved later into a Ford Ikon car which also picked up the main shooter Nitin Nahar.After executing the crime, the men drove the Ikon to where the Fortuner was parked and fled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/main-gunman-in-sector-33-firing-arrested/story-4miIyykLmJCgZf1BagcaPJ.html
19-06-2020||Gurugram||State health department to conduct sero-survey to detect community transmission||To detect the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the city, the state health department has started conducting sero-survey by testing blood serum of a group of people from a community. Gurugram, with 4136 cases, so far had witnessed the highest number of cases in Haryana. The sero-survey, officials said, will help them detect the community transmission of the disease, if any.At least 450 people in the city will be covered under the survey. Along with Gurugram, four other affected districts — Faridabad, Ambala, Panchkula and Sonepat — will also be covered in the survey. Earlier, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had conducted the sero-suvey in 75 districts across the country and found that less than one percent of the population — 0.73% — in the non-containment zone had contracted the virus. “The sero-survey is being done in the state to estimate the proportion of population exposed to Covid-19 infection, including asymptomatic individuals. It is a process to check undetected community transmission. The survey will be conducted in the high-risk or vulnerable population zones, where people have been infected in the past and have now recovered and also those who tested negative for coronavirus,” said Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department.Community transmission of a disease happens when the source of infection can no longer be traced, leading to difficulty in containing it. Gurugram has currently breached the 4,000 mark in Covid-19 cases, and going by future projections, the number can reach up to 9,000 by the end of June. According to Arora, depending upon the seroprevalence of infection, the state can plan appropriate healthcare interventions.“The sero-survey includes IgG Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) test. For the survey, five millilitre blood samples will be collected. The sample will be put in a machine, which will separate blood and plasma. The plasma is then used to detect antibodies developed against coronavirus in the body. The IgG test is not useful for detecting acute infection but indicates episodes of Covid-19 infections in the past.”Studies show that the IgG antibodies start appearing after two weeks of the onset of infection. Even if the patient has recovered, antibodies last for several months. The IgG ELISA test is approved by the ICMR, for it has high sensitivity and specificity.The state has provided required kits to five districts. Since it is a survey, only limited number of kits have been provided. Ambala and Panchkula have got two kits each, while Faridabad, Gurugram and Sonipat has got five kits each. Each kit can test at least 90 samples, which can be tested together in a single run of two and a half hours.“At least 50% of the kit will be used on already confirmed positive patients, having history of confirmation in the last two weeks. The remaining will be used on those who were confirmed negative,” said Arora, adding that district -level team will collect 30 samples per day, maintaining rural-urban ratio. For the survey,samples will be collected from people having co-morbidity issues, from containment zones, health care workers, security and police personnel, rural population after reverse migration, labourers, farmers, staff in government agencies, among others, as per ICMR guidelines. The Haryana government has added few other sections of community — like pre-operative patients and pregnant women residing in containment zones who are likely to deliver in a week, and all elderly vulnerable population living in containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/state-health-department-to-conduct-sero-survey-to-detect-community-transmission/story-hGlfRaOwf42owNDHW3lzmJ.html
19-06-2020||City||Delhi government joins hands with civil society groups in fight against Covid-19||New Delhi: The Delhi government’s Information Technology department will set up a web portal where people who want to take part in the city’s Covid-19 management efforts can sign up, said senior officials on Friday, in a move aimed at simplifying the registration process for NGOs, civil society groups and individuals.The direction, issued by chief secretary Vijay Dev, is part of the Delhi government’s augmentation plan, which demands more people be roped in to take part in various aspects of the fight against the infectious disease in the coming days.The volunteers will be engaged in several tasks, including surveillance, managing patients under home isolation, working with government helplines, assisting senior citizens, and helping officials in makeshift Covid facilities being set up by the government, Dev said.The volunteers should be between 18 and 55 years of age, physically “fit” and free of Covid symptoms, read the order that HT has seen.“A volunteer’s fitness, in this case, will be determined through a basic screening process. It primarily means no co-morbid conditions,” a senior government official said.The official said preference should be given to people who have recovered from Covid, as a “confidence-building measure”.In the same order, the government also directed all district magistrates in Delhi to use the same web portal for registration of National Cadet Corps, Scouts, and National Service Scheme cadets for management work. The cadets shall be roped in for the same roles applicable to NGOs, civil society groups and individual volunteers, the order read.The order is based on directions between Union home minister Amit Shah, Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a meeting on Sunday, said the senior government official quoted above.Kejriwal had said last week that the Capital is likely to have around 550,000 cases of Covid-19 by July 31, and would need at least 80,000 beds ready. The government had started a health care infrastructure augmentation drive after the city started recording over 1,000 cases per day on an average May 28 onwards.The government is also likely to induct around 12,000 more civil defence volunteers — taking their strength to around 25,000 — by next week and use their services in the augmentation process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-government-joins-hands-with-civil-society-groups-in-fight-against-covid-19/story-l6O7N70N0tpZHravy9NSnK.html
19-06-2020||Gurugram||Home owners at housing project offer over 150 flats for isolating Covid-19 patients||The home owners of a delayed project in Gurugram sector 33 have proposed to the government to complete and use over 150 flats as isolation centres for treating Covid-19 patients. An association of homeowners in Unitech’s ‘The Residences’ said that in view of the increase in the number of Covid-19 patients in the city and need for such facilities, they were ready to offer flats located in the three towers of G Block. However, these flats are only 95 per cent complete and the pending work, which includes water, sewage and electricity connections and bathrooms, can be done jointly completed by the owners and the government, the association said. The project was launched in 2008 and was to be delivered in 2012. There are around 1300 flats in the entire project out of which 50 per cent are occupied, the association added. Suraj Singh, who represents the G block residents, had sent the proposal in this regard to chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday. The home buyers will share the cost of completing the necessary construction work. “We are ready to offer 156 such flats to the authorities to be used for treating Covid-19 patients. Our estimate is that 400 good quality rooms with attached facilities could be made available if the offer is accepted,” said Singh.The total amount needed to complete these flats is around ₹6 crore and the buyers are ready to contribute ₹1.56 crore, and six weeks later contribute ₹83 lakh more. “The 156 families of G Block in The Residences have also decided that we will not ask for possession of our homes this fiscal i.e till 31st March 2021 and that it can be used by the Government of Haryana till then,” the letter to the CM said. “The buyers of these flats are not residents of the project and these towers are separate and secluded, and there would be no problem for other residents,” he said. In January, the central government had offered to take over the company and complete the flat; this was accepted by the Supreme Court. Suraj Singh said that the offered flats could be made operational in a matter of a few weeks using the existing material and infrastructure. “It is also located near Subash Chowk and health care experts from top private hospitals that are nearby can come to treat patients. The stranded migrant labour in the city can also get livelihood in the project,” he added.To boost the number of beds available for quarantine of Covid-19 patients, the Gurugram administration last week had said that it was working out a plan with RWAs to set up quarantine facilities in condominiums and community centres wherever these are feasible. Ashok Sangwan, divisional commissioner, Gurugram, said on Friday that 400 isolation centres in city; urban and rural areas are being created to ensure adequate quarantine facilities are available to treat the patients. “At present we have 4500 hospital beds available for treatment of patients and the numbers are being increasd further,” he said. Despite repeated attempts, the district magistrate could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/home-owners-at-housing-project-offer-over-150-flats-for-isolating-covid-19-patients/story-9MtnoPxc2H5PLZVPEFiFLI.html
19-06-2020||Chandigarh||PSEB planning to allow Meritorious School students to appear in board exams from their home districts||The Punjab School Education Board is planning to allow students of Meritorious Schools to appear for the pending board exams in areas where they are residing. These students will be allotted exam centres at schools closest to where they reside by the board.Board officials have collected information from Meritorious Schools and Ludhiana Senior Secondary Residential School for Meritorious Students, according to which out of the 450 students of Class 12, 200 of them are from other districts.Over 50 students belong to Moga, 35 to Barnala, 23 each from Bathinda and Sangrur, 16 to Faridkot, 11 to Mukstar, 10 from Fazilka, 9 from Jalandhar, six from Mansa, four each from SBS Nagar and Ferozepur, two each from Patiala, Rupnagar and Fatehgarh Sahib and one each from Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala and Pathankot. There are 10 Meritorious Schools across Punjab and majority of the students studying in these schools belong to other districts.Board officials have sought information from Meritorious Schools regarding students from other districts so that a decision can be taken on allowing them to appear for the exams in their own district. With the number of Covid-19 cases surging in the state over the last 10 days, it will be risky for the students to move from one district to another. The board is yet to declare the date sheet for the Class 12 board exams that are expected to be held in July. The board has recently gathered information regarding the number of containment zones and exam centres converted to quarantine centers from the district education officers. Janak Raj Mehrok, the board’s examination controller, said, “We have sought information from Meritorious Schools and are trying to adjust students in exam centres near their homes in their district. We have received details and are in the process of taking a decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pseb-planning-to-allow-meritorious-school-students-to-appear-in-board-exams-from-their-home-districts/story-PPgobTxAdHIEP02iEl9xHI.html
19-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi University admission process begins online from Saturday||The registration process for admissions to Delhi University’s various undergraduate, postgraduate, Mphil, and PhD courses is set to begin on Saturday. Applicants can visit the university’s registration portal on Saturday and register for the courses.Last year, the online registration process took place between May 30 and June 22 and the first cut-off was announced on June 28. The admission process has been delayed this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“The registration portal will open on Saturday and applicants can register till July 4. Students will be given a second chance to update their marks once the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announces its results,” a member of the admission committee said, requesting anonymity.Due to the Covid-19 crisis, CBSE had rescheduled all its remaining Class 12 exams. The exams of 12 major subjects are now scheduled to take place between July 1 and 15. However, while hearing a plea, the Supreme Court on Wednesday has asked the board to consider alternatives like marking students based on internal assessments instead of exams during the pandemic.“We are not sure about the cut-off date since we don’t know when CBSE results will be declared. As per the tentative plans, students will get about 10 days to enter their marks following CBSE results. The first cut-off will be released a week later,” a DU official said, requesting anonymity.This year, the admission process will be carried out completely online. Instead of the Open Day events held every year to clarify doubts at the campus, the admission committee will conduct online sessions for applicants with queries. Several other measures have been put in place to ensure that admissions are conducted smoothly.Manoj Sinha, the principal of Aryabhatta College and secretary of DU Principals’ Association, said, “While discussing this year’s admission policies with principals, the admission committee informed us that there will be no percentage deduction when students are changing their streams in undergraduate courses.”Earlier, students willing to change streams during the undergraduate courses had to undergo a percentage deduction which varied across colleges. This year, colleges won’t have any additional criteria for admission such as interviews for different courses.But Delhi University is yet to announce this change. Officials privy to the development said DU may announce it in its admission bulletin on Saturday. Trials for sports and extracurricular activities (ECA) won’t be conducted this year due to Covid-19 crisis. Admissions to sports candidates across 27 disciplines will be granted entirely based on their certificates.

He said the information he received varied with respect to the orphan children.The plea also referred to three-four cases wherein children who lost their parents and were living with grandparents and depended on them. The petition contended that a child with six siblings, whose parents died, had applied to the Social Welfare Department which told him that the department only provides old-age pension, disability pension and financial assistance (Delhi Family Benefit Scheme).“In such cases, grandparents or other relatives who are residing with/ taking care of those children face great difficulty to maintain or educate the children due to non-availability of funds,” it said.“It is surprising that respondents (authorities) are providing pensions to old citizens and widows but they have no schemes and projects for these children who have lost their parents and are unable/ incapable to earn their livelihood,” the plea read.The matter will be now be heard on July 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-seeks-govt-response-on-plea-seeking-schemes-for-orphans/story-jpm1KjFUEk3CqKeHdknMyH.html
19-06-2020||Chandigarh||FICO opposes finance ministry’s proposal to decriminalise cheque bounce offences||The Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO) has opposed the finance ministry’s proposal to decriminalise cheque bounce offences.The members rued that significant portion of business, whether retail or bulk, is being carried out through cheques and if the offence is decriminalised, there would be no fear in minds of offenders. FICO president Gurmeet Singh Kular said,“There seems to be no rationale in the proposed amendments and this will lead to chaos in settlement of financial deals, both personal and business. The decriminaliation of economic offences, especially cases of cheque bounce, will adversely affect working of business entities dealing on credit or postdated cheque basis. This move will certainly prove counterproductive as a potent and expeditious mechanism for recovery of loans through penal consequences.”General secretary Rajeev Jain said, “The provision was incorporated in the Negotiable Instrument Act, with the objective to defeat the criminal objectives of the persons, who intend to swallow the hard-earned money of the investors and entrepreneurs. Promoting efficiency in banking operations and ensuring credibility in transacting business through cheques was the intention reason behind making cheque bounce a non-bailable offence. Judicial interpretations followed from time to time and it was repeatedly held in various judicial pronouncements that Section 138 was meant to protect bona fide creditors against unscrupulous drawers who never intended to honour the cheques issued by them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fico-opposes-finance-ministry-s-proposal-to-decriminalise-cheque-bounce-offences/story-zbpYMDKwdCnvmr9197ZvNL.html

19-06-2020||City||Nine deaths by suicide in two days in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad||PUNE: Nine deaths by suicide were reported in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas in two days, police said on Friday. Some of the deaths, police said, are related to financial distress caused by the economic disruption during the Covid-19 lockdown.In Pune, four members of a family were found dead in their flat on Friday morning in the Bharti Vidyapeeth police station jurisdiction, according to Pune police, who said they found a suicide note from the apartment stating, “Nobody should be blamed for our deaths.”The four members of the family include a man and his wife in their 30s, and their two children. It is possible that the parents killed the children first before dying by suicide, police said.Deputy commissioner of police Shirish Sardeshpande said preliminary reports suggest the family was in financial distress caused by the Covid-19-induced lockdown.In a separate case, a 45-year-old businessman from Sinhgad died by suicide on Thursday. He was found in his apartment by his brother, who rushed him to the hospital, but was declared dead on arrival.In Wakad, a 32-year-old IT professional was found dead in his apartment on Thursday afternoon. The police said it could be a case of suicide, as a note was found in the house. “The note was not addressed to anyone. It said nobody was to be blamed for the step that he was taking,” said Wakad station house officer Ravindra Mudol. This was the second incident in Wakad where another man, aged 40, killed himself on Friday.In a third incident in Wakad, a 40-year-old man was found dead in his house, in a case of apparent death by suicide. He lived alone, police said.“Each person who has ended their life may have his or her own reason. There’s of course an impact of overall current atmosphere on everyone, while at the same time many of those who end lives may have depression, although it may not necessarily be the cause,” said Dr Soumitra Pathare, psychiatrist and director, Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy, Indian Law Society (ILS).On Friday evening, a Chinchwad man (30) who worked as a contract employee in a private firm was found dead in his house. “He was recently married, but his wife was at her parents’ place out of the city when the incident took place,” police said. Another man (30) from Pimple-Gurav died by suicide on Friday. He was single and lived with his mother, police said.Government counsellor Vaishali Ranade said, “There are a number of reasons behind the increase in such incidents. Job losses in the Covid crisis have created economic insecurity and anxiety, and this is compounded by a lack of communication. Also, we notice that young people have put wealth at the centre of their existence. We will have to learn to decide our limitations and face challenges with what we have got.”Wakad police counsel man away from drastic step The Wakad police have been applauded for their efforts in weaning away a 30-year-old person who was going to attempt suicide on Friday.According to information released by the Pimpri-Chinchwad police commissionerate, “The victim called the PCMC police and expressed his desire to commit suicide, citing the reason behind his decision.”The Wakad police realised the seriousness of the situation, sent a patrol team to the location and counselled him after which the man decided to opt away from his drastic decision, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nine-deaths-by-suicide-in-two-days-in-pune-and-pimpri-chinchwad/story-3T84U2QOS6BTnSARiurQCN.html
19-06-2020||Chandigarh||Vendors at Ludhiana railway station out of work due to limited trains, low footfall of passengers||Rail services were partially restored 19 days ago, but over 75 vendors are still without work due to low footfall of passengers at the railway station here. Vendors said, earlier, around 150 to 200 trains used to traverse from Ludhiana with a footfall of around 80,000 passengers daily and they were able to earn their living by selling eatables. But, now there are very few passengers and many of them do not want to buy or eat from the stalls anything due to coronavirus scare.A visit to the railway station revealed that all the stalls and trolleys provided at platform numbers from 1 to 7 are closed and not operational.It was found that most vendors hailed from Himachal Pradesh and they went back to their hometowns when lockdown was imposed.Those belonging to Ludhiana have returned to run their stalls and trolleys, but with only 9 pairs of trains passing the station daily, they do not have enough customers.A majority of the stalls and moving trolleys sell food items such as ‘chhole kulche’, chips, cold drinks, biscuits, water bottles, etc to passengers at the station. Secretary of the Vendors’ Cooperative Society Ram Swaroop said, “After the Railways suspended train services in March due to lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus, all vendors lost their source of income and have been without work since then.” He said, “There are many vendors, who are above 55, and working at the station for the past 25 to 30 years here, but, with the changed situation due to Covid-19, it may not be possible for them to get back to work.”Suresh Kumar, a 41-year-old vendor, said, “I want to get back to work but, as the number of corona cases has been on the rise, my family is not allowing me to do so. I have exhausted all my savings during the last three months and now I depend on the NGO, which is providing one-time meal to the poor. The Railways must resume train services so that vendors are able to earn their living.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/vendors-at-ludhiana-railway-station-out-of-work-due-to-limited-trains-low-footfall-of-passengers/story-k40U5zsWrb4vRyKSW81xZO.html
19-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Covid-19 positivity rate highest in tricity, Mohali, P’kula carry out more tests||Even though Chandigarh has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the tricity, its testing fewer people than those in Mohali and Panchkula districts, because of which its test positivity rate is the highest in the tricity.Positivity rates are determined by dividing the number of tests conducted by the number of cases testing positive. Chandigarh, with a Covid-19 count of 381, has conducted 6,438 tests so far with a test positivity rate of 6%. This percentage is much higher than that of Mohali (1.9%) where 10,467 individuals have been tested and 208 found infected.Panchkula follows Mohali with 7,615 tests, of which 124 have tested positive but only 79 are from the district and the positivity rate is 1%.Defending their numbers, health authorities in Chandigarh claim their screening processes are very effective and have helped them successfully detect and sample suspected cases.On the high positivity rates, Dr KK Talwar, former director, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), says one of the reasons for the higher numbers could be testing of high-risk persons and contacts in cluster areas, especially during the outbreak at Bapu Dham Colony.Intensive screening in high-risk areas“A number of reasons could be involved, including concentrated testing. So as you test more high-risk people the test positivity rate is bound to increase,” he added. Indranil Banerjee, an expert in infectious diseases caused by emerging human pathogenic viruses at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali, said the numbers indicated that more infections had come to the fore in Chandigarh as cluster areas emerged. “So when you test more people in those areas the positivity rate will increase. But, these numbers are volatile and can go up if a hotspot emerges and the number of infected people grows.” A community health expert at PGIMER, wishing to remain anonymous, suggested that as asymptomatic people at Bapu Dham Colony, were not currently being tested, the test positivity rates could come down. ‘Rates could come down soon’“Chandigarh has been following Central government guidelines religiously which do not include testing of asymptomatic patients with no contacts. At the same time, we have a larger population in slums, which have been the hotbed of infection. Also, Chandigarh is a major transit point. Larger population movement leads to greater transmission,” he added.Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh, said that right from day one the focus was on testing as many persons as possible who fit in the criteria.“I had given orders for testing people even with the slightest of the symptoms, which actually helps in isolating the infected persons and thus spread the infection. Contacts are aggressively traced and mandatorily tested. This has kept our infection spread low and the recent spike is due to the movement of people from hotspots outside the state,” he added.When questioned about the high positivity rate, the UT director, health services, Dr G Dewan, said, “ I can put it this way that our strategy is very good wherein we are able to detect the suspects during screening and only they are taken up for sampling. Their turning out positive only corroborates the fact that our screening is good.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-covid-19-positivity-rate-highest-in-tricity-mohali-p-kula-carry-out-more-tests/story-oGEnULHe0gKzSxX4qg6mIM.html
19-06-2020||Noida||Noida district puts SDMs, city magistrates in driver’s seat to control Covid-19||In a bid to control the rapid increase in the number of cases of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease in the district, the Gautam Budh Nagar administration has decentralised the decision-making process and has put all incident commanders in the driver’s seat for handling all Covid-19 related efforts in their zones.The sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) and city magistrates in each of the five zones in the district—Noida, Dadri, Greater Noida, Sadar, and Jewar—have been given the power to take decisions on measures to contain the pandemic and will be responsible for reducing the number of Covid-19 cases in areas under their jurisdictions.Earlier the key decisions were being made by district magistrate, chief medical officer, and surveillance officer, regarding containment zones, screening of people, and other issues, while SDMs and city magistrates were responsible for implementing the same on the ground.“Now we have made SDMs and city magistrates as head of their respective zones. They can take prompt decisions and work according to the situation in their respective areas. Now, the health team that used to report to the CMO will work in tandem with the SDM or the city magistrate. This is to take some workload off the CMO and to take quick decisions on the ground. Our motive is to reduce the rapid rise in the positive cases,” said Narendra Bhooshan, senior IAS officer, who is the nodal officer for the Gautam Budh Nagar district.The district has 1,262 Covid-19 cases so far. There are nearly 240 containment zones. including 140 category 1 containment zones and 100 category 2 containment zones in the district so far, said officials. Areas in containment zone category 1 have one positive case and a radius of around 250 metres, while category 2 containment zones have more than one positive case and is spread over around a 500m radius.The SDMs and city magistrates will now have to focus on contact tracing and door-to-door screening of patients in their areas. “Each SDM and city magistrate now needs to engage themselves in conducting contact tracing and door-to-door screening of patients. There are 600 teams for five zones for the purpose, and each team has at least two health care workers. These teams will screen residents door-to-door to identify those who may be infected so that the suspected Covid-19 patients can get treatment without any delay,” said Bhooshan. Every district in UP has a senior IAS officer appointed as a nodal officer to look after Covid-19 efforts and work effectively to contain the virus. In the neighbouring district of Ghaziabad, district magistrate (DM) Ajay Shankar Pandey has directed the health department to set up helpdesks at different areas across the city to screen people for Covid-19.The help desk will be set up at primary health centres, government hospitals, municipal commissioner office, district magistrate office, all zonal offices of Ghaziabad municipal corporation, and all municipal councils of the Ghaziabad district and other offices.“People will be screened at the help desk and those who need it will be provided immediate medical help. Anyone can reach the desk and get themselves screened. Health workers will also provide important information on Covid-19,” said Pandey. The move to set up help desks in the city is to identify infected patients quickly so that the appropriate decisions to contain the spread can be taken immediately, said, officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-puts-sdms-in-driver-s-seat-to-take-covid-19-control-measures/story-1UzDosJ1fXeyCbhUayvTHO.html
19-06-2020||City||Noida: Three-point plan to contain Covid-19 spread and reduce death rate||NOIDA: To deal with the spurt in Covid-19 cases in Gautam Budh Nagar, the district health department has been asked to implement a three-pronged strategy -- early detection of infection, better treatment and immediate testing of a non-Covid patient admitted in any hospital, said Narendra Bhooshan, the chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority, who is the nodal officer for the district to combat the infection. The district had 1,262 Covid-19 patients till June 19, while 18 people died due to the infection. After the resumption of economic activities and opening up of public places, the administration is facing a challenge to prevent the rapid spread of the infection. Till June 3, there were 496 positive cases in the district. However, 766 new cases have been reported between June 3 and June 19, said the officials. The three-point plan is the key to reduce the mortality rate and also flatten the rising curve, Bhooshan said.“Recently, two deaths took place due to late detection of the Covid-19 infection. To make sure it does not happen in future, we have directed all hospitals, be it government or private, that first conduct Covid-19 test of a patient who comes for treatment,” said Bhooshan. To identify positive patients at initial stage of infection, mass screening needs to be done, Bhooshan said, adding that for better treatment, doctors are told to closely monitor the health of each patient and promptly provide oxygen if need arises. “We want to follow state government guidelines strictly to prevent the spread of disease. We have directed the health staff to identify the Covid-19 patients at the early stage so that the treatment starts immediately. If any hospital, be it private or government, fails to follow instructions and does not conduct test on the day of admission, then we will take legal action against such hospital,” said Bhooshan.On Friday, Bhooshan also conducted inspection in Sector 134, Shahpur and Govardhan villages, which are containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-three-point-plan-to-contain-covid-19-spread-and-reduce-death-rate/story-14hpqpk2f0dJxzHiobYlMJ.html

Power department officials said the power demand is going to increase further in the coming days as humidity levels rise ahead of the monsoon season.The peak demand soared to 6,193 MW at 10.43 pm on Thursday and the previous high of the season was 5,895 MW on Wednesday, said power department officials.On Thursday, in some pockets of the city, the temperature soared to 46 degree Celsius. IMD forecast said there will be some relief from Saturday when light showers are expected before the monsoon hits the city from June 22.“In just 24 hours, Delhi’s peak power demand has increased by over 3%,” said a spokesperson of BSES discom. The BSES discoms BRPL and BYPL successfully met the peak power demand, he said.Last year, Delhi’s peak power demand clocked 7,409 MW in July. This year Delhi’s peak power demand is expected to cross 7,500 MW-mark.Delhi’s peak power demand has increased by around 50% since easing of lockdown restrictions on May 18.

19-06-2020||Chandigarh||IAS officers’ ACR taken out of mayors’ purview in Punjab civic bodies||After notifying Civil Services Board providing for fixed tenure to Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officers, a move that did not go down well with the ruling party leaders, the Punjab government has now taken the annual confidential report (ACR) of IAS officers appointed as municipal commissioners out of the purview of mayors of civic bodies in the state. Punjab has 13 municipal corporations (MCs), with those in Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Amritsar and Patiala always having an IAS officer as the commissioner. An ACR is a confidential report, accessing the performance, character, conduct and qualities of the member of service, and helps in their career advancement.With the June 10 notification of the personnel department, undersigned by chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh, the post of mayor has been reduced to a mere rubber stamp, as all executive powers are already vested with the commissioner. The mayor only presides over meetings of the MC General House. Not only this, now instead of the local bodies minister, the chief minister is the final accepting authority of the ACR. Navjot Singh Sidhu, as the local bodies minister, had remained at loggerheads with municipal commissioners and had even recommended strict action against three IAS officers. According to the notification, now the administrative secretary of local bodies will be the reporting authority and will write the ACR, while the minister will be the reviewing authority and the chief minister the accepting authority. IAS officers had been lobbying for these changes to ACR rules for quiet some time.Former local bodies minister late Kewal Krishan, in a bid to give more powers to elected representatives, had allowed president of civic bodies to write the ACR of executive officers besides countersigning cheque books for withdrawal. Later, when the Punjab Municipal Corporation Act was framed, the power was given to mayors, giving them control over bureaucratic setup of the civic body.“After the fresh orders, the mayor is nothing more than a rubber stamp,” said Ajitpal Singh Kohli, a Shiromani Akali Dal leader who remained the Patiala mayor from 2013 to 2018. “The mayor is an elected representative and accountable to the public, which is why they were given the power to judge the working and write ACR of commissioners. Now, the commissioner has no accountability towards the mayor or political setup. Already all executive and financial powers are vested with the commissioner.”Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president Sunil Jakhar said the matter has not come to his notice yet. “Already MLAs and party workers have approached me over the fixed tenure of IAS officers. This is a similar issue. I will convey sentiments of workers to the CM,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ias-officers-acr-taken-out-of-mayors-purview-in-punjab-civic-bodies/story-EcO6s3E6ZR7cKCkdvwQdxO.html

We created informal self-help groups, who supplied fresh produce to resident welfare associations in cities and towns,” said Shailendra Kaur, director horticulture.Most farmers who were benefited have set up poly-house and shade net house and are engaged in plucking, grading, sorting, making packets and taking produce to consumers’ doorsteps. By May end, 16,500 tonne vegetables and fruits have been sold and some groups are getting bulk orders from outside Punjab.“We are replicating the model across state and have started converting these informal groups to farmer producer organisations so that they can be self-reliant,” said Kaur.Gurpreet Singh Shergill, a farmer from Majhal village in Patiala, who has formed farmers’ group ‘Dynamic Diversified Farmers, said the model hhas shown good results.“We have 13 farmers in our group who have 200 acre to grow vegetables on.

The staff deployed at the Pink stations also consisted only of women except security personnel,” she said.“The ‘She-Man’ station will cater especially to the transgender community, though it will be open for all passengers, and will give facilities to facilitate the travel of the trans community in the metro system and also provide employment opportunities for them,” the NMRC MD added.She said structural changes in terms of change in restroom infrastructure and creation of a separate security check for the community are also being considered at sector 50 station.In a statement, the NMRC said it will also be generating awareness about the community among its other commuters through signages at its stations and announcements inside the trains and stations. “The NMRC staff will also be sensitised and trained to communicate with the transgender community in a sensitive and cordial manner,” it said.The NMRC said it also plans to include members of the transgender community into its system by engaging their services in various aspects of the functioning of its system, like ticket counters and other areas through deployed contractors. “Transgenders will be provided proper training, like other NMRC employees, before being inducted into the NMRC system,” it added.  The NMRC has also interacted with various NGOs who work closely with the community to understand their challenges and struggles and devise an effective method for an inclusive society, according to the statement. The NMRC said it has “always been sensitive” towards the needs of “all its commuters” who come from various walks of life and has made constant endeavours to provide a safe and comfortable travelling experience to all its commuters.“Transgenders form a major chunk of the commuters that use the metro system to travel. This step by the NMRC will make the travelling experience for this community more enriching,” it said.Also known as the ‘Aqua Line’, the Noida-Greater Noida Metro, which started functioning in January 2019, runs between the eponymous twin-cities of Gautam Buddh Nagar covering nearly 30 km over 21 stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-metro-to-have-she-man-station-for-transgenders/story-y7KGmUlZN6sd8DZ0Oe3TXM.html

19-06-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana gave Rs 50L aid, job to 300 kin of fallen soldiers in 6 yrs||Even as the ex gratia grants given to the next of kin of fallen soldiers differ significantly from one state to another, Haryana has been kind in supporting families of those killed in action generously. The state government gives Rs 50 lakh ex gratia grant to the bravehearts of the armed and paramilitary forces besides government jobs to their kin. As per the official records, ever since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in Haryana in October 2014, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP government has given jobs to nearly 300 dependents of slain soldiers on compassionate grounds. Haryana has at least three lakh ex-servicemen and their dependents’ number is about 8.75 lakh. According to Raja Sekhar Vundru, principal secretary (sainik and ardh sainik welfare department), every tenth soldier of the Indian Army is from Haryana. “Haryana is probably one of the few states where Rs 50 lakh is given as ex gratia relief to next of kin of the martyrs,” Vundru said.The state government offers Class-2 posts to the dependents of Haryana-origin Class-1 and Class-2 rank officers of the armed and paramilitary forces killed in action. Earlier, the government had been rehabilitating their kin with Class-3 and Class-4 posts under a 2014 policy. The Haryana government had in March 2017 increased the compensation (Rs 50 lakh) with retrospective effect (1.11.2016) even to the family members of the central paramilitary forces’ personnel who die in war or action against terrorists. The government had widened the scope of payment of ex gratia by including contingencies such as death during internal security duty, operations, election duty, duties during natural calamities and rescue operations. The government also gives to all eligible soldiers Rs 35 lakh each in case of 75% disability sustained during war or action against terrorists; Rs 25 lakh if the disability is 50% to 74% and Rs 15 lakh if the disability is between 25% and 49%. This financial aid is given to the soldiers who were residents of Haryana at the time of joining the service, the March 6, 2017 notification says. Haryana also gives Rs 30 lakh aid to family of police personnel who die in the line of duty. The official said after bringing the ex gratia for kin of paramilitary personnel killed in action on a par with the army, the power to sanction Rs 50 lakh relief has been delegated to the deputy commissioners so that there is no delay in transit of documents from district office to headquarters and vice versa. “It was done in view of defence and paramilitary authorities taking some time to issue necessary documentation in cases of death due to enemy action, terrorist encounters and IED blasts,” another official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-gave-rs-50l-aid-job-to-300-kin-of-fallen-soldiers-in-6-yrs/story-4kr7LjsSAOgyycTEFNJFJK.html

Pannu talks about Khalistan.”“Satnam who was killed by Chinese troops, was an ‘amritdhari’. His wife, son and father are also ‘amritdharis’,” he said.“Pannu should be ashamed of supporting China. The entire country should condemn this and Pannu’s family should be boycotted wherever they reside in country,” the Congress minister said.“Pannu is propagating Khalistan just to gather money from Pakistan, ISI, China and other anti-national forces. He should be brought to India and punished,” added Randhawa.‘OPPOSE AKAL TAKHT JATHEDAR’S REMARK ON KHALISTAN’Responding to a query on acting Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh’s statement favouring Khalistan, the minister said that he is against the statement.“I am also an amritdhari Sikh. But I don’t want Khalistan. We pray and demand for khule darshan of Guru Nanak’s birth place Nankana Sahib which had gone to Pakistan. Will you pray for darshan of Gurdwara Paunta Singh, Takht Sri Patna Sahib, Takht Sri Hazoor Sahib or Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib which fall outside Punjab tomorrow? Such a thing is not a demand of any Sikh or Punjabi,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pannu-is-a-traitor-his-family-should-be-boycotted-randhawa/story-mDntU2eC9XjqWxFGHdSE1L.html

Another male, a 22-year-old from Nawada town died at the Patna Medical College Hospital late Thursday evening.“The 58-year-old Saran resident had a travel history of Delhi and showed symptoms of breathlessness,” said Dr Mukul Kumar Singh, nodal officer of coronavirus at the NMCH.“His son and he had come to our facility directly from the railway station after getting down from a Shramik Special train on June 17. He did not have fever or cough, but was uneasy and complained of breathlessness. He tested positive for the virus the same day. His condition, however, deteriorated rapidly and he died today,” Dr Singh added.However, health officials were perplexed over the death of the 22-year-old from Nawada, as he neither had a travel history nor did he claim to have come in contact with any Covid-19 patients, said officials.“Four people have tested positive on the TrueNat machine as part of the contact tracing of the victim. It is quite possible that the victim himself had come in contact with an unsuspecting Covid-19 positive patient in his family or his close acquaintance. We are trying to ascertain the infection trail,” said Nawada civil surgeon Dr Wimal Prasad Singh.The government, in its customary media briefing Friday evening, reported five deaths, including two from Darbhanga and one from Nalanda, besides one each from Nawada and Saran.That was because the health department, which disseminates Covid-19 information to the public through its Twitter handle @BiharHealthDept, did not update the death toll on Thursday evening even though it had updated information about rise in the number of positive cases. Three of the five deaths, the government announced Friday, were reported around 5pm on Thursday itself.Meanwhile, the recovery rate of patients has gone up to 71% in Bihar, said Bihar health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh during the media briefing on Friday.“Of the total 7,178 Covid-19 cases in the state so far, 5,098 had recovered, including 137 who were discharged from different health facilities during the last 24 hours,” he added.Bihar had tested a maximum of 5,978 samples on Thursday, taking the total number of tests to 1,45,562 so far, said Singh.He further said that 4,736 migrant workers, who returned to the state after May 3, had tested positive for the virus. This meant that 66% of the total Covid-19 cases in the state were attributed to the migrants. The percentage was as high as 72% till recently.Though the number of migrant workers coming to the state has gone down, 18 more Shramik Special trains were expected to reach the state from different parts of the country by June 22, said Anupam Kumar, secretary, information and public relations department, Bihar.Earlier in the day, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar inspected the Covid-19 isolation centre at the Patliputra Sports Complex at Kankerbagh and gave necessary instructions to officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/with-138-new-covid-19-cases-bihar-s-count-rises-to-7-178-death-toll-at-49/story-9uLwaIzdLgxJe3JXum0mQP.html

Chandigarh Renewal Energy and Science and Technology Promotion Society (Crest) is currently tendering this and 2,200 systems will be given as a pilot project on a first come first serve basis soon.Under the Resco model, residents won’t have to spend a single penny on setting up the SPV power plant. The SPV plant will be installed by a private company. Residents will only give permission to set up the plant on their property. The maintenance of the equipment will be done by the private company, while extra power generated by the plant against the power used will be paid to the company. After a period of about 15 years which will be decided through e-tender, the ownership of the plant will be transferred to the resident without any extra payment.The beneficiaries will get the solar power at a fixed tariff of ₹3.44 per unit until the project transfer period. In comparison currently, residents pay ₹2.75 per unit for the first 150 units, ₹4.80 per unit till 400 units, and ₹5.20 per unit if the consumption crosses 400 units. Crest officials said as per calculations an average consumer will end up saving between ₹1-2 per unit. Residents having a connected load of 5kWp and more irrespective of their plot size will be eligible for this. As a pilot project, 2,200 systems will be installed on a first come first serve basis. The project will be installed equally to the connected load maximum of up to 10kWp.Chief executive officer of Crest, Debendra Dalai said, “The department will soon launch a website for those interested after the tendering is done. The number of years before the residents own the SPV plant will be variable, but it is expected to be around 15 years,” he said adding that solar panels on the roof will also help keep the top floor cool during the summers.All plots above 500 sq yards mandatorily have to get SPV power plants, the last date of which had been extended to March 31, 2021, with no further extensions. This scheme will benefit such plot owners who don’t want to spend lakhs on this system however those with plots smaller than 500 sq. yards can also apply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ut-approves-installation-of-solar-plants-under-resco-model/story-Lj5tAiVpzKaJ2VMqjFe3fO.html

It’s time to call their bluff, he said, reiterating that Indians want a befitting response to be the Chinese.Questioning the so-called agreement which prevented the Indian troops from firing, Amarinder demanded to know who had come up with such an agreement. “How can one have an agreement of this nature with a hostile neighbour?” he asked.“It is clear that the attack on Indian soldiers was a pre-meditated move by the Chinese, who had come prepared with deadly weapons,” he said, adding, “by carrying nail-studded lathis and barbed-wired clubs and by attacking our troops, they abrogated whatever agreement was in place. In such circumstance, the Indian soldiers had full right to retaliate using weapons.”“If the situation is allowed to escalate, China, in collusion with Pakistan, will get further emboldened to encroach upon Indian territories,” Captain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/issue-ultimatum-to-beijing-to-vacate-galwan-valley-punjab-cm-to-centre/story-OBu8HkqnMCbEExFO9KXugL.html

Rana was arrested on the court premises as soon as his bail plea was rejected.He has been taken to Solan for interrogation, said additional superintendent of police Shiv Kumar. This is the fourth arrest in the case. Last week, the SIT had arrested KK Singh, former registrar of the university. Two university officials—registrar Anupama Thakur and assistant registrar Munish Goel—were arrested in March. Rana’s arrest was delayed due to the Covid-19 outbreak. He, however, had sent his son and wife abroad on March 7 soon after the case was registered.The fake degree scam, which was unearthed in February this year, after the University Grants Commission (UGC) received an anonymous complaint, involves the alleged sale of more than five lakh degrees by two private universities in Himachal, including MBU, Solan and APG University, Shimla. The UGC had informed the state government about the alleged sale of fake degrees by the two universities seeking an appropriate action. A case under sections 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code was registered against the university officials for cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy on March 3. The investigation revealed that MBU had issued several fake degrees to students. It also revealed that Rana and his family also possessed fake degrees. Since then, cases have been filed against MBU at various places, including Datia in Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Lucknow, Bilaspur and Pune.According to police sources, the SIT has also written to various bar councils and institutions of the country informing them about fake degrees issued to several people, many of whom may have obtained jobs in government and private sector on the basis of these degrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fake-degree-scam-manav-bharti-varsity-chairman-arrested-after-himachal-hc-rejects-anticipatory-bail-plea/story-fxONi80xxEMvlNjpquuPOK.html

The revised test rates came into force with immediate effect. The private labs had been charging Rs 4,500 for the said test.“In exercise of the powers under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the state government directs that no private laboratory should charge any amount more than Rs 2,400 for the RT-PCR test for Covid-19, including taxes, cost involved in pick up, packing and transportation of samples, documentation and reporting,” the order reads.Arora said there were 12 government and seven private laboratories which were approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for testing the samples for detection of the virus. ICMR had in March capped the single test charges by private labs at Rs 4,500.However, since RT-PCR testing kits are now being manufactured in India and are readily available, the medical research body asked the state to negotiate and fix mutually agreeable price for the test.As per the advice of experts, including recommendations of the committee under Dr VK Paul, member, NITI Aayog, and taking into account the cost of kits and consumables, the state government on Friday ordered a downward price revision for the test.Arora said all testing protocols as laid down by ICMR and the central government will have to be followed by the private laboratories.“The private labs will share the data pertaining to the tests results with state government and ICMR on real-time basis. At the time of sampling, the identification, address and verified mobile number of the person, who is being tested, must be noted for record as per the sample referral form. The data should be uploaded on the RT-PCR app at the time of taking the sample. The test report should be communicated to the patient immediately after the testing is complete,” the order mentioned.Arora said a positive test report should be immediately communicated to the civil surgeon of the district concerned through e-mail.“The private laboratories have been instructed to maintain utmost confidentiality about the patient’s details. These labs have also been ordered to preserve the RT-PCR machine generated data and graphs for future verification by the state government,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-govt-caps-covid-19-test-price-at-rs-2-400/story-u3tMWnldeVSofYfAGHgh6K.html

To mark the day and engage more people, government authorities and different yoga associations have opted for virtual yoga.Since the United Nations passed a resolution to celebrate June 21 every year as International Yoga Day, there has been a manifold increase in the number of yoga enthusiasts. Covid-19, however, has driven people to include breathing exercises in their daily lifestyle to boost the immune system to fight the pandemic. Yoga has turned out to be one of favourite fitness regimens during the lockdown.ONLINE CLASSES AND SESSIONS“Though this time we won’t have any mass gathering to celebrate International Yoga Day, the count of people doing yoga on a regular basis has increased as compared to pre-Covid times. Many of our passouts, who are professional yoga instructors, are already taking online yoga classes on a daily basis and they will do it on Sunday too to celebrate the day,” says yoga expert Kulwant Singh, who is working as an instructor at Government College of Yoga Education and Health, Sector 23, Chandigarh.“Every year, we used to hold a yoga camp in the college premises that would culminate with the Yoga Day celebrations on June 21. But this time, because of Covid-19 and keeping social distancing in mind, we started an online camp from June 13. Both morning and evening sessions are held live on the college’s Facebook page and YouTube channel and we are getting a decent response. For June 21, we will be having a special session in which six of our college’s yoga instructors will be going live online,” says yoga college principal Sapna Nanda. “Our institute in collaboration with yoga scholars of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) organised a webinar on ‘Relevance of yoga in present day scenario’ in the run-up to yoga day celebrations today.”YOGA FINDS NEW FOLLOWERSWith gyms and other fitness centres closed to check the spread of Covid-19, more people are opting for yoga that has seen many new entrants in the last three months.“We will be having special online yoga sessions spread across the first-half of the day to mark International Yoga Day on Sunday. Yoga institutes from six countries, including India, Australia, Japan, and Malaysia, will be joining us,” says Indian-origin yoga guru based in Australia, Rajendra Damodara Yenkannamoole, whose organisation Vasudeva Kriya Yoga runs 17 centres in Melbourne and one in Bengaluru.“We will be having sessions on yoga as therapy, yoga for health, yoga for mobility and strength,” said the yoga guru, who has a YouTube channel and website vasudevakriyayoga.com.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/international-yoga-day-goes-virtual-in-covid-19-times-it-s-yoga-at-home-with-family-this-year/story-iDyAldrysmyomaoOs8hVVP.html
19-06-2020||Chandigarh||‘Panjab University’s survival mantra: Keep politics out, encourage research’||Ranking designed to encourage privatisationRanking of educational institutions is perception management and a statistically futile exercise. Inconsistent, arbitrary in nature, these rankings compare apples with oranges. This fraudulent perception (or deception) management exercise is designed to put educational institutions in market-driven ‘competitive’ mode based on monetary incentives. Low ranking means less funding. Outcomes translated into quantitative numbers decide the rankings. But education, particularly social sciences, are not quantitative and yield instant results. It’s a simple thing our “academicians” don’t want us to understand. To put it bluntly, this ranking exercise is essentially designed to encourage privatisation and commercialisation of education under parasitic neoliberal policies. Better ranking would essentially mean how aggressively these “top” institutions initiated self finance courses by depriving marginalised sections.Sandeep Kumar, Chandigarh Less politics, more academicsPanjab University (PU) has a long history of quality education, good faculty, vast research, highly accomplished alumni in all walks of life, and an international appeal. But over the last few years, the university’s performance is slipping due to lack of funds. Neither the Centre nor Punjab are helping support it financially. The vice-chancellor (V-C) also has to be an educationist and not a man with political party affiliations. As a member of the PU Alumni Association, I feel the university deserves better. Apart from raising the bar of quality education , the campus environment needs to be improved with more focus and academics and less on politics. PU can only beat high ranking universities by improving its teaching, international outlook, and research output. Colonel R D Singh ( retd), Ambala CanttGo digital firstPU should go digital first and ensure its important activities, seminars etc take place online. Facilities, including classrooms should be improved, and the canteens and cafes given a makeover. Academics and not politics should become the focus of the university. All decisions that are taken should have the consent of the students first to give them a say in university matters. Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhCertain groups must stop ruling PU ‘by proxy’PU, once the pride of undivided Punjab, enjoyed international fame. Eminent educationists were in charge of the august office of the V-C and the university attracted students from other countries too. The downward trend set in when some powerful groups in the senate and syndicate started ruling PU affairs by proxy. Dirty politics for decades has tarnished the image of the university. The financial crunch is impacting research and hiring of qualified, dynamic faculty. Politics and political interference must end The nominated members must be selected on merit, not on recommendation of vested interests. Quality education, discipline and promoting of the latent talents of students will restore people’s trust in the university.Usha Verma, ChandigarhGenerate funds through innovative initiativesPanjab University will only top the rankings globally and nationally if political interference stops in the appointment of V-C or professors. Secondly, the professors should send research scholars abroad on foreign assignments instead of going themselves as this does not benefit their students or the university. The university should often invite luminaries from all fields from abroad and India to interact with the students and awaken their minds. Instead of fighting the funds crunch the V-C must try to generate funds through innovative initiatives and ensuring that professors who reach retirement age leave the university. Maintenance of the campus and ensuring its cleanliness is also important. Talent should be identified and nurtured. In 1981 PU refused to give funding to its research student Dr Joginder Singh Sidhu, who then went on to the US to earn fame as a scientist, inventor and designer. The world’s smallest and lightest camera is only one of more than 40 innovative products he has developed for the consumer market. He was also instrumental in designing the Smithsonian Institution’s Sikh Gallery in Washington, DC. Such talent should have been accepted and not rejected by PUOpinder Kaur Sekhon, Chandigarh Don’t make it a nursery for political partiesOnce I visited PU in the eighties and I was aghast to hear a senior teacher say our job is to teach and not to do research. Gold is costlier than other metals, what is rare is valuable. Review the system of rotation and time-bound promotions. Give the grades but not the rank. Then comes the Students’ Council. In our times there were no elections for a students’ union. Now PU has become the nursery for political parties. In such a scenario education is relegated to the background. Financial resources depend on grants from the states concerned and the Central government, made generally on political considerations. Political parties through students’ unions will not allow increase in fees. Total student strength, faculty-student ratio and number of research scholars would depend on the job opportunities available. These factors along with strength of students from other countries and states, women students, those from economically and socially challenged categories are subjective and manipulative and unnecessary factors of NIRF. Ranking of a university should be exclusively based on standard of teaching and research of international standard recognition. However, if the University Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences can excel in the existing system then why can’t other departments achieve that standard?Gurdev Singh, MohaliCentral recognition mustStandards of the university are declining due to financial constraints, without full financial support from the states. Not being recognised as a Central university is also affecting PU as it is not getting the financial support it needs to outperform others. That is also why PU is unable to add new infrastructure, allocate more funds for research projects, or depute university teaching staff to foreign universities. The student-teacher ratio is too high so researchers do not get the individual attention that they deserve from guides. Instead of being in the news for its academic achievements, the university is always in the limelight for disagreements between the V-C and the senate. Politics had gone deep into the roots of the university and the teachers and V-C are not on the same page on many issues, which affects the image and the reputation of the institute. Now a number of universities have been set up by corporate houses, with world class infrastructure and best of faculty from around the globe with a great deal of stress on research and performance. With its old ways of life and political interference PU will never be able to hold its own among the best universities in India or abroad. It will now require a total overhaul to outperform or come close to the best. But will the academicians win over the political appointees? That is a million dollar question. Suresh VermaMaintain International standards to improve rankingPanjab University needs to improve the parameters on which ranking assessment is done. Quality of academics should be improved. Student- teacher ratio should be maintained. With more stress on research more patents should be filed. A number of initiatives have to be taken to attract more students to the university. More international students should be enrolled. Inbound and outbound exchange programmes should be offered. Campus placements should be made more attractive and feasible by inviting multinational and international companies with high packages. Student elections should be banned completely as these are just vehicles of propaganda for their parties.Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliEducation should not be dumbed downThe education system is changing to make studies and scoring easier in examinations. The basic standards of education have to be improved to ensure that students and as a result universities improve their performance. Priyam Aggarwal, Chandigarh.Move with the timesNothing can be achieved without discipline, so strict implementation of the academic curriculum will help faculty as well as students power up their performance. New courses geared to help students face the challenges of the modern world should be introduced. It is true that success demands perseverance. Children are the future of the nation and the authority should guide them on the right path. All laboratories should be modernised and research encouraged. Modern technology should be adopted for classroom teaching. Regular and thorough inspection should be done of university and college hostel rooms to ensure students are not distracted from studies in any way.Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliImprove distance learning facilitiesThe reason for PU’s poor performance is stagnation in introducing new courses or giving impetus to research and not revolutionising its distance learning facilities. The alumni association too needs to be galvanized and research given a boost. Undue political interference both at student as well as professorial level must end. Avinash GoyalUpgrade research centresPanjab University is an age-old esteemed institution and has produced eminent scholars since its inception. It has been witnessing a continuous downward trend in various rankings in the last few years. Though its research standards are praiseworthy it has failed to compete with other institutes in the region and nation which have top class infrastructure and valuable collaborations with foreign universities. Their financial strength is also the underlying reason behind their continuous rise and popularity because they charge a hefty tuition fees. PU’s strength lies in its experienced, seasoned and research-oriented faculty. Though it is a public university it has its own limitations and has been facing severe financial problems from the last many years. It now has the responsibility to provide quality and affordable education to students. Meanwhile, the actual reason for drastic drop in rankings can be attributed to the lesser points earned by university in research and citation which needs attention. PU departments, especially science and engineering wings, must come forward to collaborate with the city colleges and professional institutes affiliated with it. Many colleges have research centres on campuses. PU must help upgrade them to push for active participation in research. Colleges and respective university departments need to work in tandem with each other to find solutions to current problems with latest scientific techniques. Such co-ordination will help utilise the talent of students doing masters, graduate and doctorate courses in college departments. Dr Karan Singh Vinayak, ChandigarhResearch infrastructure outdatedThe politicisation of the V-C’s post and also those of the faculty are the primary reasons for the fall in PU’s rankings. The other major factors are negligible recruitments, shortage of faculty from across the country and insufficient funding, besides factionalism and political affiliations of seniors. PU has turned into a cradle of politics and, education has taken a backseat. Research, which was at some point of time was the university’s pride has lost its shine, due to outdated research infrastructure, resulting in knowledge transfer being low. The number of PhDs awarded has decreased drastically. The glory of the university can only be restored by ensuring a healthier educational atmosphere, bonhomie between the faculty and students, and removal of politically inclined persons from the payrolls and student rosters.Rajiv Boolchand Jain, Zirakpur||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-university-s-survival-mantra-keep-politics-out-encourage-research/story-ChRi8tLyQag8LtdG45uvcJ.html

The STF order also asked staff members to get their family members to remove the mobile applications.The applications that have been red-flagged by the STF include short-video app TikTok, and other utility and content apps such as UC browser, Xender, SHAREit and Clean-master.The STF advisory comes in wake of an assessment by intelligence agencies that expressed concern about the safety of at least 53 mobile applications linked to China. The National Security Council Secretariat had backed this assessment of the intelligence community.Also Read: Intel agencies red-flag use of 53 mobile apps with links to China: Complete listAmitabh Yash, Inspector General (IG) of Police of UP STF, said that he had issued an order. He said an internal circular had been issued applicable to STF members to uninstall 52 Chinese applications in view of the possibility that their usage could lead to unauthorised sharing and stealing of personal data.The top STF police officer told Hindustan Times that he had got the notice pasted at different places in the UP STF office in Lucknow and had circulated it on internal groups to ensure 100 percent compliance of the order.Amitabh Yash said they had not listed Zoom video conferencing platform in the list of 52 because “the Zoom meeting platform is already banned for the STF members”.“All staff members were told to uninstall it from their mobile handsets and other devices around a month ago,” he added.In April this year, the Union Home Ministry had issued a general advisory on use of Zoom on the recommendation of the national cybersecurity agency – Computer Emergency Response Team of India (CERT-in). This advisory was issued in light of concerns around its safety.Additional Director General (ADG), Law and Order, Prashant Kumar added that the circular was issued as a precautionary measure and covers applications that, in their assessment, do not have proven credentials or were liable to be misused. It is designed to stay safe and secure in cyberspace, right from a mobile handset to a laptop or desktop computers.Kumar clarified that the state police headquarters had not issued a fresh order on the mobile apps but these are mandatory requirements to be taken by each organisation to stay safe in cyberspace.Amitabh Yas said he had asked STF members to ensure that their family members did not use these applications as our personal information could also be leaked and shared while talking and chatting on them. “My conversation with my wife and children could be shared even if their mobile handset has Chinese applications,” he said in response to a query on the reason behind asking families of STF members to delete the apps.Officials said the decision was taken after considering the possibility of data theft and leaking of personal information via these applications.Amitabh Yash said though he had listed 52 applications in his circular but the most commonly used applications by the people that are included in the list are TikTok, UC Browser, UC News, SHAREIt and WeChat.He said others in the list are Vault Hide, Vigo Video, Bigo Live, Weibo, Beauty Plus, Xender, Club Factory, Helo, LIKE, Kwai, ROMWE, SHEIN, News Dog, Photo Wonder, APUS Browser, Viva Video – QU Video Inc, Perfect Corp, CM Browser, Virus Cleaner (Hi Security Lab), MI Community, DU recorder, You Cam Makeup, MI Store, DU Battery Saver, 360 Security, DU Browser, DU Cleaner, DU Privacy, Clean Master – Cheetah, Cache Cleaner DU apps studio, Baidu Translate, Baidu Map, Wonder Camera, ES File Explorer, QQ International, QQ Launcher, QQ Security Centre, QQ Player, QQ Music, QQ Mall, QQ News Feed, We Sync, Selfie City, Clash of Kings, Mail Master, MI Video call – Xiomi and Parallel Space.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-stf-cracks-down-tells-staffers-to-delete-52-apps-linked-to-china/story-m1gdokSIQBxEfbjwCiFZEJ.html

19-06-2020||Dehradun||Kedarnath shrine’s ‘prasad’ can soon be ordered online, home-delivered||The district administration in Uttarakhand’s Rudryaprayag will soon begin the home delivery of the ‘prasad’ of Kedarnath shrine, officials said on Friday. The decision was taken considering the less number of devotees at the shrine due to Covid-19 pandemic and also to provide livelihood to the women self-help groups associated with the temple which is among the char dhams in Uttarakhand. Manvinder Kaur, chief development officer, Rudraprayag said, “The idea of home delivery of the prasad of Kedarnath temple came after it was observed that the devotees are not able to visit the temple as the Char Dham yatra is yet to start normally.”“As only local devotees are able to visit the temple and that too, in less numbers due to obvious reasons, we would soon take online order of the prasad from them and deliver it to their homes,” said Kaur.Elaborating about the online prasad service, the official said, it will initially start in Rudraprayag district and then eventually be extended to other parts of state and country. “First we will start the service from Rudraprayag district and then, will gradually extend it to the whole country. We are in talks with some companies for providing us an online platform for the orders and then, in association with courier companies, will start delivering them,” he said. Kaur said, the administration will make “packs comprising laddoo and yagna material as prasad under the initiative.”“All the aforementioned materials are being made women self-help groups associated with us. At present when the temple is almost deserted, their income has also stalled. This initiative, when started, will give them a sort of steady source of income,” said Kaur. “Talks with all the parties concerned are on and the initiative will start in next seven days,” she added. Kedarnath along with and Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri, collectively called Char Dham, is one of the most revered pilgrimages in the Hindu tradition and attract lakhs of pilgrims each year.The portals of Kedarnath shrine had been opened on April 29 and the first prayers were offered on behalf of Prime PM Modi to help the country fight against the coronavirus pandemic.With the view to stop the spread of Covid-19 disease, the state government, on June 9, issued guidelines for ‘darshan’ at the Char Dham shrines that include Kedarnath, allowing only local residents to visit. Under the guidelines, pilgrims from outside the state won’t be allowed in till June 30, and only residents of the districts where the temples are located will be permitted to make limited visits to the shrines.However, the move was opposed by the shrine’s priests who said they wouldn’t support visits to the shrine even by locals due to the prevailing situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/kedarnath-shrine-s-prasad-can-soon-be-ordered-online-home-delivered/story-TZMScoObVzkx3jO3X9uPUK.html

They alleged that ever since the colony was declared a containment zone, there has been an acute paucity of basic enmities. “Neither can we go out for work nor can anyone else enter our locality. There is no milk in the house. The ration is also drying up. Medicines have also finished. We are totally at loss. We do not know what to do and for how long this will continue,” said Rohit Kumar, a trader residing in the area.Vikas Sabharwal, another resident, said, “It has been nearly 15 days since I have stepped out of the house. It gets really depressing sometimes. Our only submission is that those who have been tested negative should be allowed to leave the containment zone. Children and elderly are terrified of this arrangement. Majority of the people living here eke out their living by doing menial jobs. If they continue to remain at home, they will lose their job. How to will they run their household then.” When contacted, Surinder Atwal, councillor of ward 84, in which the colony falls, said that basic facilities are being provided to residents. “I am sure that if residents raised their voice, there must have been good reason. But I urge them to cooperate with us in these testing times,” said Atwal.The densely populated locality was declared a containment zone on June 6 after 15 contacts of a 53-year-old man, who succumbed to the virus on May 29, tested positive for Covid-19. Currently, the locality has 35 positive patients. Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said, “The health department is conducting intensive house-to-house checking, surveillance, contact tracing and sampling in the area. Right now, only essential and medical services is being provided in the area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/high-drama-at-ludhiana-s-chhawani-mohalla-as-residents-demand-lifting-of-containment-restrictions/story-U0Qn01jAc90r748DKqhSBO.html

He alleged that most private schools were not even conducting online classes and still collected the whole fees instead of just tuition fees. Private schools are pressurising parents to pay fees by regularly sending them text messages, he said.Mehra alleged that private schools have removed miscellaneous charges like annual charges, smart classroom charges, sports fees and other charges from the fee book and included them in the tuition fees, increasing it by four times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/student-parent-forum-holds-stir-in-shimla-against-private-schools-charging-arbitrary-fees/story-vVQ3MLvGEO4kmvJ2RWIA0K.html
19-06-2020||Chandigarh||Patiala’s Govt Rajindra Hospital lags behind in Covid-19 testing, only 800 samples collected||Government Rajindra hospital, which is one of the tertiary health care institutes of Punjab, with the strength of around 12,000 employees, has only collected 800 samples so far, while the district health department has collected 16,000 samples.The first Covid-19 case was recorded in Punjab on March 5 but the hospital only started taking samples of suspected patients after June 1. Before June 1, all samples had been collected by the district health department.An official of the health department, requesting anonymity, said, “Rajindra hospital has trained staff and doctors while we have had to include untrained dentists and ayurveda doctors in our teams. Had the hospital had started collecting samples from beginning, it would have eased the work load of the health department.”‘MISMANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES’A doctor, pleading anonymity, said, “Resources have been mismanaged. Rajindra hospital has a Covid-19 testing lab, trained and experienced doctors but they delayed sample collection. Had they started earlier, the situation could be different as the contacts of positive could be traced and treated sooner,” he addedGovernment Rajindra College and Hospital principal Dr Harjinder Singh said, “Earlier, the government had not allowed Rajindra Hospital to collect samples.”PRIVATE LAB SEALED FOR NOT TAKING PRECAUTIONARY MEASURESThe district health department has sealed the Ashoka Clinical laboratory for not taking precautionary measures while collecting blood samples. The department also served the laboratory a notice.The department said a 47-year-old Covid-19 patient had visited the lab a few days ago and the staff had taken her blood samples without following precautions.District epidemiologist Dr Sumeet Singh said, “The lab was sealed for seven days for violating the Covid-19 safety guidelines. The breech was discovered while tracing the contacts of a Covid-19 patient.”“At the lab, we found that none of the staff had been wearing masks and gloves. The lab was also located in the common area where staff members were interacting with the public. As per government guideline, the lab should be located in a separate area from a public dealing place,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/patiala-s-govt-rajindra-hospital-lags-behind-in-covid-19-testing-only-800-samples-collected/story-NAIu7qh7Hw1uPaJ0AMyHqJ.html

19-06-2020||Pune||Man arrested by PCMC police for murdering father||A 38-year-old man has been arrested by the Pimpri-Chinchwad police for the murder of his father, according to the police.The murder allegedly happened over money dispute, police said.The man, identified as Rajesh alias Datta Mutayya Polkam (38), a resident of Khadki area of Pune, has been remanded to five days in police custody by a local court on Thursday.The deceased has been identified as Sunil Muttayya Polkam, 68, a resident of Bhatia chawl in Dapodi, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Bhosari police station of the Pimpri-Chinchwad police.The body was found with all four limbs bound to the bed in the house. The man was reportedly bludgeoned to death with his limbs tied to the bed. The police responded to calls made by the neighbours. As nobody answered the door, the police broke open the lock of the house and found the body on Wednesday.The reason behind the murder was the refusal of the now deceased man to lend money to his son in order to buy a new tempo, according to inspector Shankar Awtade of Bhosari police station.“The arrested man used to work on a daily-wage basis and wanted to buy a mini truck for transport business. His father had retired from a private company 10 years ago and had retirement money and pension,” said assistant inspector Gajanan Bansode of Bhosari police station, who is investigating the case.The man had come to his father’s house for lunch on Tuesday. “He was drunk and was asking for money that evening while eating. As the father refused to give him the money, he killed him,” said API Bansode.The deceased remained indoors on most days and the neighbours did not have any idea about his whereabouts, according to police. After identifying the deceased, the police set up two teams that questioned all known family members and realised that the son had not returned to his own house in Khadki, where he lived with his family.A case under Section 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) of Indian Penal Code was registered against the arrested man at Bhosari police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/man-arrested-by-pcmc-police-for-murdering-father/story-Ik1anL7bweKcidK0ikpgjP.html

19-06-2020||Delhi||Separated by Covid, Delhi prisoners and families demand e-meetings||Vijay Nahar Singh, 40, was arrested in a murder case eight years ago and is an undertrial inmate at Tihar jail. He was also charged under provisions of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crimes Act (MCOCA) that has stringent bail terms, which he could not avail. His only connection with the outside world and his eight-year-old daughter was the bi-weekly mulaqaats (meeting with family, allowed under Delhi Prison Rules) for 30 minutes.Since March, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, this provision was suspended and only five-minute phone calls -- that the prisoner could request to make from the jail’s landline connections -- were allowed in the three jail complexes of Tihar, Mandoli and Rohini. The move was to try and contain the virus from spreading inside jails, which could turn into hot spots if it did. Rajouri Garden resident Singh’s wife, who did not wish to be named, said “I can only speak to him for a few minutes. He is worried about our health. With no money in hand, he can’t even buy anything for himself to boost his immunity during this pandemic,” she said.The prison department also released around 3,000 prisoners on interim bail and parole from, to allow for social distancing. However, this has not stopped the virus from penetrating jails -- the three complexes, which together house a total of 14,000 prisoners and around 1800 jail officers, have reported 20 cases of Covid-19 till date among prisoners and jail officers. Senior prison officers said that contact tracing so far has revealed that in all the three jails, the virus reached the prison through jail officers, who did not show any symptoms.Forty-year-old Farhad Khan, a resident of Govindpuri, was convicted in a drugs case in 2015 and is serving a 10-year term. With a history of asthma and chest related illnesses, Khan is an “at-risk” inmate and got bail on May 14. On June 12, Khan’s wife, who had wished not to be named, the last two months were difficult for them. “I am battling depression and my husband has asthma and vision problems. Since the meetings were stopped, I have no way to know about his health or deposit money for him during Ramzan so that he could enjoy a few treats,” the 45-year-old had said. “I seem to have symptoms of Covid-19.”Three days after this conversation, she died. Her test results confirmed the virus.“I was allowed only a two-minute phone call with her when I was in jail till my bail,” said Khan, who spoke “Half of that time time would pass in getting clear voice due to patchy network. And now, she has left me within a month.”The prisoners’ families now, through their lawyers, are demanding that an alternative solutions, such as video conferencing, should be chalked out to solve their problems. Experts too say that the prison must work on starting e-visits for families. Kalkaji resident Murugan, 21, whose father is an undertrial in a rape case in Tihar, said, “The jail authorities should allow e-mulaquats so that the inmates can at least see their relatives over video and be assured about their health and needs,” he said, adding that he has not been able deposit money into his father’s jail account either. The jail account allows prisoners to withdraw cash and buy provisions from the prison canteens. The prisons’ inspector general, Raj Kumar, however, said there were no plans to start such “virtual” meetings. Experts said that such virtual meetings could help de-stress the prisoners.Ajay Verma , former convener of the National Forum for Prison Reforms -- a group of lawyers that fights for implementation of reforms across prisons --- said, “It will reduce stress of the prisoners. A few states have begun work on it. Visitors can make online registration and meet the prisoners through video conferencing without travelling to prisons”.The Punjab and Haryana High Court allowed the states under their jurisdiction to begin virtual meetings for prisoners and their families, while a petition in the Odisha High Court is also requesting the same.Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa said that prisoners still in jail should be given proper facilities to touch base with their families especially in times of a pandemic. “The state government should take some steps for conducting e-mulaqaat because unusual situation calls for unusual actions,” he said.Sunil Gupta, former law officer of Tihar for over three decades, said that all jails in the prison complexes were equipped with video conferencing equipment used for court hearing as well as the legal aid lawyers. “The same facilities can be used by the prisoners to meet their families,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/separated-by-covid-delhi-prisoners-and-families-demand-e-meetings/story-38Iy7MBkAokxc7Q3x5czxO.html

The health authorities have not even set up the building where the equipment is to be installed. The Punjab health systems corporation is yet to accord approval for use of its premisesHospital sources said that to run ventilators, a dedicated staff, including a medical officer, staff nurses and Class-4 employees are required. However, the same was not available.The hospital is equipped with 75 beds to accommodate coronavirus patients but in case of an emergency the patients are referred to higher institutions in other districts. Critical non-Covid-19 cases too have to be taken to private hospitals for resuscitation. Senior medical officer (SMO) Dr Jaswinder Singh said efforts were being made to get rid of the technical hiccups. “We have written to the health department to provide us with the required staff. A proposal has also been sent to the health systems corporation for altering the building for installation of ventilators. Work will start as soon as we get the sanctions,” said Singh.He said a team had been sent to Kapurthala to study the technicalities associated with ventilator installation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ventilators-gather-dust-in-hoshiarpur-civil-hospital-as-administrative-glitches-delay-installation/story-bPSRLu8trzwF714ytVUEVO.html

19-06-2020||City||Punjab Agricultural University turns to social media to advice farmers, receives encouraging response||Technology is proving to be a game changer for Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, in the wake of the coronavirus-induced pandemic. Farmers have had to face many challenges due to the coronavirus disease. Covid-19 led to the cancellation of the highly anticipated Kisan Mela and the exodus of farm labour forced farmers to adopt alternative techniques such as direct seeding of rice (DSR).Faced with the unprecedented challenge of educating farmers while also observing social distancing, PAU experts turned to the varsity’s Facebook page on June 1 to sensitise farmers about rodent management and seed germination.With three episodes aired so far, the weekly question-answer programme has become a major hit among farmers not just of the region but also in Pakistan.Amid the encouraging responses of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, were also encouraging comments from the Agricultural University in Pakistan’s Faisalabad.23,000 VIEWS RECEIVED The Facebook page has received an unprecedented response and the second session held on June 10 received nearly 23,000 views (with a people reach up to 55,000), while the latest edition that was conducted on June 17 has received 11,000 views so far.A Pakistan-based PhD scholar Usman Tatla wrote in the comments that the university was doing an outstanding job.Senior agronomist Makhan Singh Bhullar, who is the point person for paddy sowing through DSR technology and bed planting said the university decided to reach out to farmers through Facebook after the Kisan Mela scheduled before the Kharif season was cancelled and the Kisan Vakas Kendra remained closed during lockdown, said Bhullar.“It was important for us to reach out to farmers as they are facing a host of issues. Due to labour shortage a significant number of farmers have switched to DSR. With no previous experience of sowing, some of them faced germination issues and had trouble with rodents,” said Dr Bhullar.FIRST TIMERS BENEFIT Gurnaib Singh from Faridkot district, who is opting for the DSR technique for the first time, said the Facebook interaction session had proved to be a boon for farmers like him.“Since it was a new initiative we were worried about whether the seeds will germinate but the expert session cleared all our doubts. We are following the advice of PAU experts and seeds have started germinating,” said Gurnaib Singh.Harman Singh Gill of Gurdaspur said, “Despite PAU issuing a warning asking farmers not to transplant seeds before June, I had planted the seed in May. The seeds hardened due too untimely rain and I had trouble with germination. I reached out to the PAU experts through their Facebook page and their advice was instrumental in saving my crop,” said Gill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-agricultural-university-turns-to-social-media-to-advice-farmers-receives-encouraging-response/story-H9QwUJxGgVHvSdVzJmIAnN.html

19-06-2020||Chandigarh||Suicide cases dip in Haryana during lockdown, psychologists say family support helps||Karnal: Staying with family may help fight suicidal thoughts, say psychologists, referring to the decline in the number of suicide cases in Haryana during the lockdown period.Though people had to face hardships during the lockdown enforced to slow the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, the state saw a decline in the number of cases of suicide.Haryana Police data shows that 93 people committed suicide in Haryana from March 1 to May 31 this year, against 155 cases reported last year during the same period. The maximum number of 47 suicides was reported in May as compared to 60 in the same month last year.Despite the state witnessing two suicides by Covid-19 patients in Faridabad and Yamunanagar districts on Thursday, Haryana director general of police (DGP) crime, PK Agrawal says there is no specific reason for the decline in numbers just as it could not be ascertained what led people to take the extreme step.According to police officials dealing with suicide cases, besides fear and loneliness, the non-availability of alcohol and addictive drugs could have led people to commit suicide. Two people admitted to Karnal’s Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College and Hospital committed suicide in May because they were habitual drinkers and could not get liquor in the lockdown.NO PARTICULAR REASONPsychologists say that mental illness, depression, loneliness, hopelessness and sometimes homesickness and pressure of study or competition among students may lead to suicidal thoughts.“There is no a particular reason for suicides as it depends upon the temperament of a person. It varies from individual to individual as many people are over-achievers. When they fail to achieve their aim, they lose hope,” said Ranjana Singh, the chairperson of the department of psychology at Kurukshetra University.About the decline in cases in Haryana during the lockdown, she said, “We can’t say that the lockdown reduced the risk of suicide but it seems the support of family members helped. Generally, people living alone or in nuclear families are more prone to suicidal thoughts.”Rohtash Singh, a professor of social psychology, said, “Chemical imbalance in the brain may lead people to depression or commit suicide but we cannot specify any particular reason for taking such a step.”On fewer cases during the lockdown, he said: “Social and family ties in Haryana are still strong.”BUCKING THE TRENDThe data shows a few districts saw an increase in the number of suicides. Eight suicides were reported in Panipat from March 1 to June 15 against 10 in the same period last year but the district witnessed five cases from June 1 to 15 this year.Some districts also saw an increase during this period as in Ambala, where 23 people committed suicide during the lockdown against 18 during the same period last year.Twelve suicides were reported in Rohtak from March 25 to June 15 this year against nine cases in the same period in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/suicide-cases-dip-in-haryana-during-lockdown-psychologists-say-family-support-helps/story-wGmPn3NhfNBuxDoNQZM7IK.html

The government officials have time and again promised us that our salaries will be increased but nothing has been done on ground,” said Kamaljeet Singh Chauhan, vice-chairperson of the association.“The government hires pharmacists on contractual basis and this year the contracts have not been renewed.

Despite working in the emergency situations, the government is not fulfilling our demands,” he said. The association’s district president Gurdeep Singh said, “Besides regularising our jobs, the government should increase the salaries of frontline warriors. The employees should be provided medical insurance and the benefits that are available to other medical staff.”Singh said all pharmacists of the state had boycotted Covid-related duties on Friday and protesters were being staged in different districts of Punjab.“We will re-join our Covid-19 duties once the government assures us regularisation of jobs and hikes our salaries.

But Covid-19 made me change some of my old habits. I had not changed my diet for decades, which was actually not suitable for my age.” “After the infection, I decided to change my diet and make it healthier. I also learnt to become adaptable to the changing situations,” he added.A 60-year-old female patient, who returned home from hospital on June 1, says she does remember how she contracted the infection as she never left her place during the lockdown.The woman, who is suffering from diabetes, said, “I have now decided to maintain more hygienic and healthier lifestyle. I have now started consuming some healthy food items, which were never a part of my diet earlier.“I have learnt to ear right food as per the changing season and spending time with the self. During the treatment and the quarantine time, I also turned towards spirituality,” she said.Another recovered woman patient, who is 61 years old, said that Covid-19 has brought several changes in her life.“Generally, elders in any family expect others members to follow what they say.

19-06-2020||Chandigarh||Racism row: Trudeau supports Canada’s NDP leader Jagmeet Singh||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday stood behind the leader of an opposition party who had been temporarily thrown out of Parliament for accusing another member of racism. Head of the New Democratic Party (NDP) Jagmeet Singh, a Sikh, is the first member of a minority to lead a federal political party in Canada. On Wednesday, he clashed with a member of the separatist Bloc Quebecois party who refused to sign onto an NDP motion to recognise systemic racism in the federal police force. “It is disappointing that the Bloc Quebecois continues to refuse to accept that systemic discrimination, systemic racism exists within our country, in every part of our country and in all our institutions,” Trudeau said during his daily press conference. “Recognising systemic discrimination is the important first step towards being able to address it.”“There are conversations that have to happen if we want to move forward as a country,” he said, claiming it was not his place to criticise a racial minority’s expression of a “lived reality” of racism. The Bloc Quebecois’s Alain Therrien had refused to sign onto the NDP motion, and after a heated exchange, Singh accused Therrien of being racist. Singh refused to apologise and was temporarily removed from the chamber. Bloc Quebecois party head Yves-Francois Blanchet defended Therrien and demanded sanctions against Singh. “I hope that the leader of the NDP will apologise sincerely, and if not, I hope the president of the House of Commons will be quite severe,” he said. “Because if the only penalty is not being allowed to be in the room for one day or to not be allowed to speak for one day, everybody will feel entitled to do the same.”The NPD is the fourth-biggest political party in the country with 24 seats out of the 338 in the House of Commons, while the Bloc Quebecois has 32. The feud comes as Canadians have joined worldwide protests against systemic racism and police violence following the police killing of black American man George Floyd last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/racism-row-trudeau-supports-canada-s-ndp-leader-jagmeet-singh/story-DxWruwTqPaX4QrLGsyjpQM.html

19-06-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: His good old school days||That grownups shall feel nostalgic about their school days in nothing out of the ordinary. But it sure is bizarre when this happens to be the sentiment of a 12-year-old boy.Such is the extent of the upside-down state of the world, during the coronavirus pandemic it is currently struggling with.“I’m missing my school, I’m missing my friends,” says Om Kumar Yadav, a fifth standard student in a primary school. He is surprised that he never realised before that he could ever miss going to school. Talking on WhatsApp video from his home in Gurugram’s Sector 14, Mr Yadav excitedly shows—through the phone screen that connects him to this reporter—his textbooks and the basta (book bag) that he would carry daily to his classes.But that was another time.He hasn’t been to school since it was closed in late April, as part of the national lockdown plan.“I so much want to wear my uniform of sky blue shirt, dark blue pants and black shoes and walk to the school again.” Mr Yadav now studies alone at home, but in the school he used to sit in a crowded room of 40 classmates. “Three of them are very close friends,” he says. “Atul’s papa is a policeman, Sadab’s papa is a salesman in a shop, and Manish’s papa is a worker who builds houses.”Mr Yadav’s father is a tea seller. They live together, along with young Mr Yadav’s younger brother. The mother lives in their native village in Bihar.The young man hasn’t met his “best friends” since the start of the lockdown. “But I keep in touch with them on WhatsApp.” He uses his father’s phone for the purpose.WhatsApp has more solemn uses, too. School teachers send him lesson works through WhatsApp.Sitting by his study desk, placed just beside the TV, Mr Yadav logs on to his desktop computer and talks about missing his beloved teacher. “Neelam ma’am is very serious but very nice... and when we are being naughty, she tells us stories from her own childhood, when she also used to be naughty — but within limits.”Mr Yadav describes himself to be a very obedient school student, who likes to sit on the front bench. A moment later, he confesses “sometimes I also sit on the back benches, when my friends urge me to.” And then, far from the teacher’s eye, they would whisper about the movies they had watched the previous night on TV.“I also miss my school desk... my table is covered with drawings and messages that I would sometimes make with pencil and sometimes with the compass.”But now there is no knowing when the school will open. Apart from the work given by the teachers, Mr Yadav also has downloaded an app on his “tablet” that helps him with assignments in Maths and English.“I’ve now gotten used to online studies.”And yet, “I still want to return to the school. Right now I’m seeing everything in apps and videos, but in school I see all of that in reality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-his-good-old-school-days/story-77E7RZJSs8RaOMH872v34J.html
19-06-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Chickenwale is no more||In most places these days, the news of a death spreads through WhatsApp and Facebook. But in Old Delhi, plastering a handwritten note on a public wall continues to be a preferred practice to circulate this kind of sad occurrence.On Wednesday morning the meat shop near Rangrez Wali Masjid didn’t open. Instead, the passersby found a piece of paper taped on the metal shutters. It was handwritten in blue ink and in Urdu, and it read: “Bhai Aijaz Chickenwale passed away last evening and his final journey will begin at 11 am today.”Muhammed Aijaz ‘Chickenwale’ died of heart failure, aged 56. He was an integral feature of this corner of the Walled City. Every morning he would be seen sitting cross-legged in his little shop, beside his chopping block and butcher’s knife, with chickens cooped up in metal cages. His son, Muhammed Shariq, would be perched quietly behind him. And atop the stacks of chicken cages would stand in all its dignity his immortal “murga”, his one animal that could never die—a giant wooden rooster that he had received as a gift from a friend some years ago.Like many other shopkeepers in the area, Mr Aijaz was a friendly man, and locals on their way to Turkman Gate or Dilli Gate would often stop by to gossip with him for a few minutes. Mr Aijaz would remain seated in his shop, and the acquaintance would continue to stand on the narrow street during this brief chitchat—while the rest of the crowd would circulate about them like a motion blur.One would also come across such small town scenes in the pages of an RK Narayan novel.Mr Aijaz had been running a paan shop for about three decades but turned it into a chicken meat shop five years ago, on the urgings of his ambitious son who saw no future in paan. Since then he came to be known as Bhai Aijaz Chickenwale.On Tuesday evening, some time after the Isha prayers, Mr Aijaz closed the shop at its usual hour and started walking home, in Ganj Meer Khan neighbourhood behind Delite Cinema. By the time he reached Gali Sooiwallan, he was feeling uneasy enough to decide to stop at his brother’s home there. Soon afterwards, he collapsed. Doctor Mukhtar, the area’s popular medical practitioner, pronounced him dead. His family quickly took him to a nearby hospital that gave the same verdict.The following afternoon Mr Aijaz was buried at his father’s grave in Dili Gate Qabristan. This sprawling cemetry, near ITO crossing, is the final home of many Old Delhi dwellers, including many people with distinct professions who came to be known as ‘wale’ such as Vaseem Hornwale and Jameel Ahmed Fishwale. The funeral procession consisted of twenty mourners who dutifully exercised the precepts of physical distancing to minimise the risks of catching coronavirus.Mr Aijaz is survived by his wife, Rukhsana Begum, and the aforementioned son, Muhammed Shaqir. In his early 20s, he was seen in his masked face walking the market lanes the morning after his father’s death, stopping acquaintances to inform them of the news. He says he will reopen the chicken shop on Sunday. It will then be his turn to to be known as “Chickenwale”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-chickenwale-is-no-more/story-VMOPzGn835uZIrW0eK7Y8O.html

Earlier, the quarantine period was 14 days.The nodal officer or head of the department will form a sub-committee to assess the level of exposure and the risk, as per the assessment format issued by the health ministry.After a week, the worker shall be tested for Covid-19, actively monitored for development of symptoms and managed as per the laid down protocol. “If they test positive but remain asymptomatic they will follow protocol for very mild/mild/presymptomatic cases… If they test negative and remain asymptomatic, complete 14 day quarantine and return to work. Should symptoms develop, person will be isolated,” the advisory says.“Those who test negative, will be managed in non-Covid areas as per their clinical diagnosis. Their resuming work will be based on the clinical diagnosis and the medical certification by the treating doctor.” The step was taken in view of the shortage of health care workers at many hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/7-day-quarantine-for-health-workers-now/story-zj3rJOimjEwpGGhtJQMAwO.html
19-06-2020||Bangalore||Karnataka maps vulnerable groups||Karnataka has become the first state to map its population that is most vulnerable to Covd-19, including the aged and those with comorbidities. These groups are currently being tracked on a daily basis with a view to prevent the onset of a severe Covid-19 infection. Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa briefed Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the state’s strategy on Wednesday during a meeting of all CMs to assess the pandemic situation.Of the 16.8 million households in the state, the government has already surveyed about 15 million households in the past three months. The survey identified the aged population as well as those with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and cancer. These two groups are the most susceptible to the virus, officials said.The ongoing survey has so far identified about 6 million families with comorbidities and/or old age. According to officials, Karnataka is the first major state to map citizens in such a manner so the local administrations can track them easily.“These susceptible families are monitored daily. Twice a day, they receive a phone call enquiring after their health. The state government has informed the Centre that it has employed an IT firm to track people, apart from the usual data from government departments,” said a senior official.The Centre had earlier asked states to use technology, such as tracking the phones numbers, to keep a tab on vulnerable people.Along with Tamil Nadu, Karnataka was the first to cap the Covid treatment costs in private hospitals—a move that is now being considered by other states.The state now has 72 Covid-19 testing labs which can carry out 15,000 tests daily, a state official said. On average, 7,500 people per million are being tested, Yediyurappa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-maps-vulnerable-groups/story-jbBS8H47BJg2IrsPc8JrsL.html
19-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh education department plans to hold admission process for 2020-21 online||The Chandigarh education department is planning to conduct admissions to the academic year of 2020-2021 for all classes completely online.The decision was taken in order to ensure social distancing amid the rising cases of coronavirus in the city, not to mention the fact that schools are still closed.There are 114 government schools in Chandigarh in which over 1 lakh students are already enrolled.Confirming the development, Rubinderjit Singh Brar, director school education, said a proposal regarding the same was on the table and will be finalised within a day or so. “We are planning to hold the admissions process online this time. We will display the total number of seats that are vacant in each class, and the parents will have to fill in an online form, after which counseling will be held,” he said.“We might release a circular tomorrow or day after as and when it’s finalised,” he added.Brar also informed that for the parents who cannot access online forms, the admission forms will also be available at various government schools.A teacher of Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 16, said, “We have been instructed that if any parent comes to the school to get the child admitted, we have to provide them admission forms ensuring social distancing. In schools, 25% of staff is already present, along with principals. All of us are working to ensure the admission process goes smoothly.”Under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, the government schools cannot deny admission to any child between the age of 6 to 14 till class 8. However, there are certain regulations. Children can seek admission in only those schools that are in their neighborhood as per the neighbourhood policy under the RTE.Moreover, multiple parents of children studying in the city’s private schools have approached the education department regarding switching of schools amid job losses and high fee of private schools. Sources have said the department, too, has decided to hold a special admission campaign for all such parents. The same would be advertised in the month of July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-education-department-plans-to-hold-admission-process-for-2020-21-online/story-jfp3JByi9jUDbKcNn7XaBK.html

19-06-2020||City||Maharashtra CM reiterates stand over scrapping final-year exams||Despite objections raised by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari over the state’s decision to scrap final-year exams for non-professional courses for academic year 2019-20, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray is unlikely to go back on the announcement. In a meeting presided over by him on matters pertaining to the exams pending due to the Covid-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown, the CM reiterated his decision to not hold final-year exams in the state. The state government is also likely to suggest all the central councils for professional courses to take a decision on similar lines, as Maharashtra is currently not in a position to conduct exams, officials said. A final decision on the matter is likely to be announced soon.“During the meeting, the CM said we can’t play with the lives of the students by conducting exams. Final-year exams for non-professional courses must not be held,” said a senior official, who attended the meet. Thackeray also directed the officials to hold a meeting with vice-chancellors of universities to decide on what can be done for ATKT (allowed to keep terms) students. On Wednesday, in a meeting via video conferencing, CM had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to issue uniform guidelines for holding exams for professional and non-professional courses governed by central councils. He had also informed PM that the state has decided to promote students from non-professional courses on the basis of their grades in the previous terms, as conducting exams in the near future was not possible.The development may escalate the ongoing tussle between the Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and the Governor. On June 2, Koshyari had said the CM’s May 31 announcement to scrap exams was made “without any profound thinking” on legal repercussions. He had also asserted that he is the chancellor of all universities, and so the decision over exams will be taken in consonance with the provisions of the Maharashtra Public Universities Act. On May 22, the Governor had written to CM to resolve the issue of university exams, while objecting to a recommendation made by higher and technical education minister Uday Samant to the University Grants Commission (UGC) to cancel final-year exams. However, officials are of the view that as the state has invoked Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act, which supersede all other acts, a decision taken by the Maharashtra government will be considered final. The state unit of the Opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), as well as students’ organisation Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) have demanded the state to conduct examinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-cm-reiterates-stand-over-scrapping-final-year-exams/story-jnd7h4XzkbGrsV4TC8C8PM.html
19-06-2020||City||16% students in Maharashtra have no access to radio, TV or mobile phone: State education department data||A total of 15.88% students from the state have no access to any medium of communication (radio, TV or mobile phone) for online education, according to the data obtained from the state education department. Also, 26.33% students don’t have access to even a non-android mobile phone. The department collected the data from select clusters of 35 districts of the state to understand the access to various means of communication for students, with schools not being able to reopen in most parts owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. HT has a copy of the report. The department is yet to come up with a final report. At 37.48%, Palghar tops the list of students with no access to any medium of communication, followed by Gadchiroli (36.23%) and Nandurbar (29.87%). Even in Mumbai, which has the highest penetration of WhatsApp (70.33%), 3.58% students do not have access to a mobile phone, TV or radio. The number is 16.29% in neighbouring Thane and 10.88% in Pune. Across the state, 43.64% students have access to WhatsApp. With a large number of students still not having access to mediums required for online communication, the department has decided to follow a hybrid method of online and offline learning to reach out to every student. “We are exploring all possible options. Those who do not have internet and phones would get textbooks delivered home and we have asked teachers to speak to such students over the phone. The local administration and schools will have to reach those without access to any mode of communication,” state education minister Varsha Gaikwad had said in a meeting with the media on June 15. Hemangi Joshi, city-based Right to Education activist, said in such a scenario, the state government should start schools in remote areas as soon as possible. “At least in places where cases haven’t been reported in the past few days, schools can start operations to ensure students do not miss out on learning. If online learning is only for a few days, it is okay. But if it is going to continue for longer, the government would have to draw up a detailed plan for students with no access to any mode of communication,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/16-students-in-maharashtra-have-no-access-to-radio-tv-or-mobile-phone-state-education-department-data/story-Imik9X4zomdPW6hBYWcU2O.html
19-06-2020||City||Bhiwandi records 33 new Covid-19 deaths||Bhiwandi reported 33 new deaths on Thursday. As per district records, this is the highest number of single-day Covid deaths reported from any city in Thane district so far. However, authorities claim that these are pending reports of those who died outside the city in the last two weeks. The city has also recorded 727 positive cases of Covid-19.Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) commissioner Pravin Ashthikar said, “We can only record the deaths once we received the death summary of the patients. Several such summaries were pending, as they had to be acquired and then added to the list of deaths. Most of these patients took treatment in hospitals in the nearby cities.”The city is under a complete lockdown for the next 15 days, owing to the increasing cases.The first day of lockdown in Bhiwandi saw a good response from the residents on Thursday, with no public gathering or crowding on the streets or markets. The shops in the city were shut throughout the day, barring the exceptions of those selling essential items such as groceries and milk. Meanwhile, in neighbouring Kalyan and Dombivli, the total number of Covid-19 cases has surged to 2,779, after 212 new cases, including two new deaths were reported on Thursday. Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) epidemic officer Pratibha Panpatil said, “The increase in cases is owing to the high-risk contacts of asymptomatic patients, who are mostly home quarantined, testing positive. Out of the cases reported till now 80 percent are asymptomatic.”KDMC will close down its headquarters in Dombivli near Indira Gandhi Chowk after one worker in this building was tested Covid positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhiwandi-records-33-new-covid-19-deaths/story-NGatS7BGpQS5x3za6M8r2N.html
19-06-2020||City||Ruckus in Thane as locals stop civic staff from tracing contacts of Covid patient||More than 60 local residents of Gokul Nagar slum in Thane stopped Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) staff from tracing contacts of a patient on Wednesday, claiming the patient had tested positive more than two weeks ago. On June 4, two residents of Gokul Nagar, aged 48 and 62, tested positive. The 62-year-old patient died on Wednesday night, while the 48-year-old recovered. As another 67-year-old man tested positive on Tuesday, TMC officials arrived on Wednesday to take his family and neighbours to a quarantine centre.Local residents, however, created a ruckus, thinking the officials were tracing contacts of the patient who had recovered. Even though TMC officials clarified that the survey was for the other patient, the residents refused to give in.Shankar Patole, assistant civic commissioner of the ward, said, “We reached the area to take the high-risk contacts to a quarantine centre on Wednesday. Coincidentally, one of the patients who had tested positive a fortnight ago had returned home after recovering. Locals thought we had visited the slums to quarantine his contacts, but we had come for another patient. As people refused to cooperate, we had to return without quarantining any of the residents who were at high risk.”Satish Bane, 34, a resident of Gokul Nagar, said, “The officials came with a bus to take away our neighbours to quarantine centres as they were high-risk contact of those who tested positive 15 days ago. Such lackadaisical behaviour by the corporation was unexpected. They had come to quarantine the family and neighbours of a patient who has already recovered. We started asking them for details but they were confused and backed off. There was no major ruckus.”Local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator Krishna Patil said that there were no more positive cases in their lane apart from those who tested positive in the first week of June. “Why was there a delay in quarantining the high-risk contacts? There is no point in quarantining contacts after the patients have recovered.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ruckus-in-thane-as-locals-stop-civic-staff-from-tracing-contacts/story-3FEy232sRpzNfTukjjsunO.html
19-06-2020||Mumbai||Vehicular pollution 60% up in Mumbai after lockdown curbs relaxed: SAFAR||Since lockdown restrictions were relaxed on June 1, the city has recorded a sharper rise in levels of traffic pollution than other major cities in India.System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) compared pollution levels between June 1 and June 14 with those recorded between May 18 and May 31, for Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad and Delhi. Mumbai witnessed a 60% increase in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels (from vehicular emissions and fossil fuel burning) compared to levels recorded during the fourth phase of the lockdown, according to an analysis released by SAFAR on Thursday. Pune and Ahmedabad witnessed less than 10% rise in NO2 levels while Delhi recorded 6% decline in NO2 even after restrictions were relaxed. “The sudden increase in vehicular traffic combined with rising industrial production may have contributed to the sudden surge in NO2 concentration over Mumbai. Also, it shows the role played by the transport sector as a major source of air pollution in the financial capital,” said Gufran Beig, director, SAFAR.Between March 25 and April 14, Mumbai had recorded the sharpest decline in NO2 levels (72%) as compared with levels recorded during the same period in 2019 as well as concentration during the months prior to lockdown. From April 15 to May 3, the percentage reduction fell marginally but a 64% decline was recorded. The percentage reduction from May 4 to May 17 was 59% and from May 18 to May 31, it was 49%.“However, even after an increase in NO2, the concentration of the pollutant was well within permissible limits in all four cities where SAFAR monitors air quality,” said Beig.Mumbai witnessed 10 rainy days during the study period while Delhi, Ahmedabad, and Pune had eight rainy days each. This led to the reduction in PM 2.5 — breathable particulate matter of 2.5 micron size or smaller that can cause health ailments — in all four cities. Pune recorded the highest decline (40%), followed by Mumbai (35%), Ahmedabad (20%) and Delhi (5%). “The first two weeks of the unlock period were marked by rainy days which washed away particulate pollutants. However, the prolonged lockdown also helps in reducing background levels (when human-induced sources are minimal), which will take some time to return to earlier levels,” said Beig.On Thursday, the air quality index (AQI) for Mumbai was 18 during the day and fell to 17 in the evening, which is the lowest of this year, said SAFAR. “Intermittent showers will allow PM levels to fall to record low levels in coming days unless there is a prolonged dry spell. Overall, good to satisfactory category is expected to continue during monsoon for all four cities,” said Beig.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/vehicular-pollution-60-up-in-mumbai-after-lockdown-curbs-relaxed-safar/story-3zO3fq1HfdTyKshgO8gTBJ.html

The injured man, identified as Sadiq Inayat Khan, was helping a relative get a bail after he was arrested for attacking a man who assaulted him not wearing a face mask in a public place.According to police, a few days prior to the shooting, Khan’s relative Salim Siddiqui had got into an altercation with one Bunty Rana outside a public toilet. “Rana had confronted Siddiqui for not wearing a face mask. After a heated argument, Rana had slapped Siddiqui. Later, Siddiqui, along with his accomplices, attacked Rana with swords and knives, leaving him severely injured. Siddiqui was later arrested by the police,” said an officer from Tilak Nagar police station.“Rana’s brother Navneet wanted to exact revenge and decided to attack Khan who was helping Siddiqui with the bail procedure,” said Sushil Kamble, senior inspector of Tilak Nagar police station.Around 4am on Thursday, Navneet and three of his associates, Samed Tolkar, Yasin Ansari and one Rounak went to Khan’s house and challenged him to come out and face them.

19-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admnistration mulls imposing mandatory home-quarantine on incoming visitors||With rising instances of people with travel history testing positive for coronavirus, the UT administration is mulling enforcing mandatory home-quarantine for visitors coming to the city, along with penalty for violators not following the directions.In the last 10 days, nearly 50% of the positive cases were people with travel history or their contacts.Expressing concern on the issue, Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore in the daily review meeting directed the principal secretary health to examine the proposal of making home-quarantine mandatory, instead of simply asking people to self-quarantine. This will discourage the visitors coming from outside from roaming around in different parts of the city unnecessarily, he said.In line with the central guidelines, the current advisory issued by the administration only asks for self-quarantine, without specifying the location. Only international fliers have to mandatorily quarantine for a specific period at a specific location.UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said the possibility of sending violators into institutional quarantine will be explored. “With open inter-state movement of people, there is a concern that Covid-19 cases from high incidence areas like Delhi will scatter to areas with less number of cases like Chandigarh. In the past week, an increasing number of visitors have tested positive. The aim of introducing self-home-quarantine is to confine them to their homes and restrict their movement.”NOT ENOUGH TESTING IN UTWhile Punjab has made quarantine mandatory for domestic fliers, no such mandatory condition applies on domestic fliers coming into Chandigarh. Similarly, unlike in Panchkula where all visitors from high-incidence areas like Delhi are being tested, in Chandigarh only those entering the city through cars are being screened, that too randomly.In this regard, Badnore directed the director general of police (DGP) to ensure greater checking at border points, and to check that only authorised persons, who have registered themselves online for entry into Chandigarh, are allowed to enter.UT has made it mandatory for visitors to register themselves on the UT’s official website before entering the city. The self-generated form has to be kept with oneself for the police to check.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admnistration-mulls-imposing-mandatory-home-quarantine-on-incoming-visitors/story-v3KvTbcZ8xzn5POCfBGA4N.html
19-06-2020||Mumbai||Law student from Mumbai writes to HC chief justice seeking clarity over exams||A fourth-year student of Government Law College, Churchgate, approached the chief justice of the Bombay high court (HC), seeking clarity over the status of exams for law students. The student, Samarvir Singh, said he approached the chief justice because the directives by the Maharashtra government and the Bar Council of India (BCI) over the exams are contradictory. Last month, Maharashtra minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant announced that all students, except those pursuing their final-year courses, will be promoted to the next class on the basis of their performance in the previous semester as well as in the internal exams of the current semester. However, BCI in a circular dated June 9, announced that all promoted students will be declared ‘pass’ only if they appear for their final exam of the current semester in the next semester and directed colleges to hold an exam for the current semester in the next academic year.“It is clarified that after reopening of colleges/universities, the universities shall conduct the end semester examination with respect to the year from which they have been promoted, within a reasonable period of time...in case they are unable to pass/clear any paper from the end semester, they shall have to clear the same before they are granted the degree,” stated the BCI release.Students are now worried that even if the state allows them to clear the current academic year based on gradation formula, BCI will not accept their degree.“Experimenting with online examinations with final-year students may impact their grades adversely. Online examinations will act against the interest of underprivileged students. We, therefore, stand by the decision of the state government to cancel examinations and demand the scrapping of exams for final-year students also. BCI conducts a qualifying examination [AIBE[ for registration, and hence missing out on one the end-semester examination won’t degrade the quality of the profession. We want a decision to be taken immediately as many students might lose out on their jobs or a full academic year while applying for further studies,” said Singh, adding that by approaching the judiciary, he hopes to bring clarity to all law students across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/law-student-from-mumbai-writes-to-hc-chief-justice-seeking-clarity-over-exams/story-9yqKnJuKJKuJbp8CSPjACP.html

19-06-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government asks housing societies not to impose unnecessary restrictions||The state has appealed to cooperative housing societies asking them not to impose unnecessary restrictions in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.State minister for cooperation Balasaheb Patil said managing committees of housing societies should not impose curbs on the entry of maids in the homes of elderly residents or restrict the movement of residents who go to work. He also said that those supplying milk and vegetables to the societies should be given easy access. Patil said all societies need to adhere to the guidelines issued by the state and Centre. During the Covid-19 lockdown, many societies had stopped their domestic helps from entering the premises and imposed curbs on the entry of outside articles as well as on the movement of their residents. Despite many restrictions being lifted, several societies have continued to impose restrictions, owing to which residents are finding it difficult to go to offices and for other work. Many society federations have asked the government to intervene and rein in the management committee members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-asks-housing-societies-not-to-impose-unnecessary-restrictions/story-ZkQ8XdiAST2lOC5QJWpznN.html

There are 15 children, including a three-year-old girl from Sector 10 in Airoli and another three-year-old girl from Sector 12 D in Kopar Khairane amongst the positive patients on Thursday,” said an NMMC official.Along with NMMC, a surge of cases was witnessed in Panvel, where 51 Covid-19 cases reported. The total case count in Panvel is now 1,129, with two new deaths reported on Thursday, taking the toll to 52.The two deaths include a 44-year-old resident of Sector 5 in Kalamboli who suffered from high blood pressure and diabetes. The second victim, from Kalamboli’s Sector 11 was a 69-year-old diabetes patient.After testing positive earlier, 32 patients tested negative in subsequent tests and were discharged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/202-new-cases-in-navi-mumbai-9-deaths/story-t2fEXflTFK6giMhSijBMRP.html

The CM also urged mandals not to organise processions and gatherings. The chief minister’s office said that mandals have agreed to comply with the state’s request.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, home minister Anil Deshmukh, state cabinet ministers Satej Patil and Shambhuraj Desai, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar, chief secretary Ajoy Mehta, municipal commissioner IS Chahal, Maharashtra’s director general of police Subodh Jaiswal, Mumbai Police commissioner Parambir Singh, and representatives of Ganesh mandals and idol makers across Maharashtra were present for the video meeting.CM told representatives of mandals to decide the guidelines for a simple and safe celebration. “We are restarting Maharashtra and taking each step very carefully. We will not compromise on tradition, but we have to keep our social responsibility in mind,” said Thackeray, according to a press note from the CM’s office.Sudhir Salvi, secretary of Lalbaugcha Raja Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal, one of the biggest mandals in the city, said, “We have received instructions from the chief minister. Now we will define the guidelines after a meeting with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).

19-06-2020||Mumbai||Over 150 Covid-19 patients underwent dialysis at Nair Hospital||BYL Nair Hospital at Mumbai Central has created a record of sorts by providing dialysis to 160 patients infected with the novel coronavirus, since April 18. The dedicated Covid-19 hospital has run over 1,000 dialysis sessions on Covid-19 patients with kidney ailments daily.Dialysis is a life-saving procedure through which excess water, solutes, and toxins are removed artificially from the blood of patients whose kidneys can no longer perform these functions naturally. This is referred to as renal replacement therapy. A patient with kidney ailments needs to undergo dialysis thrice a week. Due to low immunity, these patients are most vulnerable to Sars-Cov-2— the virus that causes Covid-19.“From the time of the admission, Covid-19 patients with kidney ailments undergo dialysis on alternate days until they get discharged. We have nine machines that run round-the-clock in three shifts,” said Dr Kalpana Mehta, head of department (nephrology), at the hospital.The hospital performs around 1,083 dialysis sessions on Covid-19 patients daily.The dialysis unit functions as a part of the hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU), which is being monitored regularly. “After every patient undergoes his/her dialysis, we have to sanitise the surfaces of the chairs, tables, and floor before starting the next session,” said Mehta. “All medicos including class-IV employees are given safety gear,” she added.To date, three staffers, including two resident doctors from the dialysis unit, have contracted Covid-19. Having recovered, they have resumed work. The hospital’s nephrology department is also assisting the dialysis unit at SevenHills Hospital, Marol, another dedicated Covid-19 hospital.Dr Mohan Joshi, in-charge of SevenHills Hospital, said, “Covid-19 infected patients need specific dialysis machines to avoid any possible spread of infection to other uninfected people. On a daily basis, more than 50 patients undergo dialysis at our hospital.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/over-150-covid-19-patients-underwent-dialysis-at-nair-hospital/story-rXuhIK9kQv3hAbNXxijjFM.html
19-06-2020||Mumbai||Covid treatment: BMC using dexamethasone||While initial results from a clinical study conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) has shown the steroid dexamethasone reduces mortality in patients severely afflicted by Covid-19, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has recorded faster recovery by administering the drug along with another alternative steroid, methylprednisolone. However, doctors have cautioned there could be side effects to this treatment for those with comorbodity.“We are already administering methylprednisolone to Covid-19 patients since April and the response is quite promising. Along with it, we have recently started using dexamethasone but are yet to decide if we want to include it in the treatment protocol as mandatory medication,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer, BMC.Earlier this week, dexamethasone emerged as a potentially effective treatment for critically-ill patients of Covid-19 after a group of scientists from the UK reported that a trial conducted among 2,100 Covid-19 patients had shown the steroid reduced deaths of patients on ventilators by one-third and of patients on oxygen by one-fifth. On Wednesday, the World Health Organisation acknowledged these findings.Some civic-run hospitals have already been administering steroids as treatment to Covid-19 patients. Dexamethasone belongs to the same group of steroids as methylprednisolone, which doctors at BYL Nair Hospital are using to treat to their Covid-19 patients. “We have around 1,000 patients and we administer around 2,000 injections every day. The result has been quite promising,” said Dr Mohan Joshi, in-charge of the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital. “Both drugs [dexamethasone and methylprednisolone] are effective in treating patients. But as the study has shown that dexamethasone is more effective, we will suggest that the steroid be included in treating critical patients,” he said.Steroids have shown to be effective medication to tackle Covid-19 and reduce complications and severity in critically-ill patients. “We already have methylprednisolone in the Covid-19 treatment guidelines. The drugs are readily usable and cheap. In India, we use them in pneumonia cases. Dexamethasone may be a good choice as it is supported by a large trial and is a cost-effective drug,” said Dr Avinash Supe, former dean of King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital and part of BMC’s Covid-19 death committee.However, doctors have warned against unregulated usage of steroids among patients with Covid-19, especially those who are diabetic. Dexamethasone and methylprednisolone come under the type of steroids that significantly increase blood glucose levels in those with diabetes. “Patients should never consume these steroids without the supervision of doctors. It can be life threatening and cause severe damage,” said Dr Joshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-treatment-bmc-using-dexamethasone/story-tq5UffFoUcZzo0ynMYns4J.html
19-06-2020||Mumbai||BMC rule that private labs can’t inform patients about positive test reports irks IMA||Days after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) changed the rules of testing for Covid-19, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has criticised the civic body for confusing doctors and delaying treatment of coronavirus patients.On June 13, BMC issued a circular which stated that no positive test report will be shared by the laboratory directly with the patient. “Laboratory will share the report with MCGM (Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai) and MCGM in return will share it with the patients,” the circular mentioned.This has created dissatisfaction among doctors as they alleged that it is leading to delays in the treatment of Covid-19 patients. “Earlier, private labs used to inform BMC along with patients on the phone. But now, as the civic body is responsible for informing positive patients, it often takes two to three days, which delays their treatment time,” said a senior doctor from BYL Nair Hospital.“Due to the wait without treatment, oxygen saturation among patients is falling drastically, leading to their death within a few hours of admission,” said the doctor.Highlighting the same complaint, IMA on Thursday issued a letter stating, “Because of the new rule, the patients come to know about the result of the test after three to four days, and during this time their symptoms may aggravate and may become serious.”IMA has also criticised BMC for repeatedly changing their testing rules, which is confusing doctors. Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president of IMA, Maharashtra, said, “Doctors are living in fear. Every week, the rules are being changed. And it is very troublesome to regularly keep updated with the changing protocols with fake documents circulating on social media. If unknowingly they violate any rule, BMC will take action against them.”Despite repeated calls, additional civic commissioner Suresh Kakani did not respond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-rule-that-private-labs-can-t-inform-patients-about-positive-test-reports-irks-ima/story-tMyKOCXwxn3QlmCvtc3y1O.html

19-06-2020||Mumbai||Over 15,000 migrant workers coming back to state daily, says state home minister Deshmukh||More than 15,000 migrant workers are returning to the state daily after leaving it during the coronavirus-enforced lockdown and the number is expected to rise, said Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Thursday.“As a lockdown was imposed to fight the coronavirus outbreak, a large number of migrant workers went back to their respective states. Since the state government has eased restrictions, following which business and industrial units have started their operations, migrant workers have also started returning. 15,000-16,000 workers are coming back to the state daily,” Deshmukh said.He further said the state government gets a list of workers who are coming back from their respective states. “Based on that, we make a list along with their address, screen them with thermal devices and asked them to stay at home for 14 days after inking them with ‘home quarantine’ stamps,” Deshmukh said.Till the first week of June, the state government had sent around 18 lakh migrant workers back to their respective states, such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Karnataka, Chhatisgarh, Assam, Jammu, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh, Manipur, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Telangana, Tripura and Mizoram. Of them, around 12 lakh workers returned to their home states through 826 Shramik trains and around 5.38 lakh workers were sent back with the help of 44,106 trips of State Transport (ST) buses.Maharashtra has so far reopened over 60,000 industries since relaxations from lockdown were granted and have employed close to 15 lakh people in these units.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/over-15-000-migrant-workers-coming-back-to-state-daily-says-state-home-minister-deshmukh/story-9CBOCY0Dz6D9nMsrY71K9H.html
19-06-2020||Mumbai||Maha sees sharpest 1-day spike of 3,752 Covid cases||Maharashtra on Thursday recorded 3,752 Covid-19 cases, its highest single-day jump, taking the tally to 1,20,504, including 62,875 in Mumbai.With the addition of 100 deaths, the state toll has reached 5,751, including 3,311 fatalities in Mumbai.Of the 100 deaths reported on Thursday, 99 are from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), including 67 in Mumbai, 27 Bhiwandi and four in Thane. One death each was registered in Vasai-Virar and Nagpur city. Maharashtra saw more than 2,000 Covid-19 cases a day for the past 31 days, accounting for 70.91% of its total, as state authorities and experts attribute the rise to the easing of lockdown restrictions. A total of 75,108 cases or 65.44% of the state’s tally have been reported after most areas were exempted from lockdown curbs from May 22. Under its Mission Begin Again — a staggered plan to lift curbs — the state government started to roll out major relaxations, even in red zones. After allowing physical activities such as running, jogging and cycling from June 3, shops and commercial establishments were allowed to be open on alternate days from June 5. From June 8, private offices opened with 10% (or 10 persons, whichever is greater) of the capacity. The two weeks of unlocking have seen 48,204 cases.Before these relaxations, the state had exempted major part of its population from red-zone restrictions from May 22. From 14 districts with a population of 6.56 crore, the restrictions were lowered to just 3.15 crore in 19 municipal corporations covering only urban parts.The state’s projection of the case curve reaching a plateau and then flattening has failed time and again with the authorities now expecting the middle of monsoon to see the beginning of a downward trend. “The surge in cases after the relaxations of lockdown curbs was expected and we were prepared for it. Although the number of cases is rising across the state, we have been able to keep the containment well below various projections for Mumbai and even for the state. Our projections related to the plateau and flattening of the curve have not been met. We have been able to stabilise the curve in Mumbai and other cities with high infection, but it spread rapidly in a few other districts of the state,” said a state official, who is privy to the brainstorming and strategies chalked out combat the virus.After a sudden jump of 1,328 fatalities, as a result of reconciliation of data on Tuesday, the state case fatality rate has risen to 4.77%, much above the national rate. The state government, however, said that its recovery rate improved to 50.49% after 60,838 patients recovered. The state health department has also said that the doubling rate of cases has improved to 25.9 days on June 16, from 3.5 days on March 31 and 10.2 days on April 30 and 20.1 days on May 31. The weekly growth rate of cases has been 3% on June 16, from 12%, 7% and 4% on March 31, April 30 and May 31 respectively. State has so far conducted 717, 683 tests with a positivity rate of 16.93%. State has 101 testing laboratories, including 43 from private sector. 5,81,650 people are home quarantine in the state. State authorities are wary of a rise in cases in the next two-three weeks owing to monsoon- related ailments and increased risk of infection. “We have been concentrating on new hotspots that have come up elsewhere in the state. Tracing , testing and treatment have been the key formula to contain the spread of the virus. It is being implemented in these districts too. The figures in Mumbai have been stabilised and we now expect to reach the plateau at the state level by mid-July, ” said state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate.Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, public health consultant, said that the opening up of activities has led to a rise in cases and striking a balance between the lockdown and unlocking was inevitable. “The rise after the restarting of activities was expected, but it is now for people to understand how to live with the virus without getting infected. People have been following the norms of social distancing and physical contacts; it should be rigorously followed even in future. With the density of population in India, we need to take extra precautions than any other country,” he said.Mumbai accounted for 63.73% of the daily state cases on May 14, 56.47% on May 28, which dropped to 41.1% on June 17. However, a few districts such as Aurangabad, Jalagaon and Solapur saw a surge in cases and even in the case fatality rate (CFR). Against the state’s mortality rate of 4.84%, Solapur, Jalgaon and Aurangabad have reported 9.25%, 10.12% and 5.68% respectively, as per the deaths recorded till Wednesday. The recovery rate in these districts was 35.28%, 45.45% and 55.88%, against the state rate of 50.68% till Monday evening.Bhushan Gagarani, principal secretary, state government, said the districts with high fatality rate have been asked to do better case management. “One of the reasons for the high mortality rate in Solapur is the high number of beedi workers who suffer from lung ailments. In Jalgaon, we have issues with health infrastructure. These districts have been asked for better case management to reduce the fatality rate,” he said.Jalgaon collector Avinash Dhakne, who was transferred on Thursday, said that the death rate in the district was high because of fewer tests in the district. “While the state rate of tests is 4,800 per million, it is just 2,000 per million in Jalgaon. We have no facility for testing, which forced us to send our samples to private labs. We conducted more than 50 lakh tests in private laboratories. We have changed our strategy and started focusing on the vulnerable groups of citizens, especially in densely populated areas,” he said. Dhakne said that even the surveys conducted by ICMR have found the fatality rate was not too high, compared to the population of the district. He also added that the spread of the virus was owing to people coming in from other cities like Mumbai, Pune and due to the high footfall of migrant workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-sees-sharpest-1-day-spike-of-3-752-covid-cases/story-N0yqv7pwND180LwOWC1fwO.html
19-06-2020||Mumbai||CM installed, Uddhav to address cadre on Sena’s new challenges||In a packed hall at the Nesco exhibition centre in Goregaon on June 19, 2018, the 52nd foundation day event of the Shiv Sena, party chief Uddhav Thackeray had told party workers that the next chief minister would be from the Shiv Sena. In 2019, on the 53rd foundation day, an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana reiterated the statement. A few months later, after a big political shift in Maharashtra, it came true – not just a Sena leader, but Uddhav Thackeray took over the reins of the state government.While the party has cancelled its annual celebration in view of the Covid-19 outbreak, Thackeray is expected to address the cadre via video conference on the 54th foundation day of the Sena on Friday. Even as the Sena has come to power by forming an alliance with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) to keep the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) out, political observers feel the real test for the Thackeray-led party would be the Mumbai civic polls, strengthening the party cadre and redefining the political identity.Political analyst Surendra Jondhale said the Sena cadre, which is known to be on the ground, is not seen much during the Covid-19 situation. “The Sena needs to strengthen the cadre. Usually, a party takes a back seat once it is in power. In the past few months, after it snapped ties and formed the government with the Congress-NCP, the Sena is not visible on the ground. The goodwill that Thackeray earned while handling Covid-19 will not help in future elections,” Jondhale said.Sena leaders said these are their early days in the government and they have not got a chance to work for people. Besides, the Sena is actively helping families of patients during the pandemic in Mumbai, they said.Political observers feel the Sena, which has allied with parties with different ideologies, could stand to lose its follower base. “The Sena needs to redefine its politics and programme. By joining hands with the Congress and NCP, the Sena will not be able to go back to its old agendas. It can’t get complacent after coming to power, because the BJP will get more aggressive once Covid-19 situation ends,” said Jondhale.However, Sena Lok Sabha MP Arvind Sawant dismissed the notion. “What is wrong with Hindutva ideology? Our Hindutva is far more secular than people who talk about secularism. Besides, we don’t have political programmes; we only have social goals. Power is an instrument to achieve these social goals,” he said.Sawant, who resigned as the Union minister last year, said the Sena had no “greed for power” and it snapped the alliance with the BJP to teach them a “lesson”. “If you look at it [the MVA government] as a political realignment, it is a lesson for the other states as well. If a party is behaving arrogantly, the Opposition can come together to form the government. Almost in all elections, no party gets 51% votes. The Opposition is always in majority. They are not in power only because they are not united. They [the BJP] use all regional parties, not just us, as a ladder. The moment they climb it, they throw it out. We believe in Hindutva, but we are not slaves. The Sena was more than equal in that partnership. We kept sacrificing for the sake of the country and Hindutva. It didn’t mean they could finish us,” Sawant said.Jondhale said the next three months would be crucial for the Sena within the government and outside. The government, under Uddhav Thackeray, will have to take key policy decisions for the economy, education and health of the state. According to him, the party will be able to take credit for these decisions. It would otherwise face a tough competition from the NCP, which is skilled at milking situations for political advantage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-installed-uddhav-to-address-cadre-on-sena-s-new-challenges/story-vPT6A7WvvBui6c0gJqrQAL.html
19-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai receives heavy rain and plaints of waterlogging||There were intermittent spells of intense showers across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) on Thursday, which led to temperatures dropping to normal and reports of waterlogging in the city. Mumbai and its suburbs can expect intermittent rain with heavy showers in isolated areas over the next 24 hours, and moderate rain over 48 hours.Between 8.30am and 8.30pm on Thursday, Santacruz weather station, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded 39.2 millimetres (mm) while Colaba, representing south Mumbai, recorded 38.6mm of rain. Thane recorded 64mm in the same duration. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) classifies 35.6mm to 64.4mm as rather heavy rain, and 64.5mm to 124.4mm as heavy rain.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) recorded average rainfall of 37.43mm in the island city, 34.04mm in the western suburbs and 52.6mm in the eastern suburbs between 8am to 6pm on Thursday. As per BMC’s monsoon report, 18 tree collapses and five incidents of short circuit were reported in the city. No injuries were reported in any of them.BMC’s disaster management cell said there was no waterlogging and no traffic had to be diverted because of the rain. However, citizens reported waterlogging in a number of areas across MMR, including Chembur’s Amar Mahal, parts of Sion Koliwada, some areas in Thane and near APMC market of Vashi in Navi Mumbai.Three people sustained minor injuries when ground-plus-two storey structure collapsed in a chawl in Jogeshwari. Sakira Shaikh (22), Tauseef Shaikh (28) and Fatima Qureshi (60) were taken to RN Cooper Hospital, where they were treated and later discharged. Another ground-plus-three storey house collapsed in Kurla (West). No injury was reported.On social media, there were videos claiming leakage from the walls of a Covid-19 care facility in Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) because of rainfall, but BMC clarified in a press statement that the leakage was caused by a faulty tap, which has been fixed.According to IMD, heavy rain is predicted for MMR over the next 24 hours. “A cloud patch near Mumbai over the Arabian Sea is likely to pave the way for overnight rain with intermittent heavy spells between Thursday night and early Friday morning. Lower level westerly winds from sea to land will help the cloud patch move over the city,” said KS Hosalikar deputy director general, western region, IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-receives-heavy-rain-and-plaints-of-waterlogging/story-dCIH6ndYEDO2m4f14dFqnK.html
19-06-2020||Delhi||Cost of all Covid tests in Delhi capped at Rs 2,400||Basing on the report by a Central government committee that recommended reducing the price of only government collected Covid-19 test samples to Rs 2,400, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Thursday went a step ahead and approved lowering the rates for all Covid-19 tests, including by private firms. In effect, all Covid-19 tests, whether from a government or private centre in Delhi, will now cost Rs 2,400. The decision, which came into effect on Thursday itself, was taken in a DDMA meeting chaired by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, and attended by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, revenue minister Kailash Gahlot and other top officials from the Delhi Police, administration and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).Documents presented in the meeting, seen by HT, showed that the expert panel constituted by Union home minister Amit Shah on June 14 under the chairmanship of NITI Aayog member Dr Vinod K Paul did not recommend revising the prices for tests conducted solely by private labs in Delhi. The panel only recommended reducing the rates of for the samples collected by the government for private labs.Until now, the cost of a Covid-19 test was Rs 4,500 if the private labs collected the sample and used their own kits, Rs 3,500 if the government collected the samples and the private labs used their kits to test it; and Rs 2,200 if the government collected the sample and provided the test kit as well. While the government paid these charges to the private labs, residents across Delhi were charged a flat rate of Rs 4,500.The Central government panel’s recommendation was limited to the second category.“After detailed discussions and taking all factors into account, it was decided to fix a rate of Rs 2,400 for each RT-PCR test applicable to specimens provided by the government (panel). The specimens will be collected by the government facility on its own. The cost is all-inclusive of: a) the cost involved in pick-up and transportation of samples, documentation and reporting b) includes GST/Taxes is any,” read the document that was presented in the DDMA meeting on Thursday. Later in the evening, Delhi’s principal health secretary issued the order revising the testing rates with immediate effect. The order stated that the rates recommended are the maximum chargeable for samples collected by any facility, whether government or private.Members of the committee could not be reached for comment on Thursday.In a press statement issued by the Union ministry of home affairs on Thursday, the ministry said, “The expert committee under the chairmanship of NITI Aayog Member Dr V.K Paul has fixed a price of Rs. 2,400 for COVID-19 tests.”Senior government officials present in the DDMA meeting said key members of the authority were of the opinion that the committee’s recommendations be accepted as it is.“With the DDMA’s decision, now even those who get Covid tests done on their own from private labs will be charged Rs 2,400 instead of Rs 4,500 — a point the Central government panel stayed silent on. In the meeting, the chief minister insisted that tests from private labs are very expensive for the common person. While there was some reluctance among a few members initially, a price of Rs 2,800 per test was proposed in the discussions,” said an official present in the meeting.However, on the CM’s insistence and with the L-G’s approval, it was decided that the price will be reduced to Rs 2,400 for all categories,” the official saidIn the meeting, the L-G directed the Delhi health department to ensure that the labs adhere to general quality standards and provide robust patient feedback. He also asked that a grievance redressal system be set up for those who get tested as well as those seeking a test.“It was also informed that antigen detection tests have commenced with effect from today at about 169 locations with 341 teams. ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research] has already conducted training for the concerned health professionals. During the antigen detection tests, all social distancing norms will be observed. The medical teams at the centres will ensure that all Covid positive cases should be followed up for treatment as per the guidelines and protocol issued by the ICMR,” read a statement issued by the L-G’s office later in the day.Delhi divisional commissioner Sanjiv Khirwar said, till 3pm on Thursday, 4,500 antigen tests were conducted across the city. “The DDMA also approved the format of the Covid-free certificates to be issued by hospitals for patients who have recovered,” Khirwar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cost-of-all-covid-tests-in-capital-capped-at-2-400/story-1SK3mhFKdIwc0EQOSU9KMI.html
19-06-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal inspects 10k-bed Chhatarpur Covid-19 facility||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday visited the Radhasoami Satsang Beas in south Delhi’s Chhatarpur, where the government is setting up a makeshift Covid-19 health care facility with 10,000 beds over an area big enough to cover 20 football fields.For this facility, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has urged the central government to allow the Army and central security forces to provide around 2,000 health care officials, largely including doctors and nurses, said a senior government official who did not wish to be identified.“This 10,000-bed facility should be ready for admission of Covid patients by the first week of July. It will primarily cater to patients with mild or no symptoms who cannot be assigned home quarantine for some reason and may need medical intervention. It will be our biggest dedicated Covid health centre,” Kejriwal said during his visit to the premises, where he was accompanied by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia.He said, “By June 30, we shall have 15,000 hospital beds available and the number will go up to 30,000 by July 15. The progress in the health care augmentation exercise is at par with what was planned. Right now, we are focussing more on augmenting ICU beds in hospitals for the coming days.”On Sunday, Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, who heads the DDMA, had visited the site and directed the district administration to file a feasibility report.A senior official in the revenue department said, the facility – set up on a field that measures around 11.90 lakh square feet — would operate in two shifts and it would need at least 600 doctors and 1,200 nurses, other than workers engaged in waste management, sanitation employees, guards, workers involved in help desks and other back-end operations.The government is also working on a centralised air conditioning system for the facility, which will be treated like 20 hospitals of 500 bed each, having enclosures that accommodate 100 beds each, said a senior revenue department official, citing the feasibility report filed by the district administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-inspects-10-000-bed-facility-at-satsang-premises/story-5EcSnmVxixp0p03n9NmZUP.html

But a second test was conducted on Wednesday to rule out a false negative, after which Jain tested positive.Senior government officials on Thursday said Jain is still on oxygen support at Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital — a dedicated Covid-19 facility under the Delhi government.Sisodia, who is already in charge of the finance, education and tourism and culture portfolios among others, will now take additional charge of ministries currently under Jain — such as health and industries, till he recovers and rejoins office, a senior official in the chief minister’s office said.Health department officials said Jain’s contacts are being traced, health department officials said.Jain had on Sunday morning attended the meeting chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah along with Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Sisodia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sisodia-takes-addl-charge-of-jain-s-portfolios-including-health/story-FAxTDHM4r0lGyS8eDewVGN.html
19-06-2020||Delhi||Private labs not being used optimally: Delhi High Court||The Delhi High Court on Thursday said that it is “most unacceptable” that the testing facilities of the private laboratories are not being used to their optimum capacity for diagnosing Covid-19, though they have not expressed any hesitation in ramping up the number of testing.A bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad also said that with the cases rising up to 47,102 as of Wednesday, the committee constituted by the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal to advise and assist the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), should immediately look into the concerns raised by the various private labs and also ramp up testing in the national capital.The court’s remarks came while hearing a plea by advocate Sanjeev Sharma who contended that there have been several instances where non-Covid patients needing surgery or other procedures were asked to undergo testing before that, but the hospital concerned did not conduct the Covid test since they don’t have the government permission.Advocate Satyakam, the additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, informed the court that the number of public laboratories equipped to undertake COVID-19 tests has been increased from 17 to 18 and for the private laboratories, from 23 to 25 in number. He also said that both public and private sector laboratories have now been ramped up to collectively undertake 10,700 tests per day, as against the previous capacity of 8,600 tests per day.“Besides, as recommended by the ICMR, on June 14, Delhi is going to undertake point of care rapid antigen detection test that will quickly augment testing capacity in various containment zones and health facilities,” the Delhi government said.However, on a specific enquiry from the court, as to whether the number of increased testing mentioned in the affidavit filed in the court, the counsel said that he does not have the exact numbers.Following this, the court said that as per the updated information on the website of Delhi government, only a maximum of 7,000 tests are being conducted daily, which means that the available capacity of 3,700 is not being utilised, “which is most unacceptable”.“The conclusion is that the testing facilities of the private laboratories are not being used to their optimum capacity, though they have not expressed any hesitation in ramping up the number of testing,” it said.The submissions by the Delhi government show that the testing capacity in Delhi has gone up by 2,100 tests a day. The government had planned to double Covid-19 testing in the city within two days after a meeting with the Union home minister Amit Shah of Monday. It also rolled out antigen testing in 169 centres across the city on Thursday in an effort to ramp up testing for the viral infection. On Thursday, advocate Rakesh Malhotra, counsel for the petitioner, informed the court that out of 23 private labs authorized for the testing of Covid-19, 12 have filed replies with some of them highlighting the problems faced by them in conducting tests.One of the issues flagged by the private laboratories is that they are being made to undertake a cumbersome process of contemporaneously uploading patient registration forms on the various apps and portals. They stated that these require engaging several data entry operators so that the information can be provided to multiple government agencies on a daily basis, thereby wasting valuable time and diverting their energies from the testing process. The labs also said that they are being told to define patient categories through the phlebotomists who are required to go on-site to collect the samples when they are not equipped or trained for it. They also contended that for being authorized to collect samples, all the phlebotomists are required to be registered in the given districts and there is a duplication in the said process thereby hindering the work of collecting the samples and curtailing the number of Phlebotomists who would otherwise be available to collect the samples. It had also said that the number of the testing kits vendors identified by the Delhi Government, may be increased in proportion to the tests required to be undertaken.Following this, the court said that the committee constituted by the L-G to advise the DDMA can look into the grievances and directed the Delhi government to file the report by the next date of hearing.The matter would be now heard on June 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/testing-capacity-of-pvt-labs-should-be-used-to-the-optimum-hc-tells-delhi-govt/story-1czH9DEbtSRTRGnlqRwleN.html
19-06-2020||Delhi||Private labs say lower test price may reduce testing capacity, lead to losses||The capping of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) testing price at Rs 2,400 may lead to fewer samples being tested at private labs because it does not cover the costs, owners of private labs said on Thursday, requesting anonymity. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Thursday approved capping of the rates for all Covid-19 tests, including by private firms at Rs 2,400. An expert panel constituted by Union home minister Amit Shah on June 14 did not recommend revising the prices for tests conducted by private labs in Delhi. It only recommended reducing the rates of for the samples collected by the government for private labs.Until now, the cost of a Covid-19 test was Rs 4,500 if the private labs collected the sample and used their own kits, Rs 3,500 if the government collected the samples and the private labs used their kits to test it; and Rs 2,200 if the government collected the sample and provided the test kit as well. “Two important things happened today. Covid-19 testing rates in Delhi have been reduced to Rs 2,400 and rapid-antigen testing has started. I hope people won’t face any problem in getting themselves tested now,” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet.Owners of the private laboratories said that the price fixed by the government would not cover their money spent on collection of samples from door-to-door, transportation and the protective gear, etc. “It is not just the cost of the process of testing, lifting samples from door-to-door incurs ancillary costs that inflates the overall testing price. We could have managed the tests for government collected samples in Rs 2,400, since we won’t have to spend on a personal protection equipment, viral transport medium, swab sticks and transportation. But going home-to-home for collecting samples, spending on manpower and transport and providing protective gear cannot be managed for the same price,” said one of the private lab representatives, requesting anonymity. “These are costs that the government does not seem to have considered while fixing the price. It will be difficult for a lot of us to sustain this price structure, which would obviously affect the number of samples lifted per day for testing in the long run, especially those from home,” the person added.Another laboratory representative agreed that home collection of samples cannot be done for such a low price. He said the will have to consider differential pricing, like the one currently in place in Delhi.“The cost for testing a sample collected by Delhi government is low but for the ones that we collect from the homes we charge Rs 4,500. Going below that will hurt our pocket. Plus, if the government wants us to expand our testing capacity, we need to be able to recover money for the additional machines and manpower,” said the second lab representative.Private hospitals testing Covid samples shared similar concerns.“We are not talking about making profit but we cannot suffer losses. The way prices stand as of now, we are staring at losses. How are we supposed to enhance the testing capacity that everyone seems to be looking at; where is the ability to invest in expensive machinery if there are mounting losses. A gene expert machine testing kit, which is a quicker alternative to RT-PCR testing, costs about Rs 2,350 on discount, then how do you expect the test to be conducted at Rs 2,400. There is a turnaround deadline of 48 hours so at the end we will be forced to drop the number of samples being tested per day,” said a representative for a prominent hospital, requesting anonymity. The Delhi government said the decision was taken to help people who had to pay “exorbitant sums of money for tests and treatment”. “The Delhi government reduced the prices because the people have to pay exorbitant sums to get Covid tests done. Also, when other states have capped it, nothing stops Delhi from doing the same. It is what the Centre and the ICMR also have recommended,” said a Delhi government spokesperson.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Monday recommended use of antigen based testing kits for diagnosis that is likely to bring down the cost of testing. However, hospitals say the kit is not readily available in market yet. “Where are the kits, and what is the price for testing using antigen based kits. There is no clarity even on serology (antibody) test that ICMR also recently recommended. Are we allowed to do those tests? There is utter confusion over it,” said another representative of a prominent hospital in the Capital.“Nobody is going to make losses, so a lot more thought needs to be put into this. You cannot just randomly quote a price. At least allow flexibility in prices for home collection samples so that those who can pay should be allowed to pay. On one hand you want to enhance testing capacity but the prices that are being fixed by the government could actually lead to reduction in capacity,” said representative of a third laboratory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pvt-labs-say-lower-test-price-may-reduce-testing-capacity-lead-to-losses/story-HvHXaKFDkKZGyflNJtNvwI.html
19-06-2020||Chandigarh||Booked by CBI for graft, three Chandigarh cops suspended||Three constables posted at the Maloya police station, including the driver of the station house officer (SHO), were suspended on Thursday after being booked by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for corruption for attempting to implicate Maloya resident Deepak Shani in a false case.CBI also arrested Rajat of Maloya who acted as a ‘middleman’ and demanded money from Shani on behalf of the constables Nasib Khan, Krishan Malik and Shiv, the SHO’s driver, all from the Maloya police station. “On allegations of corruption and registration of corruption case by CBI, all three constables posted at Maloya, have been placed under suspension and sent to Police Lines, Sector 26, Chandigarh,” read a Chandigarh police statement.In his complaint on June 16, Shani accused the three of demanding a bribe of ₹20,000 from him through Rajat and threatened to implicate him under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) if he did not pay up.Shani said initial demand was ₹20,000 on June 15 but later it was settled at ₹14,000.Shani told the CBI that on June 15 he was on an outing with his friends when two policemen approached them. As they carried sticks he panicked and ran home but a little later, an acquaintance, Rajat, came over and took him to the police beat box close by.Assaulted, threats issuedKhan and Malik then allegedly assaulted him in the beat box and accused him of selling drugs. Rajat then asked Shani to pay ₹20,000 to the policemen if he did not want to be implicated and after some negotiations a deal was struck at ₹14,000. Shani alleged that Khan forcibly took ₹4,300 from him, returned ₹300 and directed him to arrange for the rest of the money. On June 16, Shani informed the CBI, which registered an FIR against Rajat with the three constables under section 120 IPC and Prevention of Corruption Act.Bribe referred to as shoesIn recordings provided to CBI which Shani claimed included conversations between the accused, Rajat and Shiv can be heard referring to the bribe amount as jootey (shoes) and Shani as jootey wala ladka (boy with the shoes).Rajat had allegedly told Shiv that Shani had arranged for five pairs of shoes and that other pairs would be handed over later (five pairs being equivalent to ₹5,000).Rajat had previously given CBI the slipThough the CBI had laid a trap on Wednesday night to nab Rajat while Shani handed over ₹5,000 to him, he (Rajat) had, however, managed to escape. He was not so lucky on Thursday, when the law finally caught up with him.Rajat, who also sustained injuries while fleeing, was also tested for Covid-19. He will be presented before the court on Friday.BOX Taint on khakiCases in which men who enforce law broke the rulesNovember 27, 2019 CBI court awarded four-year jail term to former UT sub-inspector Kulwaranjit Singh Cheema, and a three-year sentence to his aide Subhash Chand Dhiman in a 2012 graft caseSeptember 11, 2019 Chandigarh police dismissed a home guard and initiated a probe against two traffic policemen for allegedly seeking ₹500 a bribe for a from man who violated traffic rules near the Hallomajra light point.June 18, 2019 CBI arrested assistant sub inspector Bhupinder Singh, the driver of an assistant transport officer (ATO) of Punjab, for allegedly taking a bribe of ₹20,000 from a truck cleaner.June 11, 2019 CBI had arrested head constable Dalbir Singh, deputed with the proclaimed offender (PO) and summons branch of the UT police in Sarangpur, for taking ₹2,000 from a man facing PO proceedings.

19-06-2020||Delhi||As bodies pile up, private firms transport dead for last rites||Standing under a tree on a hot Thursday afternoon at the Delhi Gate graveyard near ITO in Central Delhi, Ravi Kumar Kashyap, 24, is removing his personal protective equipment (PPE) suit, the fourth he had worn since morning. In similar suits, a group of people nearby were lowering a man’s body about 12 feet deep into the grave. “Thank god the relatives came for the final rites in this case. We can rest for some time. Many times, when people die of Covid-19, their families refuse to touch their bodies. We then have to perform the final rites,” Kashyap said. Kashyap’s employers are contracted by city hospitals to shift bodies from the mortuaries to crematoriums and burial grounds. Since the pandemic intensified in Delhi, bodies had begun piling up and the firms on an average move around six bodies a day, as against three earlier.These workers are required to wear PPE kits at all times while handling the bodies, to prevent infection. Each time they are done handling a body, they would have to dispose it of.But sometimes they would have additional obligations. When relatives shy away from touching the Covid-19 infected body, they would sit with it and perform the final rites according to the dead person’s religion.“The priest tells us to keep some religious items on top of the body, or pour water next to it. Initially, it was weird. You do such things only if your relative or a close one dies, but now we are used to it,” said Rajesh Kishore, 36, who works with an ambulance service in central Delhi.Kashyap said he is glad to have a “dangerous” job at a time when there are not many jobs around and many companies are deducting salaries. Besides him, 10 more people were hired by the firm he is working for in the past month alone.The past few days had been the busiest. Following media reports of bodies piling up in the city’s mortuaries due to delay in Covid-19 test results, relatives refusing to take custody of the body, among others, Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday directed hospitals to dispose of them. On Monday and Tuesday, at least 380 funerals of Covid-19 suspected and confirmed cases were held at different crematoriums and burial grounds, reconciling the backlog of bodies waiting at the city mortuaries. Although the government is yet to document cases when families refused bodies, workers say that in the last four days there were at least 30 such cases. “Yesterday, we buried a body from Ram Manohar Lohia hospital that was kept there for 19 days. The family had left for West Bengal after leaving the body in the mortuary. We tell people that it is safe to handle the bodies after wearing PPE, but they do not want to take a chance. And here we are taking the risk because we have to earn a living. We are happy to work. We hope the government recognises this and helps us with some incentives,” said Tamim, 25, another worker who handles bodies. Handlers at big hospitals and employed by big logistical firms earn about ₹22,000 a month on the job. The others get as little as ₹10,000 a month. As the cases rise in Delhi, these workers say they will demand life insurance cover. According to Delhi government protocols, trained health care workers will have to handle and pack the body and provide a hearse van to carry the body to cremation or burial ground. After burial or cremation, the hearse van has to be properly disinfected. “Ours is the most dangerous job at the moment. If we take a day off, we lose a day’s pay. We handle bodies from 7am to 10pm. The bigger firms have air-conditioned hearse vans while smaller ones, such as the one where I work for, do not. We are told that one company has also given life insurance to their employees. We will also ask for insurance too,” a man, who works with a private hospital in South Delhi, said while wishing not to be identified.Danish S, 34, who works for an ambulance service at RML Hospital said his job was emotionally and physically draining. “We wear this suit from head to toe and stand in the sun the whole day. It is not comfortable at all, “ he said. Most workers who HT spoke to said that in April many of their colleagues had left the job fearing they too would get the virus if they continued. “People need work. With many deaths, the demand for people like us has increased. My friend’s company hired 10 such mortuary workers. Some of our friends who had initially left have also returned now. They have realised that we have to learn to live and work with the virus,” said Danish.Until Thursday afternoon, according to the government, Delhi reported XX cases and XX confirmed deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/helping-the-dead-to-the-other-world/story-rnfxptc6cFucWOApYQCTCM.html
19-06-2020||Chandigarh||Three men who acquired weapons for Sector 33 firing arrested||Chandigarh Police in true Bollywood thriller style on Thursday arrested three persons who provided logistical support to gunmen who opened fire at the Sector 33 bungalow of hotelier and businessman Rakesh Singla to target his younger brother, liquor baron Arvind Singla on May 31.In a dramatic face-off and surrender, Shiva Veeran alias Shiva and Param Dutt alias Lucky were rounded up after police were given a tip-off that two men involved in the case would meet Rajinder Singh, a municipal corporation employee at Maloya to discuss a case of bail. After a naka was set up near the Radha Soami Satsang Beas, Maloya, two men on a motorcycle came from the dumping ground area but on spotting the police tried to flee and skidded. Brandished pistolsThey then brandished pistols but after a heated exchange of words with the policemen put down their weapons on the road and surrendered.One pistol with two magazines, each with seven live cartridges of .32 bore were recovered from Shiva and one pistol with two magazines each with seven live cartridges from Lucky.Apart from acquiring weapons Shiva had also provided shelter to Karan, one of the gunmen who had been arrested. Lucky’s role so far is not clear.Five persons had fired around 17 shots at Singla’s bungalow and police had recovered shells of .9mm and .32 bore pistols from the spot.“The firing was done on instructions of Deepu Banur alias Deepak from Ambala jail. He was making calls on WhatsApp to gangster Lawrence Bishnoi and shooters who committed the crime in Sector-33 Chandigarh,” Nilambari Jagadale, senior superintendent of police (SSP), had said earlier. Deepak’s disclosure led to Sahab’s arrestDeepak, who was brought on production warrants from Ambala to Chandigarh, told police during interrogation that he had provided weapons to the gunmen for the Sector 33 shootout.Speaking to the media on Thursday, Jagadale said, “Deepu had arranged for the weapons for the shooters. He had asked two of his men, Gurpreet alias Goldy and Sunny Ghumana, to take the weapons from one Sahab Singh alias Sabha and provide the same to the shooters.”Police then raided various spots in Banur on Thursday and arrested Sahab who said he had hidden a pistol and ammunition in the forest area in Sector 50 and in front of the Gaushala in Sector 45, Chandigarh. Two pistols and some cartridges had been given to Gurpreet alias Goldy and Sunny Ghumana.Till reports last came in, police had recovered one pistol along with two magazine and 14 live cartridges of .9mm.More details of how the crime were committed will emerge once all three are interrogated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/3-men-who-acquired-weapons-for-sec-33-firing-arrested/story-S3sQG5vrb0JfRdijHyJ38N.html
19-06-2020||City||Union Home Minister favours unified Delhi-NCR to deal with Coronavirus||Ghaziabad:  According to Ghaziabad officials who attended the meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah, via video, along with senior officials of Delhi and areas of the National Capital Region (NCR) for a review of the fight against Covid-19 in the region, the minister did not favour restricting borders movement between states across the NCR“The home minister said that NCR should be treated as a single unit due to inter connectivity. He further said that interstate border regulation is not practical and he sort of discouraged border restrictions,” said an officer from Ghaziabad district administration, asking not to be identified.The Ghaziabad administration on April 22 had imposed restrictions at its borders citing rising number of Covid-19 cases in the district, in wake of people travelling to and from DelhiAdditional restrictions were put in place on May 27. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on June 1 also announced closure of borders of the National Capital for a week and lifted restrictions on June 7.Similar restrictions are in place at the Noida-Delhi borders.In June, a three-Judge bench of the Supreme Court had asked the Centre to convene a meeting of officials from the three states across which national capital region spans – Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh – within a week and come up with a common portal to facilitate interstate travel such as the one between Delhi and Noida or Delhi and Gurugram.The UP government on Friday, during hearing on a petition, informed the apex court restrictions between UP and Delhi will continue. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday had also suggested a uniform policy for the NCR to effectively check Covid-19 , although he batted for sealing borders for the time being. The CM had made these suggestions in a video conference during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s virtual meeting with chief ministers on Wednesday. “The Union home minister also said rates have been decided if any private hospital wishes to operate as a Covid treatment facility in NCR and that state governments should consider this. A committee has decided the rates and these will be circulated to all. He also asked that assessment of all hospitals in different districts be submitted to the Centre,” the officer said.“Regarding home isolation, he said in order to control Covid cases, they can consider home isolation or quarantine facilities,” he added.At present, UP, unlike Delhi, is admitting Covid-19 positive patients, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, to dedicated Covid hospitals. According to sources, Shah also suggested that NCR districts can consider adopting the price limit of Rs 2,400 fixed for Covid-19 testing in Delhi.On Thursday, the UP health officials in an order directed that the rate of Covid samples (single step) sent to private laboratories by government or private hospitals will be ₹20000 while rate of ₹2,500 will be applicable for samples collected on their own by private laboratories.These directions were given by Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health).There were 39 more positive cases in Ghaziabad on Thursday while four more deaths were reported. With this addition, the tally of Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad stands at 757 while the total deaths stand at 36 till June 18.“Three of four deaths took place in Ghaziabad while one took place in Meerut,” Ghaziabad chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/union-home-minister-favours-unified-delhi-ncr-to-deal-with-coronavirus/story-NgbhnhEaarKaNHnZnniJIN.html
19-06-2020||Gurugram||Pandemic evokes interest in home schooling in Gurugram||Schools in the district became one of the first casualties of Covid-19, with most of them shutting down in March under orders from the district administration.Eager to continue the learning process for their kids, parents in the city are exploring home schooling as a possible option. Home-schooling networks and organisations have seen an increase in queries from parents, who either don’t see much merit in paying for online classes or plan to explore home schooling till the time the pandemic continues to prevail. The current situation has invigorated the conversation around home schooling, especially with children staying at home, at least for the near future, say home schoolers.Sheetal, a Faridabad-parent who switched to home schooling for her daughter in March, said that while she had been thinking about home schooling for the past two years, the pandemic just helped hasten her decision. When schools across the country shut down due to a lockdown put in place to check the spread of the Covid-19 virus in March, Sheetal said, her child’s school started sending assignments through WhatsApp initially and followed it up with online classes, which started with the beginning of the new session.“I attended online classes with my 8-year-old daughter on the first day of the new session. During the class, my husband and I realised that my daughter was attending classes from 8am till 4pm. In the past as well, I have often corrected teachers and shared feedback with them, but these online classes helped us to witness first-hand the quality of learning that was taking place. We felt that the teaching was not up to the mark and focus was mostly on getting children to stay online all the time,” said Sheetal, who withdrew her daughter from the school in March itself.She said that growing up, she was never stressed about school or education. “One has to be careful with what happens in schools these days. Incidents of negligence take place all the time and now with the pandemic, I am not at all confident about sending my daughter back to a school. I want her to study in a stress-free environment at home,” said Sheetal, who plans to continue teaching her child at home even after the pandemic.Neha Anand, a member of the home schooling community in Gurugram, said that she had been receiving many queries from parents who wanted to explore home schooling. “Children are not going to school due to the pandemic and parents are seeing it as a good opportunity to give a shot at home schooling. People don’t easily take up home schooling in India but they are giving it a try under the current circumstances. I have been getting many queries from parents who want to at least try out home schooling now that they have time on their hands,” said Anand. Anand is among a group of 250 parents who are a part of a small but fledging community of home-schoolers in the city who are connected via a WhatsApp group. Prior to the lockdown, the group used to have regular meetings. Anand said that both parents with older children in senior classes and those with younger children were eagerly taking up home schooling. “I know parents who have already informed schools that they’d no longer be sending children to school at least for this year. They have shifted to home schooling completely,” said Anand.Anand, who has been home schooling her children for the past three years, calls it one of the best decisions of her life. “It is possible that people might stay with home schooling after the pandemic or some might shift back to traditional schooling. But nevertheless, a conversation around home schooling has at least started, which is a start,” she said.Saurav Dutta, who runs the Facebook group Homeschooling India, said that requests from people seeking to join the groups have shot up in the past few months. Dutta said that prior to the lockdown, the group used to receive 20-30 requests in a week whereas now, over a hundred requests are received in a week. While the spike in people joining the group doesn’t necessarily mean that all people were switching to home schooling, they were curious and wanted to know more about the concept, explained Dutta. He also said that many parents were considering opting for home schooling for a few months or years which was a matter of concern. “We have received a number of queries on the group that I moderate. But many parents are yet to understand that home schooling is more than just learning at home. Some parents are confused and switching to home schooling without knowing what it entails might be dangerous in the long run,” said Dutta, a Mumbai resident. He also runs an initiative that documents all kinds of alternative education programs taking place across the country.He said that in the near future, marks would no longer be the criteria for adjudging a person’s capabilities and the focus will increasingly be on skills and life experiences, something that home schooling focused on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/pandemic-evokes-interest-in-home-schooling-in-gurugram/story-haVevQxXjLmsBWdaAN458N.html

This is the lowest number of cases reported in a single day since June 6. On Thursday, at 2164 the number of patients in the district who have recovered from Covid-19 so far also surpassed Gurugram’s active cases now resting at 1,775 (down from 1861 on Wednesday). One person succumbed to the infection on Thursday taking the death toll to 52.Of the total active cases, 521 patients are currently hospitalised, either at dedicated Covid-19 hospitals or health care centers, while 1,201 have been put under home isolation. As many as 53 patients are under observation at district Covid care centers.Dr Virender Yadav, Gurugram’s chief medical officer, said, “A total of 251 patients were found to have recovered today. This is always a good sign. Flattening the curve means a reduction in active cases, which frees up health care resources for other patients who may need it.” Officials said testing numbers would be increasing in the coming days, as was the case on Thursday, when the district conducted 686 tests (its highest in a day so far), up from 365 tests on Wednesday. The district’s test-positivity rate was 18.8%, the lowest since May 28, with 557 samples testing negative.According to the district health department data, Gururgram’s recovery rate on Thursday stood at 54.2%, up from 50.05% on June 16. Experts said while this may seem like a positive development, Gurugram’s requires an increase in testing to prevent the curve from veering upward in the coming days. An analysis of health bulletin data shows that till June 17, there has been a 28 percent decline in testing numbers since June 12. While the daily average number of samples tested from June 1 to June 12 stood at 403 samples per day, this number has fallen to just 288 samples per day, on average, in the past one week (till June 17). During this same period, the test-positivity rate rose by 21 percent, from 44 percent till June 12, to 65 percent. “Rising positivity rate with reduced testing means you are not testing enough. If you test less, then naturally you will find fewer cases,” said Rajesh Kumar, an epidemiologist and former professor of community medicine at PGIMS Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/with-129-new-covid-cases-gurugram-inches-towards-4-000-mark/story-nrQI3O5wHoiytnnHAvtJoJ.html
19-06-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19: Gurugram to conduct antigen detection test||To expedite the process of Covid-19 testing in Haryana, especially in the districts adjoining the national Capital, the state government will use an antigen detection test, which can deliver results within 15-30 minutes. In a review meeting with Union home affairs minister Amit Shah on Thursday regarding Covid-19 management in Delhi-NCR, Haryana has been directed to widely use the antigen detection tests to cover more people. The RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) will continue to remain gold standard front-line test for Covid-19. But with the new testing strategy in place, the state health department has capped the prices of RT-PCR at ₹2,400 in Haryana, said a state government official. The state health department has already placed an order of 100,000 kits with a South Korean company based in Manesar. Approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), these kits will help in identifying the substance that induces an immune response in the body after SARS -CoV-2 virus enters the body.Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, said, “The antigen test is different from the antibody test. The antigen tests detect the substance that leads to the immune response in the body against the virus. If the antigen test shows a positive result, it should be considered as a true positive. In case, the test is negative, then the sample will be collected for the RT-PCR.” Notably, the antibody test shows the past infection due to the coronavirus.The test can detect true negatives in at least 99% cases and positives in up to 84% of the cases. Any test result is considered reliable if it has a higher ability to detect true negatives. said state health department officials. The company in Manesar has got the approval to manufacture kits for the antigen test. The kit comes with a Covid-19 antigen test device, swab for a sample collection from the nose, and viral extraction tube with viral lysis buffer that makes the virus inactive.Arora said that the price of the kit has been fixed at ₹450. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), said, “The health department has initially received kits to conduct 200 tests. The plan on who all will be tested is yet to be made as we have received the kits on Thursday itself. An area-wise plan will be prepared based on which we will target the population who will be tested with these kits.” As per the ICMR guidelines, the test has to be conducted in the containment zones, including symptomatic, asymptomatic or those with co-morbidities. The test can also be conducted in hospitals. According to a statement issued by the district administration, Shah, in the meeting, said that a testing campaign will be carried out to identify the persons infected with the SARS -CoV-2 virus in the Delhi-NCR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-to-conduct-antigen-detection-test/story-Hv8lbxVlty6u7L947ldUlM.html
19-06-2020||Delhi||In two days, over 2.7k fined for flouting mask, distancing rules in Delhi||The Delhi Police have fined over 2,700 people for offences such as not wearing masks, flouting social distancing rules and spitting in public. These are among five offences for which the Delhi government last week announced penalties amounting to Rs 500 for the first offence and Rs 1,000 for subsequent offences.The fines were imposed on the violators from Monday until 5 pm on Wednesday. The south-west district police issued the most fines— 401—on the first three days of the order being implemented in the national capital. The outer north district collected the fewest fines and penalised a little less than three dozen people. Apart from not wearing masks, flouting social distancing norms and spitting in public places, other offences which draw this penalty are disobeying quarantine rules and consuming chewable tobacco products in public places.The police said that while they are yet to ascertain whether the monetary fines are a better deterrent than registering FIRs against the violators, the response to the penalties is encouraging.“Issuing fines has been 100% effective so far. It is serving as a deterrent to people, many of who were gathering at public places without wearing masks. The fact that subsequent offences invite a fine of Rs 1,000 will make it even more effective,” Mandeep Singh Randhawa, Delhi Police’s spokesperson, said.Until this order came in, the Delhi Police had been going about booking offenders under the Indian Penal Code Section 188 (disobedience to an order promulgated by a public servant) which could cause a convict to be jailed for up to a month or be fined Rs 200, or both.Until the end of May, the police had booked nearly 25,000 such people, apart from detaining another 3.7 lakh and letting them off.While reserving FIRs only for those who refuse to pay a fine, police officers on the ground said that the monetary penalties have been a better deterrent than FIRs.“These fines are having the same impact that traffic fines have. Violators who thought getting booked was a far-fetched idea are afraid because this has an immediate financial impact on them,” PK Mishra, the deputy commissioner of police of Rohini district, where 212 people were penalised over two days, said.The police are using the new law to crack down on offenders, but Vikram Singh, the former director-general of police of Uttar Pradesh, said that the authorities need to be “cautious and compassionate” while dealing with offenders during the “warlike” situation that the pandemic is.“These are habits that die hard. And the people committing these offences are not really criminals. The police would do well to first educate them, then warm them and impose fines on only those who are hell-bent on not obeying the orders,” Singh said.While the government order has provision for an FIR against those not paying the fine, the police said they are choosing to offer masks and educate poor people who may not have the money to pay the fines. Over the three days, the police said they distributed 8,724 masks to the needy.“The police teams are armed with masks for violators who may not have the means to pay fines. The priority ultimately is to create awareness,” said DCP Mishra, adding that while most of the checking is taking place at pickets, there are also special police teams taking rounds of neighbourhoods to spot violators.“Civilians are pointing out violators to us,” the DCP said.A vast majority (66%) of the penalties were for not wearing masks, followed by social distancing violations (13%). Fines for spitting and consuming tobacco products (0.84%) amounted to a tiny percentage of the penalties.Deepak Yadav, an additional deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi), said that police personnel are visiting tobacco shops to tell the shopkeepers to warn their customers.The New Delhi district has seen 165 violators getting caught in the act in two days.The police said that keeping a tab on repeat offenders was the task assigned to local police teams. “They maintain a register of the offenders. They know who has repeated an offence,” said Vijayanta Arya, DCP (north-west), whose district has fined 177 people.The government order which came into effect from Saturday is valid for one year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-two-days-over-2-7k-fined-for-flouting-mask-distancing-rules-in-delhi/story-BOyyn9WODTz8UxF9YeOKnL.html
19-06-2020||Delhi||Only 6 of 10 students in Delhi govt schools joined online classes during lockdown, shows govt data||Less than six out of 10 government school students in Delhi could access virtual learning--- either through online classes or WhatsApp and interactive voice response (IVR) technology--- during the first two months of the lockdown enforced to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, data collated by the government from its 1,030 schools shows. The Delhi government’s directorate of education (DoE) had last month asked all its schools to provide details of students with whom they were in regular touch during the lockdown, how many of them accessed virtual learning and how many could not be contacted at all. The data was sought along with other inputs to draw “micro plans” for each school whenever the situation favours reopening them for students, officials with direct knowledge of the matter said. A senior government official, requesting anonymity, said, “It’s been found that 77% of the around 1,500,000 students, or 1,155,000, enrolled in Delhi government schools remained in contact with the schools during the lockdown. But only 76% of these 1,155,000 students or 877,800 accessed virtual learning either through online classes or WhatsApp and IVR technology during this period. This effectively means 58.5% of total students enrolled in 1,030 government schools had accessed virtual learning.”According to the data from the months of April and May, 23% of 1,500,000 students or 345,000 could not be contacted during this period. Officials at schools cited reverse migration and economic challenges faced by people during the lockdown as a major reason behind it. Classes were suspended in Delhi schools on March 13 due to the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic in the city. The classes continued to remain suspended when the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 23 to contain the viral disease. The Delhi government started conducting online classes for class 12 students from April 6 and sending e-learning material or activities to those enrolled in classes nursery to eighth over WhatsApp or SMS. The directorate of education last month began online mathematics classes for students of classes ninth and 10th in collaboration with Khan Academy, a non-profit educational organisation.The Delhi government had also provided a subsidy of Rs 200 for internet packages to all its class 12 students who had registered for the online classes.Several principals of government schools said the lack of devices and internet facilities remained a challenge for their students to access virtual education. “Despite the internet package, many of our students do not have smartphones or devices. Many students who had initially registered for the online classes but did not attend regularly. When we contacted them, they told us they do not get proper internet connection at homes or the mobile phones were not working properly. Many young students did not respond to the activities sent over WhatsApp or SMS’,” said the principal of a government boys’ senior secondary school in Karawal Nagar on condition of anonymity.Among those who could not access e-learning amid the lockdown were two daughters of Ayyub, a mason. “My daughters (11 and 13 years) study in classes sixth and eighth in a government school in Jahangirpuri. They could not check the work sent by their school to students over WhatsApp as we do not have a smartphone. Their teachers had called many times and told them what to do at home over the call. They could not even complete that work also since our family has been struggling to make ends meet amid the lockdown. There is no work even now as well,” he said.Explaining the reasons why 23% students could not be contacted during the lockdown, AK Jha, principal of a government co-ed school in Rohini, said, “Majority of the students who could not be contacted have left the city with their families amid the lockdown. When we could not contact them, we sought help from the students living in their neighbourhood and we were told that their houses were locked. Majority of these students are in primary classes. Also, many families did not update their contact numbers due to which they cannot be contacted now.”Binay Bhusan, Director of the DoE, said the government schools will particularly focus on students who could not attend online classes or access online learning once the schools reopen. “We have asked all our schools to keep a track on students who cannot access e-learning so that we can draw our post lockdown school plans accordingly. Extra classes will be conducted for these students. Also, the government is working on how to track the students who are completely out of contact now to bring them back to the classes. Many of these students have left the city with their families amid the lockdown,” he said.Education expert Shyama Chona said the only alternative in such a situation when so many students don’t have access to devices and internet is to run classes on television. “Majority of the households in India have televisions and the government can broadcast classes on television in case the situation does not improve in near future.The government should properly track all these students who were out of contact during the lockdown once the schools reopen. They will have to come out with ways for it,” she said.The Delhi government had in April requested the union human resource development ministry to provide them slots on Doordarshan and air time on All India Radio (AIR) to broadcast classes for their students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/only-6-of-10-students-in-delhi-govt-schools-joined-online-classes-during-lockdown-shows-govt-data/story-t8uCLHbiAy0PUWrUOn5BJI.html
19-06-2020||Mumbai||80,000 Covid-19 cases by June-end? BMC says can’t predict peak yet||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is anticipating 80,000 Covid-19 cases in the city by the end of June, if the current pace of growth continues over the next 12 days. The civic body expects the impact of relaxations announced on June 3, as part of the Maharashtra government’s ‘Mission Begin Again’, to be seen in a week. Under ‘Mission Begin Again’, the state relaxed several restrictions even in red zones such as Mumbai, allowing non-essential shops, private offices (10% of its strength) to open, besides permitting Mumbaiites to step out for physical exercise by opening public gardens and beaches.Last week, HT had reported the civic body was preparing for the “worst case scenario of Mumbai breaching the one-lakh-case mark by June-end” by ramping up crucial medical infrastructure such as beds and ventilators. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of BMC, said, “We have stabilised the number of cases since May 16 or 17, when we started getting over 1,000 cases daily. In the past one month, our one-day tally did not cross 1,700 or 1,800. The numbers have stabilised for now, but we can’t estimate the peak or saturation point. We will have to wait for one more week.”Senior civic officials said assuming 1,500 cases are reported in the city daily for another 12 days, there will be 19,500 additional cases by the end of the month. This brings the estimated total to around 81,000 cases. If this pace continues, Mumbai could breach the one lakh mark by July. However, Kakani said: “Although two weeks have passed since June 3, when we announced relaxations, there was rainfall and high alert advisory issued owing to cyclone Nisarga in the initial period, due to which people were home. Assuming people started venturing out from June 8, we have crossed the 10-day period of relaxation. We will have to wait for another one week to understand the impact of relaxation or to make any further estimation.”BMC had last week claimed it was boosting medical facilities to handle around one lakh cases, of which over 58,000 were expected to be active, by June-end. According to BMC’s data, the occupancy rate as of Wednesday is 69% for beds, 96% for ICU beds, and 97% for ventilators.Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based private health consultant, said, “In the past one month, the capacity of our medical infrastructure has doubled, and the cases have risen from around 15,000-20,000 to 60,000. However, we will have to scale it up at a much faster rate, if we are of the belief that the peak has yet not arrived.”Paliwal said, “On any given day, the occupancy rate for ICU beds and ventilators is above 90%. This is a good sign, considering earlier there were a lot of complaints of non-availability of beds. To handle one lakh cases, our health infrastructure will have to be scaled up by around 60-80%.”BMC has so far conducted 2.69 lakh tests and is conducting 4,500-5,000 tests daily, said Kakani. “In the past one week, we have touched the 5,000 mark twice, on June 12 and June 16. We have the capacity to conduct around 7,000-8,000 tests daily,” he said. The civic body has also set up 412 clinics and screened 25,000 people, of which around 10,000 were screened in 90 fever clinics that were set up in the past one month. BMC officials said they have concentrated on areas with high growth rate in the western suburbs, instead of just focusing on hotspots such as Dharavi, Worli, Mankhurd and Govandi.Dharavi, one of the critical hotspots in Mumbai which is showing signs of improvement, reported only 17 cases and one death on Wednesday, taking the total to 2,106 cases and 78 deaths. Kiran Dighavkar, additional municipal commissioner of G-North ward, which covers Dharavi, said, “We have screened over six lakh citizens in Dharavi until now and are continuing with it. We have set up several fever clinics in Dharavi and also taken help of private clinics.”BMC, in a statement on Thursday, said it was making arrangements of 2.08 lakh litres of oxygen across 20 hospitals to treat patients with respiratory issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/80k-covid-cases-by-june-end-bmc-says-can-t-predict-peak-yet/story-PrZ60n81sIxX12pbdqUvBL.html
19-06-2020||City||Mohali crosses 200 mark in 90 days||Three months after Mohali confirmed its first Covid-19 case on March 20, the number of cases crossed the 200 mark on Thursday with 11 new patients.The latest cases include nine patients from Dera Bassi sub-division and two from Kurali that have raised the district tally to 204.Among the Dera Bassi patients is a 34-year-old staff nurse who works at the Manimajra civil hospital. She is a resident of Bhankarpur village.Four patients are from Mubarakpur village, including two females, aged 75 and 55, and two males, aged 27 and 25.Besides, two patients are from Dera Bassi’s Focal Point area, a 35-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman. Two men from Lalru, aged 66 and 25, were also found infected. They are contacts of a positive patient.The Kurali patients are a 40-year-old man and a 14-year-old girl, also contacts of a positive person, who had recently returned from Uttar Pradesh. Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said the staff nurse had attended to some patients from Chandigarh’s Bapu Dham Colony at work. All patients had been admitted to Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur, he said.Meanwhile, two patients were discharged from the hospital on Thursday.With this, of the 204 cases in Mohali, 134 have recovered and three have died, leaving 67 active cases. RANDOM SAMPLING BEGINS AT BHANKHARPUR BEER PLANT, 41 SAMPLES TAKENAfter four Covid-19 cases cropped up at a beer plant at Bhankharpur village, the health department on Thursday started random sampling of the employees. Civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said the plant had about 350 employees and the sampling will be completed in five days. On Thursday, Dr Preet Mohan Singh collected 41 samples, he added. On Wednesday, the civil surgeon, along with senior health officials, had visited the plant to assess the situation and spoke to the workers. The health department has already sealed the administrative block of the factory, as the four positive employees were employed there. The rest of the staff of the department have been instructed to quarantine themselves at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-crosses-200-mark-in-90-days/story-fhpidm1NbxELwqxwFjtrcO.html
19-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC asks Jaypee to hand over waste processing plant today||The Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) has made a final push to control the city’s controversial waste management project, asking Jaypee, the firm controlling the city’s Dadumajra garbage processing plant, to hand over the plant by Friday evening.After the MC general house terminated Jaypee’s contract the civic body issued a termination notice on March 5 asking the firm to hand over the plant within a week.The district courts, however, after being approached by Jaypee, stayed the order on March 12, following which MC initiated the action.“The interim stay granted by the court was from March 12 to June 12. Since the order passed was for definite period, which has expired and there is no order of stay by any court of law, now, the impugned order dated March 5 passed by MC stands active,” read a letter issued by MC commissioner KK Yadav on Thursday.Jaypee had been given time in between to appoint an arbitrator, he said.“After consulting with the legal team we have decided to take over. We have given the firm time till 5pm on Friday to hand it over. In case the firm fails (to do so), MC will take over the plant on its own and entertain no further claims by the firm,” Yadav added.MC has also deployed a surveillance team at the plant to thwart any attempts by the firm’s officials to remove anything from the premises.National Green Tribunal orderAccording to the March termination notice, MC signed an agreement with Jaypee in 2005 for setting up a garbage processing plant, which over the years was not operated to its optimum capacity.The plant was only processing 120 metric tonnes (MT) of waste against a requirement of 450 MT, with the remaining waste being illegally dumped in the open ground near the plant. Despite several notices from the MC to rectify the defects, Jaypee did not make any changes.The termination notice quoted a February 12 decision of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in which MC was directed to make alternative arrangements within a month if it was no longer viable to work with Jaypee. The tribunal had in the same month rejected the firm’s plea for a tipping fee for running the plant and slammed Jaypee for not running the plant efficiently.MC officials have also blamed the firm for garbage accumulating in the dumping ground which the civic body had to clear after spending crores of rupees.Group’s local manager NK Vohra didn’t respond to repeated calls and messages.No need for such letters, says Congress Meanwhile, the latest MC letter to the firm elicited sharp criticism from the Congress party. “It is just a formality. They are writing letters to the firm for nearly three years now with no effect. There is no need for such letters, the agreement with the firm allows for immediate takeover. The firm will now get the opportunity to move court,” said Devinder Singh Babla, Congress councillor.The plant’s working has always been an issue of dispute between the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party.Welcoming the move, Arun Sood, city BJP chief and councillor, said, “Now, Congress is showing urgency but it is responsible for the current situation. It signed the contract with the firm with the agreement having no exit clause. Proper procedures have to followed by the MC, and we are now ensuring that proper waste management can take place in the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-asks-jaypee-to-hand-over-waste-processing-plant-today/story-qvUzlEGFKt93AuUrAO6KaK.html

19-06-2020||Pune||No immersion procession during Ganesh festival this year: Pune mandals assure CM||Ganesh mandals in Pune will not carry out immersion procession during the 10-day Ganesh festival to be held in August in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday held a meeting with prominent mandals from Pune and Mumbai via video conferencing, where he appealed to the organisers to refrain from carrying out processions as it would not be possible to allow large crowds thronging the Ganeshotsav marquees and advised low-key celebrations with minimum turnout. Thackeray said that the threat of coronavirus is not yet over and therefore, it will not be possible to celebrate the Ganesh festival with the usual pomp and gaiety. The 10-day festival begins on ‘Ganesh Chaturthi’, which falls on August 22 this year and is a popular festival in Pune and Maharashtra. The pandals set up by various mandals attract thousands of devotees during the 10-day festivities. Responding to Thackeray’s call, Ganesh mandals from Pune decided to cooperate with the state government and cancel the last day’s immersion procession which attracts around five lakh people to the city. During the immersion procession, thousands of devotees walk miles across narrow city lanes and hence, maintaining social distancing and other safety precautions will be an issue. Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh; deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, Pune’s Dagdusheth Halwai Ganesh Trust’s president Ashok Godse; Akhil Mandai Mandal’s president Anna Thorat; Kasba Ganesh mandal’s Shrikant Shete were part of the meeting organised to discuss law and order situation ahead of the Ganesh festival. Most Ganesh mandals in Pune have already decided that the celebrations will be low-key. Godse said, “The chief minister appealed to us to celebrate Ganesh festival in a way that tradition is not broken and all rules are also followed. The administration took a stand considering the Covid-19 pandemic that festivals need to be celebrated in a simple manner.”During the meeting, Thackeray pointed out that because of the pandemic, giving permission for the immersion procession will not be possible. “It is not possible to give permission for the Ganesh processions. We should avoid crowds during such times. A separate meeting will be organised with the ganesh mandals and the administration to decide the do’s and don’ts of the festival,” said Thackeray.Ajit Pawar said, “We have the dual challenge of Covid-19 and the rainy season now. Keeping the festival tradition intact, we need to make a few changes to the way we celebrate it. Festivals should be celebrated at homes.”Ganesh mandals representatives from Pune assured the government that they will follow the guidelines given by the state government. “After Holi, no festival has been celebrated on a large scale this year due to Covid-19. Even the wari, which has a long tradition of 700 years has been forced to change its course. Ganesh festivals have been a part of the social progress and will adhere to norms this year as well.Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we had already decided to celebrate it at a low-level which was appreciated by the government. Now we are awaiting instructions from the state about the do’s and don’ts,” added Godse.Shrikant Shete of the Kasba Ganpati mandal, said, “Ajit Pawar has promised to organise a separate meeting for Pune mandals. We are going to follow all the rules and regulations framed by the state government. This year’s festival will follow all traditional norms and mandals will avoid attracting crowds.Anand Saraf, a pandal worker, said, “Ganesh festival played an important role in various movements, whether it was the independence movement or any other social reform. It has kept traditions alive since it was started in 1892 by Lokmanya Tilak. We will maintain the same spirit this year as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/no-immersion-procession-during-ganesh-festival-this-year-pune-mandals-assure-cm/story-ifkA6gfprBz7xw4ufTABgO.html
19-06-2020||Pune||Recovered cops help boost morale of infected colleagues in Pimpri-Chinchwad||The officials of Pimpri-Chinchwad police who have recovered from Covid-19 are becoming an inspiration for colleagues infected by Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes coronavirus. According to the Pimpri-Chinchwad police, its eight officials have recovered from the virus infection and two are undergoing treatment.“The ones who have recovered call, inquire and advice the infected colleagues. They are helping each other,” said Sudhir Hiremath, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Pimpri-Chinchwad.“The physical discomfort is nothing compared to the mental distress caused by the virus. It is important to have a connect with someone you can trust,” said a 51-year-old police inspector who recently recovered and rejoined the force.The cured official is in touch with the two police staff members who are undergoing treatment at a private hospital.“When I was under treatment, even the doctors did not dare come near us. Only a few nurses were allowed to come and administer injections. It was the daily calls by DCP sir and seniors that boosted my mental strength,” the inspector said.The inspector and his five colleagues were housed in the hospital’s ward. While all of them were asymptomatic, one of them suffered from breathing problems.“A kind word of concern during the isolation period means a lot. The thought of our family members getting positive and the uncertainty about the infection is frightening,” said the inspector.He narrated an incident about news spreading to the house of his 73-year-old father staying separately and caring for his grandson during lockdown.“I had deliberately not shared the infection news with him, but one of our neighbours told my son. My father had to be hospitalised. It was a stressful moment for me,” he said.The reaction of neighbourhood who came to know about his infection was an eye-opener, according to him. In Pune city, the number of positive cases among police officers has crossed 480, including three deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/recovered-cops-help-boost-morale-of-infected-colleagues-in-pimpri-chinchwad/story-3NvtL93Cd29JFGvGc3RygJ.html
19-06-2020||Pune||Pune not high on alcohol home delivery; 80pc of liquor stores do not deliver||Just 20 per cent of Pune’s 165 liquor stores are offering home delivery, according to the Pune District Wine Merchant’s Association.Ajay Deshmukh, secretary of the association, said, “There is a shortage of manpower and many housing societies, even today, don’t allow outsiders to enter. We also have to deliver at no extra cost.” The Maharashtra government allowed liquor stores to open in Pune, and in the state, on May 4.The State excise department, on May 15, allowed home delivery of liquor.Since then, 12 lakh home deliveries of alcohol have been reported in the state, according to figures available with the Pune excise department.Deshmukh believes, in Pune, the biggest obstacle to home deliveries is that the stores have to ensure each of the delivery agents has a medical certificate stating s/he is Covid-free.“Mumbai, has 550 wine shops and 3,000 permit rooms. The government was losing huge revenue. Hence, they wanted to start delivery in Mumbai, but began it across Maharashtra,” Deshmukh adds.According to statistics shared by the state excise department on Wednesday, there are between 60,000 and 65,000 liquor orders being home delivered per day in Maharashtra; but, Pune district is recording not more than five home delivery orders in June. “Home delivery has received maximum response from Mumbai, while Pune still has people preferring off the counter sales,” is state excise commissioner Kantilal Umap’s view.“Sale of liquor, in volume terms, has gone down, though the business has managed to stay afloat,” Umap added.“Since the crowds at wine shops have subsided, people find it easy to purchase liquor across the counter. The home delivery orders are coming from specific areas, and on weekends,” said Santosh Zagade, state excise superintendent.“The trend of drinking and buying liquor in Pune has changed as demand for beer and country liquor has gone down, due to migrants returning and lower-income groups witnessing a fall in income,” said Raju Bagiya, owner of GSP Wines in Aundh.“Those asking for home deliveries are mostly senior citizens, women and premium customers, who don’t want to risk coming to the shop,” said Bagiya. Microbreweries have deliveries on tapOn June 15, the state government brought allowed 25 microbreweries to sell craft beer through growlers. “Growlers are one-five litre glass containers in which beer can be home delivered,” said Umap. Elder statesman for craft brewers in Pune, Manu Gulati, also owner and founder of the Effingut microbrewery and restaurant, estimates his brewery division has suffered a Rs 30 lakh/month loss since the lockdown was imposed in Pune in March.“Pune is a craft beer capital in India. The state government took a very proactive approach and enabled us to get our beer to consumers through way of growlers. The sale of the same has commenced for us since the last two days and we have seen an overwhelming response to our home delivery option,” Gulati says.Effingut currently has 150 home delivery orders per day, across Pune, according to Gulati.Customer speakSarthak Saxena, an IT consultant who lives in Baner, said, “I have not tried the home delivery since Aundh-Baner was a green Zone and when the government gave the OK for wine shops to open, we got alcohol without any problem. I bought enough to last for two weeks.” ”I had ordered using the WhatsApp number of my local wine shop, who was prompt with the delivery; the only problem was that I had to wait near the society gate as no one allowed to come in. It felt a little awkward waiting for delivery of liquor,” said Ravindra P, a resident of Kothrud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-not-high-on-alcohol-home-delivery-80pc-of-liquor-stores-do-not-deliver/story-8upc1F1SDKJlTmUuf1VreL.html

After all, for me, keeping the SSS intact is more important,” Shetti said.Earlier, Jalinder Patil, SSS state unit president, expressed his displeasure that Shetti chose to keep the NCP’s council seat offer for himself. There are currently 12 seats vacant from the governor’s quota. The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) is plans to fill these as soon as possible.For Shetti, a former two-time MP from Hatkanangale in Kolhapur, accepting a seat from the NCP quota comes after he had joined hands with the Congress-NCP alliance just before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, after breaking away from BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-decline-ncp-s-offer-of-seat-on-mlc-raju-shetti/story-gUBLppeL2Dd6HZBPU7etGM.html

The local bodies department also blacklisted the company, barring it from participating in any tendering process of the Mohali MC for three years.The department further asked the company to deposit the advance amount of ₹89 lakh paid by the civic body with 12% annual interest within 21 days from now.Bansal’s inquiry report found several discrepancies in the tendering process of issuing purchase orders to a particular company for the machines.The four former MC officials, who were indicted in the report, are executive engineer Naresh Batta, now in Hoshiarpur; deputy controller finance and accounts (DCFA) Vinayak Kumar, now in Ludhiana; assistant corporation engineer Mohinder Pal, now sub-divisional engineer (SDO) posted at the head office of the local bodies department in Sector 35, Chandigarh; and junior engineer Surinder Goel, now retired.They will appear before the additional chief secretary of local bodies, Sanjay Kumar on June 19, where the further course of action will be decided.Tenders were floated on September 26, 2016, for Rs 1.80 crore after Mohali MC decided to buy the machine. Interestingly, the machine was not delivered to the civic body, prompting some councillors to allege corruption in the deal, following which BR Bansal was appointed to investigate the matter.The cancellation report further reads that the vetting report by chief vigilance officer (trust) opined that the work order was issued by Mohali MC in violation of the rules, and gross irregularities and other serious deficiencies have been found on part of the firm in connivance with MC officials. There is no record with MC proving that proper advertisement or public notice was made and how the company came to know about the requirement of a tree pruning machine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-local-bodies-cancels-order-of-tree-pruning-machine/story-QENHPtPEuOi3iHGpuSAvTJ.html
19-06-2020||Pune||PMC looks at ‘healthy ageing’ initiative for elderly in 40 slums through SCHOOL as part of Covid response||Seven volunteers of School (Society of Community Health Oriented Operational Links) worked tirelessly to help 515 senior citizens, of the Kasturba Vasahat and Indira Vasahat in Aundh, manage their daily chores and health needs during the lockdown. Endorsing the reach of the organisation and its volunteers, which has been working to establish a ‘senior citizens’ community centre’, Pune Municipal Corporation commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, mandated them to expand their work across slums in Pune city to help at least 40,000 senior citizens.“In April, PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad endorsed the work we have been doing in the Aundh slums and mandated us to expand our work across all slums of Pune city. So, we have started micro-planning for 40 slums with the help of the World Health Organisation (WHO),” said Benazir Patil, chief executive officer (CEO) of the organisation.Over the past year, School volunteers have been taking various initiatives related to the health, mental well-being and entertainment of senior citizens in the Aundh slums. During the lockdown, seven volunteers of the organisation, three from outside and four within the community, under the technical guidance of the WHO, took care of the elderly. Now, it will be a part of the Covid-19 response and will be extended to 40 other slums among the eight big slum clusters of Pune city.Dr Kalpana Baliwant, assistant medical officer at PMC, said, “School organisation is doing good work in two of the slums in Aundh ward. They presented their work to us in April, specifically regarding care for elderly people during Covid-19. So, we have asked them to expand their ‘Healthy Ageing’ initiative to 40 densely-populated slums in eight slum clusters namely Yerawada, Aundh, Ghole road, Bibwewadi, Bhavani peth, Sahakarnagar, Warje-Karvenagar and Hadapsar. For this initiative we are also getting support from the WHO Maharashtra office.” Giving the details of the daily timetable of the volunteers, Patil, said, “There are currently two types of volunteers working with the centre, two of them are our community officials who live at the centre and four volunteers are from the slums itself who work on a voluntary basis. They come to the centre in the morning at 10am and pack food packets, then deliver the packets to elderly. They also visit those who are not keeping well and see if they need support and inform them of their next check-up. Our community officers, if needed, check blood pressure, sugar or oxygen levels with the pulse oximeter. Volunteers also help the community officers in distribution of raw ration, hygiene kits, masks, medicines and adult diapers.”“We had a good meeting with the representatives of the organisation and soon, I will be personally visiting both the slums to understand their work properly. We will be taking up the initiative in 40 other slums under PMC, so that we can save more lives of our senior citizens during this crisis situation,” said the civic chief Gaikwad.For 63-year-old Gorakh Dada Gaikwad, School volunteers are nothing short of miracle for the elderly. “When the lockdown was announced, we were worried as to how we will manage our daily food and ration for the house. But when the organisation helped us by providing ration kits, it provided a great relief to my entire family. The volunteers regularly visit our home and check if we need supplies, medical and otherwise.” Kanta Joma Waghmare, a 70-year-old who lives in the Aundh slums, said, “It is God’s grace that School volunteers are working for us and look after us. This is the greatest service they could have done. Both ration and medicines were provided to me at a time when I needed them the most.” Akash Ashok Adhav, 25, a student, who works as a volunteer and also lives in the slums, said, “I had been going to collect adult diapers for my grandmother earlier and when the lockdown started, they asked if I wanted to volunteer with them. So, I started working and initially provided ration kits, distributed food packets, multi-vitamin tablets and then, they taught me how to check blood pressure, test sugar levels and collect information from critical patients who are bound to their homes. All the safety equipment like face masks, sanitisers and hand gloves were given to me. My friends also helped me when they saw me work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-looks-at-healthy-ageing-initiative-for-elderly-in-40-slums-through-school-as-part-of-covid-response/story-ejzekPNGMSm3xtTjDPl7rJ.html

19-06-2020||Chandigarh||₹7.6 lakh stolen from ATM at Chandigarh’s Kishangarh village||A masked man stole Rs 7.6 lakh from a Union Bank of India (Andhra Bank) ATM in Kishangarh village on Wednesday night.Police said as per the CCTV footage, a masked man entered the ATM around 8.30pm and headed straight for the machine’s backside. And as he sat down to open the machine, the CCTV camera footage faded away, which the police suspect may have been caused due to a power outage. The theft was discovered on Thursday morning when the bank manager learnt that customers were unable to withdraw money from the ATM though it was loaded with cash. Bank officials alerted the police after they found that the ATM machine had been opened from the backside and all the cash was missing. In his complaint, branch manager Parveen Kumar Aggarwal reported a loss of Rs 7.64 lakh, but said there was no damage to the ATM.On his complaint, a case under Section 380 (theft in dwelling house, etc) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the IT Park police station.The theft came close on the heels of a robbery at PNB’s all-women branch in Phase-3A, Mohali, where Rs 5 lakh were stolen. INSIDER JOB SUSPECTED According to a bank official, the ATM’s cash is loaded in its strong room, which is locked with a password. Even if one is able to break open the ATM, the cash cannot be removed without inputting the password. Police said their preliminary investigation indicated that the crime was the handiwork of someone familiar with this secret code. Branch manager Parveen Kumar Aggarwal told the police that only two bank employees knew the password, including him and another person.

19-06-2020||World||More Indians turned against Labour, says 2019 UK poll review||An internal review of the election debacle suffered by Labour in the December 2019 election suggests that more members of the 1.5 million-strong Indian community in the UK voted against it, reinforcing pro-Conservative trends in recent elections. The review into Labour’s worst election result since 1935 blames several factors for the defeat, including lack of clarity on its Brexit position, a ‘toxic culture’ of conflict within the party, and negative perceptions of the former leader, Jeremy Corbyn.Once a natural party of preference of the Indian community due to its largely pro-immigration policies, Labour has been haemorrhaging support since the early 2000s to the Conservatives, particularly from the young, aspirational second and third generations.The review says that Labour retained a ‘strong advantage’ among Black and Minority Ethnic voters, winning 64 per cent of BME voters against the Conservatives’ 20 per cent, adding that it retained a comparatively high proportion (over 80 per cent) of Labour 2017 election voters identifying as Arab, white and black Caribbean, Bangladeshi and Pakistani, compared to 73 per cent of voters identifying as White British.On Indian community voters, it says: “Retention rates among voters who identified as Indian were even lower, however, at 68 per cent – likely reflecting the growing support for the Conservatives among voters identifying as Hindu”.“Hindu voters who had supported Labour in 2017 were 42 per cent likely to withdraw their support in 2019 – compared to Muslim voters who were 80 per cent likely to stick with Labour”, it adds.The 2019 election was clouded by resentment in the Indian community about the party’s stand on Jammu and Kashmir and claims that some of its MPs and members joined or supported large demonstrations outside India House that turned violent on August 15 and September 3.The developments not only angered large sections of the community, but also led to a diplomatic row with New Delhi, which rejected a resolution on Jammu and Kashmir adopted at the party’s annual conference before the election.The review says: “Labour has a mountain to climb to get back into power in the next five years. This report lays out in stark detail the scale of that task. Unless as a party and a movement we face up to that we will not win”.“In the words of our candidates and activists, the strategy was inadequate, the organisation was muddled and the execution was poor….It would be a mistake to believe that a different leader, with Brexit no longer the defining issue, would in itself be sufficient to change Labour’s electoral fortunes”.Ed Miliband, former party leader, was one of the key party MPs involved in the review.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-indians-turned-against-labour-says-2019-uk-poll-review/story-gATRnojAwv1o8PkD1DxOvK.html
19-06-2020||World||Putin calls fuel spill unprecedented for Russia, Greenpeace sees $1.4 billion damage||President Vladimir Putin said on Friday the scale of the clear-up operation after a huge fuel spill in the Arctic was unprecedented for Russia, with Greenpeace estimating the environmental damage to waters in the region at $1.4 billion. A vast fuel tank lost pressure on May 29 and unleashed 21,000 tonnes of diesel into rivers and subsoil near the city of Norilsk, an incident that Greenpeace has compared to the devastating 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska.“Russia has not yet had experience of clearing up such vast pollution from bodies of water as far as I understand,” Putin told officials on state television. It will take at least 10 years for biodiversity in the waters to fully return where the accident happened, the state fishing agency said at the meeting.The state environmental watchdog plans to finish its assessment of the damage by July 1, its head told Putin. Vladimir Chuprov, a Greenpeace activist, said the damage to the water totalled 100 billion roubles ($1.44 billion), a figure that was higher than it should be because of what he said was the slow official response, the TASS news agency reported. The city of Norilsk is home to mining giant Norilsk Nickel. The company and emergency specialists are collecting contaminated soil and fuel from local rivers into containers.Nornickel has already spent 5 billion roubles on the clean-up, its co-owner Vladimir Potanin said. The mining giant also plans to spend 13.5 billion roubles on safety checks for its remaining fuel storage tanks in 2020-2021.More than 90% of the fuel from the rivers and about 70% of the contaminated soil have been already collected, Nornickel said earlier this week.Putin previously ordered officials to check all similar fuel storages in Russia, and they plan to complete this process by July 24, they told him.

19-06-2020||World||WHO should change rules that led it to oppose travel restrictions, ex-chief says||The World Health Organization should change guidelines that led it to oppose travel restrictions early in the coronavirus epidemic, said former WHO chief Gro Harlem Brundtland, who now chairs an independent watchdog that monitors the global body.The WHO’s decision to oppose travel restrictions when it declared an international emergency on Jan. 30 has been one of the steps criticised by the United States, which has announced it will quit the UN agency.Brundtland, speaking to a briefing on Friday, strongly opposed the U.S. decision to quit the WHO. But she acknowledged a need to look at the guidelines, known as the International Health Regulations, agreed by member states years earlier and which discourage restricting trade and travel during epidemics.The guidelines “need reform and we will propose reforms because we have seen weaknesses very clearly,” Brundtland said. “In the whole process of formulating and agreeing on the International Health Regulations, many countries were adamant to try to avoid air and travel restrictions.”She said some governments had worried that the threat of travel restrictions would cause countries not to report outbreaks.Brundtland, a former Norwegian prime minister who led the WHO from 1998-2003, said China’s delay last year in reporting the new coronavirus had led to more cases, but that Beijing’s response was far better than during the 2003 SARS outbreak.“I think it’s right to say that China had maybe learned something from the SARS experience where they really closed down and refused to speak to the WHO and even to me as director-general when I had to enter in,” Brundtland said.“This time, China did communicate with WHO, although I do believe that it took too many days, maybe a week or two more than it should (have), to really give the information that they already had,” she said.President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will quit the WHO and withhold funding for the body, which Trump says was too supportive of China early in the crisis.Brundtland said quitting the WHO was “the most astonishingly and transparently counterproductive” of all of Trump’s moves against multilateral arrangements. “I believe the WHO is essential,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-should-change-rules-that-led-it-to-oppose-travel-restrictions-ex-chief-says/story-sOlqOxYlAHRQjGOm22Hh5I.html
19-06-2020||World||More Covid-19 positive Indians in UK likely to die due to diabetes: Study||A major new study released on Friday says that people of Indian and other south Asian origin are more likely to die after contracting coronavirus due at least in part to a higher prevalence of pre-existing diabetes than others with similar disease conditions. The study by experts at the University of Edinburgh of nearly 35,000 patients in 260 UK hospitals says that Indians and other sections categorised as ethnic minorities are more likely to be admitted to critical care and receive invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) than Whites.Ewen Harrison, study lead and professor of surgery and data science at the university, said: “These findings once again put ethnicity at front and centre in determining the effects of Covid-19. It is tragic to see any group in society to be at increased risk compared to others”. “Diabetes is more common in South Asian people and this is likely to explain some of these findings, further research is needed to understand this association and the underlying reasons for this increased risk”.“There are important implications for policy - South Asian people are more likely to be in public facing jobs particularly in health and social care. Policy makers should account for ethnicity when developing future guidelines around Covid-19,” he added.The findings released before publication in a journal add to recent reports by Public Health England and other bodies that highlight the disproportionate impact of the virus on the ethnic minority population in the UK; the reasons include pre-existing economic inequalities.The study researchers recruited hospitalised patients with suspected/confirmed Covid-19 from 260 hospitals across England, Scotland and Wales, collecting data directly and from records between February 6 and May 8 with follow-up until May 22.Of 34,986 patients enrolled, Indian and other ethnic minorities were younger and more likely to have diabetes (type 1/type 2) but had fewer other co-morbidities such as chronic heart disease or dementia than the White group, the study says.No difference was seen between ethnic groups in the time from symptom onset to hospital admission, nor in illness severity at admission. Critical care admission was more common in South Asian, Black, and other ethnic minority groups compared to the White group, after adjusting for age, sex and location.The study says: “This was broadly unchanged after adjustment for deprivation and co-morbidities.

19-06-2020||World||Beijing Covid-19 strain could have come from Europe, says Chinese expert||The coronavirus strain that triggered the ongoing outbreak in Beijing could have originated in Europe, local officials said Friday after Chinese scientists released the genome sequence of samples picked up from the Xinfadi market linked to nearly all the cases.Preliminary genetic sequencing research shows that this virus came from Europe , Zhang Yong, an assistant director at China’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was quoted as saying, adding that strain is older than the viruses currently circulating in Europe.Gao Fu, the CDC director, had earlier said the virus could have started spreading in Beijing as early as the start of May.The genome sequencing, put out late Thursday, had been shared with the WHO and the Global Influenza Data Initiative (GISAID), the CDC said.The first cluster of new coronavirus infections was traced to the Huanan seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the first epidentre of the pandemic, in December.It has since infected almost 8.5 million people globally.Earlier in the day, the national health commission (NHC) said Beijing had added 25 new cases of Covid-19 for June 18, four more than the day before, taking the total number to 183 for the new outbreak in the city with nearly all the infections linked to the sprawling Xinfadi fresh food market in the southwestern Fengtai district.“The large amounts of samples found in the Xinfadi wholesale market indicate that the virus has been around for some time. If it had only just arrived in the city for a short period of time, there may not have been so many positive samples found; however, we need more data before making an informed decision about its origin,” the CDC official Zhang said.The first case in this new outbreak was reported on June 11, leading city authorities to reimpose a level two alert days after it had been lowered to the level three, or the least, alert on June 6.Beijing authorities acted quickly to curb infection risks in the capital, shutting down and disinfecting fresh food and wet markets, fencing off dozens of residential communities near the affected markets, restricting travel out of Beijing and carrying out hundreds of thousands of nucleic acid tests.Beijing is under a restricted lockdown with three categories of people not allowed to leave.The first category includes confirmed Covid-19 patients, suspected cases, close contacts, asymptomatic carriers and people with fever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-covid-19-strain-could-have-come-from-europe-says-chinese-expert/story-UuLcpKhu4JILG12PBnBAgN.html

The government’s plan is working. Infection rates are rapidly falling, we have protected the NHS and, thanks to the hard work of millions in our health and social care services, we are getting the country back on her feet.”The update says: “The Joint Biosecurity Centre has recommended that the Covid-19 alert level should move from Level 4 (A Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation; transmission is high or rising exponentially) to Level 3 (A Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation)”.“There has been a steady decrease in cases we have seen in all four nations, and this continues. It does not mean that the pandemic is over. The virus is still in general circulation, and localised outbreaks are likely to occur”.“We have made progress against the virus thanks to the efforts of the public and we need the public to continue to follow the guidelines carefully to ensure this progress continues”, the update adds.As of June 18, the cumulative figure for deaths in the UK was 42,288 and 300,469 cases.The UK’s five Covid-19 alert levels are:Level 1 Covid-19 is not known to be present in the UK.Level 2 Covid-19 is present in the UK, but the number of cases and transmission is low.Level 3 A Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation.Level 4 A Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation; transmission is high or rising exponentially.Level 5 As level 4 and there is a material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-big-moment-after-dwindling-cases-uk-lowers-alert-level-to-3/story-VmElrHC40MME89d0p2hgbM.html
19-06-2020||World||Donald Trump shrugs off backlash, Covid-19 fears ahead of mass campaign rally||Donald Trump’s decision to pack thousands of people into an arena for his first campaign rally in three months, intended to reinvigorate both his re-election effort and the candidate himself, has instead kept the president on the defensive.The Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally set for Saturday was supposed to signal that America is well on its way back to normal after weathering both the coronavirus outbreak and nationwide protests against police brutality. And the event was just as much about lifting the president’s own morale, following broad criticism of his response to the virus crisis and the unrest, according to officials familiar with the campaign.But instead, the rally has led to new scrutiny of the president’s handling of both the pandemic and the nation’s divisive racial inequities. Health officials in Oklahoma have recommended delaying the event, expected to draw at least 100,000 people to the state’s second-largest city, as cases of Covid-19 rise.Trump already moved the rally back a day after initially scheduling it for Juneteenth, a commemoration of the end of slavery, drawing criticism that he was insensitive to the plight of African Americans. Moreover, Tulsa is the site of one of the worst incidents of racial violence in American history, the 1921 sacking of a prosperous Black neighborhood named Greenwood by a White mob.Rallies were the centerpiece of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and continued through his presidency, providing a platform to reach voters directly, and a trove of voter data. Trump began increasing their frequency late last year -- until the coronavirus forced the campaign to suspend them in March.Undercutting MessageThe virus has damaged Trump’s campaign in another way -- undercutting his message that he should be re-elected because of a booming economy. Social-distancing measures and stay-at-home orders led to the loss of millions of jobs and sent the economy into a tailspin.Polls show Trump trailing Democrat Joe Biden nationally and in key swing states as voters express concern over the president’s handling of the virus and national protests that erupted over instances of police brutality and racism.Yet Trump maintains an advantage over Biden: enthusiasm among his core supporters, reflected in polls and turnout at campaign events. The rallies highlight that difference, people close to the president said.“There’s just a hunger for the rallies. And I enjoy doing them,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday. “It gives energy to everybody. And we have tremendous enthusiasm.”Economic AchievementsTrump’s speech on Saturday will likely highlight the economic achievements of his administration before the pandemic struck.The president will also argue that the best prescription to unite a country amid the nationwide protests and civil unrest is an economic one, according to administration officials.The demonstrations were sparked by outrage over George Floyd, an unarmed Black man who died in the custody of a Minneapolis police officer who knelt into his neck for more than eight minutes.Trump has rejected the idea of systemic racism among police, along with calls by protesters to overhaul law enforcement and cut police funding. Instead, he is backing new training programs as well as economic development and school choice.His campaign is sending more than 50 of its surrogates to the rally, including a large contingent representing the campaign’s outreach initiative called “Black Voices for Trump.”But Oklahoma is a securely red state and its Black population is just 7.8%, below the national average.Paris Dennard, a senior communications adviser at the Republican National Committee, defended Trump’s initial decision to hold the rally on Juneteenth. He said the media took a “negative” view of the choice, but that he and other Black campaign and White House officials officials were supportive.Dennard said they saw the rally date as an opportunity for Trump to highlight both the holiday and “Black Wall Street,” another name for Tulsa’s Greenwood District, which was a beacon of Black wealth before it was wiped out by White mobs.President’s ‘Vision’The economic element “fits into the president’s vision for” Black Americans, Dennard said. “When it was decided” that the rally would be held on June 19, “we said ‘Well, we can make this work.’”Trump has said he’s eager to resume the rallies. In remarks alongside Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt at a White House event about reopening small businesses on Thursday, Trump boasted of the audience he’s likely to draw.“We’re going to be in Oklahoma and its a crowd like I guess nobody has seen before,” Trump said. “We have tremendous requests for tickets, like I think, probably politically has never happened before.”Biden has largely been confined to his home in Delaware and has not held many public campaign events because of the pandemic. A June 8 CNN poll showed that Trump’s supporters are more enthusiastic to vote for him in November than those who plan to vote for Biden.Trailing BidenTrump trails Biden by an average of 8.5 percentage points, nationally, according to the average of polls compiled by RealClear Politics.The campaign said more than 1 million tickets have been requested and has tweeted pictures of people who started lining up for the event earlier this week.The rally will be held the BOK Center, an indoor arena that has capacity of about 20,000 people. Local officials expect an overflow crowd of perhaps 80,000 more people, including 35,000 in a nearby convention center and thousands in the streets.The event is moving forward despite concern raised by epidemiologists and local health officials that there’s been a spike in cases in Tulsa and that indoor events are ideal for transmitting the coronavirus. The state has recommended attendees get virus tests before and after the rally.Downplaying Safety ConcernsBut campaign officials downplayed safety concerns, saying they’ll conduct temperature checks, and offer masks and hand sanitizer to those attending as a precaution against spreading the virus. But masks won’t be required.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany in a briefing this week, defended Trump’s move to hold a rally during the pandemic, comparing it to the Floyd protests. McEnany complained of a double standard, criticism of Trump for holding the rally but not of the protests with people marching shoulder-to-shoulder in the streets.A spokeswoman for the BOK Center, Meghan Blood, said in a statement that it had asked the campaign for a plan “detailing the steps the event will institute for health and safety, including those related to social distancing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-shrugs-off-backlash-covid-19-fears-ahead-of-mass-campaign-rally/story-RUXrUyyvZ5glViPM9nEfVN.html
19-06-2020||World||Covid-19 was circulating in Italy in December 2019, says study||Scientists in Italy have found traces of the new coronavirus in wastewater collected from Milan and Turin in December 2019 - suggesting Covid-19 was already circulating in Northern Italy before China reported the first cases.The Italian National Institute of Health looked at 40 sewage samples collected from wastewater treatment plants in northern Italy between October 2019 and February 2020. An analysis released late on Thursday said samples taken in Milan and Turin on December 18 showed the presence of the SARS-Cov-2 virus.“This research may help us understand the beginning of virus circulation in Italy,” Giuseppina La Rosa, an expert in environmental wastewater at the Italian National Institute of Health who co-led the research, said in a statement detailing the findings.Small studies conducted by scientific teams in the Netherlands, France, Australia and elsewhere have found signs that the virus that causes Covid-19 can be detected in sewage, and many countries are beginning to use wastewater sampling to track the spread of the disease.La Rosa said the detection of traces of the virus before the end of 2019 was consistent with evidence emerging in other countries that Covid-19 may have been circulating before China reported the first cases of a new disease on December 31.A study in May by French scientists found that a man was infected with Covid-19 as early as December 27, nearly a month before France confirmed its first cases.La Rosa said the presence of the virus in the Italian waste samples did not “automatically imply that the main transmission chains that led to the development of the epidemic in our country originated from these very first cases”.Samples positive for traces of the virus that causes Covid-19 were also found in sewage from Bologna, Milan and Turin in January and February 2020. Samples taken in October and November 2019 tested negative.The institute said it plans to launch a pilot study in July to monitor wastewater at sites identified in tourist resorts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-was-circulating-in-italy-in-december-2019-says-study/story-Cbq4yMsydEgthiZef9XSVN.html

There are no approved vaccines or treatments for the illness caused by the new coronavirus, but about a dozen vaccines are being trialled globally as drugmakers and governments scramble to combat the health crisis. Clover said initial safety data from the study was expected in August this year, and it would target to start broader studies by the end of this year. China now accounts for almost half of the clinical trials testing Covid-19 vaccines, including candidates from CanSino Biological, and Sinopharm and the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products.GSK, the world’s largest vaccine maker, on Friday underscored its commitment to backing a conventional immunisation approach. It has mainly acted as a contributor of adjuvants, or efficacy boosters, that are combined with proteins called antigens that help build immunity.Clover and the British drugmaker began their collaboration for a coronavirus vaccine in February this year and the Chinese firm partnered with Dynavax the following month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sixth-trial-of-potential-chinese-covid-19-shot-begins-with-gsk-dynavax-mix/story-GJq7REWODNVfQiPYu6KD7O.html
19-06-2020||World||Draft UN resolution calls for three aid crossings to Syria amid Covid outbreak||A draft UN resolution would maintain two border crossing points from Turkey to deliver humanitarian aid to Syria’s mainly rebel-held northwest and reopen an Iraqi crossing to the northeast to deliver medical supplies for the Covid-19 pandemic.Russia, which insisted the Iraqi crossing be shut in January, holds the key to future cross-border operations. It contends cross-border aid was meant to be a temporary response to the nine-year Syrian conflict and the situation on the ground has changed.The proposed Security Council resolution, drafted by Belgium and Germany and obtained Thursday by The Associated Press, emphasises that 11 million Syrians need aid and that cross-border deliveries remain “an urgent and temporary solution” to help them.It states that the pandemic presents “a profound challenge to Syria’s health system, socio-economic and humanitarian situations” and “heightens the imperative of using every possible means of reaching people in need”.In January, Russia scored a victory for its close ally Syria, using its veto threat to force the Security Council to adopt a resolution reducing the number of crossing points for aid deliveries from four to just two, from Turkey to the northwest. It also cut in half the year-long mandate that had been in place since cross-border deliveries began in 2014 to six months, as Russia insisted.The newly circulated draft resolution would extend the mandate for the two border crossings from Turkey to the northwest - Bab al-Salam and Bab al-Hawa - for a year. And it would reopen the Al Yarubiyah crossing from Iraq for an initial period of six months until January 10, 2021, and for an additional six-month period if the council decides the impact of the pandemic warrants it after evaluating a report to be done by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.Last month, UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock called the northwest border operation “a lifeline for millions of civilians whom the UN cannot reach by other means”, saying deliveries are at record levels with 1,365 trucks crossing from Turkey in April.Al Yarubiyah had been used mainly to deliver medical supplies to the northeast and while a first road delivery from Syria made it to the region in May, UN officials say the crossing from Iraq is essential to bring in Covid-19 supplies.Human Rights Watch’s UN Director Louis Charbonneau said its research in late April showed that restrictions on aid from Damasus and Iraq were preventing medical supplies and personnel from reaching two million people in the northeast, where there were dozens of confirmed Covid-19 cases in May and at least three deaths.“The UN Security Council - including Russia - needs to act quickly to reauthorise medical aid deliveries from Iran to Syria’s northeast to prevent further spread of Covid-19 that could devastate the region,” Charbonneau said, stressing that alternatives to Al Yarubiyah proposed by Russia and others “have failed to close the gap”.Whether Russia will allow the Al Yarubiyah reopening remains to be seen. The current mandate for the two Turkish crossings ends on July 10, and the Security Council hasn’t yet engaged in serious discussions on the Belgian-German draft resolution.Last month, Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said in response to Lowcock and calls by US Ambassador Kelly Craft for the Iraq crossing to be opened: “Do not waste your time on efforts to reopen the closed cross-border points.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/draft-un-resolution-calls-for-three-aid-crossings-to-syria-amid-covid-outbreak/story-Qi0JE0uINHbtRR8WV3V6VL.html

Some Democrats took issue with her record on police misconduct and other prosecutions.Klobuchar, who competed against Biden for the party’s presidential nomination before endorsing him, said she spoke with Biden on Wednesday night.Biden late on Thursday praised Klobuchar’s “grit and determination” on Twitter and said that “with your help, we’re going to beat Donald Trump.”Biden has already promised to pick a woman as his running mate, and several black candidates are on his short list, including Senator Kamala Harris and Representative Val Demings. He has also considered candidates of other backgrounds, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is white.Some African-American leaders and activists have said that a black woman on the ticket would help demonstrate to black voters, a crucial component of the Democratic base, that Biden is committed to addressing issues such as criminal justice reform and police misconduct.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amy-klobuchar-pulls-back-from-consideration-as-joe-biden-s-running-mate/story-4SomRocs52pgJGiLQjoWJI.html
19-06-2020||World||After US Supreme Court’s blow to Trump on DACA, what next for immigrants?||The US Supreme Court on Thursday gave a stunning rebuke to President Donald Trump in the midst of his re-election bid by rejecting his efforts to end legal protections for thousands of immigrants.The court ruled 5-4 against Trump’s move to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) programme that offers work permits and deportation relief to certain immigrants who came to the country illegally as children.What is DACA?The DACA programme was created by former US President Barack Obama in 2012. It prevents deportation of people who arrived in the United States of America as minors.It was rescinded by President Trump in September but gave the Congress time to come out with a policy in six months to decide on the fate of nearly 7,00,000 individuals, many of whom are Indian or South Asian descent.However, a report in American publication The Hill said that the court’s decision does not prevent the Trump administration from working to rescind the DACA programme in the future, meaning the fate of the deportation reprieve could be decided by voters in the November general election.What happens next?The ruling, authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, sent the issue back to the US Department of Homeland Security for further consideration, concluding that the administration did not provide sufficient reasoning to end DACA.The decision deemed the Trump administration’s actions in seeking to rescind DACA “arbitrary and capricious” in violation of a federal law that governs regulatory changes.A senior Department of Homeland Security official said the agency was reviewing the ruling.What about new applicants?The US Supreme Court ruling means that the roughly 6,49,000 immigrants, now enrolled in DACA will remain protected from deportation and eligible to obtain renewable two-year work permits. Lower courts had blocked Trump’s 2017 action so the programme remained in effect, though the administration refused to process new applications.California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, whose state was among the challengers that sued to try to preserve DACA, said the ruling could reopen the programme “to anyone who qualifies,” but that legal processes in lower courts were still ongoing that could determine whether new applications must be processed by the government.Trump promised as a candidate in 2016 to end DACA, which he called one of Obama’s “illegal executive amnesties,” and has pursued hardline immigration policies but could face election risks if he again tries to rescind it.Meanwhile, the South Asian groups in the US have welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision. “Although it is conditional, today’s victory is welcome at a time when the war on Black communities feels endless,” said Lakshmi Sridaran, executive director of South Asian Americans Leading Together or SAALT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-us-supreme-court-s-blow-to-trump-on-daca-what-next-for-immigrants/story-MuhEsG6kxBcTH7MHPpJa4M.html

19-06-2020||World||Pink eye may be primary symptom of Covid-19: Study||While coughing, fever and difficulty in breathing are common symptoms of Covid-19, a new case study has found that pink eye is also a reason to be tested for the disease. The study, published in the Canadian Journal of Ophthalmology, determined that conjunctivitis and keratoconjunctivitis can also be primary symptoms of Covid-19. The researchers noted that in March, a 29-year-old woman arrived at the Royal Alexandra Hospital’s Eye Institute of Alberta with a severe case of conjunctivitis and minimal respiratory symptoms. After the patient had undergone several days of treatment with little improvement -- and after it had been determined that the woman had recently returned home from Asia -- a resident ordered a Covid-19 test. The test came back positive, according to the researchers. “What is interesting in this case, and perhaps very different to how it had been recognised at that specific time, was that the main presentation of the illness was not a respiratory symptom. It was the eye,” said Carlos Solarte, an assistant professor at the University of Alberta in Canada. “There was no fever and no cough, so we weren’t led to suspect Covid-19 at the beginning. We didn’t know it could present primarily with the eye and not with the lungs,” Solarte said. Academic studies at the outset of the pandemic identified conjunctivitis as a secondary symptoms in about 10 to 15 per cent of Covid-19 cases, he said. Since then, scientists have gained greater knowledge of how the virus can transmit through and affect the body’s mucous membrane system, of which the conjunctiva -- the clear, thin membrane that covers the front surface of the eye -- is an extension. While the finding provides important new health information for the public, it also makes eye exams more complicated for ophthalmologists and staff, the researchers noted. “The patient in this case eventually recovered well without any issues. But several of the residents and staff who were in close contact with the patient had to be under quarantine,” said Solarte. “Fortunately, none who were involved in her care also tested positive,” he said.

The Hong Kong Journalists Association said a survey of members revealed 98% disagreed with the laws.Reporters Without Borders -- known by its French acronym RSF -- had previously said the new laws “will make it easier for the authoritarian Chinese regime to trample on rights, including press freedom, that are supposed to be guaranteed in the former British colony under the ‘one country, two systems’ principle until 2047.”Press FreedomThe more specific concerns about the potential threats to journalists also come amid longer-standing concerns about the ability of media workers to operate freely in Hong Kong, which is the regional base for many international news organizations.Chief Executive Carrie Lam in April backed a city agency’s criticism of public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong for questioning Taiwan’s exclusion from world health bodies, a move that followed an earlier critique by pro-Beijing groups of one of the network’s political satire shows.A month earlier, as part of broader tit-for-tat retaliation between the US and China, Beijing kicked out a group of American correspondents based in the Chinese capital and specified that none of them would be able to take up work in Hong Kong -- which is supposed to have a separate immigration system.The move prompted Hong Kong’s Foreign Correspondents’ Club to question whether the city still had control of its immigration policy, saying in a statement that any change would mark “a serious erosion” of the “one country, two systems” principle by which China governs the city.Two years ago, Hong Kong denied a visa renewal for Financial Times journalist Victor Mallet after he hosted an event at the club featuring the founder of a banned pro-independence party.RSF on Friday detailed how China uses existing laws barring terrorism, secession, subversion and foreign interference to go after journalists.With no details on the news laws yet available, the group said local journalists in Hong Kong could conceivably be accused of terrorism for reporting from the scene of a violent protest, of secession for writing about Hong Kong’s independence movement or of subversion for running an anti-government opinion piece.Foreign correspondents or employees of foreign outlets, meanwhile, could also be accused of interference by foreign powers, the group said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-security-law-threatens-hong-kong-journalists-says-media-watchdog/story-Uq1WRpvE5hDZr5ceOuKXGJ.html
19-06-2020||World||Palestinians fear displacement from an annexed Jordan Valley||For generations, the people of Fasayil herded animals on the desert bluffs and palm-shaded lowlands of the Jordan Valley. Today, nearly every man in the Palestinian village works for Jewish settlers in the sprawling modern farms to the north and south.The grazing lands to the west and east, leading down to the banks of the biblical Jordan River, have been swallowed up by the settlements or fenced off by the Israeli military. So instead of leading sheep out to pasture, the men rise before dawn to work in the settlements for around $3 an hour — or they move away.“Everyone here works in the settlements, there’s nothing else,” said Iyad Taamra, a member of the village council who runs a small grocery store. “If you have some money you go somewhere else where there is a future.”Palestinians fear communities across the Jordan Valley will meet a similar fate if Israel proceeds with its plans to annex the territory, which accounts for around a quarter of the occupied West Bank and was once seen as the breadbasket of a future Palestinian state.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to annex the valley and all of Israel’s far-flung West Bank settlements, in line with President Donald Trump’s Middle East plan, which overwhelmingly favours Israel and has been rejected by the Palestinians. The process could begin as soon as July 1.Netanyahu has said Israel will annex the land but not the people who rely on it, telling an Israeli newspaper they will remain in an “enclave” under limited self-rule, with Israel maintaining security control.Few if any Palestinians would be given citizenship, leaving their legal status uncertain. In a region that heavily relies on agriculture, the loss of farm and grazing land could force many to relocate.Shaul Arieli, a retired Israeli military commander who worked on border demarcation during the peace process in the 1990s, estimates that the Palestinians would lose up to 70,000 acres (280 square kilometers) of private land. He expects Israel will carve out a new 200-kilometer (124-mile) border between the Jordan Valley and the rest of the West Bank, and a 60-kilometer (37-mile) border around the Palestinian city of Jericho.He based his conclusions on maps presented by Netanyahu and the White House, which show Israel extending sovereignty over large swaths of land while leaving most populated areas outside its borders.Itay Epshtain, a special adviser to the Norwegian Refugee Council, said Palestinians would lose some of the limited protections they have, once Israeli courts are no longer formally obliged to consider international laws related to military occupation.“Palestinians void of civil status in Israel, and not coming under the authority of the military commander, would neither have standing in the High Court nor the ability to challenge decisions of the government,” he said.The Jordan Valley is home to around 60,000 Palestinians, according to the UN, but nearly 90% of the land is part of what is known as Area C, the three-fifths of the West Bank that is under complete Israeli control. In the Jordan Valley, it includes closed military areas and around 50 agricultural settlements housing some 12,000 Israelis.Palestinians are barred from those areas, and even on the lands they own, they are forbidden from digging wells or building any kind of infrastructure without hard-to-get military permits. From 2009 until 2016, less than 2% of more than 3,300 permit applications in Area C were successful, according to Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement group, citing official statistics.Anything built without a permit, from home extensions to tents, animal pens and irrigation networks, is at risk of demolition by the Israeli military.“If you dig a well they will come the next day and fill it with concrete,” said Hani Saida, a farmer from the town of al-Auja. “They may annex this area, but they will never give us equal rights. They’ll keep trying to drive us away.”COGAT, the Israeli military body that oversees civilian affairs in the West Bank, declined to comment.Abdul-Malik al-Jaber, a Canadian-Palestinian businessman and the chairman of a large company that exports dates from the Jordan Valley, says the process of obtaining permits is a “nightmare,” even for big investors.“There’s no way on earth a normal, simple farmer can afford the cost and the complications,” he said.Al-Jaber said his company has spent the last two months and around $35,000 trying to secure a permit to build a modern date-packing plant on land he owns. He was told the Israeli military considers it a training area, even though farmers live there and work the land.He fears annexation will only make things more difficult, by cutting off workers from the company’s fields and factories and further complicating the export process.Israel’s annexation plans have sparked an international outcry, with European and Arab countries warning that it would violate international law and threaten any remaining hopes for a two-state solution.But in the Jordan Valley and elsewhere in the West Bank the response has been more muted.“From 1967 until today, water for drinking, water for agriculture, the border, the crossings, the roads, the government lands in Area C between the villages and the cities, the entrances to the towns — all of them are under Israeli control,” said Mohannad Saida, a cousin of Hani.“Nothing is going to change,” he said.He said his family owns around 750 acres (3 square kilometers) north of al-Auja, stretching to the banks of the Jordan River. They fled during the 1967 war, when Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and their land was sealed off as a military zone.Over the years, they would drive into the hills to look down over the land. About 15 years ago, they noticed rows of freshly planted date trees, an extension of a nearby settlement.A few years later, a relative who worked as a bulldozer driver was able to enter the area for an Israeli construction project. He took pictures of the mud-brick homes where their ancestors had been born and raised.“We saw our mud houses,” Saida said. “They are still standing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-fear-displacement-from-an-annexed-jordan-valley/story-LzZTHhGPno1UZXSAANZ0PL.html

We lost a lot of things with this virus, including empathy,” said journalist Maria Trigo, from the newspaper El Deber de Santa Cruz, in a Twitter message.Fabiola Chambi, a journalist with the Cochabamba daily Los Tiempos said broadcasting the death showed “a lack of respect and humanity.”The government has yet to comment on the controversy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/outrage-after-bolivian-tv-broadcasts-covid-19-death/story-VQewOBvjBwUI3nKWjjCA7H.html

19-06-2020||World||No going back to lockdown in US, world will have Covid-19 vaccine soon: Fauci||The United States does not need more widespread lockdowns to bring its Covid-19 outbreak under control, despite the fact that the national daily infection rate has stayed flat, leading government expert Anthony Fauci said Thursday.Speaking to AFP, the physician-scientist added he was optimistic the world would soon have a vaccine that would end the pandemic, calling early trial results “encouraging.”“I don’t think we’re going to be talking about going back to lockdown,” he said when asked whether places like California and Texas that are seeing a surge in their caseload should reissue stay-at-home orders.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here“I think we’re going to be talking about trying to better control those areas of the country that seem to be having a surge of cases.”The US leads the world in the number of confirmed infections and in deaths, with the fatality toll approaching 120,000.But while former epicenters New York and New Jersey have controlled their outbreaks, the virus is now increasing in 20 states -- creating a plateau in the national case graph. Fauci stressed a localized approach as the country returns to normal -- including on the crucial question of when to reopen schools. “Counties where there are certainly no cases at all, there’s no problem with the schools opening,” he said.“There are other parts where there’s a modest amount of infection (where) you may delay school openings.”For those regions in between, “you want to make some modification of the process, namely: alternate days, morning versus afternoon, seating people apart from each other wearing masks.”Click here for complete coronavirus coverage On the question of re-opening the country’s borders, he struck a cautious note. “Obviously, there is an interest in getting back to some form of normality in our interactions with other countries,” he said, adding the topic was reviewed almost daily but refusing to give a timeline.The 79-year-old has led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, and has overseen the nation’s response to every epidemic from HIV onward.A growing issue however has been a loss of public faith in science, especially during the current crisis.“Even when the recommendations are to wear a mask, a recommendation that I’ve been involved in making, there are some groups that actually do the recommendations very strictly,” said Fauci.“And then... you see pictures of people in bars and in congregations without that. So again, it’s a mixed bag.”- ‘Nature’s proof of concept’ -Many within the scientific community have described the development of a vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 virus as a “Moonshot” given there has never been a successful vaccine for any human coronavirus.Then there is the fact that scientists have failed to develop a vaccine for HIV, despite trying for decades. Fauci stressed that the two weren’t comparable.“The reason I have more confidence with coronavirus is that we know the majority of people recover from COVID-19 because their immune system clears the virus,” he said.“So nature has already given you a proof of concept that it can be done.”Since people who recover produce virus-fighting antibodies, scientists are confident that these antibodies can also be elicited by a man-made antigen.Fauci added he was “cautiously optimistic” about the National Institutes of Health’s early animal studies on the Moderna vaccine, as well as early results from the human study which produced “encouraging” neutralizing antibodies.But he added that just because the Moderna vaccine and another produced by Oxford University appeared to be “temporally ahead,” it did not mean their final results would be the best.On the treatment front, Fauci said he was “very impressed” with results from a British trial into the steroid dexamethasone, which was found to reduce deaths among Covid-19 patients on ventilators by a third.However, given it works by suppressing the abnormal immune response that damages the body’s organs, rather than attacking the virus, Fauci cautioned it should not be prescribed too soon after a person was infected.“It had no effect, if not maybe even a suggestion of making things worse early on,” he said.“This is perfectly compatible with knowing that early on in infection, you need the immune system to suppress the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-going-back-to-lockdown-in-us-world-will-have-covid-19-vaccine-soon-fauci/story-vnCZisedy2bK6rgQZrgXaO.html
19-06-2020||World||UN seeks urgent funding for coronavirus pandemic aid transport||The United Nations food agency warned Thursday that without immediate funding its global transport system will stop delivering thousands of tonnes of masks, gloves and other critical equipment to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic to 132 countries by the third week of July.Amer Daoudi, the World Food Program’s director of operations and Covid-19 response, told a video press conference that its aircraft have also transported 2,600 humanitarian and health workers free of charge to 40 destinations across Africa, Asia and the Middle East since the pandemic began, and that service will also come to a halt.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“As the virus continues to accelerate across many parts of the world, as we are seeing, these services become more and more vital and important,” he said.To meet the demand, he said the Rome-based WFP requested $965 million to sustain its transport services through 2020.But so far it has received about $132 million — only 14 percent — even though “the Covid-19 virus is not slowing down” and “the entire humanitarian and health community is relying on WFP’s logistic services now more than ever,” Daoudi said.“WFP services are expanding and demand is increasing. However, the funding is not,” he said. “With this funding level, the WFP common services will come to a standstill by the third week of July.” Daoudi said WFP has eight Covid-19 response hubs around the world connected by a global network of air and sea transport that so far have dispatched 15,000 cubic meters (about 530,000 cubic feet) of critical items to tackle the coronavirus to 132 countries on behalf of health and humanitarian organizations.He said, for example, that one cubic meter (about 35 cubic feet) contains “around 32,500 surgical masks, 1,650 safety goggles, 1,800 face shields and/or 30,000 examination gloves.” Daoudi said 70,000 cubic meters (about 2.47 million cubic feet) of cargo are in the pipeline to be transported over the next six weeks on behalf of more than 30 organizations. To do that, he said, between 120 and 130 large 747 cargo planes are needed, because each can only carry 650 cubic meters (about 23,000 cubic feet).“And this is only the tip of the iceberg,” he said. “Moving beyond the next six weeks the demand is quite huge and we are talking about delivering to over 132 different countries across the globe, so the urgency is there, the needs are there.” D aoudi said “projections indicate that approximately upwards of 700,000 cubic meters (almost 25 million cubic feet) of cargo will need to be delivered across the world by the end of the year.” But he said that will be impossible unless WFP receives $820 million to continue its Covid-19 logistics service through 2020.Daoudi welcomed “generous donations of air transport capacity” from the United Arab Emirates and the European Union as part of its air bridge, and said WFP is in discussions with NATO, the United Kingdom and other countries about offering air assets. WFP’s two strategic hubs for Covid-19 deliveries are in Guangzhou, China and Liège, Belgium, along with six regional hubs in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Accra, Ghana; Johannesburg, South Africa; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Panama, he said.Daoudi said WFP has been providing passenger transport services for health and humanitarian workers where safe and reliable commercial options are not available.“WFP is working to open more passenger routes in Latin America and add destinations throughout Africa, Asia and the Middle East,” he said. “The moment there are commercial viable options WFP will stand down its services.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-seeks-urgent-funding-for-pandemic-aid-transport/story-LTbac6x92ov2ND0ZUrwb2J.html

According to a survey by the ministry, about 40% of projects have seen little adverse impact, and another 30-40% have been somewhat affected, said Wang Xiaolong, director-general of the ministry’s International Economic Affairs Department, at a news briefing in Beijing.“About 20% percent of the projects have been seriously affected,” he said. Wang did not give any details.The results from the survey were better than expected and although some projects had been put on hold, China had not heard of any major projects being cancelled, he added.Over 100 countries have signed agreements with China to cooperate in BRI projects like railways, ports, highways and other infrastructure. According to a Refinitiv database, over 2,600 projects at a cost of $3.7 trillion are linked to the initiative.Restrictions on travel and the flow of goods across borders, as well as local measures to combat Covid-19, were the main reasons for the impacts on projects, said Wang. “As the situation improves we have confidence that the projects will come back and the execution of them will speed up,” he said.The challenge of the pandemic to BRI projects follows a pushback in 2018, when officials in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and elsewhere criticized projects there as costly and unnecessary.China scaled back some plans after several countries sought to review, cancel or scale down commitments, citing concerns over costs, erosion of sovereignty, and corruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-fifth-of-belt-and-road-projects-seriously-affected-by-covid-19-pandemic-china/story-XvmSgYmh2eXy3wYT6GLOAK.html
19-06-2020||World||Putin insists on recognition of USSR’s WWII role||In a lengthy article in a US journal, Russian President Vladimir Putin insists on recognition of the Soviet Union as the prime defeater of Nazi Germany, criticizes Poland’s actions before the war and defends the annexation of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.The article, titled “The Real Lessons of the 75th Anniversary of World War II,” appeared in the National Interest journal on Thursday, six days before a huge military parade in Red Square to commemorate the end of World War II in Europe.The timing underlines how the war, in which the Soviet Union lost an estimated 27 million people, is a linchpin of Russia’s national identity and how officials bristle at any questioning of the USSR’s role.“It is essential to pass on to future generations the memory of the fact that the Nazis were defeated first and foremost by the Soviet people,” Putin wrote. He bemoaned that “certain politicians rushed to claim that Russia was trying to rewrite history.” Poland and Russia frequently butt heads over who is to blame for starting the war, and Putin took up the issue in the article.“The blame for the tragedy that Poland then suffered lies entirely with the Polish leadership, which had impeded the formation of a military alliance between Britain, France and the Soviet Union and relied on the help from its Western partners, throwing its own people under the steamroller of Hitler’s machine of destruction,” Putin wrote.Putin reiterated the contention that the Soviet Union was forced into signing a non-aggression agreement with Germany before the war — the so-called Molotov-Ribbentrop pact — after Western powers cold-shouldered creating a military alliance.“The Soviet Union did its utmost to use every chance of creating an anti-Hitler coalition. Despite — I will say it again — the double dealing on the part of the Western countries,” he wrote.He also defended the wartime annexation of the Baltic nations.“Their accession to the USSR was implemented on a contractual basis, with the consent of the elected authorities. This was in line with international and state law of that time,” he said. “The Baltic republics within the USSR preserved their government bodies, language, and had representation in the higher state structures of the Soviet Union.” “I believe that it is unacceptable to equate liberators with occupiers,” he said.He concluded by suggesting that a prime lesson of the war is the necessity of broad international diplomacy. He expressed hope that a Russia-proposed summit of the leaders of the U.N. Security Council’s veto-holding countries would take place soon to discuss global security, the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and other issues.“There can be no doubt that the summit of Russia, China, France, the United States and the UK can play an important role in finding common answers to modern challenges,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-insists-on-recognition-of-ussr-s-wwii-role/story-5afWXkT5L4SIqlPQO0A2IJ.html
19-06-2020||World||Canada to introduce Covid-19 tracing app in July||Canada is introducing a contact tracing smartphone app that will notify Canadians of exposure to the new coronavirus.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday the app will be voluntary and that if someone tests positive, other users who have the app and have been in proximity will then be alerted they’ve been exposed to someone who has tested positive. Trudeau said privacy will be respected.“At no time will personal information be collected or shared, and no location services will be used,” Trudeau said.Governments around the world have been turning to smartphone technology to help battle fresh virus flare-ups as they ease lockdown restrictions. But technical problems and privacy concerns have dogged the development of virus tracing apps.Health authorities in Britain announced Thursday they are scrapping plans to launch their own coronavirus contact tracing smartphone app because of technical problems and will now work on building one using technology supplied by Apple and Google.Other European nations such as Switzerland, Germany and Italy, are using a “decentralized” approach based on the Apple-Google smartphone interface, which experts say is better for privacy because it keeps data on phones.“We drew lessons from what other people did around the world,” Trudeau said. “This type of simple and anonymous application, that is entirely voluntary, will be extremely powerful in terms of helping us to reopen the economy safely.” Ontario will soon begin testing the app which is being developed with the help of Canadian technology companies Shopify and BlackBerry. He said Apple and Google recently put out major upgrades to their operating systems and that the app will be available in July.“It will be up to individual Canadians to decide whether to download the app or not but the app will be most effective when as many people as possible have it,” Trudeau said.He said there are 30 million smartphones in Canada that can take the app, and he hopes over 50 percent download it.“Any amount of people that download it will be useful for that person and for society. But it’s certain that if we can talk about 50% uptake, for example, or more, then it becomes extraordinarily useful,” he said.The prime minister said the app will encourage people to reach out to their local public health authorities.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Canada passed the 100,000 mark on Thursday.

There aren’t too many state-based actors who have those capabilities,” Morrison said.Morrison said he particularly wanted organizations involved in health, critical infrastructure and essential services to bolster technical defences to thwart such malicious attacks.Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said the government’s cyber agency, Australian Cyber Security Center, and the Home Affairs Department had published on Friday a technical advisory on how organizations can detect and mitigate cyber threats.Morrison would not comment on the inevitable speculation that the cyberattacks were part of Australia’s increasingly hostile rift with China.China in recent weeks banned beef exports from Australia’s largest abattoirs, ended trade in Australian barley with a tariff wall and warned its citizens against visiting Australia.The measures are widely interpreted as punishment for Australia’s advocacy of an independent probe into the origins and spread of the coronavirus pandemic.Australia’s foreign minister this week accused China of using the anxiety around the pandemic to undermine Western democracies by spreading disinformation online, prompting China to accuse Australia of disinformation.Morrison said “Australia doesn’t engage lightly in public attribution” and would not name the country behind the current cyber campaign.“I can’t control what speculation others might engage in on this issue,” he said.Morrison said he had discussed the growing cyber security threat with Australia’s allies and had spoken overnight to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the subject.Australian investigations to date had not uncovered any “large-scale personal data breaches,” Morrison said.Australian cyber security authorities had “thwarted many” attacks,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-leader-says-unnamed-state-increasing-cyberattacks/story-ZsWxvORfZQFCIDm1NQiOWJ.html
19-06-2020||World||Japan lifts Covid-19 travel curbs to help economy bounce back||Japan lifted all coronavirus-related curbs on domestic travel on Friday, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe calling on people to go sightseeing or attend concerts and other events to help the nation’s economy bounce back from a pandemic recession.Japan began lifting its pandemic lockdown in May as coronavirus infections fell. The latest easing on Thursday comes after the end of an emergency declaration that allowed people to return to work and for bars and restaurants implementing social distancing measures to reopen.“I would like people, while observing social distancing, to go out on sightseeing trips. We would like you to make an effort to engage in social and economic activity,” Abe said in an address to the country late on Thursday.The end of a government advisory for people to stay put in infected prefectures or avoid travelling to them should help hotels, resorts and areas that rely heavily on tourism. Any recovery, however, may be slow because many people are still avoiding crowds and most travel to Japan is still restricted. Only 1,700 foreigners arrived in Japan in May, the lowest number for that time of year since 1964, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization.Japan’s two big airlines, ANA Holdings and Japan Airlines Co., say they are restarting some domestic flights as demand picks up, but both say flight schedules by July will still only be half of what they had planned before the coronavirus pandemic. In addition to ending the domestic travel advisory, Japan is also allowing up to 1,000 people to gather at indoor and outdoor events. Japanese professional baseball teams will also restart games on Friday, although spectators will be locked out.Japan by Thursday had recorded 17,789 cases of the novel coronavirus with 948 deaths, according to public broadcaster NHK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-lifts-covid-19-travel-curbs-to-help-economy-bounce-back/story-tqtgiUfZLVZFfikj58kWIO.html
19-06-2020||World||US drops planned limit for toxin that damages infant brains||The Trump administration on Thursday rejected imposing federal drinking-water limits for a chemical used in fireworks and other explosives and linked to brain damage in newborns, opting to override Obama administration findings that the neurotoxin was contaminating the drinking water of millions of Americans.The contaminant is perchlorate, a component in rocket fuel, ammunition and other explosives, including fireworks. The Associated Press found one high-profile example of that on Thursday, reviewing a 2016 US Geological Survey report that ties high levels of perchlorate contamination in the water at Mount Rushmore national memorial in South Dakota with past years of fireworks displays there.While officials stopped the fireworks shows at the Black Hills memorial a decade ago, the pyrotechnics are scheduled to resume this Independence Day holiday at the urging of President Donald Trump, who plans to attend the festivities on July 3.His administration has rolled back or eliminated scores of existing or pending public health and environmental protections, and the latest example came Thursday when Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the government would not move forward on setting the first mandatory federal limits for perchlorate in drinking water.The rollbacks have targeted Obama-era initiatives in particular, with the Trump administration saying the regulations are burdensome to business and are unnecessary.Wheeler said in a statement the decision to drop the introduction of federal limits for perchlorate fulfill’s Trump’s “promise to pare back burdensome ‘one-size-fits-all’ overregulation for the American people.” Perchlorate from runoff contaminates the drinking water of as many as 16 million Americans, the Obama administration said in 2011 when it announced the EPA would act to set maximum limits for perchlorate for the first time.Perchlorate can damage the development of fetuses and children and cause measurable drops in IQ in newborns, the American Academy of Pediatrics said last August in urging the “strongest possible” federal limits.Erik Olson of the Natural Resources Defense Council advocacy group said the EPA’s decision Thursday was “illegal, unscientific and unconscionable.” An earlier court-ordered consent decree, set after Olson’s group accused the EPA of slow-walking the then-planned regulation, gave the agency until this month to set a maximum limit for perchlorate. The organization said Thursday it planned a legal challenge to the EPA’s decision to drop the proposed regulation.The EPA said last year it was looking at four options, including a limit for perchlorate in drinking water far higher than those that California, Massachusetts and other states are currently adopting. Another option was dropping the proposal to regulate perchlorate entirely, based on the contention that “perchlorate does not occur in public water systems with a frequency, and at a level of public health concern.” Wheeler said federal regulation was not warranted now partly because of the steps that some states and public drinking water systems have taken to reduce perchlorate contamination.The EPA required some nationwide testing for perchlorate in drinking water only from 2001 to 2005, making it impossible to determine how severe a problem remains nationally, Olson said.But Trump’s EPA says it looked at some of the limited local testing done for perchlorate, including 15 water systems in a total of 12 states. It said the monitoring found levels of the rocket fuel chemical had declined in some of them.Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement that the EPA “abdicated its responsibility to set federal drinking water standards for a chemical long known to be unsafe, instead leaving it up to states to decide whether or not to protect people from it.” With the Mount Rushmore fireworks a few weeks away, a National Parks Service assessment has concluded there would be no environmental harm from reviving the annual fireworks display, parks service spokeswoman Alexandra Picavet said.But the agency’s written environmental assessment said workers planned to monitor any increase in perchlorate at Mount Rushmore after the fireworks. If readings change, more analysis “may be necessary to evaluate future events” at Mount Rushmore, the report concluded.The memorial serves 3 million visitors a year and year-round park personnel. Picavet said the water is not the primary water source for visitors and workers, and that treatment removes the perchlorate from Mount Rushmore’s drinking water.The 2016 US Geological Survey report called perchlorate contamination at Mount Rushmore “a major concern of park management.” It said past years’ fireworks displays were the “most probable source” of the contamination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-drops-planned-limit-for-toxin-that-damages-infant-brains/story-fZnfVhum6nyp6LLPsv79MO.html
19-06-2020||World||China’s acts on Indian border meant to take advantage of Covid distractions: US official||China opening multiple fronts like the one on India border may be because of Beijing’s assessment that the world is distracted due to Covid-19 pandemic and it may advantage of it, a top American diplomat said Thursday.Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs David Stilwell made the remark, adding the Trump administration is closely watching the Indo-China situation.The latest Chinese activities with India is similar to Beijing’s past activities on India border including Doklam, Stilwell told reporters during a conference call.“One explanation for (China) creating multiple fronts like this is an assessment in Beijing that the world is distracted and is focused entirely on survival right (now), recovering from the corona pandemic, which then possibly is seen as an opportunity to take advantage of the distraction,” Stillwell said. “I’m not going to offer an official US Government position on that, but there are numerous explanations out there for that (in the public domain),” he said, responding to a question on the aggressive Chinese behaviour with its neighbours, including India.“What we’re doing, we’re obviously watching the India-China border dispute very closely,” Stillwell said, during the conference call after the Hawaii meeting between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi to exchange views on bilateral relations and coronavirus pandemic. “This activity is similar to the activity we’ve seen in the past on border disputes with the PRC (Peoples Republic of China), and again, I would point you to those – I think it was 2015 when Xi Jinping travelled to India the first time,” he said.“The PLA (People’s Liberation Army) invaded this contested area deeper and longer, with more people, than ever before historically. Whether that was a negotiating tactic or just a punch in the nose to demonstrate their superiority, I don’t know,” he said.“But then we saw the Doklam issue down near Bhutan, where we saw similar concerns. I wish I knew. Again, we don’t have a lot of visibility and we don’t have a lot of open dialogue with our Chinese counterparts, and honestly, I’d like to see more of that if we can,” Stillwell said.During the news conference, Stilwell did not confirm if the ongoing Indo-China border clash came up during the Pompeo-Yang talks. But the State Department official did express concern over the recent Chinese behaviour in the region.“The actions that we’ve seen out of the PRC of late -- and you all know this as you watch the beat -- have been not really constructive as we look at India, the South China Sea, Hong Kong issues, and just go around the perimeter. In the periphery things like trade have not lived up to the billing, unfortunately,” Stillwell said.The US seeks a constructive and result-oriented relationship that is fair and reciprocal with China, he said, adding that implies not just conversations but actions.In addition to talks on areas like North Korea, Pompeo during the meeting insisted on the Chinese disclosing all they know about how this pandemic began, to share all the information that they have that leads to saving lives, he said.“This is not about saving face; it’s about saving lives. And we insist that they live up to their agreements with the WHO and with the international health regulations to make open as this is beyond politics,” he said.“We have to understand and assess that, as I talk about a constructive and result-oriented relationship, that the words are fine but will be judged by the deeds. If we have words of peace but we have aggressive actions, then we’re going to have to increase the pressure to manage that,” he said. In this US is not alone, he added.“This is not a US-China event. It’s not a US-China issue. This is China versus lots of others. We just saw a very strong G7 statement on Hong Kong that demonstrates that it’s the world that’s concerned with this behaviour,” he said. “The objective of these talks was to help the Chinese government understand that their actions are actually working against them and that if they come to the table with a reasonable proposal, the US is obviously going to greet it reasonably and look for ways to work toward a positive outcome,” Stillwell said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-acts-on-indian-border-meant-to-take-advantage-of-covid-distractions-us-official/story-Tr2HLj81kNnmTRyT5hhxnL.html

We will remember the soldiers’ families, loved ones, and communities as they grieve,” Pompeo tweeted.Before this, the US said it is “closely monitoring” the situation between India and China after a violent face-off between troops of the two countries at the Line of Actual Control and had extended support to a peaceful resolution of the current situation.“We are closely monitoring the situation between Indian and Chinese forces along the Line of Actual Control. Both India and China have expressed a desire to de-escalate, and we support a peaceful resolution of the current situation,” a state department spokesperson said on Thursday.The spokesperson also referred to a June 2 phone call in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump had discussed the India-China border.“We note the Indian military has announced that 20 soldiers have died, and we offer our condolences to their families. During their phone call on June 2, 2020, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi discussed the situation on the India-China border,” the spokesperson said.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at the daily briefing President Donald Trump is aware of the situation on the India-China border and repeated a statement earlier issued by the state department spokesperson.The state department had earlier slammed the border tensions as a reflection of Chinese aggression going beyond the rhetoric and the House foreign affairs committee had blamed the Chinese for as well.“I am extremely concerned by the ongoing Chinese aggression along the Line of Actual Control on the India-China border,” Eliot Engel, the chairperson of the House foreign affairs committee, had said in a statement in early June.“China is demonstrating once again that it is willing to bully its neighbors rather than resolve conflicts according to international law,” Engel had said.India’s external affairs ministry said that both sides suffered casualties during the face-off and that China had departed from the consensus to respect the LAC in Galwan Valley.The face-off took place on late evening and night of June 15 in Galwan Valley as a result of an attempt by the Chinese troops to “unilaterally change” the status quo during de-escalation in eastern Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-condoles-death-of-indian-soldiers-in-face-off-with-chinese-troops/story-dyc12Xib4EhAFFzEG6vnSN.html

19-06-2020||World||Arrest of ex-aide to Brazilian Prez Bolsonaro’s son another hit for leader||Brazilian authorities on Thursday arrested a man sought as part of an investigation into allegedly suspicious movements of money while working for the son of President Jair Bolsonaro, marking another indirect blow to the embattled leader.Fabrício Queiroz, a former driver for Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro, the president’s son, was arrested as part of a joint operation between public prosecutors of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo states, the Rio prosecutors’ office said in a statement. The probe is into an alleged phantom employee corruption scheme.Images on local television showed police escorting him out of a property in Atibaia, a town in Sao Paulo’s interior. Local media reported the property belongs to Flávio Bolsonaro’s lawyer. Jandir Neto, a prosecutor involved in the case, said in a televised interview with CNN Brasil that it was a legal office, without specifying whose.Flávio Bolsonaro denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer, Frederick Wassef, didn’t respond to messages and calls from The Associated Press. Wassef is frequently seen in the presidential palace and the official residence, most recently yesterday when he attended the swearing-in ceremony of a minister.Bolsonaro was elected in 2018 on a wave of anti-corruption sentiment and with promises to clean up the capital, Brasilia. He’s seen his rejection levels rise as Brazil’s Covid-19 death toll climbed to the second highest in the world, and after the resignation of his popular justice minister, who alleged Bolsonaro sought to interfere politically in the Federal Police.The president said in a live broadcast on his social media channels that Queiroz’s arrest was designed to be a show. He also downplayed the risks for himself.“I am not Queiroz’s lawyer and I am not involved in this case,” Bolsonaro said. “May justice follow its course.”The arrest on Thursday comes on the heels of other probes targeting Bolsonaro’s allies, including activists, lawmakers and businessmen. Authorities on Monday arrested the leader of an activist group that backs Bolsonaro, accusing her of raising funds for anti-democratic actions. Federal Police on Tuesday carried out almost two dozen search warrants as part of the same investigation, and local media reported that the Supreme Court granted access to multiple lawmakers’ private banking records.″There are several investigations and operations from the police and the Supreme Court which are getting closer to Bolsonaro´s inner circle,” Maurício Santoro, a political science professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, said in a text message. “The arrest of Queiroz is big news - and a huge concern for Bolsonaro.”In recent months, “Where is Queiroz?” became a rallying cry for Bolsonaro opponents who were dismayed that the former driver continued to elude authorities.President Bolsonaro in October said Queiroz, a former military police officer, had been his friend since the 1980s, but he hadn’t spoken with him since allegations surfaced.The investigation that yielded his arrest began when the government’s watchdog for financial transactions detected suspicious movements in his bank account, according to authorities. It is suspected the money may form part of a corruption scheme involving appropriation of salaries from phantom employees of Flávio Bolsonaro’s office while he was a lawmaker in Rio state’s legislature.The financial regulator has said that many of the payments to Queiroz came on pay days for people on Flávio Bolsonaro’s payroll. In December, Rio prosecutors carried out searches at 24 properties, including a chocolate shop owned by Bolsonaro.He said on Twitter that the operation is part of an attempt to damage his father’s administration.“I face today’s events with calm. The truth will prevail! Another piece was moved on the board to attack Bolsonaro,” the younger Bolsonaro said. “The game is rough!”A profanity-laced video released May 22 at the order of a Supreme Court justice, showed Bolsonaro at a Cabinet meeting in April expressing frustration with his inability to get information from police and vowing to change ministers if needed to protect his family and friends.The presidential press office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, and as of early afternoon Bolsonaro hadn’t made any comment on social media.Queiroz stopped working with Flávio Bolsonaro in October 2018. Paulo Marinho, a businessman and former ally of President Bolsonaro, told newspaper Folha de S.Paulo last month that Flávio Bolsonaro decided to fire Queiroz upon receiving leaked information that his aide would be targeted by an investigation.“The investigation will advance and could eventually hold Flávio Bolsonaro responsible,” said Michael Mohallem, a law professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university and think tank. “Flávio isn’t just a son; he’s a politician and his father’s advisor. There’s been contamination of the president’s image. Bolsonaro, who already had his image as an anti-corruption leader eroded, will be hit further.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arrest-of-ex-aide-to-brazilian-prez-bolsonaro-s-son-another-hit-for-leader/story-R83jbXdtX9LRe1JEAVxIkM.html
19-06-2020||World||Beijing adds 25 more Covid-19 cases, tally now 183; expert says city outbreak under control||Beijing added 25 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for Thursday, four more than the day before, taking the tally to 183 for the new outbreak in the city with nearly all the infections linked to the sprawling Xinfadi fresh food market in the southwestern Fengtai district.Overall, mainland China reported 32 newly-diagnosed Covid-19 cases, including four imported cases (three in Guangdong and one in Gansu), and 28 local infections comprising 25 in Beijing, two cases in neighbouring Hebei province and one case in the northeastern province of Liaoning.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageTwo new suspected cases, both local, were reported in Beijing, the National Health Commission (NHC) said in its daily bulletin on Friday morning.The caseload in Beijing went up after a Chinese medical expert on Thursday evening said that the city has brought the outbreak under control though the capital could expect sporadic new cases.The first case in this new outbreak was reported on June 11, leading city authorities to reimpose a level two alert days after it had been lowered to the level three, or the least, alert on June 6.Beijing authorities acted quickly to curb infection risks in the capital, shutting down and disinfecting fresh food and wet markets, fencing off dozens of residential communities near the affected markets, restricting travel out of Beijing and carrying out hundreds of thousands of nucleic acid tests.Beijing is under a restricted lockdown with three categories of people not allowed to leave.The first category includes confirmed Covid-19 patients, suspected cases, close contacts, asymptomatic carriers and people with fever. The second covers those who have visited Xinfadi wholesale farm-produce market or had close contact with relevant staff since May 30. The third includes people living in medium- and high-risk areas, a local official has said.Other residents should also avoid unessential travels outside Beijing and a negative nucleic-acid test certificate issued within the past seven days is a must for those who urgently need to leave the city.Late on Thursday, Wu Zunyou, the chief epidemiologist of China’s Centre for Diseases Prevention and Control, said: “The epidemic in Beijing has been brought under control”.Going by recent case numbers, June 13 was the peak of the current outbreak, Wu told a regular news conference a day after new confirmed cases fell to 21, from 31 the previous day.“When I say that it’s under control, that doesn’t mean the number of cases will turn zero tomorrow or the day after,” Wu said.“The trend will persist for a period of time, but the number of cases will decrease, just like the trend that we saw (in Beijing) in January and February,” he said.Gao Fu, the director of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), had earlier said the outbreak probably did not occur in early June or late May, but probably a month earlier.“A lot of asymptomatic or mild cases were detected in this outbreak and that is why the environment has such a large amount of virus,” Gao said at a seminar in Shanghai this week.Overall, China has reported 4,634 deaths and 83,325 infections from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-adds-25-more-covid-19-cases-tally-now-183-expert-says-city-outbreak-under-control/story-ZIMLyOvLLwq4Wps6ziyjyJ.html
19-06-2020||World||Nursing homes represent more than 1 in 4 Covid-19 deaths in US||Nursing home residents account for nearly one in 10 of all the coronavirus cases in the United States and more than a quarter of the deaths, according to an Associated Press analysis of government data released Thursday.As federal data collection becomes more robust, a clearer picture is emerging of the ravages of Covid-19 in nursing homes. About 1.4 million older and medically frail people live in such facilities, a tiny share of the American population that has borne a crushing burden from the pandemic.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageMost residents have been in lockdown since early March, isolated from families and friends, even in death.AP’s analysis of data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found that nearly half of the more than 15,000 nursing homes have reported suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19 as of June 7. About 1 in 5 facilities — or 21% — have reported deaths.Nationwide, nursing homes reported nearly 179,000 suspected or confirmed cases among residents and 29,497 deaths. The latest figures include about 95% of nursing homes.Earlier this week, a special House panel on the coronavirus pandemic launched an investigation into the crisis in nursing homes.The vulnerabilities are many. Residents live in close quarters, usually two to a room before the pandemic. They shared dining and recreational areas, and physical therapy gyms. Many staff aides work in several facilities, so they can unwittingly carry the virus from one nursing home to another.Lawmakers are concerned “that lax oversight by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the federal government’s failure to provide testing supplies and personal protective equipment to nursing homes and long-term care facilities may have contributed to the spread of the coronavirus,” said committee Chairman James Clyburn, D-S.C. “Despite CMS’s broad legal authority, the agency has largely deferred to states, local governments, and for-profit nursing homes to respond to the coronavirus crisis.” But CMS chief Seema Verma has said that “trying to finger-point and blame the federal government is absolutely ridiculous.” She says nursing homes with poor ratings on infection control are more likely to have high numbers of cases, a claim that academic researchers say they have not been able to substantiate.Republican lawmakers also have blamed some Democratic governors who issued orders requiring nursing homes to take recovering coronavirus patients.New York rescinded its directive after Gov. Andrew Cuomo faced an outcry.The AP’s analysis also found that: — Among states, New Jersey had the highest proportion of nursing homes with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 cases, about 82%. This comprises 299 of the state’s 363 nursing homes.Massachusetts had the highest proportion of nursing homes with Covid deaths, nearly 66%. That represented 247 of the state’s 376 nursing homes.In 30 states, nursing homes’ share of Covid-19 deaths was higher than the national average of 26.7%. In some of the hardest-hit, such as Connecticut and Massachusetts, more than one-third of the state’s deaths occurred in nursing homes. The AP has previously reported a higher number of 45,500 deaths, but that count incorporates assisted living facilities, not just nursing homes, and includes staff. The federal data reported Thursday is for nursing homes, since CMS does not regulate assisted living facilities. Consumers will have access to coronavirus information through Medicare’s NursingHomeCompare website. They will be able to look up individual nursing homes to learn the number of cases and deaths among residents and staff. Data are expected to be updated weekly. CMS head Verma says nursing home reporting required by her agency will “constitute the backbone of a nationwide Covid-19 surveillance system” to identify and contain expected rebounds of the virus as communities reopen businesses and schools. The nation’s first major outbreak, reported in late February, was in a Seattle-area nursing home. The nursing home industry says it’s going to need much more help from the federal government to regularly test staff and residents. Facilities have also lacked adequate supplies of protective gear. The federal data release comes as many states have yet to meet a White House goal to test every resident and staff member for Covid-19. That was supposed to have happened before the end of May. Also unmet is a separate federal goal for state inspectors to assess all nursing homes for infection control. There is no deadline, but federal officials are growing impatient. As of a couple of weeks ago, only a few states had inspected all facilities. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, many nursing homes had “persistent” problems with infection control, according to a recent report from the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency for Congress. On a recent call with governors, Vice President Mike Pence said the federal government is going to be “marshaling resources” to speed up nursing home testing. But states and nursing homes have complained about a lack of tests. Thorough, methodical, ongoing testing of residents and staff is considered one of the keys to making nursing homes safer. Federal officials have recommended a one-time test for all residents and staff, as well as weekly retesting of staff. Nursing homes should retest residents weekly until none test positive. Verma says states should use “extreme caution” before reopening nursing homes to visitors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nursing-homes-represent-more-than-1-in-4-covid-19-deaths-in-us/story-TVs198wE4Yf0frvljLTtlM.html

Islamabad had not given any formal response on the request to hold discussions over the issue earlier, according to the diplomatic sources.The Pakistan foreign office had said on June 5 that Pakistan and India are cooperating with each other to tackle the issue of desert locust under a forum administered by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).Pakistan and India are members of FAO’s Commission for Controlling the Desert Locust in South-West Asia (SWAC).Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson Aisha Farooqui, in the weekly media briefing, had said that the ministerial meeting of the commission was held in March during which it was decided to reactivate communication between the member states on the locust situation and a Technical and Operational Coordination (ToC) team was formed to exchange information, enhance coordination at the border areas and increase synchronisation to combat desert locust outbreak in the region, Dawn reported.She said Pakistan had been participating in the SWAC meeting on a weekly basis. She said cooperation in exchanging information in bordering areas of Pakistan and India was “fruitful”, according to the report.“We believe that the respective technical teams have been coordinating appropriately through FAO,” she had said.Farooqui said that Pakistan “remains committed to cooperating with all SWAC member states, including India, in combating desert locust outbreak”.Pakistan and India are facing the worst locust attack in recent years. The desert locust is a species of locust, a swarming short-horned grasshopper and poses an unprecedented threat to food supply and livelihoods of millions of people.Locust swarms from Pakistan entered Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh threatening standing crops.

Authorities said Thursday that Peace Arch Provincial Park in Surrey, British Columbia, had become too crowded, raising concerns about traffic and public safety during the coronavirus pandemic.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe park is adjacent to Peace Arch Historical State Park in Washington state. Visitors from both sides can cross the border without showing passports or other forms of identification, as long as they remain in the park. With the border closed to nonessential travel, the park has been one of the only options for separated friends and families to see each other. Some cross-border couples have even had their weddings there. But British Columbia officials say parking lots and access roads have been overwhelmed with nearly twice as many vehicles as typical peak summer traffic. Efforts to manage the number of visitors by posting signs, increasing patrols and limiting park hours have fallen short, they said. Officials have also noted that Canada recently changed travel restrictions to allow immediate family members of Canadian citizens and permanent residents to enter Canada to be with an immediate family member as long as they are asymptomatic of Covid-19 and self-isolate for 14 days on arrival. Authorities said they would reopen the park when they deem it safe to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-closes-cross-border-park-where-families-reunited/story-zfDWTegCrUvOlXa57pI17M.html
19-06-2020||World||Decline in new US coronavirus deaths may be temporary reprieve||The number of deaths per day from the coronavirus in the US has fallen in recent weeks to the lowest level since late March, even as states increasingly reopen for business. But scientists are deeply afraid the trend may be about to reverse itself.“For now, it’s too soon to be reassured that deaths are going down and everything’s OK,” said Dr. Cyrus Shahpar of Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit organization that works to prevent epidemics.Deaths from Covid-19 across the country are down to about 680 a day, compared with around 960 two weeks ago, according to an Associated Press analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The analysis looked at a seven-day rolling average of deaths through Wednesday.A multitude of reasons are believed to be at play, including the advent of effective treatments and improved efforts at hospitals and nursing homes to prevent infections and save lives.But already there are warning signs.For one thing, the number of newly confirmed cases per day has risen from about 21,400 two weeks ago to 23,200, the AP analysis found.And in Florida, Georgia, Texas and Arizona — states that loosened their stay-at-home restrictions early — daily deaths have been quietly rising since early June, said Ali Mokdad, professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle.“These are not numbers. These are human beings,” Mokdad said. “We’re going to see a rise in deaths in many places in the United States.”The outbreak has killed about 118,000 people in the US and nearly a half-million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins’ count, though the real numbers are believed to be higher. Potential vaccines are in early stages of testing, and it is unlikely any will be ready before early next year.Experts note that a rise in deaths could take awhile to show up in the US statistics. Stay-at-home orders imposed in March, combined with the use of face masks and other social-distancing measures, have been bringing down the daily death toll since mid-April, and the US as a whole is still seeing the positive effects, even though people are starting to work, shop and eat out again.Doctors watching for an uptick in deaths will be on the alert for certain signals to emerge in a specific order, Shahpar said.First, cellphone data will show people moving around more. Next, doctors will report more flu-like illnesses, and the proportion of people testing positive for the virus will rise. Hospitalizations will then go up and, finally, so will deaths.Several factors are believed to be pushing the curves for deaths and cases in opposite directions.Rising case numbers can partially be explained by the wider availability of testing. Mild cases, previously undetected because of limits on who could be tested, are now showing up in the numbers.As for the drop in deaths, “it is probably several things happening at once,” said Dr. Shmuel Shoham, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Lessons learned from the “awful early days” are now benefiting the severely sick and people in nursing homes, Shoham said.It looks that way in Washington state’s King County, where the first nursing home outbreak in the US killed 45 people at the Life Care Center in suburban Seattle. County data shows deaths in similar facilities declining over the past two months. And no single facility in the county has come close to the death toll at Life Care, which was struck unaware.While it is unclear how much specific treatments may have contributed to the decline in deaths, doctors are trying antivirals such as remdesivir, plasma donated from people who have recovered from the virus and steroids such as dexamethasone, which grabbed attention this week with reports confirming it can save the lives of many of the sickest patients.While all viruses mutate, scientists say the coronavirus so far is not changing in a way that has made it less deadly.The decline in deaths this spring might well be tied in part to warmer weather as people spend more time outdoors where circulating air disperses the virus. But that does not bode well for the US come this fall and winter.Mokdad noted that deaths are on the rise in the Southern Hemisphere, where it’s now winter.“This virus is going to have a second wave. It’s going to follow the pattern of pneumonia,” he said. “What we’re seeing in the Southern Hemisphere will be happening here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/decline-in-new-us-coronavirus-deaths-may-be-temporary-reprieve/story-aBHguMhMeryJJzdvZErsIJ.html
19-06-2020||World||US has hit agreed troop-cut target of 8,600 in Afghanistan||The United States has reduced its troop presence in Afghanistan to 8,600, fulfilling its obligation as part of a February deal with the Taliban, the general who oversees American forces in that region said Thursday.Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie gave no indication of when, or at what pace, US forces would be further reduced. He noted that the February deal requires the US to fully withdraw its forces by next May, but he called that an “aspirational” commitment that would depend on certain actions by the Taliban.President Donald Trump has been eager for a full US withdrawal from Afghanistan, asserting that American forces are merely policing a civil conflict and should be brought home. The war began in October 2001.Without directly mentioning the 8,600 figure, McKenzie said, “We’re at that number now,” in accordance with the February agreement. The deal said the US would drop to 8,600 within 135 days, which is mid-July. It represents a reduction from about 12,000 troops at the time of the agreement.“We have met our part of the agreement,” he said, speaking at an Aspen Strategy Group webinar.McKenzie said a full US withdrawal would happen if conditions are right.“Conditions would have to be met that satisfy us that attacks against our homeland are not going to be generated from Afghanistan,” he said. “That’s not the Taliban. That is, of course, al-Qaida and ISIS,” referring to the extremist group that used haven in Afghanistan during the Taliban’s previous rule to plan the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, as well as the Islamic State group’s Afghanistan affiliate.As part of the February deal, the Taliban agreed they would not allow any extremist group to use Afghan territory to plan or carry out attacks on the United States.“The jury is still very much out on that” Taliban commitment, McKenzie said, “and so we will watch the Taliban.” He added, “They have not yet completely made that case. There remains an opportunity for them to do it, but time is now beginning to grow short.”McKenzie spoke cautiously of trends in Iraq, where several thousand US troops are training and advising Iraqi forces and contending with periodic hostility from Iranian-backed militia groups. Although he praised recent efforts by the Iraqi government to deal with Iranian influences in the country, he cited “a beginning of a spike in unprovoked rocket attacks on Iraqi bases that host US forces.”He said he thinks Iran and its proxies in Iraq are conducting these recent attacks “because they have been unable to prevail in the political arena in Iraq.” He spoke after Iraqi authorities reported that four rockets exploded inside Baghdad’s fortified Green Zone near the American Embassy. It was the third such reported attack since the US embarked on strategic talks with Iraq’s new government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-hit-agreed-troop-cut-target-of-8-600-in-afghanistan/story-qhx32OVQ2QjonncKd6RafM.html
19-06-2020||World||UN: Venezuelans, other refugees face huge pandemic hardships||The head of the UN refugee agency expressed concerns Thursday about impact of the coronavirus pandemic from Africa’s Sahel region to Latin America and beyond, warning that millions fled upheaval at home and could face hardship abroad among lockdowns and other restrictive measures to fight the outbreak. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said 164 countries have either partially or totally closed their borders to fight Covid-19. Many people who flee abroad rely on the “informal economy” often involving day work with cash wages — economic activities that are at risk as governments ratchet up coronavirus lockdowns.“Of course, it is good that countries are taking these measures of prudence” against the virus, Grandi told the Associated Press ahead of the release of UNCHR’s “Global Trends” report on Thursday. “Unfortunately, UN-19, which has been able to cause the entire world to grind to a halt, has not been able to stop wars, conflicts, violence, discrimination.” “People are still fleeing their countries to seek refuge, to seek protection. This needs to be considered,” he added. Taking his appeal for government action to the UN Security Council by video conference on Thursday, Grandi said Covid-19 was becoming a “risk multiplier” on top of existing drivers like conflict, climate change, political upheaval and uprisings. “Take, for example, the region that perhaps worries me most at the present time — the region of Sahel in West Africa,” he told the council. ”This region is one of the leading regions in driving the displacement figures upwards, at least for the past couple of years, and it’s the theater of one of the most complex regional crises.” Grandi suggested a UN call for a global cease-fire in conflict areas during the pandemic had gone unheeded, and urged the Security Council to work to resolve conflicts that often spur displacement. “Since that call for a global cease-fire there’s been new internal displacement in 19 countries,” he said. “In the last two months, we have seen the growth of 700,000 internally displaced people globally.” The impact could also be stark for 3.7 million Venezuelans abroad, the world’s second-largest refugee group after the 6.6 million Syrians displaced by their country’s war. The Americas right now have become the world’s epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. “One region about which we’re very worried is, of course, Latin America and South America and in particular where countries host many millions of Venezuelans,” Grandi said in the interview. “They are particularly hit by Covid.” In its “Global Trends” report, which found that the number of asylum-seekers, internally displaced people and refugees shot up by nearly 9 million people last year — the biggest rise in its records. That created a total of 79.5 million people, accounting for 1% of all humanity, seeking safety amid conflict, repression and upheaval. UNHCR chalked up the surge to a new way of counting people displaced from Venezuela and a “worrying” new displacement in the persistent trouble spots of Congo, the Sahel region of Africa, Yemen and Syria, which alone accounted for more than 13 million people on the move. While the total figure of people facing forced displacement rose from 70.8 million at the end of 2018, some 11 million people were “newly displaced” last year, with poorer countries among those most affected. UNHCR says forced displacement has nearly doubled from 41 million people in 2010, and five countries — Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, South Sudan and Myanmar — are the source of nearly two-thirds of people displaced abroad. Grandi also noted about 30% to 40% of the world’s refugee population lives in camps. He said Covid-19 hasn’t affected “in dramatic numbers” camps like those in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh — a country that has taken in nearly a million Rohingya Muslims fleeing from Myanmar — or in Africa. Amid the outbreak, UNHCR has stepped up its “cash transfer” programs that put money directly in the pockets of displaced people. Grandi says 65 countries now benefit from such programs “and we have added 40 countries in just the last few months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-venezuelans-other-refugees-face-huge-pandemic-hardships/story-6rGFSvvvLp3ejNcx7mbs3L.html

19-06-2020||World||Trump-appointed global media chief fires heads of 2 media companies, faces backlash||The new chief of US-funded global media is facing a conservative backlash over his decision to fire the heads of two international broadcasters, adding to concerns about the direction of the agency, which oversees the Voice of America and other outlets.The criticism of Michael Pack, who defended his personnel moves, is unusual because it’s coming from supporters of President Donald Trump who had backed his controversial nomination to run the US Agency for Global Media over staunch Democratic objections.Trump allies, including former adviser Sebastian Gorka, have offered public support for the ousted head of the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, Alberto Fernandez, while others have taken issue with the firing of the head of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Jamie Fly.Pack, a conservative filmmaker and onetime associate of Trump adviser Steve Bannon, sacked both of them late Wednesday in a purge of USAGM’s outlets, which also include Radio Free Asia and the Cuba-focused Radio/TV Marti. Those moves have alarmed Democrats who fear Pack intends to turn the agency into a Trump administration propaganda machine.“Every action I carried out was — and every action I will carry out will be — geared toward rebuilding the USAGM’s reputation, boosting morale, and improving content,” Pack said in a statement released by the new agency’s new public affairs staff.The statement called the moves “significant and long-overdue” and said Pack and his team are “committed to eradicating the known mismanagement and scandals that have plagued the agency for decades.”In addition to the agency chiefs, Pack dismissed veteran broadcast news executive Steve Capus, who had been a senior adviser to the organization and its leadership, according to two congressional aides and an AGM employee, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Capus, who was previously president of NBC News for nearly eight years, did not respond to a query sent to an AGM work email address.And, he ousted the head of the Open Technology Fund, a non-broadcast arm of the AGM that works to provide secure internet access to people around the world. Last week, Fund chief Libby Liu submitted her resignation, effective in mid-July, but she was removed with the others.There was no public explanation of why Pack would dismiss any of the officials, let alone those favored by conservatives beyond the general statement of improving the agency.The firing of Fernandez, in particular, has raised conservative hackles. A former career diplomat fluent in Arabic, Fernandez had been hailed by conservatives for bringing what they saw as balance to the Arabic-language outlets AlHurra television and Radio Sawa.“Ambassador Fernandez was the greatest asset America had in foreign broadcasting,” Gorka wrote on Twitter shortly after the dismissals became public.Michael Doran, a former National Security Council and State Department official during President George W. Bush’s administration, called Fernandez’s ouster “asinine” and said that without him, “Pack will be as effective as a drugged bug in a bottle.”David Reaboi, a noted conservative national security analyst, was even more critical, calling Fernandez’s removal “shameful.” “It was unusual for the pro-American side to get represented, and Alberto always made sure it did,” he told the AP. “It was a model for recapturing territory from the far left and righting the ship.““Michael Pack gets confirmed by the Senate and, rather than take stock and talk to people who know what’s happening, he fired everybody,” Reaboi wrote. “Michael Pack destroyed that because he was too dumb to listen — or too dumb to be able to figure out the difference between friends and enemies.”The dismissal of Fly, a former staffer for Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., also attracted criticism, including from Mark Dubowitz, a well-known advocate of the Trump administration’s hawkish policies on Iran. “Poor decision to fire (Fernandez) and (Fly) whose exemplary leadership of MBN and RFE/RL respectively, made America’s public diplomacy more effective, more persuasive and more consistent with American interests and values,” he wrote.Juan Zarate, a Republican former NSC and Treasury staffer, agreed, calling the two dismissals “incomprehensible.” “I’ve watched both for years work with integrity to promote US interests abroad,” he wrote.In addition to Fernandez and Fly, Pack also removed the head of Radio Free Asia, Bay Fang, and the acting chief of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting on Wednesday. He replaced each outlet’s corporate board of directors with allies and installed himself as chairman of each.One of the people added to the board of Radio Free Asia, Jonathan Alexandre, attracted particular concern from Democrats who noted that he is also director of public policy for the conservative Liberty Counsel, a group that the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated a hate group for opposing gay rights.The director and deputy director of the Voice of America, Amanda Bennett and Sandy Sugawara, resigned from their positions on Monday. Taken together, top House Democrats who oversee AGM funding said Pack’s moves were dangerous.“That Mr. Pack took this drastic measure in his first week on the job is shocking, and we have deep concerns that he takes the helm of a critical agency with the intent to prioritize the Trump administration’s political whims over protecting and promoting independent reporting, which is a pillar of freedom and democracy,” said Eliot Engel, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Nita Lowey, chair of the House Appropriations Committee.The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, denounced the firings as an “egregious breach” of the agency’s mission. Menendez had led an unsuccessful fight to block or at least delay Pack’s confirmation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-appointed-global-media-chief-fires-heads-of-2-media-companies-faces-backlash/story-16WlJ2RsfM12YV3yV8XB1I.html
19-06-2020||World||Bolton book shows Trump eager to help autocrats in US courts||President Donald Trump repeatedly sought to interfere in the US judicial system to curry favor with leaders from Turkey to China, according to a new book by former National Security Advisor John Bolton.At a Group of 20 meeting in 2018, Trump told President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that he thought a key Turkish bank facing a Justice Department indictment “was totally innocent of violating US Iran sanctions” and vowed to “take care of things,” according to Bolton.The book, which the White House has dismissed as “lies” and sought to block from going on sale next week, also describes how willing the president was to try to use a US prosecution and fines against a Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE Corp., as a bargaining chip in trade talks. A copy of Bolton’s book, titled “The Room Where It Happened,” was obtained by Bloomberg News.The details offer new evidence of Trump’s apparent willingness to inject his personal political priorities into US legal cases to win favors or impress leaders at odds with the US The president was impeached by the House last year for trying to withhold congressionally mandated aid to Ukraine to get that country’s government to pursue an investigation in former Vice President Joe Biden’s family.In repeated phone calls and meetings, Bolton says Trump asked aides including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, his acting attorney general and other top aides to get senior Justice Department officials involved in the case against the Turkish bank, known as Halkbank. The financial institution was accused of being engaged in a massive scheme to evade sanctions on Iran.“Trump asked whether we could reach acting US Attorney General Matt Whitaker, which I sidestepped,” Bolton writes about the case, which was being prosecuted by federal officials in New York. “Trump then told Erdogan he would take care of things, explaining that the Southern District prosecutors were not his people.”Bolton describes numerous other meetings and phone calls where Erdogan brought up the Halkbank case. He describes Trump as largely uninterested in the case and instead focused on securing the release of Andrew Brunson, an American pastor held in Turkey at the time.The US later brought a criminal case against Halkbank, shortly after Turkey invaded Syria against the Trump administration’s warnings to stay out of the conflict.In the ZTE case, after the administration announced a seven-year ban on US exports to the company, effectively shutting down its operations worldwide, Trump reversed course and allowed the company to stay in business after paying a relatively modest fine of about $1.2 billion.In a passage that Bolton’s many critics in Washington will see as rich in irony, the former national security adviser says congressional Democrats pursuing impeachment charges against Trump would have had a better chance of finding “high crimes and misdemeanors” if they’d focused on those cases and not just Ukraine.Bolton declined to testify to House investigators last year without a subpoena, a process that could have held up proceedings indefinitely. When the impeachment case was sent to the Senate, the Republican majority prevented him from being called as a witness.Barr’s RoleIn the book, Bolton describes how he grew so concerned about Trump’s apparent willingness to disregard the US legal system that he felt compelled to raise the issue with Attorney General William Barr.”Specifically, however, I also wanted to brief him on Trump’s penchant to, in effect, give personal favors to dictators he liked, such as the criminal cases of Halkbank, ZTE, potentially Huawei, and who knew what else,” Bolton writes. “Barr said he was very worried about the appearances Trump was creating, especially his remarks on Halkbank to Erdogan in Buenos Aires at the G-20 meeting.”The Justice Department declined to comment on the allegations surrounding Halkbank, some details of which Bloomberg News reported last October. Pressed for a response, department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec highlighted a statement from January, after parts of Bolton’s manuscript were first reported by the New York Times, saying that his account of the conversation with Barr “grossly mischaracterizes” what they talked about.“There was no discussion of ‘personal favors’ or ‘undue influence’ on investigations, nor did Attorney General Barr state that the president’s conversations with foreign leaders was improper,” the statement said.Trump has also denied any impropriety in the ZTE case. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Thursday, he said Bolton wasn’t around for the ZTE action.“ZTE was my deal,” Trump told the Journal. “I put the fine on them. And I’ve never seen anything quite like it. I essentially closed them up. That was me.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolton-book-shows-trump-eager-to-help-autocrats-in-us-courts/story-fBp8cZ3sd8OB3AdeunSekL.html
19-06-2020||World||Facebook removes Trump ads with symbols once used by Nazis||Facebook has removed a campaign ad by President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence that featured an upside-down red triangle, a symbol once used by Nazis to designate political prisoners, communists and others in concentration camps.The company said in a statement Thursday that the ads violated “our policy against organized hate.” A Facebook executive who testified at a House Intelligence Committee hearing on Thursday said the company does not permit symbols of hateful ideology “unless they’re put up with context or condemnation.”“In a situation where we don’t see either of those, we don’t allow it on the platform and we remove it. That’s what we saw in this case with this ad, and anywhere that that symbol is used, we would take the same action,” said Nathaniel Gleicher, the company’s head of security policy.The Trump campaign spent more than $10,000 on the ads, which began running on Wednesday and targeted men and women of all ages across the US, though primarily in Texas, California and Florida.In a statement, Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said the inverted red triangle was a symbol used by antifa so it was included in an ad about antifa. He said the symbol is not in the Anti-Defamation League’s database of symbols of hate. The Trump campaign also argued that the symbol is an emoji.“But it is ironic that it took a Trump ad to force the media to implicitly concede that Antifa is a hate group,” he added.Antifa is an umbrella term for leftist militants bound more by belief than organizational structure. Trump has blamed antifa for the violence that erupted during some of the recent protests, but federal law enforcement officials have offered little evidence of this.The ADL disputed that the red triangle was commonly used as an antifa symbol. The organization said the triangle was not in its database because it is a historical symbol and the database includes only those symbols used by modern-day extremists and white supremacists.“Whether aware of the history or meaning, for the Trump campaign to use a symbol — one which is practically identical to that used by the Nazi regime to classify political prisoners in concentration camps — to attack his opponents is offensive and deeply troubling,” ADL chief executive officer Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement.The action comes as Facebook and other technology companies face persistent criticism, particularly from Democrats, about whether they are doing enough to police the spread of disinformation and tweets and posts from Trump perceived as inflammatory.Those questions arose during Thursday’s hearing when a Twitter representative was asked why the company flagged but did not remove tweets from the president, including one that raised the prospect of shooting looters during the recent unrest in American cities. Facebook, too, was asked why it did not remove a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last year that appeared to show her slurring her words.“If we simply take a piece of content like this down, it doesn’t go away,” Gleicher said. “It will exist elsewhere on the internet. People who are looking for it will still find it.”With Thursday’s hearing focused on the spread of disinformation tied to the 2020 election, the companies said they had not yet seen the same sort of concerted foreign influence campaigns like the one four years ago, when a Russian troll farm sowed discord online by playing up divisive social issues.But that suggests the threat has evolved rather than diminished, said the executives, who pointed out that media companies controlled by the state were directly and openly engaging online on American social issues to affect public opinion. China, for instance, has likened allegations of police brutality in the U.S. to the criticism it faced for its aggressive treatment of protesters in Hong Kong last year.Preventing disinformation ahead of the election is a significant challenge in a country facing potentially dramatic changes in how people vote, with expected widespread use of mail-in ballots creating openings to cast doubt on the results and even spread false information.Facebook said Thursday that it is working to help Americans vote by mail, including by notifying users about how to request ballots and whether the date of their state’s election has changed.The Vote By Mail notification connects Facebook users to information about how to request a ballot. It is targeted to voters in states where no excuse is needed to vote by mail or where fears of the coronavirus are accepted as a universal excuse.“Providing that accurate information is one of the best ways to mitigate those kinds of threats,” Gleicher said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-removes-trump-ads-with-symbols-once-used-by-nazis/story-rPrtpbrH8Ah4zzLGFisKWI.html
19-06-2020||World||Trump says ‘complete decoupling’ from China remains an option||President Donald Trump said the US could pursue a “complete decoupling from China” in response to unspecified conditions, his most forceful statement yet on the souring ties with Beijing.In a tweet Thursday, Trump refuted comments a day earlier by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who said a full decoupling of the world’s two biggest economies was not “a reasonable policy option.”The tweet comes a day after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Chinese official Yang Jiechi, amid questions over whether the nations’ trade pact will remain in tact. According to Pompeo, Yang said China is committed to maintaining agriculture purchases that were crucial to Trump’s support of the deal.Meanwhile, Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, has cast new light on the deal by alleging that Trump told Chinese counterparts to help him win re-election by buying more US farm products.Trump has also ramped up his rhetoric against Beijing as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread in the US Trump refers to the illness as the “plague from China,” and has accused the country of withholding important information in the early days of the outbreak.“I think the trade deal is a great deal. But ever since we got hit with the Chinese plague, I feel different toward everything having to do with China. And I’ve always been hardline on China,” he told the Wall Street Journal during an interview on Wednesday.Lighthizer told a congressional hearing on Wednesday that he believes US supply chains should be brought back from China, but that the countries’ economies should remain intertwined.“This issue of decoupling is a complicated one. Do I think supply chains should be brought back? Yes. Do I do think they should be brought back from China? Yes. Do I think they should be brought back from everywhere else? Yes,” Lighthizer said.“Do I think that you can sit down and decouple the United States economy from the Chinese economy? No, I think that was a policy option years ago,” he added. “I don’t think it’s a policy -- a reasonable policy option at this point.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-complete-decoupling-from-china-remains-an-option/story-PdhpxRRcOwSQ8iN5m6QU2H.html

KCR made the remarks during the all party meet called to discuss the Chinese act of aggression in Galwan Valley which resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers on Monday night. “We need to adopt short-term and long-term strategies to counter China. In this regard, we all stand by the Central government,” KCR said, while leaders from other political parties made a range of suggestions including an economic blockade to counter Beijing .KCR laid emphasis on laying a careful strategy and said the need of the hour was not Raj Neeti (politicking) but Ran Neeti (war strategy). He added that China was not able to tolerate India’s growth as a stable democracy and an economic superpower. “In order to overcome its internal crisis, China is trying to create a war-like situation on the borders to divert their people’s attention,” he opined.KCR, however, opposed the suggestion for stopping all imports from China. “It will be a hasty decision. First, let us start indigenously producing the goods that we are importing from China and make them affordable. Then we can think of banning imports,” he advised.Also Read: ‘Taught them a lesson’: PM Modi explains the big picture in stand-off with ChinaHe also used the platform to announce an ex gratia relief of Rs 5 crore to the family of Colonel Santosh Babu, the commander of 16 Bihar regiment, who was killed in a clash with Chinese troops at Galwan valley in eastern Ladakh.

Our actions will instill confidence among the armed forces personnel and their families,” he said.The chief minister said while the Central government will provide necessary support to the families of the martyrs, the states too should take responsibility and join hands to extend support.He emphasised the need for the states to provide monetary and other support to the bereaved families by reducing their expenditures even during the Covid-19 crisis.The chief minister said India should not take any hasty decisions with regard to skirmishes with China on border issues, while, at the same time, not compromising on the national interests. “We need to adopt short-term and long-term strategies to counter China. In this regard, we all stand by the Central government,” he said.Stating that what we need at present is not Rajneeti (politicking) but Ranneeti (war strategy), KCR said China was not able to tolerate India growing as a stable democracy and an economic superpower. “In order to overcome its internal crisis, China is trying to create a war-like situation on the borders to divert their people’s attention,” he opined.KCR, however, opposed the clamour for stopping of all imports from China. “It will be a hasty decision. First, let us start indigenously producing the goods that we are importing from China and make them affordable. Then we can think of banning imports,” he advised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kcr-announces-rs-5-crore-for-col-santosh-s-family-rs-10-lakh-each-for-kin-of-19-soldiers/story-Kdt6sjfgl1cU3AsEJAKu5N.html

Shah added that the meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sent out an unequivocal message that all parties have full faith in the valour of India’s armed forces and their ability to defend India’s sovereignty.“Attended all-party meet chaired by PM Modi. Meeting had an unequivocal message — India is one when it comes to national security. All parties are proud of our armed forces, their valour and have full faith in them to defend our sovereignty & territorial integrity,” Shah said in a tweet.He went on to say that the meeting was also a demonstration of Prime Minister Modi’s commitment to take all political stakeholders along on key matters.“The all-party meeting today was enriched by the views of various esteemed leaders. It was a manifestation of PM Narendra Modi’s commitment to take all political stakeholders along, when it comes to key matters involving India’s strategic interests,” Shah’s follow-up tweet said.Minutes ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had told the meeting that neither anyone entered Indian territory nor were Indian posts taken over during the recent stand-off and following clashes with China along the line of actual control (LAC).The prime minister was briefing leaders of key political parties on the more than six-weeks-long border standoff with China which has recently led to killing of 20 Indian soldiers in the Galwan Valley in a bloody clash which has sent the ties between the two neighbouring countries into a downward spiral.The prime minister also said that the soldiers who perished in the clash taught a lesson to the aggressors for daring to look towards India.He also added that the army has been given the “freedom” to take necessary steps to defend the nation’s territorial integrity.Also Read: ‘Taught them a lesson’: PM Modi explains the big picture in stand-off with ChinaThe prime minister also assured the leaders that the armed forces are leaving no stone unturned to protect the country. The categorical statement by the prime minister came in the wake of reports that Chinese military has transgressed into the Indian side of the LAC, which is treated as the de-facto border, in several areas of eastern Ladakh including Pangong Tso and Galwan Valley.A government statement on the meeting added that New Delhi has also clearly conveyed its position to China through diplomatic means. The Prime Minister, according to the statement, told leaders that India today has such capability that no one can even dare to look towards “an inch of our land”.PM Modi said the entire country is hurt and angry at the Chinese action while underscoring that India wants peace and friendship, but it considered upholding sovereignty to be of “foremost” importance.The nearly four-hour meeting was attended by top opposition leaders including Sonia Gandhi, Sharad Pawar, Mamata Banerjee, Uddhav Thackeray and Sitaram Yechury among others. NDA ally and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, too, attended the meet.Also Read: Parties unite behind Centre, offer tactics, strategies: All top quotes hereWhile Sonia Gandhi asked the government to answer if the incident was a result of intelligence failure that failed to pick up the Chinese build up at the LAC and also sought an assurance from centre that status quo ante would be restored at the border, she also pledged her party’s support to the government in dealing with the emergent issues of national interest.Sharad Pawar, a former defence minister said diplomatic channels should be used to defuse the tension, adding Chinese troops must be “evacuated” from the high ground in the Galwan valley, according to PTI.Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee said her party stands firmly behind the Centre in this hour of crisis and advocated blocking Chinese investments in strategically important infrastructure sectors.Opposition parties like the RJD, AAP and AIMIM reacted angrily over not being invited to the meeting and raised questions over the criteria for the invitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-is-one-amit-shah-spells-out-the-message-from-all-party-meet-on-galwan-valley-clash/story-PJS5hFTeehvYgDTOoAGQ8J.html

19-06-2020||India||How India military stacks up vis-a-vis Chinese defence forces||The stand-off between India and China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh region has created a tense situation at the international border. There have been efforts from both sides to defuse the tension but no breakthrough has been achieved so far. Indications are that the situation might deteriorate further. So, it becomes important to compare the military might of the two countries. On paper, the Chinese military appears to be stronger than India. But in reality, Indian soldiers are better equipped to fight in extreme climates, according to an analysis published in HT’s sister publication Hindustan.It is a well-known fact that China spends more on the defence sector. In 2019, it allocated $261 billion for the defence sector. In comparison, India spent a little over $71 billion. China might have more weapons, but India is ahead in terms of number of soldiers. India has around 34 lakh soldiers whereas China has 27 lakh. The Belfer Centre for Science and International Affairs in Harvard Kennedy School says that India’s Air Force is more powerful than China’s. The Mirage 2000 and Sukhoi 30 that India have give Indian Air Force an edge over China’s J10, J11 and Su-27 fighter jets. India also has all-weather multirole aircraft, whereas only the J10 in China has this capability.India also has more experience in fighting wars then China. It has fought many wars with Pakistan over the years and won all of them. China, on the other hand, fought the last war in Vietnam in 1979. When it comes to high altitude warfare, India is better prepared than China here too. There are many aircraft in India which are capable of flying at high altitudes, whereas Chinese pilots have to fly with limited supplies and fuel due to difficult weather conditions in their airbases near Tibet.Both India and China are nuclear powered countries. What makes this comparison interesting is that India keeps on participating in war exercises with other big countries like the US, France, the UK etc. The Americans can help Indians with intelligence inputs in case the situation deteriorates further. China, on the other hand, has been fighting many countries on too many fronts, the latest being on the spread of the coronavirus disease.(Analysis done by Defence and strategy expert Major (Retd) Mohd Ali Shah for Hindustan Times’ sister publication Live Hindustan)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-india-military-stacks-up-vis-a-vis-chinese-defence-forces/story-OHXDNM1X3al4DBSohTgZRI.html
19-06-2020||India||A depleted Telangana Congress may see another MLA move to TRS||An already thinned out Congress in Telangana - after 12 of its MLAs broke away from the party and merged with the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) in 2019 - may suffer further blow as its Bhadrachalam MLA Podem Veeraiah allegedly upset over infighting in the party may join ranks with the TRS. The Congress had won 19 out of 119 assembly seats in the state in December 2018 elections, but was reduced to just six seats after a big chunk of its MLA moved over to KCR’s party. While Congress’ Veeraiah could not be reached for comment, a senior Congress leader familiar with the development said the tribal MLA has become inaccessible to the state party leaders for the last few days.“We are aware that the TRS leadership has been trying to lure Veeraiah into the party because he holds considerable influence in the tribal areas of Khammam district. So, there is no surprise if he has any plans to move into the TRS,” the Congress leader said.If Veeraiah jumps changes track and joins the TRS, the Congress would be left with just five MLAs: Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka, D Anasuya alias Seethakka, D Sridhar Babu, T Jayaprakash Reddy and K Rajagopal Reddy. Out of those, Rajagopal Reddy is also looking towards the Bharatiya Janata Party and made statements in support of Prime Minister Narendra Modi many times.On Thursday, some senior Telangana Congress leaders, who met at the residence of a former Rajya Sabha member, expressed concern over the lack of unity among the party leaders, mainly due to the alleged unilateral decisions taken by PCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy.The ex-MP asked AICC general secretary in-charge of Telangana affairs R C Khuntia to immediately call for a meeting of the core committee to thrash out all the differences within the party and activate the party cadre.“It is because of the attitude of the PCC leadership that some leaders are leaving the party. It is time the core committee calls for an emergency meeting and sort things out, before they go further out of hand,” he said.The last time the core committee of the PCC, headed by Khuntia, had met was in November 2019 after the defeat of PCC chief’s wife N Padmavathi Reddy in the by-elections to Huzurnagar with a huge margin of over 43,000 votes. Following his wife’s defeat Uttam Kumar Reddy offered to step down as PCC chief.Around the same time, the party high command sent a team of observers comprising AICC general secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad and former Karnataka minister H K Patil to collect the opinions of all the party leaders on choosing a suitable candidate for the PCC chief post.The team held a series of meetings with party leaders who called for a dynamic team at the PCC and a complete overhaul of the party. “But there was no consensus on the candidate for PCC chief and after that, there was no information whatsoever from Delhi. The party continues to be in a state of limbo,” the Congress leader quoted above said.The attempts of PCC working president and Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy to project himself as a potential candidate for the PCC chief post were thwarted by seniors like former MP V Hanumantha Rao, former deputy chief minister Damodar Rajanarasimha, Bhongir MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy and Sangareddy MLA T Jayaprakash Reddy.Jayaprakash Reddy went to the extent of threatening that he would have to choose his own path if Revanth Reddy is made the PCC chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-depleted-telangana-congress-may-see-another-mla-move-to-trs/story-IoVjyqrLkgANRG0TXlm8dL.html

Two seats in the assembly are vacant as chief minister Hemant Soren vacated Dumka seat while retaining Barhait after the assembly polls in December. The Bermo assembly seat fell vacant after senior Congress MLA Rajendra Prasad Singh died last month.The candidates had to secure 27 first preference votes for victory. Shibu Soren, who lost from Dumka Lok Sabha constituency in 2019 elections, will be entering the upper house of Parliament for the second time after romping home with 30 votes. The BJP state president Prakash got 31 votes, while Congress’ Anwar could secure only 18 votes.Also Read: BJP and Congress win three RS seats in MP and Rajasthan, Jagan wins all 4 in AndhraWhile the JMM has 29 legislators in the current assembly, the BJP has 26 members including former chief minister Babulal Marandi, who merged his party with the saffron party after the assembly polls. The Congress currently has 15 representatives in the legislature.BJP’s former ally AJSU had pledged support of its two legislators to the BJP candidate, besides two BJP-rebels who won as independents in the assembly poll, including former minister Saryu Roy who had emerged giant killer in the assembly election by defeating former colleague and the sitting chief minister Raghubar Das.“I thank party’s national leadership and party legsilators. I also thank AJSU party, Saryu Roy and Amit Yadav (independent legislators) for their support. We always maintained we have the numbers and we have emerged victorious with maximum votes. Ideally this election should not have happened and even JMM president should have got elected uncontested. But the Congress fielded its candidate and forced an unwanted election,” Prakash told reporters. Chief minister Hemant Soren said while the JMM and NDA won one seat each, his party would continue its political fight against the BJP. “UPA had fielded second candidate thinking that many legislators and parties who had contested against the BJP in assembly election would support us, but it seems the BJP contested the Rajya Sabha election here, as it has been doing in other states, to win over MLAs to its side. We will continue our political fight against the BJP,” Soren told reporters. Jharkhand Congress working president and legislator Irfan Ansari said he wondered why those against the BJP did not support the UPA candidate. “I fail to understand why people like Saryu Roy did not support us. They are senior leaders of the state. Wonder what the youngsters would learn from them,” he added. With today’s win, the BJP now has four representatives from Jharkhand in the upper house of Parliament out of the total six RS seats in the state. The ruling JMM and Congress in the state have one member each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jmm-s-shibu-soren-and-bjp-s-deepak-prakash-win-rajya-sabha-polls-from-jharkhand/story-xo7gOyuaX35Xlc1teKLNgK.html

The deputy chief minister has recently taken additional charge of Delhi’s health ministry after health minister Satyendar Jain tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government began Covid-19 tests through the rapid antigen procedure in and around containment zones of the national capital on Thursday. A total of 341 teams were involved in the rapid-antigen testing that gives results within 30 minutes. In a tweet yesterday, Sisodia said, “7,040 people underwent rapid-antigen tests at 193 centres across Delhi. Of this, 456 people have been found positive.” He indicated that those residing in containment zones are being tested in the initial phase and the process would be gradually expanded to other areas in Delhi.

Those “In Ladakh, our 20 jawans got martyred. But they taught a lesson to those who were eyeing Indian territory,” he said.Twenty Indian soldiers lost their lives in this deadly face-off. But information available with South Block indicates that the soldiers were able to cause heavy losses on their adversaries. According to this information, the Chinese side ended up with about 35 casualties - soldiers who died or were seriously injured. The dead include the People’s Liberation Army’s commanding officer and his second-in-charge.Also read | Ladakh isn’t South China Sea, will not allow status quo to change: OfficialPM Modi kept his thrust sharply on India’s improved military capability, telling political parties - friends and rivals alike - that the armed forces were doing all that they could. Right from deployment, taking action or counter-action.“We have the capability that no one can cast an eye on an inch of our territory,” the prime minister said, echoing his commitment to the country this week that India wanted peace but had the capacity and the will to strike back if provoked.India’s armed forces were capable of simultaneously moving into different theatres, he said, a reference to the oft-repeated concern around the military’s capability of fighting a two-front war on its western and northern borders. There has been a lingering concern within India’s strategic community that Pakistan was likely to try to exploit the situation in case a conflict between India and China blows up.Back in 2017 when he was the army chief and led the army into the Doklam crisis, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat had underlined that China was gradually trying to take over territory and testing India’s threshold and India needed to be prepared for a two-front war.At the all party meeting on Friday, PM Modi also stressed the vast improvement in border infrastructure and military capacities that had taken place over the last few years. “We have also addressed other requirements of the forces such as fighter planes, modern helicopters, missile defence systems,” he said.These factors had raised India’s capacity of patrolling along the Line of Actual Control. “Because of the improved patrolling, our vigilance has gone up and the military gets to know what is happening on the borders at the right time,” he said, pointing that our soldiers were able to intercept the Chinese forces who earlier had a free run. “If you keep on intercepting them, it is obvious that tensions will rise,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-one-can-take-an-inch-pm-modi-spotlights-india-s-military-capabilities/story-sq7sFZaVObfrkaoxeSXBrN.html
19-06-2020||India||Puri Shankaracharya, priests want SC to review stay on Rath Yatra||Upset over cancellation of Rath Yatra by the Supreme Court in view of Covid-19 pandemic, several priests of the Jagannath temple, including Puri seer Shankaracharya Swami Nischalananda Saraswati, on Friday insisted that the top court reconsider its decision on the festival.“The cancellation of Rath Yatra is not correct. The SC can allow the deities to get on the chariots. However, the congregation of the devotees should be banned and the festival be organised with limited servitors and police. The festival can be telecast live,” said Saraswati, a day after the apex court stayed the annual car festival at Puri.On Thursday, a three-judge bench, headed by chief justice SA Bobde, said as 10-12 lakh people may congregate in Puri for the Rath Yatra scheduled to be held on June 23, it would be appropriate in the interests of public health and safety of citizens to restrain the government from holding the Rath Yatra.This is the first time that the Rath Yatra would not be held in the last 285 years. The last time the car festival could not be held was between 1733 and 1735 when Mohammed Taqi Khan, deputy governor of Odisha, attacked the Jagannath temple, forcing the shifting of the idols to Ganjam district.Chattisa Nijog, the apex body of priests of the Shree Jagannath Temple, too urged the state government to approach the Supreme Court. “It seems that the Supreme Court was not properly apprised of the preparations made by temple administration and the Odisha government for the June 23 Rath Yatra. The Centre had allowed chariot construction for the festival, and accordingly all arrangements were made, with carpenters and servitors made to undergo health screening from time to time. With just four days to go before the festival, the state government should immediately move the apex court seeking a modification of its order,” said Janardhan Pattajoshi Mohapatra, the chief priest of Chattisa Nijog, in a letter to chief minister Naveen Patnaik.In Puri, two organisations — Srijagannath Sena and Srikshetra Suraksha Bahini – today called for a dawn-to-dusk shutdown in protest against the cancellation of the Rath Yatra. Members of the two outfits also staged protests in the town, claiming that the state government did nothing to facilitate the annual car festival.While the opposition BJP and Congress said everybody have to abide by the Supreme Court order on Rath Yatra, senior BJP leader Bijay Mohapatra said the state government’’s role will remain under “suspicion” after the sudden cancellation of the biggest festival of Lord Jagannath.“It is a fact that there is fear of the pandemic and all the people without any condition support the state government’s steps to fight against the virus. All rituals of the deities, including Snana Yatra (Bathing ritual), on June 5 were completed with strict adherence to the guidelines. The servitors also provided full cooperation and offered to undergo Covid-19 test during the construction of the chariots,” Mohapatra said.Congress MLA Suresh Kumar Routray said the state government is responsible for the stay on the Rath Yatra.“I cannot tolerate such development. You (state government) have broken the century old tradition... What have you done? Lord Jagannath will never forgive you (state government),” said Routray in a choked voice.However, senior BJD leader and government chief whip Pramila Mallick said there is no conspiracy. “Who will give the guarantee that the disease will not further spread when lakhs of people congregate during the annual festival,” she said.Meanwhile, two petitions have been filed in SC seeking review of the order. One Laxmidhar Biswal of Puri district moved the Supreme Court on the ground that the apex court had not consulted the Shankaracharya before announcing the order.Biswal proposed to the chief minister that the Odisha government should promulgate an ordinance to celebrate the Rath Yatra like the one done by Tamil Nadu government on Jallikattu.The first intervention application filed by the Jagannath Sanskruti Jana Jagarana Mancha seeking a recall of the Supreme Court order said that the Odisha Vikas Parishad did not cite the Orissa High Court order of June 9 in which the HC had not stayed the rath yatra, instead leaving it to the state government to decide “whether or not to hold the rath yatra on June 23.”It said the Snana Purnima ritual was performed on June 5 with the help of 800 servitors and all of them had tested negative in Covid-19 tests. The 800 servitors are in isolation for more than one month as of today, the petitioners said. As per the High Court order, 372 labourers were allowed to be engaged in the construction of the 3 raths for more than one and a half months. All of these labourers are in isolation and were found to be Covid-19 negative.It also said thousands of people in Puri municipality had gathered on the road connecting Puri Jagannath temple to Gundicha temple on May 30 by maintaining social distance for singing the state anthem.The Manch said the June 18 order be modified so that the Rath Yatra can be performed by 500-600 servitors by maintaining a social distance on the three-km road stretch.Another intervention application seeking a partial modification of the SC order was filed by Aftab Hossen, a resident of Puri, which argued that crores of rupees have been spent in construction of the chariots and Covid-19 tests of hundreds of servitors. The intervenor said after the June 18 order, people of Odisha are feeling hurt and that the Court should allow the conduct of the yatra with participation only from servitors and temple police, without the general public playing a role in it.Hossen further petitioned that it is important to celebrate the festival as there is “scientific evidence” that the weather becomes pleasant when Lord Jagannath is brought out of the temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puri-shankaracharya-priests-want-sc-to-review-stay-on-rath-yatra/story-MI4hkcCuPgipIYRHvYq1kM.html

Mamata Banerjee (TMC)-- Don’t let China enter the telecom, railway and aviation sectors. We will face some problems but we won’t allow the Chinese to enter. China is not a democracy. They are a dictatorship. They can do what they feel. We, on the other hand, have to work together. India will win, China will lose. Speak with unity. Think with unity. Work with unity. We are solidly with the Govt. All-party meeting is a good message for the nation. Shows that we are united behind our Jawans- – As reported by ANIRam Gopal Yadav (SP) -- Nation is one. ‘Neeyat’ of Pakistan and China is not good. India will not be China’s dumping ground. Impose 300% duty on Chinese goods. – As reported by ANIUddhav Thackeray (SS)-- India wants peace but that doesn’t mean we are weak. China’s nature is betrayal. India is ‘Mazboot’ not ‘Majboor’. Our government has the ability to - ‘Aankhien Nikalkar Haath Me de dena’. We are all one. This is the feeling. We are with you, PM. We are with our forces and their families. – As reported by ANIPinaki Misra (BJD)--China has repeated history, once again in the cover of darkness in a cowardly move, they attacked our soldiers who went with a message of peace. ‘Sarkar ko jawab dena padega’, strong action will have to be initiated (against China). Whatever that action may be, the BJD will fully support the Government. Shri Naveen Patnaik ji’s appeal to all parties is not to indulge in a blame game at this point. We must be in lockstep with the Government, the entire country needs to talk in one voice. – As reported by ANINitish Kumar (JDU)-- There is nationwide anger against China. There should be no differences among us. We are together. Parties should not show any disunity that can be explored by other nations. China’s stand on India is known. India wanted to give respect to China. But what did China do in 1962. Goods from China flooding Indian markets have major problems. They’re plastic heavy, aren’t eco-friendly & they harm the environment. Electronic waste associated with them is high. Chinese products don’t even last long. It’s our duty to be one and support the Centre. – As reported by ANISharad Pawar (NCP)--During my tenure as the Defence Minister of India, I had visited China and signed a Peace and Tranquillity Agreement with China. The agreement of 1993 was the first peace effort after 1962 Indo-China War. Both the countries have continued to respect the terms of Understanding, barring some incidents on a minor scale as compared to this incident. I shared my views with Hon’ble PM on the basis of my past experience in dealing with border issues and with the information available.Sitaram Yechuri CPI(M)- CPM expresses its deep condolences at the death of our army officers and soldiers in the recent clash that took place along the Indo-China LAC, at the Galwan valley in Ladakh.In the talks between our Minister for External Affairs and the Foreign Minister of China, our official statement states: “At the conclusion of the discussion, it was agreed that the overall situation would be handled in a responsible manner, and both sides would sincerely implement the disengagement understanding of 6 June sincerely. Neither side would take any action to escalate matters and instead, ensure peace and tranquility as per bilateral agreements and protocols.” As the Government of India has adopted this stand, the CPI(M) extends its support to this approach. Following this, the Government of India should initiate high level talks, so that steps are taken, including clear demarcation of the LAC, to maintain peace and tranquillity on the border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parties-unite-behind-centre-offer-tactics-strategies-all-top-quotes-here/story-106FI31Fonqm5DGp6V2XyJ.html
19-06-2020||India||‘China did not enter our territory, no posts taken’: PM at all-party meet on Ladakh clash||The Chinese neither entered our territory nor has any post been taken over by them, underscored Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the all-party meet to discuss the border incident along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh where 20 Indian soldiers died in the line of duty in brutal hand-to-hand combat with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). “Neither have they intruded into our border, nor has any post been taken over by them (China). Twenty of our jawans were martyred, but those who dared Bharat Mata, they were taught a lesson,” said PM Modi.Underlining India’s might, the PM said no one can take even an “inch of the land”.“Today, we possess the capability that no one can eye even one inch of our land. India’s armed forces have the capability to move into multiple sectors at one go,” said the PM.Congress’ Sonia Gandhi, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, Telangana Rashtra Samithi leader K Chandrasekhar Rao, Janata Dal (United) chief Nitish Kumar, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader MK Stalin, YSR Congress Party’s YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray were among those who attended the meeting.Assuring the opposition parties, the PM said be it deployment, action or counter-action our forces - be it on land in air or water - are doing everything to protect our borders.The infrastructure development in border areas has gained in pace over the past years, said the PM, adding that it has strengthened our patrolling capacity. The immediate cause for the conflict at Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh isn’t known, although it could have been about Chinese soldiers dragging their feet about removing some of the installations they erected in May in an area India claims as its own. The troops have since disengaged, the Indian Army said in a statement confirming the number of dead at 20. Indian Army officials claimed 43 Chinese were killed or seriously injured, citing radio intercepts and other intelligence. HT couldn’t independently verify this.These were the first Indian casualties in a border skirmish with the PLA Army since October 1975 when Chinese troops ambushed an Indian patrol in Arunachal Pradesh’s Tulung La sector and shot four soldiers dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-troops-did-not-enter-our-territory-says-pm-modi-at-all-party-meeting-on-ladakh-standoff/story-QGgGUyL3sVRYB7mp3Y8bBI.html
19-06-2020||India||Defence minister Rajnath Singh expected to attend Russia’s Victory Day parade||Defence minister Rajnath Singh is expected to visit Russia next week to participate in the Victory Day parade in Moscow on June 24, people familiar with developments said on Friday.The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the visit is on “as of now” and that Singh will be accompanied by senior Indian officials. He is expected to travel a day or so before the parade, they added.“There is a proposal from the Russian side and we are considering it. The visit is on as of now,” said one of the people cited above, declining to give details.The people said the visit will be closely linked to developments on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), where Indian and Chinese troops have been engaged in a tense standoff since early May. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in a violent face-off with Chinese troops in Galwan Valley on June 15, exacerbating tensions.A high-level Chinese delegation will be present for the Victory Day parade though no meetings are expected with the Indian team, the people said.It was originally expected that defence secretary Ajay Kumar would accompany Singh to Russia, but the defence minister is now expected to travel with senior defence and military officials as Kumar is recovering from Covid-19. Officials had confirmed on June 3 that Kumar had tested positive for Covid-19.India on Thursday confirmed that external affairs minister S Jaishankar will join a virtual meeting of the Russia-India-China (RIC) grouping on June 23, a day ahead of Indian and Chinese military contingents marching in the Victory Day parade.Russia formally announced the virtual meeting of the RIC foreign ministers on Wednesday, quashing doubts about India’s participation in the aftermath of the violent clash along the LAC.A day after the RIC meeting, military contingents from India and China will participate in the Victory Day parade in Moscow, which marks the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany on May 9. Each year, Russia organises a massive military display involving thousands of troops and tanks parading through the Red Square. This year’s event has been delayed by the pandemic.A 75-member Indian tri-service contingent left for Russia on Friday. China sent a 105-member contingent of the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) honour guard on June 15.Moscow’s relations with New Delhi and Beijing are currently very good, and Russian diplomats, in recent remarks to the Indian media, have spoken of the need for easing tensions between India and China for regional stability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-minister-rajnath-singh-expected-to-attend-russia-s-victory-day-parade/story-3jr0FHDEwJJfjQhNpr7TEM.html
19-06-2020||India||YSRC bags all 4 Rajya Sabha seats from Andhra; TDP nominee loses 6 party votes||The ruling YSR Congress Party in Andhra Pradesh won all the four Rajya Sabha seats from the state, elections for which were held on Friday.The four YSRC candidates – Alla Ayodhya Rami Reddy, Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose, Mopidevi Venkata Ramana and Parimal Nathwani were declared elected as they polled the number of votes required for their election.Ayodhya Rami Reddy and Parimal Nathwani are industrialists – the former heading the Ramky Group of Industries while the latter is senior group vice-president of Reliance Industries.The remaining two were, hitherto, members of the legislative council and are part of the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy cabinet. While Subhash Chandra Bose is a deputy chief minister holding the revenue portfolio, Venkata Ramana is the state excise minister.All the four YSRC candidates would have been elected unanimously because the party has enough strength in the assembly – 151 out of 175 MLAs, but the election was necessitated with the Telugu Desam Party fielding its candidate – Varla Ramaiah despite the fact that it has only 23 MLAs in the assembly technically, including three rebels, and requires another 17 votes to win the seat.TDP president and leader of the opposition N Chandrababu Naidu said the party knew it won’t win the Rajya Sabha seat, but had chosen to contest only in the spirit of democracy.At the same time, the TDP was also hoping to expose three rebel MLAs –Vallabhaneni Vamsi from Gannavaram, Karanam Balarama Krishna Murthy from Chirala and Maddali Giridhar from Guntur (West) constituencies, if they voted for the YSRC. The party issued a whip to all the MLAs.However, the TDP candidate ended up getting only 17 votes, as four votes of the party were declared invalid. The three rebel MLAs ensured that their votes become invalid so that they could avoid being disqualified.Another TDP MLA Adireddy Bhavani from Rajahmundry also messed up in marking her first preferential vote in favour of party candidate Varla Ramaiah, as a result of which her vote also was declared invalid.Two other TDP legislators also could not cast their votes. While Tekkali MLA K Atchen Naidu could not exercise his franchise as he is in judicial custody in connection with the Employees State Insurance Scam, another MLA Anagani Satyaprasad from Repalle excused himself stating that he was in self-quarantine at home as he had come in contact with Telangana MLA M Yadagiri Reddy who had tested Covid-19 positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ysrc-bags-all-4-rajya-sabha-seats-from-andhra-tdp-nominee-loses-6-party-votes/story-o6m3A06wKNQRCTV4j4RbVN.html
19-06-2020||India||Rajya Sabha polls: When tribal leader Chottu Bhai Vasava refused to vote||Gujarat MLA Chottu Bhai Vasava on Friday declined to vote in the Rajya Sabha elections, making it easier for the BJP candidates to win their seats. Vasava’s two Bharatiya Tribal Party MLA were expected to vote for the Congress. The decision of not voting, Vasava told HT, was a mark of protest against the BJP government’s “inability” to protect the rights of the tribal communities in the state. The leader added that he was equally disillusioned by the Congress.The BJP had fielded Abhay Bharadwaj, Ramila Bara and Narhari Amin, while the Congress put up Shaktisinh Gohil and Bharatsinh Solanki in the polls. Vasava denied allegations that his decision to not vote was a covert attempt to help the BJP, which had fielded four candidates for the three vacant seats in the state.“I have been asking the BJP government to accept our demand for making tribal areas autonomous by bringing them under Schedule 6 of the Constitution from Schedule 5. There has been no effort to accept the demands of tribal communities, instead tribal people are being divested of their land and forest produce. Even though there is a separate budgetary allocation for the tribal communities governments end up spending this money on other sectors. To protest against these irregularities, I decided not to vote,” said Vasava.This is not the first time that the tribal leader has made news during the Rajya Sabha elections. In August 2017, Vasava - then with the JDU - going against his party whip voted for Congress candidate Ahmed Patel in the Rajya Sabha elections. His vote played a key role in Patel winning the elections. Vasava justifies his decision by announcing that he had done so to protest against JDU president Nitish Kumar’s decision to align with the BJP in Bihar.Patel, along with Amit Shah and Smriti Irani at the time, was re-elected to the Upper House. The election result, announced post midnight, was marked by political wrangling as the Congress demanded that the Election Commission invalidate the votes of two MLAs who had voted for the BJP. A decision that the EC eventually announced after reviewing the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-polls-when-tribal-leader-chottu-bhai-vasava-refused-to-vote/story-ar0yn31B2JoHq9sNcmM7hI.html
19-06-2020||India||All eyes on Manipur RS seat amid tussle for power and drama during voting||There was high drama for the election to the lone Rajya Sabha (RS) in Manipur on Friday amid an ongoing tussle between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress over power-sharing in the politically-volatile north-eastern state.Manipur assembly Speaker Yumnam Khemchand Singh played a key role, as 52 of the 59 members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) were allowed to cast their votes for the two main candidates, the BJP’s Sanajaoba Leishemba, the titular king of Manipur, and the Congress’s T Mangibabu. Earlier this year, the 60-member assembly was reduced to 59 after BJP MLA, Thounaojam Shyamkumar Singh, who had defected to the Congress in 2017, resigned after the Supreme Court (SC) banned him on anti-defection charges.Though polling in the north-eastern state ended at 4pm, the counting of votes had not started even after 7 pm. The delay is being attributed to the Congress’s complaints about the irregularities during the voting process and the Election Commission of India (ECI) is believed to be looking into them.Friday’s voting took place a day after the Congress staked claim to form the state government and two days after nine MLAs including three from the BJP, four from the National People’s Party (NPP), one from the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and an Independent withdrew support to the government, challenging the majority of the N Biren Singh-led coalition government.Earlier in the day, Speaker Singh allowed four of the seven rebel Congress MLAs, who had switched sides to the BJP after the 2017 polls, to vote, but barred the three others.On June 9, the Manipur high court (HC) had restrained the seven Congress MLAs from entering the assembly till the Speaker disposed of disqualification proceedings against them.On Thursday, the HC had asked Speaker not to decide on their cases till June 22.Though the decision on the disqualification of the seven MLAs was to be taken on June 22, the Speaker advanced it to June 17, prompting the Congress to seek his removal the following day.The names of the three BJP MLAs, who had resigned from the party earlier this week and joined the Congress, were not in the list of voters on Friday.The TMC legislator, who had withdrawn support to the BJP, was also not allowed to vote, and he has moved the HC.The Congress demanded that the ECI rejects votes of two MLAs, including that of the Speaker, for allegedly showing their ballot papers to agents present during the polls. The Congress also alleged that one of its party lawmakers had shown his vote to a BJP representative, which violates the Upper House poll norms.Meanwhile, several leaders of the Secular Progressive Front (SPF) led by Congress, NPP, TMC and the lone Independent MLA met Governor Najma Heptullah at the Raj Bhawan on Friday evening seeking a special assembly session soon for a trust vote to take place. “Today Congress has 24 MLAs while the BJP has only 18. Therefore to uphold democracy a trust vote is needed soon,” Manipur Congress spokesperson Ningombam Bupenda Meitei said. The delegation comprised former chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh, former Manipur Congress president Gaikhangam and NPP leader Y Joykumar Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-eyes-on-manipur-rs-seat-amid-tussle-for-power-and-drama-during-voting/story-6VVAHQ6D4iRTfWdx92cWUN.html
19-06-2020||India||Was there intel failure? Sonia Gandhi asks PM on border stand-off with China||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday sought an assurance from the government that status quo will be restored on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) at Galwan Valley in Ladakh area and that China will revert to its original position.In her address at the all-party meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the border stand-off with China, Gandhi asked pointed questions on whether there was an intelligence failure on the massive build-up of Chinese forces along the LAC.“In fact, even at this late stage, we are still in the dark about many crucial aspects of the crisis,” Gandhi said.The meeting was attended by leaders of 20 political parties. Defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar too were present.The Congress has been asking the government to be transparent about the situation along the LAC, especially after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in violent face-off with Chinese troops on Monday night.Modi has said the sacrifice of Indian soldiers will not go in vain and the country will give a befitting reply to any provocation.At the meeting Gandhi said: “We have some specific questions for the government. On which date did the Chinese troops intrude into our territory in Ladakh? When did the government find out about the Chinese transgressions into our territory? Was it on May 5, as reported, or earlier?“Does the government not receive, on a regular basis, satellite pictures of the borders of our country? Did our external intelligence agencies not report any unusual activity along the LAC? Did the Military Intelligence not alert the government about the intrusion and the build-up of massive forces along the LAC, whether on the Chinese side or on the Indian side? In the government’s considered view, was there a failure of intelligence?”She contended that valuable time was lost between May 5 and June 6, the date on which senior Indian and Chinese commanders met and agreed on some de-escalation and disengagement measures. She added that even after the June 6 meeting, efforts should have been made to talk directly, at the political and diplomatic levels, to China’s leadership.“We failed to use all avenues, and the result is the loss of 20 lives as well as dozens injured. I would urge the prime minister to kindly share with us all the facts and the sequence of events beginning April this year till date,” the Congress chief said.“The question is, what next? What is the way forward? The entire country would like an assurance that status quo ante would be restored and China will revert back to the original position on LAC,” she said.Gandhi also sought to know the status of the Mountain Strike Corps, with two mountain infantry divisions, that was sanctioned for the army in 2013, when the Congress was in power at the Centre.“Should the government not treat it with utmost priority? We would also like to be briefed on the preparedness of our defence forces to meet any threat,” she said.Gandhi said the all-party meeting should have been held sooner and immediately after the government had been reportedly informed about the Chinese intrusion on May 5 at several places in Ladakh and elsewhere.“As always, the entire nation would have stood together like a rock and fully supported the government of the day in the steps required to defend the territorial integrity of the country. Alas, that was not to be,” she added. Gandhi said the Congress and the entire opposition unitedly stood by the defence forces and are prepared to make any sacrifice to ensure they are battle-ready.“The entire nation expects that government will take all opposition parties and the country into confidence and brief us regularly so that we may present to the world a picture of unity and solidarity,” she said. Gandhi began her speech by paying homage to the 20 soldiers killed in a violent clash with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in Galwan Valley on Monday night.“We meet today in the aftermath of a tragic conflict and our hearts are filled with great sorrow and anguish. Let me begin by paying homage to the brave soldiers of our army, who laid down their lives as also convey my deepest condolences to the bereaved families. To the injured jawans, we wish them a speedy recovery and good health,” she said.Apart from Gandhi, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, Telangana Rashtra Samithi leader K Chandrasekhar Rao, Janata Dal (United) chief Nitish Kumar, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader MK Stalin, YSR Congress Party’s YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray were among those who attended the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-there-intelligence-failure-sonia-asks-pm-on-border-standoff-with-china/story-sOJseblYToRZ9a71HMJlVN.html
19-06-2020||India||Goa: 90% of state’s 705 Covid-19 positive cases have been recorded in June||Goa, which has a relatively smaller population of 16.6 lakh, has reported 705 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive cases, which are comparable with states such as Himachal Pradesh (HP) that has a far higher population. Goa has been reporting 35 Covid-19 positive cases on an average daily since early June. Worse, the daily average has been 41 Covid-19 positive cases in the past week. On the contrary, HP, whose population is four times that of Goa, has reported 595 Covid-19 positive cases and a daily average of 14.72. While 90% of Goa’s 705 Covid-19 positive cases have been recorded in June, and the daily spike is comparable with much larger states such as Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, which have been reporting 60 and 49 cases, respectively.Goa’s Covid-19 positive graph started rising June 2 onwards, when the coastal state recorded its first local case, when a resident with no recent travel or contact history was found to have contracted SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, and was rushed to a hospital after he complained of severe difficulty in breathing.Now, the state has two containment zones, two micro-containment zones and over 30 isolated cases that could spark outbreaks in their respective neighbourhoods.However, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant sought to explain away the higher number of Covid-19 positive cases and attributed them to aggressive testing.“We’re conducting aggressive testing along the state’s borders and containment zones. That’s why more Covid-19 positive cases are being reported daily,” the CM said.He also pointed out that Goa’s early detection of the viral infection is helping timely treatment for the patients.“Most Covid-19 positive cases are asymptomatic, except 8-10. The symptomatic patients are undergoing treatment at dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and care centres,” he added.Goa has conducted over 46,500 tests, which work out to around 30,000 per million people, which is being touted as among the highest in the country.So far, the state has not recorded any Covid-19 related death, and the lone critical patient has also been taken off the ventilator support. Though Goa has more Covid-19 positive cases as compared to HP (595), no death has been recorded in the state so far. While in HP six people have died due to the viral outbreak.Goa’s Covid-19 positive count is also comparable with the Union Territory of Ladakh and the north-eastern state of Manipur, which have reported 687 and 606 cases, respectively.State health secretary Nila Mohanan has urged all Goa residents to take the utmost precaution such as strict compliance with social distancing norms, use of face masks and report any flu-like symptoms to the health authorities concerned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-90-of-state-s-705-covid-19-positive-cases-have-been-recorded-in-june/story-gua3qeFwLqWkBeSLqfmrMI.html
19-06-2020||India||BJP and Congress win three RS seats in MP and Rajasthan, Jagan wins all 4 in Andhra||Congress has won two seats from Rajasthan in Rajya Sabha elections, while BJP has won 1 seat from the state, while the saffron party won two out of the three seats on offer from Madhya Pradesh leaving one for the Congress. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s YSRCP has won all four Rajya Sabha seats in Andhra Pradesh, according to news agency ANI.The results for the 19 RS seats that went to polls on Friday are being announced.In Madhya Pradesh, the BJP had fielded senior leader and former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia and former professor of a government college Sumer Singh Solanki.The Congress had fielded veteran leader Digvijaya Singh and Dalit leader Phool Singh Baraiya. Digvijaya Singh was the party’s first candidate.The Congress has 92 MLAs in the MP assembly and it had asked 54 of these to vote for the party’s first preference candidate Digvijaya Singh.PTI quoted officials to say that all three including BJP’s Jyotiraditya Scindia and Sumer Singh Solanki and Congress veteran Digvijaya Singh had been declared elected from Madhya Pradesh.In Rajasthan, Congress candidates K C Venugopal and Neeraj Dangi were declared winner, while Rajendra Gehlot of the BJP also got elected, PTI said quoting an assembly official.The BJP’s second candidate for Rajasthan quota of seats, Onkar Singh Lakhawat lost. With the wins on Friday, the number of Congress party’s Rajya Sabha MPs from Rajasthan has increased to three out of a total of 10. The rest seven are BJP members.The counting of votes for four Rajya Sabha seats in Gujarat was delayed due to a demand by the Congress to invalidate two BJP votes-- by MLA Kesrisinh Solanki and minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama-- on different grounds. The election commission was seized with the matter, PTI reported.The Congress claimed Chudasama’s election to the assembly had been annulled by the Gujarat High Court last month and therefore he was ineligible to vote. The BJP pointed out that the Supreme Court has stayed the HC order. Congress also questioned Solanki’s vote, claiming he was accompanied inside the polling booth by an unauthorised person. The person being referred to, was an assistant Solanki brought to pull his wheelchair, reported PTI.A total of 19 Rajya Sabha seats--- four each from Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, three each from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, two from Jharkhand and one each from Manipur, Mizoram, and Meghalaya—were voted for today.Before the elections were held today, the BJP had 75 members, Congress 39, followed by 13 of the TMC and eight of the Samajwadi Party in the Upper House. TRS and DMK have 7 members each. The party wise tally will change after the results from the elections held today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-and-congress-win-three-rs-seats-in-mp-and-rajasthan-jagan-wins-all-4-in-andhra/story-Bea6V8d4MBzRF1g8fuC7uI.html
19-06-2020||India||Released after 60 hours by China, 10 Indian soldiers undergo debriefing||Intense negotiations through diplomatic and military channels, including three rounds of talks between senior military officers, led to the release of 10 Indian soldiers detained by the Chinese side during the violent brawl of June 15 in Galwan Valley, people familiar with developments said on Friday on the condition of anonymity.The soldiers are being debriefed by senior officials at Leh, the headquarters of the army’s 14 Corps, on the over 60 hours they spent in Chinese custody, said one of the persons cited above.“There’s a protocol for debriefing and that’s being followed,” he said.Another person cited above said the 10 soldiers, including two majors and two captains, were returned to the Indian side on Thursday evening, three days after the violent face-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) left 20 Indian soldiers, including a colonel, dead.“The debriefing is critical. It will be a formatted military narration of what they went through in Chinese captivity. This will form the basis of what really happened during those three days and how was the military posturing and conduct of the people who detained them,” said Lieutenant General AS Lamba (retd), a former army vice chief.The negotiations for their release were kept tightly under wraps due to concerns for the safety of the soldiers amid the heightened tensions between the two sides, said the first person cited above.There was no official word on the development. All that the Indian Army and the external affairs ministry said on Thursday was that no Indian soldiers were “missing in action”.“The release of the Indian soldiers reflects Chinese intent. It perhaps shows the Chinese want to de-escalate and disengage,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations.However, a top retired army commander, who didn’t want to be identified, said China had already achieved what it set out to achieve – gaining control over Galwan Valley and the strategic feature Finger 4 near Pangong Tso where a significant Chinese build up has taken place over the last six weeks.“The gesture of returning the soldiers is a message to the world that they [the Chinese] are not the aggressors and they have returned people who intruded into their territory,” he said.The release of the 10 soldiers figured in three rounds of talks between Indian and Chinese delegations, led by major generals, near Patrol Point 14 in Galway Valley between Tuesday and Thursday. Major General Abhijit Bapat, commander of Karu-based headquarters 3 Infantry Division, and his Chinese counterpart, met for the third time on Thursday.The meetings were part of ongoing military engagements to de-escalate the situation and to disengage on the disputed border. The two senior military officers have met seven times since the stand-off began in early May.The 10 soldiers, after their release, were sent for a medical examination and were found to be in good health, said the second person cited above.Monday night’s seven-hour brutal clash, involving more than 500 rival troops, also marked the first time India suffered combat fatalities in an incident involving Chinese troops since 1975.Following reports that an unspecified number of soldiers were unaccounted for after Monday night’s clash, the Indian Army had on Thursday only said that none of its personnel was missing in action.“It is clarified that there are no Indian troops missing in action,” the army said in a terse statement. An army spokesperson had said the statement was in reference to the article “In China-India Clash, Two Nationalist Leaders with Little Room to Give” published in The New York Times on Wednesday.Asked about the specific issue of the status of Indian soldiers after the clash of June 15, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly media briefing on Thursday: “This has been clarified by the army earlier today afternoon that there are no Indian troops missing in action.”China has so far not acknowledged any casualties among its troops, while 76 Indian soldiers were also injured. Army officials claimed 43 Chinese were killed or seriously injured, citing radio intercepts and other intelligence. The Chinese fatal casualties reportedly include a colonel-ranked officer but HT couldn’t independently verify this.India has attributed the clash of June 15 on Chinese forces crossing to the Indian side of the LAC and attempting to build a structure. It has also rejected China’s People’s Liberation Army’s claim of sovereignty over the Galwan Valley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-soldiers-released-by-china-60-hours-after-ladakh-clash-undergo-debriefing/story-MY66gpr5q7QbgR9KC6zdUL.html
19-06-2020||India||Security personnel deployed outside Chhattisgarh CM’s residence tests Covid-19 positive||A security personnel deployed outside the residence of Chhattisgarh chief minister has tested positive for Covid-19 and was admitted to hospital for treatment, officials said on Friday.“The duty of the security personnel found infected was at the western side gate outside the Chief Minister’s residence, and clearly not inside the residence,” a press release by the public relation department of Chhattisgarh stated.“The security personnel did not enter inside the Chief Minister’s residence. All the prescribed protocols and health safety standards are being followed as precautionary measures,” the release added.The total number of active cases in the state is 735 out of a total 1,946 cases detected in the last three months, as per the state health department’s bulletin. Nine patients have succumbed to the disease while 1,13,329 have been tested so far.Most of the Covid-19 cases detected so far in Chhattisgarh have been in the northern part of the state - Korba , Bilaspur, Baloda Bazar, Raipur and Mungeli districts. No cases were found in the three southern districts of Sukma, Bijapur and Narayanpur.The department’s data, however, revealed that the tests conducted in the southern districts were much less than in the northern non-tribal dominated districts.“Most cases detected are from the migrant community. The parts which have seen large influx of inter-state travellers have shown spike in the cases. In Chhattisgarh, people who came from western part and Uttar Pradesh have particularly been Covid-19 carriers. The southern (tribal dominated) districts so far do not have many such people with travel history and therefore, the cases are less,” said health secretary Niharika Barik Singh.She said the lesser number of tests was done in southern districts because fewer people came under the criterion of Covid-19 testing, which allows testing of only those who show symptoms of the disease. “We have followed ICMR guidelines for testing,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-personnel-deployed-outside-chhattisgarh-cm-s-residence-tests-covid-19-positive/story-PXzeT0z2i7cNRLKx58IRtM.html

He paid tribute to the actor by offering flowers at a simple memorial set up in the family home.The law minister, who also belongs to Patna, shared with the actor’s father his memories of meeting Sushant Singh Rajput during an oath-taking ceremony in May 2019, at the Rashtrapati Bhawan. “Visited Patna home of Sushant Singh Rajput. Met his family members. Paid my condolences. A super talented actor with great promise had to meet such an unfortunate end. Creative acting in films is left poorer with his sad demise. He had to achieve great heights. He deserved more,” the minister tweeted on Friday.Earlier when the news about Sushant Singh Rajput’s death by suicide had emerged on Sunday, Prasad had remembered the Patna boy as a super talented actor who left too soon.The actor was found dead at his house in Bandra and in a case of suicide, the police said, triggering shock and stunned disbelief across the nation.As the Mumbai film industry expressed grief on Twitter, the political establishment also expressed condolences for the actor who rose to stardom with Balaji Telefilms’ television show Pavitra Rishta in the last decade.Sushant Singh Rajput, later became known for films like MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, where he played the titular role, Byomkesh Bakshi and Chhichhore.“Shocked to learn that super talented actor SushantSinghRajput is no more. He was from my city Patna. Remember meeting him in Rashtrapati Bhawan during oath-taking ceremony last year. He had told me that his family lived in Rajiv Nagar, Patna. He had miles to go.

He was referring to the nipah outbreak which was localised and contained effectively in 2018.“More than 200 people died in the Gulf due to covid-19 in the last three months. Our people are desperate to come back. But the government is scared of its numbers and image. It is after records and recognition and shedding crocodile tears for poor expatriates who made Kerala,” he said. The state government, said Ramachandran, should be held responsible for these deaths. Many took to social media to slam the state Congress chief, calling out his speech as “misogynistic and unparliamentary”.CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat and CPI leader Annie Raja sought teh Congress leader’s apology. The CPI(M) youth wing the Democratic Youth Federation of India said the leader’s remarks exposed “culture” of the party.Last week the state had issued an order making a certificate mandatory for all foreign travellers coming to the state but the Centre said it was impractical.After the issue snowballed into a controversy, Ramachandran clarified that his remarks were not against womanhood but against “an insensible government and minister”. He said full credit for fighting virus should go to health workers not to the government which hijacked it.On Thursday, CM Pinarayi Vijayan had suggested that the state will send testing kits to embassies. There are an estimated 18 lakh people from the state in the middle-east and at least four lakh are expected to return. More than 80,000 people have returned in the last one month. The state was forced to take such a decision after 80 per cent of recent cases were found to be imported - people who came from abroad and other states.Kerala was the first state to report a Covid-19 case in the country in January, but has since managed it well with high recovery and lowest mortality rates.The state health minister has been hailed for her leadership role in effectively fighting the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-rani-kerala-congress-chief-mocks-state-health-minister-kk-shailaja/story-mj31o6CN3Y2vgRETTgtyRK.html

19-06-2020||India||SC declines stay on Central Vista redevelopment for the second time||The Supreme Court on Friday declined to stay the redevelopment of Lutyen’s Delhi’s Central Vista for the second time in two months, saying it cannot prevent government authorities from acting according to the law.The bench headed by justice AM Khanwilkar, however, made it clear that any work done on the project will be subject to orders passed by the court in future.The bench clarified this after the government, through its second senior-most law officer, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, told the top court it cannot give any assurance that “no work on the ground” will be done. The case was adjourned till July 7 after the government requested additional time to file its response.The Supreme Court had earlier refused to stay the project when the matter had come up for hearing on April 30.The Central Vista is home to iconic buildings such as the Parliament, Rashtrapati Bhavan and the North and South Block buildings, which house important ministries, and the India Gate.The Union government plans to redevelop the Central Vista by constructing a new Parliament, a new residential complex that will house the prime minister and the vice president and several new office buildings.The petitioners, advocate Rajeev Suri and Lt Col (retired) Anuj Srivastava, told the court on Friday that approvals by various authorities are being granted despite the matter pending before the Supreme Court. They sought a direction from the court that no further construction work should take place for the project even if approvals are granted.“Solicitor general must assure that no further step is taken,” it was urged on behalf of the petitioners. The bench declined to grant such relief and the solicitor general said no such assurance can be given.Suri and Srivastava first approached the Delhi high court in February, challenging a notification issued by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on December 21, 2019 regarding changes in land use for the redevelopment.Suri challenged the alterations envisaged by the central government on the ground that they involve changes to land use and standards of population density, and that DDA doesn’t have the power to bring about such changes. He submitted that this power, if at all, lies with the central government.Srivastava challenged the public hearings held to raise objections to the exercise, arguing they were a mere formality devoid of any meaningful content.A single judge bench granted interim relief to the petitioners on February 11 but this was overturned by the division bench of the high court on February 28. Suri then approached the Supreme Court, challenging the denial of interim relief by the high court.The Supreme Court transferred the entire case to itself from the Delhi high court on March 6, saying in an order that in the “larger public interest, we deem it appropriate that the entire matter pertaining to challenge pending before the high court is heard and decided by this court expeditiously”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-declines-stay-on-central-vista-redevelopment-for-the-second-time/story-Cd5zuhsAiPbY8fjrzzPD6K.html

He added that he decided to take up the chief minister’s position to show that neither the Shiv Sena nor its chief was “helpless” in the alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Thackeray made the statements during an interaction through a digital platform with party MPs, leaders and functionaries on the occasion of the 54th foundation day of the Sena.This is his first formal interaction with party leaders after becoming the chief minister of Maharashtra.“Shiv Sena has not changed its ideology,” Thackeray told party functionaries answering criticism that Sena had abandoned Hindutva after it joined hands with secular parties Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) to form the government in November 2019.He also added that he went to Shivneri Fort, the birthplace of Chhatrapati Shivaji, and Ekveera temple, the family deity of the Thackerays. “I took the soil from Shivneri to Ram Janmabhoomi (Ayodhya) and within a year a decision was announced on the Ram Temple case, and later, I became the chief minister.”Also Read: Maharashtra CM reiterates stand over scrapping final-year examsIn an indirect jibe at the BJP, Thackeray said, “I am sitting here as the chief minister because there was an attempt to play politics with us and we foiled it… Trusting isn’t our weakness but it’s our culture. Shiv Sena is not helpless, nor is the Shiv Sena chief,” he said.Nearly seven months after Thackeray took over as the CM, Shiv Sena is now eyeing the prime minister’s post in the future. Thackeray said that a Shiv Sainik would lead the country in the future.“[Senior Sena leader and MP] Sanjay Raut told Uddhav ji that we are now looking at him to lead the country. He responded saying that he would not, but a Shiv Sainik would lead the country in future,” Sena MP Anil Desai said.Incidentally, Thackeray had taken a similar stance for the position of Maharashtra’s chief minister before political compulsions led to him taking over the reins of the state government.Also Read: Covid-19 patients, family must get test report: Supreme Court tells Maharashtra govtThe Sena chief also looked to bridge the alleged distance between him and party functionaries as there is a sense that Thackeray is no longer managing the party closely after taking over as the CM.“My interactions with you may have reduced after becoming the chief minister, but I will not let it create distance between us,” he told leaders and functionaries.Before the interaction with party leaders, Thackeray along with son and Yuva Sena chief Aaditya Thackeray hoisted party’s saffron flag atop the party headquarters at Shiv Sena Bhavan in Dadar. Senior party leaders including Diwakar Raote, Eknath Shinde, Sanjay Raut, Chandrakant Khaire, Gajanan Kirtikar, Aaditya Thackeray, Anil Desai, MLA Sada Sarvankar were also present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sainik-to-lead-the-country-in-future-uddhav-thackeray-on-sena-foundation-day/story-zj6lYCnfiV9zahgJZsEZPL.html

Several vehicles have been damaged. Since the containers are not temperature-controlled, a large quantity of fruit has also been rotting because of delay in shipping, the traders said.The traders have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, seeking a relief package to cover their losses.Though many orchards were damaged by Cyclone Amphan on May 20, Malda is expected to produce more than 3,00,000 metric tons of mango crop this year. Traders claim that no district in India produces more.Ujjal Saha, president, Malda Mango Merchants’ Association, said, “We were expecting a production of at least one lakh metric ton more this year but the cyclone played spoilsport. The orchards are spread across 31,000 hectares.”“More than 5,00,000 people in Malda district are directly or indirectly associated with the mango trade. We have suffered a loss of more than Rs 100 crore because of the cyclone and now shipments to Jharkhand, Bihar, Assam and Odisha have been hit because of bad roads,” Saha said.“Most traders use NH-34 to send the shipments. The monsoon has damaged the highway and craters have been found in many places. This is delaying shipments. Traders cannot afford temperature-controlled containers,” Saha added.According to the traders, the condition of the highway is exceptionally poor in Fatullapur, Jadupur, Narayanpur, Islampur and some areas in Murshidabad, Nadia and North 24 Parganas district. A sizeable quantity of Malda mango is consumed in Kolkata.Nimai Biswas, secretary of the Malda Bus and Minibus Owners’ Association, said the issue raised by mango traders is a raging one.“NH-34 and its bypass are both in very poor condition. Our vehicles get damaged everyday but the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has not taken any action so far,” Biswas said.Project director of NHAI (Malda Division) Dinesh Hangsaria said, “It is not possible to start the repair work right now because of continuous rainfall.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mango-shipments-from-bengal-s-malda-hit-craters-on-nh-34-traders-appeal-to-pm-modi/story-DNN8ZhgK6zh1iWr6TDJQLL.html

Sarkar, the leader of opposition in the state assembly, made this comment while addressing a condolence meeting organised by the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-affiliated Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) for three of their leaders on Thursday evening. CITU leaders Pijush Nag, Subrata Sarkar, and Kajal Ghosh died of old age-related ailments over the past three months.“We pay our homage to the Indian soldiers, who were martyred along the LAC. We hope that both countries would start a dialogue to end the stand-off. India and China should be good neighbours for mutual co-existence. We wish the stand-off be resolved soon. That will be good for all,” said Sarkar.On a separate note, the ex-CM alleged that the country witnessed misrule since the Narendra Modi-led government came to power six years and cited a raft of “draconian measures” such as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA); the revision of National Register of Citizens (NRC); the National Population Register (NPR), anti-labour policies like low wages, increasing working hours from eight to 12, reducing holidays and allowances, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/resolve-galwan-standoff-through-proper-dialogue-former-tripura-cm/story-MqjQjPS2jOS29FgGPoy0QK.html

China has confirmed that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) suffered casualties but has dodged repeated questions from international media about details of the clash.Twenty Indian soldiers including a colonel-ranked officer were killed in the violent scrap, the first Indian casualties in a clash with the PLA in 45 years.“This was the first clash of its kind on the Line of Actual Control because India has the capability and the will to stand up to an aggressive China,” a top military commander told Hindustan Times.Chinese troops, which had mobilised soldiers along the Line of Actual Control and set up a stand-off with India for nearly six weeks, refused to back down in line with the understanding reached between top commanders of the two armies on June 6. What started off as an argument between local commanders of the two sides on June 15 evening after the PLA attempted to build a structure on the Indian side during the de-escalation process soon spiralled into a full-blown fisticuffs.Also read | HT Exclusive: Galwan river bridge that China tried to stop in Ladakh is complete, says officialA senior government official said the PLA clearly was attempting to execute its “Walk in Strategy” in Galwan. But this was contested and China had to pay the price with equal, if not more. According to inputs available with South Block, the PLA had to evacuate nearly 35 soldiers and officers who were either injured or had died in the clash. “Our information indicates that the Chinese side lost the commanding officer of the battalion deployed near Patrolling Point 14 of the Galwan region where the two armies clashed. The battalion’s second-in-command also died in the incident,” a senior official at South Block said.India has blamed China for the clash, underscoring that the Chinese side had “unilaterally attempted to change the status quo there” and took “premeditated and planned action that was directly responsible for the resulting violence and casualties suffered by both sides”.Officials said the bloody face-off at Galwan would be a turning point in relations between the two countries, not just because of the bitterness that is likely to creep into relations between the two giants but also because of the message that it had sent.“This face-off has demonstrated that Ladakh isn’t the South China Sea where the Chinese would be able to unilaterally change the status quo,” one of them said.It also marks a perceptible shift in the way India handles issues relating to the border and sovereignty, he said.“Thus far, undemarcated borders were being managed through protocols and agreements where military actions were not employed. This incident makes it clear that if Beijing disregards agreements and attempts to unilaterally change the status quo, the Indian army is prepared to deal with the situation, firmly,” a senior government functionary told Hindustan Times.Also read | On Ladakh border incident, China official asked 6 questions. Answers noneThis is the message that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had delivered this week as well. That India wanted and worked for peace but if provoked, was capable of giving “a befitting reply”. PM Modi is expected to underscore the same message on the India-China border at the all party meeting that he has convened.Political will to take on China, a senior defence ministry official said, is only one of the reasons why it has been possible for India to take this approach. There has been a massive improvement in India’s military capabilities over the last few years, both in terms of force levels, training, procedures and most importantly, battle hardened troops.The military also has access to better weaponry under the modernisation plan, he said, conceding that it hadn’t moved as fast as the government would have liked it to proceed. The armed forces, he said, also have the advantage in application of air power and superior capability at sea. And a rapidly improving border infrastructure that had, in the first place, irked the Chinese because this would enable the military to exercise better control of the areas along the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ladakh-isn-t-south-china-sea-will-not-allow-status-quo-to-change-official/story-iBZonBNAE0qo3MywqQdADJ.html

19-06-2020||India||‘China has no detained Indian army personnel at present’: Official||China has no detained Indian soldiers at present, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Friday hours after it emerged that 10 Indian Army personnel captured by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had been freed after intense negotiations on Thursday.The Indian soldiers were captured following the bloody confrontation with Chinese troops near the Galwan Valley area of eastern Ladakh on Monday.Twenty Indian soldiers, including a colonel, died in the line of duty in the violent face-off that has shattered years of tenuous peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and plunged bilateral ties to a deep low in decades.“As far as I know, China has no detained Indian personnel at present,”Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, said at the regular press conference on Friday.Earlier in the day, HT had reported that 10 soldiers, including at least two officers, were returned to the Indian, three days after the brutal combat along the LAC.These negotiations were kept tightly under wraps due to concerns for the safety of the soldiers amid the heightened tensions between the two sides, people familiar with developments said.Asked to comment on calls in India to boycott Chinese goods and the possibility of New Delhi launching anti-dumping investigations, Zhao said: “China values our bilateral relations. Hope India can work with China to maintain the long-term development of bilateral relations”.At the same time, Zhao reiterated Beijing’s consistent stand that India was to blame for the conflict.“I like to reiterate that regarding the serious situation in the Galwan Valley, the right and wrong is very clear. The responsibility entirely lies with the Indian side.”The foreign ministry spokesperson continued to parry queries on PLA’s casualties.“China and India are in dialogue to resolve the matter on the ground through diplomatic and military channels. I do not have any information for you at the moment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-has-no-detained-indian-army-personnel-at-present-official/story-kyVUUpAeaz3Ukk5swqK6zH.html
19-06-2020||India||How violet ink became colour for marking Rajya Sabha votes||In 2016, the Election Commission, which has the mandate to hold elections for the Rajya Sabha, announced that a specially manufactured violet sketch pen will be given to voters for the polls.The special pen with violet ink was introduced following the so-called “ink controversy” that erupted in Haryana after 12 votes cast with markings in the wrong ink were declared invalid.These 12 votes were of Congress legislators, and led to the defeat of party-backed independent candidate and lawyer RK Anand, who lost to Subhash Chandra, backed by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Two more votes were declared invalid as the ballot was unmarked in one and Randeep Singh Surjewala’s vote was rejected as he showed his vote to another legislator, Kiran Chaudhary.The development stoked a political furore and the Congress and the INLD had asked the Election Commission to countermand the election to both Rajya Sabha seats.After a working group of senior officials suggested ways to prevent a repeat of the ink fiasco in future Rajya Sabha polls, the Election Commission made it mandatory for all voters to use only the pen provided by polling officials. Votes marked in any other colour are deemed invalid.Since then the Election Commission provides the pens with violet ink, and these are kept inside voting booths and voters are not allowed to remove them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-violet-ink-became-colour-for-marking-rajya-sabha-votes/story-gYJ6frdM1MjIepw4KChduJ.html

Earlier on Wednesday, the committee had recommended that rates for RT-PCR kits should be capped at Rs 2,400, a decision which has been accepted by the Delhi government and laboratories have already been informed in this regard.Delhi’s infection tally stands at 49,979 and 1,969 people have died due to the coronavirus disease as of Friday.The home ministry also said that, as discussed in the Sunday meeting, a door-to-door survey has already been completed in 242 containment zones in Delhi covering a total of 2.3 lakh people so far.It added that testing through rapid antigen testing methodology, started on Thursday, 7,040 people have been tested as of now in 193 centres and that this number would go up in coming days. “Testing will continue with increased number in coming days,” said Wakankar.The ministry further informed that the samples tested have been doubled in the capital in line with the directions given by Amit Shah in a series of meetings with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, all municipal corporations of Delhi and hospital authorities.“Sample testing has been doubled immediately in pursuance of decisions taken by HM Amit Shah in a series of meetings. A total of testing samples of 27,263 have been collected in Delhi from June 15 to 17 against the daily collection which varied between 4,000 and 4,500 earlier,” the spokesperson said.Shah had asked the Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments to work together for the welfare of people of the national capital region rather than working in silos.A senior MHA official, who didn’t want to be named, said that the home minister is closely monitoring the situation in Delhi and may call more review meetings in coming days if he sees the situation going out of hand. “For now, things start to look like they are getting back on track (in terms of testing),” said this officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/slash-rates-of-delhi-s-isolation-beds-by-more-than-half-suggests-central-panel/story-129Uxukqzmabqz8180WahO.html
19-06-2020||India||States asked to replicate initiatives taken by Karnataka for Covid-19 management||The Centre has asked all states to replicate the best practices implemented by Karnataka which includes comprehensive contact tracing of Covid-19 cases and physical or phone based household survey, for better management of the coronavirus pandemic. The Union Health Ministry on Friday lauded the two initiatives taken by Karnataka that have been developed as part of the ‘whole of government’ approach with the involvement of multi-sectoral agencies and supported by technology based solutions and interventions. They effectively trace and track each case thereby successfully containing the spread of the epidemic, the ministry said. “The Centre has asked the other states to adapt these best practices to their local context and replicate them for better management of the Covid-19 pandemic,” the ministry said in its statement.India on Friday added 13,586 new Covid-19 cases, the highest recorded in a single day so far, pushing the tally to 3,80,532, while the death toll rose to 12,573 with 336 new fatalities, according to Health Ministry data.Karnataka has reported 114 deaths and 7,944 cases, according to the data updated at 8 am.Contact tracing is a critical component towards containing the epidemic and ensuring that the health infrastructure does not get overwhelmed. Karnataka has widened the definition of ‘contact’ to include both the high-risk as well as low-risk contacts as defined by the central government. The number of primary and secondary contacts in Karnataka were meticulously traced and put under strict quarantine, the ministry said. More than 10,000 well trained field staff carried out specific responsibilities for contact tracing as per the detailed SOP designed by the state which prescribes step-by-step actions to be performed by each designated person. Contact tracing mobile app and web applications are being used to overcome the huge quantum of work, genuine forgetfulness of the positive persons and attempts to hide facts due to various reasons, the statement said. The State has been able to curtail the spread of infection in slums of big corporation areas through compulsory institutional quarantine of the contacts residing in slums or similar areas. It has also been made mandatory for all returnees and travellers coming to Karnataka to register on “Seva Sindhu” portal, which enables the state to follow them for the next few days when they are in home or institutional quarantine. The ‘Quarantine Watch App’ is used to assist the field workers in enforcing the quarantine. The state has also formed mobile squads for enforcement of the home quarantine through community participation. In case information is received from the neighbour or public about violation of quarantine by any person, that person is moved to institutional quarantine. With a view to identifying, protecting and treating high risk population like the elderly, persons with co-morbidities, pregnant women and those with Influenza like Illness (ILI)/ Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) on priority, Karnataka has conducted a physical/phone based household survey, the ministry said. The survey was carried out during May and covered 153 lakh households out of total 168 lakh total households. Polling Booth Level Officers (BLO) were engaged to collect necessary information by using a Health Survey App as well as a web application. The data collected through the survey was complemented by the information already available with the Health Department for pregnant mothers and TB/HIV/Dialysis/Cancer patients. An outreach campaign through Apthamitra tele-consultation helpline (14410) set up by the state government, with support from NASSCOM, is being used to reach out to the households at risk through interactive voice response system (IVRS) and outbound calls. The households reporting anyone with Covid-19 like symptoms are triaged by a telemedicine doctor and further advised. Field level health worker (ASHAs) also visit these households to ensure that the required healthcare service is provided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-asked-to-replicate-initiatives-taken-by-karnataka-for-covid-19-management/story-vlK4QTl3FXqdPpNvAY9n8N.html
19-06-2020||India||J-K forces compliment Valley youth for choosing ‘peace’ despite Pak provocation||The security forces in Jammu and Kashmir on Friday complimented the residents of Kashmir for showing “faith in peace” and particularly the youth for walking on the “path of peace” despite “huge provocation” by Pakistan and its agencies involved in the business of terror.A routine security press conference helmed by General Officer Commanding (GOC) 15 Corps Lt Gen Baggavalli Somashekar Raju and Jammu and Kashmir Director General of Police (DGP) Dilbag Singh made the above observations while briefing the media on encounters in Pampore’s Meej and Shopian’s Munand in Jammu and Kashmir in the last 24 hours that led to elimination of eight terrorists in two different operations.The senior security officers added that the last 18 months or so have been one of the most peaceful in terms of handling law and order in general in the region.“I compliment the people of Kashmir because they have faith in peace and it is their belief which is leading to these successful operations and I’m sure that at the end of next few months they’ll be able to take this process forward and ensure that normalcy is brought in,” the GOC 15 Corps was quoted as saying by ANI.The forces were briefing the media on two encounters in south Kashmir’s Pulwama and Shopian districts in the last 24 hours leading to the killing of eight terrorists, including six on Friday.Also Read: 6 terrorists killed in simultaneous encounters in J-K’s Pulwama and ShopianThe officers said local support for terrorism had come down signalling a rethinking amongst the youth of the Valley.“I would also like to compliment our youth, who are moving on a peaceful path despite huge provocation by Pakistan and its agencies involved in terror business. Perhaps, they’ve started seeing through the game plan of these agencies which brought violence and destruction here,” said J&K DGP.He added that the last 18 months have been one of the most peaceful in terms of the cooperation extended by the locals in handling anti-terror operation sites.“It gives me immense pleasure to say that the complete last year and about 5 and a half months of this year have been one of the most peaceful months we had, in terms of handling law & order in general & around the operation sites. It happened only because people are cooperating,” Dilbagh Singh added.The presence of Indian security forces in Jammu and Kashmir was raised last year in anticipation of trouble fomented by Pakistan after Indian Parliament’s decision to scrap Article 370 which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcate the erstwhile state into two Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh. The officers added that some new recruits into terror organizations had been neutralized.“Of the 49 new recruits who got enrolled into ranks of terrorist tanzims, 27 have been neutralised. It doesn’t give us any pleasure to neutralise these boys but if anybody takes up arms and causes harm to others, we’ll do what we’re doing,” said Lt Gen Baggavalli Somashekar Raju.Regarding the operation conducted over the last 24 hours, the GOC of 15 Corps specifically mentioned that extreme restraint was exercised by the security forces to ensure that no damage was caused to a mosque in Pampore’s Meej where three terrorists were neutralized.Kashmir’s Pashmina: India-China Himalayan standoff deadly for cashmere herdsThe Pulwama encounter started during a cordon and search operation at Meej in the Pampore area on Thursday morning when terrorists fired on the forces. One terrorist was killed in the gunfight yesterday but two others entered a nearby mosque to take refuge. On Friday morning, security forces used tear smoke shells to force the holed up terrorists out of the mosque before they were killed while maintaining the sanctity of the religious place.DGP Dilbag Singh had chaired a high level meeting of police , BSF and army officers on Thursday to review the security scenario in view of the Ladakh standoff at the border.He had said that Pakistan will try to push more terrorists to give impetus to violence in Kashmir Valley and elsewhere in view of the Ladakh standoff and added that the border alongside Pakistan needs extra attention in view of the Ladakh developments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-forces-compliment-valley-youth-for-choosing-peace-despite-pak-provocation/story-JYV0GwUe5qTfq7iFZXw0oO.html

19-06-2020||India||China’s recent actions maybe a step towards shaping post-pandemic global order: Experts||Is China using the world’s preoccupation with the Covid-19 crisis to enlarge its position on several border disputes and target rivals that could have a say in shaping the post-pandemic global order?That’s a question now being debated by experts and analysts following a string of actions by China over the past few weeks and months.India-China border standoff:The most urgent of the crises is the tense weeks-old face-off between Indian and Chinese border troops in the Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that has sparked at least three clashes since early May, the latest being the violent brawl of June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers dead.India has accused China of taking “pre-meditated and planned action” that reflected an intent to change the status quo on the LAC.ALSO READ | China releases 10 Indian soldiers after intense negotiationsReasons advanced for China’s actions have ranged from anger over India’s beefing up of infrastructure along the strategic Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) road and India’s decision last August to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and create the union territory of Ladakh, which Beijing has indicated had an impact on its territorial claims in the region. Experts have also pointed to China’s desire to protect its considerable investments in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a key part of which is located in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Australia cyber attack:The Australian government said on Friday it was dealing with a massive cyber attack targeting all levels of the administration, industry, education, essential services, critical infrastructure and political organisations. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said a malicious and sophisticated “state-based cyber actor” was behind the attack, adding that “there are not a large number of state-based actors that can engage in this type of activity”.Though Morrison didn’t name any country, Australian experts and observers pointed the finger of blame at China. Peter Jennings, executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told CNN there was a “95% chance that it is China who is responsible for this attack”.Australia has been vocal in recent months about an international investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic and backed India’s calls for reforms of the World Health Organization (WHO) for its initial handling of the crisis. China retaliated with tariffs on Australian exports, including barley and beef. India and Australia have also spoken about working together to shape the post-Covid world order.South China Sea:There has been no let-up in China’s activities to bolster its presence in the South China Sea, where it is embroiled in maritime boundary disputes with several countries, despite the Covid-19 pandemic. A Vietnamese vessel was rammed by a Chinese ship near Paracel Islands on June 10, months after another Vietnamese boat was sunk by China’s coast guard in the same area. Numerous Chinese vessels have been spotted near Thitu Island, controlled by the Philippines but claimed by China. ALSO READ | World busy with Covid-19, Beijing pushes South China Sea agendaEarlier this month, Filipino authorities launched work on critical infrastructure on Thitu, located just 24 km from an artificial island created by China and equipped with radars and missiles. Over the past two months, an exploration vessel operated by Malaysia’s state-run oil company Petronas has been harassed in the South China Sea by Chinese vessels.Of these three countries, Vietnam has often turned to India to back its position in the South China Sea. Last year, Chinese vessels repeatedly operated in areas close to the waters where state-owned ONGC Videsh is engaged in oil and gas production.Senkaku Islands:On Thursday, China set a new record of sorts by sending its vessels into waters off the Senkaku Islands for 66 consecutive days. The islands in the East China Sea are controlled by Tokyo but claimed by Beijing, and Chinese vessels have been spotted in Japan’s “contiguous zone” every day since April 14. The contiguous zone is the area beyond the territorial sea and extending up to 24 nautical miles from the baseline that a country can claim. Technically, the presence of the Chinese vessels is not an intrusion but Japan regards it as a provocation. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told the media on Wednesday the Senkaku islands are “unquestionably our territory historically and under international law” and that a protest had been lodged with China over the presence of the vessels. “We think it is extremely serious that these activities continue,” he said.Both Japan and India are part of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, which was upgraded to the level of foreign ministers last September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-s-recent-actions-maybe-a-step-towards-shaping-post-pandemic-global-order-experts/story-H73EmguaoIXGD7Rk2Ahx6L.html
19-06-2020||India||How was Galwan Valley named? Explorer’s grandson explains||Galwan Valley, the place where a clash took place on Monday night between Indian and Chinese soldiers, has been named after local explorer Ghulam Rasool Galwan.Rasool’s grandson Mohammad Amin Galwan said that his grandfather was the first to cross the valley while trekking with the British in 1895.“The weather turned bad and it was difficult to save the British team. Death was in front of their eyes. Rasool Galwan steered the team to the destination,” he told news agency IANS. “The British were happy and asked him what reward he wants, he said I don’t need anything but name the nallah on my name,” Galwan added.“During British time, the area was named Galwan Rasool or Galwan Nala,” he said.Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the clash in this valley in Ladakh on June 15. A Colonel was among those killed. The face-off happened as a result of an attempt by the Chinese troops to “unilaterally change” the status quo during de-escalation in eastern Ladakh, India said. The situation could have been avoided if the agreement at the higher level been scrupulously followed by the Chinese side, the foreign ministry said.Speaking about the current stand-off, Amin Galwan said he salutes the jawans who made the supreme sacrifice in Galwan Valley.“In 1962, the Chinese entered that area and our brave soldiers pushed them back. There are a lot of activities happening in that area these days. Our jawans are standing their ground. The area belongs to us for the last over 200 years and it will remain so,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-was-galwan-valley-named-explorer-s-grandson-explains/story-IARlVZ97v68UUBQAZPtExK.html

19-06-2020||India||Covid-19 positive Cong MLA in PPE suit votes in RS polls in Madhya Pradesh||Voting for three vacant Rajya Sabha seats in Madhya Pradesh concluded on Friday afternoon after all the 206 MLAs, including a Congress legislator who has tested Covid-19 positive, cast their votes.Voting began at 9 am in the state assembly complex here and ended around 1.15 pm, an assembly official said.The Congress legislator, who is a Covid-19 patient, was the last one to cast his ballot wearing a PPE suit. He came to the assembly complex in an ambulance, the official said.Both the parties- the BJP and the Congress- had fielded two candidates each for the three seats of the Upper House of Parliament.While the BJP fielded senior leader and former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia and former professor of a government college, Sumer Singh Solanki, from the Congress’s side, veteran politician Digvijaya Singh and Dalit leader Phool Singh Baraiya were in the fray.BJP members, including state Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, cast their votes in the morning.Former chief minister Kamal Nath and other Congress leaders also cast their ballots soon after the process began.Chouhan was the first member to cast vote, followed by the Home Minister Narottam Mishra.The members were seen wearing masks and standing in a queue maintaining social distance in view of Covid-19 pandemic. For winning a seat in the Rajya Sabha polls from MP, a candidate needs 52 votes. As per the numerical strength of the two parties, BJP is set to win two seats as it has 107 MLAs of its own and has the support of two MLAs of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), one MLA of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and two Independents, party sources said.The saffron party has the support of 112 in the 230 member Assembly whose effective strength is 206. Scindia and Solanki, thus, can get the 52 votes each needed for victory.Leaders of the BSP and the SP said they voted in favour of the BJP. Talking to reporters after the polls, SP’s Rajesh Shukla said, “It is our compulsion to go with the government.I have voted for the BJP on my own for the development of the area. There was no directive from the party leadership on the issue.” BSP’s Sanjeev Kushwaha said, “The Congress government collapsed not because of us, but due to its internal differences. There was no directive from the party for us.Therefore, we voted for the BJP on our own for the development of our region. The BSP will contest the upcoming by-polls on all the seats.” In the 230-member Madhya Pradesh assembly, 24 seats are currently vacant.Congress has been left with 92 MLAs after 22 of its legislators, including six who were ministers then, quit the party in support of Scindia’s move to join the BJP.Thus, Congress is set to win a single seat out of the total three for which polls are being held, sources added.The Congress Legislature Party (CLP) had asked 54 of its 92 MLAs to cast their first preference vote for Digvijaya Singh. The former chief minister needs 52 votes to get elected to Rajya Sabha for the second consecutive term.Baraiya, placed after Singh in the pecking order by his party, does not have the numbers on his side to win.The counting of votes will begin at 5 pm.

19-06-2020||India||Supreme Court asks Centre to fix Covid-19 test rates across country||Taking note of dissimilarity in Covid-19 testing rates across states, the Supreme Court on Friday asked the Centre to decide on the issue, and said all states should set up a panel of experts to inspect hospitals to ensure proper care of patients.A bench comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan, S K Kaul and MR Shah, which would pass the order later, observed during the hearing that there should be uniformity in rates charged across all states.It indicated however that the court will not venture into the fixation of the charges which will be taken care of by the Centre.It said the court may also consider passing an order for installation of CCTVs in hospitals to ensure monitoring of patient care. In the last week of May, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) removed the price cap of Rs 4,500 for the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test used to detect coronavirus disease (Covid-19), allowing the states a free hand to negotiate with the approved list of laboratories and fix the cost to conduct Covid-19 test.At the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the ICMR said, there was a global crisis of testing kits and reagents, as India was heavily reliant on imported products for molecular detection of viruses. No rates for RT-PCR test for coronavirus were available for ready reference in the country, the top medical body said. The cost of imported kits and efforts involved in carrying out the test made the ICMR to suggest the upper limit of a single test at Rs 4,500.Since then the government has been working with domestic manufacturers to bring down the cost and develop kits. The ICMR this week recommended use of antigen-based testing kits for diagnosis that is likely to bring down the cost of testing. However, hospitals say the kit is not readily available in market yet.Earlier today, in relief to Covid-19 patients in Delhi, which has seen a sudden rise in cases over the past week, a panel set up by the Union home ministry has recommended lowering the cost of isolation beds and treatment at the intensive care units at the private hospitals in the national capital.On Monday, the Telangana government capped the cost of Covid-19 tests and treatment at private labs and hospitals across the state. State health minister Eatala Rajender said the private labs authorised by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in the state would not charge more than Rs 2,200 per person for a single Covid-19 diagnostic test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-asks-centre-to-fix-covid-19-test-rates-across-country-install-cameras-in-wards/story-YkdovlN5GzQMjzTuNBWTrN.html

The bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan passed the order. The direction came as part of the suo moto monitoring by the top court of facilities to Covid-19 patients. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had issued a circular on June 13 which said that the test report will not be shared by the laboratory directly with the patient.“Laboratory will share the report with MCGM (Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai) and MCGM in return will share it with the patients,” the circular had said.The Indian Medical Association (IMA), as well as doctors, had complained against the circular, saying it is leading to delays in the treatment of Covid-19 patients.“Because of the new rule, the patients come to know about the result of the test after three to four days, and during this time their symptoms may aggravate and may become serious,” IMA had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-patients-family-must-get-test-report-supreme-court-tells-maharashtra-govt/story-xaHpRLAJLNaNuYxdk8tMHN.html

We are an independent party, which keeps distance from both the BJP and the Congress,” Mahesh Vasava told reporters.“My father and I have decided not to cast our votes until we get an assurance about the implementation of schedule 5 of the Constitution and PESA Act. Although our votes are important, people whom we represent are more important to us,” he added.Also read| Battle for 19 Rajya Sabha seats today: All you need to knowPESA Act refers to the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act.“Despite repeated representation to both the parties in the past, they did nothing for the welfare of ST, SC, OBC, minority and migrant workers,” he alleged.“We will think about voting only after getting an assurance,” Vasava said.Both BJP and Congress are hopeful of getting those two crucial votes of the BTP.Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani said, “The BJP and its governments have done numerous things for the welfare of tribals. A separate ministry for tribal welfare was created when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the prime minister.” “The Gujarat government under Narendra Modi had spent crores on tribal-centric schemes. PESA Act came into effect in Gujarat under my rule. I am confident that the BTP will vote in BJP’s favour,” he said.Gujarat Congress president Amit Chavda also expressed confidence that the BTP MLAs would support his party in the election.“It was the Congress government at the Centre that had pushed forward the PESA Act. Our MLAs fought for its implementation inside and outside the Gujarat Assembly.Congress and BTP have a similar ideology and we are confident of getting their votes,” he said.The BJP, which has the strength of 103 in the Gujarat Assembly, requires two more votes for a comfortable victory of its all the three candidates. So for the BJP, the votes of the BTP are crucial.But if these two votes go to Congress, the party may inch closer to victory on both the seats, but may not get an absolute majority to win the second seat.Congress requires 70 votes and has 65 of its own and one Independent MLA, Jignesh Mewani, supporting them.Rajya Sabha election for four seats in Gujarat became necessary as the BJP decided to field a third candidate, taking the number of candidates in the fray to five.While the Congress has fielded Shaktisinh Gohil and Bharatsinh Solanki, the BJP has fielded Abhay Bhardwaj, Ramilaben Bara and Narhari Amin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-btp-mlas-in-gujarat-decide-not-to-vote-in-rajya-sabha-polls-over-their-demands/story-BO0395BjsD907VRTm0I0lO.html
19-06-2020||India||HT Exclusive: Galwan river bridge that China tried to stop in Ladakh is complete, says official||Army engineers have completed a 60-metre bridge over Galwan river in eastern Ladakh that would consolidate India’s hold of the sensitive sector by allowing Indian infantry to move across the cold mountain river and also protect the 255 km strategic road from Darbuk to Daulat Beg Oldie, the last military post just south of the Karakoram Pass, top officials told Hindustan Times. The bridge was built by the formation engineers despite the PLA showing hostile moves in the area in an effort to force Indian Army to abandon the project.The construction of the strategic bridge was seen as one of the triggers for the aggressive maneuvers by China’s People’s Liberation Army in eastern Ladakh that led to the stand-off between the two countries before Western Theatre Command of PLA made an “exaggerated” claim to the entire Galwan river Valley.A senior government official said the bridge was completed on Thursday, signalling that the border infrastructure upgrade projects being executed by the formation engineers and the Border Roads Organisation will continue despite the PLA’s attempts to stall them.The four-span bridge is located three kilometres east of the Shyok river-Galwan river confluence with the contested Patrolling Point 14 a further 2 km east of the Bailey bridge. Patrolling point 14, which was the site of the June 15 fisticuffs, is close to the Y-junction where the Galwan rivulet joins the main river. An Indian army base camp, called ‘120 km camp’ is on the confluence of the two rivers and next to the DSDBO road. “We did not pause work on this bridge through the stand-off and kept working despite the violent face-off on June 15,” a senior army officer said.Also Watch | Explained: Amid Ladakh clash, India to cancel Chinese firm’s deal for poor work The Chinese tall claim of holding the entire Galwan river valley is an attempt to reduce the Indian claim line to the Shyok river. If this happens, then the Chinese can overrun the DSDBO road in times of hostility and cut the road to Dault Beg Oldie. This will allow them to open another road to Pakistan via Murgo, the last Indian village before DBO.The Bailey bridge built on concrete pillars gives India a major advantage in terms of access and military mobilisation and is considered vital to protection of indian strategic interests. With Indian Army vehicles now being able to cross the Galvan River, the troops now have other military options available against the aggressive PLA in case of worst case scenario. The bridge replaces a footbridge on the Galwan River.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/galwan-valley-bridge-that-china-tried-to-stop-in-ladakh-is-complete-official/story-ODJ7CHLEtwr1Wn34kZnEkM.html

Though the incident had occurred in 2018, the matter came to light last year after the victim’s mother lodged a complaint against her husband and the brother-in-law in Varanasi, where she is currently staying with her daughter following a family discord.Last September, the Uttar Pradesh Police had transferred the case to Haldwani.“Two persons were arrested on Thursday for allegedly raping the minor on two separate occasions at their home in Haldwani. They were booked for rape under the relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, and the Indian Penal Code (IPC),” said a police official, requesting anonymity.“The complainant started staying separately from her accused husband following a family discord. The victim narrated her ordeal to her mother following which she lodged a complaint at a local police station in Varanasi,” he added.The police attributed the delay in the arrests to receiving the relevant documents late and also because the complainant had wanted to shift the case back to Varanasi.“The accused were produced before a court on Thursday and were later sent to police custody. A probe is on,” said Amit Shrivastava, additional superintendent of police (ASP), Haldwani (city).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-doctor-his-elder-brother-arrested-for-raping-7-year-old-daughter/story-o6oidAWojHA1lLT38fFt6N.html

19-06-2020||India||Covid-19: CSIR institute to conduct clinical trials of antiviral drug Umifenovir||The CSIR -- Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) Lucknow, has got the nod for carrying out clinical trial of antiviral drug Umifenovir for treating coronavirus patients, according to a statement.The Phase III clinical trials will be carried out at King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS) and ERA’s Lucknow Medical College & Hospital, Lucknow, it added. The drug has a good safety profile and acts by preventing entry of viruses into human cells and also by priming the immune system, it added. Umifenovir is mainly used for treatment of influenza and is available in China and Russia, and has recently come into prominence due to its potential use for Covid-19 patients. To evaluate its efficacy in Indian patients, CSIR-CDRI has taken up the clinical trial. Further, it has developed the process technology for Umifenovir in record time and licensed the economical process technology for manufacturing and marketing the drug to M/s. Medizest Pharmaceuticals Private Ltd. Goa, which has already received a test license from DCGI, it added.Prof. Tapas Kundu, Director CSIR-CDRI, said all the raw materials for the drug are indigenously available and if the clinical trial is successful, Umifenovir can be a safe, efficacious, affordable drug against COVID-19. He added that the drug has the potential for prophylactic use.Dr Shekhar Mande, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), highlighted that this clinical trial is an integral part of the CSIR strategy of repurposing drugs for Covid-19. “The clinical trial application was processed on high priority as per the DCGIs initiative against Covid-19. The next steps of the trial are being fast tracked to enable the availability of the drug to Indian patients as soon as possible,” the statement added.CSIR labs have been trying to repurpose different drugs for treating coronavirus patients. For the last three months, the Drug Controller General of India has allowed the use of Favipiravir drug, developed within the country by a CSIR laboratory, for clinical trials to treat coronavirus patients.In another case, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), has tied up with Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd to evaluate Mycobacterium W (Mw) for faster recovery of hospitalised Covid-19 infected patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-csir-institute-to-conduct-clinical-trials-of-antiviral-drug-umifenovir/story-JA6S6qzibAWNLEdYwARPXL.html
19-06-2020||India||Delhi-NCR: Small magnitude earthquakes do not indicate a bigger one is coming, says Wadia Institute||Small magnitude earthquakes in Delhi-NCR region do not indicate a bigger temblor is coming, the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology said on Friday.The Dehradun-based autonomous research institute under the Union science and technology ministry clarified that the vulnerability of a region can be understood from past seismicity, calculation of strain and mapping of active faults.Delhi-NCR is in the second highest seismic hazard zone or Zone IV.Sometimes a vulnerable zone remains quiet, experiences small magnitude earthquakes that do not indicate any bigger earthquake, or can receive a sudden jolt by a big earthquake without any call, the institute said in a statement.HT had reported on June 4 that Delhi-NCR witnessed at least 14 earthquakes in around two months (March 24 to June 3). A 3- magnitude earthquake was recorded near Gautam Budh Nagar on Wednesday night, according to data from the National Center for Seismology.All earthquakes in the past two months have been mild with only two above 3.5 magnitude. On May 29, Rohtak recorded an earthquake of 4.6 magnitude. There have been several more mild quakes in June.The statement from Wadia Institute said: “The recent events cannot be defined as the ‘foreshocks’. If a big earthquake takes place in a region, all smaller events that occurred in the immediate past at that region are categorised as the foreshocks. Therefore, scientifically all these tremors in the Delhi-NCR can be demarcated as the foreshocks only after a big earthquake takes place immediately.”While a stronger earthquake posing a threat to people and property cannot be ruled out, since earthquakes cannot be predicted by any mechanism, the tremors cannot be described as the signal of a big event. All the quakes recorded in Delhi-NCR are due to the release of energy, which have accumulated as a result of northward movement of the Indian plate and its collision with the Eurasian plate, through the fault or weak zones.There are many weak zones and faults in Delhi-NCR – Delhi-Haridwar ridge, Mahendragarh-Dehradun subsurface fault, Moradabad fault, Sohna fault, great boundary fault, Delhi-Sargodha ridge, Yamuna river lineament and Ganga river lineament, the statement said.Delhi is also vulnerable to quakes because of its proximity to Himalayas. There are many faults, ridges and lineaments transverse to the Himalayan arc. A major earthquake in the Himalayan seismic belt may be a threat to Delhi-NCR, the institute said.The Garhwal Himalaya, lying in the Central Seismic Gap and to the north of Delhi-NCR, experienced the 1991 Uttarkashi earthquake of 6.8 magnitude, the 1999 Chamoli earthquake of 6.6 magnitude and the 2017 Rudraprayag earthquake of 5.7 magnitude.This region is due for a major to great earthquake, and such a scenario can make a pronounced impact on north India and Delhi-NCR, Kalachand Sain, the director of Wadia Institute, explained in the statement.One of the important ways to prevent damage is to delineate active faults and ensure major infrastructure is not built near them. If such infrastructure is built, it will have to be done according to the guiding principles of the Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS).The outcome of recent micro-zonation studies for Delhi-NCR by IMD should be considered for construction projects.“The only solution to minimise the loss of lives and properties is the effective preparedness against the earthquake. Countries like Japan have proved this, where earthquakes are common phenomenon, yet the losses are negligible. Annual mock-drill is a regular feature there,” Sain recommended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-ncr-small-magnitude-earthquakes-do-not-indicate-a-bigger-one-is-coming-says-wadia-institute/story-OJ09JR8niGT9mQhLRFeerI.html
19-06-2020||India||In PM Modi’s Ladakh meeting today, AAP and RJD say they aren’t invited||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) have said they did not get an invite to the all-party meeting called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the border face-off between India and China on Friday, their leaders have said.Defence minister Rajnath Singh had on Thursday called and invited all leaders on behalf of the Prime Minister and 20 parties will attend the meeting, according to reports. It will be also attended by Union home minister Amit Shah and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda, they said.AAP leaders Sanjay Singh and Gopal Rai have said their party did not get the call for the meeting.“A strange ego-ridden government is ruling at the Centre. The Aam Aadmi Party has a government in Delhi. It’s the main opposition party in Punjab. There are four MPs all over the country but still the BJP does not want its opinion on such an important matter. The whole country is waiting for what the Prime Minister will say in the meeting,” Sanjay Singh tweeted in Hindi on Thursday.Singh also said all parties should be brought together during a national emergency.Gopal Rai, who is also a minister in the Delhi government, said it is unfortunate that the AAP was not invited.“Instead of taking all the parties together, the BJP is using mathematical formulas to ascertain who should be invited and who should not be. It is unfortunate,” he said.Rai also said the AAP will launch nationwide protests against the Chinese aggression on Saturday and party MLAs will stage protests in their respective constituencies.“To protest the attack on Indian soldiers by China, Aam Aadmi Party will hold ‘Aakrosh Pradarshan’ tomorrow on June 20 at 11:00 am. There will be a demonstration in all the 70 assembly constituencies of Delhi. India will not tolerate the insult of brave soldiers,” Rai tweeted in Hindi.Similarly, the RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav said his party has not been called for the meeting.“The Rashtriya Janata Dal is the largest party in Bihar and it has 5 MPs in Parliament but we have not been invited to today’s all-party meeting on the face-off between India and China We want Rajnath Singh ji to clarify as to why the RJD hasn’t been invited,” Yadav, who is Bihar’s Leader of Opposition, said on Friday, according to ANI.Before that, he had questioned the defence minister and the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) over the miss. “Dear @DefenceMinIndia @PMOIndia, Just wish to know the criteria for inviting political parties for tomorrow’s #AllPartyMeet on #GalwanValley. I mean the grounds of inclusion/exclusion. Because our party @RJDforIndia hasn’t received any message so far,” he had tweeted on Thursday.Reports said all recognised national parties, those with more than five MPs in the Lok Sabha, leading parties from the northeast and parties with Union cabinet ministers have been invited for the all-party meeting.It comes amid demands by the opposition seeking details of the violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh which left 20 Indian Army personnel dead.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-pm-modi-s-ladakh-meeting-today-aap-and-rjd-say-they-aren-t-invited/story-lg72WkacQZykaXnHSzj4bN.html
19-06-2020||India||Rajya Sabha polls: JMM chief Shibu Soren set to enter upper house, advantage BJP on second seat from Jharkhand||Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) chief and former Union minister Shibu Soren is set to enter the Upper House for the second time from Jharkhand, while it’s advantage BJP on the second seat, which is a contest between Jharkhand BJP president Deepak Prakash and Congress’ Shahzada Anwar.Election for the two Rajya Sabha seats of the state is being held on Friday. The voting will end at 4 pm. The polling in the biennials has been necessitated as three candidates are in the fray from Jharkhand.The BJP has nominated its state president Deepak Prakash who was confident of defeating the Congress. “Our win is certain,” he said, adding that with the Congress falling short of required numbers it was playing “dirty politics.”The BJP leadership, however, is cautious, as the party is short of one vote (lawmaker) against the required 27 first preference votes, and has to depend on the AJSU that has two legislators. The BJP has 26 legislators in the House. Despite the assurance of AJSU chief Sudesh Mahto, who after attending the NDA legislature party meet on Wednesday said that the party would vote for the NDA candidate, BJP central leader Om Prakash Mathur called on him once again on Thursday.Another central BJP leader Arun Singh, who was here to overview the party’s poll preparation, met independent MLA Saryu Roy. The latter fell apart with the saffron party before the assembly election, contested against former BJP chief minister Raghubar Das from Jamshedpur (East) assembly seat as rebel candidate and had won.The BJP had put up its legislators in a private university hostel situated on the outskirts of the state capital. The senior party leaders on Thursday trained the new BJP legislators on how to vote in the biennials correctly.The UPA legislators, including chief minister Hemant Soren, also met at a luncheon party thrown by Irfan Ansari on Thursday and discussed their strategy - how to win both the seats.The Congress has fielded Sahazada Anwar. However, the party lags in number (it is short of five votes) and Anwar’s chances depend mostly on cross-voting (if any).There are 79 legislators in Jharkhand assembly after chief minister Hemant Soren had quit the Dumka seat and retained Barhet and the demise of Congress legislator Rajendra Prasad Singh.To win, a candidate thus requires 27 first preference votes. The JMM has 29 MLAs and thus it would be a smooth sail for party president Shibu Soren.The BJP has 26 after Babulal Marandi merged his JVM (P) with it. However, two others - Pradeep Yadav and Bandhu Tirkey who had won the assembly election on JVM (P) ticket did not align with the BJP and joined the Congress. The Election Commission however, accepted them as independent.Besides AJSU, BJP candidate Deepak Prakash has the support of two independent MLAs as well.On the other hand, Congress candidate Shahazada Anwar has 22 votes including two independents, two second preference votes of the JMM, one each of the NCP and CPI (ML) and two independents, besides its own 15 legislators.Senior Congress leader and rural development minister Alamgir Alam said, “The party’s chances will depend if MLAs decide to cross vote. The party is in touch with a few opposition MLAs and independents,” he added.AICC leader PL Punia is in the town as observer to oversee the election management of paty candidate. Here is how the UPA and NDA camps stack up:UPAJMM: 29Cong: 15RJD: 01NCP: 01CPI ML: 01Independents: 02NDABJP: 26AJSU Party: 02Independents: 02||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-polls-jmm-chief-shibu-soren-set-to-enter-upper-house-advantage-bjp-on-second-seat-from-jharkhand/story-iHk2I7zTNmlV79kfnT3XuO.html

He was informed about it and an ambulance was sent to transfer both these patients to a hospital,” said MS Lakshmi Priya, deputy commissioner (DC), Bongaigaon.“When the ambulance reached the quarantine centre, the other person boarded the vehicle. But the man, who had recently returned from Odisha, gave an excuse that he would need to collect some of his stuff from the quarantine centre. He tried to scale a wall of the centre in a bid to escape. Unfortunately, he slipped and sustained severe head injuries,” the DC added.He was immediately shifted to the medical college hospital in neighbouring Barpeta district, where he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). He died on Thursday.“Even though he had tested Covid-19 positive, he didn’t die due to symptoms related to the viral outbreak. His death won’t be counted as a Covid-19 fatality,” the DC said.“This is an unfortunate incident and the deceased would definitely have recovered from the viral disease within a few days. We’ve no idea why he took such an extreme step. We’re taking extra care of all those who are under institutional quarantine in the district,” she added.His last rites were performed at his native village in Bongaigaon district on Thursday, as per the central government’s strict guidelines of disposing of bodies of Covid-19 patients.Bongaigaon district has recorded 65 Covid-19 positive cases until Thursday.Around 7,000 people working in other states have returned to the district in the past 45 days since the ban on inter-state movement was lifted.Assam has recorded 4,862 Covid-19 positive cases till Thursday, including 2,849 patients have recovered and nine deaths.Over 2.91 lakh people have returned to the state from other states in the north-east and the rest of the country since May 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-covid-19-patient-dies-from-head-injuries-while-trying-to-flee-quarantine/story-GX7q6WIacdjEL7g7JMdp5L.html

The Chinese attack in Galwan was pre-planned; 2. GOI was fast asleep and denied the problem; 3. The price was paid by our martyred Jawans,” Gandhi said on Twitter.Also Watch | ‘Govt was fast asleep, soldiers paid the price’: Rahul Gandhi on Ladakh faceoff  It’s now crystal clear that: 1. The Chinese attack in Galwan was pre-planned.2. GOI was fast asleep and denied the problem.3. The price was paid by our martyred Jawans.https://t.co/ZZdk19DHcGHe attached a news report with his tweet in which Union minister Shripad Naik said that the June 15 attack was “pre-planned by China”. He had made the remarks on Wednesday and said that Indian forces will give a befitting reply.Gandhi had attacked the government on Thursday too, asking whether the Indian soldiers were sent to the site of the clash in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley “unarmed”.“China has committed a crime by killing India’s unarmed soldiers. I want to know who sent these unarmed soldiers in the harm’s way and why. Who is responsible?” Gandhi had asked in Hindi during an 18-second video clip posted by him on Twitter.The government said that soldiers involved in the Monday night clash with Chinese troops were carrying weapons and ammunition but did not open fire as they were following border agreements between the two countries.“Let us get the facts straight. All troops on border duty always carry arms, especially when leaving post. Those at Galwan on 15 June did so. Long-standing practice (as per 1996 & 2005 agreements) not to use firearms during faceoffs,” external affairs minister S Jaishankar tweeted, responding to a post by Gandhi.Jaishankar and Gandhi were both reacting to an HT interview with Lt Gen (retired) HS Panag, who said “soldiers do not shoot arms to avoid escalation of the situation”. Panag also said: “The Chinese, by design, came with clubs, with knuckle dusters.”Indian and Chinese soldiers engaged in their first deadly conflict in at least 45 years at Patrol Point 14 in Galwan Valley, resulting in 20 deaths on the Indian side, including that of a commanding officer, and possibly 43 casualties including injuries on the Chinese side during the seven-hour brutal brawl that also involved hand-to-hand fighting.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said on Wednesday that India is a peace loving country but can give befitting reply if provoked. He had made the remarks ahead of a video conference with chief ministers to discuss the Covid-19 situation in the country.Defence minister Rajnath Singh had mourned the death of the 20 soldiers, saying the nation will never forget their supreme sacrifice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/price-paid-by-our-jawans-rahul-gandhi-sharpens-attack-on-govt-on-ladakh-face-off/story-Q6ELuZwHBMTtQpbUYeFuvJ.html
19-06-2020||India||Explainer: What are the Rajya Sabha polls?||In India’s bicameral Parliament – inspired by the British system – the Rajya Sabha or upper house enjoys nearly all the powers of the Lok Sabha or lower house, except that it can’t veto a budget or any money bill.As India’s federal laws need the approval of both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, the upper house – whose members aren’t directly elected by the public – can reject a bill or seek amendments. Also, a legislation introduced in the Rajya Sabha has no shelf life and will remain alive till it has been passed by the House.How the members are elected?While Lok Sabha members are elected directly by voters, the Rajya Sabha members come through a complex process of proportional representation and by votes of the legislators of their respective state. The calculation is: Total number of legislators of the state ÷ no of seats going to polls in the state + 1.Each legislator or MLA will give ranking of candidates according to his or her preference. If a candidate gets the minimum requisite votes, he or she will be elected.But in a contest, if a candidate fails to get the requisite votes from the first preference of the voters, the second preference votes will be counted.How many members are there in Rajya Sabha?The strength of the Rajya Sabha is 245, of whom 233 are elected from the states and union territories. The remaining 12 are nominated by the president. The number of Rajya Sabha MPs from a state depends of the size of its population. Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state, sends 31 MPs to the upper house, while Arunachal Pradesh has just one seat.Who are the nominated members?These members are nominated by the president because of their special knowledge or practical experience in fields such as literature, science, art and social service. Nominated members enjoy the same perks and privileges as that of elected members except on one count – they can’t participate in the election of the president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explainer-all-about-rajya-sabha-polls/story-KXuwGz1Cl1kMGIHcazz5VJ.html

In an official communique, the trust said that the situation at the India-China border is “serious” and defending the country is “most important”.  The decision comes days after a violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley in Ladakh left 20 Indian Army personnel dead. Expressing concern over the killing of Indian soldiers, the trust which has been charged with the construction of the temple after the historic Supreme Court verdict last year, said a new date will be decided soon.  “The decision to begin construction (of temple) will be taken according to the situation in the country and will be announced officially,” Anil Mishra, member of the trust told PTI.The trust also paid tributes to the soldiers. Meanwhile, different Hindu organisations staged protests against China in Ayodhya. While Hindu Mahasabha activists burned the Chinese flag, activists of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) burned the effigy of Chinese President Xi Jinping and smashed Chinese-made products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indo-china-border-standoff-plan-to-start-construction-of-ram-temple-in-ayodhya-suspended/story-G5uPI8iHByt37xLL5bj3rI.html
19-06-2020||India||Battle for 19 Rajya Sabha seats underway: All you need to know||Elections underwayElections to fill 19 vacancies in the Rajya Sabha in nine states are underway. These elections were originally scheduled for March 26, but were deferred after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.Eye on gainsThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is the single largest party in the Rajya Sabha with 75 members out of the current strength of 224, and it is expecting its numbers to go up to 86.Though the BJP will add more seats to its kitty, it won’t reach the halfway mark, which it has been eyeing to help the party get crucial legislation passed in the upper house of Parliament. To be sure, the government didn’t face hurdles in the passage of key bills such as the Reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir and the bill to ban triple talaq, despite not being in a majority.NumbersThe NDA currently has 90 members which includes 75 MPs from the BJP. The Congress has 39 MPs and the opposition bloc together has 69. Parties that are not part of the NDA, but are friendly to the BJP, have 27 MPs.Key contestIn Madhya Pradesh, the BJP is sure of winning two of the three seats – one that of senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia and the other of Sumer Singh Solanki – while the Congress is expecting the return of Digvijaya Singh as its Rajya Sabha member from the state.In Andhra Pradesh, where four seats are up for grabs, the YSRC has fielded AR Reddy, Parimal Nathwani, PS Bose and Venkat Ramana Rao Mopidevi, while TDP has fielded VRV Ramaiah.The contest is interesting in Gujarat, where the Congress saw eight party legislators resigning ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections. The Congress here was confident of winning two seats, but with the resignations, only Shakti Singh Gohil seems to be a sure winner. Its second candidate is Bharat Singh Solanki. The BJP is confident that all its three candidates – Narhari Amin, Abhay Bhardwaj and Ramila ben Bara – will make it to the upper house.In Rajasthan, the Congress and the BJP have been guarding their legislators in resorts to guard against defection. The Congress is confident of winning two of the three seats, and its candidates are KC Venugopal and Neeraj Dangi. The BJP will win one seat and its candidates are OS Lakhawat and Rajendra Gehlot.In Jharkhand, the Congress’ ally, the JMM, is set to win one seat with Shibu Soren as the candidate. There is a fight for the second seat between the Congress and the BJP, which is hopeful of winning one seat with the support of All Jharkhand Students Union and independent candidates. The BJP’s candidate is state party president Deepak Prakash. The Congress has fielded Shahzad Anwar.The BJP is also hopeful of winning one seat each from Mizoram, Meghalaya and Manipur.Voting arrangementsIn the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Election Commission has made stringent arrangements to allow members who are unwell to vote through postal ballot. Members will be provided sanitation and PPE kits if required.How is the voting done?MLAs vote to elect Rajya Sabha members through a proportional representation system with a single transferable vote (STV) system. A ballot has the names of candidates and MLAs have to register their first, second and third preference votes.A candidate with the highest first preference votes wins. As per the rules Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, the single vote is transferable from one nominee to another and that takes place in two contingencies where there would otherwise be wastage of votes. These are when a candidate obtains more than what is required for his/her success and, therefore, has an unnecessary surplus; and when a candidate polls so few votes that he/she has absolutely no chance and therefore the votes nominating him/her are liable to be wasted.Each elector has only one vote, irrespective of the number of seats to be filled. But that single vote is transferable from one candidate to another. The ballot paper bears the names of the candidates, and the elector marks on it his preferences for the candidates with the figures 1,2,3,4 and so on against the names chosen.The returning officer counts the votes. They first count the postal ballot papers, and then opens the ballot boxes.All votes have to be marked using a pen specifically provided by the EC for the purpose of election. Votes marked in ink from any pen other than the one supplied by the EC are invalid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/battle-for-19-rajya-sabha-seats-today-all-you-need-to-know/story-sEYADnnztX99EQU9iidOIN.html

Twenty Indian soldiers, including a colonel, were killed in a seven-hour brawl in Galwan Valley on Monday night.The order for the suits – essentially light-weight riot gear – was placed with a Mumbai-based firm last month after scores of Indian soldiers, including a colonel, were injured in a clash with Chinese troops on the northern bank on Pangong Lake on the night of May 5-6, said one of the two officials cited above.Also Watch: India pays tributes to Galwan valley martyrs Also read: On Ladakh border incident, China official asked 6 questions.

The army has ordered a total of around 2,000 sets of protective suits and batons, he said.The tensions escalated significantly after the brutal clash between Indian and Chinese troops in Galwan Valley on June 15. Both sides suffered casualties. The Chinese soldiers employed the same modus operandi and attacked Indian troops with stones, iron rods and nail-studded clubs.Two retired senior commanders that Hindustan Times spoke to said it was inappropriate to supply riot gear to soldiers as their role was not the same as policemen.The June 15 clash also left 76 Indian soldiers injured, including 18 with serious injuries, officials said.

Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has also cast his vote.The voting also began for the four Rajya Sabha seats in Gujarat. The contest between the Congress and the BJP in Gujarat is likely to go down to wire as none of the two parties have absolute numbers. The BJP has fielded three candidates for four seats, while the Congress has given tickets to two candidates.Watch l Key contests in Rajya Sabha polls: All you need to know Both the parties have expressed hope that all their candidates will win the Rajya Sabha polls. Eight Congress legislators have resigned from the Gujarat assembly since the Rajya Sabha polls were first announced in February, reducing the party’s strength to 65 from 79 in 2017. Nearly 1,000 legislators will vote across these states. Health departments of these states oversaw the preparations for the elections. The Election Commission has also appointed a nodal officer for each state to ensure Covid-19 guidelines are followed.The ruling BJP is set to win two seats in Madhya Pradesh as the Bahujan Samaj Party, Samajwadi Party, which have two and one lawmakers respectively, as well as two of the four independent legislators pledged support to the party on Thursday.

19-06-2020||India||From warning on dexamethasone to HCQ: Latest on Covid-19 treatment, vaccines||More than 8.4 million people have contracted the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and 453,290 have died across the world in nearly six months after it was first reported from China’s Wuhan late last year.Around 10 potential vaccines are now undergoing trials in humans, in the hope that a shot to prevent infection can become available in coming months. And even before any vaccines have been proven to work, several countries have already begun making deals with pharmaceutical companies to order doses.The World Health Organization (WHO) hopes hundreds of millions of doses of coronavirus vaccine can be produced this year and 2 billion doses by the end of 2021, chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said on Thursday.The WHO is drawing up plans to help decide who should get the first doses once a vaccine is approved, she said.Priority would be given to frontline workers such as medics, those who are vulnerable because of age or other illness, and those who work or live in high-transmission settings such as prisons and care homes.Here are all the latest updates you need to know about Covid-19 vaccines:Caution on dexamethasoneDexamethasone, a cheap steroid that can help save the lives of patients with severe Covid-19, should be reserved for serious cases in which it has been shown to provide benefits, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. Mike Ryan, the head of the WHO’s emergencies programme, said the drug should only be used in those serious cases where it has been shown to help.“It is exceptionally important in this case, that the drug is reserved for use in severely ill and critical patients who can benefit from this drug clearly,” Ryan said during a briefing.Trial results announced on Tuesday by researchers in Britain showed dexamethasone, a generic drug used since the 1960s to reduce inflammation in diseases such as arthritis, cut death rates by around a third among the most severely ill coronavirus patients admitted to hospital.The research body involved in the trial was the same one which found evidence that HCQ (Hydroxychloroquine) was not extremely effective on all Covid-19 patients.That makes it the first drug proved to save lives in fighting the disease. However, some doctors were cautious, citing possible side-effects and asking to see more data.Volunteers lining up to be infectedThousands are signing up to take part in a high-stakes experiment willing to deliberately expose themselves to the coronavirus to test a potential vaccine, should researchers decide to proceed.Known as human-challenge studies, these tests can hasten research by placing volunteers in the path of the virus, rather than waiting for accidental exposure.Pascal Soriot, chief executive officer of drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc, said the controversial approach may become necessary at some point as the disease ebbs in some cities, making it harder to evaluate shots in the more conventional way.The company is working with the University of Oxford on one of the most advanced vaccines against the virus.The initiative is organized by 1DaySooner, a group that advocates on behalf of people who want to join challenge studies. The organisation has held discussions with potential partners and vaccine manufacturers in a bid to start production of the virus, said Josh Morrison, one of its founders.More than a quarter of the volunteers are in Brazil, where the coronavirus is spreading fast.Morrison said 1DaySooner has contacted vaccine developers planning final-stage studies there to suggest they consider people on its list for conventional studies, too.Proponents note that the approach was used safely for diseases such as malaria, typhoid, cholera as well as the flu. Some experts are calling for a cautious approach.Caution towards polio vaccine for Covid-19Indian scientists have responded cautiously to a suggestion by global researchers that the oral polio vaccine be tested for Covid-19 treatment, saying it is a “testable idea” based on a sound scientific concept but may offer only limited protection against the infection.With a vaccine for Covid-19 at least a year away, scientists say repurposing already safe and effective vaccines is the way to go for immediate relief against Covid-19. The repurposed vaccines could include the oral polio vaccine (OPV) and the Bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) used against tuberculosis, both part of the immunisation given to Indian children.It is worth conducting a clinical trial, said Ram Vishwakarma, director of the CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (CSIR-IIIM) in Jammu.A study was published last week by an international team of researchers in the journal Science. The researchers, including Shyamasundaran Kottili and Robert Gallo from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in the US, said the OPV should be tested to see if it might protect people from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.They noted that the vaccine used to prevent poliomyelitis infections has been around since the 1950s, and is found to provide some protection against other viral infections.Hydroxychloroquine won’t stop coronavirus deathsWHO’s top scientist has said it’s now been definitively proven that the cheap malaria drug hydroxychloroquine the drug favoured by President Donald Trump doesn’t work in stopping deaths among people hospitalised with the new coronavirus.But Dr Soumya Swaminathan said there could still be a role for the drug in preventing people from catching Covid-19 in the first place and noted that clinical trials testing hydroxychloroquine’s role in this are ongoing.Swaminathan said in a press briefing on Thursday that there is still a gap in determining whether hydroxychloroquine has a role at all in the prevention or minimising the severity of the illness in early infection or even in preventing it.The UN health agency announced this week that it is suspending the hydroxychloroquine arm of its own trial testing various experimental therapies for Covid-19, referring to previous results from a large UK trial and a separate analysis of the evidence on the drug.The other drugs being tested by WHO, including treatments used in the past for Ebola and AIDS, are still being pursued.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-warning-on-dexamethasone-to-hcq-latest-on-covid-19-vaccines/story-RQgg1glrPIl9SPp9jxShxO.html

19-06-2020||India||Galwan Valley face off is a crisis that needs a calibrated response: BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) believes the mounting tension at the border with China is due to Beijing growing restive over New Delhi’s “emergent economy” and its “strategic assertion on Arunachal Pradesh”, party functionaries aware of details said on Friday. The party said the violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in Galwan Valley on Monday night, which resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers, is a crisis that needs a “calibrated response and a well thought out reaction”.On Thursday, the BJP called off all its political programmes for the next two days as a mark of respect for the 20 soldiers killed in action at the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Party president JP Nadda tweeted, “The supreme sacrifice of our brave soldiers while guarding our motherland in Galwan Valley will always be remembered. The nation is indebted to them. I pay homage to the martyrs. BJP has decided to postpone all its political programmes including virtual rallies for next 2 days.”A senior party leader said on condition of anonymity that China’s aggression stemmed from “its growing insecurity” about India emerging as an economic rival.“China sees India as a threat to its economic clout. They are also threatened by India asserting its position in Arunachal Pradesh in a more forceful manner. And now post-corona, they feel investors will prefer India over them. So, they have opted for aggression on the border,” said the first functionary. Will the government accept the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh’s demand for revisiting trade ties with China? A second functionary said India’s priority is securing national security and the government will take steps to safeguard Indian interests.On Wednesday, the department of telecommunications (DoT) conveyed to BSNL not to use Chinese-made equipment while upgrading its 4G facilities, and a day later, the Indian Railways’ PSU Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL) announced it will terminate a contract with China’s Beijing National Railway Research and Design Institute of Signal and Communication for signalling work on the Kanpur-Deen Dayal Upadhyay Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor. Affiliates of RSS, the ideological fount of the BJP, are pushing the government to boycott Chinese goods.“The Indian Army is capable of handling Chinese occupation at the borders, but we have to evict their occupation from our markets,” said CK Saji Narayanan, president of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh.Responding to the opposition’s criticism that the government has maintained silence on the issue, a third BJP leader said there has been no compromise on national security.“The opposition is irresponsible in asking the government for knee-jerk reactions. The government is taking its time to issue a statement because of the sensitivity of the problem. Besides, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will chair an all-party meeting on Friday to discuss the situation in the India-China border areas,” the third functionary said.The first functionary added, “The government’s approach to the loss of lives will be based on the cardinal principle of drawing up a befitting response to the attack.”The BJP also denied that deepening strain in the ties with China, Pakistan and Nepal indicates problems in the government’s foreign policy. A muscular foreign policy has been the mainstay of the government’s report card during its first term in office. Even during ongoing digital rallies being addressed by senior BJP leaders to mark the completion of the first year in office during the second term, there have been references to surgical air strikes against terror camps in Pakistan as an example of the government’s undeterred focus on national security.Political analyst Sanjay Kumar of the Centre for Developing Studies said the BJP’s narrative of projecting the crisis as a fallout of China’s insecurity will resonate with the people.“The BJP is very good with its messaging and the prime minister enjoys immense credibility with the man on the street. So if the government says it is not a diplomatic failure but China trying to block India’s entry into the expanded G-10 or rivalling its emerging markets, they will believe it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/galwan-valley-face-off-is-a-crisis-that-needs-a-calibrated-response-bjp/story-oSwkHcAaQWqWDsTUort1dL.html

19-06-2020||India||Negotiating with India on restoring its preferential trade status: US official||The US is mulling over restoring India’s beneficiary status under its trade preference programme Generalized System of Preferences on receiving a counterbalancing proposal from New Delhi, a top Trump ministration official told lawmakers on Thursday. The United States US is currently negotiating with India for it, he added.“We’re in negotiations with India, we took away their GSP, and we’re in the process of restoring it if we can get an adequate counterbalancing proposal from them,” US trade representative Robert Lighthizer told members of the Senate Finance Committee.“Till now, we haven’t done that. But this is something that we’re actually actively negotiating right now,” Lighthizer said, responding to a question from Senator Maria Cantwell from the Washington State.Senator Cantwell expressed disappointment over high import tariffs on apples from her State to India.“India has a 70 percent tariff on apples, so obviously a big product in the State of Washington. What can we do to get those tariffs off from apples in India?” she asked.“We, of course, agree with you and we agree that -- that their regular tariffs are bad, their retaliatory tariffs are even worse,” Lighthizer said.The top trade official from the Trump Administration said the US is currently in a big trade negotiations with India.“We have a big negotiation with India which I’m sure you’re aware of and potentially even moving to an FTA at some point if we can ever make any headway, and that’s Asia.“We have a lot of ongoing discussions. We call them TIFAs, trade and investment discussion forums or negotiating forums with most of the countries throughout that area,” he said.Senator Steve Daines from Montana expressed his concerns over high import tariffs on pulses by India, which is the largest consumer of pulses and an important market for Montana farmers.“Unfortunately, US pulses face high tariffs and an unfair playing field in India,” Daines said.Early this year, he and Senator Kevin Cramer from North Dakota submitted a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to prioritise the issue and raise it directly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “In fact, I was pleased to see the president, President Trump, hand deliver that letter to Prime Minister Modi. In fact, he sent a picture back handing that specific letter to the prime minister and wanted to make sure that we saw it,” Daines said.The Montana senator asked about the status of negotiations with India. “Will you commit to working to remove these tariffs in any ongoing negotiations?” he asked.Lighthizer said, “Yes.” “The MFN tariffs that India has are extremely high on pulses and on just about everything else. One of the indictments I have of the WTO is the fact that we find ourselves in this position. When India joined the GATT, then the GATT, in like 1948, they had a GDP of maybe USD250 billion. Now they’re almost USD3 trillion and they still have a third of their lines of tariffs not bound at all and a whole bunch of them bound at 100 percent,” Lighthizer said.And there’s nothing that the US can do about that, he told the Senators.“How do we change that? The notion that we’re locked into a WTO that says just forever you’re stuck with that imbalance is, to me, crazy. And we have to do something about it,” he said.Lighthizer said negotiations with India are clearly taking longer than he expected.“They are dogged and insistent on keeping their tariffs and we’re dogged in insisting that we’re going to get a fair deal. So, we’re still working on it very much. And hopefully we’ll get to a good outcome,” Lighthizer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-mulls-over-restoring-india-s-preferential-trade-status-top-official/story-DV4J3NitzDhKWg2qsRpo6K.html

19-06-2020||India||18 soldiers injured in Galwan Valley face-off stable: Latest developments||The tension along the contested areas of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) has been continuing despite several rounds of meeting between Indian and Chinese officials.A meeting was held on Thursday to defuse the situation after the skirmish at Galwan Valley on June 15 in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. This was the seventh meeting since the stand-off began in May and third since the Monday night clash.Here are the latest developments in the India-China border stand-off:• India on Thursday asked China to restrict its activities to its side of the Line of Actual Control - a significant move following external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s assertion during a phone conversation with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Wednesday, that Chinese troops entered the Indian side in Galwan Valley and sought to erect a structure.• The Indian Army has said that no soldier was “missing in action” after the violent brawl of June 15, in which the Chinese side also purportedly suffered casualties. “It is clarified that there are no Indian troops missing in action,” the army said in a terse statement, responding to reports that some troops were unaccounted for after the seven-hour clash that involved more than 500 rival troops.• The brawl left 76 Indian soldiers injured, including 18 with serious injuries who are now said to be stable. News agency PTI reported that 18 personnel are undergoing treatment at a hospital in Leh while 58 are admitted to various other hospitals.• India has rubbished Chinese claims of sovereignty over Galwan Valley where the incident took place.• Late on Thursday, people aware of the development indicated that 10 soldiers, including two officers, were released by the Chinese side. Official word on this development was awaited.• Indian and Chinese delegations, led by major generals, met on Thursday near Patrol Point 14 in Galwan Valley as part of military engagements to defuse tensions on the disputed border. “The two sides had a long discussion on the border situation after the clash. They agreed to hold more talks in the coming days. These talks will be held at different levels,” an Indian Army official said on condition of anonymity.• Thousands attended funerals on Thursday for many of the 20 Indian soldiers killed in the clash.• The two armies were engaged in a standoff in Galwan and several other areas of eastern Ladakh since May 5 when the two sides clashed on the banks of the Pangong Tso.• The trigger for the face-off was China’s stiff opposition to India laying a key road around the Pangong Tso Lake besides construction of another road connecting the Darbuk-Shayok-Daulat Beg Oldie road in Galwan Valley. India has already decided not to stall any border infrastructure projects in eastern Ladakh despite Chinese protests.• The last time the Chinese military had taken Indian soldiers captive was in July 1962 after a clash in Galwan Valley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/18-soldiers-injured-in-galwan-valley-face-off-stable-latest-developments/story-6NZKAhn8eJpShbGhU4x9cJ.html
19-06-2020||India||Solar eclipse in times of Covid-19: No gathering allowed, holy dip to be banned in Kurukshetra||India will witness the annular solar eclipse on Sunday (June 21). The Ministry of Earth Sciences has said that the celestial event will be visible in Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttarakhand.A solar eclipse occurs on a new moon day when it comes in between the earth and the sun and all the three objects are aligned.An annular solar eclipse occurs when the angular diameter of the moon falls short of that of the sun and it fails to cover up the latter completely. As a result a ring of the sun’s disk remains visible around the moon.The sky gazers will get an opportunity to observe the “ring of fire” during the phenomenon.Few prominent places within this narrow annularity path are Dehradun, Kurukshetra, Chamoli, Joshimath, Sirsa and Suratgarh.The full solar eclipse will begin at 10:12 am and the phase of annularity will end at 11:50 am. The entire event, however, will end after 2 pm.But this year, the coronavirus pandemic is set to affect the event. At Kurukshetra, one of the places where the eclipse will be visible, the administration has decided to impose prohibitory orders from Friday. The provision bans the assembly of more than four persons.District Magistrate Dhirendra Khadgata said the decision has been taken to ban the holding of the solar eclipse fair in the city as well as within one km of holy tanks at Pehowa and other religious places in Kurukshetra district.He said that steps are being taken to ensure that no one takes a dip at Kurukshetra’s Brahma Sarovar and Sannehit Sarovar during the solar eclipse in view of coronavirus outbreak.Violators would be charged under Section 188 of IPC (disobedience to order duly promulgated by the public servant).Police have started setting up barricades and increased ‘check points’ on the approaching roads to Kurukshetra to stop any vehicular traffic from June 19 night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/solar-eclipse-in-times-of-covid-19-no-gathering-allowed-holy-dip-to-be-banned-in-kurukshetra/story-mfdxOzW3jwrvbPxMBqY1rN.html
19-06-2020||India||Covid-19 may infect respiratory centre of brain, suggests research||A team of researchers at CSIR - Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (IICB), Kolkata has explored the neuro-invasive potential of Covid-19 and suggested that the virus may infect the respiratory centre of the brain, a statement said.The researchers have also suggested that attention should be focused on the respiratory centre of the central nervous system to learn about mortality due to coronavirus.The paper published in ACS Chemical Neuroscience and supported by Science & Engineering Research Board (SERB), a statutory body of the Department of Science & Technology (DST), implies that coronavirus could enter the human brain through the nose and reach the olfactory bulb of the brain.  From there, the virus might infect PreBotzinger complex (PBC), the primary centre of the brain that controls the respiratory rhythm generation. This explains that collapse of the respiratory centre in the brain may be responsible for breakdown of Covid-19 patients.The team of researchers comprising Dr. Prem Tripathi, Dr. Upasana Ray, Dr. Amit Srivastava and Dr. Sonu Gandhi suggested that while the lung is one of the most infected organs, several other organs, including the brain, are also affected by Covid-19. This is the first report that highlights that SARS-CoV-2 may target the PBC of the brainstem that controls respiration and causes respiratory collapse of Covid-19 patients, the statement added.The scientists have suggested that cerebrospinal fluid of Covid-19 patients and postmortem of the brain of the deceased should be assessed to better understand the route of SARS-CoV-2 entry and its spread to the respiratory centre of the brain.The PreBotzinger complex functions as the primary respiratory oscillator and it has been proposed as a centre of respiration. It has been earlier shown that disruption of PBC causes lethality due to respiratory failure, suggesting its central role in respiratory rhythm generation. “It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 may shut down respiratory centre, and in turn breathing by infecting and destroying the PBC of the brainstem,” it said, adding that this hypothesis needs to be validated for SARS-CoV-2.Another recent study from a group of scientists at King’s College London, UK highlighting that loss of smell was one of main symptoms of Covid-19 patients, hinting at the involvement of the same route through which coronavirus may enter the brain.The study highlights that it is important to not only screen the Covid-19 patients for neurological symptoms but also further segregate when the symptom appears. The researchers have pointed out that while at present, the brain is not considered as the site of primary or secondary reason for death of a Covid-19 patient, attention needs to be focused towards the brain’s respiratory centre. “Postmortem of brain of COVID-19 patients could be assessed to know the route of entry and affected areas including detailed assessment of respiratory centre of the brain,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-may-infect-respiratory-centre-of-brain-suggests-research/story-HnqKDAmEEmLh3pquLdTDaM.html

Pakistan raised the Kashmir issue on the forum.“They always rake up bilateral issues in multilateral forum. In fact, they have made it almost a standard norm for their policy. Our foreign policy has a much broader canvas. We have a much wider and global focus,” Swarup said.India was elected unopposed as a non-permanent member of the powerful UN Security Council on Wednesday for a two-year term.India, the endorsed candidate from the Asia-Pacific States, won 184 votes out of the 192 ballots cast in the elections for the five non-permanent seats of the Security Council.Swarup has said that India’s election as a non-permanent member of the Security Council demonstrated the goodwill that New Delhi enjoys at the global body and the confidence the international community has reposed in the country’s capability to contribute to the work of the council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seen-such-behaviour-since-past-many-years-mea-on-pak-not-felicitating-india-s-unopposed-win-at-unsc/story-HbAYh1bXVWgGmny79o1ghP.html
19-06-2020||India||200,000 recuperate, rate of recovery from Covid-19 stands at 54%||The number of patients who recovered from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India crossed 200,000 on Thursday but the country’s recovery rate still trailed the global average.Of the 381,010 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in India, 205,092 recovered as of Thursday, according to data collated by HT. The global recovery rate stood at around 55% while that in India was around 53.8%.Maharashtra, which has roughly a third of all infections in India, logged the highest number of absolute recoveries at 60,838. It was followed by Tamil Nadu at 28,641 and Delhi at 21,341.In terms of recovery rate — which is the ratio of the number of patients recovered to the number of patients infected — among major states, Rajasthan topped the list with 77.5%, followed by Madhya Pradesh at 75.5%. “India’s recovery rate has been steadily going up, which is a good news. More than 50% of those having tested positive have recovered and taken out of active medical supervision,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry, last week.A section of experts said the increasing number of recoveries was a good sign.“When the number of those infected in a day is the same as number of people recovering then it usually highlights the fact that the disease outbreak is going to stabilize and start declining in some time, unless some other variables come in such as floating population, new births etc. that change the entire dynamics,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, professor and head, community medicine department, Safdarjung Hospital.But other experts said it was important to find out how many of the severely ill patients had recovered.“Earlier all positive patients, even those with mild symptoms, were being treated in a hospital, so 50% recovery right now wouldn’t mean much. Now that hospital admissions are being restricted and largely serious patients are being kept in a hospital it remains to be seen what is the recovery rate based on that the real picture will emerge,” said Dr Charu Hans, former head, microbiology department, New Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/200-000-recuperate-rate-of-recovery-stands-at-54/story-Dd8LAlqMtiU2g6eWPuibmL.html

Police have found her and during interrogation, Chepa said she was suffering from fever, cold and cough following which her colleagues asked her to leave the group suspecting coronavirus,” said Bastar’s Inspector General of Police, Sunderaj P.The IGP said that Chepa was an active member of the Maoists’ PLGA battalion No. 1, which is headed by Madvi Hidma. She has been with the CPI (Maoist) for a decade.“She was inducted in 2010 and was working with Hidma and hence she is very important for us,” said Sunderaj.The IGP said that Chepa also claimed that several cadres were suffering from fever and cold and most of them were being asked to leave the camps.“We have sent her in quarantine and her sample will be sent for a coronavirus test,” the officer said. Police have also appealed to villagers in the area to inform them if any Maoist return to their village due to similar reasons so that their health examination can be done and preventive measures to contain the spread of the virus can be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-in-chhattisgarh-pack-off-woman-cadre-suspecting-she-has-covid-19/story-hAGdPSmIj7cJs1hre42a7N.html
19-06-2020||India||456 test positive for Covid-19 on first day of new rapid antigen tests||Four hundred and fifty-six people were found infected with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the national capital in a new testing programme involving quick-result kits across containment zones, where 7,040 samples were collected on Thursday.The tests were carried out through new “antigen” test devices that can be used on-site, and Thursday’s rapid sampling numbers are close to the 8,700-odd RT-PCR tests carried out by labs across the city on Wednesday, underscoring how such kits can ultimately speed up the test-trace-isolate process that health experts across the world see as crucial to containing the pandemic.Officially, the city added 2,877 new cases on Thursday, according to the government’s daily health bulletin, that showed that there had been 65 new fatalities. The new infections came from 8,729 RT-PCR tests, resulting in a confirmation rate of 3.3%. The results from the antigen test results were not included in the bulletin.Rapid antigen testing was done at 193 centres in Delhi on Thursday. A total of 7,040 people were tested of whom 456 tested positive for the infection. At the beginning, those people are being tested whose houses are in the containment zones,” tweeted acting health minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday.The new programme is part of the Union and state government’s effort to ramp up the number of tests in Delhi by six times by the end of this week. The city administration has asked district teams to test those who live in the 242 containment zones in Delhi and are willing to be tested. The new test, developed by a South Korean company and manufactured in Manesar, is highly specific (99.3% to 100%) -- meaning a positive result on the test is a “true positive” and does not need any confirmatory test. The sensitivity is between 50.6% to 84% depending on the viral load, meaning those who test negative might still have the infection and are advised to go for a test through the more reliable RT-PCR method if they show symptoms of the disease.The tests began on a day the government announced that lab tests will be capped at Rs 2,400, a day after it was suggested by a committee formed by the Union government. “Two important decisions have been taken in connection with Covid-19 testing in Delhi: The rate for testing has been reduced to Rs 2,400 and from today, rapid antigen testing has begun by which results will be available in 15 minutes,” said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a tweet, adding that he hoped the decisions will address problems faced by the people.Apart from being quicker than lab-based RT-PCR tests, antigen tests are cheaper – one kit costs Rs 450 – and differ in technology as they look for specific protein associated with the Sars-Cov-2 virus, the pathogen that causes Covid-19. The lab tests look for the exact nucleic signatures of the virus. A third mechanism that can give quick results is the antibody test that checks for the presence of disease-fighting antibodies in a person’s blood, but these have proven to be unreliable and scientists are not sure when and for how long the antibodies can be detected. When antibody tests were rolled out on April 21, only 62 people were tested in one district on the first day. The test was discontinued from the following day after several states reported wide variation in results from the China-sourced kits.“This is certainly a good way of ramping up testing – these tests are cheaper and faster. And at the community level, the test will enable us to identify more cases of Covid-19, they can then be asked to remain in isolation at home preventing further spread of the infection,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital. “The test is not very sensitive, meaning it can give false negative reports. If it’s a false positive, all we would be doing is keeping more people in isolation. Since there is a chance of false negatives with this test, it will have to be reconfirmed. Having said that, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test is also about 67% and not very different from this test,” he added.On Thursday, people in containment zones began reaching the testing facilities – set up mostly in neighbourhood government schools, dispensaries and mohalla clinics – where they were seated at 1m distance before they were administered the test. At the Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Naraina in west Delhi, around 50 people gathered after community volunteers reached out and persuaded people living in a nearby containment area to come to get diagnosed. Four people in a full-body suit in an air-conditioned room called people one by one. One paramedic collected naso-pharyngeal swabs, before a second one took it and inserted into a tube. This process is meant to inactivate the virus, and dissolve it in a solution that was then put on the main test strip that would give the final result. A third person numbered the antigen kits with a permanent marker and wrote down the name of the tested person along with the kit number on another sheet. The fourth entered this data to an online portal.“There were teething troubles on Thursday, with a lot of the time being wasted on setting up the centres. It will be streamlined in a couple of days,” said a district-level health official, asking not to be named. “The antigen testing is very beneficial for district teams as we get a result immediately and ask people to remain in quarantine if they have the infection. This prevents further spread. It also ensures that people who do need to be admitted to hospitals, reach there in a timely manner,” this person added. Apart from the containment zones, the antigen tests are likely to be rolled out in Delhi’s hospitals within a couple of days. In a hospital setting, the ICMR recommends the test be used for those who develop influenza-like symptoms, are immune-compromised because of an existing condition, or are undergoing procedures such as chemotherapy and dialysis. “We have already ordered the tests and should get it within a couple of days. Once that happens, we will start testing patients who fit the ICMR criteria with the antigen kits. Those who test negative will be tested using RT-PCR. In the absence of the antigen test, we would have had to test all the people using RT-PCR, which is time and resource-intensive,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent of AIIMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/456-covid-19-on-first-dayin-new-rapid-antigen-tests/story-Bkrro1afOtJJVDidUniyTP.html
19-06-2020||India||India tells China to stick to its side, says no soldier missing||India on Thursday asked China to restrict its activities to its side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) while rubbishing Chinese claims of sovereignty over Galwan Valley, even as the Indian Army said that no soldier was “missing in action” after the violent brawl of June 15.Indian and Chinese delegations, led by major generals, met on Thursday near Patrol Point 14 in Galwan Valley as part of military engagements to defuse tensions on the disputed border. This was the seventh meeting between Major General Abhijit Bapat, commander of Karu-based headquarters 3 Infantry Division, and his Chinese counterpart since the stand-off began in early May, and the third after Monday night’s clash that left 20 Indian soldiers dead.“The two sides had a long discussion on the border situation after the clash. They agreed to hold more talks in the coming days. These talks will be held at different levels,” an Indian Army official said on condition of anonymity.Amid the continuing contacts via military and diplomatic channels, India asked the Chinese side to limit its activities to its side of the LAC – a significant move following external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s assertion during a phone conversation with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Wednesday, that Chinese troops entered the Indian side in Galwan Valley and sought to erect a structure.“Given its responsible approach to border management, India is very clear that all its activities are always within the Indian side of the LAC. We expect the Chinese side to also confine its activities to its side of the LAC,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly media briefing.Earlier in the day, Srivastava dismissed the Chinese military’s claim of sovereignty over Galwan Valley, which is at the heart of the stand-off. He pointed to the June 6 agreement reached at a meeting of senior military commanders for de-escalation and disengagement along the LAC, and said: “Making exaggerated and untenable claims is contrary to this understanding.”After the clash of June 15, a statement in Mandarin issued by the Western Command of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) said: “The sovereignty of the Galwan River Valley has always been ours.”The Indian Army also asserted that no soldiers were missing in action after the June 15 brawl in Galwan Valley, in which the Chinese side also purportedly suffered casualties.“It is clarified that there are no Indian troops missing in action,” the army said in a terse statement, responding to reports that some troops were unaccounted for after the seven-hour clash that involved more than 500 rival troops.The June 15 clash marked the first Indian casualties in a border skirmish with PLA since October 1975, when Chinese troops ambushed an Indian patrol in Arunachal Pradesh’s Tulung La sector and shot four soldiers dead.The soldiers exchanged blows, threw stones at each other, and Chinese troops attacked Indian soldiers with iron rods and nail-studded clubs. Some soldiers from both sides fell into the river and their bodies were retrieved on Tuesday morning, Indian Army officials said on condition of anonymity.The brawl left 76 Indian soldiers injured, including 18 with serious injuries who are now said to be stable. Indian Army officials claimed 43 Chinese were killed or seriously injured, citing radio intercepts and other intelligence. Fatal casualties on the Chinese side reportedly include a colonel, but HT could not independently verify this.The external affairs ministry said India had expected de-escalation and disengagement along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh to “unfold smoothly” after senior military commanders of both sides reached a consensus on these efforts during the meeting in Chushul-Moldo region on June 6.External affairs ministry spokesperson Srivastava reiterated India’s assertion the Chinese side was to blame for the violence as it “departed from the consensus to respect the LAC in Galwan Valley”. The violent face-off of June 15, he said, occurred “when the Chinese side unilaterally attempted to change the status quo there” and took “premeditated and planned action that was directly responsible for the resulting violence and casualties suffered by both sides”. He added: “This could have been avoided had the agreement at the higher level been scrupulously followed by the Chinese side.”Srivastava said that during his phone conversation with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on Wednesday, Jaishankar “conveyed that the need of the hour was for the Chinese side to reassess its actions and take corrective steps”. He added: “They should strictly respect and observe the LAC and not take any unilateral action to alter it. It was agreed that both sides would implement the dis-engagement understanding of June 6 sincerely. Neither side would take any action to escalate matters and instead, ensure peace and tranquillity as per bilateral agreements and protocols.”The two sides are in regular touch through their embassies and foreign offices, and have maintained communication at the military commanders’ level on the ground. Meetings of other established diplomatic mechanisms such as the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs are being discussed, Srivastava said.“While we remain firmly convinced of the need for maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the borders areas and the resolution of differences through dialogue, at the same time, as [Prime Minister Narendra Modi] stated [on Wednesday], we are also strongly committed to ensuring India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Srivastava added.Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said: “We aren’t out of the woods as yet. The foreign ministers of the two sides had a candid conversation and the crux of the matter was outlined in India’s readout – that the consensus reached on June 6 was broken by the Chinese side.” “Things are very fluid and there is trouble at other points of the LAC though we are not focusing on them. We have made our position clear, but whether the Chinese side adheres to the consensus at the diplomatic or military levels remains to be seen. A solution won’t come at the military level, and that’s why the diplomatic and political levels become important,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-tells-china-to-stick-to-its-side-says-no-soldier-missing/story-jtJi1wgbOIoSfdP5ETY8fO.html
19-06-2020||India||India-China stand-off: Galwan skies go quiet, tension simmers on the ground||The stalemate between India and China at four points in Eastern Ladakh continues with the withdrawal of troops by both sides virtually coming to a stop after the June 15 escalation in the Galwan sector.While divisional military commanders from the two sides are in continuous conversation in the Galwan sector, intelligence inputs reveal that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has hardly moved as per the de-escalation matrix laid down by Corps Commanders on the two sides on June 6.It is now evident, experts say, that the resolution of the India-China stand-off at patrolling point 14 (Galwan), patrolling point 15 (Kongka La) and patrolling point 17 (hot springs) may take weeks of intensive deliberations. The stand-off at Pangong Tso will take even more time.There were, however, some positive indicators in Eastern Ladakh with the Chinese PLA Air Force not undertaking any night fighter operations on Thursday and the two armies scrupulously obeying the rules of engagement. The strict adherence to laid down military protocols by the two armies has also reduced chances of any vertical escalation.Even though the situation is stable after the violent scrap of June 15, the Chinese PLA is fully deployed in Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) with air, artillery and missile support. The PLA Air Force has activated its bases in both Xinjiang and TAR with fighter aircraft making a show of strength in Aksai Chin area in the night. The basic idea is to pressure Indian military to back off in Eastern Ladakh.Also read: India tells China to stick to its side, says no soldier missingWhile a section of the Indian military establishment was elated after the two generals worked out the June 6 dis-engagement process, Indian diplomats and intelligence operatives said it was imperative that this be translated on the ground. It was quite evident to both, people familiar with the matter said, that China was not showing any signs of intent of withdrawing from the stand-off without achieving its political objectives. The Chinese military build-up and aggressive intention of the PLA was evident after surface-to-air missile batteries and armed drones were moved to Aksai Chin after Indian Su-30 MKIs made a sortie near Pangong Tso in early May after the skirmish at the salt water lake. The movement of large numbers of armoured personnel carriers and heavy calibre guns made the Indian national security establishment uneasy about the military intentions of its northern Asian neighbour. It was only because of this alertness that Indian Army was able to foil PLA’s Galwan game plan to capture the entire river valley and make the Darbuk Shyok Daulet Beg Oldi road at the confluence of Galwan-Shyok come under the intense gaze of the Chinese artillery.Also read: Behind Galwan’s bloody face-off, China’s plan to interdict gateway to KarakoramWhile Indian forces are fully deployed along the 3,488km Line of Actual Control to blunt any Chinese PLA offensive, experts said conversations between military commanders must yield result soon or else the possibility of a military accident cannot be ruled out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/withdrawal-of-troops-on-hold-since-june-15/story-wkD4e4OxkFoPNGHAn5c01N.html
19-06-2020||India||‘Intrusion can’t be compared to Kargil, unless it escalates’: General VP Malik||Chandigarh: Former chief of army staff General Ved Prakash Malik, who was the helm during the Kargil war, spoke to Ramesh Vinayak about the military escalation on the Line of Actual control that led to the killing of 20 Indian soldiers in the deadliest border clash in last four-and-a-half decades between with China, the fallout of the escalation. Edited excerpts of an email interview: What is your reading of the deadly clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers in Ladakh? What makes this an extraordinary escalation?Two facts stand out from the present face-off: the People Liberation Army (PLA) encroachment across the LAC in Galwan Valley and in the disputed area of Fingers, North of Pangong Tso, has been a well-planned military activity; and military-level dialogue and understanding on the LAC has no sanctity for PLA. This military action has eroded whatever confidence was created with China at the military level, and trust at diplomatic and political levels.From the defence standpoint, what are the most crucial consequences?Despite several agreements and protocols, special representative-level talks and political summits to maintain peace and tranquillity along the LAC, the number of PLA attempts to encroach upon undisputed and disputed territories have increased. The level of violence -- from scuffles to stone pelting and the use of nails-embedded wooden clubs to kill opponent soldiers -- has increased. I foresee larger deployment of troops on both sides along the LAC to ensure security of our territory and assets. This will also require urgent improvement of military infrastructure to sustain troops deployed.What do you see as the tactical and strategic objectives of China’s multiple and in-depth transgressions and holding areas that India has so far seen as its side of the LAC?China under President Xi Jinping is committed to retake all territories it perceives to have belonged to China in the past. Its attempts to execute salami slicing or creeping encroachments avoiding major escalation will continue. We can expect more such military level activities, particularly in Ladakh, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.Do you think our military response on the ground was adequate and effective enough to countervail the Chinese intrusion?As per past practices in the Demchok, Depsang, Chumar areas in Ladakh and in Doklam, the effort at military and diplomatic levels was to defuse and disengage. This has been the government’s policy and the usual response to maintain peace and tranquillity and avoid violent escalation. The army has gone as per those policy guidelines. These guidelines may change hereafter.What options does India have for the restoration of status quo ante in the region and to counter China while keeping its aggression below the threshold of actual conflict?While the armed forces have to be prepared for any military escalation, it is for the Cabinet Committee on Security to consider wider geopolitical and strategic aspects and then give further directions. I think the government will now explore diplomatic and political level possibilities to get the encroachments vacated before going in for escalation.Is a localised military response still one of the options?Any military-level dialogue at this stage is unlikely to produce desired results. It has to be tackled at the diplomatic and political levels now. However, with prevailing tension and anger among troops who are in an eyeball to eyeball situation, a violent escalation cannot be ruled out. The armed forces have to remain extra alert for any military action.What, in your assessment, are the chances of the situation flaring up along the LAC?I do not expect the situation will develop into a full-fledged war or even major skirmishes along the length of our border. It is likely to remain localised. That, however, does not mean that we should become complacent militarily or politically. Amid heightened antagonism and mistrust between India and China, what will be the most important geostrategic consequences of a tense LAC for India vis-à-vis Pakistan? Pakistan may attempt to intensify its sponsored terrorist activities in J&K, and ceasefire violations along the LoC (Line of Control) and AGPL (Actual Ground Position Line). India has the capability to handle any such escalations.Why it is crucial to resolve or freeze the border dispute with China? The border dispute must be resolved peacefully or frozen till both nations can find a peaceful solution. That way both nations will be able to contribute towards peace, tranquillity and prosperity of Asia and also improve the quality of life of their people.Is a two-front scenario now more real than ever before?Unless the border dispute is resolved peacefully, such a possibility in the north-west part of India cannot be ruled out in the middle distant horizon.Do you see any parallel between Pakistan’s intrusion of Kargil in 1999 and China’s intrusion in Ladakh?No. The Pakistani military and political objectives in Kargil were much larger. It became a limited war situation. The present Chinese intrusion in Ladakh, unless it escalates further, cannot be compared to Kargil conflict. Given the complexity and high-level bilateral and multilateral interaction (including security) between India and China, the stakes in any India-China conflict, whether large-scale or limited, will be much higher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/intrusion-can-t-be-compared-to-kargil-unless-it-escalates-general-ved-prakash-malik/story-lAHOBX6QJjXKFQmWqV9InM.html
19-06-2020||India||Families pay final tributes as bravehearts laid to rest||Jamshedpur/Kolkata/Bhopal: When Ganesh Handsa, 22, returned home in Jharkhand’s West Singhbhum in February for a holiday, he promised to help his family build a two-brick room house for them. Handsa, who was among the soldiers killed in the violent face-off with Chinese troops in Ladakh on Monday, was the sole bread-earner for the improvised family that lives in a two-room thatched mud house. Six of the 20 soldiers killed in Ladakh were from the country’s most backward and poorest parts in West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh. The villages of some of them do not have even basic facilities like piped drinking water and proper connectivity. Ganesh Handsa’s brother, Dinesh, said the local administration overnight built a road to bring his body and installed street lights in their Bandhdih Tollah village, which does not have a proper drinking water source. Paresh Munda, a village council member, said Bandhdih Tollah is one of the most backward areas of the tribal-dominated district, where women still walk long distances to fetch water.Villagers said the road construction was going at a slow pace after starting under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, which employs Dinesh, about a year ago. They added the authorities on Wednesday swung into action and built the remaining part of the road to Ganesh Handsa’s house, which is about two km from the closest national highway. Three street lights were also installed as political leaders, district officials and journalists visited the Hansdas. “My brother’s death has ensured that our village now has a road,” Dinesh Handsa said. But he added Ganesh Handsa’s dream of building a concrete house for the family of six remains unfulfilled. “When he came in February, he promised to send money to build two brick rooms for us. With him, the dream is also gone,” Dinesh Handsa said.Around 500 km away, the family of another soldier, Rajesh Orang, 26, killed in Ladakh, lives in a single-storey house, a part of which is old with a thatched roof in West Bengal’s Birbhum district. “The old house needs restoration. I do not know whether the family without their only earning member will be able to repair their home now,” said Ritesh Orang, a relative of the soldier.He said that the only source of drinking water for close to 200 families in the village is a handpump and a narrow lane connects it to the main road about five km away. “So, the body could be brought only to the main road from where people carried it to the village,” Orang said. Ruling Trinamool Congress legislator and agriculture minister Asish Banerjee visited Orang’s home on Thursday morning and assured all the help to the family. The village of Bipul Roy, 26, another soldier killed in Ladakh, in West Bengal’s Alipurduar district has electricity but no concrete road. During the monsoon, people have to take a kilometer-long muddy road to reach the village, said Taranikanta Das, Roy’s brother-in-law. He said Roy’s father is a farmer and the family lives in a house made of mud, bricks and tin. “Bipul said he was saving money to build a proper brick house for five or six years,” he said. The construction of a road to sepoy Deepak Kumar’s Farenda village in Madhya Pradesh was announced in 2017. “Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has directed officials to complete the road fast,” said Ashish Singh, a resident of the village, who attended Kumar’s funeral. “We will name the road after Deepak,” he said. Residents said their major concern is the lack of health facilities. “There is a health centre but no doctor. Villagers take medicines from the lone chemist in the village,” said Rakesh Singh, another villager. Kurretola in Chhattisgarh’s Kanker district, where sepoy Ganesh Ram Kunjam was from, got a road under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana last year. His friend Surya Nevendra said Kunjam was able to build a concrete house last year. It is the only such house in this tribal village, said his uncle Tiharu Ram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/families-pay-final-tributes-as-bravehearts-laid-to-rest/story-hkArC1WUoCF4x2drsbwSGI.html
19-06-2020||India||Positivity rate rises nationwide, pointing to faster spread of Covid-19||The average rate of samples testing positive for Covid-19 across the country has risen from 4.6% for the week ending May 17 to 7.8% for the week ending June 17, but the rise has been alarming in states such as Delhi and Haryana — a trend experts said is suggestive of an expanding outbreak.In Delhi, the figure has grown from 7% on May 17 to 31.6% on June 17, according to government data analysed by HT. In other words, while seven of every 100 samples were turning out to be positive a month ago, this has risen to 31 of 100 now.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here India does not give out data of individuals tested but of samples tested. This means that people who get tested multiple times are counted every time, so the positivity rate may be higher than what data suggests.More than 6.2 million samples have been tested for Covid-19 in India as of June 17, of which 367,117 cases have been reported, resulting in an overall positivity rate of 5.9% from when testing began in January.The rise of positivity rate, coupled with increasing new cases, suggests that the virus is spreading in the community, experts said.Also read: Covid spreads easily within families, symptomless spread common, says study“An increase in positivity rate is a reflection of the increase in prevalence of the virus in the community,” said T Jacob John, former head, Indian Council for Medical Research’s Centre for Advanced Research in Virology.A rising positivity rate can be heavily influenced by targeted strategies -- such as the one in India, where only those exhibiting symptoms are tested. The downside of this is that large sections of population who are asymptomatic are left out.“We have tested less than 0.5% of the total population in the country; this is a very small number. We can’t assume that the entire infected population is confined to a tiny fraction. The rising positivity rate indicates that infection rate is increasing in the remaining 99.5% and indirectly points to the fact that there is community transmission happening,” John said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Among the 10 worst-hit states, Delhi reported the biggest change in positivity rate (from 7% on May 17 to 31% on June 17), followed by Haryana (1% to 10.1%) and Tamil Nadu (4.2% to 10%). The positivity rate has increased from 16.4% on May 17 to 21.2% on June 17 in Maharashtra, the state with the highest number of cases and deaths. Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, however, are the only states among the 10 worst-hit regions to report a reduced positivity rate -- albeit marginally. In Gujarat, it went from 11.3% to 10.1%, in Rajasthan from 2.2% to 2% and in Madhya Pradesh from 4.3% to 2.8%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/positivity-rate-rises-nationwide-pointing-to-faster-spread-of-covid-19/story-dIMUHNCgmHKjOBHxgjk7XO.html
19-06-2020||India||‘Armed, but followed protocol’: Govt||India said on Thursday that soldiers involved in the June 15 Galwan Valley clash with Chinese troops were carrying weapons and ammunition but did not open fire as they were following border agreements between the two countries -- a remark that came in response to a question from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on whether the Indian soldiers were sent in “unarmed”.Agreements between India and China bar using firearms during face-offs, two senior army officers said, as a political controversy erupted over whether the Indian soldiers were carrying weapons that could have been used to defend themselves.“Let us get the facts straight. All troops on border duty always carry arms, especially when leaving post. Those at Galwan on 15 June did so. Long-standing practice (as per 1996 & 2005 agreements) not to use firearms during faceoffs,” external affairs minister S Jaishankar tweeted, responding to a post by Gandhi.“How dare China kill our UNARMED soldiers? Why were our soldiers sent UNARMED to martyrdom?” Gandhi tweeted earlier in the day. Jaishankar and Gandhi were both reacting to an HT interview with Lt Gen (retired) HS Panag, who said “soldiers do not shoot arms to avoid escalation of the situation”. Panag also said: “The Chinese, by design, came with clubs, with knuckle dusters.” Border agreements from 1996 and 2005 between India and China disallow the use of firearms during face-offs. Article 6 of the agreement on confidence-building measures in the military field along the Line of Actual Control, signed by India and China in November 1996, states that both sides will not open fire or “conduct blast operations or hunt with guns or explosives within two kilometers from the Line of Actual Control”.HT reported on Wednesday and Thursday that forward troops patrolling the disputed border either do not carry guns, or, if they do, keep them slung on their backs with the magazines in pouches and not clipped on. “Things can spiral out of control even if one bullet is fired,” one of the officers quoted above said on condition of anonymity.Indian and Chinese soldiers engaged in their first deadly conflict in at least 45 years at Patrol Point 14 in Galwan Valley, resulting in 20 deaths on the Indian side, including that of a commanding officer, and possibly 43 casualties including injuries on the Chinese side during the seven-hour brutal brawl that also involved hand-to-hand fighting.Rival soldiers exchanged blows, threw stones at each other and Chinese troops even attacked the Indians with rods and nail-studded clubs during the brawl that went on for over seven hours.But some experts were sceptical. The inherent purpose of carrying a weapon is to put it to use in case of an attack like the one in Galwan Valley, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd). “Why do soldiers carry weapons? There are restrictions on using firearms during a face-off that involves banner drills or soldiers pushing each other around. Galwan was different. It was attack on our soldiers,” he said.A former military chief, who also served as the chairman, chiefs of staff committee, suggested it was unlikely for armed soldiers not to fire their rifles on opposing troops while their commanding officer and comrades were being beaten to death. “No soldier will exercise that kind of restraint. The rules of engagement and agreements usually go to hell in such a scenario,” he said. Gandhi, in a brief 18-second video, said that “China committed a grave crime by killing unarmed India soldiers”. He added, “I want to ask, who sent these brave soldiers unarmed in the face of danger? Who is responsible?”Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Sambit Patra hit back at the former Congress president, asking him to “read, understand and then ask questions”. “In November 1996, under the (HD) Deve Gowda-led government India signed an agreement with China that neither side shall open fire, cause biodegradation or cause explosions within 2km of LAC. It was stipulated that weapons shall not be used by either side,” Patra said. The Indian Army is the “most professional” force that sticks to agreements, Patra added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armed-but-followed-protocol-govt/story-fjuuwtLXNsMtAtjPKE5LPJ.html
19-06-2020||India||From infrastructure to hi-tech: Mapping China’s large trade footprint in India||The deadly border skirmishes between India and China have cast a cloud over trade relations, which have seen the latter rapidly expand its footprint in the Indian economy, spanning infrastructure, physical goods and hi-tech, with the value of total bilateral trade surging 20% in the last six years, according to official data. At least some of this surge, experts admit, has come at the cost of local industry. Chinese firms have ploughed huge investments into some of the country’s most iconic tech brands, such as the ride-hailing service Ola, a fintech company Paytm, food-delivery app Zomato and e-commerce platform Flipkart. How large are Chinese investments in India and what do the two countries trade in? Mapping these two variables shows bilateral trade clocked an average double-digit growth in the last three years, and much of it to China’s advantage. Also read| India-China stand-off: Galwan skies go quiet, tension simmers on the groundAccording to data from the commerce ministry, India’s bilateral trade with China was worth nearly $80 billion in 2019. Data posted on India’s Beijing embassy website, which it sourced to China’s customs department, showed total bilateral trade between Jan and Nov 2019 at $84.3 billion, a drop of nearly 3.2% from the previous year’s $ 95.7 billion. China is India’s largest trading partner, but the latter runs a large trade deficit. This means India buys far more goods from China, in value terms, than it sells to that country. Imports from China account for an average 16% of India’s total. On the other hand, in India’s total exports, China’s share is just 3.2%. So, to be sure, the trade imbalance is substantial and works to India’s disadvantage.Despite this, analysts say stakes for China are high in India’s technology sector. In 2019-20, Chinese tech firms invested in India the most, according to data from FDI Intelligence, a global investment advisory firm owned by The Financial Times Ltd. Also read| 18 soldiers injured in Galwan Valley face-off stable: Latest developmentsIn 2019, there were “19 inbound projects, which is more than double the eight projects invested in Russia, the second-highest destination for investment”, according to an April 22 report published by FDI Intelligence. Two-thirds of Indian unicorns -- a label for start-ups valued at $1 billion – have Chinese investment, according to data from the think-tank Gateway House. In 2018, Alibaba invested $216m in online grocer BigBasket. It also invested $210m in food delivery app Zomato. Tencent has $400 million riding on ride-hailing app Ola, besides $700 million in e-commerce platform Flipkart, an investment made in April 2017. This investment set a record of being the highest foreign investment picked up by an India-based tech firm. Alibaba is a large investor also in Paytm, while Tencent has invested in Byju’s, an education start-up. Also read: India tells China to stick to its side, says no soldier missingIndia exports mostly a basket of primary goods to China, including cotton, yarn, organic chemicals, ores, natural pearls, precious stones, and fabrics. Chinese imports into India include electric machinery, electronic equipment, nuclear reactors, boilers, solar energy components and APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients), the backbone of India’s pharma industry.“India is likely to put a lot of things under the scanner now, though I don’t see any overnight impact on goods trade,” said Geethanjali Nataraj, a trade economist with the Indian Institute of Public Administration. Nataraj said a “trust deficit” between the two countries was apparent, referring to Indian commerce ministry’s tightening of foreign investment rules in April. The new rules say any business from a country “which shares land border with India” will need the government’s nod before investing in an Indian firm. “This was to block possibility of opportunistic takeovers from China,” said Biswajit Dhar, a trade expert who teaches at the Jawaharlal University and who previously advised the commerce ministry,According to Dhar, going forward, India will likely reduce overdependence on any one country, including China. “Of most sectors, the health sector’s heavy dependence on Chinese active pharmaceutical ingredients is most crucial. Nearly 90% of our critical therapeutic is import-dependent. One solution is to ramp up our public pharma sector’s capacity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mapping-china-s-large-trade-footprint-in-india/story-3fIpfOfG1BAN6JMRIboKoI.html
19-06-2020||India||Freight body to end contract with Chinese firm||The Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL) is in the process of terminating a contract given to a Chinese firm in 2016 because of delays in the signalling and telecommunication work assigned to it, the railway ministry said on Thursday. The decision to terminate the Beijing National Railway Research & Design Institute of Signal & Communication’s contract was taken in April due to the firm’s “slow progress” in the work, officials said. The ministry’s announcement came three days after 20 Indian soldiers were killed as hundreds of troops from India and China fought with iron rods and clubs studded with nails in Ladakh. India is mulling economic measures, including limiting China’s access to its vast market, in response to the face-off. HT on Thursday reported at least 100 Chinese products are staring at anti-dumping action and future investments from China, including the participation of its firms in big and important projects such as the 5G market, could be barred.A ministry spokesperson maintained the DFCCIL’s decision to terminate the contract was due to the firm’s “very poor performance”. The contract relates to signalling and telecommunication work along the Kanpur-Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction stretch of the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor, which is being built for faster movement of freight across the country’s eastern parts. The World Bank-funded project is worth Rs 471 crore. Also read: 18 soldiers injured in Galwan Valley face-off stable: Latest developments“The contract was awarded in August 2016 and was to be completed within 1,000 days. However, the progress has been very slow and hardly 20% of work has been completed. We decided to terminate it and approached the World Bank to grant us NOC [no objection certificate for it] in April and are hopeful the process will be completed by June end. It is an important project and was being monitored by the PMO [Prime Minister’s Office],” DFCCIL managing director Anurag Sachan said.DFCCIL, a public sector undertaking under the railway ministry, needs the NOC to terminate the contract as per the bank’s project financing regulations. It brought to the bank’s notice the delays in April. “The bank had sought more details on the contract implementation issues. We received most of the information by June 9, 2020, and are currently reviewing the information provided,” a World Bank spokesperson said. In its termination notice, DFCCIL said only 20% of the work had been completed “despite the passage of four years” and added it has decided to terminate the contract in view of the poor progress. (HT has seen a copy of the notice?).DFCCIL said the company was reluctant to furnish the technical documents. “Non-availability of the engineers/authorised personnel was a serious issue,” it said. It added the physical work on the project also could not progress as the firm had no tie-up with the local agencies. “Material procurement, which is an independent activity, has not been done earnestly. There is no improvement in progress despite repeated meetings with them at every possible level.” DFCCIL has been tasked with developing the Golden Quadrilateral for linking Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Howrah. The project seeks to decongest up to 70% freight load of the railways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freight-body-ends-contract-with-chinese-firm/story-bDHqQt4te3380FTqzNKjRP.html
19-06-2020||India||Nepal Houses okay map amendment||The upper house of Nepal’s parliament on Thursday passed a constitutional amendment to give legal backing to a new map that depicts the Kalapani region as Nepalese territory, a move that could exacerbate a border row with India.All 57 voting members of the 59-member National Assembly or upper house voted to endorse the new political map issued last month showing the disputed areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepal. The amendment was passed by 258 votes in the House of Representatives, or lower house, on April 13. Its passage in the upper house was considered a formality as the ruling Nepal Communist Party has a majority, unlike in the lower house. However, even the lower house passed the bill by a two-thirds after it was backed by key opposition parties such as the Nepali Congress and the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. Later, the bill was approved by President Bidya Devi Bhandari. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a media briefing in New Delhi that India had made its position clear on June 13, when an official statement said the “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims by Nepal wasn’t based on historical fact and wasn’t tenable. “We have already made our position clear on this.”On Monday, the Indian side said the onus is on the KP Sharma Oli government in Nepal to create a “positive and conducive atmosphere” for talks to resolve the row over the Kalapani-Lipulekh region. India has repeatedly conveyed its readiness to discuss the issue, with the latest offer for talks between foreign secretaries of the two sides made around the time Nepal tabled the constitutional amendment in Parliament on May 31, people familiar with developments said.The boundary row with Nepal has flared up at an inopportune time for India, which is engaged in a tense border stand-off with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). A violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops on Monday night left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead.The border row erupted last month after India opened an 80km road to Lipulekh on the border with the Tibet Autonomous Region to facilitate pilgrims going to Kailash Mansarovar. Nepal lodged s strong protest and Oli’s government issued a new map that showed Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as Nepalese territory. It then moved the constitutional amendment in Parliament to give legal backing to map.Almost 98% of the 1,750km land and riverine border between India and Nepal has been delineated and differences remain only in the Kalapani sector in Uttarakhand and Susta sector in Bihar. The Indian side has said Nepal’s “shifting” claims are contrary to the Treaty of Sugauli signed in 1815 by Nepal and the British, a ruling by the British governor general in 1817, and Nepal’s boundary treaty with China of 1961 and protocols signed in 1963 and 1979.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-houses-okay-map-amendment/story-PLUTJYsZElFmpFDhilC8rK.html
19-06-2020||India||Coalsector out of years of lockdown, says PM Modi||New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday launched the auction of 41 coal mines for commercial mining and said that the Indian economy was recovering fast amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, expressing confidence in the domestic industry to accomplish the idea of a self-reliant India.At an industry event titled “Unleashing Coal: New Hopes for Atmanirbhar Bharat”, the Prime Minister said he wanted India to be a net exporter of coal – the annual production capacity of the 41 coal mines is nearly a third of the country’s total output.The launch of the auction process not only marks the beginning of the unlocking of the country’s coal sector from the “lockdown of decades”, but aims at making India the largest exporter of coal, the Prime Minister said. The auction marks the opening up of the Indian coal sector to commercial mining. The Union Cabinet approved the new auction process of coal and lignite blocks on revenue-sharing basis last month as part of its strategy to revive economic activity amid the pandemic. The reform was announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on May 16 as part of the economic stimulus package.India is determined to convert adversities into opportunities and the Covid-19 disaster has taught the lesson of becoming self-reliant, Modi said as he spoke about the vision to make the country the largest exporter of goods that are currently imported.The PM said the auction of the coal mines was taking place at a time when business activity in India was recovering fast, with consumption and demand moving rapidly towards pre-Covid levels. “There is no better time to launch this new initiative. Between end of May and the first week of June, power generation, consumption and demand for petroleum products have grown rapidly... In June, toll collection reached 70% of the February collection. Railway freight traffic improved by 26% compared to April,” he said.Even the rural economy has gathered pace, he said. “This time, area of kharif crop was 13% more than the previous year. This year, both production and procurement of wheat have increased. Till now, 11% more wheat is procured compared to last year. This means, more money reached the farmer. These indicators... show that the Indian economy is ready to bounce back fast,” he said.The Prime Minister said India will reduce its import dependence, which is part of the government’s self-reliant India initiative that was launched as a Rs 20-lakh crore economic stimulus package between May 13 and May 17.The Prime Minister has previously said India should turn the public health crisis into an opportunity to create an “Atmanirbhar Bharat” by ensuring that products the country imports start getting manufactured in India.“Atmanirbhar Bharat means that India will reduce its dependence on imports. Atmanirbhar Bharat means that India will save foreign exchange worth lakhs of crore spent on imports, and use that [money] for the welfare of the poor,” he said.PM Modi said that India’s success and its growth is certain. “We can become self-reliant. You will recollect, until recently, we would import N95 mask, Corona testing kits, personal protective equipment – PPE, ventilators. Now the country is meeting its demand through Make in India. Very soon, we will become an exporter of important medical products. You [the industry] have confidence, you keep your morale high, we can together achieve this objective,” he said.According to experts, the Prime Minister’s speech should be taken seriously in the present context of an economic slump due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the recent stand-off at the border by China, the biggest supplier of cheap manufactured goods to India. India-China bilateral trade is heavily tilted in favour of China. According to trade figures released by the General Administration of Customs of China (GACC), India’s trade deficit with China was $56.77 billion in 2019. Bilateral trade between the two countries was about $92.68 billion that year.Deepak Bagla, managing director and CEO of Invest India, said: “The government is serious working on a self-reliant India. The domestic sentiment is against Chinese goods and the industry cannot ignore this phenomenon, which is getting stronger day by day,” he said.He said the three key strengths present in the industry can help its transformation. First is nimbleness in the modification of the business model. “How the industry ramped up production of PPE from zero to 450,000 per day,” he said.“The second is efficient use of capital and the third is innovation. The most of it is seen among MSMEs [micro, small and medium enterprises], who contribute 30% of the GDP [gross domestic product] and the government is focusing on this segment that would achieve its objective of self-reliance,” he added.Vinod Kumar, president at the India SME Forum said that PM’s thrust on Atmanirbhar Bharat was a game changer for MSMEs. “Rationalisation of import duty and antidumping duty are bound to reduce India’s overdependence on imports and re-position India as a serious exporter,” he said.Ram Singh, professor at the Delhi School of Economics, said that India has the potential to become self-reliant, but in some sectors, its production is critically dependent on cheap Chinese imports. “We import more than 70% of APIs [active pharmaceutical ingredients] for production of some drugs and medicines. In absence of Chinese imports, our cost of production will go up [in the short run], but it will serve us well in the medium and long term,” he said.He pointed at the current ecosystem of start-ups in India, which is hugely funded by China and proposed that the government unlock the country’s vast reserve of human capital. “Our investment in higher education, and research and development is less than what China had 20 years ago. If we are serious about self-reliant India, we cannot afford wastage of the most important national asset,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coalsector-out-of-years-of-lockdown-says-pm-modi/story-bFyVBujsi64qINcNQvtoPP.html
19-06-2020||India||Cong stakes claim to form govt in Manipur, seeks a special session||The Congress on Thursday staked a claim for form the next government in Manipur a day after three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmakers resigned and six others withdrew their support to chief minister Biren Singh-led ruling coalition.Chaltonlien Amo, a Congress leader, said they submitted an application to governor Najma Heptullah requesting her to convene a special assembly session for a no-confidence motion against the government.“We want the governor to call the newly-formed Secular Progressive Front (SPF), under Okram Ibobi Singh, leader of the single largest party, the Congress, to form the government after dismissing the present ministry as it no longer commands a majority.”Okram Ibobi Singh wrote to Heptullah, saying they have moved the no-confidence while calling for the session “at the shortest possible time” to vote on it. He wrote alternatively, “since the present ministry is in minority, it may be dismissed outright”.He appended letters of support from other members of SPF—20 from Congress, four from National People’s Party (NPP), one Trinamool Congress (TMC), and an Independent lawmaker.The four NPP, one TMC legislator and the Independent lawmaker withdrew support to the coalition government on Wednesday. The three BJP lawmakers, whose resignations were accepted by the Speaker, have joined the Congress.Meanwhile, the Manipur high court on Thursday directed the assembly Speaker that orders regarding disqualification of the Congress MLAs be kept in abeyance till Friday.NPP leader Y Joykumar Singh, a former deputy chief minister, said they will form the next government led by Congress. “The government’s handling of the Covid-19 situation and interference in ministries handled by our party’s ministers are some reason why we decided to withdraw support to the government,” he said. The BJP’s strength has been reduced to 18 and it has the support of five more lawmakers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-stakes-claim-to-form-govt-in-manipur-seeks-a-spl-session/story-ZuVAb6s1cuQdNReYdTRBBL.html
19-06-2020||India||India elected to UNSC as non-permanent member||Washington/New Delhi: India was on Thursday elected a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council with 184 of the 192 votes polled as officials said solutions to the Covid-19 crisis, reforms of multilateral systems, and enhanced counter-terror cooperation will be focus areas of the two-year term beginning in 2021.India was the endorsed candidate of the Asia-Pacific Group of UN member countries and faced no competition in the elections, whose results were announced early on Thursday (Indian time). Afghanistan withdrew in India’s favour in 2013 and the votes secured by India were much higher than the minimum threshold of a two-thirds majority or 128 votes.The elections were conducted by secret ballot, and people familiar with developments said Pakistan was among the eight countries that did not vote for India. The people, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted the overwhelming number of votes received by India indicated Arab and Muslim countries were not swayed by Pakistan’s campaign opposing India’s candidature.“Deeply grateful for the overwhelming support shown by the global community for India’s membership of the @UN Security Council. India will work with all member countries to promote global peace, security, resilience and equity,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted.“We have received overwhelming support and I’m deeply humbled by the tremendous confidence which the member states of the United Nations have reposed in India,” T S Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative to the UN, said in a video message.“India will become a member of the Security Council at a critical juncture and we are confident that in the Covid- and the post-Covid world, India will continue to provide leadership and a new orientation for a reformed multilateral system,” he said.Officials said the strong support for India demonstrated the goodwill the country enjoys. This will be the eighth time India will be serving in the Security Council. Vikas Swarup, secretary (West) in the external affairs ministry, said finding innovative and inclusive solutions to the Covid-19 crisis, reforming multilateral forums and organisations, including the UN, and enhancing counter-terror cooperation will be focus areas for India during its stint. “We will act as a voice of reason and moderation and a firm believer in respect for international law and peaceful settlement of disputes,” he told a media briefing.Swarup refused to speculate about the eight countries that did not vote for India, saying: “Focus on the 184 – this reflects an almost universal acceptance, the most widespread support possible.”Asked about reports that Pakistan had politicised the elections, Swarup replied: “Unfortunately, this is the kind of behaviour we have now been seeing from Pakistan over the past many, many months and years. They always rake up bilateral issues in multilateral forums. They have almost made it a norm for their policy.”He said one of India’s main priorities is enhancing counter-terrorism action by the UN Security Council. During its last stint in the body in 2011-12, India had chaired the UN Counter-Terrorism Committee and brought in the concept of zero tolerance for terror.“During our coming term, we will work to enhance the global action against terrorism, their supporters and sympathisers and safe havens by seeking the streamlining of the process of sanctioning of the terrorists and terrorist entities. The process of sanctions also needs to be depoliticised as there is no justification for any act of terrorism,” he said.He added that India will also work for the finalisation of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism it had proposed in 1996.The UN system, Swarup said, needs reform urgently and all its bodies, including the Security Council and World Health Organization, need to change to reflect contemporary realities. Rajiv Bhatia, a distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said India should play a calibrated role in the UN Security Council instead of creating unnecessarily high expectations.“We have to be happy and satisfied with the election result and not euphoric. The global geopolitical situation is very complex. If we think we can push reforms in a big way by sitting in the UN Security Council, that would be unrealistic,” he said.“We must do whatever we can to strengthen multilateralism and build coalitions that can help some of the common causes of the international community,” Bhatia added.The others which went through were Mexico, also an endorsed candidate from its Latin American and Caribbean Group, and Ireland and Norway from the Western European and Other Group.The voting took place in a phased manner for the first time in the world body’s 75-year history. Member countries were allowed into the general assembly, where voting took place, in smaller groups of 20 because of social distancing norms.The Security Council has 15 members, including five permanent members — the US, the UK, France, Russia and China. Half of the 10 non-permanent members are elected every year for a two-year term, starting on January 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-elected-to-unsc-as-non-permanent-member/story-RebAqBFErmoTgaZHCTwzmK.html
19-06-2020||India||Health, safety and security of every student important: Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank||New Delhi: The Union human resources development minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank spoke to Amandeep Shukla about reopening schools after the lockdown, CBSE board exams for students in containment zones, and the new education policy, among other issues. Edited excerpts of an email interview:The HRD ministry has initiated a consultation with states on the process of reopening schools. What is the progress on this?The ministry has only initiated the consultation with states and Union Territories for preparing guidelines and SOPs -- for school health and hygiene, safety protocols, and academic and administrative matters -- to be taken into consideration when states and UTs decide to reopen schools. It is not for deciding the dates for reopening schools. The decision for reopening of schools will be taken by the concerned state government or UT administration as and when they find it safe to reopen schools following the guidelines of the MHA and the ministry of health.Has the ministry prepared a road map for opening of schools? Is there a possibility that the schools may open in some states or areas while those with high rates of COVID-19 incidence may teach online?Education is on the concurrent list. It is for the state government or UT administration to prepare the road map for reopening of schools and also decide the dates for reopening of schools in their respective regions. MHRD will be coming out with broad parameters to ensure uniformity across the nationSeveral reports suggest that many parents may not be comfortable to send their children to schools. How will you address those concerns?I understand the apprehensions of parents. The concerns of the parents and other stakeholders will be considered by the state government or UT administration before deciding to open the schools. I want to assure every parent that the health, safety and security of each and every students is of utmost importance to the government. I am sure that the decision will be undertaken in the student’s best interest after assessing the situation.The CBSE is to conduct Class X and XII board exams from July 1 to July 15. What measures will be put in place to ensure these exams are conduct safely?To address the issue of safe conduct of examinations, CBSE has taken two decisions in consultation with the HRD ministry: the examinations would now be conducted in the respective schools of the candidates instead of the examination centre already allotted; and CBSE will allow change of examination centre in respect of candidates who have shifted and are residing in some other district in the country than the place of their school. CBSE has also started a helpline (1800-11-8002) to address all the concerns of parents and students. The services are available between 9.30am and 5pm on all working days.In case a student finds it difficult to take the exam, as in states like Delhi the number of cases being reported are high, will there be a redressal mechanism? For instance, a student from a containment zone or a student who is in isolation may not be able to take the exam.In the containment zone, no examination centre will be permitted. In case of schools falling in containment zones as on date, examination centre of the students of these schools will be allotted outside the containment zone.For the preventive measures, directives issued by Union government and CBSE will be duly followed by the schools.What is the status of the New Education Policy? There have been several measures like starting of class-wise channels planned by the HRD ministry. Are any of the lessons learnt during the Covid-19 phase going to be included?The ministry is coherently working at a faster pace on the New Education Policy. We will submitting it to the Cabinet soon.Given that the Covid-19 pandemic has presented unique challenges to learning around the world. More than 35 crore students and 1.08 crore teachers across 15 lakh schools, 1,028 universities, 41901 colleges and 10 726 stand-alone institutes are unable to attend the classes due to nationwide closure of the education institutes as India prepares to fight against the pandemic. The crisis definitely needed to be converted into an opportunity. It became imperative from India to take steps to mitigate the immediate risks and continue to provide education to all children; and build education resilience as a strategic imperative across the sector. The pandemic gave me an opportunity to build a resilient and sustainable education for all the students. E–learning definitely has a long way to go. We are devising strategies to reach the farthest student.You have said that mid-day meals be provided to children during the current phase. How much has been possible in terms of providing meals? Are you planning to introduce any immunity-building food items in the scheme?India has taken various measures to prevent the spreading of this pandemic in the country. In these difficult crisis times, the poor vulnerable sections of the society with loss of livelihood leading to inadequate reserves of food are severely affected and children are bearing the brunt. Consequent undernourishment or malnourishment may lower their immunity against Covid-19. Thus, it becomes even more important to provide food especially to the poor and needy children to meet their nutritional requirements and thereby to safeguard their immunity.To meet the nutritional requirements of the eligible children, states and UTs have been advised to provide mid-day meal or its equivalent food security allowance inclusive of foodgrains and cooking cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-safety-and-security-of-every-student-important-ramesh-pokhriyal-nishank/story-eNaxlRriXQ9VSO6UvHPkHN.html
19-06-2020||India||Annual Jagannath Rath Yatra will not be held this year, rules apex court||New Delhi: The annual Rath Yatra scheduled to be held on June 23 at the Jagannath Temple in Odisha’s Puri district will not take place this year in view of the Covid -19 pandemic, the Supreme Court ordered on Thursday.The order was passed after a plea by an NGO, Odisha Vikas Parishad, pointed out the public health risk involved if more than one million devotees congregate for the event at a time when Covid-19 cases are rising.“Having regard to the danger presented by such a large gathering of people for the Rath Yatra, we consider it appropriate in the interests of public health and safety of citizens who are devotees to restrain the respondents (state and district authorities and managing committee of Jagannath temple) from holding the Rath Yatra this year”, the bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde ordered.The court also directed that no such Rath Yatra should be allowed in any other part of Odisha.“We direct that there shall be no Rath Yatra anywhere in the temple town (Puri) of Odisha or in any other part of the state this year. We further direct that there shall be no activities secular or religious associated with the Rath Yatra during this period”, the order read.The Rath Yatra lasts for 10 to 12 days and involves a procession of chariots containing the deities Lord Jagannath, his brother Lord Balabhadra, and sister Devi Subhadra.On May 7, the Union home ministry granted permission to the Odisha government to carry out the construction of chariots for conducting Rath Yatra subject to the condition that no religious congregation takes place while it is constructed.The central government had also left it to the discretion of the Odisha government to decide whether or not to hold the Rath Yatra based on the conditions prevailing at the relevant point of time.The Odisha government, on June 1, issued guidelines extending the lockdown in all Covid-19 containment zones in the state until midnight of June 30. It allowed reopening of prohibited activities in a phased manner in areas outside containment zones, though religious places continue to remain closed for the public till June 30. Even in areas which are not containment zones, social, political, sports, entertainment, academic, cultural and religious functions and other large congregations remain closed.All the temples, including the Jagannath temple in Puri, are closed across the state for devotees since March 22 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.The petitioner pointed out that despite the restrictions, all the rituals leading to the Rath Yatra, such as Askhay Trutiya (the day on which the construction of the chariots start) and Snana Purnima were allowed to be performed by the state government, leading to the conclusion that the government may allow the Rath Yatra on June 23.When the case came up for hearing on Thursday, the bench, which also comprised justices Dinesh Maheshwari and AS Bopanna, made it clear at the outset that it was inclined to stay the festivities.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the central government, said that the issue was sensitive and sought a day’s time so that government could study the issue and get back to the court with a response but the bench disagreed.“This is a very serious matter. We will pass an order today. Lord Jagannath will forgive us,” CJI Bobde remarked.The petitioner also referred to the Tablighi Jamaat Muslim congregation in mid-March at the Nizamuddin area in Delhi that led to a spurt in Covid-19 cases across the country.The Odisha government, represented by senior counsel Harish Salve, did not oppose the prayer in the petition but requested the court that whatever order it passes should be clear and precise leaving no room for any confusion.As the hearing drew to a close, the CJI, on a lighter note, alluded to the origins of the English word juggernaut. “It is derived from Jagannath and it means something which cannot be stopped,” he said.“But the court has stopped it today,” Mehta responded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/annual-jagannath-rath-yatra-will-not-be-held-this-year-rules-apex-court/story-PPYKk6ddWVOYjHn2DoGSQJ.html
19-06-2020||India||Mobile Covid-19 testing labs inaugurated||Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Thursday inaugurated India’s first mobile testing laboratory for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) diagnosis in remote and inaccessible areas with no or limited testing facilities. No decision has been taken on where it would be started.The World Health Organization (WHO) has said ramping up testing is the best way of slowing the advance of the pandemic. India has increased its capacity to test with Delhi, one of the worst-hit by the pandemic in the country, conducting 8,093 tests, the most conducted in a single day, on Wednesday.Vardhan said most Indians live in rural areas and the country has about 650,000 villages. “This laboratory in a mobile van can easily be deployed in villages where testing facilities are limited. It will also be a boon for many inaccessible areas in the Northeast, and areas where there are no motorable roads. The core of this mobile lab can be disengaged and mounted on a cargo train to be transported to the desired destination. India’s railway network is spread far and wide,” he said at the launch of the lab.The I-Lab (infectious disease lab) has the capacity for testing about 250 samples through real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) based antibody techniques daily. It includes 50 RT-PCR samples. Officials said another set of machines are expected to be installed to double the capacity to test to 500 samples daily. The government plans to have 50 such mobile labs to promote the last mile access to Covid-19 testing, according to the minister. In the longer run, such facilities will be provided for testing other infectious diseases like tuberculosis. A team from Andhra Pradesh MedTech Zone Limited, an enterprise under the state government dedicated to medical device manufacturing, designed the biosafety level II (BSL-II) lab in eight days, by June 14, at the cost of Rs 1 crore. It is a department of biotechnology initiative.There are four BSL levels based on the infectious organisms that the researchers are dealing with. BSL-I is considered to be the least hazardous, while BSL-IV poses a maximum safety risk. Each level builds on the previous category, adding more layers of constraints and barriers to contain contamination.The organisms include viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, etc. SAR-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, belongs to the BSL-II category.The mobile labs will be a part of the department of biotechnology’s hub and spoke model. There are close to 20 hubs in the country with 100 testing laboratories, and these labs will be linked to these hubs.“The project is a part of India’s effort to expand its network of facilities for handling infectious diseases in the country, both in terms of testing and treating,” said Vardhan.Experts say in the absence of full-fledged labs having mobile testing is a good idea. “BSL II labs are not everywhere so having these labs on site will definitely help. Linking them with some main laboratory will also help in cross-checking results in case of any doubts,” said Dr Charu Hans, a former head of the microbiology department at Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mobile-covid-testing-labs-inaugurated/story-tod0zx5hVv9Y6IWOThUJzH.html
19-06-2020||India||NCR cities cannot be separate from Delhi during crisis: Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday emphasised the need to have a unified strategy in Delhi-National Capital Region (Delhi-NCR) to tackle the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), adding that suburbs such as Gurugram, Noida and Ghaziabad can’t be separated from the Capital in the public health emergency.Shah held a meeting with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and senior officials of the Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments to review the Covid-19 situation in Delhi-NCR amid a surge in the number of cases of the infectious disease. Delhi recorded 2,877 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, which took the total in the city to 49,979. “In view of the structure of Delhi-NCR region, all concerned bodies need to unite and work on a common strategy against the coronavirus pandemic. In this context, I met with Delhi Chief Minister and senior officials of Center and Delhi-NCR today to discuss how to evolve a strategy as soon as possible,” Shah tweeted.At the meeting, Shah said that keeping in view the close-knit urban structure of the NCR region, it was necessary for all concerned authorities in Delhi-NCR to come together to tackle the virus, according to a statement.The Union home minister has directed officials from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to submit information about Covid-19 beds, ventilators, oxygen cylinders, ICUs and ambulances available with them and their plan to augment these resources by July 15 July to his ministry so that a common strategy could be devised in Delhi-NCR.Authorities in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi have imposed border restrictions at different points over the past few weeks, leading to complaints of inconvenience from commuters, some of them engaged in essential services.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal recently announced that only patients from Delhi would be treated at hospitals run by the Delhi government and at private hospitals in the Capital. Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, however, overruled the Delhi government’s decision, saying that people from all states, including the adjoining cities, would be treated at all facilities in the Capital.A senior home ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Gurugram, Noida, Sonepat, Faridabad and Ghaziabad are important suburbs and crucial to the Capital. “They cannot refuse to make available each others’ facilities. They have to work with each other else one or the other will be overwhelmed by the pandemic,” the official said.The home minister also suggested that the NCR districts could consider adopting the Rs 2,400 charge fixed for Covid-19 tests in Delhi, besides the new rapid antigen methodology being implemented in the national capital from Thursday.A committee under the chairmanship of NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul has fixed the price of Rs 2,400 for Covid-19 tests in the national capital. The Delhi government commenced Covid-19 testing through the rapid antigen methodology at 169 centres in and around containment zones of the city from Thursday. The Union home minister said that in order to control the virus, there was a need to test more and it was also necessary to identify and treat those who were diagnosed as positive. “The Union home minister said there is a need to work in a mission mode,” the official statement said.Shah has held a series of meetings with Delhi lieutenant governor Baijal, CM Kejriwal and senior officials this week over the strategy to augment Delhi’s health care infrastructure amid the Covid-19 outbreak.On Thursday, he told the meeting that a committee also decided on the rates for Covid-19 beds and treatment, and these rates could also be applied to hospitals in the NCR region after consultations.Shah also assured support from the Centre to the authorities in Delhi-NCR in the fight against the disease, which has so far killed 12,605 people in India.On June 4, the Supreme Court asked the Centre to convene a meeting of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana for easing interstate movement at all borders in the NCR. It also observed that there should be a consistent policy in this regard.The Centre informed the apex court that the union home secretary had convened a joint meeting on June 9 with chief secretaries of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to deal with the issue and now there was no barrier on these borders.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncr-cities-cannot-be-separate-from-delhi-during-crisis-shah/story-JMZds8ZMBo4zlv8I1pHjqM.html
19-06-2020||India||Girl from Nilgiri leads petition to ‘protect’ Western Ghats, Centre, states served notice||The Supreme Court has issued notice to the Union ministry of environment and forest and the six states lining the Western Ghats in response to a petition seeking reinstatement of the recommendations made in a report filed by Western Ghats Ecology Experts Panel (WGEEP).A young girl from the Nilgiris, M Kaviya, is the lead petitioner among the 23 individuals who moved the plea in SC. The petition, as interim relief, prays for allowing only those activities permitted in the WGEEP report in specified areas.M Kaviya is one among the seven children listed as petitioners and supported by several others including environmental activists and NGOs like the Goa Foundation from Goa, Ankur Trust from Maharashtra and Kerala’s River Research Centre apart from others from the six Western Ghats states.The WGEEP report by renowned ecologist Dr Madhav Gadgil was submitted in 2011, but its recommendations to restrict damaging activities like mining, quarrying and red-category industries in the Western Ghats are yet to be implemented by the Centre or the governments of the six states.The matter was listed before a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, who directed that a notice be issued to the relevant parties including centre and governments of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.“[We] have approached the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution of India for urgent directions and orders that will result in an effective, sustainable and credible conservation regime for the Western Ghats, its diverse ecosystems and ecologically sensitive zones,” Claude Alvares, Director of Goa Foundation, said. Alvares stated that a population of 50 million people is directly dependent on the Western Ghats and its ecology, and another 200 million people are indirectly dependent.“The future of entire southern India is intimately linked with the healthy survival of the Western Ghats. The governments have abjectly failed to do justice to the Western Ghats, despite being empowered to do so,” he added.The petition has cited the “massive environmental disasters” that struck several parts of Kerala and Karnataka during the 2018 monsoon, and in 2019, killing 483 people in Kerala, 16 in Kodagu, Karnataka besides forcing 4.50 lakh people into relief camps as houses were destroyed, roads was washed out and buildings collapsed.Acknowledging that the Western Ghats are a global biodiversity hotspot, and hence needed to be conserved, the Union Government had set up the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel headed by Dr Madhav Gadgil back in 2009.Dr Gadgil had recommended that large swathes of areas falling within the Western Ghats be marked as ecologically sensitive areas.However, owing to opposition from states, the MoEF set up another committee called the High Level Working Group headed by former ISRO Chief Dr K Kasturirangan who further reduced the area to be notified as ecologically sensitive. However, this report too was rejected by many states.“The Kasturirangan Report has been watered down considerably by various State governments, with the active collaboration of the Ministry of Environment, to a level of meaninglessness,” Alvares said.He further pointed out that Kerala has excluded the entire area recommended by the Kasturirangan Committee and set up its own committee, Goa and Maharashtra have sought to exclude a large number of villages from proposed eco zones, while Karnataka has not accepted the Kasturirangan report. “As a result, the region, recognized as one of the world’s eight biodiversity hotspots, does not have the protection that was sought by the environment ministry when it set up the WGEEP,” he said.Back in November last year, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had set the ministry of environment, forests and climate change a fresh deadline of March 2020 for the finalization of eco sensitive zones in the Western Ghats, and warned that any further delay would mean that the advisor in the MoEF would not get any salary till the notification was finalized.The ministry had apprised the tribunal of states’ demand for more and more exclusions citing the need for development. It was said that the need for development sometimes runs into conflict with the need for environment protection and that both aspects need to be balanced.In August 2018, the NGT, while frowning upon yet another delay in finalization of the eco sensitive zones in the Western Ghats, had barred the linked states from making any changes to the ecologically sensitive areas as it “may seriously affect the environment”, especially in the view of the floods in Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/girl-from-nilgiri-leads-petition-to-protect-western-ghats-centre-states-served-notice/story-rXgyChlmSfEkdcqGoxiO9J.html
19-06-2020||India||On Ladakh border incident, China official asked 6 questions. Answers none||India and China have agreed to deal with the “serious matter” triggered by the violent clash between border troops in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on Monday in a “just” manner, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Thursday.“Both sides (India and China have) agreed to deal with the serious matter caused by the conflict at the Valley in a just manner, jointly observe the commander level talks consensus and deescalate the tensions as soon as possible and safeguard the peace and tranquility,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said at the regular ministry briefing on Thursday.Zhao took six questions on the border incident but managed to skirt it all by repeating statements and not revealing China’s casualty figures.Also Watch | China blames India; Jaishankar Vs Rahul; no jawan missing: Latest updates He declined to respond to queries on reports of China building a dam on the Galwan river at the Sino-Indian border to obstruct its flow.To a question on whether the confrontation started when the Indian troops arrived to demolish structures set up by China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Zhao reiterated China’s allegation, squarely blaming the Indian troops for the incident.“The right and wrong of this case is very clear and responsibility doesn’t lie with the Chinese side,” he said, adding that China has provided the details of the case.Twenty Indian Army soldiers, including a colonel, were killed in the clashes with Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on Monday night.Beijing hasn’t revealed the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) casualty numbers though China’s government-controlled official media has acknowledged it without mentioning numbers.Zhao reiterated Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi’s statement, which was issued after he had a telephone conversation with India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar.The Indian minister conveyed India’s protest in “strongest terms” to Beijing and said the unprecedented development will have “serious impact” on the bilateral ties. He asked the Chinese side to reassess its actions and take corrective steps, the ministry of external affairs said in a statement in New Delhi.Separately on Thursday, Hua Chunying, director general of the Chinese foreign ministry’s information department, said India must not underestimate its firm will to safeguard its territorial sovereignty.“India must not misjudge the current situation or underestimate China’s firm will to safeguard its territorial sovereignty,” Hua tweeted.“Indian front-line troops broke the consensus and crossed the Line of Actual Control, deliberately provoking and attacking Chinese officers and soldiers, thus triggering fierce physical conflicts and causing casualties,” she said in a follow-up tweet.A large number of Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in an eyeball-to-eyeball situation in Galwan Valley and other areas of eastern Ladakh for the last five weeks, since May, including in Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie in eastern Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-to-deal-with-border-incident-in-just-manner-beijing/story-Bgyd2SvWLyL6kRsTgXTJoN.html

They were sent the details in the mistaken belief that it was being conveyed to the family of the deceased soldier.While Sunil’s army unit had informed his brother Anil about the mix-up and confirmed Sunil’s well being to him on Wednesday afternoon itself, the family was not delivered completely out of the fear of losing their loved one till they heard Sunil’s voice the next morning on the phone.Sunil’s wife Menaka said she was relieved to hear his husband on the phone during the conference call that was specially arranged by his army unit. “I burst out with joy as I had no doubt that it was Roshini’s father’s voice speaking on the other side,” she was quoted as saying by Hindi daily Hindustan.Earlier on Wednesday, villagers and local politicians including MLA Chandrika Rai had assembled at Sunil’s house to give strength to the family and condoled his passing, they were equally relieved by the news of his well being, received later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-soldier-s-family-lost-all-in-16-hours-between-2-phone-calls-then-erupted-with-joy/story-nJkHkkwlmmo6e2Ix6kKp3I.html

India wasn’t the first country to restrict use of Zoom within the government. Taiwan has banned government agencies from using Zoom, the German Foreign Ministry restricts its use of Zoom to emergency situations on personal computers while the United States Senate advises members to use other platforms. The company had responded to the home ministry advisory, insisting that it was serious about user security.There have been calls for action against mobile apps that are perceived to be compromising security from time to time. And companies such as the hugely-popular video popular video-sharing app TikTok - owned and operated by Chinese internet company ByteDance - have issued denials.But officials said there were inputs that many Android and IOS apps, either developed by Chinese developers or launched by companies with Chinese links, had the potential to be used as spyware or other malicious ware. There have been reports that security agencies had advised security personnel from using them in view of the “detrimental impact that this could have on data security.Such concerns about backdoors in China-linked hardware or software have been frequently articulated by western security agencies too. One argument has been that China could use its access to degrade communications services in case of conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/intel-agencies-red-flag-use-of-52-mobile-apps-with-links-to-china-complete-list/story-B50Slf39aSnVOrCcS92l1N.html
19-06-2020||Editorials||Returning to the horseshoe table||India returns to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) with a unique opportunity to win friends and influence governments. The nation will assume the non-permanent seat for Asia after a gap of seven years. It does so unopposed, endorsed by the other Asian member-states, with the only other candidate, Afghanistan, pulling out because of its closeness to New Delhi. All of this is a reminder that India has traditionally punched above its weight at UN, partly because of its ability to be a full-spectrum member, active in the Group of 77 developing countries as well as intimate with the permanent five.UN is drifting, paralysed by great power rivalry and financial difficulties. Substantial multilateralism has shifted to groupings such as the G-7 and the G-20. Smaller and poorer countries are understandably feeling marginalised within the international system. Yet, they are essential to many of the biggest international concerns including the climate crisis and terrorism. This is an opportunity for India to score points, boost its profile and otherwise have an international impact despite lacking the money or muscle that the United States or China have. Many see a permanent seat as the end-all of India’s UN ambitions. The point of having such a seat is to be able to persuade other countries to work together. It is only when India shows it can do things even as a non-permanent member does its case for a seat at the high table become incontrovertible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/returning-to-the-horseshoe-table/story-osT7DX8HIQyalftGp1mnAL.html
