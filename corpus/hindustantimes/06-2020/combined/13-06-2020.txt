13-06-2020||News||I had Covid-19. And society decided to stigmatise me||It was the afternoon of June 3 when I got my coronavirus disease (Covid-19) test report as ”detected “. It was done voluntarily so I would not have be quarantined at Srinagar airport where I had intended to go for a break.It came as a rude shock and the next step was mandatory home quarantine. I started it at once by moving to a nearby flat to avoid any exposure to relatives who may have been at high-risk.This quarantine has been a nightmare because of a cascade of events initiated by my neighbours who sent a written complaint to the district magistrate (DM) and Station House Officer of the police station nearby, alleging that I was putting the lives of the residents in grave danger. I could see them taking pictures of me the surrounding balconies and CCTV’s footages of mine were also kept as evidence. I got a warning from DM following a First Information Report (FIR) recorded by the police saying that I shouldn’t move out of the premises until June 16. It was a very unpleasant experience for me to see children looking frightened when they saw me and even one neighbour showering abuses at me. I started getting abusive WhatsApp messages from them and the resident welfare association accusing me of being a liar and a threat to them. The maid who used to bring food once a day to my doorstep was set upon by a neighbour and so she stopped coming. The local chemist who used to send medicines after a phone call also refused to send any medication.The garbage collector also declined to pick up the bags. The newspaper vendor stopped giving me newspapers. Stigma is a global phenomenon and becomes prominent from time to time. Well known examples include Mary Mallon (Typhoid Mary), the asymptomatic typhoid carrier who was captured by authorities in early 1900s. The injustice done to African-Americans stigmatised for spreading syphilis in early 2000s comes to mind. Misconceptions related to HIV-AIDs are in our recent memory. Finally, it was Magic Johnson, the baseball star and a champion of under-privileged youth, whose confession of being HIV-positive helped a great deal in increasing awareness of the disease. I was reminded of old days when leprosy patients were supposed to carry a bell to inform others to be careful and move away. This stigma is a part of the history of humanity, despite the fact that it is a disease with low communicability. Leprosy patients used to be quarantined for life in colonies. Some of them, with physical deformities brought on by the disease, are still seen begging on roads being carried in carts. In this case, I have seen personal discrimination from close quarters and also numerous media reports on patients and their families being treated as outcasts. There are reports of dead bodies being disowned by their families and crematoriums not accepting them for their last rites. Do individuals living alone in quarantine for the virus not require even one meal a day? I am fortunate in that I have a separate place of my own. But what about asymptomatic persons who do not need hospitalisation? Hospitals of Delhi and many other cities are already full of patents who need monitoring and special care.Are we are making Covid-19 into a sort of disease like leprosy where the stigma has been transferred? By now, we know the preventive methods to contain the spread. This stigma needs to be tackled through education and also, in extreme cases, by punishing the perpetrators legally. At the current rate of spread, who knows whether you may be the next person in line to become infected and, then, unfortunately, ostracised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/i-had-covid-19-and-society-decided-to-stigmatise-me/story-pwLgTsUbUycqrAqI9CAROL.html
13-06-2020||News||Indian Railways has never been safer. What next | Opinion||If the number of deaths on tracks is a measure of safety performance of Indian Railways (IR), the performance in 2019-20 is truly commendable. In 2014-15, 292 people were killed in railway accidents. This figure drops to 5 in 2019-20. Overall too, the number of accidents have come down from 135 in 2014-15 to 55 in 2019-20. This is a standing ovation to the sincere and long-drawn safety measures executed intelligently. And there is more. There were no casualties at Unmanned level crossings (UMLC) in 2019-20, a sharp contrast to 2014-15 when 130 people were killed. The elimination of UMLCs has led to visible dividends. It couldn’t have been better, the best so far since 1853 when Railways started in India. Now what next?The aim is to have zero accidents with robust safety systems in place. But accidents do happen, fewer than in the past. In 2019-20, derailments constituted a significant proportion - as many as 40 out of 55 accidents. The Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) design of coaches has reduced fatalities during derailments but the railways certainly need to bring down cases of derailments in the first place. A safe rail wheel interaction at normal and high speeds, ensuring copybook rail maintenance parameters as also of coaches undergear should now be the focus of a realizable dream. Infusion of track machines in a big way would provide a much wanted fillip to reliable, quicker track maintenance. Another step would be to eliminate manned level crossings (MLC). This can now receive priority as UMLCs are now almost eliminated. Of course, getting rid of the MLCs is expensive and needs joint action with state governments but it’s time that MLCs are also targeted.But what remains a cause for continuing worry is the high contribution of “Failure of Railway staff “ as a prominent cause of accidents. As many as 40 out of 55 accidents in 2019-20 fall in this category. To be sure, this is a vast improvement over the 135 accidents classified under this category in 2014-15. Continuous training for skill upgradation and efforts to match the requirements of new technology will continue to occupy the attention of railway brass across departments.It is also time to take a hard call on deaths that happen because our trains do not require the doors of coaches to be shut before the train starts. Among the world’s major railways, it is only on Indian Railways that a train can start without closing and locking the door. But there is technology available to close this chronic lacunae and it isn’t too expensive. It will have a positive spinoff for passenger security on trains. The Tejas experiment is a welcome step in ensuring door closing before starting a train and needs to be carried forward. Air Conditioned trains are ideal to start with.Yet another effort should be to fence the tracks, especially in congested areas. Habitation near tracks is hazardous and reducing the speed of passing trains is at best, a temporary solution. If need be, people living too close to the tracks should be given alternate accommodation where feasible. It is difficult to fathom the distance of an approaching train when it is close to approach especially at night. Lives can be saved here.The strategy adopted by the current leadership of funding the safety efforts through Rail Suraksha Kosh seems to be working well. Once the funds are in place, safety enhancement is a matter of attitude and patience. The past performance indicators seem to reassure that the railways, under PM Modi’s leadership, are on the right track.(Arunendra Kumar is a former chairman of the Railway Board)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/indian-railways-has-never-been-safer-what-next--opinion/story-nVW6iUR35Z2v6lzickxKHK.html
13-06-2020||News||PM Modi re-engineered, reformed and cleaned up MGNREGS, writes Gajendra Singh Shekhawat||Sanjaya Baru, former press adviser to prime minister (PM) Manmohan Singh, in his tell-all book The Accidental Prime Minister, wrote about the morning of September 26, 2007, when a newly-selected general secretary of the Congress, Rahul Gandhi, visited the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) with Sonia Gandhi’s political adviser Ahmed Patel. The latter handed over a statement to be issued by the PMO , which said that Gandhi had urged the PM to expand the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) to 500 districts. Baru protested since it wasn’t the tradition of the PMO to issue statements given out by visitors to the PM. Yet, by late evening, every media outlet was running the contents of the statement as a headline. Baru also noted the “Congress’s party obsession” to give the entire credit of MGNREGS to the Gandhi family. These incidents underline the obsession of the Gandhi family with the ownership of MGNREGS. Sonia Gandhi recently wrote an article where she accused the National Democratic Alliance government of falling back on the scheme after first criticising it. But she forgets that it was the abysmal handling of MGNREGS along with a string of corruption charges that led to the Congress-led government’s undoing in 2014.When this government came to power, MGNREGS was in a poor shape. It had the inherent power to be much more than the scheme that the Congress had envisaged. After understanding its problems, and the shoddy job that the previous government did in its execution, the PM declared MGNREGS as a living monument to the Congress government’s failures, but said that he would not let it die. Thus, the government re-engineered MGNREGS, fool-proofing it, pushing reforms, intertwining it with technology and making the feedback mechanism stronger. Riding on these reforms, this government revitalised MGNREGS. The funds allocated to MGNREGS for this fiscal year, excluding the additional allocation of Rs 40,000 crore in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis, was Rs 61,500 crore. This was larger than the combined budgetary allocation of Rs 60,000 crore during the last two years of the Congress (2012-13 and 2013-14). During the first tenure of the Modi government, Rs 2,64,864 crore was allocated to the scheme and the total expenditure was Rs 2,53,245 crore. On corroborating the yearly increase of budget allocation to programme during the first Modi government, one finds a 12.87% yearly increase in budget allocations. The rural job scheme is alive and kicking only because of this. Today, 99% wages under MNREGS are being paid electronically against 37% in 2013-14. There was massive corruption in how work was being given out; only a fraction of wages were reaching the intended beneficiaries. It was not that the Congress government had not acknowledged the presence of this massive fund leakage. PM Manmohan Singh, in 2009, admitted to the leakage of funds, yet, over the next five years, he did little to plug this.It was the late Rajiv Gandhi who said that of every rupee spent, only 15-17 paisa reached the beneficiary. Yet, despite being in power for many years, the Congress government failed to ensure that the taxpayers’ money did not end up in the pockets of spurious characters. Today, 400 schemes come under the Direct Benefit Transfer. Another famous-yet-abandoned child of the Congress was Aadhaar. The Modi government used it well and through the trinity of schemes — Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile (JAM) — plugged fund leakages. Another big issue was the massive use of fake job cards under MGNREGS. In 2010, the Planning Commission after evaluating MGNREGS had spoken of delayed payments and mass-scale corruption. The Modi government went on a massive cleaning spree. In 2017, nearly 10 million fake MGNREGS job cards were found and stuck-off from the scheme. It is indeed confusing to find Sonia Gandhi accuse this government of not issuing job cards, when fake job cards proliferated under her party’s rule. It is pity that she accuses this government of delayed payment, when only 34% of payment was done on time during her regime. In the Comptroller and Auditor General of India report (2007-12), it was mentioned that only 30% work under MGNREGS had been completed. Today, all the work is geo-tagged and target-driven approach towards MGNREGS has been given primacy. In the words of late Arun Jaitley: “Wage through MGNREGS will be through works that are more productive, asset creating and linked to agriculture and agri-related activities”. By converging various aspects, almost 60% of the work helps in natural resource management. Another major reform by this government is the addition of individual beneficiary work; today, 67% of all work amunts to individual beneficiaries. Apart from creating sustainable livelihoods, it is this reform that will aid our fight against Covid as this work can be done while maintaining social distancing. Today, when a resolute Modi 2.0 government is fighting the virus and its various outcomes, the Rs 1,01,500 crore allocated for MGNREGS will help India navigate this temporary crisis. The only reason why this government is using MGNREGS in its fight against Covid-19 is not because this government believes in the scheme’s political legacy that the Congress claims to own, but because we believe in the work done in reforming it and making it the reliable and powerful tool that it is today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/pm-modi-re-engineered-reformed-and-cleaned-up-mgnregs/story-80o3t8U6dfwSjIUAVL1UfL.html

13-06-2020||Mumbai||Fadnavis slams government for reducing testing in Mumbai||Former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has accused the state government of under testing in Mumbai to keep the numbers low. Fadnavis said that the number of Covid-19 infections has not reduced but the percentage of cases has come down because of fewer tests being conducted. “Against the capacity of 38,000 tests daily, only 14,000 samples are being taken in the state, while the number of tests in Mumbai has been reduced to 4,000 a day against the lab capacity of 12,000. Even now, 1,300 to 1,500 cases are reported daily in the city. Out of fear of the rise in numbers, the government is conducting fewer tests. Winning over the pandemic will not be possible by hiding the cases,” he said. The Leader of the Opposition in the state said that the case fatality rate in Maharashtra is too high, accounting for 42-45% of the total deaths in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fadnavis-slams-government-for-reducing-testing-in-mumbai/story-DJpQvBKHcgcJedNPlXUhfJ.html
13-06-2020||Mumbai||20K doctors respond to call for help; only 700 found eligible||There is an acute shortage of doctors at Covid care centres-2 (CCC-2) and hospitals despite the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) making Covid-19 duty mandatory for qualified doctors. Although 20,000 doctors responded to DMER’s call for doctors to report for duty in May, so far only 700 fulfil the criteria laid down by DMER, said the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).On May 4, DMER issued a circular asking the 25,000 registered doctors in the city to report for 15-day stints of compulsory Covid-19 duty. Non-attendance would be considered a breach of the Medical Council of India Code, which could lead to a doctor’s licence being suspended or cancelled.Of the 20,000 registered doctors who responded to the circular, DMER selected 4,246 and sent this list to BMC for screening. The shortlisted doctors were between 25 and 45 years of age since DMER disqualifies doctors above the age of 55 for Covid duty. Those working at civic, state government and central-government run hospitals were exempted. Later, doctors already practising at hospitals were also exempted. After screening the shortlisted doctors, BMC found only 700 doctors were available.“Most of the doctors are out of India. How are we supposed to assign them Covid duty in Mumbai? Also, many of the doctors are already working in private hospitals. We can’t uproot from their duty and assign them Covid duty. There is also a need for non-Covid doctors. We need general physicians who run clinics,” said a senior BMC officer on condition of anonymity.Though there is no available data for the number of physicians running private clinics, Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) estimates around 5,000 such doctors are available in Mumbai, who are below 55 years old. “The notice was mainly aimed at doctors who have clinics. They can work both in civic hospitals and their clinics simultaneously,” said Dr Shivkumar Utture, president, MMC, who clarified that approximately 5% of the registered live abroad. With the number of active Covid-19 cases rising to 28,682, BMC says more doctors are urgently needed. “We need a permanent solution to meet the shortage of doctors. After every 15 days, we can’t go through the same process of scanning or hunting for doctors,” said a senior official with BMC’s health department.As per the latest data from BMC, 26% of the available beds for Covid-19 patients are occupied. Of the 4,355 beds in dedicated Covid health centres (DCHCs) — where moderately-ill patients are admitted — only 794 are vacant. Only 558 beds out of the 6,095 in dedicated Covid hospitals (DCH), where critically ill patients are admitted, are available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/20k-doctors-respond-to-call-for-help-only-700-found-eligible/story-FOdzI7jyGVXUx4vnlfzwTK.html

13-06-2020||Mumbai||Blanket ban on online learning might not help, say experts||A day after the state education department recommended that the government set up rules barring online learning for students up to Class 2, several experts said a blanket ban on all e-learning might not be practical.Dr Samir Dalwai, developmental paediatrician from New Horizons Child Development Centre, said that children need positive age-appropriate stimulation for optimal brain development.“Pre-school teachers are an invaluable resource to keep children on their social-communication developmental track. We must restrict online learning to an hour of supervised, co-play between the child, parent, and the teacher, over an online medium,” he said. Dalwai, however, stressed that formal reading and writing must be banished from all preschool education — online and offline.On Friday, the education department submitted a list of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for restarting the new academic year 2020-21 from June 15. The document is now awaiting the chief minister’s nod.Dr Sagar Mundada, a city-based psychiatrist said “While students won’t miss out on any learning if online education does not take place for three months, they do need some kind of interaction with their peers. It is necessary for children to see new faces, to communicate, and hear someone else apart from their parents.”Experts on early childhood education said the government could put guidelines in place to regulate screen usage and ensure teaching is age-appropriate.“Schools will not open for another three months, which means children will lose out on connection and engagement with teachers. Parents will use online apps to ensure that children learn, and these apps will not be able to give the ‘serve and return’ interactions that teachers can give through live engagement platforms,” said Swati Popat Vats, president of the Early Childhood Association.Francis Joseph, co-founder, SLN Global Network, a professional network of schools and educators, said the government could allow online interactions for students of Classes 1 and 2 up to an hour daily. “This should be done with a break in between, and schools should ensure its implementation. Across the world, online learning has become the norm. While we do need regulation and guidelines about online learning, a blanket ban would not solve any purpose,” he said.Vikram Adsul, a teacher from Bandgar Wasti Zilla Parishad School in Karjat taluka, Ahmednagar, said most teachers in rural areas send e-content to the parents for their children’s viewing. “Our parents do not have sophisticated technology so we send them a few short videos and text which children can see and read in their free time. This kind of instruction is flexible and should not be banned,” he said.A section of parents, however, supports the state education department’s recommendation, they contend that it was becoming difficult to manage online classes for kids in addition to their work and household chores. “Children as young as two years are being forced to sit for online classes which should stop. However, with no online learning for students up to Class 2, parents will now have to be more hands-on and ensure that learning continues within the home,” said Aashna Sheikh, a city-based parent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/blanket-ban-on-online-learning-might-not-help-say-experts/story-Bsh1EFOxlsWEtHdosTgZyO.html
13-06-2020||Chandigarh||Two gangsters attack jail staff in Ludhiana after being caught with mobile phone||Inmates of the Central Jail here seem to have an easy access to mobile phones and internet.Two gangsters, Gurjant Singh alias Janta and Jagroop Singh alias Joopa, attacked jail guards when they recovered a mobile phone from them.The Division number 7 police have lodged a case against the gangsters for possessing mobile phone and attacking jail employees.The accused Gurjant Singh alias Janta of Saddu Shahwala of Ferozepur and Jagroop Singh alias Joopa of Chananke village are already facing trial in several criminal cases, including kidnapping, robbery and attempt to murder and possessing illegal weapons.Joopa and Gurjant were arrested by the Amritsar police in 2016 with weapons. Joopa is also a member of the Jaggu Bhagwanpuria gang.Gurjant was again arrested by the Jagraon police in 2019 for possessing illegal weapons.According to Shiv Kumar, assistant superintendent of jail, the jail staff conducted a special checking in the jail on June 11. Both gangsters are lodged in the high security zone of the jail. When the jail staff, along with CRPF jawans, recovered the mobile phone from them, they attacked them in an attempt to snatch the mobile from them. ASI Harshpal Singh, investigating the case, said a case under sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of Common intention) of the IPC and section 52 (A) of the prisons Act has been registered against the accused at the Division number 7 police station.The police will bring the accused on production warrant for questioning to know from where they had procured the mobile phone.FIRING AT JAIL INMATE’S HOUSE: ‘CONSPIRACY HATCHED IN JAIL’Investigators, probing the incident of firing at the house of Rishav alias Nannu, an accused in an attempt to murder case and lodged in the jail, have claimed that the conspiracy was hatched inside the jail.Three accused, who are lodged in the jail and had easy access to mobile phones, internet and social networking sites, had directed their accomplices to fire at the house of Rishav and district Youth Congress (central) president Shubham Arora.The Division number 3 police on Friday brought the three accused on production warrant from Ludhiana central jail for questioning. The police have booked a total of ten accused in the case.The accused, brought from the jail, are Manwinder Singh alias Nikka Jattana, of Jattana village of Mansa district, Manpritpal Singh Pratty of Jamalpur, Krishna Sahni of Sector 32 of the Chandigarh road.Nikka Jattana had taken the responsibility of attack through a Facebook post on Wednesday.

13-06-2020||City||Anti-malaria workers threaten strike over better salary, insurance||New Delhi:Anti-malaria workers of Delhi’s three municipal corporations, who are tasked with the work of spraying disinfectants amid the Covid-19 pandemic, have threatened to go on strike from June 25 if their demands related to free monthly check-ups, life insurance of Rs 50 lakh and an increment in their stipend were not met.Representatives of the workers’ association said their colleagues -- at least four employees tested positive -- had contracted Covid-19 but no help was provided by the civic agencies in terms of monetary help or treatment. Anti-malaria workers comprise domestic breeding checkers (DBC), contractual field workers (CFW) and contractual anti-malaria inspectors. The three corporations employ nearly 8,000 to 10,000 contractual and permanent anti-malaria workers.According to civic officials, contractual employees are generally deployed for anti-larva spraying, fogging and fumigation in residential and market areas to control the spread of mosquitoes. They also visit households and check breeding of mosquitoes. But ever since the Covid-19 outbreak, they have been tasked with the work of spraying disinfectants.Om Prakash Panchal, general secretary, Anti-Malaria Chaturth Shreni Union, said that during the pandemic, anti-malaria workers have been deployed in containment zones to perform “dangerous” task of sanitising those areas along with households. Panchal said the civic bodies should provide life insurance of Rs 50 lakh for each anti-malaria worker who joined after April 1, 2020, and conduct monthly health check-ups.These employees, both contractual and permanent, do not have any insurance cover.“We are frontline workers in the fight against Covid-19. We were deployed in hots pots to sanitise these areas. We perform our duties risking our lives but we don’t have any life insurance. There are no health check-ups for us. We will go on strike from June 25 if our demands are not considered. We have already written to the authorities of all the three civic bodies but to no avail,” Panchal said.Panchal said contractual workers are paid between Rs 15,000 and Rs 18,000, which is a meagre amount and should be increased. During lockdown, we spent all this stipend to commute to our work areas so that the sanitisation exercise is not affected. We cannot survive with such a low income. It should be doubled at least for the period till the Covid-19 situation is normalised,” he said.Jai Prakash, standing committee chairperson in North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said, “These workers are like our spine. They have played a very important role in carrying out sanitising exercises in containment zones. We had conducted Covid-19 checkups of all our employees and if anyone is left, we will ensure that they are covered. We had discussed their demands with the commissioner and will solve their problems as soon as possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/anti-malaria-workers-threaten-strike-over-better-salary-insurance/story-rAMtukF7qSQTm8yr4EBEFI.html
13-06-2020||Chandigarh||Residents movement in and out of Ludhiana containment zone goes unchecked||A day after the Habib Ganj, Sansi Mohalla and Islam Ganj areas of the city were declared part of the city’s second containment zone, free movement of residents was witnessed in the areas in the absence of any checks on Saturday. A visit to the areas revealed that not even a single police official was deputed at the entry and exit point and residents were moving about freely. Besides, non-essential shops were also found to be open and children were playing on the roads. On enquiry, residents said the security men deployed in the area may have gone for a break.Manjot Singh, a shopkeeper in Islam Ganj area, said, “The authorities have put up barricades near the house of the person whose cousin tested positive. But we have not been told anything about the restriction on movement or opening of shops. The barricading and announcement regarding the containment zone has only left residents in a state of panic.” Sunil, a resident of the area, said, “Though most residents are themselves not moving out of their house due to fear of catching the infection, the absence of checks at the entry and exit point is a cause of worry. Even the barriers installed at the entry and exit points is of no use as residents are moving about freely despite this. The administration should deploy a force on a permanent basis to impose the restrictions.”From Chhawani Mohalla, the city’s first containment zone, too similar complaints had been coming in, with many saying that the authorities lackadaisical attitude is set to prove fatal for the residents.Meanwhile, in Prem Nagar area, adjoining Islam Ganj, 10 residents, who returned from Mumbai, were sent to quarantine centres. Their reports are still awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/residents-movement-in-and-out-of-ludhiana-containment-zone-goes-unchecked/story-TnY4Kh4ZHh3EuCHM7KVXMI.html

13-06-2020||City||Delhi: Cash collection agent shot at, robbed of ₹2.5 lakh||New Delhi: A 35-year-old cash collection agent was shot at and robbed of ₹2.5 lakh by motorcycle-borne assailants in north Delhi’s Wazirabad on Friday afternoon. The agent suffered the bullet wound in his arm and was taken to a hospital where he was treated for his wound, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Monika Bhardwaj said that the victim, Rakesh Mishra, was returning after collecting payments in the Chandni Chowk area for his employers when the robbers waylaid him and tried to rob him.“Mishra resisted, after which the assailants fired a bullet at him, which hit his arm. The robbers then fled with his bag containing around ₹2.5 lakh. A case has been registered and teams are working on it,” said DCP Bhardwaj.Police said that Mishra works for a factory owner in Bawana and lives with his family in Budh Vihar near Rohini.

They would even make fake email ids and WhatsApp numbers and convince people to send the money to them,” said Meenakshi Katyayan, deputy commissioner of police (crime).Police said that the suspects were allegedly using Hari’s bank account for the transactions and the money was being divided among the three in equal shares. Jain had met Pankaj at a job fair some time back and due to financial problems, the three decided to go ahead with the fraud, the police said.“The bank accounts have been frozen and Rs 1.5 lakh of customers’ money has been traced.

After directions from the top officials, the Ghaziabad health department sprung into action and initiated action at ground level. District health officials said that they initiated the containment activities on Saturday afternoon.According to members of the Kaushambi Apartments RWA (KARWA), the umbrella body of residents’ welfare associations in Kaushambi township, two residents from the locality have died of Covid-19 in Delhi during the past two days and four positive cases have emerged.“On Saturday, I called up the CM office and made the officers there aware about the situation in Kaushambi. They promised all help. Thereafter in the afternoon, the health department officials arrived and took up sanitization and containment exercises. Later in the day, I received another call from Lucknow and they asked about the progress. I told them that the work has started,” said VK Mittal, president of KARWA.The Kaushambi township is located near Delhi’s Anand Vihar border and home to about 20,000 people.“The high-rises were not sanitized and no containment exercises were taken up despite two deaths and four positive cases which have emerged during the week in different areas of Kaushambi. In the morning, I even contacted the divisional commissioner (Meerut) who said that she will be directing the local authorities to initiate works at the earliest,” Mittal said.Health officials said that teams have started the sanitization work in affected towers.“Our teams have taken up sanitization in affected towers and sampling of close contacts is also being taken. In one of the death cases, the family denied sampling as they said that patient was initially positive but had turned negative later on. However, sampling of family and close contacts in second death case is being taken up. Both the deaths have taken place in Delhi and we are awaiting formal cross notification from Delhi authorities,” said GK Mishra, district malaria officer.He said that the health department will soon issue recommendation of taking up containment of four towers and one house in Kaushambi.“In all, four towers and one house will be sealed as per the protocol. The recommendation of sealing will be issued by Saturday night. The rest of the process will be taken up by the magistrate concerned,” Mishra added.With the rising number of Covid-19 cases, different localities and high-rises in Ghaziabad have been placed under containment zones as part of sealing. There have been instances where residents have complained of delayed sealing and also delay in reopening of containment zones.When asked about the alleged delay, Dr NK Gupta, Ghaziabad’s chief medical officer, said, “Our teams are working round the clock to take up containment exercises. There may be some delays in instances, but we are getting a lot of help from locals and RWAs who apprise us about their issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-four-covid-19-cases-kaushambi-residents-dial-cm-office-to-initiate-containment-exercise/story-JOu6DJhTxtYz7GnDQ1y1dN.html

Twelve Covid-19 positive patients have so far lost their lives in the district so far. As a result, the district now has 359 active cases,” he said.The CMO further said out of 35 positive cases on Saturday, 19 persons were tested by private laboratories, while the remaining 16 were tested positive at government laboratories. “Of these 35 positives today, as many as 30 people have ILI (influenza-like illnesses),” he said.Dr Ohri further said that 13,066 samples have been collected in the district for testing so far. “Tests per million population in the district is at 6,221, which is much better than the national index of per million tests of 3,913.”He further said in the last 24 hours, 493 tests have been conducted in the district. “The district has started special campaign to collect maximum samples for detecting Covid-19 at the earliest and identify the high-risk patients. Sampling is being done in old age homes, orphanages, and urban slums. We have decided to focus on hospital staff, vendors, delivery boys, drivers, conductors, autorickshaw drivers, healthcare workers, and chemists for sampling,” he said. Giving details of 69 cross notified Covid-19 positive cases, the CMO said while 20 of them are from Delhi, one patient each is from Haryana, West Bengal, and Andhra Pradesh. “While 10 patients have duplicate entries in the log, the remaining 36 are from other districts of Uttar Pradesh, including 11 from Ghaziabad, eight from Bulandshahr, two each from Hapur and Aligarh and one from Agra,” he said.Ohri also said health camps were organised in 12 places in the district on Friday, including at Mamura, Nithari, Sarfabad, Harola, and sectors 8, 9 and 10. “A total of 663 patients were screened on Saturday and four of them, who had symptoms of fever, have been referred to the district hospital,” he said.Meanwhile, to give relief to patients in light of the rising mercury levels, Covid-19 hospitals in the district are making arrangements for installing individual air-conditioning units, .GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said as per the Covid-19 guidelines, hospitals can use window ACs, after getting the unit certified from a team of specialists from Agra. “Even for centralised ACs, the ducts must be separate. Sharda hospital and the Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital have already sent their requests to get the experts’ opinion about the dos and don’ts regarding the use of AC units in their isolation wards. I hope that very soon the ACs will be operational in these hospitals,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/with-35-new-cases-gb-nagar-s-count-reaches-865/story-7BrWHCKqoBcopJofLWHk9I.html
13-06-2020||City||Ghaziabad crosses mark of 600 Covid-19 cases but recovery rate over 60%||The total number of Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad crossed 600 on Saturday with the addition of 23 fresh cases. The district now has 604 cases. One death too was recorded on the day, taking the total death count in the district to 20.The new death was of a 60-year-old woman who had comorbid conditions. She died at the tertiary care hospital in Meerut.In June, 299 cases and 16 deaths were added to the district’s tally in the first 13 days. Till May 31, the district had only 305 total cases with four deaths. The first case was reported on March 5.The district recorded its first 100 cases in 61 days, the next 100 in 16 days, then down to 10 days for the next 100, following which it fell to six days to reach a total of 400. Two days later, on June 8, the case count crossed 500.The ministry of home affairs’s had earlier allowed the reopening of the economy under its unlock 1 guidelines on June 8. States, however, were permitted to take necessary restrictions as per their analysis to contain Covid-19.According to officials, the district has a recovery rate of about 62%, which is better than the national average of about 50%.“It is also better than the state average of about 60%.We have discharged 373 in all from different hospitals,” Dr NK Gupta, Ghaziabad chief medical officer, said.According to the report of the state surveillance officer, the state of UP till June 13 had total of 13118 Covid-19 cases and 7858 of the patients were discharged from different hospitals.“To deal with severe cases, we have initiated a severe acute respiratory infection ward at MMG Hospital where patients having such indictions are getting admitted. These are the cases which are getting critical and also leading to death. In another direction, we have asked our L-3 (tertiary care for critical patients) hospital to not refer patients to L-3 hospital at Meerut. In several cases, patients were declared brought dead in Meerut. So all patients requiring critical care will be treated at L3 hospital in Ghaziabad,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “Although we have 20 cases of death which have taken place so far, only nine deaths have actually taken place in our hospitals while nine have taken place at Meerut and one each in hospitals of Delhi and Noida. We are trying to treat our patients in Ghaziabad but there are cases when patients directly go to Meerut. So, we cannot do much in such cases.”Of the 23 cases which were added on Saturday included three cases each form Kaushambi and Khoda while two cases were reported from Vasundhara and one from Indirapuram besides other cases in different localities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-crosses-mark-of-600-covid-19-cases-but-recovery-rate-over-60/story-NmVAByn6OTSsepWLoEH5AP.html
13-06-2020||City||After Supreme Court order, administration focuses on containment zones in Vaishali, Khoda and Loni||A day after the Supreme Court directed the Ghaziabad district magistrate to ensure that national guidelines are followed with regard to the creation of containment zones, in connection with a petition filed by a Vaishali resident, the administration officials said that the sector scheme will continue in Khoda, Vaishali and Loni.The petition had challenged the sealing of Gateway Towers and the implementation of the administration’s sector scheme in Vaishali. Petitioner Mohammad Faizul Khan, a resident of the high-rise, had contended that the sector scheme finds no mention in the Unlock 1.0 guidelines of the Centre and should be abolished.“The directions of the court will be complied with. The sector scheme is a process or procedure through which the containment exercise is implemented by roping in a team of magistrates, medical staff and the police, etc. We will be taking into consideration the containment zones in each of the localities,” Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, said.“If we go by the containment zones norms, a majority of the areas in the three localities will be covered. More containment zones will be chalked out in the future due to the rise in the Covid-19 cases,” he added.According to the latest list of containment zones available with the health department till June 9, the Ghaziabad district has a total of 217 containment zones, with 188 under category-1 and 29 under category-2.Category-1 containment zones comprise those areas which have a single Covid-19 case and the area of containment zone has a radius of 250 metres or covers the entire mohalla, whichever is less.Category-2 containment zones comprise areas with more than one case, covering a radius of 500 metres and an additional 250 metres as a buffer.“If we add up the areas covered by the different containment zones, a majority of Vaishali, Khoda and Loni will be included. Even if a particular area is not declared a containment zone and its residents move out, they will have to pass through the radius area of a containment zone nearby. So, their movement will be restricted,” an officer from the district health department said on condition of anonymity.According to officials, a containment zone will be scrapped within 14 to 21 days in case no more cases emerge from there. The administration had implemented the sector scheme in wake of the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Khoda, Vaishali and Loni.According to the list of containment zones, Vaishali has 13 zones under category-1 and three under category-2. Khoda comprises 30 different category-1 zones and two category-2 zones. Loni has eight category-1 zones and five category-2 containment zones.The sector scheme was implemented in Khoda, Loni and Vaishali on May 10, May 27 and June, respectively. Lately, however, the administration has relaxed some restrictions in Vaishali and Khoda—markets have been allowed to open up.“The worst part about the sector scheme is the restriction on the movement of Vaishali residents towards Delhi. After the Supreme Court order, the administration might release a revised order. Once they roll out the revised directions, we will decide upon the future course of action,” said Mohammad Faizul Khan, the petitioner in the case.The officials of the health department said that two engineers on Saturday have been roped in and will submit a report to the district magistrate.“The engineers will take stock of the containment zones based on active cases and other parameters and will submit a report to the district magistrate. Their report will determine how much of localities such as Vaishali and Khoda can be placed under containment,” said another officer from the health department on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-supreme-court-order-administration-focuses-on-containment-zones-in-vaishali-khoda-and-loni/story-V4ki4Y6uOjVNpamLriW3RI.html
13-06-2020||City||Noida: Mercury to remain below 40 degrees C over next two days||Noida: The city witnessed light rains on Saturday afternoon, bringing down the maximum temperature by two degrees Celsius, officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. With scattered rains likely to continue over the next two days, IMD has expected mercury to remain below 40 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature on Saturday was recorded at 39.4 degrees Celsius, the season’s average, against 41.5 degrees a day earlier. The minimum temperature was 30.2 degrees Celsius, against 29 degrees a day earlier.“There is a trough line, which is a low pressure line, passing through Punjab and Odisha via Haryana. There is also cyclonic circulation over Punjab and Haryana, which is causing thundery activities over the region. These activities lead to light rains and thundershowers that will continue till Monday leading to patchy rains across NCR, including Noida and Ghaziabad, at different time,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.According to the weather department, while the monsoon is moving towards the region at its normal pace and is expected to hit Noida, Ghaziabad and other areas of western Uttar Pradesh by June 27, thundery activities will continue to keep the temperature under check.“Temperature will not rise much, and is expected to remain under 40 degrees Celsius. It will oscillate between 38 to 40 degrees Celsius, of next two days at least. The on and off rainfall would keep the mercury under control,” Srivastava said.“The monsoon has already covered certain parts of Bihar and is moving at a favourable speed. We expect it to reach Delhi by June 27 and in 90% of the cases the time of monsoon’s arrival in Delhi is the same for Noida and rest of the western Uttar Pradesh,” he added..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-mercury-to-remain-below-40-degrees-c-over-next-two-days/story-xEtJhaHU7r6BuKwn4i5zVL.html
13-06-2020||City||Doctors, other staff found ‘partying’ inside OT of MMG hospital, inquiry initiated||Ghaziabad: The administration of MMG district hospital has constituted a committee to inquire into allegations that several doctors and health care staff members of the hospital were allegedly ‘partying’ inside the operation theatre (OT). The MMG hospital is presently a non-Covid government facility located in Ghaziabad city. Dr Anurag Bhargava, chief medical superintendent (CMS) of the hospital, said that he initiated an inquiry after receiving a written complaint from one of the doctors of the hospital.“After a complaint by the doctor, I have constituted an inquiry that should bring out all the facts. Prima facie, it has come to light that the event was held at a doctor’s room and not inside the OT. In the room, the doctors and staff generally have tea and snacks during the duty hours,” Bhargava said.According to hospital sources, certain photographs of the event, which took place on June 10, were also captured.According to the sources, the event was held in presence of Dr Ravinder Rana, former CMS of the hospital, who had recently been transferred to Etah and had come to the hospital on Wednesday to collect some pending documents. The sources said that the event was held for farewell of the former CMS.However, Rana has denied the allegation. “When I met the staff, they urged me to have tea and snacks in the pre-anesthesia checkup room. Generally, the health care staff members during the duty hour take breaks to have tea or snacks in the room. There was no outside person present in the room. It seems that someone tried to exaggerate the matter and submitted a complaint,” Rana said.Meanwhile, authorities of the L2 Covid hospital at Sanjay Nagar have written to the chief medical officer (CMO) that all the eight ventilators, including five previous ones, were made functional and now ready for use during the treatment of Covid patients.During an inspection earlier this week, state observer Dr VK Sonkar had found that none of the eight ventilators was used by the hospital authorities. The three out of eight are new and provided by the UP government for treatment of Covid-19 positive patients.“The ventilators have been made functional, and I will take up one more inspection in some days to assess whether patients are being treated through the ventilators or not. A report about the inspection has been submitted to the district magistrate and he will call for the explanation that why the ventilators were not being used,” Sonkar said.The state observer is sent by the UP government for regular inspections of Covid and non-Covid hospitals in Ghaziabad and point out any shortcomings in the health care facilities.Dr Naresh Vij, chief medical superintendent of the Sanjay Nagar hospital, did not respond to several calls.The state observer on Saturday said that he also inspected L1 category hospital at Nandgram and found that one of four ventilators deployed there was not functional.“I have asked them to get it operational while three were found operational during the inspection. The hospital has 10 oxygen cylinders and I have asked them to rope in five more. The chief medical officer has also been apprised and he will help out in arrangement,” Sonkar said.The L1 category hospital at Nandgram with 60 beds for Covid patients was made operational earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/doctors-other-staff-found-partying-inside-ot-of-mmg-hospital-inquiry-initiated/story-fBQNP2NRv6rl2nX70Jt7CL.html
13-06-2020||Mumbai||HCQ not banned by ICMR, can’t stop doctors from using drug: HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday, refrained from passing orders against the alleged indiscriminate administration of the Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) drug to slum dwellers on the grounds that it is the only drug which doctors are using as a last resort to treat patients. In its detailed order pertaining to various issues raised in seven public interest litigations (PIL), the court held that though there is no clinical proof to show that the drug was effective in combating Covid-19, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had not banned the use of the drug, and therefore it could not restrain doctors prescribing it as a prophylaxis (preventive treatment).The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Amjad Sayyed, while hearing the PIL filed by Jan Swasthya Abhiyaan, had been informed by senior advocate Mihir Desai that people living in the slums of Dharavi and Worli had been used as test subjects to study the viability of HCQ as a possible deterrent/antidote to the virus.Desai had submitted that it was alarming as the drug was known to cause diarrhoea and, considering the lack of water and toilets in slums, the administration of the drug to slum dwellers would only aggravate the problem.Desai had further submitted that the action of the state to subject some people to HCQ was without their consent, which was against the principles of democracy. He also pointed out that the trials were being conducted without the consent of the ICMR and hence, the authorities should be asked to submit details of the trials, their results, and outcomes. In light of these submissions, Desai had sought a restraint on the authorities from conducting the tests and trials.However, the state had submitted that the use of HCQ was recommended by the National Task Force (NTF) for Covid- 19 as a prophylaxis against the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, for selected individuals and hence, there was nothing wrong in it being administered to select groups in Dharavi and Worli.Desai in his reply to the state’s averments had submitted that the Ministry of Home and Family Welfare (MoHFW) guidelines on Covid-19 specified that HCQ was not recommended for children below the age of 12 years and pregnant and lactating women. He also noted that the Directorate of Medical Education Research (DMER) had no such restriction. Rather, it permitted the use of the drug on children prior to their being shifted to the ICU. Desai had submitted that as DMER was silent on protocols for the usage of HCQ, the state should be restrained from administering it indiscriminately.After considering both arguments, the court observed that Desai’s submission could not be ignored. “One cannot turn a blind eye to the present situation and wait for the lengthy process laid down in the statute for trials to be completed,” the court said.“Now, in a given case, if abiding by the law stricto sensu and waiting for a clinical trial of a drug would result in loss of valuable time for saving a patient and the choice is between the devil and the deep sea, i.e, no other drug except an HCQ sort of a drug, though not clinically tried for treating the disease, is the last option left for a doctor to save the life of such patient, should the doctor fold his hands and leave the patient to the mercy of the Almighty on the ground that the relevant drug has not been registered for use as prophylaxis? The answer, we are minded to hold, should be in the negative.”The HC bench pointed out that the guidelines of the ICMR have not banned the use of HCQ as prophylaxis to treat Covid-positive patients and said that reports have shown that the physical harm caused by the administration of HCQ outweighs its benefits.The court held that it was reluctant to interfere with policy decisions taken by the government in matters of public health and concerning whether a particular drug ought to be banned or not.In light of the fact that the MoHFW guidelines had restricted the administration of HCQ to children and pregnant women, the court said that it should not be administered to children below the age of 15 years and pregnant and lactating women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hcq-not-banned-by-icmr-can-t-stop-doctors-from-using-drug-hc/story-NyhN43b7DSeQe8pFwmMVEK.html

On June 6, the report revealed he was Covid positive. He was also suffering from diabetes. It is yet to be ascertained how he contracted the virus” said senior inspector Dharnendra Kamble.“The constable was on ventilator for a long period, but he succumbed around 11.10pm on Friday. He lived in Goregaon police colony with his wife, son and daughter and mother,” said a police officer.A police inspector from the same station had earlier tested positive but he is now healthy and is home quarantined, the officer added.Among the three other police personnel who died was a constable attached with Borivali police station. “He started having breathing problem and high fever from June 2, prompting him to stop going to work. He was admitted to a hospital at Nalla Sopara and his report came positive on June 6,” said Dr Mohan Dahikar, deputy commissioner of police, zone 11.The constable was a fit cop, said one of his colleagues. He was a resident of Vasai and lived with his parents, wife and a daughter.Similarly, 57-year-old head constable attached with Vakola police station also died due to the disease. Inspector Pravin Rane from Vakola police station said, “He was on leave since April as the police commissioner has exempted constables above 55 years from duty. On Friday, he suddenly developed breathing problem and was immediately taken to Niron Hospital for treatment. He succumbed on Saturday morning and the doctor told us he died of Covid-19,” Said Rane.The constable, a resident of Bandra (West), was set to retire on June 30. He lived with his two children, wife and an elderly mother.Another cop, a 56-year-old assistant sub-inspector (ASI) attached to the protection and security department of the city police, died due to Covid-19. He was posted at the office of the joint commissioner of police (law and order), but was on official leave due to his age.“On June 4, he was admitted to DY Patil Hospital after he complained of high fever. Test report revealed that he was Covid positive. He was on ventilator support since then and on Saturday at around 8am he succumbed to the disease,” said a police officer.The ASI lived with his wife and son in Navi Mumbai. At present, 516 infected police personnel are being treated in different Covid care centres across the city while 224 are admitted at hospitals. Of the total of 2,028 police personnel who tested positive, 290 are officers while the rest 1,738 are from constabulary. Of the total cases, 1,233 police personnel have recovered and 334 of the recovered policemen have joined duty.The state government has promised to give the family of deceased policemen a compensation of ₹50 lakh.

The cameras have been introduced at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT). “The thermal cameras can cover large areas. It can detect the temperature of multiple people entering at once and record temperature automatically while passengers are on the move,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relation officer, CR. The infrared cameras will also screen on-duty railway officials at CSMT and LTT railway stations.CR recently introduced digital screens at Nagpur railway station and robotic system at Pune railway stations to conduct thermal screenings of passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/central-railway-sets-up-infrared-cameras-at-csmt-ltt/story-0G1gd0NeZVGLWBL2BQKVBI.html
13-06-2020||Gurugram||Unlocking Gurugram: In 11 days, city witnessed 2,148 cases||Gurugram has witnessed a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases after lockdown restrictions began to be eased on May 18, with around 92.5 percent of the district’s total cases as of Saturday emerging since then .A sharper surge has been seen in the last 11 days alone, during the first phase of a nationwide ‘unlocking’, with 71.7 percent of the district’s total cases emerging during this time.From 204 positive cases being detected between March 4 and May 17, Gurugram’s total tally rose to 774 by May 31. The tally further kept climbing, with at least 2,922 Covid-19 positive cases being registered till June 12Despite the alarming numbers, experts and officials insisted that there was a need to reopen Gurugram’s economy, where major industries — particularly automobiles, IT, pharmaceuticals — are concentrated.Rohit Prasad, an economist and professor at Gurugram’s Management Development Institute, said, “The economic fallout of the lockdown has been unprecedented. There is really no alternative to reviving the local economy, except for allowing people to go to work. Most people in India do not have the luxury of working from home.” He added that Gurugram, as the largest urban agglomeration in Haryana, generates a lion’s share of the state’s revenue (close to 60%), and is also its largest employer in both formal and informal sectors. Any further restrictions on movement will mar their employment prospects, and Gurugram’s financial revival,” Prasad added. Ramping up testing, surveillance is imperativeThe need to open up poses two major challenges for Gurugram’s Covid-19 response. The first is an urgent need to increase testing capabilities, and the second is to increase the number of available field staff for contact tracing and isolation of patients, according to Gurugram’s newly appointed chief medical officer, Dr Virender Yadav. “Before lockdown, things in Gurugram were under control. From late April to mid-May, Gurugram’s contribution to the national case load was not very high, unlike Delhi, Mumbai, or Ahmedabad. The surge has happened post lockdown, but other parts of the country are facing this issue too. We cannot remain under lockdown indefinitely,” Yadav said. Gurugram’s rising Covid-19 cases are reflected in a range of data-points, from its quick doubling-rate (7 days), to its test-positivity rate (which stands at an all time high of 44.4 percent for June, so far), along with a high daily growth-rate of cases (about 10 percent), and a declining recovery rate (due to an increasing daily case load). “Our test positivity rate is extremely high, which rules out any option of pooled testing. A high test-positivity rate also indicates that we may not be testing enough people. So, we need to meet the increase in number of cases with more tests. This is my first priority. We have conducted a trial of 40 samples in Gurugram on Thursday, and by next week the lab here should be testing 200 samples per day,” Yadav said. Dr Prabhakaran Dorairaj, vice president (research & policy), at the Public Health Foundation of India, also emphasised the need to ramp up testing in light of new cases which have emerged post-lockdown. “The more cases you find, the more primary contacts you will need to trace and test. So naturally, increasing that capacity at this stage is imperative. Another cause of concern is the strain on the healthcare system. Authorities need to ensure that those who can stay at home are able to do so, and will need to deploy a larger workforce to trace and isolate positive cases,” he said. Keeping mortality rate low is keyA senior official in Haryana’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Program explained that, without adequately ramping up testing and without strengthening field surveillance, the district may possibly see a rise in case fatality rate, which is so far much lower than other severely hit districts. “Our surveillance is strong because we have been able to detect cases early and have been able to treat them. As numbers rise, we need more tests and better field surveillance with more officers so that we can continue to achieve this. Without a combination of these two, the danger is that upcoming cases will either go undetected, or may be detected too late. This would lead to a higher mortality rate. We are working to avert such a scenario,” said the official. However, available reports suggest that such adverse consequences are already starting to emerge in the district. Of the 19 deaths registered in Gurugram so far, 15 occurred in the last five days. Of these, three of the victims had passed away before they could reach Civil Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/unlocking-gurugram-in-11-days-city-witnessed-2-148-cases/story-DYwS5ocJvROKA4ikfa5BfL.html
13-06-2020||Mumbai||Waterlogging spots rise to 336; BMC readies dewatering pumps||Mumbai’s waterlogging spots have increased to 336 from 273 during last year’s monsoon. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), however, said it has taken preventive steps at 266 spots, while work was in progress at the remaining 70 spots. While some of the major flood-prone spots in the island city are Geeta Nagar, Ambedkar Nagar, Sandhurst Road, Nana Chowk, Matunga, Parel TT, Hindamata, Gandhi Market, Janata Colony and Dhobi Ghat, for the eastern suburbs, they are LBS Road, Shell Colony, Tilak Nagar, Mankhurd Subway, Deonar Abbatoir, Shanti Campus.There will be 120 dewatering pumps functional to pump out water into the stormwater drain system in the island city. Two of the pumps will be set up at KEM Hospital and Sion Hospital, both major Covid facilities, located near low-lying areas. In the eastern suburbs, the civic body has identified 100 dewatering pumps.Major flood-prone spots in western suburbs are Kala Nagar, Khar subway, Milan subway, Andheri-Kurla Road, Shastri Nagar, Malad subway, Poisar subway, Borivli subway, and Dahisar subway. The BMC has planned to use 105 dewatering pumps for these spots.According to municipal commissioner IS Chahal, BMC has identified a total of 336 flooding spots in the city — 125 in the island city, 97 in the eastern suburbs and 124 in the western suburbs. Of these, 54 are localised flooding spots. So far, he said, BMC has tackled 266 flooding spots and is in the process of tackling 70 others before monsoon kicks in over the next few days.Over the past five years, the flooding spots in Mumbai have increased from 40 in 2014, to 273 in 2019. During the municipal commissioner’s budget speech of 2014-15, he had listed 40 flooding spots. However, in the budget speech of 2017-18, the number increased to 66, and in 2018-19, they were upped to 146. However, before the monsoon of 2018, BMC declared that there were 225 flooding spots, and the number further shot up to 273 after 48 flooding spots were added to the list during the monsoon of 2018.In February 2020, the BMC budget, presented by the then civic chief Praveen Pardeshi, listed 273 waterlogging spots for the city, of which work on 69 was pending.Meanwhile, BMC has also installed 2,772 protective grills under manhole covers across Mumbai, of which 2,008 are in the island city, 203 in the western suburbs, and 399 in the eastern suburbs. In 2017, renowned doctor Deepak Amrapurkar died after falling down an open manhole near Elphinstone. It was later investigated that a local had removed the manhole cover to quicken the pace of water draining out of a waterlogged street. Following this, BMC had decided to install protective grills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/waterlogging-spots-rise-to-336-bmc-readies-dewatering-pumps/story-JspIVew187Jxfg4sUw0oaN.html
13-06-2020||City||MCG shuffles 37 senior officials||Gurugram: In a major administrative move, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has effected a shuffle of 37 senior officials, including additional commissioners, joint commissioners and senior sanitation inspectors. MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh passed six different orders in this regard on late Friday night. The orders resulted in senior MCG officials such as additional commissioners, joint commissioners, senior sanitation inspectors, zonal taxation officers, assistant engineers, and junior engineers either being moved to a new zone or given a new task entirely. Although such rejig in the MCG is not rare, it is done in a phased manner. “The rationale behind shuffling and assigning new duties to MCG staff members is to make them familiar with different scope of civic issues faced in the city, so that they can use both their past and present experiences to deal with such matters in the best possible way. This will ensure that civic operations are more streamlined,” said the MCG commissioner.Jaspreet Kaur, additional commissioner of zone 4, has been appointed as the nodal officer for dealing with issues related to the biodiversity park and reuse of recycled water. Surender Kumar, additional commissioner of zone 1, is now the nodal officer for water and sewerage billing issues, septage management, sewerage treatment plants, 900-metre ammunition depot restricted area, and property tax. Similarly, Amardeep Jain, additional commissioner of zone 2, has been tasked with the responsibility of overseeing all types of grievances filed against the MCG, and also streetlight management. Inderjit Kularia, joint commissioner (headquarters), is the nodal officer for plastic shredding plant and its usage in road construction, while chief engineer ND Vashisht is the nodal officer for the C&D waste plant at Basai.In the enforcement wing, four assistant engineers and six junior engineers have been shuffled to different zones. At the advertisement wing, new assistant engineer and two junior engineers have been deputed to look after MCG’s all four zones. Eight outsourced junior engineers have been given the responsibility of providing assistance to executive engineers in all eight divisions of the engineering branch until September for dealing with waterlogging related issues. As per the orders, they will have to each day submit photos of waterlogging stretches and also mark out such areas on a map and submit the file to their respective executive engineers who can then get the drains cleaned.The positions of two zonal taxation officers in MCG’s zones 2 and 4 have been swapped. All seven staff members of the MCG’s sanitation branch, including senior sanitary inspectors, sanitary officer, and sanitary inspectors, have been reshuffled to different zones.Mahender Singh, city project officer (CPO), has been given additional charge of assisting Jaspreet Kaur with all works pertaining to coronavirus.Apart from the six orders, the MCG commissioner also issued two more orders on Friday night, chalking out the standard operating procedure to be followed by officials for streetlights and water supply management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mcg-shuffles-37-senior-officials/story-BDM1Hr32MJ384Eu1DUEJwJ.html
13-06-2020||Mumbai||HC junks PILs on temporary accommodation for Mumbai’s essential service staffers||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday upheld that humane approach is the need of the hour, while rejecting two public interest litigations (PILs), which had sought a direction to the authorities to provide temporary accommodation in Mumbai to the essential-service providers, who are battling the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, instead of travelling to their homes daily in far-off suburbs such as Vasai-Virar and Panvel.The petitioners had expressed fear that the daily commute could risk the lives of the residents of Vasai-Virar and Panvel municipal corporation areas because the essential-service providers are suspected to be the prime carriers of SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19. Virar resident Charan Bhatt and the member of the legislative assembly (MLA) from Panvel, Prashant Thakur, had filed the pleas in the court.A two-member division bench, comprising chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Amjad Sayed, however, refused to accept the petitioners’ contention.Earlier, the petitioners’ counsel, advocate Uday Warunjikar, had submitted that the concern expressed in the pleas was genuine and that the PILs were filed to safeguard the interest of the residents of Vasai-Virar and Panvel civic body areas. Warunjikar had cited that the essential-service employees formed a potent threat to other residents in these civic body areas.He prayed that the state authorities were duty-bound to provide temporary accommodation to the frontline workers near their workplaces in Mumbai.Maharashtra advocate-general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said the PILs revealed the petitioners’ insensitivity.He argued that when the frontline workers are engaged in combating Covid-19 and Maharashtra government has been trying their best to contain the spread of the virtual outbreak, the petitioners want to keep the essential-service staffers in isolation and ensure that they are denied the opportunity to return to their homes on completion of their hard day’s work. He termed the petitioners’ demand as “most unfortunate”.The state government also pleaded helplessness to provide temporary accommodation to the essential-service employees in Mumbai because of their high numbers.The bench accepted the state government’s submission. “Humane approach is the need of the hour,” it said.The court added: “Even if some of such staffers might have unfortunately been infected by Covid-19 that is no ground to ostracise them.”The court while disposing of the PILs made a scathing remark that the essential-service providers must be encouraged in discharging their duties without any fear or favour amid these hard times triggered by the viral outbreak.The court hoped that the frontline workers would take the utmost care to protect themselves from the viral infection and also safeguard their family members by exercising caution and restrain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-junks-pils-on-temporary-accommodation-for-mumbai-s-essential-service-staffers/story-0yBfDI4nI5JAH5MA1oxgHN.html
13-06-2020||Mumbai||‘Textile finishing dye turns Ulhas River water turquoise’||Despite the Supreme Court (SC) being apprised of high pollution levels in Ulhas and Waldhuni rivers, untreated effluents continue to be discharged by industries in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). An inspection report submitted in SC by the environment group Vanashakti, on Friday showed pollutant discharge at the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) area at Sonarpada, Dombivli, had turned the river water turquoise (see image) with foam. “Effluents are being discharged by industries at unauthorised locations entering stormwater drains and polluting a 1.5-km stretch of Ulhas. The violations are going unnoticed as there is the preferential treatment meted out to Dombivli MIDC textile and chemical industries,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti.Following this, a complaint was filed with the state environment department and Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) on Saturday. A stream passing through Dombivli was identified carrying effluents to the main channel, the complaint said.The Friday’s inspection also revealed that untreated industrial effluent discharge into the Waldhuni river by Ambernath MIDC and Anand Nagar Additional MIDC where a section of the river turned black. This is the same area where MPCB had issued closure notices to seven firms earlier this year for violating water pollution norms. “The brazenness of the polluters, backed by active support from state agencies, has killed the Ulhas and Waldhuni rivers,” added Stalin. MPCB said they initiated an investigation into the source of pollution. “On taking cognisance of the SC petitioner’s complaint, a team has been directed to undertake a site visit on Monday and submit a report on alleged violations. Necessary action will be taken based on the report,” said SL Waghmare, regional officer (Kalyan), MPCB.In May, a section of Waldhuni river had turned red due to water pollution forcing MPCB to issue a ₹5 lakh penalty on the Badlapur wastewater treatment plant. Ulhas and Waldhuni are among 53 of the most polluted rivers from Maharashtra, highest for any state among 351 most polluted rivers in India, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Ulhas supplies drinking water to over 30 lakh residents of the Badlapur-Thane belt.MIDC officers said they identified a textile industry in the belt using finishing dyes, and had released its effluents in the river. “The frequency of violations have risen. Only essential industries are being allowed to function, and this industry is not one of them. We will ask MPCB to action against this industry for violating norms,” said Kalidas Bandekar, MIDC superintendent engineer for MMR.Another Vanashakti member Nandkumar Pawar countered, “Despite repeated violations, there is mere lip service by authorities that action will be taken but nothing happens on the ground. Amid all this, MPCB has tripled the consented capacity of perennial violators.”During Friday’s inspection, common effluent treatment plant (CETP) at Dombivli and Ambernath were dysfunctional in curbing industrial waste. “Discharge of effluents is going on in broad daylight. The CETP is being bypassed and untreated effluents are being discharged into the stormwater drains,” said Stalin adding, “After seven years of fighting to save the Ulhas river, we have now realised that the MPCB has taken an adversarial stand to support the violating industries.”Ulhas river was much cleaner during lockdown: MPCBAs repeated complaints of water pollution from Ulhas and Waldhuni rivers pile up, the state pollution control board’s water quality assessment of Ulhas river showed that the water quality had improved during the lockdown. The water quality index reflected non-polluted status based on samples collected from six regions along the river. “Apart from a drop in industrial effluents, other activities such as the washing of vehicles, jeans washing units, service centres etc. all stopped improving Ulhas water quality,” said YB Sontakke, joint director, MPCB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/textile-finishing-dye-turns-ulhas-river-water-turquoise/story-vPDfGlKIAQGNS0g5yRAHUO.html

13-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana HC stays regularisation of services of part time, guest lecturers||The Punjab and Haryana high court has stayed regularisation of services of any part-time, ad hoc, or guest lecturers, and others recruited to the post of lectures other than by the regular selection process in Punjab colleges.The HC bench of justice Amol Rattan Singh also added that the state government will not resort to invoking any statute which allows regularisation of such services and issue letters to those working against such designations.The court acted on a plea which highlighted that regularisation of any person not recruited through the regular recruitment process as prescribed by the rules, should not be allowed.The order was passed as senior advocate Rajwinder Singh Bains told court that government is in the process of regularising the service of such people, whereas there are people seeking appointment by the way of regular selection after due advertisements for the posts.“Many such people are working against college cadre posts, where only Punjab Public Service Commission makes recruitments. However, for years, regular recruitment is not being made and these persons are being allowed to continue. Now, attempts are being made to regularise them,” Bains said.The matter is pending before court since 2011, when some petitioners had alleged that they are qualified for the post of lecturers as they fulfil all requisite qualifications but some of the employees, who are not even qualified, are being allowed to work.It was further alleged that the state has acted in a mala fide manner just to deprive the eligible to be appointed on posts for which they are qualified.Bains said that recently a committee had recommended that those working against such designations be regularised. The government was in the process of regularising the services after the recommendation. The petitioners had challenged a fresh attempt by the state to regularise these appointments, he said.The court, while fixing the matter for July 1, told the state’s counsel to convey the order to the authorities concerned immediately, and added that any non-compliance will be viewed as ‘contemptuous’. The order was passed on Wednesday and made available on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-and-haryana-hc-stays-regularisation-of-services-of-part-time-guest-lecturers/story-jBJgyiFR9s844lcx3XbT4H.html

13-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana HC allows filing of all types of cases||Almost three months after court functioning was restricted due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the Punjab and Haryana high court will resume filing of all types of cases from June 15. Lawyers can also file ‘ordinary cases’, where there is no urgency of hearing, but these cases will be taken up only after normal functioning of courts resume.On March 16, the HC had restricted court functioning and subsequently decided to take up ‘urgent cases’ only through video conferencing. Lawyers have been demanding that more cases should be allowed to be listed and physical hearing should be resumed.An HC official said that seven counters will be set up on the court complex where lawyers can file petitions. For this purpose, they will have to seek online appointment and a fixed time slot will be given. For law officers of both the states, Centre and Chandigarh, a separate counter has been established.The official added that objections, if any, in the petition will be notified when normal functioning of court resumes. As of the cases with some urgency where hearings are already taking place, there will be no change in the manner of filing.Last week, the HC had allowed trial courts to take up all types of cases. As of physical hearing of cases, which lawyers have been demanding, the high court is yet to finalise the protocol. A committee was set up on May 27, to suggest ways to allow physical hearing of cases. However, it is yet to come out with its recommendations.The panel headed by justice Rajiv Sharma is to deliberate on how to resume normal functioning and regulate entry in courts. It will further delve into the procedure for filing of cases, norms on social distancing, sanitisation and norms with regard to use of common facilities and air conditioning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-and-haryana-hc-allows-filing-of-all-types-of-cases/story-r1fn2wwN0Xk216NF5lWQUL.html
13-06-2020||Chandigarh||Let’s value the lessons we are being taught in the times of Covid-19||Despite Vision 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050 having burst like a bubble, it is amazing to see how man still finds it impossible to live in the present. Man by his innate nature is either lost in the past or daydreaming about the future. You can call it vision or planning, but the fact remains that there are times when everything goes topsy-turvy. If you have past wounds and scars, they too become insignificant and irrelevant. Amassed wealth, high positions, burning desires and ambitions – all lose their relative importance.Believe me, what matters is the present, and there’s a reason why an old saying also simply echoes as ‘No time like the present’. I can’t agree more. I find the present times to be unique, something that truly is in our own hands.Currently, we might be overwhelmed by the fear of coronavirus, but it’s still teaching us so much.It has already helped us slow down, to stand still and ultimately reach a balance in our lives. It has also given us time to ponder upon, reflect on and start valuing what really matters in life, without having to read any self-help book.In the last decade there has been a surge in self-management guides, spiritual gurus and pursuit of happiness, and now, time has suddenly taught us what’s really essential for a good life. The focus for a majority has moved to good health, peace and survival instead of materialistic pursuits. Each individual is worried about remaining healthy and alive now. Some are even paranoid. What is right? Do we become obsessed with the fear of Covid-19 or do we have a blind faith that nature will save us? Is it a divine plan or will science and technology come to our rescue? The questions are simple for those who believe in balance. The pandemic, however, proves that nature is the most powerful and yet we have to depend on science and technology to be rescued.Several paradoxical facts too have been revealed. Many youngsters addicted to social media have realised the importance of human connect. People who criticised technology are experiencing its benefits.The last few months have also taught us that the world will never be the same again, no matter what anyone’s nationality, colour, gender, creed and faith is.We have to agree that we are learning a new way of life which will become the new norm. Alfred, Lord Tennyson’s words, “The old order changeth, yielding place to new,” are so apt. Yet we don’t have to be scared that everything will come to an end. It is true; some will succumb to the battle. It is equally saddening to see the plight of the poor. It is not even appropriate to categorise the present situation as a boon or bane. We just have to be sensible, cautious, pragmatic and optimistic to sail through. Man no longer needs complicated philosophy for life. The post Covid-19 world will most probably follow what HW Longfellow said in The Psalm of Life:“Trust no Future, however pleasant! Let the dead Past bury its dead!Act, act in the living Present!Heart within and God o’erhead!”So let us learn all that we can from the lessons being taught to us now!gurvinderk2000@gmail.com(The writer is an English teacher at Punjab Public School, Nabha)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/let-s-value-the-lessons-we-are-being-taught-in-the-times-of-covid-19/story-yzAoWPfHQqntIip1DBZS3N.html
13-06-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: What’s in a name that we call sambar||The Sambar is the most widespread deer species of Asia and the largest of the Oriental deer. The occurrence of the Sambar is seemingly common enough in our region and its status does not attract the attention of wildlife conservationists and policy makers. Only poachers seem to pay an unwholesome attention to this species. In its natural state, birds such as the Cattle egret and Rufous treepie associate with Sambars by clinging to them and removing parasites from body parts such as the deer’s ears. The Sambar is also the stock prey of the tiger. But there is much more than meets the eye to the deer’s name, the Sambar’s seeming omnipresence and its perceived conservation status in India’s besieged wilderness.International scientists changed the scientific or zoological nomenclature of the Sambar from Cervus unicolor to Rusa unicolor to notify the change in genus. This means that while the common English or vernacular name of the species will vary according to the culture and linguistics of the regions where it is found in India, South Nepal, Sri Lanka, South China and South-east Asia, the scientific nomenclature remains the same, Rusa unicolor. For example, in India the deer takes its common name, Sambar, from the South Indian vegetable stew with a mix of spices as the deer’s pelt resembles the colour of that popular dish while in Nepal it is referred to as the Jarao and in China as the Four-eyed deer.The complications start when we find that the scientific nomenclature of the deer remains unchanged in the official records and wildlife protection laws of India, which persist with the outdated, genus-wrong and taxonomically-incorrect, Cervus unicolor. Not only that, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has placed the species as a “vulnerable” one in its Red List primarily due to its poaching for meat. However, India’s Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, persists with a decades-old placing of the Sambar under Schedule III, which does not reflect the IUCN’s heightened concern over its diminishing population. The IUCN estimated the Sambar to have declined globally by more than 50%. However, the evaluation of the Sambar’s conservation status in India will require an appraisal of numbers, declines and distributions specific to India as the IUCN’s “Vulnerable” status is global in coverage and spans several nations with differing variables on the Sambar’s status. The above discrepancies between Indian laws and an international evaluation of the Sambar’s scientific classification and its contemporary vulnerability were noticed by former Punjab chief wildlife warden and a current member of the IUCN’s Commission on Education and Communication, Gurmit Singh. “Our laws need to be amended to bring them in line with the international standards on the Sambar. I wrote to the IUCN’s SSC co-chair of the Deer Specialist Group, Dr Naom Werner. I then brought my correspondence on the above subject with the IUCN to the notice of the Punjab chief wildlife warden, who has promised to take up the issue with Union ministry of environment and forests, which alone can introduce the required amendments in legislation. A change or amendment in the scientific name will be helpful in Indian wildlife litigation involving Sambars, such as poaching or environmental clearance for diversion of Sambar habitats,” Singh told this writer.Responding to Singh’s query, the Jerusalem-based Dr. Naom Werner, wrote back explaining the change in scientific nomenclature from Cervus unicolor to Rusa Unicolor. “The sambar has had a turbulent nomenclatural history. While the genus name, Rusa, was already suggested in the mid-19th century, it has not been used continuously and the genus name, Cervus, was preferred until some 15 years ago (with Rusa sometimes being used as a sub-genus). Since 2005, the name, Rusa unicolor, has been in use and recent studies support this separation. I agree with you that following this change, national Acts (such as India’s) should be amended accordingly,” stated Dr. Werner in his email to Singh.Tailpiece: What’s in name? Plenty of controversy and confusion! It is Singh’s similar and painstaking efforts to get to the root of wildlife technicalities and seek clarifications from authorities on the subject that the puzzle over the change in the common name of Punjab’s State Bird was resolved. When the ‘Baaz’ was declared State Bird in 1989, it went by the common name of Eastern goshawk. Later, it was changed to Northern goshawk by international ornithologists. However, the Punjab government notification persisted with Eastern goshawk till a few years back leading to speculation that there were two distinct species, Eastern and Northern. A section of mediapersons and uninformed critics assailed the supposed “duplicity” of the Punjab Wildlife Preservation department.So, which one was the State Bird, Eastern goshawk or Northern goshawk? In stepped Singh, who wrote to a world-famous authority on the sub-continent’s raptors, Rishad Naoroji. He wrote back to Singh explaining that the scientific name remained one and the same (Accipiter gentilis) but since the Goshawk was primarily a bird of the northern latitudes, the common name had been correctly changed from Eastern to Northern goshawk! vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-what-s-in-a-name-that-we-call-sambar/story-aVBvl635VZZG7Sa49IeVLK.html

He added that the government reserves the right to withdraw land provided to these hospitals at concession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-health-minister-warns-of-action-against-pvt-hospitals-overcharging-covid-patients/story-ztPIdIDNwULgUNvONXsGTO.html
13-06-2020||City||Stringent checking of those coming from Delhi: Capt||Chandigarh Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday called for intensive checking of passengers and commuters coming from other states, particularly Delhi where the situation appears to be grave.During his Facebook Live #AskCaptain session, he said Punjabis in Delhi were welcome to come to the state for Covid-19 treatment after getting a referral and booking a hospital bed in advance.Amarinder said while Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh had sealed their borders with Punjab, people in large numbers from Haryana and Delhi were coming daily to the state. On Friday, 6,500 vehicles (roughly 20,000 people) entered Punjab from Delhi and Haryana, he said.“We are mulling more stringent entry norms, given the increasing number of positive cases in the state. Of the 2,986 cases in Punjab, 1,471 could be traced to outsiders and their contacts,” said the chief minister.He attributed the spike in cases to influx of people from outside the state and more testing. The CM said testing facilities will soon be made available in Pathankot and Gurdaspur.He said shooting of movies was permitted in the state and instructions to this effect have been issued to the DCs.Chief Minister also said by June 30 the Punjab government will take a decision on examinations by universities and colleges, in line with the fresh guidelines expected from the Centre.Follow restrictions, get rewarded Amarinder also announced a month-long `Mission Fateh Warriors’ campaign to reward citizens who are following diligently health advisories and norms.The CM said those following the norms stringently for four weeks will be eligible for a bronze certificate and a T-shirt; while T-shirts, along with silver and gold certificates will be given to those adhering to protocols, such as wearing of mask and maintaining social distancing, through the week and month respectively. All the certificates will bear personal signature of the chief minister.Registration for the same will begin on the COVA app from June 17, said the CM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stringent-checking-of-those-coming-from-delhi-capt/story-uFeM3Bhy96tekeVq4zYZwO.html
13-06-2020||Chandigarh||Guest Column: Fun, environmentally friendly and good for you, here’s how Chandigarh can become bicycle-friendly||Chandigarh roads were never designed for today’s heavy traffic and what’s to come in the future. Therefore, early action is called for to find ways and means to reduce vehicular traffic by developing alternate means of transportation. Many cities in the world have tried to limit the number of vehicles on roads, by developing mass transportation facilities such as metro rail and buses and encouraging carpooling and cycling – especially across short distances. In Chandigarh, some attempts have been made by the engineering wing of the UT administration to assist cyclists to cross over at light points which have been painted red.Repairs due alreadyIt has also been claimed that 70 km of new cycle tracks have been laid out, but some stretches are already in need of repairs. Proposals have also been made to light up a stretch of the track from the lake towards Madhya Marg at a cost of Rs 80 lakh. This amount can be better used to make new cycle tracks, While marking cycle tracks at crossings and light points is a good effort, these are mere ad hoc measures. Without well laid out tracks, these would be inadequate and unsafe and in no way promote cycling culture in the city.Cyclists must wear helmets and ensure their cycles have suitable reflectors at the rear and in the wheels. Lights are a must too for the night.The plan in Chandigarh to have 600 dock stations for 5,000 regular as well as battery operated cycles, has not fructified. This too requires a push. We have to make cycling in the city safe to the extent that parents can feel confident sending their children to schools on cycles. Fortunately, Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore is particularly keen to encourage people to take up cycling. He himself has tried to set an example and demonstrate that even as governor he prefers to cycle.To put such a scheme in operation, what is called for is a comprehensive plan for layout of cycle tracks within and in between sectors, integrating traffic lights with the movement of cycles. At some spots one side of the road could be dedicated only for cycles.In some places cycle tracks can be segregated by putting up railings. The location of dock stations for cycles and their hiring too needs to be worked out with due diligence.Give the job to engineering colleges The task of working out a comprehensive plan for cycle tracks, location of ‘dock stations’ and integration of traffic lights with the movement of cycles at traffic light points can be given to a few engineering colleges. They can field teams of four to five students working on a two-month deadline. The best and acceptable plan could be offered a prize of Rs 10 lakh. Such plans should address cycling within sectors and inter-sector movement, as also between Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula. To encourage children to take to cycling, a track around the lake should be laid out, a few hundred cycles made available with Sundays and holidays dedicated for the purpose. To this end, the Chandigarh administration should work out a plan to lay a safe cycling track around the lake including bridges for cycles over various streams that flow into the lake. To reduce up and down traffic between Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali, besides a metro rail (which will take time) a large number of small buses (deluxe class – preferably electric ) with capacity range of 10 to 12 passengers should be inducted. Their routes should be carefully worked out across sectors. Small buses will not crowd the roads and also be acceptable to car owners. To that end, vehicle owners too should be encouraged to use the buses for inter-city movement. As a disincentive for using own cars, parking charges should be substantially increased and parking along roads stopped.The proposal to transform Chandigarh into a cycle friendly city needs to be taken up on priority and it should serve as a model for most other towns of Punjab to emulate. genharwant@gmail.com(The writer is a former deputy chief of army staff and commentator on defence and security matters.

13-06-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: Panjab University has miles to go after NIRF rankings||The Union human resource development ministry’s National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) announced on Thursday did not bring good news for one of north India’s top universities: Panjab University (PU) was 10 positions down from rank 34 to 44 among educational institutes in the country.PU’s ranking among universities too slipped from 21 in 2019 to 26 this year, a very poor performance for an institute that in 2016 was ranked 12 among all universities.PU’s scores in all vital parameters dropped – in teaching, learning and resources, including total student strength, faculty-student ratio and financial resources, it scored 50.08 as against 51.09 in 2019.Scores dropped in research and professional practice as well to 42.83 against last year’s 44.82. This parameter includes the varsity’s patents both published and granted, combined metric for publication and footprints of projects.PU also didn’t do too well in graduation outcome; outreach and inclusivity, and perception. Graduation outcome includes metric for university exams and number of PhD students graduated. Outreach and inclusivity includes percentage of students from other states and countries; woman students, economically and socially challenged students and facilities for disabled students.The top three universities in the rankings were Indian Institute of Science Bangalore, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and Banaras Hindu University (BHU).Interestingly enough, though PU slipped 13 notches in the eighth edition of Times Higher Education Asia University Rankings 2020, missing a spot in the top 100, it was placed higher than University of Delhi, which was at the 155th spot; as well as JNU and BHU, putting a question mark over how the rankings are arrived at.Nonetheless, with PU grappling for some years with a financial crunch and facing strong opposition from students to its proposed 7.5 % fee hike in self-financed courses and 5% in all traditional courses for the new entrants, any chance of the institute getting its act together to revamp its departments and taking immediate measures to improve upon its research output looks bleak.With the Covid-19 lockdown, economy on the downswing and no clarity on exam date – everything at present seems to be going against the university.That said, however, nothing can stop PU’s highly qualified faculty, its strong alumni network as well as student bodies from putting their heads together and figuring out a course of action for the future.Special incentives for researchers, more stress on getting research grants, pushing for additional funding from the Centre or even a relief package are a number of steps that can be taken immediately to help PU improve its position among universities in India.POOR SHOWCan PU power up its performance?What does Panjab University need to do to improve its performance in global and Indian rankings?

13-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt asks all hospitals to share Covid-19 treatment charges amid high cost buzz||Amid a social media buzz over high cost of coronavirus treatment at a private facility, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday said the government has sought fee details from all hospitals and will decide on “what to do” after overall observation. The rate card of Max Hospital had gone viral on social media on Friday with many users noting that the charges were too high for a common man. The rate card showed that the facility was charging Rs 72,000 for an ICU with ventilator. On its part, Max Healthcare, which runs the facility, said the viral rate card did not carry “all the facts such as inclusions of routine tests, routine medicines, doctor and nurse charges”. Asked about capping fees being charged by private hospitals for Covid-19 treatment on Saturday, Jain said, “All the hospitals have been asked to share the rates that they are charging for Covid treatments. We will decide on what to do after observing every hospital.” Delhi recorded 2,137 fresh coronavirus cases on Friday, the highest single-day spike here, taking the Covid-19 tally in the city to over 36,000-mark, and the death toll due to the disease climbed to 1,214, authorities said. After its rate card went viral, Max Healthcare tweeted, “A picture related to the pricing of Covid treatment at Max Patparganj (stated in some tweets as Max Gurgaon) is being circulated on social media. However, it did not carry all the facts such as inclusions of routine tests, routine medicines, doctor and nurse charges, etc.” Max Healthcare also issued a statement saying that its Saket branch, which is a Covid only facility, has incurred a loss of Rs 6.5 crore. The statement, however, did not refer to the rate card being circulated on social media. “We are today running close to 1000 Covid beds and have so far treated over 2000 Covid patients. We have 1970 HCWs (healthcare workers) taking care of these patients round the clock, we had over 427 HCWs falling sick and admitted, we had 3220 staff quarantined, and intermittently off work over the last two-and-half-months, yet we continue to serve,” a senior director at Max Healthcare, who did not wish to be named, said. The senior official also said the facility provides “research backed cutting-edge care and the outcomes are comparable to the best”. “This does make Covid care expensive. However, the accusations of profiteering are completely wrong; our Covid only facility in Saket, which is fully occupied for the month of May 2020, incurred a cash loss of Rs 6.5 crore. This, when we had cut salaries of our senior clinicians and management by 20 to 50 per cent,” the official sad. Max Healthcare has been serving patients from EWS sections (10 per cent) free of cost and serves CGHS, ECHS and other panel patients at subsidised pricing, where they have refused to even pay for the PPE costs being incurred by the hospital, the statement said.  The insurance and TPAs too have been dragging their feet on the reimbursement of these costs, it said. “We are a privately invested organisation with finite resources, we have been at the forefront of the Covid-19 battle in the country and yet making huge losses. Clearly, from a financial point of view we cannot sustain operations,” the senior representative said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-asks-all-hospitals-to-share-covid-19-treatment-charges-amid-high-cost-buzz/story-niyhnQCqLtDAMvhkSRoFwO.html
13-06-2020||City||Two deaths, 148 new Covid-19 cases reported in J&K||Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday reported two more fatalities due to Covid-19 and 148 more people tested positive for the virus, taking the total number of cases to 4,878, officials said.Officials said a retired doctor from Srinagar and 65-year-old man from south Kashmir have succumbed to the disease. With this, the death toll in the Union territory has risen to 55.The retired doctor was admitted at JVC SKIMS hospital and died on Friday morning. He had returned to Kashmir after working in Middle East for two decades. Doctors said he was on ventilation support and his condition deteriorated due to comorbidities. Srinagar nodal officer said a 65-year-old man who was admitted at SMHS hospital has also died due to the virus.Principal SKIMS Medical College Bemina, Dr Reyaz Ahmad Untoo, said with the emergence of more cases in Kashmir, several hospitals, including SKIMS Hospital Bemina, have been designated for treatment of Covid-19 patients. “So far, 415 patients were admitted at the hospital. Out of these, 310 were discharged after recovery,” he added.“With 176 bed capacity at present, SKIMS Bemina is the biggest Covid hospital in Kashmir. The hospital has registered 75% recovery rate and less than 0.5 mortality rate so far,” he said.“Patients with comorbidities like high blood pressure, diabetes, hypertension, orthopedic patients etc are also admitted at the hospital. Around 20-30 patients with 50-56 percent saturation level needed oxygen and have recovered,” Dr Untoo said.22 CRPF personnel test positive in south Kashmir At least 22 CRPF personnel from several battalions have tested positive for coronavirus in south Kashmir, officials said.The health authorities had collected samples from CRPF personnel from various battalions at Uranhall in south Kashmir, out of which test results for 22 samples have come out as positive. None of these troopers have any recent travel history, the officials added. The contact tracing of the COVID-19 positive CRPF personnel has been started so that those who came in contact with them can be quarantined, they said. Markets in Srinagar open with safety measures Markets in Srinagar reopened on Saturday after remaining closed for nearly three months due to the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of coronavirus, officials said. They said the decision to reopen the markets was taken by the district administration after deliberations with various trade and business bodies. The administration asked the markets to adhere to the necessary standard operating procedures and has come out with a detailed schedule for the opening of various sectors. While chemist shops, book shops, departmental stores, etc. have been allowed to remain open throughout the day from Monday to Saturday, shops selling readymade garments, cosmetics, footwear and jewellery will remain open from 11 am to 5.30 pm on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, the officials said. Similarly on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, beauty parlours, service stations and shops selling handicrafts, handloom, hardware, building material and furniture would remain open, they said.

The last left behind a trail of devastation in the Sundarbans.“I was part of a community kitchen organised in Kolkata by students and youth for people hit by the lockdown.After Cyclone Amphan struck Sundarbans, I decided to put to use my experience as a doctor,” Mukherjee told PTI on Saturday.He joined hands with groups like the West Bengal Doctors’ Forum and the Shramajibi Swasthyo Udyog to help the affected people.“I am just a foot soldier. I have been able to attend only a few of the 35 health camps organised by these groups.From treating patients to ensuring maintenance of social distancing in queues and helping in manual work, we work as a team of health workers in the camps,” he said.Mukherjee had been to areas in the Sundarbans like Patharpratima and Raidighi and has plans to visit Hasnabad on Sunday.“We will continue reaching out to people in the worst-affected areas of South and North 24 Parganas districts,” he said.Mukherjee, who was a student of Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata, said he is happy to see voluntary organisations and college students rushing to the aid of the people in distress, both due to the lockdown and Cyclone Amphan.“In this ‘Krantikal’ (critical juncture), any conscientious person cannot just remain indifferent,” he said.Mukherjee’s effort has been appreciated by people associated with the Bengali film industry. Filmmaker Anik Dutta wrote on Facebook, “Proud of you Kamal. I am filled with so much pride as I see the work of all these young men and women...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengali-filmmaker-dons-doctor-s-hat-to-treat-patients-in-cyclone-hit-sundarbans/story-DCHHllehlR0tynpBfQg18J.html
13-06-2020||Chandigarh||Guest column: Differences can be resolved, don’t burn your bridges||It’s natural to agree to disagree with someone. We all have differences – at work, within the family, with our children, our spouses, grandparents and amongst siblings too. Wherever there is a little bit of intellect, differences are bound to arise because of our capability of looking at the same thing from different angles.Differences are good, in fact many organizations can benefit from managers with different takes on solving one problem. Different ways of thinking sometimes lead to innovation and creativity and lay the foundation of strong and stable organisations provided our differences don’t degenerate to disputes. Differences cause damage only when we are not able to appreciate someone else’s point of view. We become judgmental too early. These differences make this world beautiful and interesting. We can have minor differences that we can easily manage. Just ignore them, live with them and, in fact, celebrate them. But then there are times when we have to sort out our differences within the family or the organisation or the society just to amicably coexist with the other. However, sometimes major differences between top leaders can create problems and hamper the progress of an organisation if not resolved. Similarly, some major differences can disrupt a family’s peace – perhaps forever.Dialogue worksI have the firm belief that the best way to resolve differences is through dialogue. The only condition is that we should have an open mind to respect diversity and divergent views and dignity of the other party. We should initiate dialogues without any preconceived notions and not let it degenerate into heated debates that we see every day now on various TV news channels.Dialogues should also be held in a cordial manner, only aiming at fostering mutual insight and common purpose.The other party should be given a patient hearing with maturity and empathy, with efforts made to seek common ground and explore new ideas and perspectives. Our shoulders should be broad enough to embrace criticism, transforming it to collaboration by even co-opting the ideas of the other party if possible. Any continuation of dialogue will ensure that our communication channels don’t break down and that we always remain focused on a solution.Disruption of dialogue will only create more barriers, leading to mistrust and then enmity and hatred.Building confidenceSo, we must keep talking, maybe more about our commonalities first before moving to minor differences which can be resolved easily. These may be called confidence building measures between the two parties. We can build bridges and strong bonds even with people who hold very different views from us.Differences will start disappearing when we focus more on the commonalities.Dialogue enables us to find common ground between two opposing parties and establishing priorities for action. Remember, effective dialogue requires all participants to have equal standing. Participants in the dialogue should listen to each other with mutual respect, empathy and dignity. Ideas and assumptions should be explored openly and without being judgmental in an effective dialogue. People will have to remove their coloured glasses before commencing any dialogue to be effective, meaningful and fruitful.They should remember, dialogue gives them an opportunity to build bridges and not burn them.mahavirindia@yahoo.com(The writer is a Chandigarh-based freelance contributor, views expressed are personal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/guest-column-differences-can-be-resolved-don-t-burn-your-bridges/story-QCu7kVsYwjBKvRe0S5rh1L.html

We need to identify, celebrate and embrace our heroes in early years. Our children need heroes in their schools and colleges to inspire them to make it big.”He said 90% of Indian schools need to have a full-time sports teacher who can actually give his 100% to the students and unleash and channelise their spirits.Growing hunger and urge to make it big and compete globally is the reason that more and more sporting stars are emerging from hinterland and slums, he said.Bhattacharjya exhorted the students to explore careers in sports like golf, distance running, tennis etc.Stating that one must seek inspiration from the champions who take both victory and defeat in their stride with same elan, he also dwelled upon the importance of being a team player as a vital key to success.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/embrace-your-heroes-early-on-sports-columnist-joy-bhattacharjya-tells-students/story-7z8oQNwHdBnqwtvjMndidJ.html
13-06-2020||City||Delhi: Man stabbed in front of 10-year-old daughter in north Delhi||New Delhi: A 37-year-old videographer was stabbed to death, allegedly by three men on a scooter, outside his home in outer Delhi’s Kiran Vihar near Aman Vihar Thursday night. According to the police, the man was killed in front of his 10-year-old daughter, who raised an alarm when she saw the suspects stabbing him.The family said that Bharat Bhushan was murdered allegedly for stopping some local boys from gambling and drinking publicly in the neighbourhood. “The family members have identified two of the three suspects and have told investigators that the attackers live 200-300 metres away from their home,” alleged DK Saxena, a friend of the family.Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pramod Kumar Mishra, however, said that the initial probe has indicated that Bhushan was killed over some financial dispute.The victim lived on the first floor of a three-storey building in Kiran Vihar. He ran his studio from the ground floor of the building. The second floor is occupied by his brother.On Thursday around 11 pm, Bhushan was having dinner at his home when someone called out his name from outside the building. He went outside while his daughter went to the balcony, where she saw her father discussing something with the man, said DCP Mishra.“Two more men arrived. Soon, an argument broke out between Bhushan and the three and one of them stabbed him in the chest. He screamed for help and collapsed on the ground. His daughter raised an alarm and alerted her mother. The attackers fled by the time the family members and neighbours rushed to his help,” added the DCP.According to Saxena, Bhushan was stabbed three times – once each in his chest, abdomen and thigh. He was rushed to a nearby hospital where doctors declared him brought dead.“Some local youths often indulge in public drinking and gambling in the neighbourhood. Bhushan used to actively advise them to refrain from doing such illegal activities. We strongly suspect that he was murdered over this same issue,” alleged Saxena.DCP Mishra said, “We have registered a case of murder and have identified the suspects. Raids are on and they will be nabbed soon.”Ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-man-stabbed-in-front-of-10-year-old-daughter-in-north-delhi/story-tdYQIsQergkiWtcZw0hQWK.html
13-06-2020||City||Govt should fix reasonable rates for Covid treatment in private hospitals||The situation created by Covid-19 is truly unparalleled, exceptional. However, we had ample time and opportunity to understand the magnitude of the problem, learn from the failures and successes of other countries and prepare adequately for the tsunami that would hit us. And the indications that one got from the government at the centre and the states were that we were well equipped to handle the situation.Yet, the ground reality today is frightening and the health infrastructure seems to have completely collapsed under the weight of the growing number of cases. So much so that consumers are forced, like beggars, to go from one hospital to another, desperately seeking medical help. And this is true in both Covid as well as non-Covid cases. And then they have to beg, borrow or steal to pay for the exorbitant payments demanded by the hospital -- if they happen to be privately run.A reader said he had a bad cold and some breathing problem and his employer admitted him to a small private hospital in Delhi, suspecting it to be Covid. The hospital however did not do any Covid test, just gave him a nebuliser and discharged him after two days, when his fever came down. His bill was Rs 2.16 lakhs. But price gouging is just one of the many problems that consumers are grappling with.The other is the treatment of the patient – since no family member is allowed to be with the patient, the latter is completely at the mercy of the hospital and many patients have complained that let alone treating their ailment, they were not even given food or a glass of water during the day. There have also been complaints of missing patients, relatives not informed of the death of a family member, bodies being handed to the wrong family and worse, the most undignified manner in which some of the dead are being handled.Usually, a chart on the patient’s bed carries his or her name, medical history, treatment given. The nursing staff also maintain a register of the patient. However, given the load on the hospitals, shortage of beds and the work pressure on the medical and the non-medical staff, there is every possibility of a patient being shifted to a different ward or bed (or moved to the mortuary if he is dead) without the accompanying identification. So in an epidemic of this magnitude, common sense dictates that every patient be given an arm band or a neck band identifying the person and his or her contact details. This must be a standard protocol and adhered to as soon as a patient is admitted. That would ensure proper identification of the patient.Similarly, since most relatives are anxious about the welfare of their dear ones admitted to the hospital, there should be proper mobile charging and WiFi facilities in the hospital that will enable patients to keep in touch with their family through video calls. This will not only allay the anxieties of the families, but also considerably boost the morale of the patient. This will also help relatives keep a watch on what’s happening and bring transparency in the hospital treatment .The hospital should therefore provide the facility to those patients who may not have a mobile phone that allows video calls. I am sure cell phone manufacturers would be only too happy to provide such phones free of cost to hospitals for the benefit of such patients.Doctors and nurses are putting their lives at risk to treat patients today and hats off to them. But hospitals in the private sector are not showing the same spirit and ruthlessly exploiting consumers, who are in a highly vulnerable position. Unless the central and the state governments come to their aid, fix reasonable prices for the treatment of Covid and other diseases and enforce it, many consumers will face abject poverty , not so much from the economic slowdown, but from paying hospital bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-should-fix-reasonable-rates-for-covid-treatment-in-private-hospitals/story-Z1NmEV41cirQIzlxZAh9XO.html
13-06-2020||City||Despite opening of trade, no import from Afghanistan via Wagah for 15 days||Despite opening of trade with Afghanistan, zero import has been witnessed through the Attari-Wagah border, 28km from Amritsar, in the last 15 days.Indian traders suspect Pakistan government’s design of not allowing free movement of trucks from Afghanistan as the reason behind this. They said that since opening of trade, many Indian importers had placed orders for goods from Afghanistan, but no truck was being allowed to cross the Chaman border in Pakistan.Cross-border trade and movement of passengers through the Integrated Check Post (ICP) in Attari had remained suspended for over two months as a precautionary measure to check spread of coronavirus. Trade between India and Afghanistan was resumed on May 28. And Pakistan had opened Chaman and Torkham border crossings for trade and civilian movement between Afghanistan and Pakistan mid-May.The ICP had been witnessing over Rs 1,000 crore trade with Afghanistan every year. Indian traders import dry fruit, herbs, cumin and liquorice (mulethi) from Afghanistan.On the first day of trade resumption, a truck of imported dry fruit from Afghanistan had crossed over at the ICP. However, from May 29 till date, no other Afghan truck has entered the ICP, said Land Port Authority of India (LPIA)’s ICP manager Sukhdev Singh.Another LPAI official said, “We got information that an Afghani truck carrying goods reached Wagah border in Pakistan two days ago, but the truck has not crossed over to India till Saturday. There may be some problems on Pakistan side due to coronavirus, which may have been hampering import.”Indian traders have alleged the Pakistan government of deliberately not allowing import from Afghanistan to India. “Pakistan is not allowing goods movement through the Chaman border,” said Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruit Association president Anil Mehra.He demanded that the Imran Khan government should allow movement of trucks from Afghanistan and open trade between India and Pakistan. “With opening of India-Pakistan trade the economy of both countries will be boosted and relations will be improved. We have demand resumption of Samjhauta Express between both the countries,” said another Amritsar-based trader.In the wake of the Pulwama attack in February 2019, the Indian government had revoked the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status given to Pakistan and raised customs duty on every item being imported from Pakistan to 200%. Following this, import from Pakistan had dipped drastically.Pakistani had shut trade with India and Samjhauta Express’ operations after India abrogated Article 370 that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/despite-opening-of-trade-no-import-from-afghanistan-via-wagah-for-15-days/story-9ydN061DTH4g9dX6UGEZTK.html
13-06-2020||Kolkata||Cyclone Amphan a catalyst for BJP’s new poll strategy in Bengal||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership in West Bengal is wooing voters by physically visiting areas affected by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak and Cyclone Amphan while holding virtual meetings in zones, where movement is difficult because of the pandemic. The opposition BJP’s outreach is aimed at crucial assembly polls slated to be held next year, while the civic body elections in the state have been postponed due to the pandemic.Bengal has reported over 10,000 Covid-19 cases. The pandemic and the destruction in Cyclone Amphan-hit districts have turned into catalysts for the BJP’s new strategy to wrest more ground from the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP had bagged 18 of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats, while the TMC’s tally came down from 34 to 22.State BJP leaders told HT that during the virtual conference on June 9, Union home minister Amit Shah had urged BJP workers and leaders to help people in every community block and polling booth area.In his public address, Shah had promised to oust the TMC government and criticised chief minister Mamata Banerjee for not implementing the Narendra Modi government’s welfare programmes for the poor, such as the Ayushman Bharat scheme.Shah’s strategy comes at a time when senior TMC leaders, such as panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee, have criticised party leaders for not visiting Amphan-hit areas. On June 12, BJP state president and Midnapore Lok Sabha member of Parliament (MP) Dilip Ghosh visited a quarantine centre in the Arjuni gram panchayat area in Kharagpur.On the same day, party general secretary and MP Locket Chatterjee met people in Hooghly district, while in Kolkata, the new BJP Mahila Morcha president Agnimitra Paul stood in rain to distribute hand-made masks and copies of the PM’s message on Atma Nirbhar Bharat.“You cannot see a single TMC minister visiting Amphan-affected districts. The Centre is sending funds, but you cannot see any relief work on the ground,” alleged Ghosh.“Our party’s entire focus is on the 2021 assembly polls. Since the CM is a woman, the Mahila Morcha has to play a key role. Poor people have been affected the most by the pandemic and Amphan. We distributed over 33,000 masks and the PM’s message on Friday. This will continue in all the districts for a week,” said Paul, a well-known fashion designer, who also holds a degree in business management.The masks have emerged as a symbol of the ongoing political war.Around a fortnight ago, Ghosh appeared before the media wearing a saffron mask with a big lotus (the party’s symbol) printed on it. This caught on.Earlier this week, a photograph of CM Banerjee wearing a white and blue (the state’s official colours) mask with a map of Bengal and the word ‘Maa’ (mother) written in bold in Bengali did the rounds on social media. “Copying is the best form of appreciation, but it’s a bad design. Had she sought my help I could have designed a better one. Many TMC leaders are in touch with us, waiting to join,” quipped Paul.On Saturday, Soumitra Khan, the new state president of the BJP Yuva Morcha, visited a blood donation camp and distributed hand sanitisers in Howrah. “The Yuva Morcha is strengthening BJP’s position at polling booth level in Howrah, Kolkata, Birbhum, Midnapore and the North and South 24 Parganas. Our motto is ‘apna booth, apna dum’ (our booth, our strength),” said Khan. “The party’s media and IT (information technology) cells are helping us hold virtual meetings at places, where physical gatherings cannot be held,” he added.“In the Lok Sabha polls, our vote share was low in several south Bengal assembly segments. Many of these were later hit by the pandemic and Amphan. The disasters exposed the cracks in governance, something we had been trying to tell the voters for long,” said Ritesh Tiwari, one of the new state vice-presidents of the BJP.The TMC has not taken the BJP’s new campaign strategy lightly.The CM’s nephew and Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha MP Abhishek Banerjee, who also leads the youth wing, launched the Banglar Jubo Shakti (Bengal’s youth power) programme on June 11.“I am pleased to announce the launch of #BanglarJuboShakti, an initiative of TMYC to onboard, unite and join hands with one lakh motivated youth who are willing to help the people of Bengal during this time of crisis,” tweeted Banerjee.On June 4, Banerjee had tweeted, “@BJP4Bengal leaders have made no contribution towards improving the lives of people in Bengal but have definitely started preparing for Bengal elections 2021. Priorities are clear. @MamataOfficial continues to stand by her people & protect them from every danger #BanglarShotruBJP”“It’s unfortunate that the BJP is trying to take political advantage of the pandemic and the cyclone that have affected millions. No party in the world has done such a thing. The BJP has no organisational strength in Bengal. Their desperate efforts won’t yield any result,” said Tapas Roy, minister of state for parliamentary affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/cyclone-amphan-a-catalyst-for-bjp-s-new-poll-strategy-in-bengal/story-DiVooywHBfaZryEjvleP9L.html

13-06-2020||Dehradun||Pregnant woman dies after 4 hospitals refuse admission, govt orders probe||A magisterial probe has been ordered by the Dehradun district administration after a pregnant woman (24) died on June 11 because four hospitals in Dehradun allegedly denied her admission. Kamlesh Sahni, the woman’s husband, alleged that a private hospital did not admit her on June 9 on the pretext that she was only seven-month pregnant.“On June 9 morning, we visited a private hospital, where the doctors refused to admit my wife because she was seven-month pregnant and instead gave her some medicines. My wife also said we should go back home. However, shortly after we reached home, she went into a labour pain shortly and delivered twin babies,” said Sahni.“One of the babies died soon after the delivery on June 9, while the other baby passed away a few hours before my wife expired on June 11,” he added.Surrender Sahni, the deceased’s brother-in-law, said, “I went to see the babies at around 4 pm on June 9, when the newborns and my sister-in-law were doing well, but she was complaining of pain in one of her legs. My brother said he had administered her medicines to relieve her pain in the leg. Though she was keeping well the following day, her health condition started worsening overnight. On June 11, we went to four different hospitals, where we were denied admission without any reason.”He added: “Finally, we managed to get in touch with a lawmaker, who told officials at Government Doon Medical College Hospital to admit her. However, we lost a precious day because of the denial of admission by the four hospitals. My sister-in-law was admitted to the hospital around 4 pm on June 11, but she died within a few hours. Her other baby, who had survived, also died a few hours before her. Perhaps, my sister-in-law would have survived had she been admitted before.”NS Khatri, deputy medical superintendent at Government Doon Medical College Hospital, said that the woman was brought to the hospital on June 11 at around 11 am and she was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), as her condition was not stable.However, the family members alleged that though she was brought to the hospital at around 11 am, she was denied admission, after which they went to a few more private hospitals before finally going back to Doon Medical College Hospital again at around 4 pm, when she was admitted because of the lawmaker’s call.Dr. Khatri said that the woman passed away at around 6 pm on June 11.The cause of death is not known. However, her family members are claiming that it could be the loss of blood, as the deceased had felt weak and during her pre-natal care one of the doctors had also told her that she was anaemic.Dehradun district magistrate (DM) Ashish Srivastava ordered a magisterial probe into this matter on the following day.Arvind Pandey, additional district magistrate (administration), said that a private hospital had turned away the pregnant woman on June 9, as she was not due for delivery. She was only seven-month pregnant, instead of nine months, when the delivery usually happens, he added.“On June 11, she was taken to Coronation Hospital for treatment of a leg injury. Initially, she was referred to Gandhi Shatabdi Hospital, and later to Government Doon Medical College Hospital, as the doctors wanted her to undergo a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) test. However, she passed away before she could receive proper treatment,” said Pandey, who has been appointed as the nodal officer for the inquiry.“The DM has urged people to volunteer information about the woman’s death within a week, while the probe is also underway,” Pandey added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/pregnant-woman-dies-after-4-hospitals-refuse-admission-govt-orders-probe/story-X4BDo0GOGosZQzOcWgBDQK.html

Private vehicles will be allowed to ply as per the odd-even formula. However, essential services have been exempted from this system. “On every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, vehicles registration numbers ending with odd numbers will be allowed to ply while those ending with even numbers will move on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday,” Vaishya said.Kargil magistrate Baseer-ul-Haq Choudhary has also clamped strict restrictions in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ladakh-covid-19-tally-rises-to-437-with-biggest-single-day-spike-of-198-infections/story-aVbs1er7lus2JjDSRduAHN.html

Out of 1,600 samples tested at the Chennai-based National Institute for Research, only 5 tested positive for Covid-19.“The ICMR, along with state health departments, had collected 400 samples each from nearly 69 districts across the country. In Punjab, four vulnerable districts were selected for the survey and 1,600 blood samples were collected for testing. The sample collection in the state started on May 19. The blood samples were tested through rapid antibody test kits and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test kits, developed by the National Institute of Virology, Pune,” state health department spokesperson for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said.He added, “The ICMR concluded that the prevalence and spread of the Covid-19 infection is less than 1% in Punjab. Of the five positive patients, three were from Patiala and two from Jalandhar. None was found positive in the samples from Ludhiana and Gurdaspur.”The ICMR will reveal more nationwide findings from the survey in its second report in a month’s time. The final report will give an idea about the transmission based on gender, age and socio-economic characteristics. Though Amritsar has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in Punjab, it was not included in the survey as most of the cases at that time pertained to Nanded-returnees and didn’t fall in the category of community spread, health officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-community-spread-in-punjab-icmr/story-Ek42us59Od04vQuPyNIA8O.html

13-06-2020||Mumbai||4 persons who assaulted cops get bail, asked to deposit ₹5000 in CM’s Relief Fund||The Bombay high court on Friday granted bail to four persons who were part of a mob which attacked police patrol unit in Govandi during the lockdown on the condition that they deposit a fine of ₹5000 ‘as punishment to be responsible citizens’ in the chief minister’s relief fund. The fine amount is over and above the personal bond of ₹10000 that each of the accused has to furnish for the bail.The single-judge bench of justice Bharati Dangre while hearing the bail applications of Gaus Mohammed Shaikh and three others were informed by advocates Jigar Agarwal and Shaikh Shafi Ahmed that there was no evidence against the four and they were arrested and booked only because they were in 22-25 years age group and were residents of the locality where the incident happened.The incident according to the prosecution occurred on April 26 when a police patrol was enforcing the lockdown in Govandi by shooing away hawkers squatting on the footpath. A mob of 25-30 persons brutally attacked the patrol team by throwing bricks and pelting them and their vehicles with stones. The prosecution submitted that the mob resorted to vandalism intending to impair police personnel from discharging their duty.Advocate HJ Dedhia appearing for the police submitted that the attack destroyed one of the police vans. “Entire conduct of the mob was shameful and they attempted to assault the police personnel engaged in official duty and who are rather putting their life at risk in the situation of Covid-19 pandemic to keep citizens safe and free of Covid-19,” said Dedhia. After the situation was brought under control the Shivaji Nagar police arrested the four and charged them with an attempt to murder and for damaging public property and for disobeying orders by Police under Maharashtra Police Act.Dedhia also informed the court that two of the applicants had tested positive for Covid-19 and tested negative after appropriate medical treatment.After hearing submissions, Justice Dangre observed, “No doubt, the incident is unfortunate in the present scenario and the fact that several such incidences and occurrences are being reported in the entire country cannot be lost sight of.”The Court further said, “Though the applicants are entitled to the benefit of the doubt, alleged act policemen being attacked apparently while trying to enforce the corona virus-induced lock-down need to be tackled on a serious note. The applicants should be made to bear the consequences of assaulting the police team and causing an interruption in the discharge of their official duty.”While granting bail to the applicants on furnishing a personal bond of ₹10, 000 with sureties, justice Dangre said that the applicants could be released on bail if they deposited ₹5000 each to the CM fund on their immediate release adding that, “Failure to do so would result in recalling of the said order releasing them on bail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/4-persons-who-assaulted-cops-get-bail-asked-to-deposit-5000-in-cm-s-relief-fund/story-dcKdAk07NivRpKtodZdkSM.html

With staff testing positive, the hospital is now falling short of manpower. The existing staff is now overburdened, said the nurses.A group of nurses met the Thane collector Rajesh Narekar on Friday and narrated their ordeal. They demanded proper facilities at the government-run hospital at Ulhasnagar-3.Kavita Nimje, 54, a nurse said, “Even though the Central Hospital is not a Covid hospital, several suspected Covid-19 patients were admitted in the ward. This led to the spread of the infection among the staffs and non-Covid patients. We are not even provided with proper kits.”“The Red Cross Hospital for Covid patients, which is located opposite to the Central Hospital is facing a shortage of staff, so our doctors and nurses work there and deal with Covid patients. The Red Cross Hospital has only 23 beds, which is not sufficient. Hence, the suspected patients are sent here,” said Nimje.The Central Hospital has an isolation ward which has 21 beds and has another 202 beds in the general ward for other patients coming from Karjat, Kasara, Badlapur and other nearby cities.Another nurse on conditions of anonymity said, “We have asked the collector to improve the infrastructure at the Central Hospital, so that suspected Covid patients can be dealt with separately. Also, we have asked for more staffs at the Covid hospital. We are ready to work anywhere, but there should be clarity on whether we have to deal with Covid patients or non-Covid patients, as we need to take precautions accordingly.”Thane collector, Rajesh Narvekar said, “There is a need to increase infrastructure to deal with suspected Covid patients. The civic body is setting up more Covid care centres in Ulhasnagar. A hospital is being set up with 200 beds in the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ulhasnagar-hosp-staff-demand-better-facility-to-deal-with-covid-patients/story-1KhOtN3HEKiyyr8kd7af2H.html

In a statement issued here, Bukhari said, “It’s time we realise that Covid-19 containment is critical but healthcare services for other patients can no longer be ignored.” “Amid this situation, halting OPD and non-emergency services especially at government hospitals in order to divert all its resources to combat Covid-19 is affecting thousands of patients across Jammu and Kashmir whose lives are on the peril in absence of requisite healthcare facilities,” he said.“Reduced access to both out-patient and in-patient services can prove fatal for non-Covid patients—both suffering from communicable and non-communicable diseases, Bukhari said, adding that the health and medical education departments must ensure that these patients don’t bear the brunt of the crisis.“Patients with scheduled surgical procedures and follow-up visits are undergoing an unimaginable crisis. The state in which Cancer patients are forced to live without hospitalisation will prove fatal for many. Similar is the condition of patients suffering from last stage renal disease and dependent on haemodialysis,” he said.The government and health department should also facilitate routine check-up of psychiatry patients, particularly those suffering from depression, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/non-covid-patients-in-j-k-must-get-proper-medical-facilities-altaf-bukhari/story-0kubMUOJeEPdqK0tbE1wbL.html

However, notes of denomination Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 are available in shops and used by children as toy or for various projects. Apart from Rs 1,000 denomination, 1.52 lakh notes of Rs 500 denomination and 2.17 lakh notes of Rs 2,000 denominations were found from the accused’s possession.“The notes of Rs 1,000 denomination are unavailable in the market. The sale of notes of other denomination is not even 5 per cent of the total stock. Every bundle of 100 notes of any denomination costs around Rs 30-35. Now even board games have started using plastic chips or credit and debit cards,” said Sachin Kulkarni, owner of Toy station in Kunte chowk, Pune.“Whenever required, multiple suppliers are available in Ravivar peth. Most of the toy shop owners take notes from them,” said Viral Shah, owner of Maahi toy shop in Camp, Pune.“We rarely see customers asking for these notes for school projects or as a plaything. Notes of Rs 1,000 denomination are not in demand. The lockdown has even affected the supply,” said a vendor on Laxmi road.In the local market, one set of 10 different denominations, including Re 1, Rs 2, Rs 5 notes can be bought for Rs 20. The notes mention the ‘Children’s Bank of India’ in Hindi and English.One of the demarcations between Children’s Bank of India and legal tender bank notes are the electrotype watermark and Mahatma Gandhi image which can be seen on the blank white strip on each of the legal notes. The Reserve Bank of India emblem, which has a tiger in it, is replaced with the word ‘colours’ with each alphabet printed in a different colour for Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 denomination notes.

It saw more than 110 participants.Throwing light on the topic, epidemiologist and Padma Shri awardee Dr Omesh Kumar Bharti said, “It is true that coronavirus is a zoonotic virus that lives inside animals, but it does not cause disease to them. It afflicts humans when transmitted through unsanitary means, so sanitisation is the prerequisite.”“Not all bats harbour the virus. The take-home message is that nature harbours several pathogens and if we disturb the environmental balance, pathogens are going to take an advantage of it and we will see many more pandemics,” he cautioned.In his address, PU vice-chancellor Professor Raj Kumar ensured the students that all the decisions regarding exams would be made keeping in view their welfare and safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/animals-in-focus-during-covid-19-webinar-at-panjab-university/story-TTiEH5lrPiElsrv3kRasKO.html

Though the PRTC resumed its services on May 20, but it is running only 150 of a fleet of 1,045 buses on select routes. The corporation has failed to pay last month’s salary and pension to over 10,000 current and former employees as it requires ₹19 crore per month for the same.Nirmal Singh Dhaliwal, convener of trade unions linked with PRTC, said it was a sad state of affairs that the government and transport department had orphaned the PRTC in these hard times.“If only the government provides the departmental claims on time, pension and the salary can be cleared. The government has stalled claims related to free and departmental concessional travelling for three years. Even over ₹2 crore are due against ‘Mukh Mantri Tirath Darshan Yatra’ scheme,” he said. The corporation was not been compensated for bringing back Punjab residents from Hazur Sahib, students from Rajasthan and ferrying migrant labourers to railway stations and elsewhere, he said.PRTC managing director Jaskiran Singh said the case related to clearing ₹200 crore has already been submitted to the state government. “We are already holding meetings with top officials of transport department so as to get immediate financial relief for clearing of committed expenses,” he said. Singh said they expect to clear payments to employees in the coming week.The corporation faced a loss of ₹51 crore in the first 60 days of the lockdown, with average daily loss pegged at ₹85 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/income-down-by-90-prtc-seeks-210-cr-dues-from-govt/story-Iq8vg1K7MmLFQkcRsTaPFL.html

He added that the tendering with regard to these projects was in progress and the work would begin soon.Sidhu said the transformation of these roads would fulfil the long-pending demand of the people of the constituency and mitigate the traffic related problems along with minimising the possibility of road mishaps.“People who have to commute to Mohali, Chandigarh or Kharar for jobs and other works, especially farmers, milk and vegetable vendors, would not encounter any problem now,” said Sidhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-to-have-wider-link-roads-says-health-minister/story-Na3cBwH4kKO9N58mQsHC4J.html

In the letter, he said that the presence of the opposition leader was mandatory. Agnihotri in the letter cited that he had ascribed the reason for not attending the meeting due to his prefixed engagement on June 9.“I’m writing to inform you that proceeding with the selection of the chairperson and members of the State Human Rights Commission on basis of the decision made on June 9 would constitute an affront on the statutory norm and the democratic values. Section 22 of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 mandates the inclusion of leader of opposition in the appointment committee,” the letter read.“I intimated the government about my unavailability on that specific day due to unavoidable circumstances. As per the precedent if a member cannot attend the meeting on a specific day, it has to be rescheduled,” he said. Mukesh also cited examples of previous Virbhadra Singh-led government where leader of opposition Prem Kumar Dhumal could not make it to the meetings on three occasions and the government reorganised them each time.“Importantly according to the statute, the government could carry on with the selection only in case there was a vacancy in the office of the leader of opposition, which is clearly not the case here. It is also pertinent to mention that no agenda was served,” he added.He said that it was appalling that the government chose to proceed without abiding by the precedent and the statute in the very first meeting. It is a cause of grave concern as the independence of the commission would be threatened by such appointments. It would also erode the public confidence in the pious commission.” Agnihotri aid urging the government to reschedule the meeting so that democratic values and rule of law are upheld in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/selection-of-shrc-chairperson-mires-into-controversy-hp-s-leader-of-opposition-questions-move/story-Mw06k5f3nIFxjbZH01OGvM.html

Last week, the local bodies department of the state government cut Rs 141 crore from the MC budget, leaving officials in a fix. They are wondering how to meet expectations of residents when the finances, which are already in the red, have been cut. Tough times, indeed.CTU’s blessing in disguiseThe slowdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic has hit Chandigarh Transport Undertaking, too. Already struggling with financial issues, the lockdown has further hit its ability to generate revenues. But the cancellation of long route buses two days after they were started is a blessing in disguise. “We can carry only 50% of the seating capacity because of social distancing norms. The passenger turnout was hardly 10% but we were incurring full running costs. With the long-route service suspended, at least we can save on running costs,” an employee said.For Chandigarh cops, alcohol is no “nasha”For the police in Mohali and Chandigarh, alcohol is no “nasha (addiction)”. Chandigarh Police recently arrested a man for stealing copper transformers from the traffic light of Sectors 21-22 in Chandigarh.

Later, the green panel once again restrained the real estate developer from any activity The apex court has now directed the committee to examine various aspects including the viability of the project without being influenced by any of the opinions expressed by the NGT.The top court granted liberty to University of Delhi and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation to file their respective representation along with requisite documents before the committee within two weeks. The committee, before it starts its first deliberation, shall afford an opportunity of preliminary hearing to the appellant, University of Delhi and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, it said.“The committee shall complete the deliberation and submit its final report within two months from the date of the representation being filed by the appellant and University of Delhi and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation.

The apex court was hearing an appeal by Young Builders against NGT January 8 order.The tribunal had passed the order on a plea by Delhi University challenging the environmental clearance granted to a housing project by Young Builders (P) Ltd in North Delhi.The plea challenged the order of the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority granting Environmental Clearance (EC) for the housing complex located at 1 and 3, Cavalry Lane and 4, Chhatra Marg at Civil Lines here.It said EC could be granted by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and not by SEIAA as the project is within 10 km from Critically Polluted Area, notified by CPCB.DU said the permission sought by Young Builders Private Limited for construction of a group housing society in the University enclave was violative of the Master Plan of Delhi-2021 and was against the larger public interest, “given the fact that the project site in question and its vicinity are within the North Campus of the University and that it contains various historical and archaeological buildings”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/real-estate/examine-viability-of-building-housing-complex-near-du-campus-sc-to-ngt-committee/story-o4PBy00jrP1xGBZD08RswO.html

13-06-2020||Chandigarh||BJP steps up efforts to quell rebellion in Himachal||At a time when the opposition Congress has mounted an attack on the Jai Ram Thakur-led BJP government in Himachal Pradesh in the backdrop of the health department scam, the Bharatiya Janata Party high command has swung into action to quell fresh rebellion in the party.The high command has sought a report on the dissidence in its state unit. The move follows Jwalamukhi legislator Ramesh Chand Dhawala, who is also the chairman of the state planning board, opening a front against state unit organising secretary Pawan Rana recently.Dhawala, a four-time legislator, vented his ire against Rana at the BJP legislature party meeting to counter Congress attacks on the government that became intense after BJP state president Rajeev Bindal stepped down as his name was dragged into the bribe for purchase of medical equipment controversy.Legislators from the Kangra region, which has 15 assembly segments, too joined the chorus but later backtracked. Dhawala, who was keen on a ministerial berth after the BJP won a majority in the 2017 elections, alleged that Rana was interfering in the day-to-day functioning of his constituency, while his supporters were facing humiliation.‘IT WAS AN EMOTIONAL OUTBURST’On Saturday, however, Dhawala apologised for his remarks against Rana. “It was an emotional outburst,” he said in a letter to the state BJP leadership. “I have always worked for strengthening the party and had no intention to hurt the government or the organisation,” he said.The former minister said that he had some issues which he raised with the chief minister who has assured to resolve them at the earliest after discussing them on the party platform. “I sincerely apology for the remarks which I made in the media driven by emotions,” he said.Earlier, chief minister Thakur had convened the meeting of BJP legislators from Kangra at his house over lunch in a bid to placate them. Most of them fell in line but Dhawala was defiant. He said he remained with the party in thick and thin and alleged that some new leaders were trying to create a space for themselves and destroying party cadres. Dhawala accused Rana of giving preference to Congress workers in his constituency. He said he had written to Thakur and national BJP president Jagat Parkash Nadda to apprise them of Rana’s “arbitrary functioning”.After fresh infighting, the BJP went into damage control mode with leaders denying that the meeting had anything to do with party matters. Rather, they said, the meeting was convened to review developmental works in Kangra.“Legislators from Kangra could not raise issues pertaining to their constituencies during the meeting so the chief minister convened an informal meeting at his residence,” Nurpur legislator Rakesh Pathania later said.BINDAL TO RANA’S DEFENCEBindal also defended Rana, saying he had been instrumental in strengthening the party at the grassroots. “Using harsh language against him was uncalled for,” Bindal said.The rebellion comes three weeks after leaders owing allegiance to former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal stepped up their activities in Kangra district, known for tilting the political scales. The Dhumal group led by former irrigation and public health minister Ravinder Singh Ravi along with Kangra Lok Sabha member Kishan Kapoor and others had met in Dharamshala to discuss the political scenario in the state after Bindal’s resignation. Dhumal’s group had been lying low ever since his unexpected defeat in the assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bjp-steps-up-efforts-to-quell-rebellion-in-himachal/story-58tq2BRJF2LwlEforr9SEP.html

The issue of lack of workers is being faced not just by construction business but by almost every industry ever since lakhs of migrant workers went back to their native towns and villages on Shramik Special trains started by the Indian Railways on May 1.This has led companies to becoming proactive in wooing back the migrant workers by adopting measures such as paying the workers’ train – and in some cases, even flight - fare, offering higher wages and better working conditions.In the midst of efforts to bring the economy back on track, the number of coronavirus cases in India continue to rise. With more than 11,000 new Covid-19 cases recorded between Friday and Saturday, the country’s total count has crossed the three-lakh mark, standing at 308,993, as per the Union health ministry data. The death toll from the infection is now at 8,884.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/real-estate/builders-body-to-train-youth-from-villages-near-mumbai-to-tackle-labour-shortage/story-keXDmcorqAvSxoZluZh7YI.html

In a statement, Bindal said the BJP was an ideological organisation, not a specific person, or a means of gaining power. “Leaders such as Dr Syama Prasad Mukherjee, Deendayal Upadhyaya, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, LK Advani and numerous workers have worked hard to build the party,” he said. Bindal said Pawan Rana had been working for social and national causes for the last 25 years. Disrespecting him was tantamount to disrespecting the party. Bindal said all decisions made within the party are made collectively and blaming one person was wrong.“Rana has worked very hard to ensure the progress of organisation. He has put his health on stake, left his family and renounced other pleasures for the organisation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/it-is-inappropriate-for-any-bjp-leader-to-publically-criticise-a-senior-party-leader-former-himachal-bjp-chief/story-jdZnFa1pPyWcsvdXPcNx3J.html

13-06-2020||Pune||Fake currency racket: Counterfeit notes procured from Mumbai, Hyderabad||Pune: After a day’s interrogation, the Pune police crime branch officials have learned that the accused men in the fake currency racket had procured the Rs 1,000 counterfeit notes from markets in Mumbai and Hyderabad. To convince the customers, arrested persons to pretend as descendants of “Royal Family of Nizam” by showing the picture of Nizam put up before their bunglow. On June 10, there were two types of Rs 1,000 notes that were seized from a Sanjay Park bungalow in Viman nagar, Pune. While the ones procured from Mumbai were colourful, the ones procured from Hyderabad had a colour scheme similar to the demonetised Rs 1,000 notes.In total, 3.18 lakh notes of the entire Children’s Bank notes found in the house were of Rs 1,000 denomination, according to the police submission in a local court in Pune.The aim for the stacking of notes was to show availability through videos and photos that were spread within their network of potential customers.“They kept a newspaper on top of the bundles and shot a video to show the number of notes available. The notes were merely for the video from what we have gathered so far,” said police inspector Anjum Bagwan of unit 4 of the crime branch of Pune police.Bagwan said, “the six accused often lied to customers while citing Royal Family leanings. They used to tell customers that they are Nizam’s descendants and had put pictures of Nizam outside their bungalow.” Three among the six accused were instrumental in circulating the videos.“So far they claim to have circulated 20-25 videos of notes with newspaper on it. Once the video was circulated, they would ask for Rs 50,000 cash payment,” said PI Bagwan.However, the method of cheating after the initial cash was delivered by the customers is not yet clear.The arrested men were identified as lance naik Shaikh Alim Gulab Khan, 36, member of the Indian Army bank at Bombay Sappers; Sunil Badrinarayan Sarda, 40, from Kondhwa, Pune; Ritesh Ratnakar, 34, from Kamothe, Navi Mumbai; and Tufail Ahmed Mohammad Ishaq Khan, 28, Abdulgani Rehmtullah Khan, 43, and his son Abdul Rehman Abdulgani Khan, 19, of Meera Road in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/fake-currency-racket-counterfeit-notes-procured-from-mumbai-hyderabad/story-pIlFE3zBLh5ewaxPIWdwVP.html
13-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurgaon sees 6-fold increase in deaths, cases rise over 3.5 times: Data||Gurgaon in Haryana, one of the worst-hit districts in the country by the coronavirus pandemic, has recorded a six-fold increase in deaths, while the cases have gone up more than three-and-a-half times between May 31 and June 11, data showed on Friday.Of the nearly 6,000 total cases in Haryana, Gurgaon alone accounts for more than 45 per cent and 19 out of the total 64 Covid-19 related deaths in the state.The two other worst-hit districts are — Faridabad and Sonipat, which, like Gurgaon, fall in the National Capital Region next to Delhi. Together, these three districts account for more than 4,000 cases and 46 of the 64 deaths as on June 11.By May 31, Gurgaon had three deaths and 774 Covid-19 cases (487 active). But by June 11, the numbers rose to 19 fatalities and 2,737 cases (1,760 active).Gurgaon reported six deaths on a single day on June 11, the health department data showed.Between May 31 and June 11, Haryana as a whole recorded a three-fold increase in coronavirus deaths and cases, from 20 to 64 and 2,091 to 5,968 respectively.The COVID-19 positive rate went up from 1.84 per cent to 3.80 per cent during the period and the fatality rate increased from 0.96 per cent to 1.07 per cent. The rate of doubling of cases accelerated from 9 to 7 days, and the recovery rate dropped to 37.87 per cent from 50.12 per cent, according to the data.In Faridabad, the total cases rose from 367 and eight fatalities on May 31 to 929 cases and 22 deaths by June 11.In Sonipat, the total cases rose from 199 and one death on May 31 to 502 and five deaths by June 11.Gurgaon’s Chief Medical Officer Virender Yadav said a majority of the 19 patients who died in the district either had co-morbid conditions or were aged above 60 years.“The patients either had co-morbid conditions including cardiac issues, diabetes, other severe ailments or were above 60 years of age,” Dr Yadav told PTI over the phone.Additional Chief Secretary (Health) Rajiv Arora too said most of the patients who died across the state had severe co-morbid conditions.Yadav, who was the CMO of the adjoining Nuh district, joined as CMO Gurgaon replacing Dr J S Punia, who amid rising cases in the “millennium city”, was transferred to Nuh.Yadav, credited with controlling spread of the pandemic to a large extent in Nuh, which has a total over 100 cases with no fatality, said his immediate priority was to have results of samples processed within 36 hours which at present was 4-5 days in Gurgaon.When results are available in a shorter span of time, it helps in quickly tracing the patient’s contact and taking remedial measures, Yadav said.Arora, when asked about the sudden rise in cases, especially in Gurgaon and Faridabad, said on Thursday, “we are alive and alert”.Asked if Gurgaon was heading towards community transmission, he said the district’s population was nearly 2 million and going by the number of active cases, that wasn’t the case.He said more than 75 lakh people live in the four districts of Gurgaon, Faridabad, Sonipat and Jhajjar, and there are around 2,600 active cases in these areas, which is why this cannot be called community spread.Increasing sampling, better contact-tracing, tracking those with travel history and house-to-house search by health workers, especially among the vulnerable sections of society, were some of the measures which the health department was taking, Arora said. As cases continued to mount from the NCR districts, Health Minister Anil Vij recently said he was concerned at the rate at which infections were spreading in areas adjoining the national capital.He cited movement of people from Delhi into these districts of Haryana as the reason behind the surge in cases.Vij, who is also the home minister, had imposed stricter restrictions on inter-state borders, especially in the districts that share borders with Delhi, including Gurgaon.For the time being, shopping malls and places of worship have not been reopened for the public in Gurgaon and Faridabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/from-june-1-gurgaon-sees-6-fold-increase-in-deaths-cases-rise-over-3-5-times-data/story-D3mFINwvdmn65uRcKetsdN.html

13-06-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC seeks report on protocol followed for testing high-risk asymptomatic Covid prisoners||A two-member division bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Friday asked the additional director-general (ADG), prisons, Maharashtra, to submit a report on the protocol being followed in the state’s jails to test asymptomatic high-risk inmates, who have come in direct contact with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive prisoners.The division bench, comprising chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice SS Shinde, also sought to know from the ADG, prisons, about Covid-19 related fatality count of the inmates while conducting the hearing via video-conference facility because of the pandemic.The court asked these questions to ADG, prisons, in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the Mumbai chapter of the People’s Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL), the largest and the oldest human rights organisation in the country.PUCL has sought the court’s orders to provide information regarding the status of inmates’ health and the extent to which the viral infection might have spread among them, as they are lodged in congested jails across the state while pulling up the state government for a lack of transparency in voluntarily disclosing the details.The human rights body also sought directions to ensure that inmates have ample access to personal protective equipment (PPE) items such as face masks, hand sanitisers, etc; for free of cost.The petitioner also prayed for a report from the state prisons’ authorities regarding the precautionary measures being taken in the jails in their fight against the viral outbreak.The court’s directions came after the petitioner’s counsel, senior advocate Mihir Desai, pointed out that though 80 inmates of Solapur and Aurangabad correctional homes have tested Covid-19 positive, the asymptomatic inmates have not been tested in violation of the guidelines prescribed by the Indian Council of Medical of Research (ICMR).On Desai’s request, the court asked ADG, prisons, to consider allowing prisoners to interact more with their family members.The court also took note of Desai’s contention that 11,527 applications for temporary bail were still pending in lower courts, which tend to frustrate the spirit of the Supreme Court (SC) order directing states to decongest prisons following the viral outbreak over the last three months.The bench has called for a report from all principal district and sessions judges disclosing the exact number of urgent bail applications that are pending and the dates on which these applications were submitted.The court will hear the case next on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-seeks-report-on-protocol-followed-for-testing-high-risk-asymptomatic-covid-prisoners/story-McyWANxRsf6mFAZ9XgBRDL.html

13-06-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: In a rented room of her own||A small room stacked with books, a writing table, two single beds and two pairs of grilled windows. Plus, a terrace where she frequently strolls, gathers ideas and later jots them down in her journal.This is her world in north Delhi’s Roop Nagar. A 20-year-old final year grad student in Delhi University’s Kirori Mal College, she requested for only her first name to be used.Prachi lives alone in this rented apartment (she does have a mostly absent roomie). Here she spent the entire duration of the coronavirus-triggered lockdown, though “I have to leave this room soon,” she reveals, her voice tinged with a hint of regret. “My college life will come to an end with the online exams in July.” Then she’ll have no choice but to pack her books, clothes and her ukulele, and return to her parents’ house in neighbouring Faridabad city “where I don’t know until how long I might have to stay... it all depends on the pandemic.”Prachi admits she will certainly miss her current life of being on her own: reading, writing, ordering books on net and patiently waiting for their delivery. And watching “all the sunrises and sunsets,” as well as the shifting daylight as it traverses around the interiors of her room from morning to evening. The young woman will be missing this locality of Roop Nagar, too. “It is true to its name, very beautiful. Quiet. Mostly residential. Lots of trees. Flowers blooming all year long. Many birds.”Standing by her writing table, she shows her journals—one is in English, the other is in Hindi. These days, apart from writing poetry, she is reading a lot of short stories “for I soon plan to write them myself.”Prachi answers a set of questions we have been asking people from diverse backgrounds as a way of getting a sense of day-to-day experiences during this history-making coronavirus pandemic.Things you’ll do after the pandemic is over.When this ends, I will walk in the crowded lanes of Chandni Chowk, looking upwards at the brilliant balconies and arches of seemingly regular houses and shops, drinking glass after glass of mohabbat sherbet. I will stroll along the lanes of Lodhi Art district, and inhale colourfulness to my heart’s delight. I will watch a sunset from the roof of Indian Coffee House. I will make love to this city as I have done for the last few years. And eventually but surely, I will go to the mountains.The view outside your window at the moment.Outside my window is spread out the terrace, at the end of which two chairs sit facing each other. Next to them, just now, two sparrows have landed, and are fighting over their shared meal of a single lizard. From across the road, I can see the giant tree that has changed from blood-red to cotton-white to moss-green in the past few months. Behind it, the colour of the sky has cast a pale languor upon all existence, as it seems, and I am convinced to be one with it and to embrace inactivity this evening.What’s going on in your mind right now?Just now I was remembering how convinced I was as a kid of the greatness coming my way. I was sure that life would be wonderful. Even as I could not map a path to this greatness, whatever that was, one could always depend on chance – some brilliant accident, some coincidence that will bring life to glory. As we grow up, we simply stop expecting miracles and cease to believe in magic, because it does not happen. Or, is it the other way around?Objects in the house that give you solace in self isolation.I do not have a house right now, but in the small room that I’ve rented, there is not much to turn to except books. They’ve laid siege on my bed, my desk and everywhere else. I turn to my journal, that I sewed myself when everything was shut down. Sometimes I dance, poorly but joyfully. In my room there are two windows, and so there is enough light to give one brilliant company all day long. The terrace is right outside my room, and I make several trips to it in a day, the sky has indeed proved a constant companion and a source of comfort.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-in-a-rented-room-of-her-own/story-rYqei8HMA5OdXZU0J2g7TM.html

The meeting was convened to deliberate on issues that have cropped up due to the Covid-19 pandemic. During the meeting, the members decided that due to the scarcity of labour caused by migrant labourers going back to their home states, there is a need to keep a check to make sure that child labour is not used to meet the requirement.The commission resolved that surprise inspections need to be carried out in various industrial units and shops, especially in areas like Khuda Lahora, Raipur Kalan, Raipur Khurd and Daria. The commission has decided that inspections should be carried out by labour and social welfare departments and they have been directed to submit their report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/surprise-inspections-needed-to-keep-check-on-child-labour-chandigarh-child-rights-body/story-BEzgGY4qrYBzQ5x5FmtPDO.html

13-06-2020||Chandigarh||Fall in maize prices upset Haryana farmers, may hamper their crop diversification plans||Prospects of a rich harvest as well as crop diversification of Haryana farmers have been affected by the dip in prices of maize.In the absence of sufficient government procurement agencies, farmers are being forced to sell their produce at Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,200 per quintal to private traders while the minimum support price (MSP) of this crop was hiked to Rs 1,850 per quintal.Farmers claim that the fall in prices has caused them an estimated loss of Rs 20,000 per acre. They said the government agencies do not procure maize grown in rabi season and the lack of competition forces them to sell their produce to private traders Rs 600-Rs 700 per quintal below the MSP.The government has declared maize as the best alternative of paddy, especially in the rice belts of Kurukshetra, Karnal, Kaithal, Ambala and Yamunanagar districts, and announced cash incentives of Rs 7,000 for every acre diversified from paddy to maize.Farmers said last year, the market price was Rs 1,500 to Rs 1,600 per quintal. “The fall in prices has not only caused losses to farmers, but also discouraged them to adopt the diversification plan as the sowing of maize (kharif) begins with the harvesting of the crop sown in the rabi season,” said a commission agent.“I had grown maize on five acres and there was a bumper yield. But at this price, I am unable to recover even the input cost. Now, I have decided to sow paddy on all my land,” said a farmer, Darshan Lal, from Kurukshetra’s Ladwa. Another farmer Shahbad, Rajiv Kumar, said, “If the government has fixed the MSP, it should procure the entire produce of both rabi and kharif to provide the benefit of MSP to the farmers.”Haryana state agricultural marketing board chief administrator Sumedha Kataria said, “The government agencies begin procurement of maize from October 1 as rabi maize is not included in the procurement plan.”As per traders, the wholesale price of maize has decreased due to the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the poultry industry.“Poultry farms are the biggest consumer of maize, but they were shut due to fall in the prices of eggs and chicken. This has directly affected the prices of maize,” said a maize merchant, Krishan Lal of Yamunanagar.“Though we are purchasing maize at Rs 1,100 per quintal, there are no orders from feed producers. This has forced us to limit the amount of maize we buy from the local market,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fall-in-maize-prices-upset-haryana-farmers-may-hamper-their-crop-diversification-plans/story-bIUDpUbGDsBfCKIvj5z9eK.html

13-06-2020||City||Mullana Covid centre to only treat symptomatic patients from other dists||Amid a surge in coronavirus cases in the northern districts of Haryana, the dedicated facility in Ambala’s Mullana will now treat only symptomatic patients from other districts. The Covid care centre at MMU medical college in Mullana caters to the infected patients from Ambala, Kurukshetra, Karnal, Yamunanagar and Panchkula districts. The spurt in cases post-June 1 has left vacant only 20 out of 200 beds reserved for Covid patients at the hospital, health officials said. Hospital’s deputy medical superintendent Dr LN Garg said the decision to treat only symptomatic patients was in line with the government’s instructions. We have to spare some beds for emergency too, he added. “The state and central governments have directed the hospitals to treat only symptomatic patients and following this directive, we have asked the chief medical officers to treat asymptomatic patients in their own districts. We will obviously treat critical patients at our hospital,” Dr Garg said. On patients currently undergoing treatment at the facility, he said, “As per the health ministry’s guidelines, asymptomatic patients get discharged after 10 days of treatment. Now, such patients will be getting treatment at their home districts only and we would focus on giving better medical care to symptomatic patients.” 3 MORE CENTERS TO COME UPAmbala health department has decided to make three more Covid care centres operational in the district. Civil surgeon Dr Kuldeep Singh said, “Owing to the sudden surge in cases and fewer beds in Mullana hospital, the department has decided to activate three more Covid care facilities at Mission hospital in Ambala City and community health centers in Barara and Mullana.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mullana-covid-centre-to-only-treat-symptomatic-patients-from-other-dists/story-fIxSpUf41n0pwDOxHb14bN.html

The non-essential shops, including standalone shops or those in shopping malls, shall remain closed on Sundays. However, restaurants (only for take-home/home delivery) and liquor vends can operate till 8pm on all days. E-PASS FOR INTER-DISTRICT MOVEMENTThe release said residents will have to obtain an e-pass for inter-district movement on weekends and gazetted holidays, which would be issued only for essential work. No pass would be required for inter-district movement in case of a medical emergency. No restrictions have also been imposed on movement of vehicles carrying goods. The residents will also have to obtain an e-pass for organising functions on all the days and the pass would be issued for 50 specific persons. As per the orders issued by the state government, in addition to the Sunday closure, the deputy commissioner (DC) may choose, in consultation with the respective market associations, to order closure of the non-essential shops on any other day of the week also, especially in the high-risk areas where the number of Covis-19 cases is high. Appealing to residents, commissioner of police (CP) Rakesh Agrawal said, “If the public cooperates with the administration, then we will not have to impose more restrictions. Residents should remain inside their homes till it is necessary to move out. If possible, only a single member of the family should move out to purchase the goods and all the guidelines issued by the administration should be followed”Agrawal also went live on Ludhiana Police’s Facebook page to apprise the residents about the restrictions imposed by the administration. PANIC BUYING AT GROCERY STORESAfter the state government announced stricter lockdown on weekdays in the state, a huge rush of residents was witnessed at grocery stores across the city as residents went for panic-buying, throwing caution to the wind. A grocery store owner in Jawahar Nagar camp, Charanjeet Singh, said, “Residents went for panic buying on Friday after the announcement was made by the state government on Thursday. Long queues were witnessed outside grocery stores.”Rumours are also making rounds on social networks that the government might again announce a complete lockdown or curfew in the state due to a large number of positive coronavirus cases being reported. However, the administration has appealed to residents not to resort to panic buying. There has been no restriction on the industry under the latest lockdown order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-restriction-on-movement-of-residents-from-5am-to-9pm-within-district-on-weekends-ludhiana-admn/story-b0skrFdX6lFOQoypWeBNJJ.html
13-06-2020||Chandigarh||Realty market dives in Mohali as Covid-19 blues hit home||Builders in Mohali were desperately waiting for a miracle earlier this year after a decade-long slowdown, hoping for some improvement in the realty market. But that was before the Covid-19 outbreak.With more than two months under lockdown, medical and economic uncertainty overshadowing every aspect of life, buying a house now is not on people’s priority list.This is why demand has hit a new low with property prices dipping by at least 10% from the beginning of the year, says Tejinder Singh Punia, former president, Mohali Property Consultant Association.Mohali, particularly its peripheral areas of Zirakpur, Kharar, and New Chandigarh (Mullanpur), has been the tricity’s development hub in the recent past. Since last year, with Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) led IT City and Aero City projects, Airport Road too was coming up as a prominent realty destination.PANDEMIC BLUES“People have lost their jobs, the education sector has closed down and the hospitality sector has been hit badly. People don’t have the money to invest in property. Only those who were already in the market before pandemic hit have become active again,” says Punia.“The Covid-19 pandemic has hit the homebuyer’s capacity to buy. With no income inflow, the outbreak has also severely restricted builders’ ability to create new supply. Completion of older projects, for many, will be tough now,” says LC Mittal, director, Motia Group.No action is likely this year, in stark contrast to a slew of projects launched last year. “Builders will focus on delivery as ready-to-move products become more important. In fact, in the next couple of years, we don’t estimate many new project launches,” says Amit Mittal, director, Green Lotus Group.Liquidity crunch, rising costs of construction material and exodus of migrant workers from the state are contracting supply creation. “Builders have lost 50% to 100% of their migrant workers since inter-state transport was allowed. Even though labourers want to come back now, it will take some time before construction schedules normalise,” says Amit.In a district where housing project delays are endemic, buyers don’t expect delivery anytime soon. “Even before the pandemic, it was taking time for possession of plots, now builders can justify the delay because of Covid-19,” says a homebuyer in a New Chandigarh based housing project, requesting anonymity. Also, with restrictions on inter-state movement yet to be completely lifted, people from other states are unable to come in from neighbouring states, especially Himachal Pradesh, which has the largest chunk of buyers in New Chandigarh and Zirakpur areas.CAUTIOUS OPTIMISMBuilders, however, are optimistic of a quick turnaround as home loan interests are at their lowest in nearly two decades. They foresee a move from rentals to house ownership fuelling the demand.The phased lockdown relaxations and Unlock-1 measures have opened up the sector for business. “Buyer queries are coming in. End-users are now looking for only ready-to-move property. There are no investors,” says Bhupinder Singh Sabharwal, president, Mohali Property Consultant Association.In the pre-covid-19 period, banks were offering home loans at more than 8%. “Now the rates have dipped below 7%. Interest rates are expected to fall further, making it cheaper to buy a house. For people living in rented homes in Chandigarh and Panchkula it will make better financial sense to pay home loan EMIs instead of monthly rentals. Builders with ready-to-move properties stand to gain the most,” says Prateek Mittal, executive director, Sushma Group.The uncertainty created because of pandemic will push people, especially with many people working from home now, to opt for house ownership over rented houses, he adds.Tanu Kashyap, chief administrator, GMADA, is also determined to promote activity in the sector. “After the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, we are taking very considerate view of requests from different industry stakeholders. The Punjab government has already announced a slew of concessions and incentives for the industry. Similarly, more regulatory and policy changes are in the works, and will be announced in due time. GMADA will also be offering properties in the near future to promote business activity in the sector.”NOT BUSINESS AS USUALProperty viewing is also changing. For instance, builders are allowing buyer visits to offices and project sites through appointments. “Walk-in buyers are allowed, but they have to wait longer now with social distancing norms allowing only a limited number of people to assemble in office,” says Amit.The need for spacious houses, and self-dependency in the wake of Covid-19, is also pushing demand in new segments. “Significantly, we are receiving increasing queries for land purchase for building farmhouses, which can allow organic farming too. Land prices have already fallen by at least 20%,”says Punia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/realty-market-dives-in-mohali-as-covid-19-blues-hit-home/story-n7Lv6HHlSy4acInwpvSwDM.html
13-06-2020||Chandigarh||PU exams in July: Student bodies up in arms||Activists of National Students of India (NSUI) protested outside the vice-chancellor’s office on Friday against Panjab University’s plan to conduct semester examinations.PU is planning to hold examinations in July. However, the final decision has not been made yet. Many student organisations have expressed their discontentment with the varsity’s plans amid surging cases of Covid-19.Nikhil Narmeta, president of NSUI, PU, said, “We demand that the university not conduct semester examinations under the current circumstances. They should follow other educational institutes of the country who have decided to evaluate students on other criteria.”The students also submitted a representation to vice-chancellor Raj Kumar, which stated that students belonging to different states cannot come to the campus to take their exams. Besides, syllabus had not been completed amid the lockdown, it added. PU’s dean university instructions (DUI) K Singla had earlier said that the university is preparing to conduct examinations but they will be held when the directives of the government are received to open educational institutes in the country. Meanwhile, Students For Society (SFS) also submitted a memorandum to the vice-chancellor on Friday and sought cancellation of examinations. SFS president Varinder said, “The university should not mock the education system by limiting it to examinations without any teaching. Most students lack proper facilities for online education.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-students-organisations-up-in-arms-over-examinations/story-xwDdVNEJytfwU3NXHSYDKM.html

13-06-2020||City||Mohali MC in a fix over maintenance of parks||With the Punjab local bodies department not allocating fund to the Mohali municipal corporation for maintenance of parks, and the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) already having refused, the civic body is in a fix as it is going through a huge financial crunch.On Thursday, the local bodies department approved Rs 127-crore budget against the proposed Rs 268 crore for 2020-21, but did not allocate any funds for the maintenance of 540 parks in the city.The nationwide lockdown amid the Covid-19 pandemic has further aggravated the MC’s woes as economic activities, which could generate funds for the civic body, that has now has suffered a loss of Rs 13 crore, have come to a standstill.As per an agreement in 2017, GMADA was to pay Rs 5 crore to the MC every year for the maintenance of parks and the total amount fixed was Rs 50 crore. But, in the last three years, GMADA has only paid Rs 9 crore .A senior officer of MC, on the condition of anonymity, said, “We don’t know how to deal with the situation as we don’t have funds to maintain parks. We will take up the matter with authorities concerned again and hope it will be sorted out. Otherwise, we will be forced to give the parks back to GMADA.” GMADA PUTS ONUS ON MCOn the other hand, a senior GMADA official said, “In 2017, it was decided that besides taking over 540 parks, the MC will take over all parks in Sectors 76 to 80. But, they have not procured the public properties so far. In such a case, why should we pay the money? As far as other maintenance works are concerned, the civic body carries them out independently. Amid the issue, we are reviewing the agreement signed with the MC.”RWAs IN ANGUISHStrong resentment prevails among the members of all 65 residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) of Mohali against the MC. CL Garg, president of the Confederation of Greater Mohali RWAs, the apex body of 65 RWAs, said, “We have been paying gardeners out of our own pocket for the past three months. Now, the MC has assured they will clear our dues,” he said.The civic body pays the RWAs Rs 2.45 per square metre per month for the maintenance of around 56 acre park land, which comes to around Rs 6 lakh per month. MC makes the payment by seventh of each month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-mc-in-a-fix-over-maintenance-of-parks/story-fRWKioNne8DuS2urN0avtJ.html
13-06-2020||Chandigarh||No let-up in Covid-19 cases, Chandigarh suspends inter-state bus services||With the Covid-19 cases continuing to rise in Chandigarh, the UT administration on Friday decided to shut down all inter-state bus services among a slew of measures to keep a tab on the outsiders coming to the city.The administration has also intensified screening at the airport, bus stands and railway station, and made it mandatory for outsiders to share their information when travelling to the city, besides recommending 14-day self-quarantine for them.The decision to suspend the inter-state buses comes only two days after the Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) resumed its long-route bus services.The UT transport department, on Friday, wrote to the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, stating, “In view of the increase in number of cases of Covid-19, it has been decided by the Chandigarh administration that the inter-state operation of the CTU and other STUs (state transport undertakings) will remain suspended in Chandigarh from June 13 till June 30.”TRICITY BUS SERVICE TO CONTINUEHowever, CTU will continue to operate its buses within the tricity.“Our focus is on people coming from areas of high incidence of positive cases. In the tricity, the problem is not acute as Delhi. Also, it is not possible to stop the entry of people from Panchkula and Mohali, as Chandigarh is a common capital and their offices and businesses are here. So, the CTU tricity service will continue,” said UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida.TRACKING OUTSIDER MOVEMENTPeople coming to Chandigarh from outside, except those from Mohali and Panchkula, must carry a self-declaration document, which can be downloaded from the UT administration’s website. It is already mandatory for train and air passengers.This will help the administration keep track of their travel and area of residence, said a senior UT official.“This document is not a permit. It will simply be a travel information document for official record. It will not be applicable for tricity residents,” said Parida.Government/PSU/private employees coming to attend office will be allowed entry on production of identity cards.SCREENING PASSENGERSA meeting of the tricity coordination committee meeting was held here on Friday to streamline coordination among the three towns, particularly with regards to screening of passengers. Along with senior UT officials, Mohali deputy commissioner (DC) Girish Dayalan and Panchkula DC MK Ahuja attended the meeting.It was decided that both Haryana and Chandigarh authorities will screen passengers at the Chandigarh railway station, while at the Chandigarh International Airport, the existing system of screening by Punjab government will continue. Regarding screening of bus passengers, all three districts agreed that thermal screening will be done at the time of boarding the buses. This is currently being done at multiple points.All three deputy commissioners were advised to maintain regular coordination, so that locals do not suffer during travel and visitors coming from outside, are properly screened and checked, to prevent infection.MAJOR TAKEAWAYSNo long-route inter-state buses to ply from and to ChandigarhCTU to continue service within tricityOutsiders, except those from Mohali and Panchkula, to fill information forms before entering ChandigarhScreening at railway station to be done by both Haryana and ChandigarhBus passengers to be screened at the time of boarding at their respective locationsAll passengers coming by trains, road, and domestic flights advised self-quarantine for 14 days on arrival as before.They need to download the Aarogya Setu application and input self-assessment details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-let-up-in-covid-19-cases-chandigarh-suspends-inter-state-bus-services/story-NDfodQtkSdMVQsOFeEvFQL.html

Three cases each were reported from Khudda Jassu and Daria village, while four are from Bapu Dham Colony and one from Khudda Lohara, raising concerns over the spread of infection in city’s densely populated areas. The Khudda Lohara resident, a 28-year-old auto driver, is a community contact of an already positive patient from Khudda Jassu. The auto driver had transported the patient to Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16.Three other cases are the family members of a work contact of the 35-year-old chemist from Sector 16. These include two females, aged 35 and eight, and an 18-month-old child. The family lives in Khudda Jassu. The chemist’s worker was found infected previously.Three family contacts of two Covid-19 positive cases, who were visiting Daria village from New Delhi, have also contracted the infection.They are three females, aged 24 days, and 26 and 48 years. The two positive patients, who are brothers and hail from New Delhi, were visiting the in-laws of one them in Daria village.

The system – Captain Arjun – is also equipped with sensor-based sanitizers and mask dispensers and the railways is also likely to introduce it at stations in Mumbai.If the system finds the temperature of a passenger high while screening, it is equipped to raise an alarm to inform the railway authorities. Captain Arjun is also equipped with two cameras and artificial intelligence, which is aimed at tracking suspicious activities, amid the fast movement of passengers in the station. A siren would go off whenever any suspicious activity is detected. It can sanitise floors.“The robotic systems will help in minimising human contact during thermal screenings. We are looking to introduce a similar system on railway stations in Mumbai,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relation officers, CR.The zonal railway also recently introduced Automated Ticket Checking and Managing Access (ATMA) machines for passengers at Nagpur railway station to conduct thermal screenings of passengers and check railway tickets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fight-against-covid-19-cr-s-robot-to-screen-commuters-at-pune-railway-station-for-fever/story-wQPWJhq1KjOP8audtbJYTI.html
13-06-2020||Chandigarh||2-lakh kg of illicit liquor seized in Rupnagar, five arrested along HP border||The Ropar police on Friday arrested five people and seized what it called the “biggest-ever” quantity of material for illicit liquor in a 10-hour operation in forested terrain in Himachal Pradesh villages. The operation was carried out in collaboration with the Bilaspur police. Seven working stills (apparatus used for the distillation of liquids) and 2-lakh kg of ‘lahan’ (from which illicit liquor is distilled after fermentation) were seized from Majir and Dabt villages on the Punjab-Himachal border in Bilaspur district.Due to dense forest, the area is notorious for smuggling of illegal liquor for the past many decades. The police had to cut through dense and thorny undergrowth to get to the spot, said Ropar senior superintendent of police Swapan Sharma.The teams cordoned off the entire area around the villages, located about two km from the Punjab border, said the SSP, adding the search operation covered a six-km stretch along the inter-state border.Investigations were in progress to trace further links of the accused across Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, Sharma said.The seizure came amid state-wide efforts by Punjab Police, under the directives of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, to check illicit liquor trading, as well as smuggling of liquor from across the state’s borders.The smugglers take advantage of the forest cover and the lack of access in the tough terrain to sneak from Himachal Pradesh into Punjab with their hauls. In the last five years, 26 cases in Punjab and 38 cases in Himachal have been registered against people hailing from these areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2-lakh-kg-of-illicit-liquor-seized-in-rupnagar-five-arrested-along-hp-border/story-LhtNpGsGv2pxck5EoNLMVM.html

13-06-2020||Mumbai||Allow burials of Christian Covid patients’ bodies in all cemeteries: Mumbai civic corporation||The civic body on Thursday issued a circular, directing all Christian cemeteries across the city to accept bodies of Covid 19 patients. The development comes around a month after HT first reported that the family of a 61-year-old Christian woman from Mahim, who died of Covid-19, was forced to cremate her body because the cemetery refused to allow her burial.Members of the community contended that according to their religious practices, a body cannot be cremated and needs to be buried and that forced cremations hurt their religious sentiments. They also demanded that there should be ‘respectful burial’ of such bodies according to the religious practices.In the circular, issued by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), signed by executive health office and assistant health officer (birth death), health officers across all the wards have been instructed to allow disposal of bodies as per guidelines of disposal issued by Government of India.“As per the orders passed by Hon High Court, in view of the findings of the World Health Organization coupled with the orders passed by the Hon High Court has observed and clarified that there is no harm of whatsoever nature to the citizen, if Covid-19 deceased person is buried with proper precaution,” reads the circular, a copy of which is with HT.The circular also adds that the burial grounds should be large enough so as to not create a possibility of spread of virus in the neighbouring areas.Despite repeated attempts, BMC’s executive health officer Padmaja Keskar did not respond to HT’s call till the time of going to press.Spokesperson from Archdiocese of Bombay said that if BMC passed an order, they would abide by it and all the cemeteries will follow the guidelines issued by them.“We haven’t received a copy of the order yet. Once we receive it, we will circulate it. If there are all guidelines in place, it will be easy for us to follow, otherwise we will seek clarity from them,” said the spokespersonArchdiocese of Bombay has around five lakh members under its jurisdiction. There are 122 churches of Roman Catholic denomination across Mumbai, Thane, Raigad and Mahad, with around 60 cemeteries attached to them.A day after HT’s report, BMC listed four cemeteries where bodies of Christians who die of Covid-19 can be buried. However, the community members demanded that all cemeteries should accept bodies of Covid-19 patients.On May 21, BMC allowed the burial of a Covid-19 patient at a designated cemetery, which was the first burial of a member from the Christian community who died of the virus, as other coronavirus patients were cremated as per protocol.“For the past three weeks, we have been running from pillar to post to ensure that all Christians get respectful burial. I came across 15-16 burials in the past three weeks, for which we had to fight, and around three were forcefully cremated. Despite BMC issuing a list of four cemeteries, two of them were not accepting burials outright. Hopefully, now all cemeteries accept these bodies,” said Cyril Dara, church activist, who fought for burials.The Bombay high court had observed that there was no scientific data to support the claim that Covid-19 can spread through dead bodies and that the BMC had all the authority to demarcate the cemetery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/allow-burials-of-christian-covid-patients-bodies-in-all-cemeteries-bmc/story-c8UD1vJ7p4OzfYraUWpeoO.html
13-06-2020||City||Office goers from Dombivli, Kalyan say they have to wait in bus queues for 2 hours||With the state government re-opening establishments early this week, office goers from Dombivli, Kalyan and Badlapur are struggling to commute to their workplaces. From standing in long bus queues for couple of hours to spending a huge amount on a more secure mode of commute, office goers said they have been witnessing a harrowing experience.Since Monday, as many offices have begun functioning with 10% staff, most of the employees from the suburbs of Kalyan, Dombivli, Ambernath and Badlapur have been travelling to Mumbai to reach to their workplaces. With local trains still not operational, office goers have to depend on state transport and private buses.Sahil Nakhwa, 36, a Badlapur resident, has to travel to Ghatkopar every day for work. “It is very chaotic at the bus stops or depots, as we have to wait in queue for almost two hours. There is no social distancing followed because the stops are very crowded. Although I am worried about my health, I will get paid only if I reach go to work. So I have no option but to take the bus. Even after getting into a bus, we travel for almost four hours one way every day,” said Nakhwa.The Thane traffic police too have said that they have been dealing traffic snarls as commuters only have the option commuting by road.Amit Kale, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Thane, said, “To control the traffic, we have regulated timings of heavy vehicles from 12pm to 4pm, and 11pm to 5am only. Moreover, as people are not allowed to venture out at night, we have a special night patrol team to monitor movement. The traffic during peak hours is more towards Mumbai and Navi Mumbai; however, we are keeping an eye out on the permissible limit of passengers in all vehicles,” Amit Kale said.Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses have been plying state government employees to Mantralaya. “We operate on one route to Mantralaya. Some buses begin from Badlapur, some from Kalyan and Thane. Every day, there are around 400 to 600 trips made on this route,” said an MSRTC official.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has announced that the state is trying to resume train services for those in essential services. This has raised questions on when the services for the train services would commence for those in non-essential services. The railway passengers association claimed that most offices are calling more than 10-15% employees, which will require crowd control and monitoring.Lata Argade, secretary, Suburban Railway Passengers Association, said, “There needs to be some control executed over the office attendance. Ten percent staff in every office as per rules is permitted. However, no one ensures if any workplace is calling more employees than the permitted limit. The crowd will be regulated only if establishments follow the 10% guideline or else people will continue to suffer.”However, not all office goers are keen on the resumption of local train services. They instead say that there should be an increase in the frequency of buses. “It is not safe to allow local trains yet, but more buses services will definitely help in reducing the queues at bus stops and depots,” said Dipti Sawant, 29, a Kalyan resident who travels to Ghansoli for work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/office-goers-from-dombivli-kalyan-say-they-have-to-wait-in-bus-queues-for-2-hours/story-0yDWWwMkiLenzyyTGH425I.html
13-06-2020||Mumbai||Despite lockdown, 85% Class 10 and Class 12 papers of Maharashtra board evaluated||Despite several hurdles that came in their way due to the Covid-19 outbreak and the lockdown, the Mumbai divisional board has successfully received 85% of the answer sheets of higher secondary certificate (HSC) and secondary school certificate (SSC) exams after evaluation and moderation. Sandeep Sangave, secretary, Mumbai divisional board, said that the remaining papers are also expected to reach the board in the next couple of days. “Majority of the papers have been submitted to our centres and to the board office, but in some places where travel restrictions were in place, it was becoming tough to transport papers. The board has now received the state government’s permission to operate as an essential service, and we hope that all the remaining work gets completed soon,” he added. The Mumbai division, which also consists of Thane, Raigad and Palghar, has the most number of students appearing for board exams among the nine divisions in the state. This year, 3.39 lakh students registered for the Class 12 HSC exams, while 3.91 lakh students registered for the Class 10 SSC exams from Mumbai division. A total of 42 lakh answer sheets were corrected and moderated from the division this year. With the lockdown in place since March, several answer sheets of the board exams were stuck in exam custodies, schools and homes of evaluators and moderators. On May 5, the state education department granted special permission for teachers and board staff to travel with answer sheets during the lockdown to ensure that the evaluation work is not affected. The divisional board made several changes in its functioning to ensure that evaluation work is not affected, even as Mumbai accounted for maximum number of cases in the state. This academic year, the board did several things to make the evaluation process easy. First, it increased the number of paper submission centres and allowed moderators to submit papers at any nearby centre, instead of their designated centres. It also arranged for transport for its staff to come to work. It also allowed for reimbursements to teachers for their travel expenditure, even if they travelled by taxi or car for collecting or submitting answer sheets, as public transport was not operational at the time. The board also created a single-step paper submission process where teachers can give their evaluated and moderated papers just once without having to go back anywhere. The board also exempted a teacher from moderation responsibility after she had tested positive for Covid-19. “While the overall attendance in the office was thin in the first few weeks, it is now picking up and teachers are coming regularly, making it easy for us to finish work early,” added Sangave.How does the process work?1. Students write their examinations at the respective centres and submit their answersheets in the exam hall. 2. From the exam hall, the papers are taken to designated custodies where papers from a few centres come in. 3. Papers are transported from custodies to respective schools of the examiners who have been assigned evaluation duties. 4. Examiners check papers and send them to the moderator (who is a senior teacher) who then checks if evaluation has happened as per the board policy. 5. Moderators then submit the answersheets to the collection centres assigned to them. 6. Papers from collection centres are sent to the Mumbai Divisional Board’s office in Vashi.7. After all papers come in, the divisional board sends counter slips (from the answersheets) to the State Board office in Pune.8. Data of students’ marks is collated by the divisional board including concessions, grace marks etc. and is sent to the state board. 9. Data is processed, errors are identified and removed and results are declared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/despite-lockdown-85-ssc-and-hsc-papers-evaluated/story-qbe2dULliC5sF3nGeU424J.html

Residents of Omkar Rahiwasi Seva Sangh colony in Kalachowki greeted Nilima Zore with flowers when she returned from BYL Nair Hospital, where she’d been admitted after testing positive for Covid-19.Zore’s husband is a retired employee of Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited and the couple have a son and a daughter. Zore had an angioplasty in 2014 and has needed dialysis since 2018. She contracted Covid-19 in May. “I would regularly take my mother for dialysis to Hinduja Hospital in a family friend’s private vehicle, but due to the lockdown, we took a taxi on May 8. The next day I had fever and the day after, my mother too developed symptoms. We immediately got tested. My mother tested positive for Covid-19 on the third test while I tested positive in the second test,” said Ankita, Zore’s daughter.On May 15, Zore was admitted to Nair Hospital, which also has a dialysis facility. Ankita was quarantined at a civic quarantine centre in the Saat Rasta area and later shifted to a Covid care centre at Nagpada for more treatment.“On the first day in hospital, I thought that now I would never return home. But my family, society members supported me and the doctors too helped me gain confidence,” said Zore. She was discharged on Thursday after she tested negative for Covid-19 on Wednesday.A 56-year-old patient with a chronic kidney disease, recovered from Covid-19 after 26 days and was warmly welcomed home on Thursday. Residents of Omkar Rahiwasi Seva Sangh colony in Rangari Badak Chawl area, in Kalachowki, greeted Nilima Harishchandra Zore with flowers and chanted “Ganpati Bappa Morya” when she returned from BYL Nair Hospital.Zore’s husband is a retired employee of Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited and the couple have a son and a daughter. Zore had an angioplasty in 2014 and has needed dialysis since 2018. She contracted Covid-19 in May. “I would regularly take my mother for dialysis to Hinduja Hospital in a family friend’s private vehicle, but due to the lockdown, we were forced to take a taxi on May 8. The next day I had fever and the day after, my mother too developed symptoms such as fever, vomiting, cold, cough and sore throat. We immediately got tested at Hinduja Hospital. Initially, the reports were negative, but my mother tested positive for Covid-19 on the third test while I tested positive in the second test,” said Ankita, Zore’s daughter.On May 15, with the help of Omkar Rahiwasi Seva Sangh colony’s society members, Zore was admitted to Nair Hospital, which also has a dialysis facility. Ankita was quarantined at a civic quarantine centre in the Saat Rasta area and later shifted to a Covid care centre at Nagpada for more treatment.Zore and her family worried about her chances of survival since patients with chronic illnesses are more vulnerable to Covid-19. “On the first day in hospital, I thought that now I would never return home. But my family, society members supported me and the doctors too helped me gain confidence,” said Zore. Soon, Ankita said, Zore was the one sending her family reassuring messages, “From hospital, my mother used to tell the family that we need not worry as she would be fine soon and we would soon together go to our village to celebrate Ganeshotsav,” said Ankita.While Zore battled the infection in hospital, her family faced challenges at home. “Forget about helping someone in such a crisis, some neighbours troubled us repeatedly by calling civic personnel and making false complaints about my family not following quarantine rules. But society members helped my family and my entire family is very grateful to them,” said Ankita.Dayanand Ghadigaonkar, society president at the colony, said “No one in past had seen problem of such contagious infection, so no one actually knew how to deal with such situation. But we stood by the family.”Zore was discharged on Thursday after she tested negative for Covid-19 on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/56-year-old-mumbai-woman-with-kidney-ailment-defeats-coronavirus/story-wgVjgrFQodU1Z7josIB9JI.html

The CM described the initiative a tool for early detection and testing to prevent community spread.Additional chief secretary (health) Anurag Agarwal said all above 30 years of age shall be surveyed as part of the drive, besides those with comorbidity or influenza-like illness/acute respiratory illness.This will be ongoing process till the containment of Covid-19, said Agarwal.The database through survey will help the government plan better and make targeted interventions for the community. Apart from this, the survey shall give better direction to all state health programmes, he said. Special secretary, health-cum-testing in-charge for Covid, Isha Kalia, said the user-friendly app was developed and designed in-house by the health department. The field tests were done in Patiala and Mansa, during which around 20,628 people were surveyed, of whom 9,045 were found to be asymptomatic and 1,583 with symptoms.The survey is currently underway in 518 villages and 47 urban wards.

13-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police’s Covid-19 count crosses 2,000 mark||The number of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai Police crossed the 2,000-mark on Thursday, with the total count now at 2,028. Twenty-two personal have also died of the virus until Thursday. Currently, 516 infected personal are undergoing treatment in Covid care centres across the city, while 224 are admitted to hospitals. Among the infected personnel, 290 are officers, while the remaining ones (1,738) are from the constabulary.2 constables on migrant workers’ duty test positiveTwo constables posted at the deputy commissioner of police (DCP) port zone’s office at Ballard Pier have tested positive for Covid-19. Both are 40 years old and have been shifted to the Covid Care Centre (CCC) at Marol. According to the police, they used to collect details from the migrants and prepare lists to send them back to their respective states. On June 8, one of them suffered from fever and found it difficult to breath. He underwent a swab test and was found positive for Covid-19, following which around 15 staffers from the port zone office also took the test, in which another constable was tested positive on Wednesday, said an officer. Both the constables are in a stable condition and the police are trying to find their close contacts.334 recovered, back on dutyA statement released by the police on Friday said that 1,233 of the 2,028 personnel have recovered, of whom 334 are already back on duty. Deputy commissioner of police (operations) Pranay Ashok said that after coronavirus cases started rising in the force, immediate effective measures such as opening a Covid-19 care helpline for police to inquire on bed availability, setting up of four dedicated CCCs, creating awareness about sanitisation, strict adherence to social distancing and provision of financial and moral support to the personnel were undertaken. “These measures are now yielding results and it has expedited the recording pace of infected cops,” Ashok added.38 CCCs for cops in stateThe state police have developed 38 dedicated CCCs for police, with a total capacity of 2,200 beds. These centres are in addition to the ones in four centres at Mumbai, and are set-up at Thane, Pune, Nagpur and Malegaon, where a maximum number of cases have been reported. Assistant inspector general of police (law and order) Vinayak Deshmukh said more centres would be developed if required in the future.Cyber police acts against rumour mongers The state cyber police on Friday said that they have intensified their vigil on social media platforms, as many are from the past two days spreading fake news of the lockdown being extended in the state. The police asked the citizens to not to believe in any information coming from an unofficial source and have warned of strict action against those forwarding such content to others.Lounge owner booked for allowing pizza party Oshiwara police booked the owner, manager and a Waiter of a lounge in Jogeshwari after a late night pizza party was organised at the lounge. Assistant inspector Nitin Gije of Oshiwara police station said, “As the lounge was found violating lockdown norms, we booked its owner and two others under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the relevant sections of the Epidemic Act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-s-covid-19-count-crosses-2-000-mark/story-CRZPUKo2U6JmW0gvt6zuuN.html
13-06-2020||City||Maharashtra’s social justice minister Dhananjay Munde tests positive for Covid-19||State social justice minister Dhananjay Munde tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday and was admitted to a private hospital within hours of his diagnosis. He is stable and asymptomatic. Munde is the third minister from the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to test positive for Covid-19.“We conducted two tests, one came negative but another confirmed he is positive. I had a telephonic conversation with him. He is fine and asymptomatic but has very minor breathing problem, hence we decided to admit him to a city hospital,” health minister Rajesh Tope told reporters. A number of Munde’s staff, including his secretaries, driver and cook, also tested positive for Covid-19.Munde had attended a state cabinet meeting on Tuesday and Tope said other ministers who were at the meeting would also be tested and quarantined if they show any symptoms of Covid-19. “We are strictly following the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) guidelines, which clearly state tests can be conducted only if a person develops symptoms. If anyone develops symptoms, they will be quarantined and tested,” he said.Earlier, housing minister Jitendra Awhad and public works department minister Ashok Chavan had tested positive for Covid-19. Both have since recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-s-social-justice-minister-dhananjay-munde-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-0IAL8wAX22TNkHJcAbpF6K.html
13-06-2020||City||Don’t believe rumours, we have not decided to reimpose lockdown: Maharashtra CM||With rumours circulating on social media that the state government was planning to impose lockdown restrictions in the state once again, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray clarified on Friday that no such decision has been taken. While Mission Begin Again has relaxed some restrictions on movement, Thackeray appealed to citizens to follow lockdown norms to help curb the spread of Covid-19.On Friday, messages started making rounds on social media about the state government in Maharashtra re-imposing the lockdown from next week. In response to these rumours, the chief minister’s office issued a statement on Friday morning, dispelling these speculations.“There are rumours being spread on social media and reports on some [news] channels that the state government has taken a decision to impose lockdown by shutting down all shops and commercial establishments. We have not taken any such decision. Such reports create confusion among people. Spreading such false news is a violation of the law and should not be transmitted without confirmation,” read the statement.On Wednesday, Thackeray had said the state may be forced to impose the lockdown again if people did not follow lockdown norms. “The threat of Covid-19 has not passed, it still persists. As we continue to battle pandemic, we cannot put brakes on the wheels of the economy. We were shocked looking at the crowd on the first day. Outdoor physical activities are permitted for your good health and not to spoil it. People will have to keep physical distance. The government is evaluating the situation. If we feel that the lifting of lockdown is life-threatening, then we will be forced to impose the lockdown again,” he had said.In the statement released on Friday, Thackeray said that relaxation of restrictions should not be taken as leave to ignore distancing norms and other preventive measures. “Lifting of the lockdown norms does not mean people are allowed to step out, leading to crowding at public places and which could prove hazardous for health. Maintaining social distancing, masking the face and sanitisation at regular intervals should be adopted now as part of one’s lifestyle. Everybody should self-discipline for their own health and that of their close ones,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/don-t-believe-rumours-we-have-not-decided-to-reimpose-lockdown-maharashtra-cm/story-Sz21H6N6XE2hsmTXk7e7XP.html
13-06-2020||Mumbai||‘State and Centre trying hard, but didn’t spread awareness about community risk’||As the state hit the one lakh mark for Covid-19 cases on Friday, Dr Satyajit Rath, retired scientist from Delhi-based National Institute of Immunology, and currently adjunct professor at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune, spoke on factors behind the rise in Covid-19 cases, state’s handling of the outbreak and public health care system. Excerpts:What are the factors responsible for the large number of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra and Mumbai?Globally, much of Sars-CoV-2 transmission seems to be ‘direct’, meaning from being in close proximity to an infected person. Since the entry of the infection into India is from overseas, it is quite unsurprising that the high-volume international entry points, Mumbai and Delhi, have had most ‘seeding’ of local outbreaks. When that is coupled with crowded urban conditions, especially in Mumbai, again, the number and size of local outbreaks are unsurprising, as also the outcome that infection has spread to surrounding areas (western Maharashtra, Gurgaon) from these initial seeding points. These are not really ‘huge’ numbers, given the numbers some other countries with early high-volume outbreaks have had and continue to have. The pandemic is going to be with us in fits and starts for a long time.Has the state done enough to contain the epidemic?The state (the Centre and Maharashtra government) is trying hard, and with good intentions, and acknowledges and tries to act on evidence-based directions and approaches needed (unlike the government leaderships in the two countries ahead of India – Brazil and the USA). It also acknowledges some of its own limitations and shortcomings.And the inadequacies?The state has failed to address the core issue, which is to build a community partnership in which there is clarity about the fact that the pandemic is not so much an individually lethal risk as a community risk. The result is stigmatisation, ostracisation, fear and concealment, disruption of non-Covid-related health services and their usage (children’s vaccinations, other non-pandemic illness handling, et cetera), and the like. The state has not built robust and generous public support structures for the underprivileged anywhere near the extent needed. What is your assessment of the public health infrastructure?The state (the Centre and Maharashtra government), most directly, have not yet acknowledged the sad state of public health care systems, especially at community level. It is a contributor to the quantitatively inadequate pandemic response. As a simple example, the general consensus globally is that for efficient community-based Covid-19 case identification and contact tracing, one skilled and trained health worker will be needed per three thousand people. This kind and level of manpower in neighbourhoods, backed up with infrastructure, data handling, and testing-technical capacity, was not available before the pandemic, has not been aimed at so far, and is not being built for the future.Data shows that the state has been carrying out about 14,000 tests everyday as against the testing capacity of 38,000. It’s a similar case with Mumbai too. Should we be testing more? Given these numbers, it is quite likely that larger numbers of testing would help; more tests will still likely identify more cases. However, a major issue has come to be; how easy is it to get tested, and how clear, supportive and unthreatening are the practical decision streams for what is to be done if ‘the test comes positive’ and how it is to be done?What has been the consequence of constant changes in testing criteria by Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR)? The major consequence is that it becomes difficult if not impossible to compare data from testing under one set of criteria with data from testing under another set. This makes it hard to say anything much about the trajectory of the epidemic in the country. However, it is also true that ICMR has had to work in practical constraints of test and related resource (swabs, transport) availability, and of changing case numbers.How do you gauge the potential impact following the easing of lockdown restrictions in Maharashtra/Mumbai? It is quite likely that numbers will go up with a delay of a week or two, especially because there is no cultural assimilation in the community of the need for physical distancing (not social distancing; we need social solidarity). Case numbers are most likely to go up, not in some orderly and well-distributed fashion, but as increasing numbers of local, scattered outbreaks.Suggestions to control further spread of the infection and revive the economy range from a ban on gathering of more than two or five people, enforcement of a stringent containment strategy and cyclical lockdown. Your comments. A single strategy won’t work everywhere, all the time. All of these and more are likely to be invoked and used, in reactive fashion, in different local situations at different times. It would be helpful if some systematic analytical thought has been given to identifying which local circumstances would warrant which of these containment approaches; I do not know if governments are doing this kind of planning.What is the takeaway, three months into the pandemic?Unless we persuade ourselves, culturally, as a community, that physical distancing and social solidarity need to become the ‘new normal’, and unless we re-commit ourselves, as a representative government, to the idea of major, long-term, durable investment in comprehensive public health systems as a core responsibility of governance, the outcomes of the pandemic are likely to be bleak for us.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-and-centre-trying-hard-but-didn-t-spread-awareness-about-community-risk/story-9MKh0Flaf5C5XafIoQ7PbN.html
13-06-2020||Chandigarh||HC asks Punjab to decide on security to Bir Devinder in 10 days||The Punjab and Haryana high court has asked Punjab government to decide on security cover to Shiromani Akali Dal (Taksali) leader Bir Devinder Singh. Singh had filed a contempt petition in the high court stating that he was provided security in 2013 which resulted in court disposing of a plea on security cover issue. However, the security cover was subsequently withdrawn.He had told court that in spite of the threat perception still existing, the security has been withdrawn only because of his criticism of the policies and decisions of the state government. The high court bench of justice Nirmaljit Kaur has asked the state to consider this contempt plea as his representation and decide accordingly within 10 days. Two cops get bail in Moose Wala firing case The Punjab and Haryana high court has granted interim bail to two cops accused in an FIR involving singer Sidhu Moose Wala. The high court bench of justice Anil Kshetarpal granted the interim protection, asking constable Gagandeep Singh and constable Harvinder Singh to join probe as and when called by police. The bench also asked for a status report from the Barnala and Sangrur SSPs.Singer Sidhu Moose Wala was booked under Section 188 of the IPC and 51 of the Disaster Management Act on May 4 by Barnala police after he was shown in a video firing from an official assault rifle.

13-06-2020||Mumbai||Not enough Covid tests in Maha, say experts||If experts are to be believed, the number of positive patients in Maharashtra may be much higher than the one-lakh-mark it crossed on Friday, as the state is testing to only 39% of their daily capacity. The state government, however, says there is no need for random testing.In March, when the state reported its first case of novel coronavirus, only one laboratory— National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune – was conducting the tests. Now, after 94 days of the outbreak of the virus, the number of testing labs in the state has increased to 97, an addition of almost one lab per day. Of these, 57 are government laboratories, while the remaining private. This has increased the total testing capacity to 38,000 samples per day. But an analysis of the data done by HT shows, despite having the testing facilities, the state is conducting a maximum of 15,000 tests per day.In the past 10 days, the testing capacity has increased by 26%. On June 2, 12,440 tests were conducted, which increased to 13,793 the next day. It fell slightly to 12,559 on June 4, but increased to 12,866 on June 5 and surged further to 14,007 the next day. However, on June 8, 12,227 tests were done which gradually increased to 14,004 on June 9 and 15,988 on June 10. The next day, 15,508 tests were done, and a slight increase was recorded on June 12 with 15,731 cases. Currently, 19 of every 100 tests come positive. According to experts, if the state had done daily tests to their maximum capacity, the number of positive cases would have gone above one lakh earlier.“Testing should be the only mantra to identify carriers among the crowd to stop its further spread. Now, with the relaxation of lockdown, the chances of spread of infection are more. Other than the current testing procedure (RT-PCR), we need a more sophisticated strategy for diagnosis,” said Anant Bhan, global health expert.Experts say a large number of people could be asymptomatic or silent spreaders, as they carry Covid-19 pathogens without any symptoms. Even though the chance of the spread of infection through them is low, they are still infectious. On May 18, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) declared that asymptomatic high-risk contact of Covid patients can be tested without prescriptions. Despite this, there is no clarity among coordinators of the helpline of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and private laboratories. Also, high-risk contacts, too, struggle for tests. However, state health officers have claimed that adequate number of tests is being done based on the protocols laid down by the ICMR. “Random testing is not feasible because it increases the chance of false negatives, where a person shows a negative report but is infected. As we are doing high-risk-based testing, our results are better. In private labs, per 100, we are getting 19 positive patients. While in government labs, the infection rate is 19.5%,” said Dr Sanjay Mukherjee, director of Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD). “These guidelines are being made by experts who have years of experience. So, people need to trust them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/not-enough-covid-tests-in-maha-say-experts/story-RKg1Zy2mDB7x37SW0YuuoK.html
13-06-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra at 1 lakh cases, where does Mumbai stand?||Amid the grim Covid-19 milestones, Mumbai is showing some signs of improvement, with its share in Maharashtra’s cases dropping to 54.82% as of June 12, from the average of 64% in May. The city has seen a dip in cases in Dharavi, Worli, Wadala and Parel, which had emerged as Covid hotspots, according to the state’s and civic body’s data for their wards. Some areas such as Govandi, and Mankhurd, Bandra East, and slums of Kurla and Ghatkopar, too, are registering a drop in cases in June, compared to May. Experts, however, say it is too early to rejoice. Reasons? None of the 24 wards of Mumbai are showing signs of flattening the curve. Experts feel Mumbai is in the middle of its peak right now, with this being its “wait-and-watch period”. And, with the staggered easing of relaxations announced in the city since June 5, as part of Maharashtra’s Mission Begin Again plan, cases are likely to surge again.Moreover, the number of cases on any given day in June for Mumbai has not dropped below 1,000. On an average, any given day in June saw 1,300 covid-19 cases, compared to the average of 1,250 in the last 10 days of May.Municipal commissioner IS Chahal said, “Over 25,000 patients have recovered. The doubling rate is 25 days now. For better management of bed availability, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) now has a decentralised ward-level bed management system and a dashboard for beds in real-time. There is an Uber platform for booking ambulances. BMC will also add 650 more ambulances to its fleet next week. There have been no deaths due to lack of dialysis in the past one month. A figure of 52,000 cases is scary, until you look at these things.”According to a senior civic officer from BMC’s health department, a person infected by Covid-19 will begin to show symptoms or will test positive anywhere between the first or fifth day from being infected. Taking this into consideration, BMC has decided to closely observe the period of two weeks from the time Mumbai began to ease its restrictions. The city has seen more cases on June 11 and June 12, which mark over six days since Mission Begin Again. June 11 recorded 1,418 and June 12 saw 1,366 cases. As of Friday, 45.35% or 25,152 people of cases have recovered. It has 28,248 active cases at present, or 50.94% of the total cases recorded so far. Mumbai contributes to 54.82% of Maharashtra’s total cases. It contributes to 56.9% of Maharashtra’s active cases, and 54.99% of its total deaths.On May 1, Mumbai’s share in Maharashtra’s cases was 67.89% and in the state’s deaths was 60.82%. On May 15, this went down to 60.62% share in cases, but 61.32% in deaths. At the end of last month, on May 31, Mumbai contributed to 58.65% of Maharashtra’s total cases, 59.97% of its active cases, and 55.94% of the deaths.This drop is mainly attributed to a decrease in Mumbai’s growth rate to 2.76% as of Thursday. A week ago, on June 5, it was 3.09%. On May 31, Mumbai’s growth rate was 3.85%, and on May 27, it was 5.17%.The G-North ward, with jurisdiction over Dharavi slum and earlier identified as a Covid-19 hotspot, and the G-South ward, with jurisdiction over Worli Koliwada, the first containment zone of Mumbai, have shown improvement in their curve. Both these wards have more recoveries than active cases.The G-North ward with areas of Dharavi, Dadar, and Mahim has recorded a total of 3,668 cases so far. It has 1,251 active cases (34%) as of Thursday. Over 60% of its patients have recovered and have been discharged. Its growth rate is 1.5%.The G-South ward, covering areas of Worli, Lower Parel, Elphinstone, and Prabhadevi, with a total of 2,593 cases, has shown a recovery rate of 55%. A total of 38% of its cases are active. Its growth rate is 1.8%.The E ward, comprising Byculla, Nagpada, and Mumbai Central, which is among the five wards with most number of cases in Mumbai (3,085) has more patients who have recovered in comparison to its active cases. While 52% of patients in E ward have been discharged, 44% of its total cases are active. The ward has a mortality rate of 3.10%.The M-East ward, comprising slums of Govandi and Mankhurd, also has a high recovery rate in comparison to its active cases. It has a total of 2,444 cases, 52% of them have recovered. It has 44% active cases (1,082).However, wards where the curve is steeply rising even now are K-East, with a total of 3,616 cases, a growth rate of 4.1%, and 53% active cases. P-North of Malad has shown a steep upward curve with a total of 2,569 cases, a growth rate of 4.9%, and 69% of its cases still active.Prashant Sapkale, assistant commissioner of K-East ward, said, “There has been a rise in the number of cases in the past 15 days. It is a very big ward, in terms of population, floating population or bridge population of essential workers, and the area. It has Seven Hills Hospital, Marol Police Line, CISF camp, Trauma Hospital and airport.”Sanjog Kabare, assistant commissioner of the P-North ward was not available for comment. Madhav Sathe, retired professor of microbiology at Nair Hospital, said, “Cases are on a downward trend in certain areas, and hence it will impact Mumbai’s curve. While this is good news, the curve needs to further go downward.”According to Sathe, an important aspect for Mumbai to focus on is further reduction of its death rate. He said, “There are two or three treatment modalities which need to be activated soon, independent of government procedure of clearance. Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, and Tocilizumab , an immuno-modulant drug, can be proactively used. There is ICMR permission to use these drugs. However, the rule states the hospital committee has to approve its use in a medical college which can take seven-eight days. That is precious time lost.” Sathe said this drug has shown good results in many countries battling Covid-19, and permission to use these drugs need to be fast-tracked. “We will reduce the death rate to almost 1% with this, and plasma therapy.”Regarding lifting of lockdown, Sathe said, “I think we are in our peak of cases now. Cases are likely to increase due to staggered easing of relaxations, but that can be handled when mortality is reduced, and the phobia around the infection is reduced.”Sanjay Pattiwar, a city-based public health consultant, said, “Now that restrictions have eased, the scenario is going to change. Factors such as population density, use of public transport, compromised social distancing because of it are going to contribute to increase in cases. More contact tracing is required now. But the government may not have the resources required to trace so many contacts. It is not even possible considering Mumbai’s population.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-at-1-lakh-cases-where-does-mumbai-stand/story-5CCDWhBoknYQHRYuiTXZcP.html

13-06-2020||Chandigarh||Lockdown no deterrence, snatchers had free run in Ludhiana amid restrictions||While the city cops toiled to keep people indoors to curb the spread of Covid-19, snatchers seemed to have a free run in the city. While the overall crime rate in Ludhiana saw a considerable dip in the lockdown period, snatchings continued unabated.As per the data available with the Ludhiana police, as many as 45 snatchings were reported in the 79 days since the restrictions began on March 23.A closer look at the data reveals that the snatchers were the most active during the third phase of the lockdown (May 4 to May 17), when the government had allowed vehicular movement and opening of shops between 7am to 7pm. As many as 13 snatchings were reported in the city during this period.The second phase of the lockdown, when stricter curbs were in place and no vehicular movement was allowed, saw only five snatchings.Once the unlocking process began in June, there was a surge in snatchings, with 10 cases being reported in the first 10 days of the month.MOST SNATCHINGS TOOK PLACE ON INTERIOR ROADSPolice also found that most of the snatchings took place in the interior roads as people were not venturing out on the main roads due to the restrictions.VICTIMS RECOUNT HORRORSarwan Kumar, a gas agency employee, who fell prey to snatchers on April 6, says he never thought miscreants would be active during a curfew. “I was out delivering LPG gas cylinders on April 6 when I was waylaid by two motorycle-borne men near Mukund Singh Nagar. They flashed a gun at me and took my bag containing Rs 10,500. It all happened within a matter of few seconds. I never thought such an incident would take place when there was such a strong police presence throughout the city.” On his complaint, the Division Number 6 police registered a snatching case.Gurmeet Singh of Behlolpur village, a liquor vend employee, fell prey to snatchers on the night of May 30. As per the complaint, two men posing as customers came to the vend and asked him to serve them liquor. As the vend was closed, he refused to serve them. Following this, they flashed a gun at him and robbed him of Rs 9,000 after beating him up.TREADING THE RISKY PATHAll didn’t go as planned for some of the snatchers who found the tables turned on them. On April 15, a snatcher lost his life as his bike plunged into a drain when he was trying to flee after committing the crime. In another incident, a resident of Bajra village beat up a snatcher who was trying to snatch a mobile phone from a labourer on April 7. The miscreant had to be rushed to the hospital for treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lockdown-no-deterrence-snatchers-had-free-run-in-ludhiana-amid-restrictions/story-DhjFGjdFETLMdJ3xsvZTXP.html

13-06-2020||Chandigarh||Man running shell firms made ₹70 cr via forged GST bills, held||A team of the state goods and service tax (GST) department on Friday arrested a 52-year-old man along with his two accomplices in the industrial town of Mandi Gobindgarh for running a web of shell companies and making ₹70 crore by producing forged GST bills. The accused have been identified as kingpin Ganga Ram, a resident of the town, and Amit Kumar and Vishesh Kumar, both migrants. Officials claimed that Ganga Ram was operating almost three dozen shell companies to produce GST billings and took cut from input tax credit availed by other businessmen on basis of forged bills. “So far, we have detected fake billing of ₹350 crore which caused a loss of ₹45 crore in tax revenue to the state exchequer. In the last one year, Ganga Ram, who has been operating firms and bank accounts registered on the name of his relatives and some migrants, withdrew ₹70 crore from banks through bogus billing,” said additional excise and taxation commissioner Showkat Ahmad Parray, who is heading the special data cell to crack such cases. Ram was also paying some amount to those on whose name he had registered the firms and would get their signatures on cheque books to withdraw money. Several cheque books have also been recovered from him, officials said. “Amit and Vishesh, who had come to the town in search of labour work, joined Ram as he would use their documents to open shell companies. Also, he was planning to open a factory in Himachal Pradesh with the money earned from bogus billing. Besides, he built a house and purchased some property. Most of his cash withdrawal from banks are below ₹1 crore to avoid TDS (tax deducted on source) on withdrawal,” Parray said. On specific inputs, a team of officials from Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Fatehgarh Sahib launched a joint operation and raided the so-called factories and offices of firms involved in bogus billing, he added. “Several firms are engaged in issuing fake invoices and passing bogus input tax credit to others in Punjab without any supply of goods. We found that 10 firms issued fake invoices worth ₹350 crores involving tax of ₹45 crore,” said Parray.Ram got registered firms namely GK Enterprises, Deepika Steel Industries in his name; King Sales Corporation and Ishika Traders in the name of Amit Kumar; and Vishu Enterprises in the name of Vishesh Kumar among others, it has been found. Also, documents were seized from the residence of the accused.The other beneficiaries of the fake billing will be identified, Parray added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/man-running-shell-firms-made-70-cr-via-forged-gst-bills-held/story-VbRmCsNN6DUTXh9314jkRI.html

13-06-2020||Chandigarh||Fresh Covid guidelines in Punjab: Non-essential shops to stay shut on Sunday, close by 5pm on Sat||Only shops dealing with essential commodities and services will be allowed to open in Punjab on Sundays and holidays while those selling non-essential items will have to down their shutters at 5pm on Saturdays, say the state government’s new guidelines to deal with the rise in Covid-19 cases. But an exception has been made for liquor vends and restaurants (takeaway and home delivery) that may stay open till 8pm on all days. Also, inter-district movement in the state on weekends and holidays will be restricted barring e-pass holders. Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Friday approved the detailed weekend and holiday restriction guidelines. The CM on Thursday had cited fear of community spread of Covid-19 in Punjab in a preparedness review.The guidelines issued on Friday are in addition to those notified earlier by the state government for lockdown 5.0/unlock 1.0, and will remain in force on weekends and gazetted holidays till further orders.The new guidelines also state that the district magistrates in consultation with the market associations may choose to order closure of the non-essential shops on any other day of the week also, especially in the high-risk areas. Inter-district movement will be issued only for essential work but no pass shall be required for such travel in case of medical emergency. E-pass will also be required for a wedding function and will be issued only to 50 persons.The CM appealed to the people of Punjab to strictly adhere to the social-distancing norms and wear masks. The situation demanded stringent compliance with all the restrictions, he stressed, adding that though the situation in the state was relatively in control, the government was not ready to take any chances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fresh-covid-guidelines-in-punjab-non-essential-shops-to-stay-shut-on-sunday-close-by-5pm-on-sat/story-pdZwOlZ5HyqDRtpbjdtJjK.html
13-06-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 cases cross 100,000-mark; Mumbai’s toll goes past 2,000||Ninety-six days since the first Covid-19 case was reported in Maharashtra, the state crossed the 100,000-mark on Friday, with an addition of 3,493 cases. The state’s coronavirus count stands at 101,141 cases. Fatalities in Maharashtra also rose to 3,717 as 127 more deaths were reported. Mumbai, which is the worst-hit city in India, recorded 1,366 new cases, taking its tally to 55,451, while 90 deaths took the city’s toll past the 2,000-mark to 2,044. With the state reporting more than 3,000 cases daily for the past three days, the state government and health experts remained unsure about projections and trajectory of the virus curve. While the rise of infections in Mumbai has been arrested over the past couple of weeks, with hotspots such as Dharavi and Worli Koliwada leading the way, cases across the state have seen a spike. Over the past week, the state has recorded 20,912 cases and 868 deaths – a daily average of 2,987 cases and 124 deaths till Friday.Health officials said Mumbai’s case curve may flatten first, going by the current trend. The city’s daily rise in cases has dropped in comparison to the overall state figures over the past three weeks. Mumbai accounted for 63.73% of the state’s new cases on May 14, 56.47% on May 28, 49.06% on June 4 and 39.10% on Friday.“This clearly indicates that the cases in other parts of the state are on the rise because the number of cases in Mumbai has dropped in the proportion of its percentage with the state level cases,” said a health department official, on condition of anonymity. “The plateau in Mumbai cases is a positive sign. We are more worried about the poor health infrastructure in some of the other districts such as Amravati.”Dr Om Shrivastava, infectious diseases specialist and a member of the taskforce appointed by the state government for the clinical management of critically-ill patients, said the curve in Mumbai will stabilise soon. “The number of cases in Mumbai has come down significantly in the past four weeks. We may expect flattening of the curve soon. But at the same time, in the rest of Maharashtra, the number of cases may rise. In June and July, the number of cases may keep rising and we need to be more cautious and observant. Once we get through these months, we will be in a position to see which direction we are moving,” he said. Dr Avinash Supe, former KEM dean and member of the expert committee appointed by the state to recommend steps to curb the spread of the virus, said rise in the cases should not be a cause of worry to some extent. “There are different trends and phenomena in different areas in the state. While there is a plateau in some parts of the state, a few areas are emerging as hotspots. As long as we are ready with the infrastructure to handle the cases and treat the patients, as per their conditions, this should not be a cause of concern. It is difficult to predict when we can see a downward trend, but the next two weeks are important and by end of June, we will have a clearer picture,” he said.A senior health department official admitted that the state had been hoping to flatten the curve by May-end. “We had been expecting the flattening of the curve by May-end and the chief minister had directed the authorities to set targets accordingly. In the current scenario, it seems to be difficult even by June-end. However, we have been successful in keeping our count much below projections by various agencies, including the Central government, for Mumbai and Maharasthra,” said the official, who did not want to be named. Given the unpredictability of the disease, the government is unlikely to offer any relaxations now and will observe how the existing relaxations have impacted the state’s case tally. “Many commercial and industrial activities have been allowed, except in Red Zones. Opening of shops, private offices and allowing outdoor physical activities from June 3 to 8 may lead to surge in cases in the next few days. We are very closely observing the trend and no more relaxations will be given at this stage,” said a senior bureaucrat, who is part of the core group that finalised the strategy on handling the Covid-19 pandemic in Maharashtra. Officials from the state government, districts collectors and municipal corporations have been directed to concentrate on “chasing the virus” and at the same time “containing it”. “It is a two-fold strategy. We have directed local authorities to ramp up infrastructure while tracing the high- and low-risk contacts within 24 hours after patients test positive. At the same time, they have been told to strictly implement the lockdown in containment zones. In rural and semi-urban areas, the spread is rapid through the people travelling from big cities like Mumbai and Pune. We have asked local authorities to monitor these travellers strictly,” the bureaucrat said.The health department official pointed out that the rate of the doubling of cases had improved to more than 16 days, and even the case fatality rate (CFR) is in control (3.7% as of Friday). He said although the Centre has raised a red flag over high CFR in Mumbai, Thane, it is much lower than what it was three weeks ago. Scientists believe the lockdown helped reduce the infection rate, or R0 (referring to the number of people infected by one Covid-positive individual).Professor Bhalchandra Pujari of Savitribai Phule Pune University said R0 in most states, including Maharashtra, is estimated to be between 1 and 2 as INDSCI-SIM, the first India specific epidemiological developed by the Indian Scientists’ Response to Covid-19 (ISRC). ISRC is a voluntary group of more than 500 Indian scientists, engineers, doctors, technologists and public health researchers.“Before the lockdown, RO was estimated to be between 2.5 to 3, which has significantly reduced to 2 owing to the lockdown,” said Pujari, who was member of the team that developed INDISCI-SIM. “The main purpose of the lockdown was to push the peak, flatten the curve and give space to prepare health infrastructure. Our earlier report, stating that peak infections will occur in June-July, still stands.”According to Dr Pradip Awate, state’s surveillance officer, the health department has witnessed possible chances of community transmission in some parts of the state and this could be the reason for the continued increase in cases. “We are seeing signs of community transmission not only in Mumbai, but also across Maharashtra. We are getting cases in clusters without the source of infection. The lockdown, to a great extent, has helped to control the spread of infection,” said Dr Awate. While the number of positive cases in Mumbai is on decline, the state authorities are worried about the lapses in health services emerging over the past few days. The shortage of beds for Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients and reports of hardship faced by citizens is worrying.“It is true that the reports about bodies and patients going missing and deaths reported due to non-availability of beds are not a good sign for the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government,” said a senior state minister, who did not want to be named. “The Opposition has been cornering us, pointing at these lapses. The acquisition of the beds from private hospitals has not been done as per expectations and there are complaints of a few hospitals playing spoilsport. Health minister Rajesh Tope has asked municipal commissioner of Mumbai to ensure that 80% beds in private hospitals are acquired at the earliest.”State health minister Rajesh Tope said strict action has been taken against the officials responsible for the negligence over treatment to patients. He said the cases of negligence at Shatabdi Hospital or the one in Jalgaon have been “taken up seriously”.With inputs by Snehal Fernandes and Rupsa Chakraborty||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-cases-cross-100-000-mark-mumbai-s-toll-goes-past-2-000/story-lH7uixXgI0rtufU7DR5b7M.html

13-06-2020||Mumbai||BMC to take over 5 ESIC hospitals to add 1,000 Covid beds||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is set to take over Central government-run Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) hospitals in the city for Covid-19 treatment. The civic body plans to add another 1,000 Covid beds in the five ESIC hospitals, of which almost 30% will be reserved for intensive care unit (ICU). With the rising number of cases every day, civic-run hospitals are overwhelmed and most private hospitals are also running out of beds for critically-ill patients. According to BMC data, almost 97% ICU and ventilator beds are occupied by patients with severe breathing difficulties. In an attempt to increase the bed strength, BMC is now going to convert the five ESIC hospitals in Worli, Parel, Kandivli, Andheri and Mulund into full-fledged Covid-19 hospitals. “With the addition of these five hospitals, we will add another 1,000 beds. 70% of the beds will be reserved for isolation and 30% for ICU. We have already started treating patients in the Mahatma Gandhi Hospital in Parel,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.At present, the city has five dedicated Covid-19 hospitals — BYL Nair, SevenHills, Kasturba Gandhi, St George and GT hospitals. Of these, barring SevenHills Hospital which is in Marol, all other Covid-19 hospitals are in south Mumbai. So, opening up Covid hospitals in suburbs in Kandivli and Mulund will be helpful to patients.“At the Kandivli hospital, we will start a 300-bed facility for Covid patients,” Kakani said. The Central government had invested ₹180 crore the construction of the hospital which was inaugurated in 2015 but started functioning only in 2019. However, the ESIC hospital at Marol in Andheri (East) has been lying dysfunctional after a fire outbreak in 2018 that killed 11 people including patients. ESIC hospitals come under the Union ministry of labour and employment. Central government employees can avail free treatment at these hospitals all across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-take-over-5-esic-hospitals-to-add-1-000-covid-beds/story-AcdMddwsDV3WcKGapvFCvI.html
13-06-2020||Chandigarh||Four ‘courier boys’ rob ₹7L from Ludhiana steel firm owner’s office||Four miscreants, posing as courier delivery boys, robbed ₹7 lakh from the office of a steel factory owner after holding his employees hostage at gunpoint on Friday evening. Minutes before the incident, an employee of the factory owner’s business associate had visited the office to make a payment of ₹5.2 lakh.The entire incident was caught on closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras installed in the area.As per information, two employees of Happy Gupta, the owner of AH Alloys, were present in the office located in Industrial Area-B, when a person claiming to be a courier delivery boy knocked on the door.₹ When they opened the door, three other miscreants barged in and asked them to hand over all the cash they had in office.One of the employees, identified as Tejwant Singh, said the miscreants were armed with a gun and some sharp-edged weapons. The men took away ₹7 lakh, which included ₹5.28 lakh that had been brought in by their business associate and ₹1.7 lakh that was already lying in office.

13-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi L-G Anil Baijal appoints panel to aid Delhi’s Covid-19 pandemic response||Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal on Friday appointed a six-member advisory committee to suggest effective measures to the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak in the city and to guide the augmentation of hospital beds.The decision by the L-G, who also heads the DDMA, came a day after Delhi recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases in a single day (1,877), which took the total number of Covid-19 cases to nearly 35,000. On the same day, the death toll in the city crossed the 1,000-mark.Members of the advisory committee set up by the L-G on Friday include Krishna Vatsa, member, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA); Kamal Kishore, another member of the NDMA; Professor Balram Bhargava, director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR); Dr Randeep Guleria, director of the All India Institute of Medical Science; Dr Ravindran, Additional DDG at the Directorate General of Health Services and Dr Surjit Kumar Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control. Bhargava shall be heading the committee, said a senior officer in the L-G’s office.A statement issued by the office of the L-G on Friday said: “The Lieutenant Governor of Delhi today constituted an advisory committee of eminent experts under section 17 of DDMA Act to advise the DDMA on various aspects of COVID-19 management. The committee comprises eminent experts of varied fields.”“The expert committee will give their opinion on various challenges being faced in Delhi in the prevention of the spread of COVID-19 and measures to ramp up medical infrastructure. The committee would also provide examples from global and national best practices. The L-G stated that the efforts being made by DDMA need to be bolstered by concerted planning, use of latest technology, efficient monitoring and seamless coordination amongst various agencies to overcome the challenge.” Dr Guleria confirmed that he has been made a part of the committee. The Delhi government too had earlier appointed two five-member advisory committees. Both have submitted several reports to the Delhi government and they are both officially functional till date, a senior government official said.The first committee — led by Dr SK Sarin — was formed on March 27 to suggest measures to the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak in the city. The second one — led by Dr Mahesh Verma — was formed on June 2 to help the government augment the city’s health care infrastructure.Earlier this week, the L-G scrapped two Delhi government orders — one reserving beds in hospitals run by the city government and private ones, except a few, for residents of Delhi, and the other on keeping asymptomatic contacts of Covid-19 patients outside the ambit of the testing policy. On Wednesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said Covid-19 cases in Delhi would touch 550,000 by July 31 and the city would need at least 150,000 beds if patients from other states are allowed treatment in the Capital’s hospitals.AUGMENTATION & CONTAINMENTEarlier on Friday, in a review meeting with Kejriwal, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, and senior bureaucrats leading the DDMA, Baijal stressed on stricter surveillance of the 212 active containment zones in the city even as he told the Delhi government that augmentation of the city’s hospital bed capacity should be its “top-most priority” at this stage, in the light of the sharp spike in Covid-19 cases.Most of Delhi’s containment zones are in the north revenue district (35). The northeast district, despite being the one with highest population density, has emerged as the only district currently with no active containment zones, government records showed. Four weeks ago, the city had less than 100 such zones.While north district magistrate Deepak Shinde did not respond to phones and text messages, northeast district magistrate Shashi Kaushal said there are currently no virus clusters in the revenue district, and most cases there are isolated instances, which did not necessitate sealing areas. But he added that the district administration will not hesitate to seal areas if clusters are noticed at any point.Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital said, “At this juncture, it is very important for the government to ensure that district surveillance teams stay active in containment zones and adequate staff from district medical teams are always available to guide them. They can consider using trained volunteers from within communities to monitor the efficiency of the surveillance and testing mechanism. Rapid action teams should continue to be active in data collection, contact tracing and surveillance, their analysis and interpretation, and guide the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-l-g-baijal-appoints-panel-to-aid-delhi-s-pandemic-response/story-1NAFo7XKS3DQwkOoEhgH1J.html

13-06-2020||City||Feroze Gandhi Colony murder: Weapon supplier arrested||Gurugram  Two weeks after a 38-year-old city-based property dealer, suspected to be a close associate of gangster Binder Gujjar, was shot dead in Feroze Gandhi colony, the police have arrested a 30-year-old man for allegedly supplying weapons used in the shooting.The police said the suspect, identified as Naveen Singh, who is from Rohtak, had supplied two pistols used in the murder of Vikas Dureja. Singh, who has 11 criminal cases including murders, extortion, assault, and illegal arms smuggling registered against him, was arrested by a team of crime branch, Sector 10. One pistol, which he had purchased from Delhi for ₹45,000, and three live cartridges were recovered from his possession, the police said. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said, “Preliminary probe has revealed that the arrested suspect was not involved in the planning of the murder and his role was mainly to supply the weapons. The other suspects are yet to be identified”According to the preliminary probe by the police, a week before Dureja’s murder, Singh had provided two pistols to one Vikas. The police are now trying to trace Singh’s associates in Delhi and NCR. On May 29 around 2.45 pm, Vikas Dureja alias Vicky was on his way to his office when unidentified suspects had rained bullets at him after blocking his way in Feroze Gandhi colony. The victim had tried to reverse his car when an SUV, in which at least three suspects were seated, had rammed his car from behind. The suspects had fired gunshots at close range at his car and he had succumbed to injuries from multiple gunshots wounds on the spot.The autopsy had revealed that Dureja had received 30 gunshot wounds, the police said. Dureja had allegedly been involved in some of Gujjar’s business dealings since Gujjar was arrested last year by the Mumbai crime branch for an alleged conspiracy to kill his rival Sandeep Gadoli. The police said they are also probing if Sandeep Gadoli’s henchmen had planned Dureja’s murder as an act of possible revenge for Gadoli’s killing. The rivalry between Gujjar and Gadoli had resulted in a turf war lasting several years, resulting in several inter-gang killings.“We are yet to come across evidence about the victim’s involvement in criminal activities. We are looking at all angles including gang rivalry, “ said the ACP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/feroze-gandhi-colony-murder-weapon-supplier-arrested/story-Kp9G5kPZfv1qYlHmhUEERK.html

13-06-2020||City||District admin makes it mandatory for labs to use RT-PCR mobile app||Gurugram: The district administration on Friday made it mandatory for sample collectors and testing labs to use the RT-PCR mobile application approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to streamline data collection and ensure that the information pertaining to the sampling of Covid-19 patients is collected on a real-time basis.The decision comes after health authorities and the district administration found that testing centres and labs were not able to collate information accurately, leading to discrepancies in ascertaing the exact number of Covid-19 infections.Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram issued a direction, stating that it would be mandatory for all registered sample collection centres and testing labs to use the RT-PCR application on an immediate basis. “This application is meant to be used by sample collectors to enter the details of the sample being collected for Covid-19 RT-PCR test.” The RT-PCR or the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction test is used in detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes coronavirus disease or Covid-19.The district administration has also directed that all sample collectors will have to fill in the information about the patients on the application, which will help in centralised information collection. In another related decision, the testing labs have also been asked to obtain permanent address proof from suspected patients and check the mobile numbers before the collection of samples.This comes after a number of Covid-19 patients shared wrong addresses with authorities, which made it quite difficult for patients to be traced, said officials.The labs will also have to save a copy of the permanent address proof of the patients at the time of sample collection..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/district-admin-makes-it-mandatory-for-labs-to-use-rt-pcr-mobile-app/story-HU1oMfjcJf9oiV2S8NfQbP.html
13-06-2020||Gurugram||Private hospitals to reserve 25% of bed capacity for Covid-19 cases||The district administration, on Friday, directed the city’s private hospitals with a capacity of 50 beds or more to reserve 25% of their total bed strength for patients suffering from coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, issued an order on Friday evening, stating that 36 private hospitals in the city, including two government hospitals, namely ESIC Hospital in Sector 9 and the Sector 31 polyclinic, will have to earmark beds for Covid-19 patients as the number of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus is likely to breach the 3,000-mark by Saturday.Gurugram has only two state-run hospitals, the 58-bed ESIC Hospital in Sector 9 and the 12-bed Sector 31 polyclinic, to handle Covid-19 patients. A private facility, the 120-bed Medeor Hospital, has been designated as a Covid-19 hospital for treating critical cases. In the absence of adequate public health infrastructure, Covid-19 positive patients in Gurugram are undergoing treatment in private hospitals or are being home isolated.As per the order, the listed private hospitals that are require to reserve beds for Covid-19 patients include Alfaa, Artemis, Bhanot, Chirag, Columbia Asia, ESIC (Sector 9), Fortis, Geetanjali (Pataudi), K K Healthcare, Max, Mayom, Medanta, Medeor, Metro hospital and heart institute, Narayana, Paras, Park, Polyclinic (sector 31), SGT (Chandu Budhera), Signature, W Pratiksha, Neelkanth, Aryan, Uma Sanjeevani Health Centre, Kalyani, Cloudnine, Kathuria, Kids clinic India Pvt Ltd, VK Healthcare and Medical Institute private limited, Polaris, Save Life, Northeast Healthcare Private Limited, The Asia Clinics and Surgery, Kamla, Shri Gobind and Pushpanjali.Hospitals have also been ordered to ensure adequate availability of human resources and logistics, such as presence of drugs and critical care equipment. The decision has been taken in compliance with the directives issued by the state health department to ensure treatment facility at public and private hospitals for Covid-19 cases.Earlier this month, when the cases were below the 700-mark, Khatri issued an order, making it mandatory for all the private and nursing homes in the city to admit Covid-19 patients, without giving an exact number of beds to be earmarked in hospitals.Vivek Kalia, nodal officer for health facilities, said, “Facilities for Covid-19 patients have to be augmented as cases are climbing up. Out of the 822 Covid-19 beds in 38 hospitals, 465 beds are occupied by confirmed cases and 64 by suspected cases. At least 97 patients are in ICU while 31 patients, who are critical, are put on ventilator.”Data further shows that Gurugram has overall 4,114 general beds, out of which 822 are Covid-19 dedicated. Likewise, there are 630 ICU beds, of which 162 are earmarked for coronavirus positive patients. There are atleast 330 ventilators and 141 dialysis machines across 36 hospitals.The order states that all 36 hospitals will have to upload the details on an online portal called oneMap, wherein information regarding patients and the availability of beds will be daily updated. The data collation would help in establishing systemic surveillance at the district level, according to the order.The administration has also earlier issued the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the hospitals. The rules laid down in the draft SOP as reported by HT on Friday states that a hospital can refer a Covid-19 patient elsewhere only if it lacks enough beds.The SOPs also allows private hospitals to transfer patients with mild or moderate symptoms to Covid care centres, which include self-paid and government-paid isolation facilities. The guidelines state that patients who do not require to be admitted in hospital because of their mild and moderate symptoms, but can’t be home-isolated either due to lack of space, will have to be transferred by the hospital to isolation centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/private-hospitals-to-reserve-25-of-bed-capacity-for-covid-19-cases/story-pXyEBplVsenTTapxwWdWOO.html
13-06-2020||Gurugram||Delhi-NCR witnessed the lowest increase in property prices in last decade: Report||The National Capital Region (NCR), including Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Greater Noida, Faridabad and adjoining areas, witnessed the lowest decadal increase in the price of residential housing at only 19% even though the average increase in property prices in the top seven real estate markets across the country was around 38%, found a report released by real estate consultancy Anarock.The report also stated that the price growth has gradually stagnated across the country, although Pune witnessed the highest price growth of 67% in the last decade.Real estate experts in Gurugram also said that barring steep spikes in price of properties between the years 2012 and 2014, the city did not witness any sharp rise in prices of residential housing as demand was low and the delay in project delivery also dampened the confidence of home buyers. Also the tendency of speculative buying and selling of houses as a commodity have also stopped due to exit of investors from the trade, thereby stabilizing the prices, they added.Prashant Thakur, director and head of research, Anarock property consultants, said, “While question of affordability still looms large in the minds of the Indian homebuyers, property price growth has gradually stagnated. The value of property, defined by size and location, is now distinctly higher.”As per the data shared by the firm, NCR saw the least increase in property prices and it stood at 19% between 2010-Q1 2020 period. The average price recorded in the region in 2010 was Rs 3,850 per square foot (sq ft)while in Q1 2020, it had increased to Rs 4,580 per sq. ft.The report further stated that in the initial 5-year period between 2010 to 2014, average property prices increased by anywhere between 5 and 7% year on year. Thereafter, growth began to slow down significantly, ranging between 0 and 2%, it added.The report further stated that average price in Pune rose by 67% in the decade, while in Bangalore it saw a 49% rise. Hyderbad witnessed a 45% increase in property prices while Kolkata saw a 44% rise in the prices of properties. The Mumbai metropolitan region saw a 33% increase in the prices of property while Chennai witnessed only 20% hike in the 2010 to 2020 period.Sanjay Sharma, a city-based real consultant, said that Delhi-NCR, including Gurugram, has been under a prolonged slowdown. Further, there is an oversupply in the real estate market in the region, which is leading to a lack in consumer demand and a stagnation in prices. “The pandemic will further complicate the matters,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/delhi-ncr-witnessed-the-lowest-increase-in-property-prices-in-last-decade-finds-report/story-3Sk8nB0dCo49uvV2jujOeO.html
13-06-2020||City||Gurugram to have five CNG-equipped crematoriums by July||Gurugram Following directions by the chief minister of Haryana, Manohar Lal Khattar, and citing an increase in deaths caused by Covid-19, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is making four crematoriums CNG-equipped while also renovating a defunct crematorium, said MCG officials on Friday.There have been 19 deaths due to Covid-19 in the city, of which 15 have been recorded since June 8.MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, in an internal office order on Wednesday stated, “due to an increase in Covid deaths” the MCG is making four crematoriums, located at Sukhrali Village near Atul Kataria Chowk, Tigra Village, Palam Vihar and Sector 32, CNG-equipped.In addition, MCG is also working on renovating the defunct CNG crematorium at DLF Phase-3, established in 2012. The work on the crematorium has also started and is expected to be completed within two weeks.On May 2, during a meeting with all seven mayors of Haryana via videoconference, Khattar had directed MCG to explore the possibility of equipping all existing crematoriums to operate with either CNG or LPG.During the meeting, Khattar said that in a CNG- or an LPG-equipped crematorium, there are lower chances of human contact with a Covid-19 body as against the conventional method of burning a body over a pyre, thereby minimising the chances of people contracting the infection.Singh said that all five crematoriums will be operational by July 15, at a total cost of around Rs 3 crore.“We want to limit the spread of Covid-19 and any measure that can help achieve this is being implemented immediately. Orders have been issued to make the five crematoriums CNG-ready by next month. Work has already started at the DLF Phase-3 facility. Work at the other four will also start soon,” said Singh.Besides these five, the MCG has another crematorium at Madan Puri, which is already LPG-equipped.MCG officials said that to further limit the spread of Covid-19, the civic body is also exploring the possibility of reserving two of the six sites, for cremating Covid-19 fatalities exclusively. However, a final decision is yet to be taken on it.“The idea behind keeping exclusive crematoriums for Covid-19 fatalities is to ensure that the virus does not spread. There is a possibility that the crowd at the site for a Covid-19 fatality may come in contact with the infected body. We do not want to mix Covid and non-Covid fatalities,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.The official further said that by separating crematoriums for Covid-19 fatalities, and non-Covid 19 fatalities greater focus can be given on the former in regards to disinfection, sanitization, and social distancing protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-to-have-five-cng-equipped-crematoriums-by-july/story-BJ3LuypRp5uhz6qgQ7uHUL.html
13-06-2020||Delhi||Two more Delhi teachers succumb to Covid-19, others demand protective gear||A 57-year-old principal of a Delhi government school and a 48-year-old English teacher have succumbed to Covid-19 in less than a week, leading to growing anxiety and demands for protective gear — Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kits, masks and gloves — among government and municipal teachers, who are the frontline of the city’s battle against Covid-19.Earlier, in May this year municipality teacher and a security guard working at a ration distribution centre had succumbed to the virus. So far, Delhi has witnessed 36,824 cases of the virus with 1,214 deaths.On Thursday, Ompal Singh, principal of a government in Kalyanpuri, died after getting infected with Covid-19. Shyam Lal, vice-principal of the school, said that Singh was supervising the cooked food distribution at his school since April. “He was admitted to GTB hospital on June 5, after he was finding it difficult to breathe. He succumbed to the virus on Thursday. His family members, including his 12-day-old grandson, have also tested positive now. There is a lot of panic among teachers working at the food distribution centres in our school,” he said.On June 8, an English teacher, Shivaji Mishra, who was employed at a government school in Kalyan Niwas had died of Covid-19. Mishra, 48, was also working at a food distribution centre. His son Piyush Mishra said that his father developed symptoms of Covid-19 around June 1. “On June 2 his condition worsened and we took him to a private hospital in Mandoli. He tested positive for Covid last Thursday, following which the hospital asked us to shift him to a Covid designated hospital. We shifted him to Safdurjaung hospital on Friday, where he was shifted to ICU. He succumbed on Sunday,” he said.Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the government school teachers association, said that more than 400 government school teachers on Covid duty have tested positive for the deadly virus in the last two months. “The government needs to help their families and provide them with jobs since they got infected while on duty. We also demand safety gear for the teachers working at the food and ration distribution centres,” he said.Delhi Education minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio, on Friday said that the government was working to release ex-gratia for the families of Singh and Mishra. “My salute to the teachers of Delhi who are writing history through their selfless service in our fight against Covid-19. My heart goes out to the grieving families of Ompal Singh & Shivji Mishra who lost their lives. Delhi Govt. is working to release ex-gratia immediately,” he said in a tweet.A senior official at the Directorate of Education (DoE) said the government is providing masks and PPEs wherever required. “We are still collecting details of teachers who have tested positive and were on Covid relief work. We will also send a proposal to the finance department seeking monetary relief for the families of teachers who have succumbed to the virus,” said the official.The municipal corporation teachers association said that as many as 150 of their teachers have tested positive for Covid-19 till date. Ramnivas Solanki, president of the association, said, “The Delhi government has already announced relief of Rs 1 crore to MCD teachers who die of Covid-19. But there should be safety gear for all the teachers working at ration distribution centres so that we don’t have any other casualties,” he said.Officials at the civic bodies said that their teachers are engaged in Delhi government’s relief work and they should be provided the title of “Covid warriors”. Avatar Singh, mayor of the north civic body, said, “The government should also provide health insurance to these teachers so that they do not feel insecure while working at relief centres.”A senior government official said “Every possible help is provided to the teachers on Covid duty. All government officials are working selflessly amid the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-more-delhi-teachers-succumb-to-virus-others-demand-protective-gear/story-ZBXg0LS4XyUniPISGntkOO.html
13-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi markets, residents at odds over govt’s decision to not extend lockdown||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain’s announcement of not extending the lockdown left resident welfare associations (RWAs) disappointed on Friday, even as traders remained divided over the issue with some even conducting surveys to decide if markets should stay shut. With Covid-19 cases rising, speculation was rife that the government could impose the lockdown again in some form. Talking to reporters on Friday, Jain, however, said, “No, the lockdown will not be extended any further in Delhi.”Jain’s statement came at a time when some markets, especially the wholesale ones, are contemplating shutting down for the time being. The demand grew louder ever since the Delhi government on Tuesday said the Capital had hit the community transmission stage. The ICMR and the Centre, however, have denied it as of now. In June so far, the number of daily positive cases have oscillated between 990 and 1877.The Delhi government had on June 7 allowed malls, restaurants and places of religious worship to resume business after almost two-and-a-half-months. Shops were allowed for the entire day from June 1.The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) on Friday said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s statement about Delhi having around 5.5 lakh cases by July 31 had caused concern. CAIT began an online survey on Friday to take the opinion of various traders’ associations whether to keep markets in Delhi open or not.Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of CAIT, said, “Today, shops are open in Delhi but business is just 5-10%. In wholesale markets, customers from outside Delhi are not coming. In retail markets, local customers are not coming at all. This is due to the fear of the rising number of Covid-19 cases. We have sought people’s opinion and based on the outcome will take up the matter with the home minister and Delhi lieutenant-governor.”RWAs said they were “shocked” by the announcement. “It was for this the chief minister actually should have sought suggestions or a referendum. All RWAs want some form of restrictions back in the city because it is important to break the chain. Each market can be asked to open on one day of the week,” said Atul Goyal, president, URJA (United Residents Joint Action), an umbrella body of 2,500 RWAs.B S Vohra, president of East Delhi RWA front, another umbrella body with around 100 associate RWAs, said no action is being taken against those not wearing masks or not maintaining social distancing.“When you do not have enough manpower or resources to penalise those not following the civic norms of self protection and hygiene, which currently attracts heavy fines under the Disaster management Act, then you need a lockdown. Policemen or municipal corporations are not issuing any challans against those not wearing masks or those spitting in public places. There is no presence of any enforcement agencies,” said Vohra. Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable disease at ICMR, however, said the situation in Delhi is no longer about lockdown or no lockdown. “You see people still moving in groups without masks. It is more about the behaviour. At this stage the government and all other authorities should simply go all out to ensure four things -- masks are worn by all, there is no public spitting, people wash hands or sanitise and maintain social distance,” said Kant. Kant that not imposing a lockdown again is mostly because of the revenue losses. In April, the Delhi government had a total revenue of about Rs 400 crore only against the projected earnings of Rs 4,000 crore. In May, it was around Rs 600 crore or so. Majority of popular retail markets in Delhi such as Khan Market, Connaught Place, Sarojini Nagar, Lajpat Nagar, Karol Bagh have decided to remain open. Wholesale markets such as Chandni Chowk, Khari Baoli, Dariba were partially open on Friday.Atul Bhargava, president of New Delhi Traders Association, said, “We don’t want to close the market as business is gradually picking up. But, there is a need for improving sanitation and address the issue of street vendors. If vendors are allowed, social distancing will be next to impossible. They should be given space outside.”In the wholesale markets, which are mostly located in densely populated Old Delhi areas, traders devised their own mechanisms to regulate the number of people.While the Chandni Chowk Savy Vyapar Mandal has left the decision on individual traders, an association in Chawri Bazaar, which deals in files, has decided to open thrice a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-markets-residents-divided-about-govt-no-to-lockdown-extension/story-fSY77npyoRfB84R4gBO9EN.html

The patient reportedly had type-2 diabetes and bronchopneumonia. District health officials, however, claimed that the cause of death of that patient was acute respiratory distress syndrome with type-1 respiratory failure.With his death, the total death toll due to Covid-related causes in the Noida district is now 12, health officials said.On the other hand, the highest surge in Covid-19 cases was seen Friday when the district recorded 95 more positive cases, taking the overall tally of Covid-19 cases 830. District chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that till Friday evening, 477 patients have been discharged from different hospitals. “Apart from them, 69 others have been cross-notified to other districts and states. As a result, the district now has 341 active cases,” he said.The CMO further said that out of 95 positive cases on Friday, 59 were tested by private laboratories, while the remaining 36 were tested positive at government laboratories. “Of these 95 positives, while the total ILI patients are 77, the number of SARI patients is one. While the number of contact patients in these figures is 13, four healthcare workers have also got infected,” he said.He further said that adequate arrangements have been made in the district for sample collection of Covid-19 suspected patients. “Our team of doctors are always ready to take calls from the patients. At present, the district has eight sample collection centres, including a district hospital in Sector 30, a new hospital building in Sector 39 and the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, besides primary healthcare centres in Bisrakh, Dhankaur and Jewar, and community healthcare centres in Bhangel and Dadri,” he said. Giving details of 69 cross-notified Covid-19 positive cases, the CMO said that while 20 of them are from Delhi, one patient each is from Haryana, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. “While 10 patients have duplicate entries in the log, the remaining 36 are from other districts of Uttar Pradesh, including 11 from Ghaziabad, eight from Bulandshahr, two each from Hapur and Aligarh and one from Agra,” he said.Ohri also said that health camps were organised in 12 sensitive places in the district on Friday, including at Mamura, Nithari, Sarfabad, Harola, and sectors 8, 9 and 10. “A total of 671 patients were screened Friday and 17 of them, who had symptoms of fever, have been referred to the district hospital,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/covid-19-noida-records-95-new-cases-and-one-more-death-case-tally-now-830/story-154OwHe8oNFoxexWXrt4lL.html
13-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC refuses to pass orders on plea seeking action against private Covid-19 hospitals||The Delhi High Court on Friday refused to pass any directions on a plea that sought it to order the Delhi government to ensure that private hospitals declared Covid-19 facilities do not overcharge patients, or deny treatment due to a lack of funds.While the bench, of chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan, said the issue raised in the plea is “good”, it said it could not pass any general directions in the matter, saying these would be “difficult to implement”.“At this stage, we are not inclined to issue any direction,” the bench said while disposing the public interest litigation, filed by advocate Amit Sahni, who sought modifications in a May 24 Delhi government circular.The bench said in cases of overcharging, an aggrieved party may approach the court with a specific prayer against the respective hospital, but general directions cannot be passed in a PIL. It asked Sahni to give a representation to the Delhi government on the matter.According to the May 24 circular, private hospitals shall bill the Covid-19 patients as per their respective schedule of charges.By the virtue of the order, the hospitals were allowed to increase their number of beds for non-Covid patients by 25%, which was earlier not allowed as per norms.

The recommendation is a part of the standard operating procedure (SOP) that the education department has submitted for the new academic year of 2020-21, regulating durations of online classes and will be effective from June 15. The SOP is awaiting the chief minister’s approval.As per the SOP, a specific number of hours have been set for each standard and schools must conduct online classes only for that duration. For students of Class 3 to Class 5, classes can only be held for an hour a day. For Class 6 to Class 8, classes may be held for two hours and for Class 9 to Class 12, classes may be conducted for a maximum of three hours a day. Schools must also ensure students get breaks between classes.“These recommendations have been made after consulting experts and stakeholders including school heads, academicians, social workers etc. Our idea is to bring in some uniformity in the way online education is conducted. We had got several complaints from parents regarding online education,” said state education minister Varsha Gaikwad.In addition, the department has also proposed phased opening of schools in areas where there have not been any reported cases of Covid-19, starting July. Schools can first start Classes 9, 10 and 12 in July; followed by Class 6 to Class 8 from August; and Class 1 to Class 5 from September. The final decision about restarting schools in such areas would rest with the local administration as per the SOP. Until schools are asked to reopen, they should only conduct online classes.Parents said that if implemented, the SOP would be a big relief to children and parents.“Schools have started conducting classes in replication with actual periods in schools without considering the fact that so much screen time is not good for young children,” said Arpita Shinde, a city-based parent.On June 10, Shiv Sena’s student wing Yuva Sena had written to the department urging for a common set of guidelines after several parents complained that schools were conducting several hours of online classes even for lower classes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-classes-for-students-till-class-2-suggests-education-department/story-WHLb7eyn7qpd5q1R9oS61H.html
13-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police ASI dies of Covid-19, death toll in the force now five||A 53-year-old Delhi Police assistant sub-inspector (ASI), who was part of a special investigation team (SIT) probing the north-east Delhi riots cases, died of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Friday morning, taking the total count of deaths among city police force due to the virus to five. His 21-year-old son has also tested positive for the virus and is presently in home quarantine, a senior crime branch officer, privy to the development, said. ASI Sanjeev Kumar, was posted in the crime branch’s Rohini office. He died around 5.30pm at the Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) Hospital, where he was admitted on June 10, two days after his test report confirmed the virus infection, the officer cited above said.Special commissioner of police (crime) Praveer Ranjan confirmed that ASI Sanjeev Kumar was not part of the crime branch team probing the case related to the religious congregation organised by the Tablighi Jamaat at its headquarters in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area in mid-March.“The ASI was not involved in the Tablighi Jamaat case,” Ranjan said.Soon after the ASI’s death, unconfirmed reports started doing the rounds that he was connected to the case in which Tablighi Jamaat’s chief Maulana Saad and six other office bearers were booked for defying a series of government directives, which curbed religious and large gatherings, issued to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the national capital.Charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and criminal conspiracy were added to the case after some of the attendees of the religious congregation died due to the virus. The first information report (FIR) was filed on March 31, soon after more than 2,300 people, including foreigners, were evacuated from the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters.The headquarters, known as the Markaz, went on to emerge as the biggest Covid-19 cluster in India, leading to a spurt in the rate of infection in the city. A total of 915 foreigners from at least 34 different countries have already been charge-sheeted in the case.A crime branch officer, on condition of anonymity, said ASI Sanjeev Kumar complained of fever and sore throat on June 8, after which his testing was done at the RML hospital.“As his report came positive, he was home quarantined. On June 10, he developed breathing problems and was first admitted to RML hospital. He was later shifted to GTB hospital the same day, where he died on Friday evening,” the officer said, adding that the ASI is survived by his wife and two children who live in north-east Delhi’s Maujpur. This is the second death of a policeman due of the Covid-19 since Tuesday, -- 59-year-old sub-inspector (SI) Karambir Singh had died of the virus during his treatment at the Army Base hospital. SI Singh was the driver of assistant commissioner of police (ACP) of Seelampur, Saurabh Chandra. Amit Kumar, 31-year-old constable of Bharat Nagar police station, was the first casualty of the virus on May 5. After Kumar, two assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs), Shesh Mani Pandey and Vikram, both in their 50s, died on May 30 and May 31, respectively, at the Army Base Hospital. Since April, at least 700 Delhi Police personnel have tested positive for the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-asi-dies-of-covid-19-death-toll-in-the-force-now-five/story-LeBqbrH07glCuyxQzSfgPI.html

13-06-2020||Pune||Four prominent educational institutes in Pune come forward to raise challenges in education field||Four prominent educational institutions in the city came together on Friday to raise their demands and share challenges they face due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Deccan Education Society (DES), Maharashtra Education Society (MES), Maharshi Karve Stree Shikshan Samstha, (MKSSS) and Shikshan Prasaraka Mandalli (SPM) sought financial help from the state government to run schools and colleges. They also sought cancellation of centralised admission procedure for entrance exams and allow them to set timetable for admissions for the academic year.The press conference held at MES’s Abasaheb Garware College on Friday was attended by Sharad Kunte, chairman of DES; Rajiv Sahasrabudhe, chairman of the governing body of MES; advocate SK Jain, president of Shikshan Prasarak Mandali and Promoad Gorhe chairman of MKSSS, along with other officials of all these institutions.“Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many educational institutions are facing financial issues. As 40 per cent of our students come from rural parts, they too are facing financial crisis whether they would be able to pay fee or not is a big question,” said Kunte.“We are working on online models to resume lectures, but it needs a lot of funds. We are doing a survey to check how to reach students for online studies, but staff crunch, infrastructure and need of new equipment for online classes are issued to be addressed. We have till now spend Rs 1 crore to get licenses of software and other related things to hold online lectures.” he said.“Hence, we appeal to the state government is to make us a way out from this crisis and save the academic year. We request the government to cancel centralised admission for one year. We are ready to conduct exams for third year students according to guidelines given by the government.

13-06-2020||Pune||Covid growth rate in Bhavani peth slows, but green zone of Aundh-Baner ward reports more cases||Pune’s Bhavani Peth ward office that was reporting high number of Covid positive cases till recently has seen signs of improvement with area now reporting lowest growth rate of 8 % among fresh cases. On the other hand, Aundh-Baner ward, which till May was in green zone, has thrown high number of cases, taking it to first spot in growth rate as high as 261%.The Pune Municipal Corporation has a total of 15 regional ward offices. Among its Bhavani peth ward office was worst affected and till date most of the parts falling in this ward office are containment zones. Most of the slums, including Kashewadi, Lohianagar, Mominpura, Raviwar peth, Guruwar peth and Pune station area had reported high number of positive cases. As on June 8, this ward office area had 107 active Covid-19 cases. Aundh Baner ward office was in the green zone, but number of positive cases started going up since first week of June and now has it has 84 active cases as on June 8. Till last week of May, this ward office had only 20 cases.Dr Vaishali Jadhav, deputy health chief in Pune Municipal Corporation and in of contact tracing for the whole city, said, “As most parts of Bhavani peth ward office area are falling in containment zones, preventing any activity, the growth rate of the Covid-19 positive cases have come down. But as the relaxation has been given to the rest of the city, numbers of cases are increasing out of non-containment zones. It’s natural that if the people’s movement would increase, cases would increase in new areas. This process would continue for the next couple of months. Red zones would become green and green areas would turn into red zones.”According to Sugar commissioner Saurabh Rao, who has been given the responsibility of the Bhavani peth and Dhole Patil road ward offices, efforts undertaken by civic authorities in Bhavani peth have borne results. “Mainly, we increased contact tracing in the containment zones. We have even started early detection in these areas. Early detection is key as it helps to bring down the mortality rate as well as helps to bring down spread of coronavirus.”Dhole Patil ward officer Dayanand Sonkamble said, “We concentrated on cleaning of community toilets as well as distributed ration kits door to door. Even took effort to sell vegetables at doorstep, which helped to get control over the spread of Covid-19.”Aundh-Baner ward officer Jaydeep Pawar said, “Positive cases are increasing mainly in slum areas falling in Bopodi area. We closed the internal roads in these areas and even closed the vegetable and fish markets in these areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-growth-rate-in-bhavani-peth-slows-but-green-zone-of-aundh-baner-ward-reports-more-cases/story-MS1K6Sphs18OSWISyQ0aYK.html
13-06-2020||Gurugram||City to breach 3k Covid-19 cases today as health department clears backlog of samples||The total count of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus is about to breach the 3,000 mark in the city.And the worst is yet to come, health department officials warned.  With 185 new Covid-19 cases reported on Friday, the tally of people affected with the virus has reached 2,922. Out of this, only 976 have been discharged so far, while 1,927 remain hospitalized or in home isolated. SO far, at least 19 people have succumbed to the virus. Health department officials stated that the rapid surge in number of cases may continue as they clear a backlog samples, which have been collected but not yet sent to government labs for testing. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “As many as 720 samples from the last two days have been sent for testing to labs in Rohtak, Nalhar, Sonepat and Karnal. Clearing backlog of samples collected in the last few days is crucial to get the exact picture of the current Covid-19 situation in the district. The issue of pending samples has to be resolved to reduce the time gap between sample collection and test results.”Currently, the time gap between sample collection and test result is almost 3-5 days, which is leading to the rapid transmission of Covid-19 cases. “Pendency of cases is at two level. One, we collect the sample but it is sent to the labs in two to three days. Second, backlog is created when there is a delay in testing too. The department is trying to clear the backlog of samples collected for now,” said Yadav, who took charge of Gurugram district’s chief medical officer amid the raging Covid-19 crisis on Thursday.Data shows that in the last one month, samples collected on a daily basis has increased from 200 to 400. However, with this, the backlog of cases has fluctuated too. In first week of June alone, 394 samples were pending. Experts, however, said that a backlog impacts the overall positivity rate. Public health expert Dr Preeti Kumar, who is the vice president at Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), said that the key to manage a pandemic is to have real time data. “Backlog of cases will create a mismatch between the total number of people tested positive and the number of actual samples collected in a day. It will lead to an artificially higher number of cases in a day due to delay in samples sent to labs for testing and the declaration of results.”She added, “Since the total positive cases will not match the actual test done on a single day, it will impact the test positivity rate too. In response to that, epidemiologists takes 5-7 days of moving average data.” In May the average test positivity rate of Gurugram was 9%, which increased to almost 44% in June, the highest for any district in the state so far. Experts have pointed out that the higher positivity rate indicates increased testing to rule out wider spread.Currently,Gurugram has 50% Covid-19 burden of the state. Haryana till date has reported 6,334 cases, out of which 3,789 are active while 2,475 patients have been discharged. The death toll across the state stands at 70.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-to-breach-3k-cases-today-as-health-department-clears-backlog-of-samples/story-7elmD6dyh1iYmiI8npnGVI.html

13-06-2020||Chandigarh||School fee issue: Hearing to continue in Punjab and Haryana HC on Monday||The Punjab and Haryana high court will continue hearing the petitions filed by schools and parents from Punjab over collection of fee amid Covid-19 outbreak, on Monday.On Friday, hearing continued for around three hours before the bench of justice Nirmaljit Kaur and Punjab government and schools’ counsels concluded their arguments. Lawyers from the parents’ bodies will start their arguments on Monday.On May 22, the HC, acting on schools’ plea, had allowed them to charge 70% fee from students for the academic year 2020-2021. The court had also allowed schools to charge admission fee in two half-yearly instalments. The decision had resulted in widespread protests by parents in Punjab. The state has now sought modification of the order stating that they had put some conditions on fee collection in view of Covid-19 outbreak under the Epidemics Diseases Act, 1897, in view of complaints from parents. Also, it has been argued that state was well within its power to issue such orders with the issue at hand being a policy matter.On the other hand, schools have argued that they are well within their right to collect fee and if they do not charge fee how will they pay salaries to teachers. They further argued that online classes were held.Schools have raised the issue of validity of instructions passed by the state administration from time-to-time since March with regard to not increasing school fee, deferring collection of school fee in view of the Covid-19 outbreak, and not sending reminders to parents to pay the fee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/school-fee-issue-hearing-to-continue-in-punjab-and-haryana-hc-on-monday/story-MYupoaGceKr26tEjpTDGeP.html
13-06-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh debate: It’s time to quarantine Chandigarh against crimes||Root out criminals from societyThe Swachh Bharat project should go beyond cleaning of cities and also eliminate criminals, dishonest and corrupt government representatives and officials from society. Policemen need professional training and skill sets to handle law and order. Give them better pay packages, better, modern and user-friendly equipment, especially bulletproof vests. The attacks on police personnel should be tried under laws applicable to terrorists for undermining the legitimate authority of the state.Policemen need to undertake an image makeover to instil fear in criminals. There should be zero tolerance to corruption and those who indulge in such activities should be subject to censures and suspensions from service for not doing their duty.Politicisation of the police force should end, since this has corroded discipline and made police officials the puppets of parties in power. Policemen should be recalled from VIP duties and assigned duties at local police stations.There should be a beat constable system in place in localities and sectors. Locals can also be appointed as honorary citizen wardens. This has been an effective tool to control petty crimes in Delhi NCR, Mumbai and most cities of Gujarat, especially burglaries, chain snatching and vehicle thefts.Physical fitness of cops is a major area of concern. Regular yoga and meditation camps should be held for them.Rajiv Boolchand Jain, ZirakpurWhat about our moral behaviour?Other than advising that security be beefed up in the city, what else does the administrator have to say? It reminds me of a cartoon published in a daily when terrorism was rife in Punjab, showing an extra drum being placed at a naka to stop the movement of terrorists when orders were issued by the authorities then to strengthen the security system. The police have so far done a commendable job to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, some of them have lost their lives and others have been seriously wounded while ensuring social distancing. One should not forget that police personnel too are human beings. They are overworked. We need to strengthen the force and recruit more personnel so that the men and women are not overworked. It is difficult to get information beforehand about personal rivalries, unless individuals inform the police and seek protection. Maybe one is stealing ornaments from temples because of starvation due to unemployment after the Covid-19 lockdown. We always talk of corrupt police but we never talk about our own moral behaviour and financial corruption. If the business deals are fair, rivalries will not crop up. Gurdev Singh, MohaliBetter coordination required between tricity policeMohali, Chandigarh and Panchkula police should work together with greater coordination and be more vigilant. Patrolling should be increased. The courts must also ensure that habitual offenders are removed from society for extended periods of time. The public must also be educated about steps to be followed should they become the victims of robbers or thieves and report all details to the police. Advanced CCTV cameras should be installed everywhere in the tricity. Regular nakas should be set up at as many points as possible. An operational helpline should be set up for people to complain against crimes. The police should have access to modern weapons. Rewards should be given to those who provide valuable information to the police. Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhEquip police with high-tech gadgetsDuring the Covid-19 lockdown anti-social elements were invisible out of fear of contracting the infection. However, after recent relaxations they have become active again. The recent shootouts and temple theft have created fear in the city. Certain steps need to be taken immediately such as ensuring intensive patrolling as the presence of men in khaki instils fear among criminals. Having more police beats and nakas, functional latest CCTV cameras and streetlights, PCR vans at critical points, especially at night, is imperative. The police must be provided latest high-tech gadgets for self-defence. Co-ordination among all the police stations is vital as increased vigil at state and UT borders will prevent the criminals from escaping. The law must not spare culprits who enjoy the patronage of VIPs or have an unholy nexus with the police.Usha Verma, ChandigarhTime to ask some tough questionsWelcome to the new normal after Covid-19, when criminals have suddenly decided they will scare the living daylights out of tax paying citizens and extort money from them, very much like D-Company during the bad old days in Mumbai. It’s a joke. Associates of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who as we all know is now in a jail in Rajasthan, say they have been communicating via cellphones with him to arrange for arms and ammunition and then identify and instil fear in soft targets and extort money from them. First of all, how is Bishnoi making calls from prison? Who is in charge of that prison and why is he not immediately made accountable for letting a dreaded gangster conduct his “business” from behind bars as if it’s his corporate office? Why is this man not being put in a maximum security isolated cell instead of running this dreadful show? Why are the courts not doing anything to stop honest taxpaying public from being held to ransom by such gangs? Is it not enough for people to live with the threat of the pandemic? Should they now be subject to threat and intimidation by criminals who have no fear because they have protection from politicians and the state? Let us start asking questions first and demanding that law enforcement authorities and administrators answer them first.BL SharmaIdentify troublemakers when they are young The government should beef up security and install CCTV cameras to curb crime in and around city. Nakas should be put up at different parts of the city and in the border areas too. The government should maintain a separate database of criminals . Photographs and details of those wanted in criminal cases should be put online on police websites to inform the public about them. Plainclothesmen should be deployed extensively to keep an eye on proclaimed offenders. Proper verification of migrants, paying guests and tenants should be done from time to time. The government also needs to be more strict while issuing arms and ammunition licences. The masses need to learn defence techniques and to be more proactive and alert to protect themselves. The government should also start a project to identify troublemakers at the college level and work to rehabilitate them so that they do not take to a life of crime. Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliCity beautiful now playground of gangsTwo shootouts in three days is nothing new as crimes have become routine here. Many criminal acts of murder and rape remain untraced in the city even after decades. It is tragic that a progressive and once-beautiful city like Chandigarh is not a peaceful place anymore and has turned into a hub of criminal activities with easy accessibility and a safe haven for antisocial elements. Criminal gangs are operating from behind the high walls of prisons safely. Picking up their targets, arranging vehicles, weapons and shooters to execute their plans smoothly without fail. They have the audacity and resources to carry out their nefarious activities when the whole country is under lockdown due to Covid-19 and security forces are engaged with many other responsibilities. Until and unless all such criminal gangs are neutralised with better intelligence, sophisticated gadgets and means of communication, the citizens will continue to live in fear. The tricity’s security agencies should ensure better coordination to crush all such elements ruthlessly.Suresh Verma, Chandigarh Keep young people occupiedThe rot has already set in the system. Young men today think are making a style statement by posting pictures on Facebook holding guns, as if it’s the most glamorous thing in the world. Look at their dependency on drugs, their fondness for songs on flashy cars, weapons and alcohol. Today there is no outlet for them to expend their energies and they think that working for a gang is the best way to earn a quick buck, not realising that the consequences of such acts. No police bandobust or CCTV camera is going to stop crimes, especially now with the economy on the downswing and people out of jobs. The immediate focus of state governments and administrations is to exhort industries and businesses that have started work to create more job avenues. Then, when the pandemic is under control and social distancing not required, small village-level sporting competitions with attractive prizes should be set up to keep the youth active. Other measures can also be taken later such as evening gatherings at villages where documentaries on the lives of great people or movies with positive messages are shown to help in their moral development.AK Gupta, Mohali||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/it-s-time-to-quarantine-chandigarh-against-crimes/story-rZi5UkHpLxm8mHrsOxHXyO.html

He was admitted in a serious condition with pneumonia and required oxygen therapy. The doctors observed that the patient was taken off the oxygen therapy in just three days and gradually his condition improved with the help of plasma therapy and supportive care. PGIMER director Jagat Ram said, “The results have been encouraging as the recovery time decreased than the usual period. The plasma administered on other two patients has shown no side effects. The exact outcome will be known after conclusion of the trial.”Professor Pankaj Malhotra from department of internal medicine said, “PGIMER is one of the centres of ICMR national trial on convalescent plasma therapy for Covid-19 positive patients who require oxygen therapy. PGI was chosen as one of the ICMR site in the last week of April. The first patient donated plasma on May 9 and the first one who became eligible to get plasma therapy was enrolled on June 1.”Professor GD Puri, dean (academics) and head of department of anasthaesia and intensive care, said, “The successful recovery with plasma therapy is a positive indicator. The trial is a teamwork of the department of internal medicine, anesthesiology and intensive care, transfusion medicine, virology, community medicine and public health and endocrinology. We will need more donors to come forward for plasma therapy clinical trials. We have to counsel the patients who have recovered and their relatives to convince them to donate blood.”Head of department of transfusion medicine professor Rati Ram Sharma, who played a pivotal role in the therapy, said, “This is a great moment for all of us at PGIMER as a critically ill patient recovered with the help of convalescent plasma therapy. We are grateful to those who came forward to donate plasma for this noble cause and hope that many more will follow so that the same therapy can be provided to the needy patients as well.” WHAT IS CONVALESCENT PLASMA THERAPY?Convalescent plasma therapy involves taking antibodies from cured Covid-19 patients and injecting them in the blood of patients suffering from the disease. The transfusion of plasma is carried out through a machine which separates the plasma from the blood which is then retransferred into the donor. The plasma thus obtained is injected into a sick coronavirus patient. A donor supplies 300-500 ml of plasma and the transfusion process takes between 60-90 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-s-first-covid-19-patient-treated-with-plasma-therapy-recovers/story-sObaiYZTlclGBwdzns2MMN.html

He credited the less number of positive cases in Kharar to the local authorities who are working everyday to serve the people.He added that the situation is under control due to the decisive steps taken by Capt Amarinder Singh led state government and the health department. Assuring the administration of any assistance in the war against Covid-19, Tewari said the situation in Punjab has been largely brought under control due to timely and effective measures initiated by the state government, as compared to rapid pace with which the cases are increasing in other parts of the country and the world.He said, “Punjab has less number of positive cases and mortality rate in comparison to other states. The recovery rate is also far better than others for which the health department, police and the administration deserve an applause.”He added that people must be on guard as slightest faltering at this stage can lead to dangerous consequences. Tewari also advised people to wear masks when going out or cover their faces with handkerchief, or a cloth and follow social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tewari-visits-kharar-sdm-office-expresses-gratitude-to-covid-warriors/story-A20NXTcF32sKB52KRjQYsM.html
13-06-2020||Chandigarh||Panchkula ill-prepared for monsoon||The monsoon season is just round the corner, but Panchkula is not yet ready to deal with problems that arise after rain. Road gullies are clogged and the bumpy ride begins the moment one enters the city. Sector 18 roundabout is damaged and the dividing road of sector 5 and 6 is mostly covered with pits. The worst is sector 1-2 dividing road that leads to the national highway 73. Similar is the condition of roads leading to the deputy commissioner office, Mother Teresa Saket Hospital, sector 4 market and the one opposite the MC office. During monsoons, one often finds the Shahid Uddam Singh Chowk and the road gullies around it clogged with water.Panchkula Citizens Welfare Association president SK Nayar said, “Around 20 days ago, I had written to the municipal commissioner about the issues faced by the residents during monsoons, including the pitiable condition of road gullies. However, there was no response.”Nayar said the situation is so bad that even a day’s rain leads to waterclogging. “Every year during monsoons, the roundabouts and several sectors are choked, causing inconvenience to residents,” he added.A letter written by Nayar to the MC states: “Over 80% road gullies are blocked in the city. The members of the association request the concerned officials to take immediate preventive measures to maintain and clean all road-gullies in the city before the arrival of rainy season.”A senior MC official said, “The tender has been allotted to clean over 10,000 road gullies and manholes by June 30. Sector wise areas, including sector 9, 8, 19, have already been mapped. The work will start in a day or two.”“Besides, repair work related to rain water harvesting has also been assigned and it will be done by June 20.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panchkula-ill-prepared-for-monsoons/story-IegKdQhRuUg0HKtomSYPoL.html

As there is a lot of fear regarding the virus spread, we decided to appoint cured patients as brand ambassadors and their strong emotional appeal has shown positive results.”“They (brand ambassadors) are voluntarily helping us. Some of them accompany the health teams and speak to citizens in containment zones. We have even prepared videos and circulated it in among citizens living in high-risk areas,” he said.Bhosale and Shaikh’s efforts is getting positive results in Tadiwala slum areas.Shaikh said, “The virus affected our whole family, and we all are cured and completed the isolation period. I am appealing to people to come forward if they show any symptoms and defeat Covid-19 as I did and get information and treatment with the help of doctors, police and the administration.”Bhosale said, “My kids and I recovered from Covid-19. We don’t need to be frightened. If anyone has any problem, they should immediately go to the hospital. Hygiene should be maintained at home like frequent hand washing.”The civic body’s initiative also received praise from the central team which recently visited the city and recommended it to extend it to other parts.According to Dhole Patil ward regional ward officer Dayanand Sonkamble, the appeals made by cured patients have been effective.“The Tadiwala slum has a population of 57,000 and daily 70 to 80 positive cases are being reported from the slum. The appeals made by cured citizens have seen a fall in positive cases. Now, we see single-digit cases and even zero on some days from the slum,” Sonkamble said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cured-residents-join-fight-against-covid-19-in-pune/story-yXM9AcILpJ31obaZDZdxlL.html

The 43-year-old Khan is the father of the teenager.The police suspect the notes have been procured through multiple consignments over the past five to six months from multiple markets in Mumbai.The defence counsel, however, countered the charge saying “These notes have ‘Children’s Bank of India’ written on them. They can be made available through markets and are used in games. How can they be termed as fake notes? This does not amount to cheating,” argued the defence lawyer Rajendra Sonawale.Public prosecutor Nitin Konghe argued, “If it was not meant for cheating, why were bundles of fake notes covered with real notes on top?”“They offered visual proof of USD to people who wanted American currency and proof of Indian currency to people seeking Indian currency. Now, whether it was to convert black to white or the other way round is a part of the investigation. In the visuals, if you see, it looks like they have the money they claim to have, but a close look will immediately reveal that the currency is fake,” said police inspector Anjum Bagwan, unit 4 of Pune police crime branch, who is investigating the case.Earlier, the police asked for custody remand in order to ascertain the number of people who were duped before a police decoy caught them in the act on Wednesday.“In investigation till now, the accused used to send videos of the currency to gullible people having black money and make hawala deals, and cheat them by giving fake/token notes covered with few real notes. They seemed to have cheated quite a few people with their modus,” said Bachchan Singh, deputy commissioner of police, crime, Pune.The fake notes were used to show visual proof of availability to the customers who showed readiness to pay. There are multiple customer organisations that were duped in this manner by these men. So far, there are no other suspects in the case besides the six, according to officials.However, DCP Singh said, “Since the amount involved is huge, further investigation is going on to find involvement of more people, and the beneficiaries of the crime. We also request people who have been cheated by such methods to come forward and share details.”A case under Sections 489(a)(b)(c), 420 (cheating), 120(b) (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Vimantal police station against the six.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fake-currency-racket-six-get-4-day-police-custody-probe-on-to-track-source-of-notes/story-B2IIZxDSdFR9FWp6ZhLf0H.html

The largest buyer in the country, Hindustan Latex Limited (HLL), a designated nodal procurement agency of Covid-19 emergency supplies for Government of India, has temporarily applied brakes on new orders, owing to issues concerning quality control.There are 121 certified units for manufacturing PPEs in the state, of which 108 are in Ludhiana. At least 12 of these 108 firms in Ludhiana were the sole suppliers to HLL and received orders to manufacture PPE suits in lakhs earlier. The decision will indirectly affect other vendors as well.A recent order by the HLL (email accessed by HT) to its vendors reads, “You are requested to stop all further supplies since we are reviewing the quality of coveralls supplied by the manufacturers.”The orders have come as a jolt to Ludhiana’s textile industry. Ludhiana Knitwear Club president Vinod Thapar said that in these troubled times, making PPEs had come as a ray of hope to manufacturers, who worked with full zeal to meet the demand of the country. “Quality checks were conducted before the licence to manufacture was approved. It is unfortunate that the orders have been halted,” he said.One of the manufacturers, requesting anonymity, said that HLL Lifecare Ltd instructing suppliers to stop all supplies for uncertain / indefinite time had created bottlenecks in the factories, forcing manufacturers into financial and operational difficulties.The PPE manufacturers who are faced with the issue of surplus production and less demand are now looking at the government to open export.“We are in surplus production already. The price of the PPEs has also fallen. We have requested government to allow exports,” said Akhil Malhotra of Shiva Tex Fab in Ludhiana.Punjab industries director Sibin C said the orders may have been halted due to higher specifications imposed by the Union health ministry. “Since there is over production and low domestic demand, we have already requested the GOI to allow exports,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-textile-firms-in-fix-as-largest-buyer-halts-new-ppe-orders/story-QQsw9nbiieXfi7k7j3aP8O.html

A PhD in Economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Fernandes has been part of Costa’s team since 2015.Fernandes’ family hails from Sarzora in Salcette, and retains links with the extended family in Panaji, where his grand-father, Leão Fernandes, taught in the Portuguese-era school in Altinho: Lyceum (today it houses the Goa bench of the Bombay high court).The media in Portugal quoted former minister Alvaro Santos Pereira as saying that Fernandes is an “excellent” choice for the key ministry. He held several academic roles before taking on policy-making responsibilities in the government.Prime Minister Costa, 58, heads the minority Socialist (PS) government since the October 2019 election. He was presented the Overseas Citizen of India card by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a visit to Lisbon in June 2017. Costa visited his ancestral home in Goa in early 2017.The Goa-Portugal link is one among several strands of the Indian disapora.

The new cases at Xinfadi wholesale food market has raised concern among the people as it supplies 90 per cent of the capital’s vegetables and meat products catering to about 20 million people. Along with the Xinfadi market six other markets were closed on Saturday. Officials in Beijing found the coronavirus strand on a chopping board of imported salmon at the Xinfadi market following which the fish stocks were removed from Chaoshifa market, Carrefour and Wumart stores in the city. China imports about 80,000 tonnes of frozen salmon every year. Chile, Norway, Faroe Islands, Australia and Canada are the main exporters to China. Lin Li, chief scientist of a team that monitors aquatic disease and control in Guangdong Province, told the Global Times it is not possible for live salmon to be contaminated with the virus as it breeds in the ocean, neither can frozen salmon be a source of COVID-19 which can only exist in active cells. Forty-six people in Beijing have tested positive for the coronavirus over the last few days, the Global Times report said. Local municipal officials, who addressed the media, said they could not rule out the possibility of additional cases in Beijing. All the 46 positive cases were connected to local markets but none have symptoms. They are under close medical observation, Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the municipal centre for disease prevention and control, told a media briefing here on Saturday. Of the 517 samples taken at the Xinfadi wholesale market in Beijing’s Fengtai district, 45 people’s throat swabs tested positive for the virus. Another person connected to a market in Beijing’s Haidian district also tested positive, the daily reported. Forty environmental samples collected at the Xinfadi market also tested positive. Testing of some 10,000 people who have connections to the market began after six confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported on Friday, following a single new confirmed case on Thursday. The new cases have brought a sense of disquiet in Beijing which in the last two months was being projected as safe. The government went ahead with its ten-day Parliament session and officially relaxed the guard with the municipal council recommending the people to do away with masks. In response to the emergency, Fengtai district has been put on “wartime” activity with close management of the 11 residential areas around Xinfadi market. Officials are manning the area at all hours, the report said. Three schools and six kindergartens near Xinfadi market have stopped classes. The risk level at Beijing’s Xicheng district for its Yuetan community has risen from low to medium. Beijing plans to carry out widespread nucleic acid tests of people who have had close contacts with the Xinfadi market since May 30. Currently, Beijing’s 98 nucleic acid testing institutions can process 90,000 tests a day, which has met the needs for testing in the capital, city health commission spokesperson Gao Xiaojun said at a press conference. The reopening of elementary schools, which was scheduled for Monday, has been postponed. Earlier, China’s National Health Commission (NHC) said that 18 new confirmed coronavirus cases were reported in the country on Friday, including six domestically-transmitted cases in Beijing. Also on Friday, seven new asymptomatic cases were reported, taking the total number of such people in quarantine to 98, it said. As of Friday, the overall confirmed cases in China had reached 83,075, including 74 patients who were still being treated, with no one in severe condition. In all, 78,367 people have been discharged after recovery and 4,634 people have died of Covid-19, NHC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-to-implement-wartime-measures-as-46-people-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-NeLJZFChLsFYgvFwHWnIiJ.html

Flares and bottles were hurled at the police in the square where the statues of Churchill, Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela were boarded up. The BLM campaigners remained in Hyde Park and later dispersed, with plans to protest later in the week.As footage emerged of clashes with the police, home secretary Priti Patel tweeted: “Thoroughly unacceptable thuggery. Any perpetrators of violence or vandalism should expect to face the full force of the law. Violence towards our police officers will not be tolerated”.“Coronavirus remains a threat to us all. Go home to stop the spread of this virus & save lives”, she added, as reports came from protests from Bristol, Brighton and other towns across the UK.In Leicester, some councillors, residents and former MP Keith Vaz formed a cordon around Gandhi’s statue, while an online petition calling for the statue’s removal was closed after it enlisted over 6,000 signatures. The local council will be considering the petition as part of a wider review of public spaces.Descendants of Churchill and those instrumental in setting up Gandhi’s statue in London in 2015 regretted that their statues needed to be protected, with Patel and others calling for the protective boards to be removed soon.According to London mayor Sadiq Khan, his office had intelligence that far-right groups were planning protests with potential of violence, and attack Mandela’s statue. The Greater London Authority under him is responsible for the statues in Parliament Square.Meghnad Desai, chairman of the Gandhi Memorial Statue Trust, said: “It is a pity and a shame that the Gandhi statue in Parliament Square is to be covered up ahead of the BLM rally today. Gandhi has nothing to hide. He is a pioneer of the struggle against imperialism and racism who inspired Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela”.Gandhi and Churchill statues were among those attacked by BLM protestors last Sunday.Nicholas Soames, Churchill’s grandson and former Conservative minister, said he was “deeply upset” at the statue being covered, adding that British society, according to him, has “lost its moral compass”.He said: “I find it extraordinary that millions and millions of people all over the world who look up to Britain will be astonished that a statue of Churchill and the Cenotaph, our national war memorial, could have been defaced in this disgusting way.”Emma Soames, Churchill’s grand-daughter, wants the statue to be placed in a museum: “It’s extraordinarily sad that my grandfather, who was such a unifying figure in this country, appears to have become a sort of icon through being controversial.”“I think on the whole, people weren’t looking at the entire record of people when they put up statues for them, and even if they did we’d be living in a country of empty plinths I think”, she said, adding that the sight of her grandfather boarded up was “shocking”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clashes-mar-london-protests-near-covered-gandhi-churchill-statues/story-JAVVfUIKZC0zLpYGoeIMiL.html

The agreement with AstraZeneca also aims to make the vaccine available to other European countries that wish to take part.The cost is expected to be offset by funding from the governments.“This agreement will ensure that hundreds of millions of Europeans have access to Oxford University’s vaccine following approval,’’ AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said. “With our European supply chain due to begin production soon, we hope to make the vaccine available widely and rapidly.’‘The agreement is the latest in a series to make the vaccine — even though it is not certain it will work. But so desperate is the need that scaling up of manufacturing continues despite the risk.The Anglo-Swedish company recently completed similar agreements with Britain, the United States the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance for 700 million doses. A license also has been agreed with the Serum Institute of India for another 1 billion doses.The vaccine was developed by Oxford University’s Jenner Institute, working with the Oxford Vaccine Group.Testing of the experimental Covid-19 vaccine began in healthy volunteers in Britain in April with over 1,000 people aged 18 to 55. Another round with 10,000 volunteers began last month.Other companies, including Moderna and Sanofi, are racing to develop and produce a vaccine against the new coronavirus, a step experts say will be crucial to allowing countries to ease their lockdowns and restrictions on public life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-agrees-to-make-covid-19-vaccine-for-europe/story-vei9QOxxC1bypZHU8CkOqJ.html
13-06-2020||World||Reseachers in Thailand testing horseshoe bats for coronavirus||Researchers in Thailand began collecting samples from horseshoe bats to test them for coronavirus amid concerns they may pose a threat to local residents, a government statement said on Saturday.They plan to collect 300 bats over three days from a cave in the Chanthaburi province in the southeast of the country. The bats will be released following the tests. Thailand has 23 species of the horseshoe bat, but there has not been an investigation before.The source of the virus remains a matter of debate after it emerged in China late last year.The World Health Organization (WHO) in April said that all available evidence suggests that it originated in bats in China, but it was not clear how the virus had jumped the species barrier to humans. The research team in Thailand includes Supaporn Wacharapluesadee, who identified the country’s first case of Covid-19 in January. “The reason we need to investigate the horseshoe bat is because there are reports from China that the Covid-19 virus is similar to the virus found in the horseshoe bat,” Supaporn said.Thailand was the first country outside China to record a case of the virus. It has so far reported 3,134 cases and 58 deaths. Researchers from the National Parks Department, Chulalongkorn Hospital and Kasetsart University entered the cave on Thursday evening and re-emerged in the early hours of Friday with samples of bat blood, saliva and feces.Investigators were concerned that villagers in the area could be at risk of infection.

On Thursday, Shehbaz Sharif, chief of the Opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), tested positive for the coronavirus after he appeared before the NAB in a money laundering case. Gilani’s son Kasim Gilani announced on Twitter that the former premier had tested positive for the coronavirus.“Thank you Imran Khan’s govt and National Accountability Bureau! You have successfully put my father’s life in danger. His COVID-19 result came positive,” Kasim said.Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi also tested positive for the coronavirus on Saturday. Pakistan’s Covid-19 cases reached 132,405 after a record 6,472 new infections were detected, while 88 more people have succumbed to the coronavirus, pushing the death toll to 2,551, the health ministry said on Saturday.The Ministry of National Health Services said a record 29,850 tests were done in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of Covid-19 tests conducted in the country to 839,019.“So far, 50,056 people have recovered across Pakistan, making it a significant count,” it said.There are no patients on ventilators in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Balochistan. As many as 420 ventilators out of a total 1,400 breathing devices allocated for COVID-19 are occupied across Pakistan, it said.Out of the total 132,405 cases detected so far, Punjab has recorded 50,087. A total of 49,256 infections have been reported in Sindh, 16,415 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 7,866 in Balochistan, 7,163 in Islamabad, 1,044 in Gilgit-Baltistan and 574 in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.At least 88 people have died in the last 24 hours, taking the total death toll to 2,551, the ministry said.There are 820 hospitals with Covid-19 facilities in the country and 8,559 patients are admitted across the country, while others are recuperating in self-isolation at homes, it added.The government closed down nearly 1,300 hot spots, including several areas in capital Islamabad, on Saturday due to fast spreading of the deadly virus. “Total 1,292 smart lockdowns enforce throughout the country,” National Command and Operation Center (NCOC) said.It said that the federal and provincial authorities were ensuring compliance with health guidelines and instructions for the working places and following track, test and quarantine strategy. A total of 844 areas in Punjab are under smart lockdown, 414 areas in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 12 in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, 10 in Islamabad, 7 in Sindh and 5 in Gilgit-Baltistan, it said.More than 1,541 shops, 33 industries and 1,429 vehicles were cautioned or fined or sealed, it said.“To ensure the implementation of the health guidelines/instructions and preventive measures, special teams are operating all across the country to ensure that the SOPs are being implemented,” NCOC said. Meanwhile, Pakistan medical goods watchdog has approved the first indigenously made testing kit for the novel coronavirus.Minister of Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry said that the kit was developed by the scientists at the army-run National University of Science and Technology (NUST).The kit was approved by the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) after it completed successful rounds of trials.“Another landmark achieved.... DRAP has approved Pakistan first COVID testing kit, Congratulations to @Official NUST and our brilliant scientists ...you people have made us proud ... this will bring significant cost reduction of Covid tests also will save huge import bill,” Chaudhry tweeted on Friday.These testing kits will cost one-fourth of the current price for the kits used for detecting Covid-19. The kits have been efficiently tested on laboratory controls and patient samples.The kit was developed in collaboration with Wuhan Institute of Virology China, DZIF Germany, Columbia University, US and Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-pak-pm-yusuf-raza-gilani-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-JvyQKyafz6eaACkzRq6gZP.html

The Greater London Authority under him is responsible for the statues in Parliament Square.Meghnad Desai, chairman of the Gandhi Memorial Statue Trust, said: “It is a pity and a shame that the Gandhi statue in Parliament Square is to be covered up ahead of the BLM rally today. Gandhi has nothing to hide”.“He is a pioneer of the struggle against imperialism and racism who inspired Dr. Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela,” he added, amidst calls by home secretary Priti Patel and others to remove the protective covering around the statues.The statues of Churchill, Gandhi, Mandela in Parliament Square and the Cenotaph in nearby Whitehall have been boarded up to prevent them from being targeted. Last Sunday, Gandhi and Churchill statues were among those attacked by BLM protestors.Nicholas Soames, Churchill’s grandson and former Conservative minister, said he was “deeply upset” at the statue being covered, adding that British society, according to him, has “lost its moral compass”.He said: “I find it extraordinary that millions and millions of people all over the world who look up to Britain will be astonished that a statue of Churchill and the Cenotaph, our national war memorial, could have been defaced in this disgusting way.”Emma Soames, Churchill’s grand-daughter, wants the statue to be placed in a museum: “It’s extraordinarily sad that my grandfather, who was such a unifying figure in this country, appears to have become a sort of icon through being controversial.”“I think on the whole, people weren’t looking at the entire record of people when they put up statues for them, and even if they did we’d be living in a country of empty plinths I think”, she said, adding that the sight of her grandfather boarded up was “shocking”.Scotland Yard imposed time and route restrictions on the protests by groups that include BLM, right wing and left wing affiliated groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-protests-on-despair-over-covering-gandhi-churchill-statues/story-bXghUCmhz7Rm2W0Glig9OP.html
13-06-2020||World||Wearing face masks best way to stop airborne spread of Covid-19, says study||Wearing face masks in public is the most effective method to prevent person-to-person spread of the coronavirus, a new study says, adding that it is the only way to prevent airborne transmission of the virus.Comparing data from the first pandemic epicentre in Wuhan in central China, Italy and New York city, the researchers argue that non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like social distancing, quarantine and contact tracing work the best when people wear masks.“This protective measure alone significantly reduced the number of infections, that is, by over 78,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and over 66,000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9,” the researchers from Texas A&M University, the University of Texas, the California Institute of Technology and University of California wrote in the paper.It said both the WHO and the US Centres for Disease Control “largely ignored the importance of airborne transmission route” of the disease even though both emphasised the prevention of contact transmission.It was only last week that the WHO changed its advice on face masks, saying they should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible.It said new information showed masks could provide “a barrier for potentially infectious droplets” -- a validation of this research paper.The organisation had earlier said there was not enough evidence to say that healthy people should wear masks.The WHO DG Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on June 6 that “…in light of evolving evidence, the WHO advises that governments should encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments”.The new study therefore is particularly relevant to India because wearing a mask is the most inexpensive yet effective way to prevent human-to-human transmission of the virus, if the findings of the study are to be believed.The paper says that government-mandated wearing of masks helped China in flattening the pandemic curve even as the numbers rise globally.“In contrast to China, wearing face masks was not mandated and was unpopular in most of the western world during the early outbreak of the pandemic. Advice on the use of face masks was not issued until April 6 by the WHO,” writes one of the authors Renyi Zhang from the department of atmospheric sciences, Texas A&M University.The peer-reviewed paper was published on June 11 in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) USA journal: “…analysis reveals that the difference with and without mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping the trends of the pandemic. This protective measure significantly reduces the number of infections. Other mitigation measures, such as social distancing implemented in the US, are insufficient by themselves in protecting the public.”Why is wearing a mask critical to combating the pandemic?Renyi Zhang explained that face covering prevents both airborne transmission and contact transmission.“On the other hand, social distancing, quarantine, and isolation, in conjunction with hand sanitising, minimise contact (direct and indirect) transmission but do not protect against airborne transmission. With social distancing, quarantine, and isolation in place worldwide and in the US since the beginning of April, airborne transmission represents the only viable route for spreading the disease, when mandated face covering is not implemented.”“We conclude that wearing of face masks in public corresponds to the most effective means to prevent interhuman transmission, and this inexpensive practice, in conjunction with extensive testing, quarantine, and contact tracking, poses the most probable fighting opportunity to stop the Covid-19 pandemic, prior to the development of a vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wearing-face-masks-best-way-to-stop-airborne-spread-of-covid-19-says-study/story-izwqQrCWgEPFoXtuH2ai6N.html

On Twitter Patel joined Prime Minister Boris Johnson in warning protesters they risked spreading the coronavirus.Some of the U.K.’s Black Lives Matter groups have said they will no longer attend the protests after reports that right-wing groups planned to descend on the capital to protect statues they see as possible targets for demonstrators. Authorities ordered historic statues of figures ranging from wartime leader Churchill to Nelson Mandela to be boarded up to protect against vandalism.Concern about statues of historic figures who may have racist pasts was heightened after protesters in the city of Bristol last weekend toppled the statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston and dumped it into the harbor there.London Mayor Khan has given his backing to the Black Lives Matter movement but also urged protesters to keep off the streets.Policing of Saturday’s protests is likely to be a contentious issue with a breakdown in relations between enforcement officers and the home secretary, the Times newspaper reported. Patel has come under criticism from police chiefs accused of “disgraceful” interference after she demanded a clamp down on the Black Lives Matter protests, the newspaper reported.Police reportedly took offense after Patel called out officers in Bristol for not intervening when protesters pulled down the statue on June 8. She has made clear she expects the perpetrators to face criminal charges, the paper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-priti-patel-condemns-covering-churchill-statue-before-protests/story-R22PAfI7SUwEyBMWShLz7K.html

The queen will receive a royal salute, which will be followed by military drills. Soldiers will march on the castle grounds in accordance with social distancing rules.The queen celebrated her 94th birthday on April 21, but her “official” birthday has always been marked with the Trooping the Color parade in June. The ‘colors’ refer to the flags representing the different regiments of the British Army.The event usually features hundreds of parading soldiers and horses, a carriage procession by the royal family, and a Royal Air Force flypast over Buckingham Palace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-s-birthday-marked-with-smaller-ceremony/story-5OGgZt49nORRv5DmKF8JjJ.html

In her message during a virtual commencement address, the 39-year-old Congresswoman from Hawaii said that it is a chaotic time and no one can say with certainty what tomorrow looks like. “… but we find certainty, strength and peace in the practice of Bhakti Yoga and Karma Yoga taught to us by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita,” Gabbard told the ‘Class of 2020 for Hindu students’. Her address came amidst protests in the US against the killing of African-American George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis. The country has been swept by protests since Floyd’s custodial death on May 25 with thousands of people mounting pressure for changes to the law enforcement practices. The first-ever virtual Hindu commencement was organised by the Hindu Students Council on June 7, which drew thousands of viewers on Facebook and YouTube Live, all coming together in solidarity during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the contagion has infected over 76,00,000 people and killed more than 4,25,000 across the world. The US is the worst affected country with over 2.04 million cases and more than 1,14,000 deaths. The COVID-19, which originated in China’s Wuhan city in December last year, has also battered the world economy with the International Monetary Fund saying that the global economy is bound to suffer a “severe recession”. Scientists are racing against time to find a vaccine or medicine for its treatment. Hundreds of graduates from the US, Canada, the UK, India and Australia attended to commemorate their graduation in a unique way - by celebrating their shared Hindu values. Professor Subhash Kak served as the ceremony’s Grand Marshall. “As you think about this new chapter in your lives, ask yourself what is my purpose in life? It is a deep question that if you can recognise now that your purpose is to serve God and God’s children, practicing Karma Yoga, then you can lead a truly successful life,” Gabbard said. “Success is not defined by temporary material things, trinkets, glittery objects or accomplishments - but a deeply successful and happy life centered around service,” she added. The Iraq war veteran ended her presidential campaign in March and offered her full support to former vice president Joe Biden, 77, who is all set to challenge Republican incumbent Donald Trump, 73, in November elections. The commencement address focused heavily on themes from the Bhagavad Gita, a timeless historical text that many Hindus consider their moral framework. Professor Kak, Regent Professor at Oklahoma State University and 2019 Padma Shri recipient, read out the names of the graduating students. “I exhort you - the graduating students - to be the leaders of the new world where education is less of the mind of a vessel to be filled with information (usually forgotten after the semester is over), and more of a flame that is lit as envisioned by our Vedic sages,” he said. The student speakers were from many university campuses, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton and Stanford. The programme included offerings of Hindu prayers, recitation of a traditional graduation message from the Upanishads and a symbolic conferral of degrees to high school and college graduate. Founded in 1990, Hindu Students Council is North America’s largest pan-Hindu youth organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-this-chaotic-time-find-strength-and-peace-in-bhagavad-gita-tulsi-gabbard/story-FocgWtD3vprQyCgVmVtRGL.html

The findings also showed that one dose may provide protection against the novel coronavirus. Prior studies on a vaccine for SARS - a close cousin to the new virus that causes Covid-19 - suggests vaccines against this type of virus might have the unintended effect of causing more severe disease when the vaccinated person is later exposed to the pathogen, especially in individuals who do not produce an adequately strong immune response. Scientists have seen this risk as a hurdle to clear before vaccines can be safely tested in thousands of healthy people.Also read: ‘Covid-19 virus may have mutated to become more infectious and stable’ - StudyWhile the data released by the US National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and Moderna offered some assurance, the studies do not fully answer the question.“This is the barest beginning of preliminary information,” said Dr. Gregory Poland, an immunologist and vaccine researcher at the Mayo Clinic who has seen the paper, which has yet to undergo peer-review.Poland said the paper was incomplete, disorganized and the numbers of animals tested were small.The authors said they have submitted the work to a top-tier journal. Moderna’s vaccine is in midstage testing in healthy volunteers. Moderna said on Thursday it plans to begin final-stage trials enrolling 30,000 people in July.In the animal studies, mice received one or two shots of a variety of doses of Moderna’s vaccine, including doses considered not strong enough to elicit a protective immune response. Researchers then exposed the mice to the virus.Subsequent analyses suggest “sub-protective” immune responses do not cause what is known as vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease, a susceptibility to more severe disease in the lungs.“Subprotective doses did not prime mice for enhanced immunopathology following (exposure),” Dr. Barney Graham of the Vaccine Research Center at NIAID and colleagues wrote in the manuscript, posted on the bioRxiv website.Further testing suggested the vaccine induces antibody responses to block the virus from infecting cells. The vaccine also appeared to protect against infection by the coronavirus in the lungs and noses without evidence of toxic effects, the team wrote.They noted the mice that received just one dose before exposure to the virus seven weeks later were “completely protected against lung viral replication,” suggesting a single vaccination prevented the virus from replicating in the lungs. “At first glance, it looks promising in inducing neutralizing antibody protection in mice,” Dr. Peter Hotez, a researcher at Baylor College of Medicine said in an email. He had not reviewed the paper in detail.Poland, who was not involved with the research, said the paper leaves out “important parameters” that could help scientists judge the work.“The results, such as they are presented, provide interesting data that are reassuring ...

As restrictions on economic activity are lifted, the United States was bound to see increased infections, Anthony Fauci told CNN. “But when you start seeing more hospitalizations, that’s a sure fire sign that you’re in a situation where you’re going in the wrong direction,” Fauci said. So far, more than 114,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the United States, according to a Reuters tally. About half a dozen US states are grappling with a rising number of coronavirus patients filling hospital beds. Texas and North Carolina on Friday reported their highest hospitalization rates since the pandemic began. But officials in both states point out they also have among the lowest rates of deaths from COVID-19.Fauci underscored that increased hospitalizations was a worrying trend, however, and a sign that “maybe we need to slow down a little” on reopenings. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said on Friday that while his state’s rise in hospitalizations and new cases was sobering, moving ahead with more reopenings was not off the table. Texas has been at the forefront of states’ efforts to reopen their economies and Governor Greg Abbott on Friday said in an interview with KYTX TV it would remain that way “because we have so many hospital beds available to anybody who gets ill.” “For every person in a hospital bed, there are 10 open, available hospital beds available for them,” Abbott said. “So there’s plenty of hospital capacity to be able to deal with Covid-19.”He added that there is “no real need to ratchet back the opening of businesses in the state.”A handful of states and cities have paused or slowed reopenings.Oregon Governor Kate Brown said she would put county applications to reopen on hold after the state reported a record daily rise in new coronavirus cases on Thursday.“This is essentially a statewide ‘yellow light,’ it’s time to press pause for one week before any further reopening,” Brown, a Democrat, said in a statement.Utah’s Republican Governor Gary Herbert on Friday ordered most of the state to halt reopening while it investigated a jump in cases.“I don’t want to go forward and then take a step backward,” Herbert said of the order that remains in effect until June 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/slight-covid-19-spikes-may-get-out-of-control-amid-us-reopening-says-fauci/story-dMCFGJGxltrL4WZ5M7YqDN.html

National carrier Air India on Friday evening operated its first passenger flight ever from the Finnish capital city Helsinki, bringing back the Indian citizens stranded in the four European countries due to the international travel restrictions following the coronavirus outbreak.Air India’s Country Manager in Israel, Pankaj Tiwari, whose office coordinated the repatriation flight told PTI that the AI 1184 flight landed in New Delhi on Saturday.“The repatriation provided immense relief to stranded Indians, especially those who had come to Finland as tourists, business travellers, senior citizens who had been visiting their children and students who finished their academic year,” India’s Ambassador to Finland Vani Rao told PTI.“Among them were a couple who came to Finland for their honeymoon and got stuck for three months. Several are returning to India for medical attention and family emergencies,” Rao added. While most of the stranded passengers were from Finland, 15 were from Estonia, some from Denmark and one from Latvia. The Air India flight also brought to Finland 168 people, including 15 infants, who were stranded in India.The special flight was a massive effort and a challenging one because Air India does not have any operations in Finland and all the logistics and ground support had to be handled by the concerned Finnish operators and was managed remotely by the Air India office in Tel Aviv, Rao said. “This operation was very special as it was the first ever passenger flight from Finland to India by Air India. Another first was the scale at which thermal screening was carried out at the Helsinki airport -- in the last 15 years a thermal screening operation of so many passengers was not done in Helsinki on a single day,” she said.The Finnish government, especially the foreign ministry, the border police and the airport management company, Finnavia, extended their cooperation and support to the inbound and outbound flights in coordination with the Indian embassy and the Air India office in Tel Aviv.The Indian community in Finland also came forward to volunteer in the efforts.“While the mission was extremely challenging and needed coordination on several fronts, the happiness of the stranded Indians and their relief at finally heading back home made it completely worthwhile. For the embassy and the Indian community, an Air India flight landing at Helsinki was a moment of pride and a very memorable one,” Rao said.Some Indians in Finland and Estonia who could not be accommodated on the flight, and are keen to go back to India, have been advised to take the Vande Bharat Flights from Frankfurt and Paris through direct booking. “Handling operations at an offline location is challenging, but with the excellent support from the team of Embassy officials, local authorities in Finland and the Air India Team it was a seamless experience,” Tiwari said.The third phase of the Vande Bharat Mission got underway on Thursday and will continue till July 2. Phase-III will have 432 international flights from 43 countries reaching 17 states and union territories. A total of 1,65,375 Indians have returned from abroad till Thursday under the evacuation mission, the first phase of which was launched on May 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-repatriates-227-stranded-citizens-from-finland-denmark-estonia-and-latvia/story-ZgXwvQ6S3vdEWPZ4ndSEOJ.html
13-06-2020||World||Up to 45% of Covid-19 infections may be asymptomatic: Study||As much as 45 per cent of people infected by the novel coronavirus behind the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic never show symptoms of the disease, according to a review of studies which suggests that the virus may silently damage the bodies of these asymptotic individuals. Scientists, including Eric Topol from the Scripps Research Translational Institute in the US, analysed public datasets on asymptomatic infections of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The findings, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, suggested that asymptomatic people may account for approximately 40 to 45 per cent of SARS-CoV-2 infections, playing a significant role in the spread of the disease. Based on the study, the scientists highlighted the need for expansive testing and contact tracing of infected individuals to mitigate the pandemic. “The silent spread of the virus makes it all the more challenging to control,” said Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute and professor of Molecular Medicine at Scripps Research. “Our review really highlights the importance of testing. It’s clear that with such a high asymptomatic rate, we need to cast a very wide net, otherwise the virus will continue to evade us,” he added. In the study, Topol and his team collected information from testing studies on 16 diverse cohorts from around the world. The scientists noted in a statement that these datasets were gathered via keyword searches of PubMed, bioRxiv and medRxiv, as well as Google searches of relevant news reports. They said the analysis included data on nursing home residents, cruise ship passengers, prison inmates and various other groups. “What virtually all of them had in common was that a very large proportion of infected individuals had no symptoms,” said Daniel Oran, another co-author of the study. “Among more than 3,000 prison inmates in four states who tested positive for the coronavirus, the figure was astronomical -- 96 percent asymptomatic,” Oran said. According to the review research, asymptomatic individuals are able to transmit the virus for an extended period of time, perhaps longer than 14 days. The scientists noted that the viral loads are very similar in people with or without symptoms, but it remains unclear whether their infectiousness is of the same magnitude. To resolve that issue, they said, large-scale studies that include sufficient numbers of asymptomatic people are needed. The absence of symptoms may not imply an absence of harm, the researchers concluded. Citing an example, they said CT scans conducted on asymptomatic individuals on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, appeared to show significant lung abnormalities, raising the possibility of the virus silently impacting lung function. “Although the latter infected persons reported no symptoms, some actually had subclinical changes in their lungs. When computed tomography scans for 76 of these persons were examined, 54 per cent showed lung opacities,” the researchers wrote in the study. The scientists believe that further research is needed to confirm the potential significance of this finding. They said the lack of longitudinal data makes distinguishing between asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals difficult. An asymptomatic individual, the researchers said, is someone who is infected with SARS-CoV-2, but never develops symptoms of Covid-19, while a presymptomatic person is similarly infected, but will eventually develop symptoms. According to the scientists, longitudinal testing, which refers to repeated testing of individuals over time, would help differentiate between the two.“Our estimate of 40 to 45 percent asymptomatic means that, if you’re unlucky enough to get infected, the probability is almost a flip of a coin on whether you’re going to have symptoms,” Oran said. “So to protect others, we think that wearing a mask makes a lot of sense,” he concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/up-to-45-of-covid-19-infections-may-be-asymptomatic-study/story-TxRqU6PTBh6I6ivqecQdSJ.html
13-06-2020||World||In Covid-19 cases, around 45% of people never showed symptoms, suggests study||Asymptomatic patients may account for as much as 45 per cent of all Covid-19 cases, playing a significant role in the early and ongoing spread of the novel coronavirus, according to a new research. The study, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, suggests that an extraordinary percentage of people infected by the ongoing deadly Covid-19 pandemic never showed symptoms of the disease.The report highlights the need for expansive testing and contacts tracing to mitigate the pandemic.“The silent spread of the virus makes it all the more challenging to control,” said study researcher Eric Topol from the Scripps Research Translational Institute in the US.“Our review really highlights the importance of testing. It’s clear that with such a high asymptomatic rate, we need to cast a very wide net, otherwise the virus will continue to evade us,” Topol added.For the results, the research team collected information from testing studies on 16 diverse cohorts from around the world.These datasets -- gathered via keyword searches of non peer-reviewed research portals PubMed, bioRxiv and medRxiv, as well as Google searches of relevant news reports -- included data on nursing home residents, cruise ship passengers, prison inmates and various other groups.What virtually all of them had in common was that a very large proportion of infected individuals had no symptoms, the researchers said.Among more than 3,000 prison inmates in four states who tested positive for the coronavirus, the figure was astronomical: 96 per cent asymptomatic, according to the study.The review further suggests that asymptomatic individuals are able to transmit the virus for an extended period of time, perhaps longer than 14 days.The viral loads are very similar in people with or without symptoms, but it remains unclear whether their infectiousness is of the same magnitude.To resolve that issue, we’ll need large-scale studies that include sufficient numbers of asymptomatic people.The authors also conclude that the absence of symptoms may not imply an absence of harm.CT scans conducted on 54 per cent of 76 asymptomatic individuals on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, appear to show significant subclinical lung abnormalities raising the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection impacting lung function that might not be immediately apparent.The scientists said that further research is needed to confirm the potential significance of this finding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/up-to-45-of-coronavirus-infections-may-be-asymptomatic-study/story-e7zVoAGDycLqAw2QqUIvxI.html
13-06-2020||World||Nepal Parliament set to vote on new map which covers Indian territory||Nepal Parliament’s special session began on Saturday to discuss a key Constitution amendment bill tabled by the government to revise the country’s political map, laying claim over the strategically key areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura along the border with India.The House of Representatives opened the discussion on the amendment bill which will be put for voting after the deliberations are over, said spokesman at the Parliament Rojnath Pandey.He said the House has been working to put the bill to vote on Saturday.Endorsement of the bill is certain as the Opposition Nepali Congress and Janata Samajwadi Party-Nepal have vowed to back for the government bill to amend Schedule 3 of the constitution to update the national emblem by incorporating the new map, sources said. The bill will be endorsed through a consensus, a senior minister told PTI.Two-thirds majority of the 275-member Lower House is required to pass the bill. Once the bill is passed by the Lower House, it will be sent to the National Assembly where it will undergo a similar process. The NA will have to give lawmakers 72 hours to move amendments against the bill’s provisions, if any. After the National Assembly passes the bill, it will be submitted to the President for authentication, after which the bill will be incorporated in the Constitution. On June 9, the Parliament unanimously endorsed a proposal to consider the bill to pave way for endorsing the new map. The government on Wednesday formed a nine-member team of experts to collect historical facts and evidence related to the area. Diplomats and experts, however, questioned the government’s move, asking why the task force was formed when the map has already been released and approved by the Cabinet. The ties between India and Nepal came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8. Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory. Nepal last month released the revised political and administrative map of the country laying claim over the strategically key areas. India has been maintaining that these three areas belonged to it. India sternly asked Nepal not to resort to any “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims after Kathmandu released the new map. Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli earlier this month said that his government will seek a solution to the Kalapani issue through diplomatic efforts and dialogue on the basis of historical facts and documents. “We will get back the land occupied by India through holding a dialogue,” Oli said while responding to questions in Parliament on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-parliament-s-session-begins-likely-to-pass-bill-to-redraw-political-map/story-bBV3pdZaQMIcxma1nN8AHM.html

13-06-2020||World||‘Covid-19 virus may have mutated to become more infectious and stable’: Study||A latest study by experts at the Scripps Research Institute in Florida, US, states that the new coronavirus may have mutated, therefore more infectious. The study which was published by the institute on Friday states, “Covid-19-causing viral variant taking over in the United States and Europe now carries more functional, cell-binding spikes.”Laboratory experiments performed at the institute revealed that a tiny genetic mutation in the SARS coronavirus 2 variant circulating throughout Europe and the United States significantly increases the virus’ ability to infect cells.“Viruses with this mutation were much more infectious than those without the mutation in the cell culture system we used,” Scripps Research virologist Hyeryun Choe, PhD and senior author of the study said.ALSO WATCH | AIIMS director explains why Covid deaths are more important than casesAlso read: Existing polio vaccine shows promise, could protect against Covid-19’There has been much debate about why Covid-19 outbreaks in some parts of the world quickly overwhelmed health systems, while at other locations the outbreak could be readily managed.“Was it something about those communities and their response, or had the virus somehow changed?” The study explained how all viruses mutate and change to some degree but those changes “rarely impact fitness or ability to compete”. The significant change with respect to SARS-CoV-2 variant was the presence of D614G mutation which was absent in the earliest regional outbreaks. Also read: Top 2 coronavirus-hit countries are nearly 12 lakh cases apartThe experts, however, have called for more research, concluding that the Covid-19 virus may have ultimately figured out how to be more stable and not fall apart. “Over time, it has figured out how to hold on better and not fall apart until it needs to,” co-author Michael Farzan, PhD, co-chairman of the Scripps Research Department of Immunology and Microbiology said. “The virus has, under selection pressure, made itself more stable,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-virus-may-have-mutated-to-beccome-more-infectious-and-stable-study/story-0CBBqU5mTrSoxuyBT0PJUI.html

13-06-2020||World||India’s presence in UNSC will help bring its ethos of ‘world is one family’||India’s presence in the United Nations Security Council will help bring to the world its ethos of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, the country’s envoy to the global body has said, ahead of elections for the non-permanent seat of the powerful UN organ. India is all set to join the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member, elections for which will be held on June 17.India is a candidate for a non-permanent seat from the Asia-Pacific category for the 2021-22 term. Its victory is a given since it is the sole candidate vying for the lone seat from the grouping. New Delhi’s candidature was unanimously endorsed by the 55-member Asia-Pacific grouping, including China and Pakistan, in June last year. India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti, in a video message on Friday, underscored that the United Nations as well as the multilateralism need to change to reflect the contemporary realities and remain credible as the world organisation marks its 75th anniversary this year. “India’s journey with the United Nations is quite a remarkable one. As a founding member of the United Nations, India’s contribution to implementing the goals of the United Nations Charter and to the evolution of UN specialised agencies and programmes has been substantial. In many ways, quite extraordinary,” he said. “I’m confident that at a time when we are poised to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations and later the 75th anniversary of India’s independence in 2022, India’s presence in the Security Council will help bring to the world our ethos that the world is one family - Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,” Tirumurti said. Ahead of the elections, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has outlined New Delhi’s priorities for its candidature. India’s focus will be on the ‘New Orientation For A Reformed Multilateral System’ (NORMS). India’s priorities include new opportunities for progress, effective response to the international terrorism, reforming multilateral systems, comprehensive approach to peace and security and technology with a human touch. Tirumurti said as the UN commemorates its 75th anniversary this year, “it is clear to us that the United Nations and indeed multilateralism itself need to change to reflect the contemporary realities to enable them to remain effective and credible.” The envoy referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a reformed multilateralism and multilateral system as essential to ensure that the international system is inclusive and caters to the requirements of all countries, which will in turn facilitate stronger actions. “We also believe that the current crisis that we face, especially in the context of the Covid-19, provide the seed for new opportunities,” Tirumurti said. Previously, India has been elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the years 1950-1951, 1967-1968, 1972-1973, 1977-1978, 1984-1985, 1991-1992 and most recently in 2011-2012. India has been at the forefront of the years-long efforts to reform the Security Council, saying it rightly deserves a place as a permanent member of the UNSC, which in its current form does not represent the geo-political realities of the 21st century. The video message outlined India’s role and contribution to the UN over the decades, including its leadership role in the UN peacekeeping, launch of the India Human Development Partnership Fund, Modi’s call to commemorate International Yoga Day and India’s gift of the Gandhi Solar Park installed on the roof of the UN headquarters. It also highlighted the pioneering men and women from India whose contribution helped shape the world organisation. They include Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar, the first president of the UN Economic and Social Council ECOSOC in 1946; reformer and educator Hansa Mehta, India’s delegate to the UN Commission on Human Rights from 1947 to 1948, who is widely credited with making a significant change in the language of Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by replacing the phrase “All men are born free and equal” to “All human beings are born free and equal”. Lakshmi Menon was India’s delegate to the Third Committee in 1948 and argued forcefully in the favour of non-discrimination based on sex and Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit who was the first woman to be elected as the President of the General Assembly in 1953. “Independent India deemed its membership of the United Nations as an important guarantee for maintaining peace and security. We stood at the forefront, not just in the United Nations but outside it as well during the years of struggle against colonialism and apartheid,” Tirumurti added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-s-presence-in-unsc-will-help-bring-its-ethos-of-world-is-one-family/story-UujLcBefutSGVMAh6cgZuJ.html
13-06-2020||World||‘Stop nonsensical talks about denuclearization’: North Korea slams neighbour||North Korea on Saturday again bashed South Korea, telling its rival to stop “nonsensical” talk about its denuclearization and vowing to expand its military capabilities.The statement by senior North Korean Foreign Ministry official Kwon Jong Gun came after South Korea’s Foreign Ministry told reporters that Seoul will continue to work toward improving bilateral relations and reviving nuclear negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington.The government of South Korean President Moon Jae-in had lobbied hard to set up nuclear summits between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump, who have met three times since 2018. At the same time, Moon also worked to improve inter-Korean relations.But North Korea in recent months has suspended virtually all cooperation with the South while expressing frustration over the lack of progress in its nuclear negotiations with the Trump administration.The North over the past week declared it will cut off all government and military communication channels with the South and threatened to abandon inter-Korean peace agreements reached in 2018. It blamed Seoul for failing to stop activists from floating anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border.Seoul’s Foreign Ministry was reacting to a separate North Korean statement late Friday that said the North’s confidence with the South’s government was completely “shattered” and that “regretful and painful times” were ahead for its rival.Kwon, director-general of the Foreign Ministry’s U.S. affairs department, said it was “preposterous to hear the balderdash of (South Korean) authorities, who do not have either any qualification to discuss, or the position to poke their noses into” matters between North Korea and the United States, including nuclear issues. He dismissed South Korea’s role as a mediator between Washington and Pyongyang.“I want to make it clear that we will continue to build up our force in order to overpower the persistent threats from the United States, and such efforts of ours are in fact continuing at this point of time,” Kwon said in a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.“We are not what we were two years ago. The change continues and will continue as ever in a tremendous way. It is better to stop a nonsensical talking about denuclearization.”Nuclear talks faltered after the United States rejected North Korean demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of the North’s nuclear capabilities at Kim’s second summit with Trump in Vietnam in February last year.Trump and Kim met for a third time that year in June at the border between North and South Korea and agreed to resume talks. But an October working-level meeting in Sweden broke down over what the North Koreans described as the Americans’ “old stance and attitude.”On the two-year anniversary of the first Kim-Trump meeting on Friday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Son Gwon said the North would never again gift Trump with high-profile meetings he could boast as foreign policy achievements unless it gets something substantial in return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stop-nonsensical-talks-about-denuclearization-north-korea-slams-neighbour/story-DDOA38ZWLn9HsKMcEOV69O.html
13-06-2020||World||Trump shifts date of Oklahoma rally to ‘respect’ emancipation holiday||US President Donald Trump said on Friday he would shift the date of an Oklahoma rally from June 19th, the date of the “Juneteenth” holiday, to June 20th out of respect for a day commemorating the end of US slavery.Amid protests against racial injustice, Trump had faced criticism for scheduling his first campaign rally in months on a day known by African Americans as Freedom Day and in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a city where white mobs massacred African-Americans a century ago.“Many of my African American friends and supporters have reached out to suggest that we consider changing the date out of respect for this Holiday,” Trump tweeted. “I have therefore decided to move our rally to Saturday, June 20th, in order to honor their requests.”Trump, seeking re-election on Nov. 3, scheduled the Tulsa rally on June 19th, the date in 1865 when Texas became the last of the pro-slavery Confederate states forced to comply with President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation during the Civil War declaring all people held as slaves free.Tulsa, a city important in African-American history, in 1921 was the site of one of the bloodiest outbreaks of racist violence in US history in which white mobs attacked black residents and businesses. Referring to his rally, Trump told Fox News in an interview aired earlier on Friday: “Think about it as a celebration.” The Republican president suspended his political rallies in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. Trump denied that scheduling the Tulsa rally on Juneteenth was deliberate. The rally will take place against a backdrop of protests around the United States against racism and police brutality sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25 after a white officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The officer was fired and has been charged with second-degree murder.Fox News interviewer Harris Faulkner, who is black, later said she was not sure whether Trump was aware of the painful history of Tulsa for African-Americans because her questions in the interview, held on Thursday, focused on the Juneteenth date of the rally.“This isn’t just a wink to white supremacists - he’s throwing them a welcome home party,” US Senator Kamala Harris, a contender to be Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s vice presidential pick, wrote on Twitter on Thursday.Trump, who this week rejected calls to rename US military bases named for Confederate military figures, said in the Fox News interview that what Lincoln had done was “questionable,” but was cut off before he could elaborate.“I think I’ve done more for the black community than any other president. And let’s take a pass on Abraham Lincoln ‘cause he did good, although it’s always questionable. You know, in other words the end result,” Trump said without explanation.Faulkner then spoke over him saying: “But we are free, Mr. President. He did pretty well.”“We are free. You understand what I mean. I’m going to take a pass on Abe - Honest Abe as we call him,” Trump responded.Democrats and other critics have accused Trump of stoking racial divisions. The president said during the Floyd protests in which looting occurred in some cities that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Trump told Fox News he was not aware that this phrase originated with a white segregationist who was Miami mayor in the 1960s.On Thursday, the Republican Party scheduled Trump’s speech to formally accept its presidential nomination for Aug. 27 in Jacksonville, Florida. That day will mark the 60th anniversary of what is called “Ax Handle Saturday,” when a white mob wielding ax handles began a riot over black youth attempting to order food from a whites-only lunch counter in Jacksonville.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-shifts-date-of-oklahoma-rally-to-respect-emancipation-holiday/story-NsqBnl80ss58vp0XhSK0yJ.html
13-06-2020||World||Pakistan forms joint investigation team to probe PIA plane crash||The Pakistan government has formed a joint investigation team to probe the last month’s plane crash in Karachi that killed 98 people.The joint investigation team (JIT) was constituted on Friday, comprising officials of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), to probe into the Pakistan International Ailrlines (PIA) plane crash. “The three-member JIT headed by FIA Immigration Lahore Additional Director Imran Yaqoob, is tasked to finalise the matter on top priority and submit the report to the government at the earliest,” an FIA official told PTI. The official said the JIT has been constituted in compliance with the Senate Committee on Interior that had taken notice of the plane crash and asked the government to constitute a high-power committee.A four-member team of the Aircraft Accident and Investigation Board (AAIB) led by Air Commodore Muhammad Usman Ghani has already been investigating the crash.Besides, a French team also visited Pakistan to conduct an independent probe and collected evidence from the crash site as well as inspected the runway.The Pakistan government has said it will make the preliminary report of the AAIB team public on June 22.The PIA plane, with 99 people on board, crashed in the Model Colony near Jinnah International Airport in Karachi on May 22, killing 97 people. Two passengers miraculously survived.A 13-year-old girl who was injured on the ground later succumbed to her injuries, taking the death toll in the incident to 98.The Senate Committee had recommended that the FIA Lahore should examine if the engineering branch of PIA at Lahore was being maintained as per the given international standards and how many times the small components of aircraft had been made/repaired from local companies /workshops.The Committee said it was felt that the maintenance system of aircraft had been deteriorating day by day and becoming irresponsible which was visibly noted over the past few tragic incidents. “All aircraft of PIA should be retested, overhauled and the maintenance must be done by PIA and the certificates with responsibility be given before bringing the aircraft on the runway to avoid such incidents in future, following internationally acknowledged air safety rules to make Pakistani airspace safest for flying,” it said.It also called for detailed record of the maintenance of the crashed aircraft, an Airbus A-320.“It is reported that error was being shown on the cockpit of the plane. Who was the authorised officer to sign the clearance certificate of the said plane? Was the clearance certificate also signed by the Captain? This plane remained under dry lease to China and what was its condition when this plane was received back from China?” the Senate Committee on Interior questioned.It further said that Capitan Sajjad Gul made three Mayday calls requesting the ground staff that there was an error in the plane but his three emergency calls for emergency response could not convince the ground staff to response on his first call. “Who was the staff member on the ground who declared the said emergency call as light one?” It said that one could visibly see that both engines of the plane were on fire. While the plane successfully reached Karachi, the shutting of both engines of the plane was reported by the pilot. If the engines were shut, how did the engines catch fire? The committee questioned that if the captain had shown the apprehension that both engines were shut and landing gear was stuck then why he was not allowed immediately on his first call with belly landing if the belly-landing facility was available at Karachi Airport?

13-06-2020||World||Five dead in latest flooding in southern China rainstorms||Rainstorms have killed five more people in a southern Chinese region already reeling from heavy flooding over the past week.The government of Zunyi city, south of the metropolis of Chongqing, said Saturday that five had died and eight others were missing after fresh storms that began late Thursday night.A statement on its website said at least 13,000 people had been evacuated, more than 2,000 homes damaged and multiple sections of roads and three bridges destroyed in the city in Guizhou province.Earlier storms left 13 dead in nearby Hunan province and the Guangxi region.Seasonal flooding regularly strikes the lower regions of China’s major river systems, particularly those of the Yangtze and the Pearl to the south.More than 200,000 people have been forced to seek shelter and economic losses are estimated at more than $500 million, the Ministry of Emergency Management said earlier this week.Guangxi’s crucial tourism sector, already hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, has been set back further by the floods. The region is home to the city of Guilin, famous for its landscape of karst rock formations.Authorities have sought to mitigate flooding through the construction of dams, such as the massive Three Gorges structure on the Yangtze.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-dead-in-latest-flooding-in-southern-china-rainstorms/story-Gtk8HWXGLdeiRAiskkyBmJ.html
13-06-2020||World||Judge orders Seattle to stop using tear gas during protests||A US judge on Friday ordered Seattle police to temporarily halt using tear gas, pepper spray and flash-bang devices to break up peaceful protests. The city, long known as liberal with a lengthy history of protests, has been taking hits from all sides including protesters, some city officials, the president and now a judge over police response to recent demonstrations.US District Judge Richard Jones issued the two-week order after a Black Lives Matter group sued the Seattle Police Department this week to halt the violent tactics it has used to break up protests.Officers last weekend used tear gas, pepper spray and other force against crowds that were demonstrating following George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police.Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan and Police Chief Carmen Best have apologized to peaceful protesters who were subjected to chemical weapons. But Best has said some demonstrators violently targeted police, throwing objects and ignoring orders to disperse. Both have faced calls to resign, which they have rejected.The judge said those objecting to police using violent tactics to break up protests make a strong case that the indiscriminate use of force is unconstitutional. Jones said weapons like tear gas and pepper spray fail to target “any single agitator or criminal” and they are especially problematic during the coronavirus pandemic.“Because they are indiscriminate, they may even spill into bystanders’ homes or offices as they have done before,” Jones wrote.Durkan, a former US attorney, “believes the court struck the right balance to protect the fundamental constitutional right to exercise protest, with the need to also ensure public safety,” spokesperson Kamaria Hightower said in an email.Durkan also has requested reviews of police actions from the Office of Police Accountability and the city’s inspector general.This week, protesters have turned part of Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood into a protest center with speakers, drum circles and Black Lives Matter painted on a street near a police station. Police largely left the station after the chaos last weekend, with officers tear-gassing protesters and some demonstrators throwing objects at them. Police used tear gas just two days after the mayor and police chief said they were temporarily halting its use.Durkan tweeted that she visited the so-called autonomous zone, which has been criticized by President Donald Trump, to speak Friday with organizers about moving forward. She said that for as long as she can remember, Capitol Hill has been a place where people can go to express themselves.Trump has slammed her and Gov. Jay Inslee for not breaking up the occupation by “anarchists” and threatening to take action if they don’t. Both have assailed his comments and say they’re focusing on a peaceful resolution. The demonstrations since police left the area have been calm.Michele Storms, executive director of the ACLU of Washington, said the group was pleased with the judge’s ruling.“The city must allow for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, and it must address police accountability and excessive use of force,” Storms said in a statement.The ruling came as massive crowds marched in the rain and some businesses temporarily closed in response to a call from Black Lives Matter Seattle-King County to launch a statewide general strike.“As tens of thousands of people were gathering today to march silently and in solidarity against police brutality and misconduct, the US District Court affirmed their right to protest, free from state violence. That is a victory for today,” the group said in a statement.Durkan tweeted Friday afternoon that she and Best participated in the Black Lives Matter march, saying Best and her police department leaders have been working “incredibly hard to adjust and improve every day.”Black Lives Matter had encouraged supporters not go to work or to work from home Friday and to take time to learn about local elected officials and issues. Organizers have demands for the city, county and state, including cutting at least $100 million from the Seattle police budget, ending cash bail and declaring racism a public health crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-orders-seattle-to-stop-using-tear-gas-during-protests/story-nF8rV5UkAiCldxmzYqHtJP.html

The containers will be delivered to several cemeteries within 15 days, the statement said.Sao Paulo is one of the Covid-19 hot spots in Latin America’s hardest-hit nation, with 5,480 deaths as of Thursday in the city of 12 million people. And some health experts are worried about a new surge now that a decline in intensive care bed occupancy to about 70% prompted Mayor Bruno Covas to authorize a partial reopening of business this week. The result has been crowded public transport, long lines at malls and widespread disregard for social distancing.Many health experts predict the peak of Brazil’s pandemic will arrive in August, having spread from the big cities where it first appeared into the nation’s interior. The virus has so far killed almost 42,000 Brazilians, and Brazil passed the United Kingdom on Friday to become the country with the world’s second highest death toll.Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization’s emergencies chief, said Friday that the situation in Brazil remains “of concern,” although acknowledged that intensive care bed occupancy rates are now below 80% in most areas of the country.“Overall the health system is still coping in Brazil, although, having said that, with the sustained number of severe cases that remains to be seen,” Ryan said. “Clearly the health system in Brazil across the country needs significant support in order to sustain its effort in this regard. But the data we have at the moment supports a system under pressure, but a system still coping with the number of severe cases.”The experts aren’t the only ones with concerns.At Sao Paulo’s biggest cemetery, Vila Formosa, Adenilson Costa was among workers in blue protective suits digging up old graves Friday. He said their work has only grown more arduous during the pandemic, and as he removed bones from unearthed coffins, he said he fears what is to come.“With this opening of malls and stores we get even more worried. We are not in the curve; we are in the peak and people aren’t aware,” Costa said. “This isn’t over. Now is the worrisome moment. And there are still people out.”In April, gravediggers at Vila Formosa buried 1,654 people, up more than 500 from the previous month. Numbers for May and June aren’t yet available.Before the pandemic, Costa said, he and colleagues would exhume remains of about 40 coffins per day if families stopped paying required fees for the plots. In recent weeks that figure has more than doubled.Remains stored in the metal containers will eventually be moved to a public ossuary, according to the statement from the city’s funeral office. Its superintendent, Thiago Dias da Silva, told the Globo network that containers have been used before and they are more practical and affordable than building new ossuaries.Work has been so busy in Sao Paulo cemeteries since the outbreak began that one of Costa’s relatives was buried only a few meters (yards) from where he was working one day — without him even knowing. “I only found out the next day,” he said.Three other people he knew have also died from the virus.“People say nothing scares gravediggers. Covid does,” Costa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-s-biggest-cemetery-to-exhume-graves-to-free-up-space/story-FoyZZP32mucrgY6qjpHHbN.html
13-06-2020||World||Masks may have prevented thousands of Covid-19 cases: Study||Requiring the wearing of masks to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus in areas at the epicenter of the global pandemic may have prevented tens of thousands of infections, a new study suggests.Mask-wearing is even more important for preventing the virus’ spread and the sometimes deadly Covid-19 illness it causes than social distancing and stay-at-home orders, researchers said, in the study published in PNAS: The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageInfection trends shifted dramatically when mask-wearing rules were implemented on April 6 in northern Italy and April 17 in New York City - at the time among the hardest hit areas of the world by the health crisis - the study found. “This protective measure alone significantly reduced the number of infections, that is, by over 78,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and over 66,000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9,” researchers calculated.When mask-wearing went into effect in New York, the daily new infection rate fell by about 3% per day, researchers said. In the rest of the country, daily new infections continued to increase. Direct contact precautions - social distancing, quarantine and isolation, and hand sanitizing - were all in place before mask-wearing rules went into effect in Italy and New York City. But they only help minimize virus transmission by direct contact, while face covering helps prevent airborne transmission, the researchers say. “The unique function of face covering to block atomization and inhalation of virus-bearing aerosols accounts for the significantly reduced infections,” they said. That would indicate “that airborne transmission of Covid-19 represents the dominant route for infection.”The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday urged organizers of large gatherings that involve “shouting, chanting or singing to strongly encourage the use of cloth face coverings to lower the risk of spreading the coronavirus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/masks-may-have-prevented-thousands-of-covid-19-cases-study/story-tZshTixGLQppamRNF480RJ.html

People with mild symptoms or no obvious symptoms can unknowingly pass the infection on to other people,” NSW Health said.Two of the four new cases were travellers who are already in hotel quarantine, while one was linked to a previously reported infection at a public school.Australia has so far been successful in curbing the spread of the coronavirus, with many parts of the country claiming to have eliminated the disease already. The country has reported 102 deaths and is on track to fully re-open its economy by next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-largest-state-reports-first-local-coronavirus-case-in-weeks/story-4gZm62EonDuvffn4HJ17CP.html
13-06-2020||World||China sentences Australian to death for drug trafficking||An Australian national has been sentenced to death by a Chinese court for drug trafficking, a verdict that could further inflame tensions between Beijing and Canberra.Already troubled relations worsened recently after China reacted furiously to Australia’s call for an independent probe into the origins of the deadly coronavirus pandemic.The person, named in Chinese pinyin as “Kamu Jielaisibi”, was handed the death penalty by Guangzhou Intermediate People’s Court on Wednesday, according to a notice posted on the court website that day.The notice revealed no details about the defendant besides their Australian nationality.China is Australia’s largest trading partner, as well as a major source of lucrative international students and tourists.In an apparent response to the coronavirus probe demand, Beijing imposed tariffs on Australian barley, and issued travel warnings to tourists and students over virus-linked racism against ethnic Asians.Prime Minister Scott Morrison has dismissed allegations of racist treatment of Chinese as “rubbish”, adding that his government would “never be intimidated by threats” or “trade our values in response to coercion from wherever it comes”.Last year, separately, China sentenced two Canadian nationals to death on drug trafficking charges during an escalating diplomatic row with Canada over the arrest of top Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.Canadian attempts to plead for clemency for Robert Schellenberg and Fan Wei have so far not been successful.China has additionally detained two Canadian nationals, including a former diplomat, on spying charges, widely believed to be in retaliation for Meng’s arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sentences-australian-to-death-for-drug-trafficking/story-nHrkEg05GJo11owVfUJEOI.html

The Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Wisconsin in August would formally nominate Biden, 77, as the party’s candidate for the November 3 presidential elections.In the presidential elections, Biden will challenge Republican incumbent Donald Trump, 73, who is seeking re-election. On the National Finance Committee for the former vice president, Bhutoria is a prominent national bundler for the Democratic Party. He was elected as a Biden Delegate for the California District 17th National Convention District-Level Caucus this week. The election was held through online ballot. As a strong supporter of Biden, Bhutoria has been instrumental in bringing together the issues of Asian Americans to forefront. He is working with the DNC to have the Democratic Party website translated into Asian American languages. Also on Asian American Pacific Islander Leadership Council for Biden, Bhutoria is bringing together the Asian Americans to vote for him, primarily South Asians. He worked on the National Finance committee for Hillary Clinton’s election in 2016, raising between USD 500 to USD 1 million. Bhutoria has also worked with the Obama-Biden administration on many issues, including free community college initiative around the country.

13-06-2020||World||Police video of aboriginal chief arrest shocking, says Canadian PM Trudeau||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that black and indigenous people in Canada do not feel safe around police after a police dashcam video emerged of the violent arrest of a Canadian aboriginal chief.The arrest has received attention in Canada as a backlash against racism grows worldwide in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee to his neck.The 12-minute police video shows an officer charging at Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation Chief Allan Adam with his arm and elbow up as he tackles him to the ground. It also shows the officer punching him in the head.Trudeau called the video “shocking.” “I have serious questions about what happened,” Trudeau said. “The independent investigation must be transparent and be carried out so that we get answers.At the same time, though, we also know that this is not an isolated incident. Far too many black Canadians and indigenous people do not feel safe around police.It’s unacceptable. And as governments, we have to change that.” Pictures show Adam was left bloodied with his face swollen. Alberta’s police watchdog agency is investigating. Police charged Adam with resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer.The Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation said the Royal Canadian Mounted Police dash camera video was released publicly as part of a court application to get criminal charges against Adam removed.The video earlier shows a different officer approaching Adam’s truck outside a casino in Fort McMurray, Alberta, early on the morning of March 10. Police have said Adam’s truck had expired plates.The video shows Adam getting in and out of the vehicle, removing his coat and taking a karate-like stance and using expletives as he complains about being harassed by police. His wife and niece get in between him and the officer at times.Adam’s lawyer, Brian Beresh, has filed a court motion to have criminal charges dropped over violation of Adam’s constitutional rights.“All of this resulted from an expired license plate tag. The video speaks for itself,” Beresh said in a statement.Opposition Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said he was troubled by the video.“It’s very difficult to watch,” Scheer said. “I found it very troubling and very worrying. The events of the last few days and weeks have ignited a very important conversation about the use of excessive force.” The RCMP said in a statement that the dashcam video had been reviewed by supervisors and “it was determined that the members’ actions were reasonable and did not meet the threshold for an external investigation.” Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said she found the images in the video “incredibly disturbing.” “This is a moment in our country when we need to confront the really horrible reality that systemic racism exists here in Canada, anti-black racism exists in Canada, anti-indigenous racism exists in Canada. It is systemic,” she said.The statement from the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation called for the officers involved to be punished and criminal charges brought.Mark Mendelson, a former Toronto police detective, said the officer flying at Adam with his elbow and punching him on the ground was unnecessary and egregious. Mendelson also wondered why he was being arrested.“You can see him being verbally aggressive. My position is that if you can’t take somebody yelling and swearing and screaming at you, then you probably shouldn’t be a cop,” he said.Adam held a news conference last weekend to talk about excessive force and racism. He has noted that although aboriginal people represent 5% of Canada’s population, they make up to 30% of the prison population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-video-of-aboriginal-chief-arrest-shocking-says-canadian-pm-trudeau/story-wiiTX853R7jxNFTrFsngjM.html
13-06-2020||World||June 21 to be celebrated as International Day of Yoga in Vancouver||Vancouver, one of the largest cities in Canada, has proclaimed June 21 as International Day of Yoga. The annual celebration of the ancient Indian holistic practice will take place online in Canada this year, as restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic remain in place throughout the country.The Vancouver proclamation was followed from Burnaby , a city in British Columbia. Vancouver’s Mayor Kennedy Stewart signed the proclamation which noted that “Yoga has become an integral path to health and wellness in the city of Vancouver.” It also stated that “The city of Vancouver is home to a large and diverse Indo-Canadian community, that has contributed significantly to the economic, social and cultural fabric of the city.”India’s High Commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria welcomed the Vancouver proclamation, tweeting, “Thank you for embracing yoga!”The 5,000-year-old Indian tradition was recognised by the United Nations General Assembly in December 2014 as it declared June 21 as International Day of Yoga.Since then, this day has been marked in several cities across Canada with large gatherings of practitioners and enthusiasts, including events at the Niagara Falls. The Coronavirus pandemic, however, has prevented such physical gatherings. To celebrate the sixth anniversary of the International Yoga Day, the Indian High Commission, along with the consulates in Toronto and Vancouver has put together a series of sessions on social media, as part of its Yoga from Home programming.In keeping with the time in which these activities are occurring, among the sessions is one on yoga in management of Covid-19, as well as related sessions on boosting immunity and improving respiratory health. Among the organisations collaborating in the programmes are Patanjali Yoga Canada, Art of Living Canada, Brahmakumaris and Isha Yoga.The High Commission has organised a My Life My Yoga video blogging competition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/june-21-to-be-celebrated-as-international-day-of-yoga-in-vancouver/story-0ckyz9GUwEnL5oiCZ8560L.html
13-06-2020||World||Coronavirus hitting the Americas hardest says WHO||The Americas are bearing the brunt of the global coronavirus pandemic at present, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday, with North and South America currently having four of the 10 worst hit countries in the world.The disease was “highly active” in Central and South America, the WHO’s top emergency expert Mike Ryan said, highlighting problems in Brazil and Mexico.The current situation in Brazil, now one of the global hot-spots for the virus, was of increasing concern especially in heavily-populated cities, he told a press conference.The country’s health system was “still coping”, although some intensive care units were at a critical stage and under heavy pressure with more than 90% bed occupancy rates, Ryan said.Mexico meanwhile has nearly 130,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19, and more than 15,000 deaths, the WHO said.Brazil is the second worst hit country in the world, with more than 800,000 cases and 41,000 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. Both countries lag behind the United States, the worst hit country, which has had more than 2 million cases and nearly 114,000 deaths.“We are very much in the upswing of this pandemic, particularly in the global South,” Ryan said. “Some countries are having trouble exiting of the so-called lockdowns as they are seeing an increase in cases.”It was possible the disease was spreading again as societies reopened and people began meeting again, especially when there was inadequate testing and social distancing was insufficient.Still, he acknowledged the pressures on countries to get back to normal especially to reduce the economic damage the crisis has wrought.”There is a careful balance between keeping people at home... and the untoward effect of that on economic and society. That is not an easy balance. There are no correct answers,” Ryan said.Ryan said that although some countries appeared to be over the worst of the virus, clusters of the disease were still occurring. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Gheybreyesus said that vigilance was required worldwide against the “very dangerous virus” even in regions where it appeared to be on the wane.“Our fear is although it is declining in Europe it is increasing in other parts of the world. Even Europe cannot be safe because the virus can be reintroduced to Europe,” he said.Tedros was also firm on the need for any vaccines had to be shared fairly between countries, amid concerns some could hoard any drugs they develop.Vaccines should be made available as a global public good, to ensure everyone had fair access to any life-saving products that are developed, Tedros said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-hitting-the-americas-hardest-says-who/story-duLfzss8EUscHXQqPsfbfN.html

13-06-2020||World||Pakistan unveils 7.13 trillion budget for new fiscal year, defence gets around 1.3 trillion||Pakistan government on Friday unveiled a Rs 7.13 trillion (Rs 7,13,700 crore) “corona budget” for the new fiscal year, including a Rs 1.289 trillion (Rs 1,28,900 crore) defence budget which is almost 4.7 per cent higher than last year’s.Last year the defence budget was 1.227 trillion (1,22,700 crore).The government set a meagre 2.1 per cent GDP growth target for the next year.Minister for Industries and Production Hammad Azhar presented the budget for the fiscal year 2020-21 in the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament amidst a spike in the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.Prime Minister Imran Khan was present during the budget session. “The budget has been based on the current critical situation due to the coronavirus pandemic. So we are trying to give maximum relief to the people and not imposing any new tax,” Azhar said.He said the total expenses of the government would be Rs 7.13 trillion (Rs 7,13,700 crores), but there would be a Rs 3,437 billion (3,43,700 crores) deficit in revenues and expenses which was 7 per cent of the GDP.He said that the total tax revenues would be Rs 6,573 billion (6,57,300 crores). But the bulk of the revenues would go to the provinces under a previous formula which Azhar announced to change. He said the total development budget of the centre and province would be Rs 1,324 billion (1,32,400 crores), whereas the federal component of the development programmes would be Rs 650 billion (65,000 crores), which include 73 per cent for ongoing projects and 27 per cent for new projects.Among the most controversial moves was to freeze the salaries and pensions of the serving and retired government servants who traditionally were given a raise in the budget. “Lockdown, social distancing and precautionary measures have adversely affected the economy. Like other economies around the world, Pakistan’s economy also took a hit due to the coronavirus,” he said.Azhar said Rs 55 billion (5,500 crores) special grant would be given to the Pakistan-occupied government and Rs 32 billion (3,200 crores) special grant to the Gilgit-Baltistan government. He said that the government was trying to increase taxes as the current tax to GDP ratio was 11 per cent which was very low as compared to other nations. “We are trying to improve our ratio.” Among the increase in taxes, he said the tax on tobacco and its products was increased from 65 per cent to 100 per cent.He said that the government as per policy did not receive any loan from the State Bank of Pakistan. He said no supplementary grants were given to any department and strict financial discipline was followed and the policy would continue. It was the second budget of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government which came to power in August 2018 and is still struggling to stabilize the economy, which registered negative 0.38 per cent growth in the outgoing fiscal year ending on June 30.Opposition parties protested vociferously against the policies of the Imran Khan-led government, creating ruckus in Parliament. But the minister continued his speech and presented the budget.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-unveils-7-13-trillion-budget-for-new-fiscal-year-defence-gets-around-1-3-trillion/story-lP1rBsVCMg2QDhmXNeMQXM.html

13-06-2020||World||‘Existing polio vaccine shows promise, could protect against Covid-19’: Study||While scientists and experts continue to bolster the effort to arrive at the much-awaited vaccine for Covid-19, some experts are looking at the potential of existing drugs and vaccines in fighting the virus. A latest study published in the medical journal Science explains if existing live vaccines can help prevent Covid-19.The study talks about oral polio vaccine (OPV) which comprises live attenuated viruses and can reduce the incidence of other infections.“An increasing body of evidence suggests that live attenuated vaccines can also induce broader protection against unrelated pathogens likely by inducing interferon and other innate immunity mechanisms that are yet to be identified,” the study reads. Also read: Centre reviews use of HCQ and antibiotic combo in Covid-19 casesAccording to the researchers, the stimulation of innate immune system by live attenuated vaccines in general, and oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in particular, “could provide temporary protection against coronavirus disease 2019”The research also points to the efficacy of certain vaccines against tuberculosis and whooping cough in fighting infections. “Attenuated bacterial vaccines such as Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) against tuberculosis, as well as experimental live attenuated vaccine against pertussis (whooping cough), were also shown to protect against heterologous infections,” it added. Medical reports and scientific research suggest that Covid-19 may result in suppressed innate immune responses. Therefore, stimulation of innate immunity by live attenuated vaccines such as the OPV could increase resistance to infection by “the causal virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)”.“If the results of randomized controlled trial (RCTs) with OPV are positive, OPV could be used to protect the most vulnerable populations,” the study concluded. Covid-19 has infected over 7 million people worldwide while more than 4 lakh people have lost their lives across the globe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-existing-polio-vaccine-shows-promise-could-protect-against-covid-19-study/story-wAFnAe9VTOZ6vgKa98RX3H.html
13-06-2020||World||George Floyd death: New York governor signs police accountability legislation||New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law on Friday a sweeping package of police accountability measures that received new backing following protests of George Floyd’s killing, including one allowing the release of officers’ long-withheld disciplinary records.The measures were approved earlier this week by the state’s Democratic-led Legislature. Some of the bills had been proposed in years past and failed to win approval, but lawmakers moved with new urgency in the wake of massive, nationwide demonstrations over Floyd’s death at the hands of police in Minneapolis.“Police reform is long overdue, and Mr. Floyd’s murder is only the most recent murder,” Cuomo, a Democrat, said.Cuomo was joined at the signing ceremony by the Rev. Al Sharpton, Valerie Bell, the mother of Sean Bell, who was killed by an officer in 2006, and Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who was killed by police in New York in 2014.“It was a long time coming, but it came,” Carr said.Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins thanks Carr and Bell “for being brave and strong.”“We are at a moment of reckoning. There is no doubt about it,” she said.The laws will ban police chokeholds, make it easier to sue people who call police on others without good reason, and set up a special prosecutor’s office to investigate the deaths of people during and following encounters with police officers.“These bills mean some substantive change, so that we won’t be sitting here going over this after the next funeral and after the next situation,” Sharpton said.Some bills, including body camera legislation, drew support from Republicans, who opposed legislation that repealed a state law long used to block the release of police disciplinary records over concerns about officers’ privacy.Eliminating the law, known as Section 50-a, would make complaints against officers, as well as transcripts and final dispositions of disciplinary proceedings, public for the first time in decades.New York Police Department spokesperson Sgt. Jessica McRorie said the department “will review the final version of the legislation and utilize it in a manner that ensures greater transparency and fairness.”The state’s approximately 500 police departments will all have to come up with plans to address everything from use of force to implicit bias awareness training by next April under an executive order that Cuomo said he will issue Friday.The governor said New York is the first to come up with such a plan and warned that police departments who fail to do so will not receive state aid.Patrick Lynch, president of the Police Benevolent Association, the city’s largest police union, said in a news release that Cuomo and the legislative leaders “have no business celebrating today.”Lynch said police officers spend their days addressing the “failures” of elected officials. “Now, we won’t even be able to do that,” he said. “We will be permanently frozen, stripped of all resources and unable to do the job.”Meanwhile, members of the New York City Council said they would be working to cut $1 billion in NYPD spending for the next fiscal year. The cuts would include overtime, headcount through attrition and shifting the department’s responsibilities, according to a joint council statement.“Our budget must reflect the reality that policing needs fundamental reform. Over the last few weeks, we have seen an outpouring of New Yorkers demanding change from their leaders,” the statement said. “It is our job to listen – and to act. We will not let this moment pass, and we will fight for the budget they deserve.”Cuomo has 10 days to act on other bills passed by lawmakers this week, including legislation prohibiting police from using racial profiling and another bill ensuring that individuals under arrest or in policy custody receive attention for medical and mental health needs.Lawmakers also passed a bill to require New York to collect and report the race and other demographic details of individuals who are charged. The legislation says police departments must “promptly report” to the state the death of any people who die in police custody and in an attempt to establish custody, and provide a demographic breakdown.During this week’s legislative debates, many lawmakers relayed their personal experiences with police.On Friday, Stewart-Cousins, who is the first black woman to lead the state Senate, said her youngest son was once stopped and frisked when he was 18 and said he ended up with a fractured nose. “Thank God I was able to bring him home,” she said.“Every parent, every mother who looks like me understood that scary notion with our kids, with our husbands, with our brothers,” she said.Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said he’s had “not-so-positive” interactions with the police — from when he was young and even now as legislative leader.“Growing up when you heard the stories of Anthony Baez and Sean Bell and Eric Garner, as a black man, I felt that could be me,” Heastie said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-death-new-york-governor-signs-police-accountability-legislation/story-ebdKo2CojIya77TpvJlx3J.html
13-06-2020||World||Protests and a violent arrest reveal Canada’s racial cracks||The racial turmoil that has gripped the US is causing Canada to publicly confront its own shortcomings in the treatment of minority groups by police and other authorities.Against the backdrop of protests across North America over the death of George Floyd, Canada’s longest-standing racial fault line -- the treatment of its indigenous people -- burst into view as a video surfaced of the violent arrest of a prominent First Nations leader.The footage showed Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers tackling and punching Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation Chief Allan Adam in Fort McMurray, Alberta, in March during a dispute about expired license plates. Adam can be seen bleeding from the face as he is led away by officers. He was charged with resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer. His lawyer is now seeking to have the charges stayed on the basis that his rights were violated because of his race.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said an investigation of the incident by Alberta authorities must be open and transparent and acknowledged that many black and indigenous Canadians don’t feel safe around police. He said he raised the issue during a weekly call with the country’s premiers and that he’ll look at changes to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.“Systemic racism is an issue right across the country, in all our institutions, including in all our police forces, including in the RCMP,” Trudeau said.Troubled HistoryThe video of the Adam arrest followed a week in which thousands of Canadians in cities across the country marched to show their solidarity with US protesters. The footage also served to underscore that Canada is far from immune to the racial strife of its neighbor to the south -- and has its own problems in policing.In a mirror of the issues that have driven American protesters into the streets, a Canadian Broadcasting Corp. investigation in 2018 found that black and indigenous people are disproportionately the victims of fatal encounters with police. Immigration and religious differences have also been a source of conflict. Quebec faced a backlash over a policy that restricted traditional Muslim face coverings. Last year, famous hockey announcer Don Cherry was fired over comments about immigrants that many called racist.But perhaps no racial issue in Canada is as painful as its troubled history of mistreating indigenous groups. Last year, a federal investigation found that the country had “staggering rates” of violence against indigenous women and girls, due to “persistent and deliberate” rights violations and abuses.The issue of indigenous control of their traditional territories -- a common flashpoint in negotiations over resource projects like logging, oil development and pipelines -- exploded into a series of protests that blocked railways earlier this year, following the arrest of some First Nations protesters in British Columbia.“This systemic discrimination and racism has been here for hundreds of years,” said Lorraine Whitman, president of the Native Women’s Association of Canada. “It has to be addressed, and it has to be addressed now.”Whitman gives poor grades to Canada’s efforts to rectify these problems. Even the government of Trudeau, who has a global image as a “woke” leader and who made reconciliation with native peoples a key plank of his 2015 campaign, has failed to take sufficient action, she said. Some conservatives mocked Trudeau’s efforts by calling him the ‘Apologizer-in-Chief.’Race DataThere are signs some government bodies are making changes as a result of the recent protests -- including a couple of longstanding policies that made it difficult to properly analyze racial injustice.The Ontario agency that probes police incidents and misconduct, known as the Special Investigations Unit, said this week it will begin collecting race-based data. The unit previously collected only the ages and genders of people involved in incidents that led to serious injury, death or sexual assault.The country’s national statistics agency also said it will begin gathering labor force data by race with its July report, bringing it in line with its US counterpart, which has long done so. Statistics Canada’s monthly labor force survey currently doesn’t track employment conditions by visible-minority status, making it difficult to ascertain how economic disruptions such as Covid-19 are affecting black Canadians and other groups. The survey does include data on immigrants and indigenous Canadians.“We know that there are unfairnesses in our systems,” Trudeau said earlier this week. “It’s just really hard to change, and what it takes is a recognition and a desire to make these changes. That’s exactly what we need to start doing as a country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-and-a-violent-arrest-reveal-canada-s-racial-cracks/story-ogrBMKMciMxb5zwQw6qE2M.html

Li died from coronavirus in February, his wife Fu Xuejie was pregnant with their second child. Fu Xuejie shared the baby boy’s image on instant messaging app WeChat on Friday and described the newborn as the “final gift” from her late husband. Li, who worked as an ophthalmologist at the Wuhan central hospital, was arrested by Chinese authorities for spreading rumours. He was trying to sound an alarm about Covid-19 situation in the country which quickly assumed the shape of a pandemic. On December 30, Li chanced upon a test result of a patient who had been admitted to his hospital with a new, unidentified disease. He shared the information on a private WeChat group with seven other friends, saying that from the results it looked like SARS - an epidemic which killed hundreds in China in 2002-03.Li later said he only wanted to warn friends about the disease but his post went viral.The doctor and his friends were soon summoned by the Wuhan police for spreading rumours and were forced to sign a confession. After his release,Li he went back to the hospital and started working but contracted Covid-19 from a patient.Li was hospitalised on January 12 and in the following days, his condition deteriorated. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and tested positive for Covid-19, he subsequently lost his life. The virus outbreak that started from China has affected almost every country in the world with over 7 million people infected and more than 4 lakh people killed by the deadly contagion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/final-gift-widow-of-chinese-covid-19-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang-gives-birth/story-gg57opHwLpKDR9xzdv7zRK.html

Anmol Narang, is a second-generation immigrant born and raised in Roswell, Georgia. She did a year of undergraduate study at the Georgia Institute of Technology before transferring to West Point, where she will graduate Saturday with a degree in nuclear engineering. She hopes to pursue a career in air defense systems.“I am excited and honored to be fulfilling my dream of graduating from West Point,” Narang said in a news release from the Sikh Coalition, a nonprofit based in New York that works to protect the constitutional right to practice faith without fear. “The confidence and support of my community back home in Georgia has been deeply meaningful to me, and I am humbled that in reaching this goal, I am showing other Sikh Americans that any career path is possible for anyone willing to rise to the challenge.” Narang will complete her Basic Officer Leadership Course at Fort Sill in Lawton, Oklahoma, officials said. Following that, she will then head to her first post in Okinawa, Japan, in January.Congress passed a law in 1987 that prohibited Sikhs and other religious communities from maintaining their articles of faith while in the military. A Sikh’s visible articles of faith, including turbans and unshorn facial hair, were banned.Narang required no accommodation for her articles of faith, but the coalition said “her exemplary service to date underscores how diversity and pluralism remain core strengths of the U.S. military and the country as a whole.” US Army Capt. Simratpal Singh, a family friend, said he is proud of Narang who is “breaking a barrier for any Sikh American who wishes to serve.” “The broader acceptance of Sikh service members among all of the service branches, as well as in top tier leadership spaces like West Point, will continue to benefit not just the rights of religious minority individuals, but the strength and diversity of the U.S. military,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-sikh-woman-to-graduate-from-us-military-academy-at-west-point/story-jldZ4T9IiFZEp8tJPuzC9N.html
13-06-2020||World||Democratic presidential nominee Biden’s VP list narrows||Joe Biden’s search for a running mate is entering a second round of vetting for a dwindling list of potential vice presidential nominees, with several black women in strong contention.Democrats with knowledge of the process said Biden’s search committee has narrowed the choices to as few as six serious contenders after initial interviews. Among the group still in contention: Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California, as well as Susan Rice, who served as President Barack Obama’s national security adviser.Those with knowledge declined to name other contenders and said the process remains somewhat fluid. Additional candidates may still be asked to submit to the extensive document review process now underway for some top contenders. Those familiar with Biden’s search spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the process.The campaign dismissed the idea of a shortened list as early speculation. “Those who talk don’t know and those who know don’t talk,” said Andrew Bates, a Biden spokesperson.Biden, who has already said he will pick a woman as his running mate, is facing increased calls from Democrats to put a woman of color on the ticket — both because of the outsize role that black voters played in Biden’s road to the nomination and because of the reckoning over racism and inequality roiling the nation following the death of George Floyd. The black Minneapolis man died after a white police officer pressed his knee on his neck for several minutes, an episode that was captured on video.Terry McAuliffe, the former Virginia governor and former Democratic National Committee chairman, said that while Biden’s choice was likely to be “all about personal chemistry,” it would be “exciting for the party” to have a black woman on a major party presidential ticket for the first time.The campaign’s list includes several black women, including Harris and Rice. Advisers have also looked closely at Florida Rep. Val Demings and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, both of whom are black, and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Latina.Biden’s vetting committee had conversations with a larger group of women earlier this spring; those continuing on in the process have been asked to turn over financial records, past writings and other documentation. Biden has had various public and private interactions with many of the women his vetting committee has considered thus far, but has not yet had any formal one-on-one interviews expressly to discuss the No. 2 spot on the ticket. Those aren’t expected for several weeks.Rice, who worked closely with Biden during his time as vice president, has emerged as a favorite among some former Obama administration officials and is personally close to the former president. She has never held elected office but has extensive foreign policy experience, including as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. She’s also been an outspoken critic of the Trump administration since leaving the White House and considered running for U.S. Senate in Maine.Rice has long been a target of Republicans, including for statements she made after the deadly 2012 attacks on Americans in Benghazi, Libya. Republicans have also accused her of spying on Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser, though records declassified by the Trump administration show no evidence of Rice improperly accessing any information.Harris and Warren have been seen as top contenders for the No. 2 spot since ending their own presidential campaigns.Warren and Biden have forged a surprising bond in recent months and talk regularly about the progressive policy ideas the Massachusetts senator put at the forefront of her campaign. Biden already has adopted her proposed bankruptcy law overhaul. And now, with the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic slowdown elevating the nuts-and-bolts of governing, some Democrats see Warren’s policy credentials as an asset to the ticket.A Biden-Warren pairing would mean both Democrats on the ticket are white and in their 70s. Biden is 77, and Warren is 70.Harris is the lone black contender who has won statewide office, notable experience given Biden’s emphasis on wanting a partner “ready to be president.” She and Biden have also demonstrated a comfortable manner with each other in online fundraisers. Harris is an expert voice in discussions of criminal justice, but some black progressives view her background as a prosecutor skeptically.One contender whose standing does appear to have fallen is Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. During that period, more than two dozen people — mostly minorities — died during encounters with police.While the people with knowledge of Biden’s vetting process did not rule Klobuchar out, she is widely viewed among Democrats with close ties to the Biden campaign as less likely to be tapped given recent events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democratic-presidential-nominee-biden-s-vp-list-narrows/story-vbt5AU2hdGHY7QquSTrivO.html

In a redacted Dec. 1, 2018 memo, CSIS said it was advised by the US FBI of plans to arrest Meng when she arrived on a flight to Vancouver International Airport later that same day.“The arrest is likely to send shockwaves around the world,” CSIS said. “The planned event will be of great consequence internationally and bilaterally,” the report said.Huawei lawyers called the documents proof that authorities had conspired against Meng.Meng is accused by US authorities of bank fraud for misleading HSBC about Huawei’s relationship with a company operating in Iran, putting HSBC at risk of fines and penalties for breaking US sanctions on Tehran.Meng’s lawyers have argued the case should be thrown out because Canada did not have sanctions against Iran. Meng says she is innocent. Last month, a Canadian judge allowed the case to continue, rejecting defense arguments that the US charges against Meng do not constitute crimes in Canada.The new court documents show the CSIS was concerned about when Meng’s arrest might become public. Her lawyers noted the point was of particular interest, since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were attending the G20 summit in Argentina and dining together on the evening of Dec. 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-spy-agency-warned-of-shock-waves-from-arrest-of-huawei-founder-s-daughter/story-61ldDnkQoIbobxAn0cLaUI.html
13-06-2020||World||Firefighters grapple with triple-digit heat against wildfire||Hundreds of Arizona residents under an evacuation notice were allowed to return home Friday but were told to remain ready to leave at a moment’s notice as a wildfire burns in a national forest near Tucson.Firefighters are trying to keep the blaze in canyons and ridges and prevent it from moving downhill.“The fire activity near the homes has dropped down due to the good work of our firefighters,” said Adam Jarrold, public information officer for the fire management team.Most of the western United States is experiencing extreme dryness or drought, creating challenging conditions for wildfire season, Bryan Henry, meteorologist with the National Interagency Fire Center, said in a recent fire season outlook.Authorities have said southern Arizona’s dry, hot weather and the steep, rocky topography have been the main challenges in fighting the fire. Friday was the hottest day yet for crews battling the blaze, with temperatures forecast to reach 107 (41.6 Celsius) in the afternoon.National Weather Service forecasters said temperatures were projected to remain in the triple digits through the weekend with a 10% chance of dry thunderstorms or potentially dangerous downbursts that bring only a trace of moisture but can kick up gusts of wind that feed flames.“We do have some weather concerns,” said incident meteorologist Gary Zell, who was stationed Friday at now-closed Catalina State Park.“These guys are heroes, working all day in up to 107 degrees (41.6 Celsius),” said Zell, who has worked wildfires around the West for two decades. “This is the first time I’ve worked a fire in my hometown so I’m pretty vested in making sure everything goes well.”Authorities said the fire’s growth slowed overnight Thursday but that it remained a threat. Flames have been visible from Tucson at night, and smoke from the fire plumed over a suburb Friday morning. Later in the day, an air tanker was seen spreading red fire retardant over the flames.The firefighting effort will get help from Federal Emergency Management Agency, which officials say has granted Arizona’s request for federal funds.The fire, sparked June 5 by lightning, was only 10% contained as of Friday morning. The National Wildfire Coordinating Group said in its daily operation plan that containment may not be achieved for weeks.Pima County officials on Thursday issued an evacuation notice for approximately 300 homes in a area south of the Coronado National Forest. But the notice was pulled back late Friday afternoon after fire officials determined it was safe for them to return home, said Deputy James Allerton, a sheriff’s department spokesman.Horses at the Catalina State Park Equestrian Center were transported out of the area for their safety.As of Friday, the fire had burned 11 square miles (29 square kilometers) of mostly brush and tall grass. Specialized crews were assessing potential threats to homes and other structures to identify access routes and develop contingency plans in case the fire spreads into residential areas.In the neighborhoods closest to the fire, sheriff’s deputies checked IDs to confirm that people trying to enter were residents, as helicopters dropped water on hot spots.Sheriff’s officials went door to door in neighborhoods on Thursday to notify residents of the evacuation notice, which a sheriff’s spokesman said Friday wasn’t mandatory.“People are not required to leave, however we are telling people we may not be able to come back and assist if things start to burn,” said Deputy James Allerton.No injuries or structural damage was reported, Allerton said.Travis Mayberry, an operations section chief for the fire management team, said Friday much of the fire was burning in terrain too rugged for grounds crews to work safely, particularly if they needed to escape quickly.“It’s not a great place for us to put people in to safely work,” he said. “Ït’s just too steep.”“In Oro Valley, on another side of the Santa Catalina mountains, dozens of people parked their vehicles Friday afternoon alongside State Route 77 to watch three helicopters battling flames descending the slopes as smoke poured into the sky.The Pima County Sheriff’s Department has been asking people to avoid the area during the fire unless they live or have business there to prevent traffic congestion and roadway dangers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/firefighters-grapple-with-triple-digit-heat-against-wildfire/story-P1ckNjQrgWRtDg10Pscx6H.html
13-06-2020||World||As Covid-19 numbers fall, Canadians pessimistic about country’s economy||While Covid-19 cases and deaths are gradually tapering off in Canada, citizens are growing more pessimistic about the future with relation to the country’s economic outlook, with nearly half expecting matters to get worse.According to a new survey by a non-profit public polling organization Angus Reid Institute or ARI, the country is evenly split over the direction any post-Covid-19 recovery may take. In a release, ARI noted, “When it comes to the economic outlook for the country, residents are near-evenly divided about whether the worst has passed or is yet to come. Older men are more optimistic, while all other age and gender groups are relatively closely divided.” Those feeling confident about the future narrowly outnumber those despondent: 51 per cent to 49 per cent. Also read| Canada’s junk food consumption, alcohol and tobacco intake rises amid Covid-19: SurveyMore troubling, it said, was data from the survey is the “dramatic increase” in the number of those expressing doubt about whether their jobs will return or those positions are gone permanently. ARI stated, “At the end of March just 17 per cent expressed these sentiments. Today, that number has more than doubled to 38 per cent.”The percentage of people who are doubtful about returning to their positions with same number of hours they worked prior to the pandemic have spiked from 13 per cent in March to 29 per cent. And those who believe their jobs have gone for good have more than doubled from 4 to 9 per cent. These sentiments come despite Canada recording a surprise addition of 290,000 jobs in the month of May, though unemployment, at nearly 14 per cent, remains at a historic high.Also read: Canadian PM Trudeau defends decision to attend protest amid Covid-19 curbsCanada crossed 8,000 deaths from the virus on Friday, though the increase in fatalities, at just 55, has been declining day by day.

It said, “As communities begin to allow businesses, schools, and other institutions to reopen, the gaze of many Canadians has shifted at least slightly to their province’s – and their own – economic recovery.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-covid-19-numbers-fall-canadians-pessimistic-about-country-s-economy/story-Ue9SFk0fd6g7iw3ak0yenI.html
13-06-2020||World||Known blood pressure drugs do not put patients at greater Covid-19 risk: Study||New research offers reassuring evidence to hundreds of millions of people with high blood pressure that popular anti-hypertension drugs do not put them at greater risk from Covid-19 as some experts had feared.Two blood pressure-lowering drug classes, called ACE inhibitors and ARBs, came under scrutiny after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in April that 72% of hospitalized Covid-19 patients 65 or older had hypertension.ACE inhibitors and ARBs are thought to trigger activity along the same biological pathways used by the Covid-19 novel coronavirus to attack the lungs.Researchers at Oxford University had recommended some patients stop the drugs until the risks were better known, while others argued patients should stay on the medications. An expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness in Baltimore described the debate as “one of the most important clinical questions.”The new study made publicly available on Friday found no clinically significant increased risk of either a diagnosis or hospitalization of Covid-19 with ACE or ARB use compared with other first-line drug treatments for hypertension.The authors recommended that patients should not discontinue their treatment to avoid the virus, which has infected over 7.5 million people worldwide and killed more than 420,000.“Our findings are quite reassuring,” said Marc Suchard, a biostatistician at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-led the study. “Taking an ACE or an ARB is just as safe as other first-list hypertension agents in terms of your risk of contracting Covid-19.”The study analyzed the electronic medical records of 1.1 million patients on anti-hypertension drugs from the United States and Spain and has not yet been peer reviewed.It was part of the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics program (OHDSI, pronounced Odyssey) response to Covid-19, in collaboration with the US Department of Veterans Affairs, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and SIDIAP, a Spanish health research organization.OHDSI is an open-source collaborative research platform that conducts large-scale studies.The findings join a growing body of evidence showing that the life-saving drugs neither increase nor reduce the risk of contracting Covid-19 or developing a severe case of the virus.Harmony R. Reynolds, a cardiologist at New York University Grossman School of Medicine and the lead author of a study published last month in The New England Journal of Medicine, said she had been besieged by calls from worried patients.With little research to go on, she advised them to stay on the drugs and embarked on a study with colleagues to analyze the medical records of over 12,000 Covid-19 patients at NYU’s Langone Health system. They found that those using ACE inhibitors or ARBs were no more likely to test positive than those who were not, nor was their risk of severe illness higher. The same held true for other classes of drugs - beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics.Separate studies of more than 12,000 patients in Spain and more than 30,000 health system beneficiaries in Italy reached similar conclusions. They were published last month in The Lancet and the New England Journal, respectively.Another study in the New England Journal in May reported no increased risk of hospital deaths associated with ACE inhibitors. Both that study and another on hydroxychloroquine were retracted earlier this month after the co-authors said they could no longer vouch for the validity of the data they obtained from Surgisphere, a private medical record firm, however.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/known-blood-pressure-drugs-do-not-put-patients-at-greater-covid-19-risk-study/story-oyiCNUK3xsdZKQgnAcH3yK.html

13-06-2020||World||Jacksonville’s history complicates Republican convention||When Republicans descend on Jacksonville, Florida, to officially renominate President Donald Trump for a second term, it will be a well-choreographed affair that will unfold against the backdrop of a backdrop of a military town, a bastion of conservatism and a must-win battleground state.When he accepts his party’s nomination in late August for another White House bid, the president will be doing so amid the political and racial divisions deeply ingrained in his host city.“I think Jacksonville will take a lot of people by surprise in its diversity. But this is a complicated city,” said Alan Bliss, the chief executive officer of the Jacksonville Historical Society.“I think it’s been seen as inflexibly and uncritically conservative,” he said. “Jacksonville has been seen as having clung uncritically and inflexibly to its ideas of its past.”It is a place still coming to terms with its Southern heritage while trying to become a more cosmopolitan place in the shadows of glitzier Miami, with its world-famous beaches, and better-known Orlando, home to Disney World and Universal studios.The city’s sprawling metropolitan region is home to 1.5 million Floridians, nearly a third of them black and about a tenth Latino. It lies just south of Florida’s border with Georgia, and about 290 miles (about 467 kilometers) north of the president’s Mar-a-Lago compound in Palm Beach.The Republican National Committee picked Jacksonville for the political spectacle after North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, wouldn’t give in to the president’s insistence that large gathering be held without social distancing measures. On Friday, Florida announced its highest one-day spike in Covid-19 cases — with 1,900 new cases the day before — but officials said they will take necessary precautions during the August convention.The city, which openly campaigned for the right to host the president and the political convention, had to overcome concerns that it could host a major event. When the city hosted the Super Bowl in 2005, it had to use cruise ships as floating hotels to expand its inventory of rooms.Routine convention business will still be held in Charlotte, but splashier events will take place in Jacksonville, one of Florida’s largest cities best known for its professional football team, the Jacksonville Jaguars.It is home to one of the country’s most important seaports, as well as the largest Navy base in the Southeast.Jacksonville has long been known as a bastion of conservatism, but in recent years it has become more diverse politically. While it remains a Republican stronghold, it’s not always as reliable as it once was.In 2011, Jacksonville elected its first black mayor, a Democrat. Five years later, Trump narrowly won Duval County. But two years ago, black Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum got more of the county’s votes than now-Gov. Ron DeSantis, a close Trump ally.“Jacksonville has made a few strides, but Jacksonville still has not shown that it wants to deal with some of its problems, especially the race problems it needs to deal with,” said Rodney Hurst, 76.Sixty years ago, Hurst was part of a group of young black men and women who had just dispersed from a peaceful protest at a downtown lunch counter when a mob of whites began indiscriminately clubbing African Americans in downtown Jacksonville. The day is now remembered as Ax Handle Saturday.“They swung at me, and I had no choice but to run,” recalled Hurst, who was 16 when the mob came charging at him with clubs.The anniversary of that day will be remembered in a public square across City Hall — on the same day as the president’s Aug. 27 made-for-television address.The commemoration will be held a mile away from the convention, in a park named for Civil War veteran Charles C. Hemming, after he donated a towering Confederate monument in the park in 1898. Earlier this week, the city removed the monument in the cloak of darkness amid protests across the country decrying racism and deadly police force against blacks.The city’s mayor, Lenny Curry, vowed to remove other monuments, as statues across the South and elsewhere were being vandalized or toppled by protesters.“If our opinions and our policies don’t evolve, then we’re not growing and we are stagnant,” said Curry, a former chair of the Republican Party of Florida.A spokesman for the president said the campaign was mindful of the city’s racist past. Paris Dennard, an RNC adviser for black media affairs, called the president a “champion” for the black community.“While we cannot erase some of the darkest moments of our nation’s past, we can denounce them, learn from them, fight for justice and a more perfect union for every American. That is exactly what President Trump has done,” Dennard said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jacksonville-s-history-complicates-republican-convention/story-Z8LTxbtAuR71quoM8XZZLM.html

The crisis could provoke the region’s “worst recession in history”, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) said.“We’re worried the region could come out of this crisis with more debt, poorer, hungrier and with more unemployment. And most of all, angry,” said ECLAC general secretary Alicia Barcena.The fracture lines in Brazilian society are already evident. The country’s President, Jair Bolsonaro, has repeatedly downplayed the pandemic’s scale, calling Covid-19 “a flu”.Brazil on Thursday passed two grim milestones: 40,000 Covid-19 deaths and some 800,000 coronavirus cases. Despite the rising toll Brazil’s two largest cities - Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro - reopened shopping malls, even as the health ministry said there had been more than 1,200 deaths in the last 24 hours and more than 30,000 new cases.Protesting that stance, campaigners on Thursday dug 100 graves on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, each marked with a black cross, to denounce what they called the “incompetence” of authorities.n the US, President Donald Trump was leading the charge to continue reopening the economy. The pandemic is not tamed there, with more than 2 million infections and 114,000 deaths. Figures showed a spike in new infections in key states including Texas, California, Arizona and Florida.In China, Beijing reported two more confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, taking the tally of new infections to three in less than a week after city authorities lowered the outbreak emergency response to level three.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-roils-latin-america-as-the-region-faces-recession/story-5Zb4uaMlQkYZh1inHb8BbN.html
13-06-2020||World||Donald Trump says he will ‘do other things’ if he loses 2020 US presidential election||US president Donald Trump said he will go on to other things if he loses the November 3 election, after Democratic opponent Joe Biden said the Republican might cheat and refuse to leave the White House.“Certainly if I don’t win, I don’t win. I mean, you know, go on and do other things,” Trump told Fox News Channel in a television interview broadcast on Friday.As the race between Trump and Biden heats up ahead of the election, the two have increasingly asserted that the other side intends to cheat their way to victory.Biden, who is leading Trump in most national polls, earlier this week said his greatest concern was that Trump would try to “steal” the election, though the former vice president did not elaborate on how he thought Trump might cheat. Biden said he is confident soldiers would escort Trump from the White House if he loses and does not recognize the result.Trump’s comment to Fox News suggested he could accept the election result but the president did not specifically say so. Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh on Thursday said Trump would accept the result. ​ Trump has accused Democrats of aiming to use an increase in mail-in voting as a venue for rigging the election, while Biden has pledged to deploy lawyers to polling stations across the country to look out for Republican efforts to suppress the vote.Election experts and officials are bracing for a potentially tumultuous election night.A surge in mail-in voting is expected due to concerns over the coronavirus pandemic, and experts warn the process could be marred by chaos of the type already seen in primary elections held in states during the viral outbreak.Large numbers of mail ballots not delivered in time to be cast or counted could lead to legal challenges over election results. Counting mail ballots also takes more time because a voter’s identity must first be validated, raising the prospect that the election outcome will not be known well past Election Day, experts say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-will-do-other-things-if-he-loses-2020-us-presidential-election/story-4wPJY264k3uPz3A8vW6chL.html
13-06-2020||World||Black Lives Matter: Gandhi statue protected as London set for tense weekend||Extreme far-right groups are planning counter-protests over the weekend in London when large numbers of Black Lives Matter activists are expected to stage another demonstration, prompting officials to protect statues of Mahatma Gandhi and Winston Churchill.The London mayor’s office confirmed on Friday evening that Gandhi’s statue has been “temporarily covered for its protection”, as mayor Sadiq Khan and others appealed to people to stay away from the weekend demonstrations, which also pose challenges in the context of coronavirus.Khan said: “I’m extremely concerned that further protests in central London not only risk spreading Covid-19, but could lead to disorder, vandalism and violence. Extreme far-right groups who advocate hatred and division are planning counter-protests, which means that the risk of disorder is high”.“Be in no doubt these counter-protests are there to provoke violence, and their only goal is to distract and hijack this important issue. Staying home and ignoring them is the best response this weekend”, he added.Last Sunday witnessed the first major BLM demonstration in London, when the statues of Churchill and Gandhi were targeted, among others. In Bristol, the statue of slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down and thrown into the Avon river.A series of tweets, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that it is “absurd and shameful” that Churchill’s statue had been targeted, and appealed to people not to join the weekend protests.Johnson, who wrote a biography of Churchill in 2014, added: “We cannot now try to edit or censor our past. We cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations”.“They had different perspectives, different understandings or rights and wrongs. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults. To tear them down would be to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come”.The Leicester City Council is reviewing all street names, statues and monuments in the city with a large population of Indian origin. A petition for the removal of Gandhi’s statue there enlisted over 5,000 signatures by Friday evening.Keith Vaz, who was Leicester East MP for 33 years, said: “This is a dreadful petition that seeks to divide communities in Leicester and in the country. Those behind it know full well the consequences of what they are asking for. Gandhi’s statues in Leicester and London are an inspiration for peace, harmony and non-violence”.“He was one of the greatest peacemakers in history. If this is not withdrawn I will certainly refer it to the police to consider whether it incites racial hatred. We have come a long way in 33 years on racial equality but clearly there is a long way to go. If there is any attempt to remove it I will be there to defend it personally.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-gandhi-statue-protected-as-london-set-for-tense-weekend/story-DOR1VYBzjZLcr9GKD8uffI.html

The explosion occurred in Saddar area of the city, which is not far away from the General Headquarters of the Pakistan Army. Police spokesperson Sajidul Hassan told Dawn News that initial reports suggest that the explosive material was planted in a nearby electric pole.

The police spokesperson said that investigative teams and people from the forensics science lab were collecting evidence from the area. The spokesperson said that the blast was an “attempt at organised terrorism but those playing with the lives of the public would not be able to escape the law.” No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast, which occurred when the country is battling the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bomb-explosion-in-pakistan-market-kills-one-15-injured/story-s0E14p0DpPX1yWtvKBFgsL.html

William Robert Cable, 38, allegedly preyed on homeless people in the city of Huntington Beach, feeding them food laced with oleoresin capsicum, which officials described as being twice as strong as pepper spray used by police. “They were exploited and poisoned as part of a twisted form of entertainment, and their pain was recorded so that it could be relived by their attacker over and over again,” Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said in a statement Thursday. Some victims were told they were participating in a “spicy food challenge” and others were not, authorities said. Some were given other food and beer to get them to eat the poisoned food. The victims had seizure-like symptoms, difficulty breathing and suffered vomiting and intense mouth and stomach pain. Some had to be hospitalised. Officials asked for public help in identifying other victims and potential additional suspects. Cable, identified as a handyman from the Northern California community of San Andreas, was arrested May 22 by Huntington Beach police. He was charged with eight felony counts of poisoning, one felony count of inflicting injury on an elderly person, eight misdemeanour counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and an infraction for consuming alcohol or smoking marijuana while driving. The statement from the district attorney and other law enforcement officials did not specify how the underage person was involved. “The inhumane nature of the crimes combined with targeting a vulnerable population shocks the conscience,” said Huntington Beach Police Chief Robert Handy. “The fact an adult criminal would involve a juvenile is even more reprehensible.” If convicted of all charges, Cable faces up to 19 years and three months in prison. Online jail records show he remained in custody Thursday on USD 500,000 bail with a court date scheduled next month. It was not immediately known if he has an attorney who could comment on his behalf.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-feeds-poison-laced-food-to-homeless-people-in-california-records-their-pain/story-vvv1A2z7Mm0ITOHUytqMmN.html

13-06-2020||India||SC’s virtual hearings can now be accessed from any district court in Delhi||Virtual court hearings in the Supreme Court can now be accessed by lawyers and litigants from any district court in Delhi, according to a circular issued by the top court on Saturday.Until now, this facility was only available at the additional Supreme Court complex situated at Pragati Maidan near the apex court.There are seven district court complexes in the national capital at Rohini, Dwarka, Patiala House, Tis Hazari, Saket, Rouse Avenue and Karkardooma. A video conferencing facility has been established in each of the seven district courts for lawyers and litigants to attend the virtual court hearings at the Supreme Court, the circular said.The move is aimed to benefit the lawyers, litigants or petitioners appearing in person who otherwise had to travel to the Supreme Court for want of video conferencing facilities in their homes or chambers. Anybody intending to avail of this facility has to send an intimation to video.conference@sci.nic.in 24 hours prior to the scheduled hearing. Any complaints with regard to connection or supply of meeting link can be addressed to the helpline number 1881.The facility is the latest among a series of initiatives undertaken by the top court to improve the online court hearing experience. Earlier, the Court had even allowed e-filing of cases and opened chamber blocks for lawyers wishing to attend the virtual court hearings.While lawyers’ bodies have demanded physical court hearings over the virtual proceedings, the Supreme Court is yet to take a call. Hearing of cases through the videoconferencing app called Vidyo has been operational since March this year, ever since the lockdown forced Court to shut. The Court will be breaking for vacation on June 19 and is expected to resume in the first week of July. The CJI along with his colleagues is expected to decide by June end on whether to continue with the present arrangement when the Court reopens or explore the option of physical court hearing.Statistics maintained with the Supreme Court indicate that as on March 1, 2020, the total number of pending cases is 60,469. Several crucial matters pertaining to faith versus rights involving entry of women in Sabarimala, challenge to amendments in Citizenship Act, and petitions challenging scrapping of Article 370 and 35A giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir, are awaiting consideration once the physical hearing in the apex court resumes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-s-virtual-hearings-can-now-be-accessed-from-any-district-court-in-delhi/story-Pnrpar80jn6tngjeBnK03I.html
13-06-2020||India||‘Second income must for an actor’||Varanasi lad Siddharth Arora said actors should do other things as well, besides acting, so that they are not dependent on one income. “With this ongoing going crisis, I feel strongly for a second source of income. This has two advantages: an actor can choose a project which gives him satisfaction, while money can always be earned through the second option,” said the ‘Mukti Bandhan’ and ‘Singhasan Battisi’ actor.An MBA from Banaras Hindu University (BHU), he opened a boutique hotel in his hometown last year. “Due to the lockdown that too is closed and we are in the process of opening it. But, having said that, a second income gives me the liberty to pick up projects of my choice,” he said over the phone.He is also vocal about the payment system in the TV industry. “We are paid three months after the episode is aired. Sometimes that too defaults! I don’t agree with this payment system as it makes it tough for actors to survive. This should be brought down to a maximum of one month. With the current crisis, the situation is even tougher for actors and crew members,” he said.Siddharth has been in Varanasi since Holi. “Vishwanath Baba ‘ke ashirwad se’ (blessings) I was about to go when things started turning bad. So, I stayed back with my parents, brother, his wife and their sweet daughter. We also have two dogs and pigeons. I spent time working out and after the lockdown. I went to BHU for a walk and run. Thankfully things are better here,” he said.The actor was last seen in ‘Laado: Veerpur Ki Mardani’ opposite Avika Gaur and his show ‘Doli Armano Ki’ is having a re-run. “Before the lockdown I was working on a project. We have already shot 50% in Hyderabad. It’s a digital series but I am not allowed to disclose anything. Besides, I am in talks for some TV shows. I have already given my look test with the script and dialogue from Varanasi only,” he said.The actor said the lockdown period has given time for good preparation. “Shooting has stopped but writers are doing their job, casting directors are working so are other departments. I feel this is good for pre-production which will help in the project.”He is in no hurry to go to Mumbai. “I am waiting for clarity and feel that one should stay where they are. “Lockdown has opened but corona has not stopped and is in fact spreading. In Mumbai, I live near Goregaon. Earlier, buildings were getting sealed now floors are being sealed after detection of cases. I don’t think it’s practical to shoot, especially for actors as after make-up they can’t wear masks, gloves and social distancing is challenging.”Recently, he made a film, ‘Tera Shukriya’ that got a good response. “I wrote a poem thanking God for sparing us from sufferings. It was after I was touched by the plight of the migrants and the needy during lockdown. I narrated the poem and took some clipping and stitched everything together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/second-income-must-for-an-actor/story-YK6qDcJmVwL1qOWxNZVBrK.html

The minister of state for external affairs, V Muraldeedharan, also differed on the move.“From June 20, all private chartered flights departing to Kerala from Middle-East countries shall only carry passengers who have been tested for Covid-19 infection and shown to be negative. A test certificate to that effect should be carried by the passenger. It applies to all flights for which consent letters were issued earlier,” said the government order issued by state principal secretary K Elangovan on Friday.Anwar Naha, leader of the Kerala Muslim Cultural Centre, an outfit working among expatriates in the Gulf, said, “It is highly unethical and discriminatory. The government also insists the certificate should be obtained at least 48 hours before the flight. In some countries, it is a tedious process and a costly affair. We have no idea why the government is troubling people who are eager enough to reach their country.”There are least 18 lakh people from the state working in the Gulf. Muraldeedharan said that such conditions will put extra pressure on expatriates. He had earlier locked horns with the state government saying it was more interested in maintaining its records rather than brining back stranded expatriates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-expats-slam-mandatory-test-rule-for-gulf-returnees/story-H5e776dEAbGdtwcRJCCFQO.html

We have placed them under quarantine until their results are out...,” said health minister Vishwajit Rane.He said he has written to Mohanan instructing mass and random testing in areas where cases have been reported from.Covid-19 cases have also been reported from the residential quarters of the Employee State Insurance Corporation, which is located near Goa’s dedicated Covid-19 hospital.

First, the simulation was done and compounds were identified which can fight the virus and stop its spread in the body. Then, we conducted a clinical case study on hundreds of positive patients and we have got 100 per cent favourable results,” Balkrishna said in Haridwar, according to ANI.He said the company is now conducting controlled clinical trials and will release evidence in less than a week.“After taking our medicine, Covid patients recovered in 5-14 days and then tested negative. So, we can say the cure for Covid is possible through Ayurveda. We are performing controlled clinical trials only. In the next 4-5 days, evidence and data will be released by us,” he said.Balakrishna who founded Patanjali along with yoga guru Ramdev, did not say where the controlled clinical trials were being carried out.In late April, the Uttarakhand government approved a fund of Rs 2.48 crore to acquire ayurvedic and homeopathic medicines to boost the immunity of Covid-19 warriors.Balakrishna’s claim of an ayurvedic cure for Covid-19 came on a day when India recorded its highest-ever spike of 11,458 cases, according to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW).India’s Covid-19 tally has soared to 3,08,993 including 1,45,779 active cases.

13-06-2020||India||Foreign ministers of Russia-India-China to hold virtual meeting on June 22||The foreign ministers of Russia, India and China are expected to hold a meeting via video conference on June 22, people familiar with developments said on Saturday, against the backdrop of heightened tensions between New Delhi and Beijing due to a border stand-off.The meeting of the foreign ministers of the RIC (Russia-India-China) grouping is being convened at the initiative of Moscow and is largely focused on enhancing cooperation to tackle the fallout of the global Covid-19 pandemic, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.“The three sides are working on the agenda for the meeting and this is expected to be finalised by early next week,” said a person familiar with planning for the meeting.The people pointed out that the meeting had been in the pipeline for some time and wasn’t in any way linked to the flaring up of tensions between India and China over a weeks-old tense standoff between border troops along the Line of Actual Control, especially in Ladakh sector.This would also be the first meeting to be joined by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi since the stand-off along the LAC became public. Both leaders had joined a virtual meeting of foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on May 13, but at that time the full details of the stand-off hadn’t become public.HT had first reported on violent clashes between Indian and Chinese troops in certain stretches of the LAC on May 10, though the stand-off involving thousands of troops from both sides hadn’t become public at that time.There was no official word from the Indian side regarding the June 22 meeting, which is yet to be formally announced. It was also not clear whether the border stand-off could figure in the discussions, especially since India has clearly said there is no room for intervention by any third party in the matter. The Indian government had made its position clear after US President Donald Trump recently offered to mediate between India and China.The Russian side has repeatedly said in recent days that it hopes India and China will take steps to de-escalate tensions. Moscow’s relations with both New Delhi and Beijing are currently very good, and both Russian ambassador Nikolay Kudashev and deputy chief of mission Roman Babushkin have, in remarks to the Indian media, spoken of the need for easing of tensions for regional stability.Kudashev said Russia is confident that India and China will be guided commitments made by the Indian and Chinese leadership during their two informal summits and work for peace and tranquillity on the border. He also said Russia is looking toward further engagements in the RIC, SCO and Brics (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa) groupings to enhance mutual trust and stability.Babuskin said Russia was “worried” about the situation along the LAC but also confident that India and China will find a way out by using existing mechanisms to handle such issues. He also said a constructive India-China relationship is key to regional stability.India has said it has engaged with China through diplomatic and military channels to find an “early resolution” to the boundary issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-delhi-beijing-border-stand-off-on-agenda-in-russia-india-and-china-s-virtual-meet/story-SfuYcYry9269iUY4BOGDJL.html
13-06-2020||India||A bittersweet goodbye: Chinese girl stuck in India finally left for home||In her sojourn in India, Zhang Aixi experienced both love and hate. But of course, ones who cared for her hugely outnumbered the haters who stupidly blamed her for the Covid-19 outbreak. And they came along with her to the airport to bid her goodbye.“I am taking back a lot of love! I will miss India! This has been a life-changing experience to see such love and compassion,” Zhang told us before leaving for China.The young traveler had found a home away from home at Earth Saviors Foundation in Haryana. Zhang finally left for China on Monday in a special rescue flight.Before coming to Earth Saviors Foundation, Zhang had gone through a very difficult time.Zhang Aixi, daughter of a Chinese industrialist had come to India on a solo trip in January. She was living in a paying guest accommodation in Gurugram. As the government announced a complete lockdown to fight Covid-19, Zhang realised there was no way she could return to China. She lost her touch with her mother, and suffered a mental and emotional breakdown.With anti-Chinese sentiments at peak, Zhang had to encounter a lot of misplaced hate. On one occasion, some miscreants chased her and mocker her by calling her ‘China Virus’.Zhang became severely depression, and also had episodes of aggression. She could get no medical help and she was thrown out of the Gurugram PG.The Gurugram police officials tried finding her a safe place to live but NGOs and shelters were too scared to keep her due to Covid-19 paranoia. Finally, Haryana based NGO, Earth Saviours Foundation, came ahead to provide her shelter. Ravi Kalra, founder of the NGO and his team took very good care of Zhang. She got medical treatment for her nervous breakdown and she recovered quickly in the new atmosphere. Her mental state improved drastically and the residents of the shelter run by the NGO became her family. Zhang formed a deep bond with Kalra and his team. But she terribly missed her mom and longed to meet her.We connected Zhang to Hem Kusum, assistant professor in the Department of Chinese Language and Culture, Visva Bharti University, Santiniketan, West Bengal with whom she would happily talk for hours in her mother tongue.Kalra was constantly in touch with the Chinese Embassy to send Zhang back to China. He arranged Zhang’s meeting with the officials to help her go back to her country.“There were too many procedural hurdles. We lost hope many times. We are thankful to the Government of India, FRRO officers and all other concerned authorities that supported us. We somehow wanted to unite Zhang with her mom and God finally made it happen,” says Kalra.Kalra says what goes around comes around in abundance, sooner or later, so he and his team will keep doing good. “We will never discriminate among human beings. Some people may have hated Zhang for being a Chinese, but for us, she will always be family,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-bittersweet-goodbye-chinese-girl-stuck-in-india-finally-left-for-home/story-IAzBi3gKk2GtDJoFvoO4TO.html

He was initially admitted to an isolation ward, but was moved to a private one when his coronavirus test report came negative.“Governor Lalji Tandon has been running fever for the last few days but he is Covid-19 negative. His report confirms urinary tract infection. He has been advised complete bed rest and is attended by a team of doctors,” said Medanta hospital director Dr Rakesh Kapoor. “Since governor Lalji Tandon is also a diabetic, care is being taken to save him from other infections.”Meanwhile Manohar Lal Dubey, secretary to the MP governor, on Saturday said, “The information that I have is that the governor got himself admitted for some check-up.”Madhya Pradesh Raj Bhavan had reported eleven Covid-19 positive cases till June 9 when Tandon left for Lucknow on a 10-day leave. Tandon reached Lucknow from Bhopal on Tuesday. He is scheduled to return on June 19. Of the 11 coronavirus cases found on MP Raj Bhavan campus, 10 are Raj Bhavan employees and their family members.Earlier on June 9, Dubey had said: “The governor has gone home on a 10-day leave and it has nothing to do with Covid-19 patients found at Raj Bhavan. In fact, the latest patient happens to be a labourer who was engaged in construction work in the Raj Bhavan and he tested positive about a week earlier. The employees who tested positive for coronavirus were shifted to some other place and the Raj Bhavan at present has no presence of any Covid-19 patient.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-governor-lalji-tandon-in-lucknow-hospital-tests-covid-19-negative/story-2Rohu2UOsDXwLwPiUCsQWI.html

While construction and related activities seems to be the major source of livelihood for these migrants, the second largest chunk of people belonged to services that includes cooks, drivers, daily wagers, domestic helps, and tailors.“The skill mapping of 16 lakh migrants has been completed by the government. Out of this 8.40 lakh are construction workers,” said building construction department minister Ashok Chowdhary.“So far 38,874 migrants have been found to be doing the work of a cook, 14,773 as domestic help/child caretaker, more than 30,000 as drivers and 62,270 as tailors,” said principal secretary disaster management department, Pratyaya Amrit.Cooks from Bihar, particularly those from the Mithilanchal region, are in great demand in metros. “From a small village Bhakjari in Benipatti block in Madhubani district, more than 200 people alone work as a cook at different places,” said a government official, not wanting to be quoted.In the construction sector, more than 3.9 lakhs are unskilled workers while more than 1.48 lakh worked as mason’s help. Close to 54,000 belong to a group of mechanics with expertise in different fields, more than 22,000 migrants are from the electronic and electrical field, 15,000 from the computer and IT sector and a sizable number are from banking and financial sectors.Chief minister Nitish Kumar had announced that based on the skill profiling, the state government will reach out to industrial houses to invest in the state and create employment.Till June, 12, 1510 Shramik Special trains arrived in Bihar bringing 21.24 lakh people travelled to the state. Most of the migrants who returned were kept at block level quarantine centres for 14 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bihar-s-skill-mapping-of-its-migrants-construction-activity-tops-list/story-Wd4k1X9RrlLe3ulNQeNv9J.html
13-06-2020||India||Goa’s Covid-19 tally crosses 500 with 60 new cases||The total number of coronavirus positive patients in Goa crossed the 500 mark after 60 new cases were reported over the last 24-hours taking the state’s tally to 523 of whom 454 are active cases, the state health authorities announced on Saturday. The huge rise in the number of people testing positive for coronavirus has led the state government to designate yet another facility as a Covid Care Centre -- the third in a span of six days. The government-owned Colva Tourist Hostel has now been designated as a Covid Care Centre. “We have 60 new cases today of which 26 cases are from Mangor Hill, (the state’s first containment zone), five are travellers into the state and the rest are primary contacts of infected persons,” Health Secretary Nila Mohanan, said. Further complicating matters for the health department, a Covid-19 ‘critical’ patient was ‘dumped’ at the Goa Medical College and Hospital by two persons who later fled from the scene. “We are trying to ascertain who this person is. All we know is that he is from Betim (a village on the northern bank of the Mandovi River, opposite the capital city of Panaji),” Mohanan said. The man who was admitted with Chronic Obstructionary Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and had suffered a heart attack is in a critical condition and has currently been put on a ventilator at the Covid hospital. Until the beginning of June, the ESI Hospital in Margao, a town in South Goa was designated as the sole Covid19 Hospital that treated all patients who were registered as positive -- symptomatic and asymptomatic. Earlier, this week, however, the State administration changed gears and set up a 220-bed Covid Care Centre at a Primary Health Centre in Shiroda in South Goa and quickly followed it up with yet another private hostel being designated for asymptomatic coronavirus positive patients. Symptomatic patients continue to be treated at the ESI Hospital. On June 1, Goa’s Covid-19 tally stood at 73. In the last 13 days, 450 more cases have been reported. Ninety five per cent of the patients remain asymptomatic while there have been no deaths yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-s-covid-19-tally-crosses-500-with-60-new-cases/story-ulqeJRHUASbU8M97CVSyiN.html
13-06-2020||India||Health ministry issues revised clinical management protocols for Covid-19 and spurt in cases||As the number of Covid-19 cases crossed the three lakh-mark, the government on Saturday came out with a revised treatment protocol to deal with the deadly infection, allowing use of antiviral drug Remdesivir in moderate cases and Hydroxychloroquine in patients during the early course of the disease.It also recommended an off-label application of Tocilizumab, a drug that modifies the immune system or its functioning, and convalescent plasma for treating coronavirus-infected patients in moderate stage of the illness, besides adding loss of smell or taste to the list of Covid-19 symptoms.In its revised ‘Clinical Management Protocols for Covid-19’, the Union health ministry, in a turnaround from its earlier decision, advised use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine in the early course of the disease, while dropping the use of azithromycin in combination with HCQ in severe cases and those requiring ICU management. Ten days after recording two lakh Covid-19 cases, India surpassed the three lakh-mark on Saturday with the worst daily spike of 11,458 infections, while the death toll too climbed to 8,884 with 386 new fatalities, according to the Health Ministry.India took 64 days to cross the one lakh-mark from 100 cases, then in another fortnight it reached the grim milestone of two lakh cases. It has now become the fourth worst-hit nation with a caseload of 3,08,993. Only US, Brazil and Russia have more cases.Hydroxychloroquine has demonstrated in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV2 and was shown to be clinically beneficial in several small single-centre studies though with significant limitations, the health ministry said.“Nonetheless, several large observational studies with severe methodologic limitations have shown no effect on mortality or other clinically meaningful outcomes,” the revised document said.“As such, the evidence base behind its use remains limited as with other drugs and should only be used after shared decision making with the patients while awaiting the results of ongoing studies,” it said.As is the case with other antivirals, this drug should be used as early in the disease course as possible to achieve any meaningful effects and should be avoided in patients with severe disease, the health ministry said, adding that an ECG should ideally be done before prescribing the drug.Under emergency use authorisation, Remdesivir may be considered for patients in moderate stage requiring oxygen support. It is not recommended for those with severe renal impairment and high level of liver enzymes, pregnant and lactating women, and those below 12 years, the document stated. The drug, administered in the form of injection, should be given at a dose of 200 mg on day one followed by 100 mg daily for five days.According to the revised protocols, convalescent plasma therapy may be considered for patients with moderate illness with no improvement in condition despite the use of steroids.The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from Covid-19 and transfusing those to a coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.The recipient should be closely monitored for several hours after transfusion for any adverse events and its use should be avoided in patients with immunoglobulin A deficiency or immunoglobulin allergy.“The dose is variable ranging from 4 to 13 ml/kg -- usually 200 ml single dose given slowly over not less than two hours,” the revised document stated. The guidelines state that tocilizumab may be considered in patients with moderate illness with progressive increase in oxygen requirement and in mechanically ventilated patients not improving despite the use of steroids. Long term safety data in Covid-19 remains largely unknown, the guidelines stated.The presence of raised inflammatory markers should be checked before its use and the patient should be carefully monitored after tocilizumab is administered for secondary infections and neutropenia. Active infections and Tuberculosis should be ruled out before use, it stated.For patients with progressive deterioration of oxygenation indicators, rapid worsening on imaging and excessive activation of the body’s inflammatory response, glucocorticoids can be used for a short period of time.Larger dose of glucocorticoids, a class of steroid hormones, will delay the removal of coronavirus due to immunosuppressive effects, the revised document stated.The ministry said that coronavirus-infected patients reporting to various Covid-19 treatment facilities have been reporting symptoms like fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, expectoration, myalgia, rhinorrhea, sore throat and diarrhoea. They have also complained of loss of smell (anosmia) or loss of taste (ageusia) preceding the onset of respiratory symptoms. The ministry said the use of Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and convalescent plasma therapy, at present, is based on limited available evidence. As the situation evolves and when more data become available, the evidence will be accordingly incorporated, and recommendation upgraded, it stated.Meanwhile, the ministry’s data updated at 8 AM on Saturday showed active cases at 1,45,779 and those who have recovered at 1,54,329; one patient has migrated.“Thus, around 49.95 per cent patients have recovered so far,” a ministry official said.The total number of confirmed cases include foreigners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-issues-revised-clinical-management-protocols-for-covid-19-and-spurt-in-cases/story-jokq8akJs7xwvh5PVFaF2O.html
13-06-2020||India||Surge in Goa’s Covid-19 cases traced to infection at this health centre||Amid rise in coronavirus cases across Goa, it has emerged that a health establishment - the Urban Health Centre (UHC) in Vasco da Gama, the state’s port town - is the single source for a bulk of cases in the state. Health authorities first realised they had a problem on their hands when staff members at this health centre began testing positive. It is believed that these health workers were deployed to work in Mangor Hill, a congested locality in the port town of Vasco da Gama, before it was declared as Goa’s first Covid-19 containment zone. Testing within the containment zone was stopped after the workers were found positive and a new team was brought in. Data released by the government has revealed that 24 out of the 34 staff working at the Urban Health Centre in Vasco tested Covid-19 positive which forced the shuttering of the centre. Tests on their family members have also come out positive. To protect themselves, the villages where they come from have gone into ‘self-lockdowns’. A security guard who worked at the UHC in Vasco, in turn, infected three members of his family and five others in the neighbourhood, forcing the authorities to demarcate a zone of restricted movement. At Morlem in Sattari, a village on the eastern frontier with Karnataka and deep within the Western Ghats, 15 persons have contracted the disease that can all be traced to a couple of workers from the village who were posted at the said health centre. It’s a similar story for other villages in Goa - Guleli, Melaulim, Usgao - as well as Canacona in South Goa where cases were found after primary contact of the health workers was tested and found positive. The Health Authorities admitted to the lapse that led to the spread. “Various active cases are of people from people who are working at the Urban Health Centre in Vasco but were from various parts of Goa. Now all of them (health workers) are being put up in hotels and residencies. We are equally concerned as from them it has gone to others across the state. We are trying to mitigate that and see that it doesn’t happen again,” Health Secretary Nila Mohanan said. The health workers were earlier being given the option of returning home at the end of their shifts, a practice that has now been stopped.The statement comes even as more staff members linked to the state health department have tested positive. On Saturday the Health Department conducted tests on all security guards at the Goa Medical College and Hospital, the state’s premier health facility, after a lone security guard working at the facility tested positive, sparking fears that the state’s main hospital too may be carrying the infection.“With reference to a security guard working at GMC who was tested positive, we have conducted swab testing for all the guards and their family members. We have placed them under quarantine until their results are out, as per my discussion with the Collector,” Health Minister Vishwajit Rane said. “I have also written to Secretary Health instructing that we conduct mass/random testing in all the areas where we have a positive case. Our team will ensure such testing is carried out. If required, based on the number of cases, we will declare the said ward as a containment zone,” Rane added. Cases have also sprung up in the quarters of the Employee State Insurance (ESI) Corporation which is in the vicinity of the ESI Hospital which is Goa’s dedicated Covid-19 Hospital. Besides health workers, five drivers of the Kadamba Transport Corporation, the state owned bus service and four postal workers at the Vasco Post Office, have also tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surge-in-goa-s-covid-19-cases-traced-to-infection-at-this-health-centre/story-SxN9nXjPE9qTGQFZOihAKK.html

Amid a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases, there is some relief also as 46 people were cured and discharged from hospitals.Among the new coronavirus cases, 53 are expatriates, 18 came from other states and 10 people got infected from others, his office said adding full lockdown will be in place on Sunday. Currently, the active cases are 1,342, at least 1,045 people have recovered and there have been 20 deaths. The total number of people under observation has risen to 2, 35,000 and the state has 117 containment zones.As more flights are expected from the middle-eastern countries, the worried government has issued an order making a Covid-19-free certificate mandatory for all passengers coming by chartered flights. This has evoked sharp reactions from the expatriate community and opposition parties. “It is a cruel move. The government should withdraw it immediately,” said state opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala.The latest notification came at a time when many organisations working among the expat community in the Gulf arranged chartered flights to reach home as coronavirus cases shot up in some countries. At least, 400 chartered flights are being planned in one-month. They said the move was highly discriminatory as people coming by ‘Vande Bharat’ flights did not need such a certificate. At least, 212 people from the state have died in the Gulf due to Covid-19 in the last two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/85-fresh-covid-19-cases-take-kerala-s-coronavirus-tally-to-2-407/story-eB6xzhvpMOGWhx3EEhkBiI.html

The laboratories can charge up to Rs 2,800 in case of the services like swab collection and delivery reports are given at home.The state’s health minister Rajesh Tope, announced the decision of capping the test price after a committee of senior health department officials submitted its report on the issue. The decision came on a day when Maharashtra’s Covid-19 tally went past 1.04 lakh.Tope said the price of the test in Maharashtra is now lowest in the country. The minister said that in the backdrop of the testing for coronavirus being done in huge numbers and the drop in the prices of the kits used for the test, the decision to reduce the prices of the test was justified. He said that the four-member committee had given its recommendation for the revision in the prices after analysing every aspect related to the cost incurred for the test.“Maharashtra has conducted the highest tests and the count is more than 6.25 lakh tests from 95 testing labs, including 42 private labs, that are operational across the state. The ICMR protocol for the RT-PCR tests remains the same and there would be no compromise on the quality. This has been another decision in the interest of the common public and in the direction of curbing the profiteering,” Tope said.He said that the home test charges too have been brought down to Rs 2,800 from Rs 5,200. Dr Sudhakar Shinde, state health assurance society’s CEO, headed the committee that took all aspects related to the tests into account.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-slashes-covid-19-test-price-by-50-caps-it-at-rs-2-200/story-ytxiS9bUPjevcEcFAZVuCK.html

Mumbai has the capacity to test 12,000 samples per day but only about 4,000 tests are happening,” Fadnavis alleged.“The government is trying to keep the number of Covid-19 positive cases low by testing lesser number of samples,” the former Maharashtra chief minister said.ALSO READ | Maharashtra’s Covid-19 tally swells to 1.4 lakh, 57K of them in MumbaiMaharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope, however, on Saturday said that the state government has reduced the rates of Covid-19 tests conducted by private laboratories from Rs 4,500 to Rs 2,200.The health minister said the lowering of rates for the crucial tests would provide some relief to the common people. “Rs 2,200 will be charged for collecting the swabs through viral transport media (VTM) from hospitals, while it would cost Rs 2,800 for collection of swabs from home. Earlier, the charges were Rs 4,500 and Rs 5,200 respectively,” he said.The revised rates are the maximum these labs can charge. District collectors too, can negotiate with private labs to reduce the rates further, Tope said.“If the private labs charge more than the prescribed upper limit, legal action would be taken against them,” he said, claiming that the new rates will be the lowest in the country.At present, there are 91 labs in Maharashtra for Covid-19 testing and about four to five are also in the offing.Maharashtra, which is the worst-hit state by the coronavirus pandemic, crossed the one lakh-mark on Friday with 3,717 new cases and 127 deaths.

13-06-2020||India||Nearly 90% of Odisha’s Covid-19 cases in 24 hours from quarantine centres||At 225, Odisha on Saturday registered its biggest single-day surge of Covid-19 cases taking the total number to 3,723.Of the total new cases, 196 were reported from quarantine centres while the other 29 were local contacts, said health and family welfare department officials. Cuttack district registered the highest number of cases with 92 followed by Ganjam (20) and Khordha (19). However, with 2,474 persons discharged from various Covid hospitals, the total number of active cases in the state now stands at 1,236. The surge came even as the state government continued to curb movement of people in 11 districts by imposing weekend shutdowns. Beginning this month, the state government has enforced complete shutdown in the districts amid a spike in cases. Odisha was among the first states to impose lockdowns from March. During the lockdown, state police collected a penalty of Rs 1.25 crore from people caught in public places without a face mask While the rising number of positive cases is almost matched by number of recoveries, what is worrying the officials is the rising trend of frontline workers like doctors, nurses and policemen getting infected. On Saturday, two women doctors, working at Narla Community Health Centre of Kalahandi district tested positive for Covid-19, taking the total number of infected doctors in Odisha to 16.Kalahandi district collector Parag Harshad Gavalli said the doctors reportedly contracted the disease after coming in direct contact with a returnee from Telangana. The returnees visited the CHC by breaking home quarantine protocols. Three days ago, chief minister Naveen Patnaik too had raised concerns about more and more healthcare workers getting infected. “I am distressed to note that over the past few weeks there have been instances of healthcare workers getting infected with Covid-19. This points to a probable breach in maintaining infection control practices. I would like to emphasize again that you are the strength of the people in this long war. Please first ensure your safety and the safety of your team,” Patnaik had said.Odisha has already announced ex-gratia of Rs 50 lakh for the next of kin of doctors, nurses and health workers who die of Covid-19 while performing their duties.In Ganjam district, two police personnel too tested positive. Chhatrapur sub divisional police officer and inspector of Chhatrapur police station tested positive. On Friday, a havildar of Motu border check post in Malkangiri district had tested positive for coronavirus.In a related development, a Covid-19 patient who had fled a hospital in Bhubaneswar on Friday, was nabbed by locals. The patient, a 77-year-old man from Bhadrak district had tested positive for Covid-19 at AIIMS Bhubaneswar. While his family members were admitted to the AIIMS, he was shifted to a Covid hospital in Bhubaneswar. While his registration process was underway, the man walked out of the hospital. He was later caught by a few locals at a vegetable market in the city.Meanwhile, the district administration of Ganjam, the Covid hotspot of Odisha, joined three other districts in banning mass congregations for the popular Raja festival, the celebrations of which began on Saturday. Ganjam collector Vijay Amruta Kulange said restrictions would remain in place till June 16.

13-06-2020||India||India says Nepal’s border move ‘violative’, ‘artificial enlargement of claims’||Nepal’s Parliament on Saturday passed a constitutional amendment to give legal backing to a map depicting disputed areas such as Lipulekh as Nepalese territory, prompting India to say such “artificial enlargement of claims” violates an understanding to resolve boundary issues through talks.On Saturday afternoon, the House of Representatives or lower house of Nepal’s Parliament unanimously adopted the constitutional amendment bill for including the country’s new political map in the national emblem. This map, cleared by the KP Sharma Oli government on May 20, depicts Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepal.All 258 members of the 275-strong House of Representatives present in the lower house voted for the bill. The ruling Nepal Communist Party doesn’t have a two-thirds majority in the lower house, and the bill was supported by key opposition parties such as Nepali Congress and Rastriya Prajatantra Party.Also Read: India had offered dialogue to Nepal on row over map. Why PM Oli ignored itThe bill is set to be taken up by the National Assembly or upper house next week, people familiar with developments said. The Nepal Communist Party has a two-thirds majority in the upper house and the bill’s passage by the National Assembly is considered a formality.Reacting to the development, the external affairs ministry – which has said in the past that the matter should be resolved through talks – described the passage of the bill as an “artificial enlargement” of Nepal’s territorial claims.“We have noted that the House of Representatives of Nepal has passed a constitution amendment bill for changing the map of Nepal to include parts of Indian territory. We have already made our position clear on this matter,” said external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava.He added, “This artificial enlargement of claims is not based on historical fact or evidence and is not tenable. It is also violative of our current understanding to hold talks on outstanding boundary issues.”Also Read: Nepal parliament clears new map, shuts possibility of talks on boundary rowNepal’s Speaker Agni Sapkota was quoted by The Kathmandu Post as saying: “All 258 lawmakers present in the meeting voted for the bill, while there was no vote against it. I announce that the bill has been endorsed by more than a two-thirds majority.”When the Nepal government presented the bill in the lower house on Tuesday for discussion, it was unanimously backed by lawmakers from all political parties. After being passed by the upper house, the bill will have to be signed by the president to come into effect.Nepal’s move to issue the new political map was triggered by India’s inauguration of an 80-km road to Lipulekh on the border with Tibet to facilitate the movement of pilgrims going to the Kailash Mansarovar site. Last year, Nepal had been irked when India depicted Kalapani as part of a new map of the union territory of Ladakh.Nepalese officials have said they made three proposals to India for talks since last November, with the most recent one in May, but that there was no response from the Indian side. Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has maintained that Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura are part of his country’s territory on the basis of the Treaty of Sugauli signed with the British in 1816, which says all areas east of the Kali river belong to Nepal.Oli has also accused India of creating an “artificial” boundary in the region and of encroaching on Nepalese territory by deploying the army.India has dismissed these claims, saying they are not based on historical facts and records.Hours before the lower house of Nepal’s Parliament voted on the amendment, Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane emphasised the strong relations between the two countries. The remarks marked a U-turn from his earlier comments about Nepal working at someone else’s behest to raise the border issue.“We have a very strong relationship with Nepal. We have geographical, cultural, historical, religious linkages. We have very strong people-to-people connect. Our relation with them has always been strong and will remain strong in the future,” Naravane told reporters.The India-Nepal border row comes at a time when India is engaged in a tense stand-off with Chinese troops in several sections of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and Constantino Xavier of Brookings India said it was time for New Delhi to move towards de-escalation with Kathmandu.“India spent too many years wasting scarce resources on micro-managing Nepal politics. Useless, counter-productive. Delhi can’t be petty. Ignore symbolic amendment. Olis will come and go. Move on, focus on de-escalation, delivery,” Xavier tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-says-nepal-s-border-move-violative-artificial-enlargement-of-claims/story-twKEXxMOOULzpiK6pVUn7J.html

Most of the health department officials and hospital staff are engaged in tackling Covid-19 as it is spreading fast. But now we will also have to tackle dengue and malaria,” said a senior health official.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had already warned officials to gear up for the challenge. She had particularly stressed on the district of North 24 Parganas. The district has also the third highest number of Covid-19 cases after Kolkata and Howrah. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.“Please carry on the work needed to prevent dengue. Ensure that a situation does not arise later where you have to fight dengue and Covid-19 together,” she had said in April.Every year dengue caused by two species of mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus and malaria caused by Anopheles stephensi take a heavy toll in Kolkata and West Bengal. In 2018 and 2019 around 23,000 and 47,000 people were detected with dengue respectively. More than 180 people have died of dengue in the last five years. Malaria infected more than 75,000 people in the last three years and more than 130 people have died in the last five years. “What could make matters worse is that the symptoms of the three - Covid, dengue and malaria and a few other diseases such as typhoid and common flu often overlap – fever, sore throat and body ache. One should first go for dengue and malaria tests. If found negative they should go for Covid-19 tests and if the fever persists for almost a week then one should go for a typhoid test,” said Amitava Nandi, virologist.The Kolkata Municipal Corporation has already held several meetings at the borough levels and campaigns and public announcements are being made to make the people aware of the situation.“Unlike other years we can’t go inside buildings and people’s houses to check if there is any stagnant water where mosquitoes can breed. So this time we are asking people to check their homes while we check the roads. We have 144 malaria clinics and 15 dengue clinics,” said Debasis Biswas, chief vector control officer of KMC.What has compounded the problem is that because of the lockdown a section of the civic body’s ground level workers have returned home. Trees that had fallen during cyclone Amphan on May 20 in and around Kolkata could now end up increasing the threat of dengue and malaria.“Even though we have cut the trees to clear the roads, not all have been removed and the trunks and branches are still lying on the roadside. Plastic containers and earthen pots could be hidden beneath them. They could become ideal breeding sites for the Aedes aegypti which are small container breeders. The Aedes albopictus, another dengue mosquito which breeds in hollows of trees can also proliferate,” said a KMC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hit-hard-by-covid-19-bengal-braces-for-dengue-malaria-as-monsoon-breaks/story-mVYqWZIbGUHzg1nNflV2eN.html

With this, the number of cases reached 62 till Saturday afternoon. Four people have so far been cured. Till May 22, the Himalayan state, which shares borders with China, Bhutan and Nepal, was coronavirus-free. The next day, a 25-year-old man who returned from Delhi, tested positive for the disease. He has been released from hospital.A meeting of the state task force was held in Gangtok on Friday. It was chaired by chief minister Prem Singh Tamang. He decided to resume classes in schools, colleges and universities only from the first week of August. Earlier, it was decided that the classes from nine and above would resume from July 1.While speaking to HT, Mani Kumar Sharma, Sikkim health minister, said, “Adequate precautions need to be taken before classes resume.”He said the number of cases would slowly decrease as most of the returnees have already been tested.Sikkim has made it mandatory to put all returnees in compulsory quarantine for 14 days before they go for mandatory home quarantine for another 14 days.“All the returnees are being tested and it has become easy for the government to track them. All those who tested positive were asymptomatic and this is dangerous. It is a challenge for us,” said Sharma. The state government has already announced a ban on entry of people from other states and abroad till October. It was among the first states to ban entry of migrant workers and non-residents, including tourists although the latter support Sikkim’s vast tourism industry.So far, more than 6000 Sikkim locals have returned home. Among them, 191 people returned from Mumbai on June 4.Pempa Bhutia, state health secretary, said “No health worker has so far tested positive and the state healthcare infrastructure is adequate enough to deal with the present situation.” “If the number of cases rise the government may face problems,” said Sharma and Bhutia.According to the state health bulletin published on Saturday afternoon, the total number of people tested so far is 5,377.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sikkim-records-spike-in-covid-19-cases-govt-defers-reopening-of-schools/story-WHBUE9frMshYIJu0sPtOeM.html

The newly-formed Save Darjeeling Covid 19 Protection Committee announced the decision on Friday evening.The Committee consists of 16 organisations including Chamber of Commerce Darjeeling, Himalayan Transport Coordination Committee and Path Pasaley Sangh. S N Pradhan, president of HimalayanTransport Coordination Committee who is also one of the three conveners of the newly formed committee said “We have not called a bandh but have appealed all in Darjeeling town falling under Darjeeling Municipality to remain inside homes and not to open business establishments and ply vehicles for seven days till June 21.”The decision according to Pradhan was taken after reaching a conclusion that social distancing has not been followed practically. “The only way to save oneself and others is to remain in self isolation and thus we have decided to keep close all business establishments and transport after two-day-long deliberations,” he said.As on June 12, Darjeeling district has recorded 184 Covid-19 cases, three of whom have died.Mira Baraily, secretary, Path Pasaley Sangh, Darjeeling said, “The call to remain inside homes is not against anyone and it is also not against the National Disaster Act.

Transport, both public and private would also be closed for the period.”Bimal Mintri, vice president, Chamber of Commerce Darjeeling said “We have taken a unanimous decision to keep everything other than essential commodities closed for a week on a trial basis.” The Darjeeling hills had witnessed 104-day-long bandh during 2017 agitation for the creation of a separate state of Gorkhaland. S Poonambalam, district magistrate of Darjeeling said “We will sit with the organisations on Saturday evening and listen to their grievances.”As the Covid 19 cases are on the rise particularly in Siliguri plains of Darjeeling district, the district administration has already closed the fish market at Siliguri Regulated Market for a week from Friday.

13-06-2020||India||Covid-19 bites IMA’s passing out parade, no kin of new officers allowed||For the first time since its inception, a batch of young offices graduated from the Indian Military Academy (IMA) in Dehradun on Saturday without their parents watching the passing out parade (POP) due to restrictions for the Covid-19 pandemic.Instead, the academy’s officers and their wives played the role of parents for the Gentlemen Cadets (GCs) by putting stars on their shoulders as a symbol of getting commissioned as army officers. The changes were introduced considering the precautionary measures as per the guidelines of government for Covid-19 pandemic. The IMA officials said that it was done to ensure the safety of the GCs and the academy staff. In the morning, when the event started, the GCs in the POP wore masks and maintained extra distance than usual during the ceremonial parade. There was no shower of rose petals from helicopters on the GCs which have become a tradition to welcome the young officers into the army. There were also some first-time changes during the Pipping ceremony which happens after the parade is over. The ceremony comprises taking the oath by the GCs and then putting the stars of their ranks on their shoulders by their family members. But since family members were not allowed to attend the event, the IMA staffers and their wives played the role of their parents by putting the stars on their shoulders. The whole event was live streamed through a drone camera which was used for the first time. The venue of the ceremony was also changed from the ground near Khetarpal Gymnasium to the one near Nizam Pavilion of the Academy. Some of the GCs at the event were quite emotional as their parents couldn’t witness them becoming officers in the army but said the void was filled by their instructors and IMA officials from the Indian Army. Twenty-four-year-old Abhishek Negi, a newly commissioned officer from Dehradun said, “Obviously it felt bad that my parents couldn’t see me wearing the officer’s uniform despite living in the same city. But then, it is for the safety of all. We are thankful for our instructors at the academy who played the role of our parents and made us realise once again, that we all are one big family.”Samrat Thapa, 22, another newly commissioned officer from Bhopal, said his father cried over the phone while speaking to him after the ceremony.“My father, who is a serving Colonel in the Indian Army, wanted me to see passing out as an army officer with flying colours. Unfortunately, due to obvious reasons he couldn’t come and cried over the phone when I called him after the ceremony. I consoled him asking him not to cry as from now onwards I will also be wearing the uniform like him,” said Thapa. The IMA officials and their wives who played the roles of the GCs’ parents said they were more than proud of the role they played. “I felt extremely proud while putting the stars on the shoulders of these young officers along with my husband. We are all one family,” said Sumati Gakhar, wife of an Indian Army officer, also an IMA official. Saturday’s ceremony also witnessed a significant change with the introduction of ‘Pahla Kadam’ or first step, a symbolic stair in the Pipping ceremony. Lt Col Amit Dagar, public relation officer while speaking on the introduction of Pahla Kadam said, “Earlier, there was Antim Pag or last step after the parade which symbolises the conclusion of training, but from this season we introduced Pahla Kadam after Antim Pag which symbolises the first step of the new officers in their army careers after completing the training.”This time, the newly commissioned officers also didn’t get their leave to go home before joining their respective units. They will join their units right away.“All these changes were introduced due to the ongoing pandemic in the country as we wanted to ensure the health safety of the GCs, their family members as well as the IMA staffers,” said Lt Col Dagar.A total of 423 GCs passed out of the academy including 333 from India and 90 from friendly foreign countries. The coveted award of Sword of Honour was awarded to GC Akashdeep Singh Dhillon of Punjab. The gold medal for the GC standing first in the Order of Merit was awarded to GC Shiv Kumar Singh Chauhan while the silver and bronze medals went to Sakshyam Rana and Suraj Singh respectively. Doan Van Son from Vietnam was awarded silver medal for the GC standing First in the Order of Merit among foreign GCs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-bites-ima-s-passing-out-parade-no-kin-of-new-officers-allowed/story-qpvbzjpwGMx4C0Vc34FTeP.html

The BJP leaders from all parts of the Jammu division and the office-bearers of the Valley have been asked to remain present in their offices and certain designated places in a bid to listen to Singh’s speech live. BJP office-bearers said that the minister’s speech would start at 11 am and is likely to go on for an hour. Altaf Thakur, BJP spokesperson, J&K, said Sunday’s virtual rally would be the first big party event addressed by a senior leader since the lockdown restrictions were imposed in the union territory.“The virtual rally is going to be attended by hundreds of BJP leaders from the Jammu division and the office-bearers from the Kashmir Valley. On June 28, a similar rally will be held for the BJP workers in the Kashmir Valley. It will be addressed by another senior BJP leader,” Thakur said.“The defence minister will address party workers on Covid-19 and other important matters. All the workers are eagerly waiting for his speech. The audio and video output of the speech will be made available at BJP offices and other designated locations,” he added.Surinder Ambardar, a former lawmaker and senior BJP leader, said all prominent leaders have been asked to reach the party office in Jammu on Sunday morning. “We’re expecting some important message in the minister’s speech. We hope the speech will centre on Covid-19 and other key issues pertaining to J&K,” Ambardar said.“Only BJP leaders and workers are active during the lockdown restrictions,” said a senior office-bearer of the party from south Kashmir. He said party leaders and workers are strictly adhering to social distancing norms.Virtual rallies could become a new reality in the country until the pandemic abates, he added.Earlier, former J&K chief minister and National Conference (NC) vice-president Omar Abdullah had addressed a meeting of party leaders in the Jammu division via Zoom application after he was released from detention in March after eight months of house arrest post the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-to-address-virtual-rally-for-bjp-workers-in-jammu-tomorrow/story-RgJcJE2jTvQSfIHOvhChVL.html
13-06-2020||India||Locked down in Kashi: Foreigners’ tryst with ghats comes to a halt||The raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak has been a dampener for itinerant foreigners, who are attracted to Varanasi, a melting pot of pristine Indian culture and traditions.Varanasi, one of the four oldest living cities, including Rome, Athens, and Jerusalem, in the world, is known for its iconic ghats -- steps leading to the banks of the Ganges river -- serpentine lanes and by-lanes celebrating the mysticism of Hinduism.This is what had attracted Sarah Wackernell, an Austrian national and a social worker, to Varanasi on March 20. She had chalked out elaborate plans to soak in the sights and sounds of the ancient city upon her visit.Alas! Her plans remained a non-starter amid the viral outbreak that led to a day-long “Janta Curfew” on March 22, which was a precursor to the nationwide lockdown restrictions that were enforced three days later to contain the pandemic.Wackernell remained cooped up in her room at a guesthouse in a narrow lane near Rana Mahal Ghat for over 70 days during the lockdown restrictions. There was a sameness to her daily routine during the lockdown, when the hustle and bustle of the ancient city, which is never known to go to sleep, came to a standstill.In the morning, she would sit on the staircase at her doorstep and stare at the empty lane in front of her guesthouse as the pandemic-scarred world went by, while she would spend hours on the rooftop at night and gaze at the benign sheltering sky.“All my plans were dashed because of the lockdown restrictions. I had no option but to be confined to my room at the guesthouse. However, local people and the guesthouse owner and his family were all very kind to me. They took care of me during the lockdown restrictions and are doing so even now,” she said.The viral outbreak hasn’t ebbed her wanderlust. She wants to explore Varanasi and wants to keep her tryst with iconic ghats and mystic dingy by-lanes, as and when an opportunity arises, as the social distancing norms have made these places off-limits for now.She will decamp to Rishikesh in neighbouring Uttarakhand once she has a fill of Varanasi.Ryan G, an American national, who, too, arrived in Varanasi and got stranded because of the lockdown restrictions, however, doesn’t share the same experience as that of Wackernell.He alleged that the police were selective in enforcing lockdown restrictions, as they discriminated between locals and foreigners. “We’re asked by the police to stay inside the guesthouse. However, I saw several locals were roaming on the streets in violation of the lockdown restrictions,” the American tourist alleged.His only attempt to visit the ghats was thwarted by the police, he further alleged.While Nita C, a Dutch national, who arrived in Varanasi four days before the lockdown restrictions were imposed, had a mixed experience.“The locals are very cooperative. They helped us. But the guesthouse staff wasn’t supportive. I was asked to cough up an unreasonable price for four chapatis,” she said.Nita whiled away her time during the lockdown by immersing herself in yoga and meditation sessions daily. She is planning to leave for Delhi soon amid the easing of lockdown restrictions.Spaniard Virginia Tolls, too, reached Varanasi a few days before the lockdown. She had a pleasant experience with her stay. “Locals people are good. They did shopping for me, as I couldn’t venture out of the guesthouse during the lockdown,” she said, while she’s still undecided when she would like to leave Varanasi.Portuguese tourist Alexandre Afonso made good use of the downtime because of the lockdown restrictions. “Personally speaking, it was a life-altering experience for me, as I could indulge in an inner journey to explore who I’m. I may have been born and brought up in Portugal, but I’m a global citizen,” he said.Afonso, who too missed visiting the ghats, one of Varanasi’s star attractions, blamed a section of guesthouse owners for many tourists’ unpleasant stay during the lockdown restrictions.Kirtiman Srivastava, regional tourism officer, Uttar Pradesh tourism, made the ground rules clear.“Owners of hotels, lodges, and guesthouses were clearly instructed to take care of foreigners and provide them with good food during the lockdown restrictions.

13-06-2020||India||Loss of smell, taste are now key symptoms to identify Covid-19 patients: Health Ministry||The Centre has added two new symptoms of the infectious Covid-19 disease, for the reference of medical professionals to help in detecting Covid-19 positive patients. Loss of smell (anosmia) and loss of taste (ageusia) have been added to the list of coronavirus symptoms by the Union Health Ministry.The other symptoms of the disease are fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, expectoration, sore throat and diarrhoea.When the first set of criteria for Covid-19 testing was fixed in January 2020, it comprised fever, cough, and breathlessness as symptoms. Later, in May with a surge in Covid-19 positive cases, gastrointestinal health issues such as diarrhoea or vomiting were also added.ALSO READ | Loss of smell, taste may be added to Covid-19 test criteriaThere are currently 13 clinical symptoms and signs in the specimen referral form that was revised by the ministry last month. The symptoms are fever, cough, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, breathlessness, nausea, haemoptysis (coughing up of blood), body ache, sore throat, chest pain, nasal discharge and sputum. Any patient with one or more symptoms is allowed to get tested for Covid-19. If loss of smell and taste are added to the list, a patient would have to report one or more of 15 symptoms to get tested.The Health Ministry in its document has indicated that direct person-to-person transmission occurs only through close contact, mainly through droplets that are released when the infected person either coughs, sneezes or talks to another person.“These droplets may also land on surfaces, where the virus remains viable. Infection can also occur if a person touches an infected surface and then touches his or her eyes, nose or mouth,” the document states.Earlier, during the onset of the disease, several cases were reported where the patients showed a loss of smell or taste.In April, the World Health Organization (WHO), along with many European Union (EU) countries, the USA, and Australia, added the loss of smell and taste as one of the crucial Covid-19 symptoms. The United Kingdom also added these to its list of Covid-19 symptom on May 18.Senior citizens, those who are over 60 years of age are particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus. Among them, those with co-morbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiac disease, are also at high risk, according to the Health Ministry. So clarity on symptoms of the new disease will not only help doctors in treating coronavirus patients but also expanding the eligibility criteria will help in identifying potential Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/loss-of-smell-taste-are-now-key-symptoms-to-identify-covid-19-patients-health-ministry/story-8Mo5vphGzqKbx5XeSkNHaP.html

Many others were given the task of visiting various other project sites like Dummugudem, Gouravelli, Yellampalli Sridpada Sagar project, Upper Manair dam, Devadula project and Bhimpalli project.However, the police took into custody several leaders even before they could visit the project sites and confined them to the guest houses.CLP leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka was placed under house arrest at Wyra in Khammam district, while PCC working president A Revanth Reddy was not allowed to come out of his residence in Jubilee Hills in Hyderabad with the police placing vehicles all around his house. Jagga Reddy, J Kusum Kumar and Vamshichand Reddy were also placed under house arrest in Hyderabad.Jeevan Reddy was arrested in Jagityal on his way to Tummidihatti, while Ponnam Prabhakar was stopped at the Sircilla Congress party office. Only Sampath Kumar managed to reach Gouravelli reservoir before being arrested.Bhadrachalam MLA Podem Veeraiah was also arrested on his way to Sitaramasagar project while Mulug MLA Anasuya alias Seethakka was placed under house arrest in Mulugu.Speaking to reporters in Hyderabad in the afternoon, PCC chief Uttam Kumar Reddy alleged that the TRS government was unleashing a reign of terror in the state and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao was cheating the state with false claims and hollow promises.Describing KCR’s claims on irrigation projects as lies, the PCC chief said the Congress leaders were planning to visit the project sites only to expose the government’s claims. “We are not being allowed to visit any project site on the pretext of Covid-19 pandemic, though we were going there individually by strictly following the Covid-19 guidelines,” he said.He reminded that on June 2, too, the police had arrested several Congress leaders who were planning to visit irrigation projects on Krishna river. “The KCR government has ignored the projects already started by the previous Congress governments and took up new ones in the name of redesigning only for the sake of kickbacks,” Reddy alleged.The PCC chief alleged that some police officials were being used by the TRS leaders to suppress the opposition. “We never expected that democracy would be trampled upon in the new state of Telangana,” he said.He sought to know why the police had remained silent when the chief minister, his son K T Rama Rao and other ministers were openly holding meetings in violation of Covid-19 guidelines. “Why are they stalling only the Congress leaders despite our assurance that we would strictly maintain social distance and follow other rules?” he asked.The PCC chief said he would raise the matter with Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan and also with the Centre regarding the state police actions. “We shall also fight a legal battle against the state government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-congress-leaders-in-house-arrest-visit-to-project-sites-scuttled/story-8gQe2vjtmqpwW4zmu0OhRM.html

And when the locks of the bag were broken, police found two laptops, 19 mobile phones, 33 pen drives, 4 hard disks and packets of condoms. When the hard disks were checked many objectionable videos were found,” said the police official.On Thursday, a woman, along with her sister-in-law had gone to the monk to seek his blessings. He later called the victim to visit him alone and allegedly raped.Tension had gripped the area after area after the monk was taken to the local police station.The accused monk has been identified as Acharya Sukumal Nandi (38), native of Jodhpur. Nandi was staying in a Jain shelter home in Mohannagar locality of the Hindaun town. “On Thursday, the victim had gone to the shelter home with her husband and sister-in-law to take blessings from the monk. Initially, the survivor’s sister-in-law entered the room and the monk tried to molest her but she moved out immediately. When she herself went to the room, she was allegedly raped by Nandi who threatened her by saying that he would harm her family members using his powers if she spoke about it,” said Lakshman Gaur, deputy inspector general of police (DIGP) Bharatpur range.The victim told the family members about the incident after which they reached the monk’s place but the accused had locked himself inside his room after which police were called to the spot.“On Friday, the statement of the victim and her sister-in-law were recorded before the court after which Nandi was arrested. He has been sent to judicial custody for 15-days. A case against him was registered under Section 354 (assaulting woman) and 376 (rape) of Indain Penal Code.

The order was passed on June 11 but made available on Saturday.The Delhi government also told the court that a total of 569 ventilators were available, out of which 315 were being utilised and remaining are available.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.“Considering the gravity of the situation, we hereby direct the respondents (Centre and Delhi government) to increase the number of the beds for Cocid-19 patients and also try to increase the number of ventilators so that all Covid patients in need can get these facilities,” the bench said in its order, according to PTI.The Delhi government had recently faced flak with complaints that patients were not being admitted as many hospitals claimed that there were no beds available. The high court also said it expects all hospitals in the national capital to correctly upload the availability of real-time bed capacity data so that the public may know in advance where to go if they are suffering from Covid-19.The court’s order came while disposing a plea by several lawyers seeking proper implementation of containment guidelines and to ensure availability of adequate number of hospital beds for Covid-19 patients in DelhiThe Chief Minister’s office in a tweet on Friday night said that out of a total of 9,558 beds 5,361 were occupied and 4.197 were vacant.

It turned out to be a lot in Assam’s Darrang district as a Covid-19 patient was discharged from hospital instead of a recovered person due to confusion over their similar-sounding names.Officials on Saturday said the incident occurred two days ago when authorities of the Mangaldoi Civil Hospital were calling out the names of 14 recovered people for their release.The Covid-19 patient responded to a name sounding similar to his, which was in fact of a recovered person from his Dalgaon Sialmari village. He was then discharged instead, they said.But the hospital authorities quickly realised their mistake and sent an ambulance to bring the Covid-19 patient back to the medical establishment the same night, the officials said.The patient fortunately tested negative for Covid-19 in a test conducted on Friday and was discharged along with the person in whose place he was released earlier, they said.Hospital authorities said that the mistake was caused due to similar-sounding names of the two persons and also because their faces were concealed by masks.Darrang Deputy Commissioner Dilip Kumar Bora has ordered an inquiry into the incident and declared the mistakenly discharged person’s house a containment zone.Swab samples of his family members have been collected and sent for tests.Assam has reported over 3,600 Covid-19 cases so far, of which over 2,000 are active, Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said. Eight persons have died of Covid-19 in the state so far. Of them, four succumbed to the disease this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-patient-replies-to-similar-name-discharged-ambulance-brings-him-back/story-DHm1ib1XdOZO1enQC9uNKK.html

The pact will allow these companies to manufacture remdesivir for distribution in 127 countries, which consist of nearly all low-income and lower-middle-income countries, as well as several upper-middle- and high-income countries that face significant obstacles to healthcare access.The licenses are royalty-free until the World Health Organization (WHO) declares the end of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern status for Covid-19 or until an alternative drug or vaccine is approved against the fatal respiratory disease, whichever is earlier.The nine companies, under the licensing agreements, have the right to receive a technology transfer of the Gilead manufacturing process for remdesivir which will enable them to scale up production more quickly, as well as set their own prices for their products.Remdesivir has received emergency use authorisation (EUA) in the US, India and a few other countries for the treatment of Covid-19 after preliminary results from two trials, including one by US’ National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, showed some promise.However, the safety and efficacy of remdesivir to treat Covid-19 are still being evaluated in multiple Phase 3 clinical trials that are underway. Remdesivir is also part of WHO’s Solidarity Trial which is underway across the world, including at over half a dozen sites in India.The Drug Controller General of India had on June 1 granted the marketing authorisation to Gilead Sciences’ anti-viral drug remdesivir injection 5 mg/mL and Remdesivir lyophilised powder for injection 100 mg for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe disease.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dr-reddy-s-biocon-s-syngene-among-4-more-firms-in-pact-with-gilead-for-covid-19-drug-remdesivir/story-fHJs7x6Lj7yhEwsPYfPOkJ.html

13-06-2020||India||Community transmission of Covid-19 on in many parts of India, ICMR survey not reflective of current reality: Experts||Amid a massive spurt in coronavirus cases in India, experts on Saturday came down hard on the ICMR for its sero-survey findings to assert that there was no community transmission of Covid-19, saying it was not reflective of the current situation and the government was showing “obstinacy” in accepting the truth.Emphasising that community transmission was on in many parts of the country, the experts asked the government to admit it so that people don’t get complacent.The assertion by experts from the field of virology, public health and medicine came after Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Director General Balram Bhargava at a media briefing on Thursday said that India is definitely not in the community transmission stage of Covid-19 spread while releasing the findings of the survey.India’s first sero-survey to monitor the trend of coronavirus infection transmission found that 0.73 per cent of the 26,400 people surveyed from about 65 districts were exposed to coronavirus.AIIMS former director Dr M C Mishra said there is no doubt that there has been community transmission in several parts of the country.“With the mass exodus and the country unlocking, it has become more rapid and the disease has reached areas where there were no cases. It is high time the government comes to fore and acknowledges it so that people become more alert and do not become complacent,” Mishra told PTI.Talking about the ICMR sero-survey, he said the sample size of around 26,400 people is quite inadequate to capture the scale of the spread of the infection, especially keeping in mind the large population and the diversity of the country.Leading virologist Shahid Jameel said India reached the community transmission stage a long time ago.  “It’s just that the health authorities are not admitting it. Even ICMR’s own study of SARI (severe acute respiratory illness) showed that about 40 per cent of those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 did not have any history of overseas travel or contact to a known case. If this is not community transmission, what is,” said Jameel. CEO of Wellcome Trust/Department of Biotechnology’s India Alliance and best known for his extensive research in Hepatitis E virus and HIV, Jameel said an important point to consider is the sensitivity and specificity of the test that ICMR has not revealed, and even a one percent change would make a big difference in the results in areas of low prevalence.Noted lung surgeon Dr Arvind Kumar said that even if the ICMR argument is accepted, it cannot be denied that community transmission is happening in places like Delhi, Ahmedabad and Mumbai.“India is a vast country and every state is experiencing the virus differently and peaking at different times,” said Kumar, who works at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital here.“The antibodies take two weeks to develop so the survey is reflective of April. In April, we were in the best possible state. Based on a study representing the April situation, saying that we are not in community transmission is a wrong statement,” he told PTI. Chairman of one of the empowered groups set up to deal with the pandemic and NITI Aayog member Dr V K Paul had said the results of the survey indicate the situation of the country around April 30 as the study was conducted mostly around third week of May and antibodies against an infection take around 15 days to develop.While the sero-survey to estimate the fraction of population infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the general population has been completed, the survey in containment zones of hotspot cities is ongoing.India’s Covid-19 tally breached the three-lakh mark on Saturday with a record single-day spike of 11,458 infections, while the death toll rose to 8,884 with 386 new fatalities, the Union Health Ministry said. With a Covid-19 caseload of 3,08,993, India is now the fourth worst-hit nation by the pandemic. The ICMR is doing a study of containment areas and that study will throw up much higher numbers that are likely to fall in the criteria of community transmission, Paul added.          Dr Ravi Shekhar Jha, Head of the Department, Pulmonology, Fortis Escorts Faridabad, said he strongly feels that community transmission has occurred.         “The government  has stopped contact tracing. Earlier the government was doing rigorous contact tracing, but in the last 7-10 days no government, in Delhi or anywhere, is doing it. They know community transmission is happening, but are not accepting it,” Jha told PTI.       On sero-survey, he said it has been done in places where there were not many cases and it should have been carried out in Dharawi or Delhi.  If these surveys are not done in proper places then there is no point in doing it, he said.“It (survey) is definitely not reflective of the current situation. In the end of April we were in a reasonably good position anyways,” he said.Dr Vikas Bajpai, assistant professor, Centre for Social Medicine and Community health at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, said if the government has decided that “obstinacy and blindness to truth” is going to be a matter of policy for it in fighting against this Covid-19 pandemic then it is pointless to try and make them see reason.  “Community transmission is a stage when you are not able to track down the source of infection of a positive case despite thorough contact tracing. Then it is presumed that the virus is in general being transmitted in the community,” he said.Hitting out at ICMR, he said it has mentioned that the study does not include data from the containment zones and the spread of the virus was not uniform everywhere. So if you exclude the most active areas of transmission which are the containment ones obviously the prevalence rate you will arrive at will not reflect the reality, Bajpai added.Dr Manoj Goel, Director and Head, Pulmonology, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurugram, said it would not be right to believe that there is community transmission at the national-level, but it is definitely happening in certain cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad.The ICMR sero-survey found that lockdown and containment measures were successful in preventing rapid spread of the disease, but a large proportion of the population still remains susceptible.Bhargava had said the study surveyed a total of 83 districts with 26,400 people enrolling for it and 28,595 households were visited.  The surveyed districts were categorised into -- zero cases, low incidence, medium incidence and high incidence--- and were selected based on incidence of reported Covid-19 cases as on April 25.         The findings shared with the media stated that data from 65 districts has been compiled till now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/community-transmission-of-covid-19-on-in-many-parts-of-india-icmr-survey-not-reflective-of-current-reality-experts/story-LZZbgWBIMvLgs3JZQvsYNL.html
13-06-2020||India||Rain, thunderstorm in Delhi, UP and Haryana in next 2 hours: IMD||The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday predicted thunderstorm accompanied with rain and wind over a few places in southwest and west Delhi and several areas of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. In an update issued at 12:15pm, the weather department said thunderstorm with rain and wind would occur over and adjoining areas of UP’s Aligarh and Kasganj during the next two hours.The same weather condition will also be seen in Haryana’s Rewari, Bawal, Manesar, Gurugram, Rohtak, Bhiwadi, Nuh, Sohna, Palwal, Faridabad and Ballabhgarh, it said.K Sathi Devi, the head of the national weather forecasting centre, had said earlier that parts of northwest India will get thunderstorms over the weekend. “This is because moisture-laden easterly winds are blowing over northwest India and a western disturbance is also impacting the region. So intermittent thundershowers can be expected for the next two to three days,” she added.According to IMD on Friday, the monsoon has surged and covered the entire Bay of Bengal, northeast India, some parts of Arabian Sea, Goa and parts of Maharashtra under the influence of a low-pressure area lying over the Odisha coast.It said that conditions are favourable for the monsoon to advance into many other parts of Maharashtra, including Mumbai, in the next 48 hours. It will also enter West Bengal and Odisha. “The monsoon has strengthened its pace because of the low-pressure system which developed over the Bay of Bengal. In fact, by early next week, it will enter Gujarat, covering many parts of central India. This system has helped the monsoon move at its normal pace. It’s too early for us to tell if monsoon will arrive over Delhi on its normal date, June 27,” Devi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-and-thunderstorm-in-delhi-uttar-pradesh-and-haryana-in-next-2-hours-imd/story-NZyofIq6O55JH3WYUWTAeI.html

We have geographical, cultural, historical, religious linkages. We have very strong people-to-people connect. Our relation with them has always been strong and will remain strong in the future,” General Naravane said.Officials said General Naravane’s comment appeared to hint India’s stance on Nepal’s effort to expand its territory, one that gives Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s government a silent treatment but continues to build and cement people-to-people ties.ALSO WATCH | At least 1 Indian killed after Nepal police fire near border area with BiharPM Oli is expected to give a constitution amendment bill that formalises the new map a final push at a special sitting of Parliament’s lower house on Saturday afternoon. Diplomatic sources told Hindustan Times that the bill is expected to be passed later this evening, possibly around 5.30 pm.There appeared to be support for the bill in parliament earlier this week when 83 lawmakers discussed the legislation to incorporate the new map in Nepal’s national emblem. Lawmakers were given 72 hours to move amendments to the constitution amendment bill before the lower house votes on it. The 72-hour period ended Friday evening.Rather than wait for the next working day to put the bill to vote, PM Oli requested parliament to hold a special sitting on Saturday - a weekly holiday in Nepal. Only one amendment has been proposed by a lawmaker who opposed the new map but there are reports in local media that she is being pressured to withdraw it.PM Oli’s anxiety to rush the bill through the lower house at a special sitting has been seen to signal his determination to get parliament’s seal of approval and a disregard for New Delhi’s views on the boundary row that he has created.New Delhi has also been upset at how PM Oli had escalated a difference over Lipulekh Pass to score brownie points with Beijing and serve his domestic political interests.PM Oli’s move to jump start the row over Nepal’s map is seen as an effort to consolidate his support within the ruling Communist Party of Nepal by whipping up ultra-nationalistic sentiments in the country. And turn India into a dartboard.PM Oli had last month come up with the map barely 10 days after India upgraded a trail to Lipulekh Pass into a metalled road for pilgrims to Kailash Mansarovar. Nepal contended that the 80-km road passes through its territory though it did not reflect in its map.The new map shows a sliver of land - including Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani - jutting out from the northwestern tip of Nepal.New Delhi promptly rejected the map, calling it a “unilateral act” that was not based on historical facts or evidence.This week, PM Oli’s government started to fix this gap and set up a 9-member team to collect historical facts and evidence to back its claim about these territories, according to The Kathmandu Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-nepal-preps-to-vote-on-new-map-a-hint-about-india-s-stance-from-army-chief/story-VBmlrBLU8bBes0tpnYnCbJ.html

Lagan Kishore was detained.“My son and I were at the border to meet my daughter-in-law (a Nepali national). Security personnel from that side hit my son. They asked me to shut up when I asked why did they do that. They called up 10 more security personnel, they came to the border and fired bullets in the air,” Lagan Kishore was quoted as saying by ANI.“We ran to return to India when they started firing but they dragged me from the Indian side, hit me with a rifle butt and took me to Nepal’s Sangrampur,” Kishore said.“They told me to confess that I was brought there from Nepal. I told them you can kill me but I was brought there from India,” he added.Kumar Rajesh Chandra, the director general of the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), had said the firing incident took place around 8.40am on Friday in Nepalese territory when members of a family, some of whom reside in Nepal were meeting near the border.“The Nepal APF objected (to them being there) saying there is a lockdown in Nepal till June 14, leading to some avoidable and instant altercation. Nepal APF has said that villagers became aggressive and they had to open 15 rounds of fire. This is being investigated,” Chandra said on Friday.The free movement of people between India had Nepal stopped over the past three months due to the coronavirus pandemic and Nepal APF has increased the number of posts to stop Indians from entering its territory.Only those on a list shared by local administrations from both sides were allowed to travel to and fro; cargo movement was also allowed.Yadav and the two others who were injured were not in the list of persons shared by the local administrations, another official who asked not to be named said on Friday. They were accompanied by others from their village and stones were thrown at the APF, an official said citing preliminary reports.“Nepal APF has informed us that the villagers tried to snatch weapons from them but there will be an enquiry by them and by us also. As of now, everything is peaceful and locals have been told not to violate the lockdown imposed by Nepal,” the official said.It was the third such incident in the last one month on the border when Nepal’s police force has fired to disperse people, particularly after India started easing its nationwide lockdown, an official, who asked not to be named, said.Nepal has announced a lockdown in the border region till June 14.Both the countries are locked in a dispute over territory following a map issued by Nepal that stakes claim over Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura. India’s ministry of external affairs said: “such artificial enlargement of territorial claims will not be accepted by India”.India has said these were part of Uttarakhand while Kathmandu had shown them as part of western Nepal in its recent map.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-man-released-by-nepal-after-firing-incident-report/story-nzpGLWzxdXR4OT3Jf4cvtK.html

The event witnessed flouting of social distancing norms, leading to a chaotic situation.The union minister was not present during the programme.A video of the crowd, wherein people were seen jostling with one another to take the food grains packets from ex-MLA Sudarshan Gupta in Banganga area and other BJP workers, went viral on social media.Also read: 5 students booked in MP for social media post on Union minister Narendra Singh TomarThe programme was organised to distribute packets of food grains among 2,000 needy families. During the chaotic situation, people were seen snatching the packets from those distributing it and running away. ‘Looto, ration looto,’ (steal the ration) is what could be heard in the video clip.Congress was quick to attack the BJP over the incident. State Congress leader KK Mishra said, “When the entire country is facing a grave crisis due to coronavirus and hundreds of people have died from the disease, is this the right time for the BJP workers to celebrate the birthday of any leader? The fact is the incident exposed the real face of the BJP which is hardly concerned about people.”State BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “The BJP didn’t organise the programme.” In a clarification, ex-MLA Sudarshan Gupta said, “Our workers organised the programme to distribute food grains. Social distancing norms were followed. Circles were marked every four feet. Tokens were distributed among those who were supposed to receive the packets. There was a problem for some time when some people, who didn’t have tokens, entered the crowd and created disturbances but our workers controlled the situation.

Our investigation also revealed a scam of Rs 150 crore in purchase of medicines, medical kits, furniture and other items. Accordingly, we made these arrests,” the ACB Joint Director said.Earlier as soon as Atchannaidu was taken away from his house, TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu termed it as an “attack on the backward classes”, saying the former minister, who belonged to the community, was in the forefront “exposing the misdeeds” of the Jagan Mohan Reddy-led YSR Congress government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-ap-minister-k-atchannaidu-5-others-arrested-in-employees-state-insurance-scam/story-Npa0D7e8RyTi7aO4jdFzjI.html

13-06-2020||India||Ashok Gehlot hits out at BJP on ‘poaching’ attempt||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday said that a complaint has been lodged with special operations group (SOG) to probe alleged attempts to topple the state government by poaching Congress legislators through money transfers.Hitting out at the Bharatiya Janata Party, the opposition party in the state, the CM said at a press conference, “In Rajasthan, if the BJP leaders are making calls to Congress and independent MLAs, what should we call it,” in an apparent reference to the toppling of Congress governments in Karnataka and then Madhya Pradesh.This has come after Congress chief whip in the state assembly Mahesh Joshi filed a complaint with the anti-corruption bureau on Wednesday, seeking action against those allegedly trying to topple the government.Reacting to deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot’s statement that he had not received any complaint of horse trading, Gehlot said, “I am the leader of the house and the chief minister and if something has been learnt, it would have come from a source. How can this be disclosed?”Hitting out the BJP of indulging in politics amid the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic, Gehlot said, “They toppled the government in Madhya Pradesh and now something similar is being planned in Rajasthan. They (BJP) are exposed in public.”Meanwhile, state Congress president Pilot said the party has a comfortable mandate to win two of the three seats in the Rajya Sabha elections. “Both the party candidates will win and there is no doubt on this,” he said.Congress spokesperson and the Rajasthan observer for Rajya Sabha elections Randeep Surjewala said, “There is no compulsion on any legislators and they all want to stay together. If someone comes to your house to commit theft then you will safeguard your house from thieves. If thieves are coming to steal democracy then it is our responsibility to protect democracy.”BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said, “The horse trading word is used by Congress and they have such history. People connect with BJP for its ideology. Congress leaders have lost faith in their leadership, and the party is blaming BJP for this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashok-gehlot-hits-out-at-bjp-on-poaching-attempt/story-fsNjXwPSUreyeh19qOGV2I.html

13-06-2020||India||Fresh parota at restaurant attracts 5% GST, tax rate jumps to 18% if sold frozen||Plain rotis or parotas (types of Indian flatbreads) is treated as a staple diet of common people and attract 5% tax, but they will attract an 18% levy if sold in the frozen form, a senior government official said. “Plain roti or parota served in a restaurant or provided in takeaway get same treatment in [tax] rates and attract 5% GST [Goods and Services Tax] only,” the person said requesting anonymity.He was commenting on a decision by Authority for Advance Ruling (AAR), Karnataka that frozen and preserved wheat parotas and malabar parotas with a shelf life of three to seven days are not plain ‘rotis’ but a distinct product that would attract 18% GST.The finance ministry declined comments on this matter.The official said frozen parota is preserved, sealed packed and branded. It is sold at a premium and it is not a staple item. It is consumed by the affluent class that could afford to pay tax.“Even items like cheaper biscuits, pastries, cakes, etc., also attract GST at the rate of 18%. Frozen food would be more comparable to such item. Frozen foods cannot be comparable to plain roti or plain parota served in restaurants or taken as staple food, or eaten by poor on day-to-day basis,” the official said.The AAR ruling is area and product specific. A poor person staple food like plain roti cannot be treated at par with a packed product or a frozen parota, he said.This order does not decide the tax rate of ordinary plain parota. “The ordinary or any parota, served for consumption by a restaurant, or a take away, would attract 5% GST rate just like plain roti,” he added.“The AAR (Karnataka) held that such frozen and preserved parota would not be entitled to concessional rate as available to roti (plain roti, khakra attracts 5% GST rate). It has been held that frozen and preserved parota would attract GST at the rate of 18%,” he said.The matter was earlier discussed in the 37th meeting of the GST Council. The Council did not recommend to reduce GST rate on “frozen” and “preserved” parota for the reasoning that these parota are sold by organised sector, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-parota-at-restaurant-attracts-5-gst-tax-rate-jumps-to-18-if-sold-frozen/story-ru5EAiZ6eIiNRzwBYWSn5L.html

On May 22, the state exempted all the factories registered under the Factories Act, from the provisions of Section 51 (weekly hours) and Section 54 (daily hours), till August 21 subject to certain conditions.“Whereas, having examined the provisions further, the Government of Karnataka now intends to withdraw the said notification,” the state government in a fresh notification dated June 11 said. It said, “Therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 5 of Factories Act, 1948 (Act No.63 of 1948), the Government of Karnataka hereby withdraws the Notification dated 22-05-2020 with immediate effect.” According to the Karnataka Employers’ Association, a petition was filed in the High Court challenging the May 22 notification as “illegal, arbitrary and in violation” of Section 5 of the Factories Act which permits exemption from any of the provisions of the Factories Act only in case of `Public Emergencies’.During the course of hearing on June 11 an observation was made by the HC, that it may have to quash the notification unless the government clarifies as to what is the ‘Public Emergency’ involved to enhance the working hours by exempting some provisions of the Factories Act, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-withdraws-order-extending-factory-work-hours/story-xNfG5bfBk6C8znV7ZGPUhJ.html

13-06-2020||India||Supreme Court tells private airlines to give refunds for cancellations||The Supreme Court on Friday asked private airlines to find a way out to refund the air fare of passengers whose flights were cancelled during the lockdown, along with the ministry of civil aviation.Most airlines had placed passengers in a Credit Shell by which they could avail the travel on the same sector within the next seven months to one year. A non-profit organisation, Pravasi Legal Cell, filed a petition in the top court saying that passengers did not intend to avail of the Credit Shell within the stipulated period and should be given a full refund. The bench of Justices Ashok Bhusha, SK Kaul and MR Shah said, “The credit facility that you grant must be for at least two years and passengers should be allowed to avail it across all sectors.” In response, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that the airlines ought to make full refund to passengers. Senior advocate Harish Salve appearing for Spicejet sought to be added in the matter as he felt that a full refund was impossible. “We are having zero revenue and our global earnings have been hugely hit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-tells-private-airlines-to-give-refunds-for-cancellations/story-rQolnR1QwH116YFeHima2I.html
13-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India crossed 300,000 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases on Friday, ending the day with 309,324 cases, of which 146,292 are active. Thus far, 154,150 have recovered from the disease, and 8,882 have died. There are only three other countries that have more cases than India, Russia, Brazil and the US. India ended June 2 with 207,112 cases so its last 100,000 cases were added in 10 days.These numbers shouldn’t worry anyone; in the absence of widespread (and indiscriminate) testing, they are also irrelevant. Many of the cases recorded are of asymptomatic people (a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research based on 40,000 patients put the proportion at 28%); and many other patients who are infected suffer mild symptoms and recover without hospitalization. Some require hospitalization; a few of these, critical care and ventilator support; and 2.85% of those infected, succumb to the disease. On Thursday, India added 11,199 cases according to the HT dashboard. This is the most the country has added in a 24-hour period. Again, this number is largely irrelevant. But the break-up isn’t. Here’s why: reports of the coronavirus disease across the world tell us that the disease ravages densely populated urban centres, spreading rapidly through communities, with no apparent source of infection, and overwhelming health systems. If that sounds familiar, it’s because this is exactly what’s happening in Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu or, more specifically, Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai right now. On Thursday, the three states accounted for 66% of all new cases reported in the country. This means that Thursday’s spike did not happen because of an emerging wave in a hitherto unaffected or less affected part of the country, but was driven by higher numbers in the three states. Over the seven-day period from last Friday (June 5) to Thursday (June 11), these three states accounted for 55%, 53%, 53%, 54%, 52%, 61%, and 66% of daily new cases. And within Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, the cities of Mumbai and Chennai account for the most new cases — on Thursday, for instance, Mumbai accounted for 1,540 of the 3,607 new cases Maharashtra added, and Chennai, 1,407 of the 1,857 Tamil Nadu did. The health systems of the three cities (and the states) have been overwhelmed or are on their way to being overwhelmed. Still, with these three cities accounting for a significant proportion of cases, India has the opportunity of aggressively strengthening their health capacities to manage the coming peak of the infection. If it can manage the situation in Delhi, Mumbai (and Maharashtra) and Chennai (and Tamil Nadu), it would have addressed half (maybe even more) of the problem. Meanwhile, there are lessons from all three states that should be applied universally across India. These are simplicity personified (when put down in black and white) but no country or city has got it right so far. One, test and trace. Two, define clear quarantine and isolation protocols, the last especially for people with mild cases of the disease (otherwise they will take up valuable hospital space). Three, set up dedicated Covid-19 facilities and prevent Covid and non-Covid patients from being in the same space. Four, train health-care workers on safety protocols and protect them (all three states, but especially Delhi and Maharashtra, have done poorly on this front). Five, get the staffing of health care workers right -- both Mumbai and Delhi may or may not have adequate beds, but they are definitely facing a pinch when it comes to health care workers. Six, plan for the worst and procure the requisite health-care equipment (including medical devices) early. Seven, do not confuse hospitals, health care workers, and the public with hundreds of orders. Eight, work out an effective patient admission and transfer system. And nine, draft and implement a painless cremation/burial protocol. There is still time to prepare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-1ZWBASXO0hUeZIRsWTzF0H.html
13-06-2020||India||With composure, determination, 97-year-old from Agra beats Covid-19||GC Gupta, 97, a retired civil engineer from the city of the Taj Mahal, survived the coronavirus disease and has been lionised as an example by the administration for other senior citizens to follow. Gupta was discharged from Nayati Hospital on June 10 after 12 days of treatment. He was admitted in the hospital on May 29 with breathing difficulty and a kidney infection. He tested positive for Covid-19 on May 30. An executive at the hospital credited Gupta’s recovery to his sheer determination to defeat the coronavirus.“ He exhibited no signs of nervousness and rather being worried for himself, was more concerned about his family undergoing quarantine. He remained calm and composed and made things easy for doctors treating him,” added this person who asked not to be named. Gupta’s son Arun Kumar said his father has always been a man with strong will.Gupta served in the irrigation department of Uttar Pradesh and retired in 1973. Arun Kumar said his father is a vegetarian, a teetotaller and into meditation. “He remains on basic medication and is regular with his multi-vitamins, a tablet each for urine trouble and blood pressure beside that for thinning the blood. An early riser, he gets up at 3.30am for meditation and loves watching television to keep himself appraised of the latest in the world,” said Arun Kumar, 65.Covid-19 cases in Agra crossed the 1,000 mark on Wednesday night when the city had recorded an overall of 1,008 positive cases till date, which is highest in state of Uttar Pradesh. It was Agra which had the state’s first five positive cases, on March 2.Agra has seen 56 Covid-related deaths but has a good cure rate of 84%, with 840 patients already having been discharged after being cured. On March 30, an elderly couple from Kerala, aged 93 and 88, who had tested positive and remained critical for days, were reported to have recovered completely. The duo had caught the infection from their son who came down from Italy, the state government had said in a press release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-composure-determination-97-year-old-from-agra-beats-covid-19/story-BJFmOFFpHK8RVuBHI7oSGI.html
13-06-2020||India||‘Beauty of old Lucknow, charms & mesmerises all’||Actor Tina Bhatiya who was last seen in ‘Gully boy’ and TV shows like ‘Pyaar ke Papad’ and ‘Kyuki Jeena Isi ka Naam Hai,’ is more than elated to share screen space with none other than Amitabh Bachchan.“Like many out there I too have been a diehard fan of Amitabh sir and wanted to work with him in any capacity. When I was offered this film by Soojit (Sirkar) sir, I was glad to bag the role but had not thought in my wildest dream that it I will get to work with Amitabh sir. I got to know about this only when the entire star cast finally met.” A National School of Drama (NSD) alumna, she has been a theatre person throughout. “I’m out and out a theatre person. For me being on stage is a feeling of being alive as an actor. Besides acting, I have also directed a play based on three stories from legendry writer Harishankar Parsai that has done multiple shows till date. After NSD, I took up theatre and then TV. Thereafter, from Delhi, I moved to Mumbai and theatre kept me all occupied till I bagged a role in ‘Gully Boy.’ I consider myself lucky to have worked with makers like Zoya Akhtar and Soojit sir, in the beginning of my career in films.”Talking about her role in ‘Gulabo Sitaboo,’ she said, “I play ‘Dulahin’ who is a care taker at ‘Fatima Mahal’ and lives with her husband and child. Working with such a cast and makers gave me immense happiness. Soojit sir is from theatre background and his idea of film-making is very similar to theatre. Amitabh sir is such pleasure to work with; you get to learn so much from him when he is on the sets. Getting to work with young superstars like Ranveer Singh and Ayushmann Khurrana was a great feeling too as they are truly humble and know their craft so well. The best part was when Ayushmann recognised me as ‘choti ammi’ from ‘Gully Boy’.”Sharing her experience of shooting in city of nawabs, “I have been to Lucknow for a play before and knew the place all well. But shooting here for a film was an altogether a different experience. The beauty of old Lucknow, charms and mesmerises all. You feel you are in another world altogether. I love the places we shot in specially that palace and those narrow lane buildings which have numerous stories to tell. Also, the people and markets are so cool. You feel you are in another world.” Tina regrets that due to ongoing crisis the film couldn’t get theatrical release. “The crisis has affected us all especially our work but I and husband, actor Boloram Das, made a good use of the time and shot a short film, ‘Conditions Apply’ where we acted, directed and released the film last week. We used the time to the fullest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/beauty-of-old-lucknow-charms-mesmerises-all/story-qvgqJKCrKVAoDhdHC8ctQK.html
13-06-2020||India||1 lakh cases in Mumbai by June-end?||With the state crossing the mark of one lakh Covid cases on Friday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is bracing for a similar scenario by the end of the month. While the civic body said the city may not necessarily touch the mark by June-end, it is ramping up medical infrastructure to handle one lakh cases, of which 58,000 are expected to be active. According to BMC officials, if there is no sharp rise in the number of cases reported daily, the count could be 75,000 to 80,000 by the end of the month. On Friday, Mumbai reported 1,366 cases, taking the count to 55,451, of which 28,248 cases were active. Of the new cases, 29 were in Dharavi, taking the total of the area to 2,013 and toll to 77. Ninety new deaths took the city’s toll to 2,044.BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal said, “By the end of June, we will be prepared to handle one lakh cases, of which 58,299 are likely to be active. However, it is not correct to say we will have that many cases by June-end, but we will be prepared to handle this load, if it comes.”To handle such a spike, the civic body will have to double the number of existing ICUs, oxygen beds and ventilator units. BMC data shows that of the 26,897 active cases on June 10, 1,152 are occupying ICU beds, 3,905 oxygen beds, followed by 483 ventilators. The occupancy of ICU beds is 99%, oxygen beds is 75% and ventilators is 95%. “We are looking at double the number of cases, from the current 54,000, so the facilities will also have to be doubled,” said a BMC official. “By the end of the month, BMC plans to set up 1,700 ICU beds from the current capacity of 1,163.”The civic body has 5,200 oxygen beds as of June 10 and plans to set up more than 9,000 by the end of the month. Officials said the capacity will be increased by co-opting more private and even smaller hospitals and expanding the existing field facilities. “Currently, 483 of the 507 ventilators are occupied. This also means that 1.79 per cent of the total 26,897 patients need ventilators. By this logic, by month end, if we are preparing for 58,000 active cases, we should have at least 850 ventilators,” added the official.The presumption is that over 39,000 patients would have recovered by June-end, up from the current figure of 24,209. The estimate is that of the 58,000 active cases, 26,000 will be asymptomatic and 19,000 patients will be treated in Covid centres and hospitals followed by nearly 3,000 in ICU and 10,000 in home quarantine. However, another BMC official said, “The exact trend will be known by June 23 or June 25, by when the impact of relaxations of lockdown will be fully felt.”Dr Ramesh Yadav, a private health consultant, said, “BMC should also consider that several congested areas in the city have been breeding grounds for seasonal infections such as malaria, dengue and typhoid. We should also prepare for a number of other viral infections, along with Covid-19, with the onset of the monsoon.”Meanwhile, 2,42,923 tests have been conducted in Mumbai so far and BMC has traced 9.91 lakh high- and low-risk contacts, as of June 10. BMC has screened 76.84 lakh citizens, including 3.27 lakh senior citizens.Moreover, citizens can now get updates about the waiting period or availability of slots at crematoriums on BMC’s helpline 1916. The civic body in a statement on Friday said citizens can avail real-time updates, which will be obtained from the control room.BMC also issued a statement that Tata Memorial Hospital in Parel has so far treated 176 patients suffering from both Covid-19 and cancer at the NSCI Dome Corona Centre in Worli. Of them, 126 have recovered and no deaths have been reported so far.Also, with the rise in cases, six areas in P-N ward, which covers Malad, have been declared restricted zones, where only essential shops can remain open. According to BMC data, as of June 11, there are 1,683 cases in P-N ward.Daksha Patel, local BJP corporator from Malad, said, “Areas such as Kokani Pada, Pimpri Pada, Appa Pada, Kranti Nagar, Shivaji Nagar and Tanaji Nagar that have a huge slum cover have been declared restricted zones. This is expected to bring down the number of cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-lakh-cases-in-mumbai-by-june-end/story-h2AgFbqZmFbRqD6s6l8xbI.html
13-06-2020||India||Chinese diplomat tweets a twist to Ladakh standoff, sees link to Article 370||The spokesman of the Chinese embassy in Pakistan created a flutter in diplomatic circles by appearing to suggest the standoff between Indian and Chinese border troops was linked to New Delhi’s decision to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status last year.Wang Xianfeng, whose Twitter bio describes him as press officer at the Chinese mission in Islamabad, included in his tweet a link to an article by a scholar from an influential think tank affiliated with China’s ministry of state security or main intelligence agency, which also suggested a connection between the border tensions and the change in Kashmir’s status.“India’s actions of unilaterally changing the status quo of Kashmir and continuing to exacerbate regional tensions have posed a challenge to the sovereignty of China and Pakistan and made the India-Pakistan relations and China-India relations more complex,” Wang tweeted.People familiar with developments said Wang is responsible for liaising with the Pakistani media. Though the tweet could represent his personal opinion, this is the first time a Chinese official has sought to link the border standoff with the change in Kashmir’s status, including the creation of the union territory of Ladakh, which particularly angered China.India and China are currently engaged through diplomatic and military channels for an “early resolution” of the border standoff after what Indian officials have described as a “limited military disengagement” along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, the focus of the tensions.When India scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status on August 5 last year, the Chinese foreign ministry had issued two statements criticising the development, including one that focused on the splitting of the state into union territories.This statement, while urging India to be “cautious” on the border issue and to avoid “actions that further complicate the border issue”, said: “China has always opposed India’s inclusion of Chinese territory in India’s administrative jurisdiction in the western part of the Sino-Indian border.” This was a reference to the area in Ladakh that New Delhi claims but is controlled by Beijing.Wang’s tweet linked to the article by scholar Wang Shida of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, which began by saying India had since last August “taken constant actions to unilaterally change the status quo of Kashmir and continued to exacerbate regional tensions”.The article, titled “India blinded by ‘double confidence’”, said India’s move to change the status quo in Kashmir “constitutes a serious threat to regional peace” and “posed a challenge to the sovereignty of Pakistan and China”.“On the Chinese side, India ‘opened up new territory on the map’, incorporated part of the areas under the local jurisdiction of Xinjiang and Tibet into its Ladakh union territory, and placed Pakistani-administered Kashmir within its so-called union territories of Jammu and Kashmir,” the article said.“This forced China into the Kashmir dispute, stimulated China and Pakistan to take counter-actions on the Kashmir issue, and dramatically increased the difficulty in resolving the border issue between China and India,” it added.The article noted that China’s foreign minister Wang Yi had conveyed his country’s position on these issues to external affairs minister S Jaishankar when he visited Beijing last year – that “India’s moves challenged China’s sovereign rights and interests and violated the agreement on maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas between the two countries”.At the time, Jaishankar had informed the Chinese side that India’s action was a purely internal matter with no consequences for the country’s external boundaries.Amitabh Mathur, a former special secretary in the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), questioned the timing of the Chinese official’s tweet and said it underscored the complex issues involved in the ongoing standoff.“It seems as if the Chinese are leaning on us and the situation isn’t as simple as some are making it out to be. It’s also strange that such a tweet emanated from a Chinese official in Islamabad. There is a Pakistani connection to it and it’s almost as if the Chinese are trying to reassure the Pakistanis,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-diplomat-links-ladakh-standoff-to-scrapped-art-370-creates-a-flutter/story-Jn0zkpbBFql6pcsdfKe82K.html
13-06-2020||India||In tune with Centre’s plans, Delhi, Maharashtra, TN say will not reimpose restrictions||India may have added over 100,000 new cases of coronavirus disease in the past 10 days but there are no plans to impose a stringent nationwide lockdown again, top officials involved in managing the pandemic said on Friday. Their comments came even as the three states worst hit by the pandemic, Maharashtra, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu, ruled out any reimposition of lockdown measures. After 68 days of a nationwide lockdown, India is now in a phased exit from restrictions on movement and businesses, a period the home ministry terms Unlock 1.0. On Friday, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said that the lockdown will not be reimposed in Delhi. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray too ruled out re-imposing a hard lockdown. And the Tamil Nadu government told the Madras High Court that there are no plans to impose a complete lockdown either in Chennai or the rest of the state. There has been buzz on social media that all three states could see a reimposition of the lockdown because of the spiraling cases. On Thursday, India registered 11,199 cases, the highest ever on a single day till then. Of this, 66% of the cases came from the three states. On Friday night, out of India’s total cases of 309,324, the three states accounted for 178,663. Central government officials too, insisted that there is little possibility of any immediate roll back of concessions. They, however, added that if the states collectively raise such a demand, then the Centre might consider reviewing its approach. “But as of now, there is no discussion to review the current guidelines,” said one official who asked not to be named. They also point out that states have enough power to declare containment zones and take measures to curb the spread of the disease in hot spots. Maharashtra chief minister Thackeray said the government was easing the lockdown restrictions in phases to restart the economy. “Some television news channels and social media platforms are speaking about lockdown being reimposed and closure of all shops (in the state). But the government has not taken any such decision,” he added in a statement.Union government officials said there is no proposal as of now to discontinue economic activities as it may hamper livelihood of millions of Indians.“We already have a huge issue in hand on how to help the millions of migrant workers who have returned to their villages,” added a second official who asked not to be namedAnd far from asking for a reimposition of the lockdown, some states want more activities to be opened up, the first official said. “Some have asked for more relaxation such as opening of suburban and metro trains and more public transport.”  “We are easing lockdown restrictions in phases to restart the economy. But lifting of restrictions does not mean unnecessary crowding and violating discipline of physical distancing and hygiene,” Thackeray said.A third official said on condition of anonymity that states can, if they so desire “ even extend lockdown.” On May 31, a day after the Centre announced significant relaxations under “Unlock 1”, the Maharashtra government had extended the lockdown till June 30, but announced a slew of relaxations and phase-wise resumption of activities. All markets, market areas and shops, except malls, were allowed to reopen in the state from June 5 on the odd- even basis in non-containment zones.The state also allowed private offices to operate with up to 10% of their employee strength as per the requirement from June 8.(with inputs from Delhi and Mumbai bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-tune-with-centre-s-plans-delhi-maharashtra-tn-say-will-not-reimpose-restrictions/story-7CXwS1WDrmmZhNlCtfOBnM.html
13-06-2020||India||Over 2,000 new Covid-19 cases in Delhi, deaths up by 129||New coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infections crossed the 2,000 mark for the first time in Delhi and the death toll rose by 129, according to the Delhi government’s health bulletin on Friday that showed both numbers to be at their highest for a single day.The national capital now has 36,824 cases – up by 2,137 from the day before – and 1,214 deaths, which translates into a case fatality rate of 3.3%. The latest cases came from 5,947 samples, a test confirmation rate of nearly 36%. This proportion was up by one percentage point from a day earlier, after having rise close to 5 percentage points for two days before that. Across the country, there have been 309,324 cases – less than half of which are active – and 8,882 deaths. The average case fatality ratio comes to 2.9% nationally.The steady increase in numbers comes during a week when the city has opened up considerably, and the state government began unprecedented preparations to add 100,000 beds in makeshift hospitals in stadiums and community halls.Experts said the spike is to be expected. “This is the nature of the disease, it will spread. But, there is no need to panic unnecessarily. Even if we assume a low number of 10% of the population getting the infection, it still means 20 lakh people will get infected in Delhi with a population of two crore.However, most of the infections will be mild. Our focus now has to be on not creating panic but ensuring people who need treatment, get it,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department on community medicine at Safdarjung hospital. “People should observe all safety measures like washing their hands frequently and wearing a mask in public,” he added, urging for precautions to be taken.Delhi’s lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Friday constituted a high-level expert committee which includes ICMR director general Balram Bhargava to suggest effective steps to deal with the pandemic. According to the bulletin 58 of the deaths added to the tally were confirmed after a review. The city’s chief secretary put in place a new standard operating procedure requiring all hospitals to report their Covid-19 death to the integrated disease surveillance programme by 5pm every evening. In the one month it took for the city’s mortality rate to increase three-fold, the number of cases increased almost five-fold.The health bulletin data shows there are 22,212 active cases or those living with the infection. Of these, 24% people are admitted to city hospitals. This is the first time the number of people hospitalised with Covid-19 in the city has crossed the 5,000 mark. A second expert added that the trends suggest there is community transmission of the disease, when the source of infections cannot be traced. “Currently, there is a rising trend in the number of Covid-19 cases. There is definitely community transmission otherwise how can so many cases be reported in a city in one day? Now, all that the government can do is test people and isolate them so that they do not spread the infection to other susceptible people,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at AIIMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-2-000-new-cases-in-delhi-deaths-up-by-129/story-nkFwioKEWmy5pxmNXX3gyJ.html
13-06-2020||India||Fewer deaths in Mar-May this year versus 2019: Delhi civic bodies||Delhi’s three municipal bodies have reported 36% fewer deaths in March, April and May this year according to data given by the municipalities. According to data accessed by Hindustan Times from the corporations, the three civic bodies recorded 28,170 deaths between March and May in 2019. However, in the corresponding period this year, the agencies recorded around 10,000 fewer deaths —17,902, according to the corporation’s records. This number includes those who succumbed to the coronavirus disease, a number the state government put at 1,214 on Friday, as against the 2,098 claimed by the municipal bodies. The three corporations recorded 9,396 deaths in March 2019, and 8,718 this year — a difference of just 678. In March 2020, the North corporation recorded 3,702 deaths as against 4,359 last year.The South and East corporations recorded 3, 232 and 1,784 deaths in March 2020 respectively. In March 2019, the South body reported 3,508 deaths and the East corporation’s tally stood at 1,529.However, Delhi was under lockdown from March 22, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi had declared a janta curfew. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had ordered a week-long lockdown later that evening, and on March 24, the Prime Minister declared a nationwide lockdown. In effect, Delhi was locked down for 10 days in March, and then for all of April and May.April this year, for instance, saw nearly half the number of deaths as April last year, 4127 as against 9498. Last April, the North body registered 3,891 deaths, the east body registered 2,085, and the South body added 3,522. This April, the North body recorded 2,079 deaths, the East one 668 and the South body 1,380. The agencies’ records saw deaths drop by nearly 45% in May this year. While there were 5,057 deaths in May this year, last year saw 9,276. Civic officials said one reason for the sharp drop in reported deaths may be the nationwide lockdown itself. They said there were fewer road accident fatalities due to the lockdown, as well as fewer institutional deaths of people from outside Delhi, and a drop in food poisoning, water and vector-borne diseases.Delhi traffic police data shows that between March 25 and May 27 this year, 39 fatal accidents were reported in the national capital, whereas before the lockdown from January 1 to March 25, there were 294 fatal accidents. Traffic police estimates also show that before the lockdown, between 120 and 150 fatal road accidents were reported in the city every month on average .“As people were not allowed to step out, there were very few road accidents. Deaths due to road accidents account for around 25% to 30% of the total deaths recorded in Delhi,” said Jai Prakash, standing committee chairperson, North Delhi Municipal Corporation.He added, “Initially, out-patient departments in hospitals were also suspended, and non-Covid patients were not being admitted, so deaths were not reported from that section too. The number is low due to all these factors.”With interstate movement into the Capital restricted for a considerable period, the number of patients coming from other parts of the country also saw a decline.Dr PK Sharma, a former municipal health officer at the New Delhi Municipal Council and an epidemiologist, said, “Those who die in Delhi, irrespective of the state they belonged to, are issued death certificates by civic agencies here. Due to the lockdown, there were fewer people who came to Delhi for treatment. This is also a reason why the civic agencies reported fewer deaths during the lockdown. As people were restricted to their homes, deaths due to food poisoning or gastroenteritis, water-borne and vector-borne diseases could have registered a dip.” “Fewer deaths were reported in 2020, between the months of March and May as compared to the same period in 2019. This is because traffic movement was completely restricted during the nationwide lockdown, so the number of deaths due to accidents was almost negligible in this period. We issue certificates only against deaths which are registered with us, and it is possible that some may not have been registered with us,” an SDMC official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fewer-deaths-in-mar-may-this-year-versus-2019-delhi-mcds/story-N7V5fUp7hRhMRvXXVeZ6bI.html
13-06-2020||India||Supreme Court is concerned over dip in Covid-19 testing figures||The Supreme Court on Friday expressed concern about the decline in the testing numbers for Covid-19 in the national capital.“We have noticed that the Government App of Delhi (Delhi Corona app) itself indicates that the testing of Covid-19 patients has gone down in the month of June as compared to the month of May,” the court stated in its order in a suo motu (on its own) case.It also drew a comparison with two other states, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, which, it pointed out, were testing far more. “On May 27, 2020, the number of samples tested is 6,018, on June 9 the number is 4,670, on June 11 the total testing in Delhi is reported as 5,077 whereas in the State of Maharashtra it is 16,000 and in the State of Tamil Nadu it is 17675,” the order said.To be sure, with 277,246 tests done till Friday, Delhi has conducted 14,003 tests per million of its population, higher than Tamil Nadu’s 8,902 and Maharashtra’s 7,600. Delhi’s population, at 20 million is also much lower than Maharashtra’s 122 million and Tamil Nadu’s 75 million. “We do not understand why the tests have gone down in state of NCT [national capital territory] Delhi. Non-testing of the patients is not a solution to the problem rather increase in the testing facility is the duty of the state, so that people may come to know about their health status regarding Covid-19 and they may take appropriate care and treatment of Covid-19,” the order said.The top court made it clear that non-testing of suspected patients is not a solution to the problem and testing numbers should be increasing considering the fact the number of patients is on the rise. States should ensure that there should be steep increase in the testing both by government hospitals and private labs and whoever desires to get tested should not be denied the same on any technical or any other ground.“The States may consider simplifying the procedure so that more and more tests be held to benefit the patients,” the court added in its order.The court also pulled hospitals across the country for the insensitive manner in which they were treating Covid-19 patients and the bodies of the victims, while issuing notices to the Centre and five states — Delhi, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-is-concerned-over-dip-in-testing-figures/story-HysGvMuVvjjt0Q87fRAGYM.html
13-06-2020||India||Treatment of the dead in Covid-19 hospitals deplorable: Supreme Court||An angry Supreme Court on Friday rebuked states and hospitals across the country for the callous and insensitive manner in which they were treating coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients and the bodies of those who had fallen victim to the disease, issuing notices to the central government and five states — Delhi, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat — in a suo motu (on its own) case initiated by the apex court.It was especially harsh on the Delhi government and the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) hospital in the city-state, referring to the condition of patients in the hospital as “pathetic”and its wards as “deplorable” . “The duty of the state of NCT Delhi does not end in informing the people that it has arranged 5,814 beds in government hospitals and 9,535 beds including private hospitals. The state and its officers are duty-bound to ensure that patients are taken care (of)... and hospitals have necessary infrastructure and staff,” it said in its order. A Delhi government spokesperson said the administration accepted the Supreme Court’s observations with utmost respect and with absolute sincerity. “The Delhi government is determined to provide health care for all and to ensure best possible treatment to each Covid-19 patient. But if there are any gaps that still remain and is brought to our notice, we will act on them sincerely and immediately.”The spokesperson said it was an extraordinary situation and the Delhi government was trying its best. “The front line workers in our hospitals, our doctors and nursing staff, are working day and night to serve the people...”A three-judge bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan asked the five states to submit detailed status reports on the government hospitals treating Covid-19-infected people, patient care and details of the staff and infrastructure in the hospitals before June 17, when the case will be taken up next for hearing. “Covid-19 patients are treated worse than animals. In one case, a dead body was found in garbage,” the bench, which also comprised justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MR Shah, remarked during the hearing of the case.The Supreme Court registered on Thursday the suo motu case over issues surrounding the treatment of Covid-19 patients and handling of the bodies of Covid-19 victims in hospitals. Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde took cognisance of media reports highlighting the issue and assigned the matter to the three-judge bench.“We direct that the chief secretaries of the states shall immediately take appropriate notice of the status of patients’ management in the government hospital in their respective states and take remedial action. Status reports with regard to government hospitals, patient care and the details of the staff, infrastructure, etc. should be brought before the court so that appropriate directions can be issued by the court as found necessary on the next date of hearing,” the order passed by the court said.The bench also expressed concern over reduced testing of samples in the national capital and described the situation in Delhi as “horrific”.LNJP hospital is a dedicated Covid hospital with 2,000 beds out which only 870 beds are occupied.“The patients are in the wards and the dead bodies are also in the same wards. Dead bodies are seen also in the lobby and waiting area. The patients were not supplied with any oxygen support or any other support, no saline drips were shown with the beds and there was no one to attend the patients. Patients are crying and there is no one to attend to them,” the court noted in its order.The court issued notice to LNJP Hospital as well. The director or medical superintendent of LNJP Hospital has to offer an explanation about the state of affairs in the hospital highlighted by the mediaCommenting on the court’s observation on the LNJP health facility, the Delhi government spokesperson said it was the biggest Covid-19 hospital in Delhi and “right now around 2,000 beds are operational there for the coronavirus patients”. “Many critical patients from the central government and the private hospitals in Delhi are being referred to LNJP Hospital for better medication. So far, over 2100 patients from LNJP hospital have successfully recovered from Covid-19 infection and returned to their homes,” the spokesperson said.“National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is an autonomous body and their team visited the LNJP hospital on Thursday. They expressed their satisfaction after scrutinising facilities at the hospital. We will appraise the honourable Supreme Court about this as well,” the spokesperson added.According to the Delhi Corona app, there are 5,814 beds for Covid-19 patients in Delhi’s government hospitals out of which only 2,620 beds are occupied. Despite that, patients suffering from Covid-19 are running around desperately for admission in hospitals.“The large number of beds in government Covid-19 hospitals being vacant in a situation where patients suspected of Covid-19 are running from pillar to post to get admission in any hospital tells about the mismanagement and sorry state of government hospitals in Delhi,” the order said.The court’s order also mentioned “the grim situation in other states also, more particularly, in the states of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Gujarat.” The court also took note of the insensitive manner in which bodies of Covid-19 patients were being handled by hospitals in violation of a directive issued by the central government on March 15.“The patients’ relatives are not even informed for several days about the death of the patient as has been reported in the media. It is also brought to our notice that the details of cremation as to when the dead body will be cremated are not even informed to their close relatives due to which the families of the patients are not even able to see the dead bodies or attend their last funeral rites,” the order said.In a text reply, Bhushan Gagrani, principal secretary and member of Maharashtra’s task force to handle the Covid-19 crisis, who is authorised to speak on behalf of the government, said, “We can comment when the state government examines the order and decides on an appropriate response.” In West Bengal, senior Trinamool Congress leader and minister of state for parliamentary affairs Tapas Roy said, “The Supreme Court did not make any observation on West Bengal. It has served a notice to the state, seeking its reply. The court’s observations were related to Delhi and Tamil Nadu.”The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Bengal was critical. “The Bengal government does not wake up as long it is not pulled up by the judiciary,” said BJP state president Dilip Ghosh. A senior official from the Tamil Nadu directorate of public health, who did not want to be named, said: “We keep on expanding services based on the expected numbers. There is no shortage at any point of time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/treatment-of-the-dead-in-hospitals-deplorable-sc/story-bMA2ciV0KSeHcG6JpugE9H.html
13-06-2020||India||India’s Covid-19 cases hit 300,000 mark||India became only the fourth country in the world -- after the United States, Brazil and Russia -- to report more than 300,000 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Friday, 103 days since the start of the outbreak in the country, with the latest 100,000 cases added in just the last 10 days, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.The country reported 11,172 new cases and 384 new deaths on Friday, taking the total number of cases to 309,324, and deaths to 8,882.More than 57% of all cases in India can be traced to just three states – Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu — a fact that highlights how the spread of the virus in the country has largely been centered in a handful of hot spot regions.While the last 100,000 cases surfaced in only 10 days; the previous 100,000 cases took 15 days; and the first 100,000 cases took 78 days. A little under a quarter of all cases have been reported just in the last week, with the total cases doubling over the last 17 days.An identical trajectory is also seen in the number of fatalities with more than a quarter of deaths coming in just the past week. At an average, 329 deaths have been reported every day in the past week. This number was 238 in the seven days before that. The case fatality rate (CFR) in the country stood at 2.9%, significantly lower than the worldwide figure of 5.6%. As of Friday, 154,150 patients had recovered from Covid-19, which means that nearly half (49.8%) of people who had been infected have since been discharged from hospitals. In fact, just this Tuesday, the number of recovered patients in the country outnumbered the number of active cases for the first time. As of Friday evening, there were 146,292 active cases in India.In terms of the areas in the country that have become the hot spots of the pandemic, we see that Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu – the three worst-hit states – account for more than 58% of all cases. If one includes Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh into the mix, it would account for nearly three out of every four cases in the country.Globally, more than 7.3 million infections of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, and 420,000 deaths has been reported since the virus was first reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-cases-hit-300-000-mark/story-n07v2KBTzwslzt6tZd6A6J.html
13-06-2020||India||Employers, workers can negotiate lockdown wages: Supreme Court||Private establishments, industries and employers are at liberty to negotiate with employees and arrive at a settlement regarding payment of wages for 50 days or any other period during which their establishments were closed due to the lockdown, the Supreme Court held on Friday.Such settlement arrived at by the employers and employees will be valid and can be enforced under law despite the March 29 notification of the ministry of home affairs (MHA) mandating payment of full wages to employees for the period during which the establishment was closed, a three-judge bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan clarified.“Both industry and labourers need each other. No Industry or establishment can survive without employees/ labourers and vice versa. We are thus of the opinion that efforts should be made to sort out the differences and disputes between the workers and the employers regarding payment of wages and if any settlement or negotiation can be entered into between them, it may restore a congenial work atmosphere,” the court said, explaining the rationale behind Friday’s interim order.Various private firms and associations had approached the Supreme Court challenging the March 29 notification by the MHA stating that the obligation to pay employees arises only when work is actually done.“An employer and employee have reciprocal promises whereby the right of an employee to demand salary is reciprocal to performance of work by such employee. The employer has a right to not pay if no work is done,” the plea by the Hand Tool Manufacturers Association, an association of around 52 firms based in Punjab, said.The notification issued by the MHA on March 29 stated that employers must pay wages in full to all their employees even if their establishments are closed due to the lockdown.“All the employers, be it in the industry or in the shops and commercial establishment, shall make payment of wages of their workers, at their work places on due date, without any deduction for the period their establishments are under closure during the lockdown,” clause (iii) of the MHA notification said.The notification was later withdrawn by the Centre on May 18, thus remaining in force for 50 days.The Supreme Court in its order passed on Friday did not decide the validity of the notification itself, instead posting the case for a detailed hearing on that aspect in the last week of July. The central government through its top law officer, attorney general KK Venugopal, defended the notification stating that it was intended to alleviate human suffering and will not come in the way if employers and employees wanted to negotiate payment terms.“Government of India is interested in economy restarting, industries restarting. It is for employers to negotiate with employees as to how much wage could be paid for lockdown period, we will not interfere,” the attorney general told the court during a hearing on June 4.However, various industries, traders and their associations, who are petitioners before the apex court in the case, countered that by arguing the workers will not come to the negotiating table as long as the government notification mandating payment of full wages is in operation.The bench had shared the concerns of employers during the hearing stating that mandating payment of full wages during the lockdown could adversely impact industries. The court on June 4 granted protection to employers from any coercive action for violation of the MHA notification. That protection was extended by the court on Friday.The court said employers, establishments, industries and factories that were working during the lockdown period, though not to their full capacity, could also resort to negotiation with their employees.“Private establishments, industries, factories shall permit the employees to work in their establishment who are willing to work, which may be without prejudice to the rights of the employees regarding unpaid wages of above 50 days,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-wages-can-be-negotiated-sc/story-giEkQiO1aSmleNLUJFmSSJ.html
13-06-2020||India||India, US in war of ideas with China: Ex-US diplomat in chat with Rahul Gandhi||Former top United States (US) diplomat Nicholas Burns on Friday dismissed suggestions China is winning the battle against the coronavirus, saying the country has a “fearful leadership” intent on preserving its power and incapable of accommodating the Chinese people’s desire for freedom. Democracies such as India and the US are waging a “battle of ideas with China” and should work together to “make it observe the rule of law”, he said during a video conversation with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi. The conversation was part of a series between Gandhi and global and Indian thought leaders to discuss the Covid-19 crisis and its consequences. As under secretary of state for political affairs during 2005-08 and the state department’s third-ranking official, Burns led negotiations on the India-US civil nuclear agreement. His remarks come in the backdrop of a weeks-long border stand-off between India and China and intensified rivalry between the US and China. Responding to Gandhi’s question on why there has been almost no global cooperation on the Covid-19 crisis, Burns said: “It is a terrible disappointment to me. I’m sure it is to you…this crisis was made for the G20. It was made for Prime Minister Modi and President Xi Jinping and Donald Trump to be working together, all of our countries, for the common global good.”This hadn’t happened, he said, “because Donald Trump doesn’t really believe in international cooperation. He’s a unilateralist…And Xi Jinping chose to compete with Trump.” He added that the US and China were at the “heart of the problem” and hoped they will better work together more effectively in any future crisis.Burns said: “I think a lot of people right now are saying…China’s winning the battle of the Coronavirus, that it’s gaining hearts and minds. I actually don’t see that.“He added that China certainly had “extraordinary power”, which was ”probably not equal to the US militarily, economically, politically yet”. “But it’s gaining, no question about it. What China lacks is the sophistication and openness of a democratic country like India or the US.”Describing China as an “authoritarian country” without the “self-corrective part” of the national DNA seen in India and the US, Burns said the leadership in Beijing is “fearful”. He added, “Fearful men trying to preserve their own power, increasing the grip that they have on their own citizens. Look at what’s happening in Xinjiang…and in Hong Kong.”He said he worried that the “Chinese system is not going to be flexible enough to accommodate the desires of the Chinese people for human freedom and liberty”.The governments of India and the US should together promote democracy, freedom and rule of law around the world, said Burns, who served in the US government for 27 years. “I think it is a powerful idea that Indians and Americans can bring together to the rest of the world. Again…we are not looking for a conflict with China, but we are waging, in a way, a battle of ideas with China,” he said.Gandhi said the partnership between India and the US worked because both were tolerant nations but that DNA of tolerance has now disappeared. He also said the India-US relationship used to be a partnership but now seems to have become “very transactional and episodic”.“I think why our partnership works is because we are tolerant systems. You mentioned that you are an immigrant nation. We are a very tolerant nation. Our DNA is supposed to be tolerant. We are supposed to accept new ideas,” the Congress leader said while responding to Burns, who insisted India and the US share many traits.“We are supposed to be open but the surprising thing is…that open DNA is sort of disappearing…I say this with sadness that I don’t see that level of tolerance that I used to see. I don’t see it in the Us and I don’t see it in India,” Gandhi said.The discussion also focused on the Black Lives Matter protests in the US triggered by the death of George Floyd, which Burns described as “horrible”. He added, “And millions of Americans are protesting for our rights the way you have in India. And India and the US share many traits as we both have liberated ourselves from the British in different [eras]….The US is in a deep political and existential crisis that has gripped us all.”Gandhi criticised divisions in both countries, saying they weaken nations. “When you divide African Americans, Mexicans and other people in the US, so you divide Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs in India, you’re weakening the structure of the country. But then the same people who weaken the structure of the country say they are the nationalists,” he said.Burns described Indian Americans as the “secret weapon” in the bilateral relationship and said the two sides should keep their doors open to each other and lower restrictions on the movement of people. Barriers should be kept low for schemes such as the H-1B visa programme as India can supply the engineers needed by the US, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-us-in-war-of-ideas-with-china-ex-us-diplomat-in-chat-with-rahul-gandhi/story-GDZ1hUWNxvT3KVdNpyNv5N.html
13-06-2020||India||Gujarat Congress seeks EC action over BJP’s ‘abuse’ of power||The Congress on Friday asked the Election Commission (EC) to take action against “misuse and abuse of official machinery by the ruling party to harass” party legislators in the run-up to the Rajya Sabha polls. In its representation, made by senior Congress leaders Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Shaktisinh Gohil, Rajeev Satav, Ahmed Patel, Amit Chavda and Randeep Singh Surjewala, the party has asked the EC to take note of the FIR filed against its Gujarat MLA Punjabhai Vansh. “This is a blatant use of police machinery,” states the representation, a copy of which has been accessed by Hindustan Times. “We strongly apprehend that anyhow, with illegal aid of the police, the ruling party is likely to prevent the MLAs from reaching the place of voting. It has also come to light that the ruling BJP intends to reopen old cases and lodge false and frivolous cases against INC MLAs with an intent to impede voters’ rights in the elections,” it adds.The party has requested the EC to not allow the state government to file any more cases without its approval. “We also request the EC to intervene and direct that no MLA should be harassed and/or arrested,” said Congress. “The Commission has already appointed a very senior former IAS officer, Raghav Chandra, as observer to ensure free and fair elections in the state,” said an EC official. “EC is determined to conduct free and fair elections but we can’t intervene in this, matters of jurisprudence are a separate thing. But to ensure there are no apprehension we will keep a watch and take adequate action as and when necessary,” the official added.A second official at the Commission said that a report has been sought from the state government and it will be assessed.The two parties have been at loggerheads over 24 Rajya Sabha seats, including the 18 for which elections were initially slated to be held in March but were pushed to June 19 due to the coronavirus crisis. The Congress, earlier this week, alleged that the BJP was trying to poach its legislators in Gujarat and Rajasthan. Subsequently, it moved its MLAs to resorts. “If people wish to leave a sinking ship, should the BJP be blamed for it?” asked BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli. “With regard to the petition, the EC is a constitutional body, it will adjudicate on law and not on the basis of what Congress desires and does not desire.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guj-cong-seeks-ec-action-over-bjp-s-abuse-of-power/story-vszAbqcwW8cPVI2NXh7REI.html
13-06-2020||India||UP refuses to open borders with Delhi for now||Restrictions on travel between Uttar Pradesh and Delhi will continue to remain in place considering the spike in Covid-19 infections in the national capital, the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government told the Supreme Court on Friday.The UP administration said it will allow essential services, medical staff, media personnel and advocates to travel between the two states, and added that it was not in a position to open the borders at Noida and Ghaziabad immediately.“There are only (about) 1,000 Covid cases in Noida and Ghaziabad. In Delhi, the total deaths due to Covid is more than 1,000, while it is just 40 in Noida and Ghaziabad,” advocate Garima Prashad submitted on behalf of UP.Haryana, meanwhile, informed the apex court that it will allow travel without restrictions to and from Delhi.On June 4, the Supreme Court asked Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to set up a uniform system for hassle-free movement within the National Capital Region (NCR), a move aimed at clearing up widespread confusion among thousands of commuters.The court was hearing a petition seeking free movement within NCR, an area that comprises the territory of Delhi and districts in the surrounding states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The cities of Gurugram and Faridabad (Haryana), and Noida and Ghaziabad (UP) fall within the NCR.The petitioner in the case, Rohit Bhalla, a resident of Gurugram, pointed out the troubles commuters were facing at the borders due to state-specific rules. He said measures adopted by states were disproportionately impacting citizens in NCR and violating their fundamental rights, including the right to movement under Article 19(1)(d) and the right to carry on with trade or occupation under Article 19(1)(g).The absence of a common pass system was another aspect which Bhalla pointed out in his petition. A three-judge bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, in its June 4 directive, asked the central government to convene a meeting of officials from Delhi, UP and Haryana and come up with a common portal to facilitate interstate travel such as the one between Delhi and Noida or Delhi and Gurugram.A meeting of officials from the three states was convened on June 9, and Haryana agreed that there will be no restrictions on interstate travel. UP, however, had a different take.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the central government, said on Friday he will file a status report on the meeting of June 9. The top court adjourned the matter for June 17 after recording the UP counsel’s submissions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-refuses-to-open-borders-with-delhi-for-now/story-AUBQ97N8qsaescYQtEVtCM.html
13-06-2020||India||1 Indian dead in Nepal border firing; 3rd incident after India eased lockdown||One Indian national was killed and two others were injured when Nepal’s Armed Police Force (APF), which guards the country’s open border with India, opened fire on a group following an altercation inside its territory near the border in Sitamarhi (Bihar), security and government officials said .The incident does not seem to be linked to the recent friction between India and Nepal over the latter redrawing its map to claim territory that India has always claimed. One official, who asked not to be named, said this is third such incident in the last one month on the border when Nepal’s police force has fired to disperse people, particularly after India started easing its nationwide lockdown – first on May 17 and then completely on June 1. Nepal has announced a lockdown in the border region till June 14. Due to coronavirus disease, the free movement of people between India had Nepal stopped over the past three months with Nepal APF increasing the number of posts to stop Indians from entering its territory. Only those on a list shared by local administrations from both sides were allowed to travel to and fro; cargo movement was also allowed. With India easing its lockdown, the officials explained, Indians in border villages have been trying to go across the border as they used to, and the APF has been intervening to stop them. Without sharing details, the first official added that “on two previous occasions, the Nepal APF fired in the air near the border to prevent people trying to enter its territory.”Another official who asked not to be named said that Vikesh Yadav (22), who was killed in firing on Friday morning near Lalbandi-Janki Nagar border, and the two injured Uday Thakur (24) and Umesh Ram (18) , were not in the list of persons shared by the local administrations. They were accompanied by others from their village and stones were thrown at the APF, the second official added, citing preliminary reports.“Nepal APF has informed us that the villagers tried to snatch weapons from them but there will be an enquiry by them and by us also. As of now, everything is peaceful and locals have been told not to violate the lockdown imposed by Nepal,” said this person.The incident comes at a time when both countries are locked in a diplomatic dispute over territory following a map issued by Nepal that stakes claim over Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura. India’s ministry of external affairs said “such artificial enlargement of territorial claims will not be accepted by India”.India maintains that these were part of Uttarakhand while Kathmandu, in its recent map, had shown them as part of Western Nepal.Kumar Rajesh Chandra , Director General of the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), India’s force on the borderexplained that the local incident took place around 8.40 am in Nepalese territory when members of a family, some of whom reside in Nepal (and some in India) were meeting near the border. “The Nepal APF objected (to them being there) saying there is lockdown in Nepal till June 14 , leading to some avoidable and instant altercation. Nepal APF has said that villagers became aggressive and they had to open 15 rounds of fire. This is being investigated.” Chandra added that situation is now normal and local commanders on both sides are in touch. He said SSB has submitted preliminary findings to the ministry of home affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-indian-dead-in-nepal-border-police-s-firing/story-1ib1ttriLvMMb8xXk5PzoM.html
13-06-2020||India||Covid-19: India-specific clinical score may predict risk||Some members of the national task force on Covid-related matters have proposed an India-specific clinical score to identify people with coronavirus who are at a higher risk of developing severe disease or dying, which will help in picking up warning signs early and saving lives.While doctors have been using their clinical acumen to determine which patient could turn serious, the national guidelines will be standardised, looking at the overall evidence generated from the country.“Some of us have been asking for analysis of India data and surveys to develop our own clinical score. It will require a set protocol that the task force is in the process of forming. However, no final decision has been taken on it yet,” said a member of the task force, who did not wish to be identified.Among the risk factors that have been seen in Covid patients in India that likely led to the disease turning severe is more than one co-morbid condition such as diabetes and hypertension, chronic kidney disease and obesity.“This is what is being usually seen but there could be other conditions that are specific to our patients. Hence, more evidence needs to be looked at comprehensively from hospitals across India to zero in on all those conditions that lead to a higher risk of Covid patients developing serious illnesses and not recovering as well. This will help further improve our case fatality rate,” said another member, requesting anonymity.“CDC has also come out with a list of high-risk conditions among Covid patients, and it makes sense for India also to come up with a list of our own, based on how our patients behave,” the member added.The US CDC (United States Centre for Disease Control) has enlisted 11 conditions that can lead to severe Covid disease.The conditions are asthma, chronic kidney disease with dialysis, chronic lung disease, diabetes, haemoglobin disorders, immunocompromised condition, liver disease, people aged 65 years and older, people in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, serious heart conditions, and severe obesity.A study published in JAMA network last month also endorsed creating a clinical risk score to “help identify patients with Covid-19 who may subsequently develop critical illness.”Experts say it will also help in rationalising resources now that cases are rising in India.“With the number of patients rising, this is also a way of rationalising how to use the medical resources in the best possible way, as people shouldn’t be occupying beds unnecessarily. Those who need it must get it,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.The clinical score, he says, will also help doctors in taking note of patients with non-specific symptoms.“Not everyone is landing with cough, or breathlessness, some are also coming with loss of smell or diarrhoea, so if there is a set list that doctors can refer to then it will improve patient selection at the time of triage, especially in smaller towns or remote areas,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-specific-clinical-score-may-predict-risk/story-AagORl7PtVgMGKgy2NAbcN.html

13-06-2020||India||PM Modi to hold meeting with CMs next week||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to hold a video conference with all chief ministers next week, for consultations about emerging from the lockdown and the increasing number of coronavirus disease cases across the country. The meeting, sixth since the PM announced a national lockdown on March 24 to arrest the spread of the virus, will be held over two days – June 16 and 17 – to cover 21 CMs on day 1 and the remaining on the second day. According to the schedule for the meeting, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh will begin the consultation process on Tuesday afternoon and Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik will be the last to address it on Wednesday evening. HT has reviewed the schedule.“The Prime Minister will listen to us,’’ said a state minister who did not want to be identified, when asked about the agenda of the meeting. The last meeting was held on May 11 ahead of the deadline of the lockdown, and chief ministers had asked for greater autonomy to decide the future course of action to deal with the pandemic. Since then, each state has taken its own decision about restrictions, with the Union ministry of home affairs laying out broader guidelines. For instance, while announcing the `unlockdown’ towards the end of May, the MHA allowed inter-state movement of passengers but left each state to decide whether they wanted to go ahead with it or not. While Delhi allowed it, Haryana was initially hesitant and Uttar Pradesh still restricts movement from Delhi.The meeting comes at a time when the number of infections has been on the rise, especially in metros like Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. “We will know more details tomorrow but we are expecting him to discuss ‘unlocking’,” said an official associated with a Chief Minister’s office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-hold-meeting-with-cms-next-week/story-av8ubNiD97Q8TlDMGRn9jP.html
13-06-2020||India||Rajya Sabha asks MPs to cancel railway tickets in time||A sitting lawmaker of the Rajya Sabha didn’t use 85% of his booked rail tickets in a month -- but the Upper House had to anyway pay the bill because he didn’t bother to cancel.The fact came to light during the Rajya Sabha secretariat’s analysis of train booking by members as part of an effort to curb wasteful expenses. House officials on Wednesday informed Rajya Sabha members that if they don’t cancel their extra tickets, cancellation charges would be recovered from them.Another former MP, the analysis revealed, booked 63 train tickets in just over 23 days but used only 7, wasting about Rs 1.5 lakh of the secretariat.Parliamentarians are entitled to travel at any time in a train in first-class AC or executive class. The member can also be accompanied by one person in air-conditioned two-tier, while travelling by rail, according to the official handbook of MPs.While the number of air tickets for an MP is capped at 34 in a year, there is no such restriction on train tickets. “An MP or his aide might book several tickets on different dates or trains and finally travel as per their convenience,” said an official.Even as the Rajya Sabha secretariat acknowledges the workload of MPs—visiting their constituency, attending social events or parliamentary meetings and other duties as a political leader—they are worried about the wastage of unutilized tickets.“A former Rayja Sabha member made 63 train bookings in just one month but availed only 7. The secretariat had to pay for all 63 bookings even as 87% of the bookings were just wasted,” said an official.Made over 23 days in January last year, these bookings cost a total of Rs. 1.69 lakh. “The fare for his actual travel stood at just Rs 22,085. But the secretariat paid an extra amount of Rs. 1.46 lakhs,” said the analysis.Indian Railways raises its bill every January for all the bookings done throughout the calendar year. For 2019, it submitted a total bill of Rs 7.8 crores to Parliament of India, out of which one-third is to be paid by the Rajya Sabha and the rest by the Lok Sabha Secretariat.Officials fear that out of these tickets billed last year, a large part may have been unutilized, yet not cancelled.To put an end to this practise, Rajya Sabha secretary general Desh Dipak Verma issued a note requesting members to cancel extra tickets in time.“Multiple bookings are being made by some members in various trains departing from same/different stations to different destination stations for the same day. Rajya Sabha Secretariat has to make payments to the Ministry of Railways even for those bookings which are actually not utilized by the members,” Verma wrote.Reminding MPs of unnecessary expenses, especially at a time when Indian Parliament is undertaking drastic measures to cut costs, Verma said, “In case of non-cancellation of bookings which are not actually utilised by the members, the amount of fare of such bookings shall be recovered from the members.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-asks-mps-to-cancel-railway-tickets-in-time/story-Cxb2dHCMMZolKKldly5pTL.html
13-06-2020||India||Four states impose weekend curfews to contain Covid-19||Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Odisha and Uttarakhand will impose strict restrictions on weekends though businesses and other activities will continue to be allowed on weekdays as states look to kick-start the economy and contain the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) at the same time. In these four states, only essential services will be allowed on weekends and people will have to stay indoors — restrictions similar to that during the hard lockdown imposed on March 25, according to government orders. In some cases, the restrictions will be restricted to certain districts or worst-hit areas.“All citizens, except medical staff and essential service providers, will be required to download e-passes from the COVA app (Punjab’s coronavirus alert app),” chief minister Amarinder Singh said at a video conference on Thursday. A day before that, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik decided to impose a weekend curfew in 11 districts, including in the worst-affected Ganjam. Madhya Pradesh health minister Narottam Mishra, too, said a weekend curfew will be imposed in state capital Bhopal.“We cannot close down everything for a long period. It has a very adverse impact on the economy and the livelihood of the people. But we have decided to impose stricter restrictions in Dehradun,” Uttararkhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said on Wednesday.Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa and Kerala’s Pinayari Vijayan did not impose any weekend restriction but appealed to people to stay indoors on Saturday and Sunday.“Travel only if it is necessary. Stay indoors and stay safe,” Yediyurappa said on Friday.Vijayan said curfew-like restrictions will be imposed in the containment zones, which have strict perimeter control and are considered the epicentres of infections.In a related development, Kerala decided on Friday to shut the Guruvayur Sree Krishna temple after a spurt in Covid-19 cases in Thrissur district, where the famous shrine is situated. “Many areas in Thrissur have reported a spike in cases. In the prevailing situation, it is good to avoid crowding. The suggestion came from the temple board and the government approved it immediately,” said state minister Kadakampallly Surendran.Unlike several states, Jharkhand has decided not to open malls, cinema halls, religious places and dine-in restaurants despite a central government order allowing these business and activities from June 8. Also, the Mizoram government decided on Monday to impose a complete lockdown for at least two weeks.“We cannot allow public gathering as a large number of migrant workers from states with high number of Covid cases are returning. We will not open the places of gatherings till cases start coming down,” said a Jharkhand government official who did not want to be named.Several states have decided to begin house-to-house surveillance and testing of every person in containment areas. Also, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan have issued directions aimed at putting strict travel restrictions on interstate borders.Some have not yet allowed free movement on borders even as several states have done away with travel passes. “We are continuing with the pass system for interstate travel as it helps to monitor those coming into the state,” said a Himachal Pradesh government official.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-states-impose-weekend-curfews/story-v9sgUAFq9PxVRTOS79hpxJ.html
13-06-2020||India||Tamil Nadu gets new health secretary as death toll comes under scanner||Tamil Nadu on Friday appointed current revenue administration commissioner J Radhakrishnan as the new health secretary, transferring Dr Beela Rajesh to the commercial taxes and registration department, a day after the state’s data on deaths due to the coronavirus disease came under the scanner. The move also comes at a time when a multi-disciplinary team appointed by the Centre to study the state’s low mortality rate, among other parameters, is expected to submit its report to the Union health ministry. It had visited the seven worst affected districts in the state, including Chennai, earlier this month.Other appointmentsMay 9: Madhya Pradesh Pallavi Jain Govil transferred to general administration department. Replaced by Faiz Ahmad KidwaiMay 12: West Bengal Vivek Kumar transferred to the environment department. Replaced by Narayan Swaroop NigamMay 20: Bihar Sanjay Kumar transferred to the tourism department. Replaced by Uday Singh KumawatMay 29: Nagaland, Principal secretary health Menukhol John transferred to education department. Replaced by Ahola Those.June 12: Tamil Nadu, Dr Beela Rajesh transferred to Commercial taxes and registration department. Replaced by J Radhakrishnan“Our concern is to prevent and contain the disease. If it spreads, we should not lose lives. In that context, Tamil Nadu emerges as the best in the country. This visit will offer us insights which can be emulated in other states,” Rajendra Ratnoo, the nodal officer in the central team coordinating between the Centre and the state, said. The team is also expected to assess gaps in the state’s response to the pandemic, and recommend areas of improvement.Earlier this week, the TN Directorate of Public Health (DPH) and Preventive Medicine found that the death registry maintained by the Greater Chennai Corporation had recorded 236 deaths that were not added to the state’s tally. A nine-member committee has been formed to reconcile Covid-19 related deaths for Chennai.When asked whether a rectification of Covid-19 death numbers would affect the report, Ratnoo said, “We have asked the government to share all the data with us which we will analyse again after it’s updated.”As of June 11, Tamil Nadu (38,716) had the second highest number of cases in the country after Maharashtra (97,648). While Chennai accounted for 70% of the caseload in the state, other affected districts include Chengalpattu, Kacheepuram, Thiruvallur, Ariyalur, Villupuram and Cuddalore.The central team, which included two doctors from Puducherry’s Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, arrived at the capital city on June 4 and travelled to the worst hit districts over three days to study the measures undertaken by the state to tackle the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, including testing levels, containment strategies, quarantine facilities, treatment and clinical management.The team is currently analysing the data and will submit the report soon, Ratnoo said.The Centre has deployed a three-member multi-disciplinary team each in 50 districts of 15 states with a high burden of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for direct monitoring of the situation, and assist in the management of the pandemic.TAMIL NADU’S TESTING LEVELSTamil Nadu also registers the second highest tests per million among the 10 worst affected states in the country. While the national average is 4024 tests per million, Tamil Nadu conducts 8662 tests per million. The only other state that tests more than it is Delhi, which had 34687 cases as of June 11, and a testing average of 13703 per million.According to experts, the state’s public healthcare system that has been in the making for decades is responsible for the robust testing mechanism in place. A turning point was the swine flu outbreak in 2009 when laboratories with RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) facilities were increased across the state. This existing infrastructure resulted in approvals for 77 government and private labs to test Covid-19; one of the highest in the country.“Years of work in strengthening our system is yielding results now,” says Dr K Kolandaswamy, who retired as Director of Public Health on April 30. “Availability of equipment, knowledge of testing, trained manpower helped us to quickly expand efforts during Covid-19.” RT-PCR machines were also mobilised from medical colleges and departments of animal husbandry, agriculture, biotechnology and fisheries.This allowed the state to scale up testing during outbreaks such as when attendees of a religious conference in New Delhi returned to the state in March, or when the Koyambedu wholesale market in Chennai emerged as a hot spot.The state scaled up testing to thousands of samples everyday after it mismanaged one of Asia’s largest wholesale markets in Koyambedu located in the heart of Chennai. From this epicenter the infection spread rapidly across Tamil Nadu and all the way to Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. This compelled extensive contact tracing and testing to contain transmission. More than 3,000 positive cases have been linked to the market and officials say it has been contained. Now, efforts are underway to trace domestic and international travellers using air and rail.“Koyambedu market was our most massive and difficult contact tracing exercise,” said a doctor, who did not wish to be named, at the emergency control room in Chennai from where he oversees contact tracing for the entire state. From mapping international co-passengers to watching wedding videos to track guests, this team coordinates with the state’s health, police and revenue departments, as well as the control rooms in all districts.In one of the earliest cases in March, contact tracing found that a staffperson at Chennai’s Phoenix Marketcity had contracted the virus from a Kerala-based customer who tested positive on landing in Sri Lanka.At a hyperlocal level, contact tracing helped contain transmission at a single street in Chennai in May. A volunteer who distributed food to residents in his neighbourhood was the primary source. A flow chart of the locations he visited and all people with whom he had interacted was prepared. Health workers went door-to-door and police rang up contacts to check for symptoms; 42 cases were reported solely from the street of the volunteer’s residence. A week later it surged to 88 including adjoining lanes. All patients have now recovered. There are 360 containment zones in Chennai currently.“There is an intense street specific approach being taken to root out coronavirus by tracking, tracing, isolating, testing and treating the patients,” J Radhakrishnan had said earlier this week. “The high numbers are an opportunity to bring out positive cases and their contacts so we can limit the spread.”Radhakrishnan, a 1992 batch IAS officer, was appointed as Special Nodal Officer for Greater Chennai Corporation to coordinate coronavirus-related issues with the civic body chief on May 1. “We are looking at team work, interdepartmental coordination and cooperation from the public,”Radhakrishnan said after taking charge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-replaces-its-health-secy-after-death-toll-discrepancy/story-uPFlVCpQroS2tsruwfu7NI.html
13-06-2020||India||Don’t stop people, goods vehicles on national, state highways: MHA||The ministry of home affairs on Friday wrote to states that the 9pm to 5am night curfew announced as part of its Unlock-1 guidelines on May 30 did not apply to passenger transport and movement of goods on national and state highways, officials said.The Centre has objected to states restricting movement of such vehicles on highways during the night curfew. In a communication to all states, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla also said the purpose of restricting movement of individuals during the night was primarily intended at preventing congregation of people and ensuring social distancing, but not hampering supply chains and logistics.“I would like to clarify that the purpose of restricting movement of individuals, except for essential activities, between 9pm and 5am, is primarily intended to prevent congregation of persons and to ensure social distancing,” Bhalla said in his letter.“The restriction does not apply to instances of loading/unloading of goods (as part of supply chains and logistics); buses carrying persons and trucks and goods carriers plying on state and national highways; or persons travelling to their destinations after disembarking from buses, trains and flights,” he added.He advised the states’ governments not to prevent such movement.The current lockdown measures are restricted only to containment zones across the country and will continue till June 30. A large number of social, economic, religious and sports activities have been allowed as part of Unlock-1.Key activities which have opened in the past 12 days include hotels, shopping malls and the dine-in facility in restaurants, which were closed since March 24. However, international flights, Metro rail services, cinema halls, gymnasiums, swimming pools, entertainment parks, theatres, bars and auditoriums and assembly halls are still banned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-stop-people-goods-vehicles-on-national-state-highways-mha/story-SlndF6DfsofBRqaHGHFAUI.html

Temporary school closures to prevent the spread of the disease are currently affecting more than 1 billion students in at least 130 countries.Even when classes restart, some parents may no longer be able to afford to send their children to school. Gender inequalities are likely to grow more acute, with girl children particularly vulnerable to exploitation in agriculture and domestic work.“We need to make sure that children are kept in schools and use proactive approaches to get them back to school, particularly in the aftermath of the lockdown when schools were shut. Social protection and cash transfer programmes for families that have been affected the most is essential to help them provide for the basic needs of their families,” said Soledad Herrero, Unicef’s chief of child protection in India.Around 10.1 million children, 3.9% of India’s 5-14 year-old population of 259.6 million, are employed either as the main worker or as marginal worker, according to the Census of India 2011, which recorded a 2.6 million decrease in child labour since 2001. Rural areas accounted for most of the decline as the number of child workers increased in urban areas, indicating the growing demand for child workers in menial and underpaid jobs in the cities, according to ILO.“Children are the worst impacted in any form of disaster. Covid-19 will be no different. If past trends are to repeat themselves,I believe that millions of children would be forced into child labour across the country. One prevailing perception that will go against children is that children are not being affected by this virus as compared to older people in the family. This will work as a push factor for children to be sent to work, whilst older people will remain at home with the fear of infection,” said Anindit Roy Choudhary, director of programmes and policy impact at the child rights organisation Save the Children (India).Vulnerable population groups – such as those working in the informal economy and migrant workers – have suffered the most from a Covid-19-induced economic downturn, which has increased unemployment, caused a general decline in living standards amid insufficient social protection systems, among other pressures, the report said.Financial distress also increases the risk of child trafficking. “Families, migrant or otherwise, have lost livelihood and economic deprivation has hit families majorly all across. This this will create opportunities for traffickers to recruit children into commercial sexual exploitation, child labour, etc,” said Roy Choudhary.Social protection, easier access to credit, job creation, frequent labour inspections and tighter law enforcement, and measures to get children back into school, including the elimination of school fees, can help mitigate the crises. “We need to work very closely with the family to support the integration of the children in school and some sort of vocational training. Families, communities and businesses have to be on board, including all levels in the private sector, so they feel the pressure to do the right thing, and work with customers to ensure the law is enforced,” said Herrero.“Social protection is vital in times of crisis because it helps those who are most vulnerable. Integrating child labour concerns across broader policies for education, social protection, justice, labour markets, and international human and labour rights makes a critical difference,” ILO director-general Guy Ryder said in a statement. Unicef and ILO are developing a simulation model to look at the impact of Covid-19 on child labour globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/millions-of-children-may-be-pushed-to-work-due-to-covid/story-8m1Z3Tqe9DxfC4Zq2wQDcJ.html
13-06-2020||India||Govt extends deadline for defence equipment||The defence ministry on Friday announced that it had extended the delivery period for all existing capital acquisition contracts with Indian vendors by four months because of supply chain disruptions caused by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). An order passed by ministry’s acquisition wing and approved by defence minister Rajnath Singh notes that “force majeure shall be applicable for a period of four months i.e. 25th March 2020 to 24th July 2020,” said a defence ministry statement. A force majeure refers to unexpected circumstances that prevent someone from fulfilling a contract.The duration of the force majeure will be excluded while calculating the delay in delivery of the contracted equipment/service and imposition of liquidated damages (compensation that may have to be paid for breach of contract), the statement added.“This measure would bring a big relief to the domestic defence industry whose production schedules have been adversely affected by the Covid-19 situation,” a defence ministry spokesperson said.Foreign vendors can directly approach the ministry, which may consider cases on the basis of the situation prevailing in their respective countries, he added.Deliveries that are in the offing include more locally-made artillery guns, light combat aircraft in the more advanced ‘final operational clearance’ configuration and smaller boats.“The extension of the delivery period due to the Covid-19 pandemic is a positive and expected move. The Indian industry had sought some extra time as supply chains have been disrupted,” an HAL official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-extends-deadline-for-defence-equipment/story-wqQCQwQBIk1UxOeiQ4i0NM.html
13-06-2020||India||Supreme Court calls for finding middle path between ecology, development||Saving the environment should not come at the cost of economic development, the Supreme Court said on Friday, adding that a balance should be struck between the two.The observation by the top court came on a plea filed by a lawyer, Abir Phukan, seeking a ban on mining in the Saleki forest reserve, situated close to the Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary in Assam. The area falls in the elephant corridor and in this region, state-owned Coal Indian Limited (CIL) has obtained approval for mining from the standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) in April this year.The Centre, represented by additional solicitor general (ASG) Vikramjeet Banerjee, opposed the plea ,claiming that the environmental impact had already been assessed by the NBWL.Faced with conflicting positions, the bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde and justices AS Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy said, “We are conscious of the fact that our orders in favour of environment affect economic development adversely. There has to be some method by which economic development is not retarded as this has a direct impact on poverty in the country.”In the past, action taken by the court to protect the environment has faced criticism, for instance its decision to ban diesel vehicles to curb air pollution. Walking the tightrope, the bench said that it was aware of the constitutional duty to protect the environment but at the same time, it cannot be oblivious to the economic impact.The court issued notice on the application moved by Phukan and directed ASG Banerjee to come out with a proposal for an alternative site in three weeks. The petitioner was asked to add North Eastern Coalfields,a unit of Coal India, as a party to the case. The standing committee of NBWL gave approval to North Eastern Coalfields on April 7 at a meeting conducted through videoconferencing. The total lease area of 98.59 hectares is situated within a 10-kilometre radius from the boundary of Dehing Patkai Wildlife Sanctuary.The petition pointed out that on August 29, 2019, the standing committee of NBWL had advised a cautious approach, suggesting that the views of wildlife experts be to sought to assess the impact of the proposed mining in the elephant corridor, considering the area’s rich biodiversity. The petitioner claimed: “While several measures would be warranted to create jobs and lift the economy, it is submitted that all such measures should be premised on principles of sustainable development highlighted time and again by this Court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-calls-for-finding-middle-path-between-ecology-development/story-CpHaXzfGDErvxNSmpkoN3K.html
13-06-2020||India||Monsoon arrives, to keep date with Mumbai in 48 hours||Under the influence of a low pressure area which is lying over the Odisha coast, the monsoon has surged and covered the entire Bay of Bengal, northeast India, some parts of Arabian Sea. Goa, and parts of Maharashtra, according to India Meteorological Department.Conditions are favourable for monsoon to advance into many other parts of Maharashtra, including Mumbai, in the next 48 hours. It will also enter West Bengal and Odisha. “The monsoon has strengthened its pace because of the low-pressure system which developed over Bay of Bengal. In fact, by early next week, it will enter Gujarat, covering many parts of central India. This system has helped the monsoon move at its normal pace. It’s too early for us to tell if monsoon will arrive over Delhi on its normal date, June 27,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.Monsoon rains till May 12 are 34% in excess with northwest India recording 42% excess rains, central India recording 95% excess rains, south peninsula 28% excess and northeast India 4% deficient. Due to the low pressure area, scattered heavy to very heavy with extremely heavy rainfall in some areas is likely over coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam, Telangana, Coastal Karnataka, Vidarbha and Konkan and Goa in the next couple of days and some heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely over interior Karnataka, interior Maharashtra and Odisha on Saturday.Parts of northwest India will also get thunderstorms over the weekend. “This is because moisture laden easterly winds are blowing over northwest India and a western disturbance is also impacting the region. So intermittent thundershowers can be expected for the next 2 to 3 days,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-arrives-to-keep-date-with-mumbai-in-48-hrs/story-lHNrGsUlGxDx4PtnMpT4dJ.html
13-06-2020||India||PM Modi to meet chief ministers on June 16, 17 amid spike in Covid-19 cases||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be meeting chief ministers over two days next week- June 16 and 17- amid concerns regarding a spike in coronavirus cases across the country. As the fourth phase of lockdown was drawing to a close, it was home minister Amit Shah who held a meeting with chief ministers to deliberate a way out and seek their views. On all earlier occasions, the PM had fronted the talks. Once again, Modi will be meeting the chief ministers as the coronavirus crisis get grimmer.Addressing the Indian Chamber of Commerce on Thursday, PM Modi stressed that the Covid-19 crisis has to be turned into an opportunity and push India towards a self-reliant path. “Every citizen of this country has resolved to turn this crisis into an opportunity. We have to make this a major turning point for this nation. What is that turning point? A self-reliant India,” said the PM.  Coronavirus cases in the country crossed the grim milestone of three lakh cases, barely two weeks after the Centre announced lifting of the nationwide lockdown in phases and dubbed it Unlock 1, on Friday evening. With an “economic focus”, the ministry of home affairs, just before the close of lockdown 4.0, announced that all activities will be opened up in areas outside the containment zone and presented a three-phase plan. A lockdown will, however, remain in place in containment zones till June 30.Maharashtra has the highest Covid-19 positive cases in India with 1,01,141 patients, followed by Tamil Nadu with 40,698 and national capital Delhi with 34,687. India now ranks the fourth-highest in the list of nations hit hard by the highly infectious disease.Some commentators say that India went into lockdown early. Other countries, they say, lifted their lockdown when their disease curve had started to deflate, but here the restrictions are being eased as the curve is going up exponentially.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-meet-chief-ministers-on-june-16-17-amid-spike-in-covid-19-cases/story-NfrdSrgsLdDovYdH860teJ.html
13-06-2020||India||Imran Khan tweets a swipe at India, hits mute on Pak economy. Here is why||Just a little over two hours after Prime Minister Imran Khan tweeted an acerbic offer to India, his government put out a status check of Pakistan’s economy. PM Khan’s adviser on finance and revenue Dr Abdul Hafeez Shaikh released the economic survey that estimates Pakistan’s debt will rise to 88% of the GDP and the economy will shrink for the first time in 68 years by 0.4%. And that is an optimistic picture. The IMF and World Bank have projected that Pakistan, which closes its financial year this month-end, will contract by up to 2.6%Dr Shaikh apportioned much of the blame for the state of the economy between Nawaz Sharif’s Pakistani Muslim League-N governments that had been in power from 2013 to 2018 before Imran Khan came to power with his promise of a ‘Naya Pakistan’, and the coronavirus pandemic.Imran Khan, who has been active on social media hurling barbs at India, hasn’t tweeted on his government’s report card on the economy.“PM Imran Khan is finding himself boxed in… by his political detractors, the army that is closing in, the economy and the Kashmir agenda,” a Pakistan watcher in New Delhi said.Also Watch | ‘India’s package as big as Pak GDP’: Modi govt counters Imran Khan’s ‘offer’ In just two years, PM Khan’s influence within and without the government has dropped sharply. That includes the army too, Pakistan’s most powerful institution whose backing was credited to have helped PM Khan mobilise support from smaller coalition partners.A Bloomberg report published this week underscored that the army has tightened its grip on PM Khan’s government, placing more than a dozen former and serving military officials in prominent roles.Also Read: Army tightens grip on Pakistan as Imran Khan’s popularity wanesLike former retired Lt General Asim Saleem Bajwa, who was already chairman of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority, was given a second job. From April this year, Lt Gen Bajwa who headed ISPR - the military’s propaganda department between 2012 and 2016 - was appointed PM Khan’s communication adviser.There have been indications that the Pakistan army, which had embedded itself in the civilian structure, hasn’t been on the same page as PM Khan.That Imran Khan had been sidelined was clearly visible in March when the army declared that the army would oversee a shutdown to halt the spread of infection, less than 24 hours after Prime Minister Khan told the country in a televised address that he didn’t support a lockdown since it would put millions out of work and hurt the poor. The army went ahead to deploy troops and enforce the lockdown.Also Read: Pak’s troubled economy is hurting more than Imran Khan wants to believe | OpinionIndian intelligence agencies believe that the army is increasingly looking at foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi for a bigger role in the government.There is some disappointment over Imran Khan’s not-so-successful attempts to put the focus on Kashmir, in Pakistan and globally, one Indian official said. “Kashmir has long been used by Pakistan to distract people from the domestic upheavals, political, economic or otherwise. But this hasn’t happened over the last year or so despite several attempts,” the official said.Because of pressure from multilateral bodies such as the terror funding watchdog FATF where it faces the risk of being placed in the blacklist, the Imran Khan government has been unable to go all out to openly support Kashmir.Besides, the 2016 Uri surgical strike and the 2019 Balakote air strikes have sent a message that New Delhi’s response to a terror strike would be unpredictable and could lead to a counter strike.The bleak outlook for the economy makes PM Khan’s troubles so much bigger. Thursday’s economic survey, news agency Reuters reported, reveals that PM Khan’s government had missed almost all economic targets by a wide margin even before the global new coronavirus pandemic.At least 10 million people are expected to slip below the poverty line due to the coronavirus pandemic, pushing the total number of people struggling to survive to 60 million.Apart from the human cost, the troubled economy could seal any chances of the army getting a substantive hike to give soldiers and officers a 20 percent raise that they had asked for. For now, Dr Shaikh, according to Pakistan newspaper Dawn, said there would be a free on current expenditure and the defence budget. He credited PM Khan as well as Army Chief Gen Qamar Bajwa for this decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imran-khan-tweets-a-swipe-at-india-hits-mute-on-pak-economy-here-is-why/story-3H1Ts0tLLkYQ4wGm0xEHHP.html
