At the centre of the controversy is United States (US) President Donald Trump, who suggested on Twitter that implementing mail-in ballot voting for the presidential election would rig the US elections this November. The underlying tensions he is facing are clear — many people who would likely use mail-in ballots to vote in the presidential election would likely favour Democrats. So he claimed, rather falsely, that mail-ins are “substantially fraudulent”.Twitter’s response was forceful. The offence was clear: Trump’s tweet constituted harmful and politically-charged misinformation about voting, which is the most sanctified process in any democracy. For the first time, Twitter flagged a Trump tweet as potentially misleading — a bold act against a sitting president.Trump hit back at the company. Within days, he issued an executive order that attempts to wrangle content moderation authority away from the industry and into the hands of the government. The presidential order is, according to most legal scholars, lazy and desperate. But it is perhaps one of the most legally challengeable policies in that it attempts to enforce overstepping the longstanding Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which grants immunity to Internet firms, including social media networks, over user-generated content that appears on the platform.Refreshingly, Twitter did not back down. The next day, the company flagged yet another one of Trump’s tweets for inciting violence, this time on the George Floyd protests. Since then, Trump has raised the stakes, lashing out at Antifa (the anti-fascist movement who he blames for the protests) and describing the protesters as anarchists. This is significant as the company has essentially now asserted that he has both disseminated disinformation and incited violence.If we were to judge Twitter’s actions, we have to say that the company has chosen to favour democratic interest over all else. Juxtapose Twitter’s response with the approach Facebook has taken — with chief executive Mark Zuckerberg suggesting that he does not wish to be the arbiter of truth. It now emerges that these two companies represent diametrically opposite forces. The employee walkouts and viral resignations in protest of Facebook’s shoulder-shrugging at Trump’s tweets are illustrative.As many have argued, Facebook’s notion of protecting free speech is not protective at all. In fact, the policies espoused by Zuckerberg in Georgetown late last year are entirely in his firm’s commercial interest. It is quite possible that they have nothing to do with protecting users’ freedom of speech. In deciding not to flag or take down offensive content, Facebook protects its business. The company can leave offensive material, which is often among the most engaging content. This makes sure that it does not avoid alienating large constituencies that might see the president’s tweets favourably; and doesn’t voluntarily trigger the slippery slope of content regulation by setting policy boundaries itself.At the heart of these issues is a fundamental tension: What does democracy mean when practised over digital platforms? Both Indian and western democratic systems have always had two fundamentally opposed ideals in institutionalism versus free speech. On the one hand, we have created institutional structures such as the government, the political system, and the radically capitalistic economic regime to build an intellectually free and open society. Over time, though, institutions may grow to enjoy excess power and germinate overbearing economic and social exploitation; we require individual intellectual independence — through freedom of expression — to push back on the undue concentration of power.Indeed, free speech has always been applied to challenge governments and industries. But the commercial regime underlying the likes of Facebook, YouTube and Twitter has turned this checks-and-balance system internalised within functioning democracies upside down. Before the modern media age, citizens were naturally forced to be accountable for their speech — whether in print media, television, or public protest formats. Without the courage to publicly back your words, you couldn’t say them. Now, though, a new kind of economic logic has emerged that favours the algorithmic maximisation of consumer-media engagement at the expense of everything else. Such effects often favour the virality of extreme content because of its propensity to engage the mind. Thus, while Zuckerberg and his company hold to an even-harder free speech line, we must acknowledge that the norms of free speech themselves have been revolutionised by Facebook itself.Inevitably, Trump’s clash with Twitter will place more pressure on policymakers, particularly members of Congress, to change the way content regulation works. Trump’s actions clarify that we need to set standards on speech issues so that our democratic norms do not topple. The light at the end of the tunnel is emerging in the effort to reconstruct Section 230. This is a growing sentiment, including with both the President and his Democratic opponent Joe Biden. As this discussion progresses, Facebook will increasingly be seen as a media entity as opposed to agnostic global platforms — just fruits, perhaps, for a company that ranks and orders users’ online news and social feeds to determine what they see.When seen in this light, Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey and his company, who have been far more proactive and progressive than Zuckerberg and Facebook, should receive high praise. Dorsey is telegraphing the actions of policymakers, projecting that there are elements of the democratic process that we should do our best to protect. This explains several of his and Twitter’s recent actions — the ban on political advertising, the statements against the marketised micro-targeting of communities with political communications, and this bevy of battles with President Trump included.We can only hope, in our desire to preserve the structure of democracy as best as possible, that the other dominant digital platforms will follow suit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/facebook-is-weakening-democracy/story-8558QbG80JT10QP2VXkbqK.html
12-06-2020||Chandigarh||‘Lockdown on weekends, public holidays’ evokes mixed response among traders in Ludhiana||The state government’s order on stricter lockdown in the state on weekends and public holidays has evoked a mixed reaction among market associations here.While a few market associations have raised a hue and cry over the order and warned the authorities of an agitation if the decision is not reviewed, others have sought an extension in working hours during other weekdays.Traders rued that the business was slowly coming back on track after two month-long lockdown, but this announcement has again added to the woes of the traders, who are already reeling under losses. Traders in Chaura Bazar said this would add to the fear in the minds of residents and this is not in the interest of business. President of the Chaura Bazar Shopkeepers Association Parampal Singh Witty said, “Traders are reeling under losses and, at a time, when the business was gaining momentum, the state government has announced anther lockdown, that too on weekends, when residents move out to shop. The decision is not in favour of shopkeepers and the government should review it.”Shopkeepers of the Akalgarh market and those situated near Clock Tower have threatened to launch an agitation if the government did not roll back the order.President of the Akalgarh Market Garment Association Manpreet Singh Bunty said, “Rather than announcing lockdown on weekends, the government can announce the same for Mondays and Tuesdays. On weekends, customers from other districts also visit the city and, if the markets remained closed, how will traders be able to earn a livelihood. Their business would collapse.”He also threatened an agitation if the decision was not withdrawn.Many other trader associations have demanded that shops should be allowed to open till 9 pm on other days.President of the Model Town Market Association Amarjit Singh and president of the Ghumar Mandi Shopkeepers Association Pawan Batra said, “With the rising number of Covid-19 positive patients, it is understandable that government has to take some strict steps. But, some relief should be provided to the traders also by extending the working hours. The customers do not move out in the scorching heat and the shops are closed at 7pm, leaving a limited time for the customers to visit markets. The shops should be allowed to open at least till 9pm so that traders could cover up their losses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lockdown-on-weekends-public-holidays-evokes-mixed-response-among-traders-in-ludhiana/story-3gDiagawsQeEzpY5VoC5mN.html
12-06-2020||Chandigarh||2-day symposium on Covid-19’s social perspective concludes at Ludhiana college||A two-day online international symposium on “Covid-19: Social Perspective” organised by the Gujranwala Guru Nanak Institute of Management and Technology (GGNIMT), Ghumar Mandi, concluded on Friday.At least, 2,500 people, including teachers, doctors, economists, businessmen and eminent people, from the world of education from all across the country and abroad participated in the conference.Noted economist Sucha Singh Gill, CRRID (labour and unemployment), Chandigarh, inaugurating the symposium, said, “The Covid-19 pandemic has devastated lives and livelihoods. It has triggered an economic crisis with far reaching implications. The disruption has changed patterned social practices and social order, along with the culturally embedded assumptions, including the way of life.”Ramesh Vinayak, executive editor, The Hindustan Times, in his presidential remarks, shared his concern over the financial implications affecting the social life. The kind of life at the workplace and a system of work from home was never heard of before, he said emphasising the changes in social life.Dilshad Dhaliwal, fellow of the Tata Research Institute, Toronto, was the expert for the day. While deliberating on health and hygiene, she gave detailed information about Covid-19 and associated superstition and facts.She said following general healthy living advice such as eating a balanced diet, staying hydrated, being physically active, getting enough sleep, and managing stress are the best recommendations for staying healthy during these difficult times.Resource person Mandeep Kochhar, vice-principal, Bombay Teacher Training College, said, “This severe disruption has shaken the education system. The online teaching has turned up as a massive shock for both teachers’ productivity and also students’ social life and learning. Teachers need socio-emotional support to face the pressure being put to deliver learning at the time of crisis as well as support their students’ emotional needs.”Dr Macario Gayeta from Philippines opined that the transition from physical classrooms to the digital learning has led to a significant impact in the behaviour of students and teachers. He mentioned that online education is not merely speaking in a microphone at one end and listening at the other.Jaswinder Singh Brar, professor of economics from Punjabi University, Patiala, discussing the socio-economic impact of Covid-19, said that life would not be the same now and changes in income levels will change social security and social lifestyles altogether. He talked in length about the internal governance of the country and state public health systems.SP Singh, president, GKEC, proposed the vote of thanks. He appreciated the resource persons for shedding light on a very valuable topic. He also acknowledged the efforts of GGNIMT in keeping the people constructively engaged during this difficult time.Prof. Manjit Singh Chhabra , director, GGNIMT, emphasised on adopting online teaching methodology ,social distancing and work from home options to fight against this pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/two-day-symposium-on-covid-19-s-social-perspective-ends-in-ludhiana-s-ggnimt/story-9JSKv8NKwfk9Uvjs4aIa1H.html

Due to this, the meeting was conducted with officials of both the organisations to discuss the conditions on the establishment of vending zones. MC secretary Neeraj Jain said, “No final decision could be taken in the meeting as officials of LIT and GLADA said that they needed some time to study the project. The MC commissioner has scheduled a meeting next week for taking a final decision on the same. The MC is also working to establish permanent vending zones in the city and the file regarding the same has been sent to the local bodies department for approval.”An official, requesting anonymity, said LIT and GLADA officials are showing reluctance in providing their land for setting up vending zones.Earlier, in the last week of February, the police had announced the third phase of the anti-encroachment drive under which 60 roads of the city had to be covered and made free of encroachments. The authorities had covered 40 roads in the initial two phases and lodged FIRs against around 100 shopkeepers and vendors.The drive was also opposed by different vendor associations stating that the MC has failed to establish vending zones in the city and, before removing the vendors from roads, the MC should set up vending zones where vendors could earn their livelihood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-chief-holds-meeting-with-lit-glada-officials-on-setting-up-of-vending-zones/story-59n3tZy4C6lKSFjVzWTJXL.html

The Gateway Tower high-rise was sealed on June 3 after a resident was tested positive for Covid-19 on May 29. The high-rise was de-sealed on the night of June 11, a day before the petition was slotted for hearing in the Supreme Court.“It was our contention that only one tower had to be sealed but the authorities sealed the entire high-rise complex. This was against the May 31 directions issued by Uttar Pradesh chief secretary that only one tower is to be sealed if only one positive case is found in a high-rise. After the high-rise was de-sealed on June 11, one of my prayers in petition was withdrawn,” Mohammad Fuzail Khan, the lawyer appeared for the petitioner, said.The petition also mentioned a recent case of Jaipuria Sunrise Greens in Indirapuram where the entire high-rise was sealed but later the sealing was relaxed and directions were issued by the chief medical officer to seal only the tower where a 35-year-old resident had tested positive for Covid-19.“The second contention in the petition was against the sector scheme or containment zone plans. This was imposed in Vaishali on May 31 and implemented from June 1. This concept finds no mention in Centre’s notification issued under Unlock 1 plan. So, It was our contention that the sector scheme should be scrapped,” he said.During the hearing on Friday, the apex court disposed of the petition and directed, “We have no doubt that the district magistrate of Ghaziabad shall ensure that the national guidelines are followed.”The sector scheme has also been imposed in Khoda since May 10 and in Loni since May 27 in the wake of rising number of cases from these places.“The court’s direction means that the authorities will now have to restrict themselves to containment zones rather than putting entire localities under the sector scheme. The areas of Khoda, Loni and Vaishali have huge population and putting all residents under a strict lockdown proved troublesome. The court directions will also apply to Khoda and Loni localities,” Khan added.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said he is yet to receive a copy of the order.“The Gateway Tower was de-sealed after 14 days under sealing. In connection with the petition, we will take up appropriate steps as directed by the court. We are awaiting the court order,” he said.In Khoda and Vaishali, the district officials provided some relief to residents by allowing markets to open on an experimental basis on Thursday. Since the sector scheme was implemented, the markets were shut and movement of residents restricted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ensure-govt-guidelines-are-followed-sc-tells-ghaziabad-dm-on-plea-over-high-rise-de-sealing/story-hjqOsS1lmOz5lgYGp3Pf8L.html

Now, it would be an open drain, which would discharge the rainwater into the Buddha Nullah.Area councillor Dr Jai Prakash said, “It used to be an open drain, but former MLA Harish Bedi got the pipes installed. Those pipes used to choke frequently and the rainwater would accumulate in the areas, including New Kundanpuri, Upkar Nagar, Guru Nanak Pura, near the Domoria Bridge and surrounding areas. But, the pipes have already been removed and we are now working to clean the nullah. The rainwater, which earlier used to accumulate in the nearby areas, would now be discharged into the Buddha Nullah through this 14-ft wide open drain.”The Talab Bazar drain, moving through the bridge, has been choked for years and the residents had to bear the brunt for the same every year during monsoon. Accumulated rainwater enters houses of residents in Guru Nanak Pura and New Kundanpuri area leaving the residents as a harried lot. The residents had been raising a hue and cry over the choked drain lines for years, following which the MC decided to remove pipes from the drain last year. MC commissioner Kanwalpreet Kaur Brar also conducted a meeting with officials of the health branch on Friday and directed the staff to make arrangements for dealing with dengue and chikungunya ahead of the monsoon season.

The highest spike till now was 82 cases in a day. The total positive cases in KDMC is now 1,911, the civic body has recorded total 55 deaths till date.Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer of KDMC, said, “The civic body recorded its highest number of cases on Friday as it comprises of three days of pending reports. Several reports were awaited after testing which we got on Friday.”After Thane, a private lab in Kalyan was served a notice by KDMC for giving false positive reports on Covid-19 test. Earlier in May, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) had asked a private lab to stop testing after irregularities were reported.The notice was served to a private lab in Kalyan after a person from Shahad complained to the civic body about contradicting test reports.A KDMC official said, “The complainant had a fracture last month due to an accident at his residence. His swab was collected by the lab when he was undergoing treatment for the fracture. The lab reported him to be positive. However, the man claimed that he did not move out of his house during lockdown.”In order to cross check the reports, the complainant immediately got another test done which came negative. Following this he informed the civic body about the same.“Based on a complaint we have served a notice to the lab early this month and asked them to explain the reason for false positive in this case,” said Patil. Meanwhile, TMC recorded 174 positive cases and three deaths on Friday, taking total number of cases to 4,829 and death toll to 148. “Among the three deaths reported on Friday was a 45-year-old resident of Gandhi Nagar, who was admitted at Kalwa Hospital on June 7 and died on the same day. His Covid test reports came later stating that he was positive. The case is similar with the 43-year-old resident of Wagle Estate, who died a day after being admitted to Kalwa hospital. The third death was an 84-year-old woman from Kolshet,” said Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner. On Friday, 91 patients have recovered and were discharged in Thane city.

12-06-2020||Delhi||HC dismisses plea challenging lifting of lockdown restrictions||The Delhi High Court on Friday dismissed a plea challenging the May 30 order of the Centre to unlock the country in a phased manner, while stating that the decision of lifting the lockdown had not been taken in haste and would ensure a proper balance between containing the spread of Covid-19 pandemic and making certain that people are not forced to starve. A bench of justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad also imposed a fine of ₹20,000 on a fifth-year law student Arjun Aggarwal, who filed the plea, and said that it was “completely misconceived” and filed only to “gain publicity”. The bench, however, said that the government is expected to remain cognizant of the situation and evaluate it closely.“If it is found that the rate of infection is going up, they can always review their decision and impose curbs, depending upon the situation,” the bench said in a 23-page judgment. The court said that a series of orders have been passed, starting from March 2020, to tackle the situation and decisions have been taken by the government to ensure minimum hardship to the people. Several economic packages have been announced to regenerate the economy.“This court can also take judicial notice of the fact that the world over, the trend is now to reduce restrictions imposed due to lockdown, and to return to normal life. In order to ensure a proper balance between containing the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic and making certain that people are not forced to starve, the government has issued the impugned order. The reopening has been directed in a phased manner and is not a decision that appears to have been taken in haste,” the court said.The petitioner, through his counsel, had contended that lifting the lockdown would deprive the citizens of their basic fundamental rights such as life, and ignore the health of its citizens by exposing them to the threat of Covid-19. The plea also stated that lockdown restrictions have been lifted only considering the economic situation while endangering its citizens to the extent of succumbing to a contagious disease in the absence of any proven medical cure.The court, while dismissing the plea, also said that the lockdown has resulted in the loss of jobs for several lakhs of people, and scores of people were forced to walk considerable distance and stand in long queues at food distribution centres just to have two meals a day. It also said that production had come to a “grinding halt” and people had become unemployed.“The economic situation of the country has taken a terrible hit due to the lockdown. In fact, many analysts have opined that the lockdown has caused more human suffering than Covid-19 itself. Economists have forecast that the Indian economy will shrink as a result of the steps taken to contain the coronavirus disease pandemic. Indian economy virtually came to a standstill during the nationwide lockdown,” the court said.Meanwhile, a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan refused to entertain two pleas which had sought strict imposition of lockdown in the national capital. The court said that said it was not going to issue any notice following which the petitioners withdrew their pleas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-dismisses-plea-challenging-lifting-of-lockdown-restrictions/story-3EL94lN3UYujoByyeAi5sN.html

The courts have also been asked to provide details of such applications filed and heard by them till Monday.The HC also directed the state prisons department to respond on whether the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for testing asymptomatic and high-risk contacts of Covid positive patients were implemented in prisons across Maharashtra and directed it to provide details of standard operating procedure (SOP) followed for testing in prisons. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice SS Shinde, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) through video conferencing, was informed by senior counsel Mihir Desai that there was a genuine concern for the well-being of inmates after several inmates and jail staffers tested positive for Covid-19. The PIL, along with another filed by Archana Rupwate, sought various reliefs for prisoners.On Friday, Desai submitted that though the SC and HPC had issued guidelines to decongest jails, trial courts were not deciding bail applications in a speedy manner and proper video calling facilities were not provided to inmates.The state, however, submitted that facilities were being made available for inmates to communicate with their family members and lawyers with coin boxes and smart phones being made available at correctional homes across the state. The state also submitted that all correctional homes had made necessary arrangements to receive money orders or electronic transfer of money in the name of the inmate and such details were being displayed on the prison department’s website.After hearing the submissions, the bench directed trial courts in the state to give details pertaining to total applications received by them for bail and parole and how many of them have been decided. Along with details of procedure followed for testing inmates, prison authorities are also expected to submit details of phone calling facilities provided to inmates to communicate with their relatives and lawyers.

Mehta was in Thane to take a stock of the situation in view of increasing Covid-19 cases in the city. He also asked to increase the area of the containment zone and ensure that restrictions are strictly implemented in these zones.Mehta visited various parts of the district to check the preparedness of the local bodies to handle increasing Covid cases.A civic official said, “He expressed that increase in quarantine will help flatten the curve. If one positive case is found, at least 20 close contacts of the person should be quarantined. We will have to increase the number of quarantine and isolation centres. If more people are quarantined, the load on hospitals will also ease and only critical patients can be sent to hospitals.”Mehta also insisted on extensive screening of slum-dwellers. “He said no one from the slums should be home-quarantined and that they should be taken to quarantine centres. The area of containment zones will also be increased and lockdown restrictions will be strictly implemented in these zones.”Mehta also asked the corporation to have adequate stock of essential medicines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/quarantine-more-close-contacts-mehta-to-tmc/story-6XoGfPZjgh9R9dqqPF09yM.html
12-06-2020||Delhi||Treat plea challenging order on reserving part of hospitals for Covid care as representation: HC to govt||The Delhi High Court on Friday directed the government to treat a plea challenging its order that all private hospitals/nursing homes in the city with a bed capacity of 50 or more should reserve 20% capacity for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, as a representation contending that hospitals would further spread infection due to the difficulty of segregating patients.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan asked the petitioner Kaushal Kant Mishra, an orthopaedic surgeon, to give a representation to the government, which would be dealt with in accordance with the law and guidelines. The court disposed of the plea that contended that the said order of the government was “arbitrary” and in violation of the Indian Constitution as it would lead to the hospitals becoming further spreaders of infection.The plea, filed through advocate Pooja Dhar, stated that most of the 117 hospitals or nursing homes covered in this order are designed as single buildings, and not separate blocks, where Covid-19 patients cannot be effectively segregated from other patients.“Challenges start from common entry and exit point, common lobby, common lifts, common washrooms, etc, which are used by all patients whether Covid-19 or not. This definitely increases the risks of infection, despite the facility taking all possible care of reducing intermingling [sic],” the plea said.The petitioner suggested that it would be better to take over a complete hospital rather than reserving only 20% beds as stated by the government in its order. The plea also said that each hospital can also dedicate one ambulance with emergency care in case any Covid-19 patient needing hospitalisation arrives.“A more effective solution would be to create new centres dedicated to the treatment of Covid-19 patients, such as hotels, banquet halls, stadiums, etc., which will result in the treatment of Covid-19 patients in a segregated environment and avoid the risk of infection to non-Covid-19 patients,” the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/treat-plea-challenging-order-on-reserving-part-of-hospitals-for-covid-care-as-representation-hc-to-govt/story-Tw0IxE9kusnQXZ6eMh4vEL.html

It issued a notice to the Centre, Delhi government, North DMC and various doctors’ associations, seeking their stand on the Public Interest Litigation (PIL).A detailed order is awaited in the matter which is listed for further hearing on July 8.Appearing for the Delhi government, additional solicitor general (ASG) Sanjay Jain and additional standing counsel Satyakam told the court that they have disbursed money to the civic body for various accounts, including stamp collection.Advocate Akhil Mittal, the standing counsel of the North DMC, told the court that they are ready to pay the salaries of the resident doctors of not just Hindu Rao and Kasturba Gandhi hospitals, but all the six hospitals run by them. He said that there are a total of 370 resident doctors in both the above-mentioned hospitals and their salaries would amount to ₹4 crore. The total amount to be disbursed by both the government and the North body for all six hospitals is ₹8 crore.Standing committee chairperson, North corporation, Jai Prakash said, “We have had a chat with the doctors on the matter. We are making efforts to release their salaries at the earliest.

12-06-2020||City||Delhi University demand Covid care centre in varsity||New Delhi: In light of the rise in coronavirus (Covid-19) disease cases in the Capital as well as the scarcity of hospital beds, teachers of the Delhi University (DU) have demanded that the varsity’s health centre be equipped with basic facilities to fight the pandemic. The demand comes closely on the heels of nine foreign students residing in a DU hostel testing positive for the coronavirus this week and the death of a senior professor of the varsity from the disease.Wali Akhtar, the former head of DU’s Arabic department died Tuesday. According to his colleagues, Akhtar was not able to avail healthcare facilities due to shortage of beds even though he had fever and a lung infection.“At least seven hospitals denied him treatment when his family approached them, despite him exhibiting symptoms. After Al Shifa admitted him, we tried contacting various labs for testing but it took no less than two days. He died nearly two hours after his sample was taken,” said his colleague Zafeeruddin, who teaches at the department. “The university should upgrade its healthcare centre to help faculty. Members of the teachers’ association have assured that they will look into this,” he said. His test reports came back Friday which showed he had Covid-19, the Al Shifa hospital confirmed.Former academic council member Pankaj Garg, the convener of the teachers’ group Indian National Teachers Congress (INTEC), said he has written to DU vice chancellor Yogesh Tyagi on Friday asking him to take steps to help the DU community. “The university must create a 24-hour help centre at WUS Health Centre at the North Campus, along with a testing facility. We have also requested the VC to convert two guest houses at the North Campus to care centres for treatment of Covid-19 patients. Doctors and nurses employed at health centres can treat Covid-19 patients under the supervision of the Chief Medical Officer of the centre.”Executive Council member Rajesh Jha had earlier this week expressed his concern over the same issue. In another letter to the vice chancellor, he asked the varsity to upgrade the healthcare facilities to meet the challenges of current times.“We also requested the VC that some vacant staff quarters could be developed as quarantine centres for our employees as the sizes of many staff quarters make home quarantine only notional,” he said.Despite repeated calls and messages, VC Tyagi did not comment on the matter.“There are no sanitisation drives being carried out by the university in residential quarters and we have asked the varsity to take some steps to follow the standard operating procedures laid down by the health ministry in the matter,” Jha said, adding that four people from the exam branch building had also tested positive. A senior official from the examination branch, however, refuted the claim.Currently, if any person with symptoms of coronavirus approaches the health centre, they are referred to other hospitals. A senior official at the health centre, requesting anonymity, said: “Our role is to provide primary healthcare and the health centre has been functional throughout. Comprehensive healthcare services are provided here and this is not a hospital. We apply our medical knowledge to the best of our efforts and if indicated, we refer people with symptoms to hospitals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-university-demand-covid-care-centre-in-varsity/story-pZHoyJyB6ON60hL72m1MgL.html
12-06-2020||Mumbai||HC reserves order on Arnab Goswami’s plea to quash FIRs||The Bombay High Court continued its protection from arrest to Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and reserved its order in a criminal writ plea filed by Goswami seeking various reliefs, including quashing of two FIRs filed against him. The court directed Goswami and the state government to submit written notes at the earliest.A division bench of justice Ujjal Bhuyan and justice Riyaz Chagla while hearing the petition by Goswami was informed by senior counsel Harish Salve through video conferencing on Friday that the allegations against the journalist were unfounded. Goswami has been booked under section 153, 153 A, 153 B, 295 A, 298, 500, 504, 505 (2), 506, 120 B and 117 of the Indian Penal Code for intent to provocation of riot, promoting disharmony between groups based on religion, defilement of place of worship among others. The charges were based on two FIRs filed against him at NM Joshi Marg police station and Pydhonie police station on April 22 and May 2 for giving communal colour to the mob lynching incident at Palghar and the protest of the migrant’s outside Bandra station.Salve read out each section under which Goswami was booked and denied the allegation that his comments on the Palghar and Bandra station incident in his TV programme were politically motivated. Salve said that Goswami’s remarks on the programme did not have any malafide but could be attributed to journalistic enthusiasm.Salve also asked the court as to who would be responsible if Goswami contracted Covid-19 while attending various police stations across the country where FIRs have been registered against him, for the same incident.On its part state, counsel Kapil Sibal refuted the claims of Salve and said that the statements on the programme had hurt the sentiments of the people.After both sides concluded their arguments, they sought permission from the court to submit written notes of the same. The court has now reserved the matter for orders. The court also extended the interim protection from any coercive action granted to Goswami in the previous hearing on June 9, till the order was passed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-reserves-order-on-arnab-goswami-s-plea-to-quash-firs/story-e5EINevraU1hvGsYFdmOfO.html
12-06-2020||Noida||Noida malls remain deserted on the first weekend after reopening||Even the weekend failed to draw visitors to shopping malls of Noida and Greater Noida, which were permitted to reopen four days ago.While more retailers have resumed operations, the mall managers expect a week’s time for the footfall to pick up. Meanwhile, some of the big shopping malls, including DLF Mall of India and the Great India Place in Sector 18, are yet to start functioning. Those managers of malls that are operational said their focus was to build the trust among visitors in a post-lockdown scenario to ensure that their shopping experience is a safe one. The shopping malls, hotels and restaurants of the city were allowed to reopen in the city from Monday.“Most of the brands have opened their outlets and within a few days, we will make the food court operational as well. The visitors have started to arrive, but we are yet to assess the footfall. The sales are picking up. Except for the children’s play area, all other facilities will be functional at the mall by next week,” Angad Makan, head, Logix City Centre mall, said.While the number of visitors seemed very few, malls have taken all necessary measures as directed by the state government, including regular sanitisation, ‘no mask no entry’ system, and thermal screening, among others. Since the visitor’s influx was low, social distancing is also not an issue.“More retailers are now opening shops. Yet, we expect that it will take another week at least for visitors to return in the usual numbers,” mall management at Gaur city mall, Greater Noida West, said.“The sales are low and we expect that it will take some time for it to pick up. Since the discounts are decided by the top management and not in our hands, the best we can do is provide customers the employee discount, especially on expensive articles such a watches,” said a sales executive at a multi-brand retail outlet at a mall.“We are still taking necessary steps like sanitisation before opening. We will take at least another week for us to reopen,” Shamim Anwar, PRO, Great India Place (GIP) mall in Sector 18, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-malls-remain-deserted-on-the-first-weekend-after-reopening/story-X85kR1vxPeDCillfjV3ZiJ.html
12-06-2020||City||New ventilators at Ghaziabad hospitals not being used, finds state observer||Ventilators sent by the Uttar Pradesh government last month to the Ghaziabad health department are yet to be utilised for the purpose of treating Covid-19 and non-Covid patients, the state observer found in an inspection earlier this month.Officials of the health department said three of the five new ventilators were meant for treating patients at the L2 category Covid-19 hospital at District Combined Hospital at Sanjay Nagar, while two new ventilators were given to MMG district hospital to treat non-Covid patients.According to the health department officials, five old ventilators and the three new ones wit the Sanjay Nagar hospital were not being used by the hospital authorities. The issue came to light during an inspection conducted by the state observer Dr VK Sonkar who was accompanied by chief development officer Asmita Lal.“The three new ventilators needed some equipment before they could start functioning, while the five old ones were functional but were not being used by the hospital authorities. It is now up to them to explain why they were not using the ventilators. The district authorities need to demand an explanation in the matter from the hospital,” Dr Sonkar said.Despite repeated calls, Dr Naresh Vij, chief medical superintendent, Sanjay Nagar hospital did not respond to queries regarding the matter on Friday. Chief development officer Asmita Lal did not take calls either.Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad, said the health department had observed that patients from the L2 category Sanjay Nagar hospital were being referred to the L3 category Covid-19 facility at Santosh Medical College and Hospital.“The Sanjay Nagar hospital authorities have healthcare staff trained in operating the ventilators, but despite this they have been referring the L2 patients to L3 hospital. We cannot say much about why they are not treating patients who need ventilator support. Out of the five new ventilators, three were given to them besides the five ventilators they already have,” Dr Gupta, said. Under UP’s three-tier Covid-19 facilities, L2 category hospitals treat patients with mild Covid-19 symptoms, while L3 category hospitals are for critical patients. The L1 category hospitals deal with asymptomatic patients.“We found out about the five old ventilators only when we were required to send the inventory of equipment to deal with Covid emergencies. Before we were preparing the list, the hospital authorities always mentioned that they have no ventilators,” Dr Gupta added.Two new ventilators were given to MMG Hospital on May 21 after the intervention of Atul Garg, UP’s state minister for health. “ We will make the two new ventilators functional by next week. They were running properly during trials, and we any equipment is needed for them, we will get it installed,” said Dr Anurag Bhargava, chief medical superintendent, MMG Hospital. The hospital had no ventilators prior to this.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that all ventilators will be made operational in the district hospitals and put to use soon.“The three new portable ventilators at the Sanjay Nagar hospital had some issues and have been made functional now, and the five old ones there will be operational by Saturday. We will also look into the operations of two new ventilators at MMG Hospital,” Pandey added.There have been 19 Covid-19 related deaths in Ghaziabad so far, and officials said patients who faced respiratory issues require ventilator support as well as oxygen supply.“All Covid hospitals, including L2 and L3 facilities, are fully equipped with oxygen,” the CMO added.In Ghaziabad, the 100-bedded Sanjay Nagar hospital is the only L2 hospital. The L3 facility has set up at Santosh Medical College which is a private establishment but has been acquired by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-ventilators-at-ghaziabad-hospitals-not-being-used-finds-state-observer/story-5hd7yV3um9U9DZ40bADeVI.html
12-06-2020||Mumbai||DRI seizes cigarettes worth ₹12 crore smuggled from Dubai||The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Mumbai zone officials have seized foreign brand cigarettes worth around ₹12 crore while they were being smuggled into the country from Dubai. The seized cigarettes were concealed in the container full of cartons of dates (Khajur). Two members involved in the racket have been arrested for creating dummy companies to facilitate the smuggling.DRI officials said that since there was a huge demand for cigarettes because of its unavailability due to lockdown of over 75 days, the syndicate was trying to smuggle a huge consignment to make a huge profit. The official claimed that the seized consignment of smuggled foreign brand cigarettes is one of the biggest in recent times.According to the DRI officials, they had received a tip-off about a large number of cigarettes of various foreign brands being smuggled into India through an import consignment that arrived at Navkar Corporation Ltd, a container freight station at Nhava Sheva. Based on this specific intelligence DRI team carried out a raid on June 10.The officials recovered 32,640 cartons containing 71,61,600 cigarettes sticks of foreign origin of various brands worth over ₹11 crore. The same was seized under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962.The subsequent investigation led to the arrest of Manish Sharma, 31, andSunil Laxman Waghmare, 29, on Friday. “Both are Chembur residents and were instrumental in creating dummy companies which would be used in smuggled activities. The two were looking after all the paperwork for the syndicate. They collected documents such as electricity bill, copy of PAN card, Aadhar card and photographs of different persons. They provided these documents to the members of the smuggling syndicate, for the opening of fake companies and to obtain GST number and import and export code (IEC),” said a senior DRI official.The accused persons had also allegedly arranged the fake documents used in the import of the container having smuggled cigarettes in the present case. Documents arranged by them were used for the creation of dummy companies several times in the past and they had been doing this for monetary considerations. They would also be charged with sections of forgery in future, DRI officer said.Another senior DRI officer said we need to investigate the role of other key persons based in other cities in the country, involved with them, which appear to be operating at the international level.However, advocate Ravi Hirani representing the two arrested accused said that the two are innocent and they have just submitted documents for clearance. “They had no knowledge about the smuggling of cigarettes. They have been made a scapegoat by the central law enforcement agency,” claims Hirani.A local court on Friday sent the two accused to judicial custody till June 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dri-seizes-cigarettes-worth-12-crore-smuggled-from-dubai/story-797jzdR3sxYgwCocNmcQuI.html
12-06-2020||City||Ghaziabad sees threefold increase in containment zones in 11 days||Amid the rising Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad, the number of containment zones in the district has seen a three-fold increase between May 30 and June 9. Now, about 10-11 lakh people are under the containment zones, health officials said. The officials also said that the number of containment zones in Ghaziabad may rise as June has seen a sudden spike in number of Covid-19 cases.According to the health department data, the district on May 30 had 72 containment zones, including 65 under category 1 and seven under category 2. The figure till June 9 has shot up to 217, with 188 containment zones under category 1 and 29 under category 2. “The number of containment zones will rise as some cases are coming up in new localities ever since the economic activities have opened up. Our teams are trying to take up sanitization, surveillance and random sampling in containment zones in order to prevent any spread, and also to find our if there is any possibility of community spread,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.Till May 31, the district had a total of 305 Covid-19 cases, which jumped to 581 on Friday with the addition of 16 new cases. Of 581 positive cases, 368 patients have been discharged from different hospitals and 19 have lost their lives, resulting in 194 active cases in the district. The total sampling count as on June 11 was 12,710, the officials said.The officials said that five cases were reported from Garima Garden in Sahibabad, two from Indirapuram, and one each from Vaishali and Khoda, among other localities.According to the officials, they have also taken up about 1,000 random sampling which also included pool samples in different containment zones, but no Covid-19 positive cases have emerged.“This shows that there is no community spread as such, and containment exercises have yielded results. There is hardly any instance where cases have re-emerged in containment zones. The areas are contained for a period of 14 to 21 days and released if there are no fresh cases,” Dr Gupta added.If any area has one Covid-19 case, it is notified as the category 1 containment zone with a radius of 250 metres. The category-2 zones are the ones where there is incidence of more than one positive case. In such zones, area of 500-metre radius is under containment, with additional 250 metres of buffer area. The majority of activities, including movement of residents, in containment zones are restricted (except for essential supplies).According to the officials, the majority of containment zones (about 85-90%) are in city areas, and of these most are in trans-Hindon localities of Sahibabad, Khoda, Vaishali, Indirapuram, Vasundhara and Jhandapur, among others.The Sahibabad area, that includes localities like Shalimar Garden, Lajpat Nagar, Rajendra Nagar, Mohan Nagar and Bhopra among others, has 19 category 1 containment zones, while Vaishali has 13 category 1 containment zones and three category 2. Vasundhara has 16 category 1 zones and one category 2 zone. Indirapuram has eight areas under category 1 while three under category 2. The Khoda locality has the highest 30 category 1 zones and two category 2 zones.According to the health officials, they are taking up sealing of 20 areas and de-sealing of about 13 areas on an average per day.Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, president of flat owners’ federation, said, “The containment zones will now rise and it becomes vital that there should be no delay in sealing and de-sealing the areas. Otherwise, local residents will face issues. Likewise, the sampling activities should also be scaled up to prevent the spread of Covid-19.” Meanwhile, UP health department officials on Friday said that surveillance activities across the state have been taken up through which 892,214 households with a population of about 4.54 crore were surveyed.“A number of people in the state have won the battle against Covid-19 and have been discharged. We would request them to act as volunteer and spread awareness in society about measures which need to be taken up for fighting Coronavirus,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health).He said that the recovery rate in UP is about 60.31%.The Ghaziabad district on Friday recorded 16 fresh Covid-19 positive cases and the final tally till Friday stood at total of 581 cases. These included 368 discharged from different hospitals, 194 active cases and 19 deaths so far.The officials said that five cases were reported from Garima Garden in Sahibabad, two from Indirapuram, one each from Vaishali and Khoda among other localities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-sees-threefold-increase-in-containment-zones-in-11-days/story-djVPUNChmEUlPby8FWXQTO.html
12-06-2020||Mumbai||Civic body to get flooding alert three days in advance||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will now be aware of the possible extent of flooding in Mumbai three days prior to heavy rain events while 12-hour advance warnings will be issued for areas susceptible to flooding across all 24 wards this monsoon.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday inaugurated the integrated flood warning system for Mumbai (iFLOWS-Mumbai), the second one for any urban city in the country so far after Chennai, jointly conceived by various departments of the Union ministry of earth sciences (MoES) and BMC. Apart from forecasting location-specific rainfall across pockets in each ward, the system will allow the civic body to issue alerts for citizens and also evacuate people from low-lying areas in advance before heavy rain events occur.“This warning system is a gift (vardaan) to the people of Mumbai. As we deal with a health crisis as well as the recent Cyclone Nisarga, both blood and flood management are equally important,” said Thackeray, adding, “Over the past 15 years (2005-2020), Mumbai has managed to augment its pumping stations to drain water from low lying areas. The newly launched system will further enhance our efforts to address flooding concerns.”BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said early information on flood-prone areas would allow swift diversion of public transport and give BMC enough time to implement mitigation measures. “We are launching the project before the monsoon sets in over Mumbai. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) will be providing us with heavy rain warnings three days in advance. The system was developed based on classified and non-classified ward-wise information, elevation levels etc provided by BMC to IMD,” said Chahal.As of February 2020, 204 of 273 sites prone to waterlogging were attended to by BMC while remaining 69 sites continue to be unattended due to less manpower owing to Covid-19 pandemic, said a senior official from BMC’s storm water drains department.“On the day of flooding, we will be getting near real-time information and six-hour warning updates from IMD, giving us enough time to move our machinery towards affected areas. This can be a model for the rest of the country and will help make Mumbai become more resilient,” said Chahal.The city faced two major flooding events over the past 15 years. On August 29, 2017, Mumbai witnessed downpour of 315.8 mm rain in a span of just 12 hours that battered the city leading to suspended transport operations and severe waterlogging. It was even worse on July 26, 2005 when torrential showers led to a deluge that killed over 1,000 people when Mumbai had recorded 688 mm rain over a span of 12 hours, and 944mm over 24 hours — the highest all time rainfall recorded in the city.“These two events are etched in everyone’s memory, not just in Mumbai but across India. This highly-advanced flood warning system will help ensure that mitigation measures for such disasters are planned and addressed in a systematic manner,” said Union health and earth sciences minister Dr Harsh Vardhan.Meanwhile, scientists explained how iFLOWS-Mumbai system comprises seven components. The first module, which is data assimilation, collates weather information from IMD including advance forecasts as well as three to six hour immediate weather updates (Nowcast) and under-water depth of rivers (Mithi, Oshiwara, Poisar, and Dahisar) and lakes across Mumbai. It also takes into account location and elevation data provided by BMC for all 24 wards and develop maps.The second component — inundation — uses the data to forecast the probability of location wise floods three days in advance. This helps authorities assess the extent of flooding (including heavy rain, storm surge, high tide river bank breach etc.) and areas expected to be inundated. “The next three components — vulnerability, risks, and decision support system — allows the authorities to assess the situation, draw up a plan, and take decisions based on available information. Lastly, the dissemination module ensures swift communication to field officers to implement mitigation measures on ground,” said Dr MV Ramana Murthy, director, National Centre for Coastal Research, Chennai.“This sophisticated system will be further enhanced with rain information from 160 rain gauges (currently there are 120 rain gauges), and the development of a C-Band Doppler weather radar, which is likely to be installed within the next three to four months,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, MoES. “Four more X-Band weather radars are expected to be set up next year. Combined with the present infrastructure, this will provide quantum of rain for every 500 metres every 15 minutes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/civic-body-to-get-flooding-alert-three-days-in-advance/story-6J3T8j8MC29glXw8XBrqFL.html
12-06-2020||Noida||GB Nagar begins mass sampling drive to detect suspected Covid-19 cases||The Gautam Budh Nagar administration on Friday started taking samples of general public at various government hospitals and primary health centres (PHCs) across the district. The move is aimed at identifying the suspected Covid-19 patients and treating them well on time, officials said. However, the district administration has decided to carry out the sampling drive in a systematic manner to maintain a proper schedule. The officials said that anyone can call at helpline -- 18004192211 -- and register for testing.“The sampling will be done as per schedule, which will be prepared on the basis of requirement. All government hospitals and primary health centres are engaged in this task. Our aim is to provide required medical aid to a needy person on time,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, GB Nagar. According to the officials, anyone who wants to get tested will have to call the helpline where his/her details will be collected. And subsequently the medical staff will prepare a schedule as to when a particular person can visit a hospital or a PHC. “Then at the hospital or the PHC, doctors will, on the basis of symptoms or data, decide whether a Covid-19 test needs to be conducted or not. If it is needed, then an appointment will be fixed to ensure the needy do not face inconvenience,” said Suhas.The administration has started taking samples at Bisrakh community hospital in Greater Noida, community health centre Dadri, community health centre Bhangel in Noida Sector 110 , new building district hospital in Noida Sector 39, district combined hospital in Noida Sector 30, and PHCs at Dankaur and Jewar.“Anyone who wants to get tested first need to call and register compulsorily, because we do not want people to gather at health facilities in large numbers,” said Suhas. Several resident bodies and the Noida employees’ association (NEA) have welcomed the district administration’s decision about taking samples of common public. “We have been demanding of testing of street vendors, security guards and people engaged in other services. Now, with this sampling drive all who suspected themselves of infection can get tested,” said Sanjeev Kumar, an office bearer of Sector 51 residents’ welfare association.NEA, which represents the government employees in the city, demanded that all those engaged in providing essential services, including vegetables, medicine, milk and sanitation, among others, should also be tested as they are more vulnerable. “We welcome the administration’s move of sampling general public. This facility will allow common man to get tested and take precautions on the basis of test report. We have been demanding for tests for a long time,” said Dharmendra Sharma, vice-president, NEA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-begins-mass-sampling-drive-to-detect-suspected-covid-19-cases/story-VXtBwigiQa37IZW6orVV7K.html
12-06-2020||Noida||Residents support decision to seal Noida-Delhi border to prevent Covid 19 spread||Even as the Uttar Pradesh government Friday informed the Supreme Court that it will have to continue to restrict traffic from Noida and Ghaziabad to Delhi as Covid-19 cases in the national capital are 40 times that of Gautam Budh Nagar (Noida) and Ghaziabad, residents have started supporting the Gautam Budh Nagar administration and the district police commissioner’s joint decision to continue sealing the Delhi-Noida border.Residents have started a campaign to support the border sealing on the grounds that ‘life is more important than the livelihood’. They said if the Noida-Delhi border is opened, then Covid-19 would rise manifold in Noida, Greater Noida and other areas. Until now, many residents were criticising the decision to seal the border and demanding seamless travel from Uttar Pradesh to the national capital so that they can carry on with their work and business smoothly.“Things have changed and the situation in Delhi is now almost out of control -- Covid-19 cases re rising rapidly may be due to the higher population density. Since we share the border with Delhi, allowing unrestricted travel may lead to a rapid rise in Covid-19 cases in Noida too. Therefore, we support the decision to continue sealing the border for safety purposes,” NP Singh, president, Gautam Budh Nagar district development residents’ welfare association (DDRWA), a residents’ group, said. The DDRWA has also written to the UP government, police and district magistrate expressing its support to the move.The UP government informed the Supreme Court that it is allowing the movement of those with valid passes and those engaged in essential services, including media persons and advocates.“We hope that the strict restrictions at the Noida-Delhi border will also be implemented inside the city. We urge the police and the administration to ensure that all citizens follow the protocols seriously. Strict legal must be initiated against those who violate the norms laid down by the government,” Sanjeev Kumar, general secretary, Sector 51 residents’ welfare association, said.“If the Ghaziabad-Delhi is opened, then people may misuse the relaxations and cause the further spread of Covid-19. Restrictions may help in containing the spread of Covid-19,” Hem Prakash, a resident of ATS Advantage, Indirapuram, Ghaziabad, said.“Ghaziabad localities such as Surya Nagar, Kaushambhi, Khoda and other adjoining areas will be prone to a rise in cases if restrictions at Delhi-Ghaziabad border are lifted,” Girish Chauhan, a resident of Makanpur, Nyay Khand-II, Ghaziabad, said. The Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said, “We will follow the instructions of the state government on the issue of restrictions at the Noida-Delhi border.”“The better the understanding and awareness of the mode of transmission, symptoms and isolation of those found positive, the fairer the results would be. We are taking strict legal action to implement the rules,” Alok Singh police commissioner, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/residents-support-decision-to-seal-noida-delhi-border-to-prevent-covid-19-spread/story-j88nbiVYuvLWONI45lCzlI.html

12-06-2020||Football||We will meet all obligations: Quess to East Bengal||East Bengal’s former investors Quess Corp on Friday rubbished allegations of non-payments to its players and said they are a responsible corporate group and will meet all “obligations”.“We would like to clarify that we are a responsible corporate and our obligations to all will be met. We have been working closely with our representatives in Kolkata to ensure that this transition happens smoothly and with minimal discomfort,” the Bangalore-based group said in a statement.One month into the COVID-19 lockdown, the club applied the ‘force maejeure’ clause, thus, terminating their contracts in advance and purportedly sent eviction notice to some of their players in May.Five players including Abhishek Ambekar, Pintu Mahata and Rakshit Dagar then sent notice to Quess asking for salaries for the month of April and May.Terming the allegations unverified, it further said: “It has come to our notice that there are untoward allegations, most of them unverified, doing the rounds on how players of the football club have been denied their salaries as an outcome of the termination of the agreement between Quess Corp and EBFC.”East Bengal have terminated their tie-up with Quess Corp, who had a 70 per cent stake in the club.Both the parties had a three-year deal but the Bengaluru-based investors exited in two years.There is little clarity on the exit strategy between the two parties and whether the sporting rights, currently enjoyed by the joint venture, has been transferred back to the club.This has led to further speculation that East Bengal may not be able to take part in Calcutta Football League and IFA Shield.The All India Football Federation (AIFF) had also asked East Bengal to clarify the ownership structure following Quess’ exit to clear AFC’s club licensing criteria.“The formalities pertaining to the termination of the JV agreement between Quess, QEBFC and EBFC is underway and is expected to be completed soon. While Quess will do everything to protect the value of its shareholders, we will uphold the future of the game and its supporters,” it added.The century-old club is currently in desperate lookout for new investors in their bid to follow arch-rivals Mohun Bagan into joining the Indian Super League.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/football/we-will-meet-all-obligations-quess-to-east-bengal/story-T8yeOI5TX8yJm1xL6kZlvJ.html

12-06-2020||Gurugram||Residents across city oppose isolation facilities for Covid patients inside sectors||Residents across the city have opposed the setting up of isolation centres in densely populated areas as they fear the spread of Covid-19 — that has so far affected 2,737 people and killed 19 — in their community. The latest to join the clamour are residents of sector 45, who on Friday said they had opposed the opening of an isolation centre at a guest house by a private hospital in their area. The residents wrote a letter to the district administration saying that operating a guest house in the area was against rules and would put the lives of colony residents at risk. Earlier on Thursday residents of South City 1 and Sainikhaira village had opposed the proposal of setting up isolation centres in their colonies.Amir Singh Yadav, president, sector 45 RWA, in a letter to the deputy commissioner, Gurugram, stated that Max Hospital was planning to set up a Covid-19 care centre in their area. Yadav in his letter said that after deliberations with the governing body and residents it was conveyed to the representative of the hospital that this being a residential area, no hospital and similar activity could be allowed as it is prohibited under HSVP and DTCP rules. “We request kindly ensure that such activity is not allowed in our sector,” Yadav said in his letter.Local residents of the area said that the house, which has been identified to be used as an isolation centre, is located on a 10-metre road inside the sector and it is against the rules to even operate a guesthouse in the area. “This building is not located on a sector road, where guest houses can operate. Such activities in residential areas can cause panic among residents who are already scared by the rapid spread of Covid,” said Sanjeev Saxena, an area resident.Another resident said that instead of setting up isolation centres in the middle of residential sectors, authorities should set up these facilities in commercial areas like sector 29, which have several hotels but scant population.Earlier on Thursday, the residents of South City 1 and Sainikhera had sent a similar plea and asked the district administration to shift an isolation centre, which was located on the main access road of the village, elsewhere. RS Jakhar, an area resident said that the government should convert its own guest houses and facilities into isolation centres, instead of putting the lives of residents in danger.Last month, the residents of DLF Phase 2 had also opposed the setting up of an isolation centre in their area after which officials had shelved the plan.As per government records, 14 isolation centres have been set up in the city, which are both self-paid as well as government paid. Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram on Thursday had said that he would look into the issue and if there is a genuine problem, he will get it resolved.Hari Om Atri, joint commissioner, Municipal Commission of Gurugram, who is the concerned official did not respond to repeated calls and messages for a comment on the issue.A spokesperson from Max hospital said ,” The OYO Studio Apartment facility in Sector 45 was notified as a Covid isolation facility by the Gurugram administration on June 5. We were informed that Max Hospital will be responsible for setting up and running the facility. When our team went there to take over the hotel and set up operations, there was resistance from the local RWA. We have informed Gurugram authorities about this and are awaiting further directions from them. The facility isn’t operational as yet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/residents-across-city-oppose-isolation-facilities-for-covid-patients-inside-sectors/story-3yYg4vN3BiS2Rxwr53fbKO.html

However, fake notes of Rs500 and Rs2,000 are easily available, according to shop owners in the city.Among the fake notes worth Rs 87,05,75,000 seized in a joint operation by the Pune police and Military Intelligence (MI) on Wednesday, notes worth Rs 31,80,00,000 were of Rs 1,000 denomination. Along with the Rs 1,000 notes, 1,52,000 notes of Rs 500 denomination and 2,17,100 notes of Rs 2,000 denomination were also found in their possession.“The Rs 1,000 notes are not available at all. Even for the other notes, people come to us for these notes very rarely. The sale is not even 5 per cent of the total sale of the shop. Every bundle of 100 notes of any denomination costs around Rs 30-35. Now even the board games have started using plastic chips or credit and debit cards. So we hardly have to purchase these notes,” said Sachin Kulkarni, owner of a toy station at Kunte chowk.“Whenever required, multiple suppliers are available in Ravivar peth. Most of the toy shop owners take notes from them,” said Viral Shah, owner of Maahi toy shop in Camp.“Very few customers ask for a set of notes for a school project or something like that. The Rs 1,000 notes are not made or even in demand. During lockdown we could not even source these notes as we usually do from Ravivar peth,” said the owner of Toy and Joy shop on Laxmi road on condition of anonymity.In the local market, one set of ten different denominations, including Rs 1, Rs 2, Rs 5, of notes can be bought for Rs 20. The notes clearly mention Children’s Bank of India in Hindi followed by English.According to salient security features described by the Reserve Bank of India tender banknotes have electrotype watermark and Mahatma Gandhi image which can be seen on the blank white strip. The same is missing in the Children’s Bank notes. This is one of the easiest ways of checking whether a note is genuine or not.The Reserve Bank of India emblem, which has a tiger in it, is replaced with the word ‘COLOURS’ with each alphabet printed in a different colour. This is true for Rs 500 as well as Rs 2,000 notes.The text in the language panel on the backside of the Rs 500 note is also altered in the children’s notes. In another major difference in the Rs 500 as well as the Rs 2,000, the Ashoka pillar is missing in the Children’s Bank notes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fake-currency-racket-rs-1-000-children-s-bank-notes-rare-in-local-toy-stores/story-Vo2j47IpJQU46nII3QAUhJ.html

Special judge Arvind Malhotra granted bail to Prithvi Singh after he had been remanded in five-day police custody. He was released on conditional bail. The anticipatory bail pleas of now suspended director (health services) Dr Ajay Kumar Gupta and his wife were dismissed by the court after hearing arguments of the bureau. The state vigilance and anti-corruption bureau probing the Himachal Pradesh health department scam has found that employees of a Punjab-based firm colluded with Dr Ajay Kumar Gupta to secure orders for supplying personal protective equipment (PPE) kits for corona warriors.The scam surfaced on May 20 after an audio clip of a conversation between Dr Gupta and Prithvi Singh, a representative for a medical equipment supplier in Punjab, was widely shared on social media. In the 43-second audio clip, Dr Gupta is heard asking Prithvi, 46, for a bribe of ₹5 lakh to seal the deal.After Gupta’s arrest, the vigilance department had sent Dr Gupta’s and Prithvi’s mobile phones for investigation to the Central Forensic Laboratory at Junga. Dr Ajay Gupta was arrested on May 28, which triggered state BJP Chief Rajeev Bindal to quit his post.The forensic examination of the phones revealed that there were three more audio recordings between Prithvi, an agent of Bioaide Corporation, and Dr Gupta that were related to the supply of PPEs.Vigilance sleuths found that Singh was seeking one more supply order of PPE kits from Dr Ajay Kumar Gupta before the issue of tender so that both could make gains but no supply order could be carried out as by then the state government decided that Covid-19 purchases will be made through tenders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-health-dept-scam-punjab-firm-employee-gets-bail/story-wUViww9R8bFGiYXwaFabBM.html

IPS officer Sukhchain Singh Gill is Amritsar police commissioner. He had passed MBBS from a local Government Medical College before joining IPS.“Covid-19 is a biological crisis. If one has medical knowledge, he/she are helpful to protect the force and society from the outbreak,” said IPS officer and MBBS holder Simrat Kaur, who is acting as ADCP (headquarters). Her duty is deployment and welfare of the police who are acting as frontline warriors.ADC (general) Himanshu Aggarwal (IAS) also has an MBBS degree and plays a key role in management of the anti-pandemic operations.Another IAS Pallavi Choudhry, who is ADC (development), is BDS graduate.

12-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police strengthening its presence on social media for public outreach: SN Shrivastava||After taking over as the chief of Delhi Police, S N Shrivastava’s thrust has been to strengthen the force’s presence on various social platforms, especially Twitter to reach out to people, which has elicited praise from common man and celebrities alike. The police chief says the force is gradually working to “improve their presence on social media”. Delhi Police currently enjoys a following of over 5.33 lakh on Twitter while Shrivastava’s handle has over 2.33 lakh followers. The Mumbai Police, which is known for its wit and humour on social media, has a following of 50,00,000 while Bengaluru Police, which is also active on the micro-blogging website, has almost 13 lakh followers.The Delhi Police’s Facebook page has garnered 33,650 likes so far while on Instagram, it has 3,892 followers and has 80 posts. Mumbai police has 1,43,000 followers with 86 posts on Instagram. “If somebody is trying to put out a negative narrative about Delhi police, we need to correct it and set a positive narrative about the force. So, for all these things, we need the social media cell which is gradually improving,” he told PTI over phone. This emphasis on social media came in handy during the coronavirus-triggered lockdown when Delhi Police came up with a campaign -- ‘Dil Ki Police’ -- to highlight the humanitarian efforts of its personnel. To thank ‘corona warriors’, the force organised a virtual concert ‘Dil Se Shukriya’ last month, which witnessed the participation of celebrities, including Shankar Mahadevan, Usha Uthup and Harshdeep Kaur. Even Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan had tweeted about the concert. Shrivastava said while praises and endorsements by celebrities are welcome, it is the praise of the common man that is “heartening” for the force. “Besides the celebrities, in fact it was very heartening to me to see likes, good posts and praises from common man. It is the common man who need our help and if they are praising and are happy with the police, then our job is done. Of course, celebrities are privileged people, so they definitely will be looked after but the common man should also be looked after,” he said. Shrivastava’s twitter handle @cpdelhi has also started responding to queries and requests for help, which he said has been possible due to his social media cell. “I can’t be much active on social media. My work demands that I look after other things as well but then I am on social media whenever I get time, especially late during the night. I attend to some of them but it may not be sufficient. “So, we have set up a social media cell and a separate account of CP Delhi. @CPDelhi is handled by my social media cell and any request made to my official CP Delhi twitter handle - any request made besides some of which I take care, my social media cell responds to it and ensures something is done,” he said. The police chief said the handle receives all kinds of requests, with some even asking for information on how to get back home while some ask for employment which the police may not be able to provide. “But if we can do something, we will do. But any request regarding something to do with crime and law and order, we are duty bound to do,” he said. The social media cell has police personnel along with paid volunteers from a firm, he said. “They can do the work only when they are also assisted by the police,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-strengthening-its-presence-on-social-media-for-public-outreach-sn-shrivastava/story-HNyYDSuzmWGOCAUQ43k5uM.html

No one was wearing masks and people were huddled on the slopes of hills. If there is even a single positive case among them, it will prove disastrous for thousands,” said a local.“Isn’t it strange that on one hand the administration has imposed restrictions on the movement of people and normal life remains crippled and on the other 3,000 people attend a bull race,” he added.On Friday, Rajouri recorded its first Covid-19 death after a 65-year-old man from Nangala village in Sial Sui panchayat succumbed to the infection. Till Thursday, Rajouri had 57 positive cases with 45 active cases and 12 recoveries.Another local said the organisers had brought bulls and competitors.“There was drum beating and trumpets were being blown. It was sheer madness. Wasn’t this a serious lapse on the part of the administration,” he asked.When contacted, a senior police officer said, “We have taken cognizance of the matter and an FIR has been registered. Investigation has been initiated.”Jammu and Kashmir has so far reported 4,574 positive cases that include 53 deaths — six in Jammu region and 47 in Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/social-distancing-goes-for-a-toss-as-bull-race-attracts-3-000-spectators-in-j-k-s-rajouri/story-xTwHyrOVxmAN7iobkVY8lK.html
12-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s new flood warning system launched, CM calls it ‘boon’||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday inaugurated the new integrated flood warning system (IFLOWS) developed for Mumbai, calling it a “boon” for the city.Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Science and Technology, and Earth sciences, who was also present during the ceremony, said the system will help the people of Mumbai in a “big way” as it can predict floods.The Ministry of Earth Sciences, using in-house expertise and in close coordination with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), has developed this system.“The flood management system is a boon for the city and it will be helpful in saving Mumbai,” Thackeray said via video-conference after the launch.“As Maharashtra had received warning about cyclonic storm Nisarga 2-3 days in advance, the state government could shift people to safer locations and hence there was hardly any loss of human life,” he said.Cyclone Nisarga had made landfall near Alibaug in Raigad district of the state last week.He said that some areas of Mumbai are below the sea level, due to which the sea water enters the city during the high tide.“Therefore since 2005, several pumping stations have been built in the city, which stops ingress of water and also pumps it out of the city,” he said.On July 26, 2005, Mumbai had witnessed one of its worst floods when the city had received 944 mm rainfall in a single day.Thackeray also called for the need to have four Doppler radars in the city.He said the BMC was the first civic body in the country to build its own molecular lab after Leptospirosis outbreak in the city.The chief minister said that the government has increased the number of COVID-19 testing labs to 85 from two earlier. “Soon the number will be increased to 100,” he added.In a lighter vein, Thackeray told Harsh Vardhan, “Like this system, give us early warning about approaching political storms.” IFLOWS-Mumbai has been developed as a state-of-the-art flood warning system for Mumbai to enhance the resilience of Mumbai by providing early warning for flooding specially during high rainfall events and cyclones, an official statement said.Using this, it will be possible to have an estimate of the flood inundation three days in advance, along with immediate weather updates, it added.Harsh Vardhan said that the IFLOWS system was “one of the most advanced” ones, which would help the people of Mumbai.“The hi-tech system will predict floods before they occur, therefore enabling Mumbaikars to take due precautions in advance. This will be a boon for Mumbai, a city that has been experiencing floods with increasing periodicity,” he said.“Mumbai floods, especially that occurred in 2005 and 2017 are etched in everyone’s memory. This highly-advanced flood warning system will help the people of Mumbai in a big way. A similar system was already developed by MoES and is in operation at Chennai,” he said.“In the 2004 tsunami, we lost lakhs of lives, in absence of an early warning system. But now, India has developed an early tsunami warning system for the whole world and UNESCO has asked India to help other countries in early tsunami warning,” the minister said.“Since the last many years, India has never given any false alarm on this particular issue. This tsunami warning service has also been extended to the countries in Indian Ocean Region who are being highly benefited,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-new-flood-warning-system-launched-cm-calls-it-boon/story-j5tidWAjb8jbDSpDQmWn5L.html

They demanded “unmasking of the real kingpin of the seed scam” and condemned the Congress government for “trying to give the scam a quiet burial.”In a statement, SAD’s newly-appointed farmer wing president Sikander Singh Maluka said, “It is strange that even though the CM had asked the finance department and Sugarfed to clear Rs 299 crore dues to sugarcane farmers, no effort are being made to direct the private sugar mills to clear the outstanding dues.”“While private sugar mills owe farmers Rs 383 crore on account of sugarcane procured in 2018-19 and 2019-20, they had not been paid dues even after end of 2019-20,” Maluka said.He said as per the Sugarcane Control Order and Clause 3(3) of the Sugarcane Purchase and Regulation Act, sugar mills should make payments within 14 days of purchase of sugarcane or pay interest on late payment. He said that accordingly all pending dues of farmers should be cleared along with interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/clear-rs-383-crore-dues-of-sugarcane-growers-sad-to-captain/story-e5295h346T1O2bI4D95xkI.html

However, only 50 percent shops will be allowed to run on alternate days.Despite the district being a red zone, Srinagar’s district disaster management authority (DDMA) gave traders a go-ahead, as per suggestions from health experts, after deliberations with various business organisations in the valley.“The trade organisations will ensure that all standard operating procedures are observed for permissible 50% opening of shops in line with the state executive committee (SEC) notification,” read the order signed by Srinagar deputy commissioner Shahid Choudhary, who is the chairman of DDMA, on Friday.Of Kashmir’s 10 districts, the SEC chaired by chief secretary BVR Subrahmanyam on Sunday had classified eight, including Srinagar, as red zones, while Ganderbal and Bandipora were put in orange category. The SEC allowed the opening of business complexes in red districts with 50% shops on alternate days. It also allowed home delivery of food by restaurants and opening of salons and barber shops.As per the new DDMA order, essential products and services like bookshops, chemists, grocery, fruit/vegetable shops, milk, meat, repair workshops, hotels (home delivery) and bakery, will be allowed full-time on weekdays.Non-essential shops selling readymade garments/cloth, cosmetics, footwear, electronics, jewellery, tailors, designers and boutiques will operate from 11am to 5.30pm on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.On Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, handicrafts, handloom, hardware building material, furniture, furnishing, automobiles, service stations and salons will open.The order states that concerned market associations shall be responsible for observance of SOPs in market areas.“Wearing masks and physical distancing shall be mandatory.

12-06-2020||City||After scores of complaints, state to examine deletion of ration cards||The state authorities have decided to initiate a verification drive of ration cardholders after complaints that many eligible families were left out in the last one year.In an order released on June 10, food civil supplies and consumer affairs department director Anindita Mitra asked the district food and civil supply controllers (DFSCs) to reregister eligible persons into the database.The communiqué directed officials to ensure that no eligible person is denied ration under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY). Mitra was unavailable for comments on the matter.Joint director (food distribution and supply branch) Sona Singh said the order is a routine practice and the field staff has not been given any deadline to submit details on the wrongly deleted ration cards.However, official sources said deletion of their names deprived many of foodgrain under the public distribution system (PDS). A department functionary said that following suspicion of the presence of ‘ghost’ beneficiaries, last year the state government had decided to re-verify the registered families.Sources said in a drive started on April 1 last year, names of more than 2.5 lakh ration cardholders were deleted.Bathinda DFSC Mandeep Singh said, the district has 1.86 lakh ration cardholders and after afresh scrutiny, around 10,000 more might be included.“Deletion of names is primarily attributed to non-submission of papers required for ration cards. The field staff is to re-examine data of the left out members,” said an official.Since last few weeks, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders have been raising the issue. Party legislator from Talwandi Sabo and AAP national executive member Baljinder Kaur said political interference led to deletion of names.“Names of vocal non-Congress supporters in Bathinda, Mansa, Faridkot and other districts were dropped from the beneficiaries’ list. The grim situation was noticed during lockdown when underprivileged families were denied foodgrain as they were not ration cardholders,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-scores-of-complaints-state-to-examine-deletion-of-ration-cards/story-KZ9Es1ggTBr5EpMdFvi6cL.html

The latest challenge they face is to prevent spread of vector-borne diseases. The departments have formed special teams to detect larvae and sensitise locals.Recent showers in the region have led to accumulation of water which can result in mosquito breeding and subsequently dengue and malaria. “We are fighting corona, but now authorities are also worried about spread of dengue and malaria. We have started door-to-door drive,” said Kapurthala epidemiologist Dr Rajiv Bhagat.He said that over 30 houses were inspected by a team and mosquito breeding was found at three places.

The pilgrims will be cross-checked for the infection upon entry into J&K before they are allowed to undertake the yatra,” said an official requesting anonymity.The SASB is also looking to telecast the live aarti from the cave shrine in the morning and evening for the devotees, the official added.Another official said since it would be a curtailed yatra, the SASB is mulling to allow it via helicopters only.However, lieutenant governor’s principal secretary and SASB CEO Bipul Pathak said, “The board is yet to meet and take a decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amarnath-yatra-j-k-admn-may-allow-only-2-000-pilgrims-per-day/story-nYVhzXGApsCJS0EPhtSOOM.html

The petition said that the residents of these sectors had been paying Rs 5.25 per kilolitre for drinking water, whereas residents of sectors governed by MC paid Rs 1.8 per kilolitre. Pleading to the body to issue directions to GMADA to hand over the water supply system to MC, the petitioners also sought a refund of excess water tariff paid to GMADA from 2017 onwards.In June last year, the MC House had approved the agenda to take over the water supply system of new sectors, following which, on July 16, the Punjab local bodies department had approved the move. Later, GMADA asked MC to also take over the maintenance of sewerage and storm sewer system.Former councilor Shinderpal Singh (Bobby Kamboj) said despite MC passing a resolution to take over the water supply system, the government had yet to decide on it.He said GMADA had no justified reason to charge 5.5 times more water tariff as compared to other sectors of Mohali.Former councillor of Sector 80, Surinder Singh said, “We have been fighting for water tariff parity for the past one year, but GMADA has failed to give any relief.

He added that the state had already faced huge losses in four other power projects after installing the pipes purchased by the company.He has strongly demanded the state government to take disciplinary and punitive action on the expert committee constituted by the electricity board.Last month, about 30 persons engaged in a trial run of a hydroelectric station had a narrow escape when a water flow regulating channel gave way, deluging the powerhouse and damaging machines worth crores of rupees besides entrapping engineers and workers.Several men got entrapped in the powerhouse as the penstock a channel or pipe for conveying water to a hydroelectric station or waterwheel gave way,“It was very unfortunate to cancel the contract for construction of the project from Thapar and Thapar Company in 2001. If this contract was not cancelled, today, the project would have been ready,” said Sharma.He said that the purchase of pipes and the panel of expert reports have been made during the Congress regime.The Uhl stage-III hydropower project was commissioned in 2003 with an estimated cost of ₹431 crore with completion schedule of five years but the project is facing a serious threat of future investment of crores for its completion after the blast in the penstock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mandi-mp-smells-scam-in-uhl-iii-hydropower-project/story-iN5Q2M4r4v3D6vsdqbLxBK.html

He was the second Congress sarpanch to be killed by militants in south Kashmir in the last two years.Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress president Ghulam Ahmad Mir said that for the past several months, the party has been asking the government that panchayat members who are vulnerable to such attacks should be provided security cover, but nobody bothered.“After Pandita’s killing, we have been demanding security for panches and sarpanches on a daily basis, but still nothing has been done,” he said adding that Pandita had also requested for security many times, but was never provided any.Mir said, “Many panchayat members and other political leaders have received death threats, yet they are not being given security. We will be writing about this to the Centre after a meeting.”Complaining about the situation, Mir said after August 5 last year, when many mainstream leaders were arrested under PSA act, the security of several leaders, especially those from Congress, was downgraded. “I am a former minister, legislator and the current JKPCC president, but my security was also downgraded. In Jammu, I don’t have any security, and same is the case with other leaders of Congress and other mainstream political parties.”BJP had also sought security of panchayat members soon after Pandita’s death. “We have been demanding security for panchayat members for a long time, but to no avail,” said BJP’s J&K spokesperson and sarpanch Altaf Thakur.J&K director general of police Dilbag Singh had blamed the terrorists of Hizbul Mujahideen for Pandita’s killing stating that those responsible for the attack had been identified.However, the J&K administration has not disclosed if security cover will be provided to panchayat members in the Union territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sarpanch-killing-j-k-cong-demands-security-for-panchayat-members-vulnerable-to-attacks/story-BTI9qNdIS5WJ8kViqQJugI.html

The decision to set up the panel came days after the health department projected a surge in Covid-19 cases that could breach the 1,00,000-mark this month-end and touch 5 lakh by July-end.Hindustan Times had first reported on Wednesday that Baijal was looking at getting expert opinion on how the city could rapidly ramp up beds available for Covid-19 patients without compromising on the quality of medical care to patients.Also read: Lt Guv Baijal works on plan to scale up Covid-19 beds with community outreachThe six-member committee includes Indian Council of Medical Research director general Balram Bhargava, AIIMS director Randeep Guleria, and two members of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). The committee is expected to give the city government a clearer picture of its spread over the next few weeks and months.A Delhi government official told Hindustan Times that the projected shortage of beds had been a cause of serious concern. A statement issued by Raj Nivas later said Anil Baijal felt that the efforts being made by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority DDMA “need to be bolstered by concerted planning, use of latest technology, efficient monitoring and seamless coordination among various agencies to overcome the challenge”.At a meeting that he had chaired earlier in the day, Anil Baijal had expressed concerns around the health care infrastructure, telling officials that their first priority is to ramp up bed capacity and medical resources so that the surge in cases doesn’t overwhelm the healthcare system.The health department estimates that the city would need 1.5 lakh beds by July 31 when the Covid-19 count crosses 5 lakh. Delhi has all of nearly 58,000 hospital beds in the government and private sector.Also read | ‘Delhi L-G Baijal’s orders to be implemented’: CM Kejriwal on hospitals rowThe order to set up the committee comes just a day after the national capital recorded 1,877 new infections and 101 new fatalities. The city’s total tally has gone up to 34,687 Covid-19 cases. In all, 1,085 people have died due to Covid-19.Baijal is learnt to have taken note of the increase in the number of containment zones in the city and reviewed the government’s strategies. There are 242 containment zones at last count, up from about 100 three weeks back. Their number went up as more Covid-19 cases were reported from different parts of the city.“Our objective is to break the chain of transmission and reduce the morbidity and mortality of Covid-19,” Baijal said early in the meeting. The city’s case fatality rate – the proportion of infected persons who succumb to the illness – has risen to 3.13%, the highest it has been since March 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lt-guv-gets-expert-help-to-guide-delhi-s-covid-battle-ropes-in-chiefs-of-icmr-and-aiims/story-gi2z1vOXpfDnYPOH7kbvgO.html

Demanding that the store be shifted, the resident welfare association (RWA) has written to UT adviser Manoj Parida and municipal corporation (MC) commissioner KK Yadav.The tender for the liquor vend was allotted around six months ago and its construction is underway.RWA president Colonel Gursewak Singh (retd) said, “The proposed vend is quite close to two schools and the entry point of MHC, which will lead to traffic chaos.”“The authorities should reconsider opening the vend here. Even if it’s absolutely necessary, it should be shifted a few hundred metres away to near the Circus Ground,” said SA Qureshi, the RWA’s general secretary.In response, local area councillor Jagtar Singh Jagga said, “The liquor vend is at a sufficient distance from the residential area. It is also away from the market. The construction has already started, but I will speak to the residents and address their concerns.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/residents-protest-liquor-vend-outside-modern-housing-complex/story-xTSQUuS1AZxLIj2bv8EaeO.html

12-06-2020||Delhi||Breathless in Delhi: Ambulances with cylinder challenge for families, patients||The ambulance stopped at the GTB Hospital and Sarwar Ali sprang out and ran into the building, hoping to quickly get his unconscious wife admitted – the oxygen cylinder in the vehicle was running dangerously low and there was not a minute to waste.It had to be third time lucky if Miskeen Begum had to survive. After being refused admission in two hospitals, her life hinged on getting that bed in GTB Hospital. And if not, enough oxygen in ambulance to see her through to another hospital for another try at getting admitted.Three hospitals, several kilometres, many hours and just one cylinder. That was what it had come down to for a despairing Ali as he fought to save his wife.Suffering from chronic kidney disease and diabetes, Miskeen Begum had lost consciousness in the morning and her 57-year-old husband had run the rounds of hospitals. From their home in Khajuri Khas in northeast Delhi to the Jag Pravesh Hospital, which turned them away, then to the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences (IHBAS), which also said no, and finally to the Delhi government-run GTB Hospital.“She cannot be transported without any oxygen mask,” Ali, a weaver by profession, said, as he rushed through the paperwork on Thursday.Miskeen Begum finally got admission and Ali heaved a sigh of relief.But it was touch and go.As increasing number of stories emerge of patients being sent from one hospital to another in search of a vacant bed, accessing an ambulance equipped with enough oxygen to see the patients through the traumatic journey is rapidly turning into a huge challenge.The numbers seem adequate enough on paper.The Centralised Ambulance Trauma Services (CATS) of the Delhi government has nine Advanced Life Support (ALS) ambulances, 142 Basic Support Ambulances (BLS) and 109 Patient Transport Ambulances (PTA).Besides, 154 ambulances have also been converted to dedicated Covid-19 ambulances so the resources are divided between those suffering from the coronavirus infection and those with other diseases.However, while ALS and BLS ambulances have two oxygen cylinders, the PTAs are fitted with only one cylinder since the vehicles are small and there is not enough space. “Due to coronavirus, patients have to be taken to different hospitals. Admission of the patient takes a lot of time, sometimes even four hours. So, a lot of time goes in transit,” said Sanjay Tyagi, CATS programme officer.Private hospitals and several other institutes have their own ambulances. The fact that the vehicles need to be sanitised is another issue.Those operating Covid-19 ambulances have been given PPEs. Plus, the vehicle is either sanitised or fumigated after each trip, Tyagi said. The next call is only assigned after a break of 45 minutes. He denied that there was a shortage of oxygen cylinders. “Since a lot of time goes in transit these days, there could be a case that ambulances may not have been able to replenish the stock as our cylinders are kept at one central location.” It’s not always about a coronavirus patient but other health needs too.Also at GTB Hospital was 55-year-old Ashok Chauhan, who works for Uttar Pradesh’s Provincial Armed Constabulary and was brought from Meerut.He was suffering from typhoid and was also breathless. When doctors at GTB said it is a designated Covid facility and they can’t take him in, his family was faced with a fresh crisis – hunt for another hospital and an ambulance with a functional oxygen cylinder.The family arranged an ambulance, but the doctor warned them not to transport him in an ambulance without an oxygen cylinder.Chauhan’s two sons scrambled to arrange for one, rushing to each ambulance that drew up with patients at the hospital. They stopped the drivers to ask if their vehicles were equipped with oxygen and were free to transport their father.“Even an enemy should not go through the trouble we are facing,” Chauhan’s wife said, breaking into tears. After much running around, Chauhan’s son Birender managed an ambulance with a functional oxygen cylinder.The situation was not too different at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, another dedicated Covid-facility, in Dilshad Garden.Ashish Jain had brought his father Subhash who was suffering with pneumonia for a week. But doctors told him he was a suspected Covid-19 patient but had not yet tested positive and they could therefore not treat him.The super speciality hospital, they said, is meant for coronavirus positive patients.But Jain’s father could only be shifted to another hospital in an ambulance with a proper oxygen cylinder as he had respiratory issues.“There was an ambulance available, but it was only meant for Covid-patients. Since he is not a confirmed case of coronavirus, another ambulance is needed, but one with a proper oxygen cylinder,” Jain said as he scrambled to arrange for an ambulance.All for an ambulance with a properly functioning oxygen cylinder. As hapless families grapple with their ailing patients, endless bureaucracy and figure out which hospital they should go to, Covid-19 or not, that really has emerged as a big issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/breathless-in-delhi-ambulances-with-cylinder-challenge-for-families-patients/story-FuXmjrAI9yUuM3Ui7TK06J.html

He thanked his team as well as the people of the state for battling the virus.Coronavirus is here to stay, we must march onThe chief minister added that coronavirus may stay for a long time, “but we need to march on to keep the economy afloat.”He said that the country was in the Unlock Phase-I and accordingly public transport and other economic activities have started in the state.He said that the country, as well as the state, has benefited from the ₹20 lakh crore stimulus package announced by the Centre.Thakur also slammed the opposition Congress for playing politics at the hour of distress.He alleged that opposition leaders were nowhere to be seen during the crisis but tried to take political mileage in matters where some people were involved in corruption.“If we make mistakes, the opposition has a right to criticise us but it should be in a constructive way and not for political gains,” said the chief minister.Thakur said that his government also took swift action in matters where people were involved in corruption be it the sanitiser scam or bribery case involving the director of health services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-ready-to-meet-greater-covid-19-challenges-cm-jai-ram-thakur/story-0mZAadFkpsAQFXpCOlAEAN.html

12-06-2020||Chandigarh||My father was brave, I too have to be brave, says murdered Anantnag sarpanch’s daughter||Days after her father was killed by terrorists in Kashmir, Niyanta Pandita, daughter of sarpanch Ajay Pandita Bharti said she will follow her father’s footsteps.Ajay Pandita Bharti, a sarpanch in south Kashmir’s Anantnag, was shot from close range by terrorists and killed near his residence on Monday.Niyanta said the family, which is currently in Jammu, will soon be moving back to Kashmir.“My father was brave and I too have to be brave, we will not allow anybody to snatch our rights,” she said.She said the terrorists who shot her father had been cowardly. “They didn’t have the guts to face him,” she said. “They could have shot him in the chest, but they fired from behind, it is simply a case of cowardice,” she said.PANDITA HAD DEMANDED SECURITY She said her father had demanded security cover from the government after a sarpanch was killed in November last year. She said though no security was given, it didn’t deter or scare him from speaking for his people.She said if her father had been given security, and his concerns had not been left unheard, maybe his death could have been averted. She said the incident should serve as a lesson for the government. “The government should not take people’s concerns lightly,” she said.“My father wasn’t scared for himself, but was concerned about the safety of his family,” she said. “Whatever the government deems right regarding providing security to sarpanchs, it must do that, I don’t want a similar tragedy repeated in Kashmir,” she said.She said her father was elected sarpanch with the support of the people and had contested the elections on the insistence of the locals.‘SOMEBODY TIPPED OFF TERRORISTS’ “They trusted him, I don’t say that every person is bad there, but there are some bad people too, otherwise how could they (the terrorists) have known when he left the block and reached home, and then went outside,” she said.She said her father was not dependent on any party. He loved his country and worked for the upliftment of the people.“He was the son of the nation. He doesn’t belong to any party,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/my-father-was-brave-i-too-have-to-be-brave-says-murdered-anantnag-sarpanch-s-daughter-niyanta-pandita/story-5BtrOD1llRnEoG8mftwpQK.html
12-06-2020||Pune||Without domestic helps, senior citizens in Pune struggle to manage homes as housing societies follow safety rules||Pune Since the unlock 1.0 has started in Pune city, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has given several relaxations to the citizens. One of them is allowing domestic helps to come to work at home, specially for the senior citizens in the city. Still there are large number of elderly people who are not able to get the help from their domestic helps due to various reasons like domestic helps are coming from containment zones, housing societies not allowing or making stringent rules for them. HT spoke to some of the elderly couples around the city who are struggling without domestic helps in day to day life.Manohar Chobhe (83) and Suniti Chobhe (77) resident of Subhashnagar area, Tilak road“We both are living alone here in our house and after the lockdown started one by one all our domestic helps stopped coming for work. We had three domestic helps for different works in the house, as we both are not able to do anything on our own. But as they didn’t come, both of us divided the work between both of us and somehow managing to do the work. I have back pain and spondylosis problem, so cooking, cleaning utensils and washing clothes was very painful for me,” said Suniti Chobhe.While Manohar Chobhe said, “More than physical pain we both are going through mental pain allot during this crisis situation. Both our son and daughter are living in other states due to their work and cannot come here to help us. There were positive cases found in our area, so domestic helps or any other people were banned to come here. We are just hoping that this lockdown ends soon and maids come back for work taking all safety precautions.”Satish Rajaram Jadhav (65) and Sarita Satish Jadhav (61) resident of Ganesh Complex housing society, Bibwewadi areaSharing their experience without the domestic help, Satish Jadhav said, “In the month of February I had a minor operation of stomach and since then I am not able to move easily. After the lockdown one domestic help which we had in the house stopped coming to work. This ultimately brought workload on my wife and also on me, so she used to do all cooking part and other household work. I would help her in sweeping and small cleaning work. But as my stomach used to pain allot, I would not do much work.”Sarita Jadhav said, “Initially it was going fine with us, but after few days it started taking toll on both of us. We would get exhausted by doing household things, so we started let go some of the works. For outside work like getting grocery items, milk and other things we have now contacted the shop owners and their person drops the things to our doorstep.”Charminkumar Oza (67) and Prafullaben Oza (66) resident of Shukratara Society, Shukrawar peth“We are living with our son and had two domestic helps coming earlier for work, also there was a woman caretaker which used to come to stay with my wife during the day time. My wife has medical conditions and is undergoing treatment from few months now, she needs a walker to walk and so all the household work we were dependent on domestic helps . But due to the lockdown everything stopped suddenly and we were left with option to work on our own. So I daily do the cleaning and other small parts of daily work in the house, even our son helps sometimes but as he works in IT field he has his own priorities,” said Charminkumar Oza.“Apart from that for getting groceries and vegetables from outside I only go to the nearby shops. It certainly affects our health allot and keeping the energy in such situation is more important. If the domestic helps come back soon it will be a great relief for us.” he added.Housing societies talking about the issue“There actually is no ambiguity about the government notifications. The trepidation caused by corona, resulted in some MCs misinterpreting these directions either because of majority opinion or their personal prejudices resulting in banning domestic helps or making their employment near impossible by imposing various internal conditions. Pune’s middle and higher classes cannot do without domestic helps beyond a point for various reasons and compulsions of the city life. While townships and large complexes, overwhelmed by the daunting task of domestic helps verification, safety measures are at times in a fix but to contravene the government directions and cause inconvenience to needy residents, especially the seniors, is not correct.” said Dhairyashil Vandekar who is the resident and administrator of Fragrancia Society in Koregaon Park area.“Domestic helps were also banned by us till such time the government permitted them to work. We ensure strict compliance of all laid down government instructions with regard to their engagements. They are regularly apprised of the situation and consequences in case of an eventuality to ensure they do not compromise on the precautionary measures. A routine check on their family activities, cautioning and counselling on the do’s and don’ts is also done. While use of all types of devices for health check are useful it is always more safe in having an informed and aware domestic help,” he added.While Satosh Sabnis, chairman of the Suyog Nagar housing society located off Senapati Bapat road said, “After the lockdown was started we stopped domestic helps from coming to our society, but then there was demand from some of the senior citizens that they actually are in need of the domestic helps. So we made a list of residents in our society who are in need of domestic helps, then we also took details of each and every domestic help coming to our society. We got a list of containment zones from the police department and then we came to know that 90 per cent of domestic helps coming to our society were coming from the containment zones. Accordingly only 4 to 5 domestic helps were allowed to come for work that too with all the safety precautions, as residents also want help from domestic helps but not by compromising safety of their own and other residents in the society.”Doctors sayDr Prakash Rokade, medical officer at Aundh Civil Hospital said, “The main thing is to follow all the guidelines given by the government about taking safety precautions. Domestic helps are allowed to come for work to the housing societies but there are several rules and regulations given for that. If the domestic help is coming from the containment zone then she is not allowed, others can come but with having face mask, proper cleanliness, using hand sanitizers, not roaming around the society premises without any reason and other majors. We all should first remove fear about the disease, but at the same time needs to be alert and aware about taking precautions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/without-domestic-helps-senior-citizens-in-pune-struggle-to-manage-homes-as-housing-societies-follow-safety-rules/story-Jn2w233yw7O5oGyJ7pTvwM.html

12-06-2020||Pune||SPPU prepares exam schedule for final year students||The Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), along with its affiliated colleges, has begun preparations to conduct the exams for final-year students, based on a notification issued by the state government on May 8.The notification states that only final-year students will appear for the exams.Uddhav Thackeray, state chief minister, had earlier said that final-year students will be promoted based on their previous academic record, after which the state governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari had opposed the decision and said the universities’ chancellors will take the final call on the same.NS Umrani, pro-vice-chancellor, SPPU, said, “The preparations for the final-year exams are underway. We have not received any formal orders from the state government on promoting students or conducting exams. So we are preparing as per the schedule which we had received from the state government on May 8.”“If we get any new orders from the state government we will implement the same,” said Umrani.According to SPPU officials, the management council meeting was held earlier this week in which it was decided to carry out preparations for the exams as scheduled. A time-table has been prepared, the process of collecting data from colleges and redesigning the exam process has also been decided.Ravindrasinh Pardeshi, principal, Fergusson College, said, “Our primary preparations for conducting the exams in the college are complete, but we are now waiting for detailed guidelines from SPPU.”“We are yet to get clarity on the duration of the exam and seating arrangements from SPPU. Once we get the clarity on it, the actual process of preparations will start within the college,” said Pardeshi.Sagar More, a student from Arts stream, said, “I am pursuing a degree at SPPU, but currently I am in my village in Kolhapur. We have not received any communication from the university about the exams.”“If we get the exam time-table we can start preparations accordingly,” he added.Ruksana Patil Shaikh, a student of Women’s Studies Centre, SPPU, said, “Exams are important for students, but safety is equally important. Whatever decision is taken about the exams the safety of the students should be the top priority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/sppu-prepares-exam-schedule-for-final-year-students/story-vP9uT9xKqaGWn10r4rkNpL.html
12-06-2020||Lucknow||UP govt employs 300 workers under MNREGS on river restoration project||The Uttar Pradesh government has begun work to restore the Kalyani river in the Barabanki district with the aim to provide employment to around 300 people including migrant workers during the Covid-19 lockdown.The work, to be covered under the MNREG scheme, is being done on a 2.6 kilometre stretch in the Mavaiya area of Barabanki in an attempt to restore the river that is turning into a ‘nullah’.Deputy commissioner, MNREGA-Barabanki, ND Dwivedi said, “Yes, we have begun work on a stretch of 2.6 km from Mavaiya to Holi Purwa in Barabanki for restoration of the Kalyan river. A budget of about Rs 59 lakh has been earmarked under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) for the river restoration project. We propose to create work for about 30,000 mandays by making the river 1.5 metre deep and 25 metre wide. We hope to complete the work on the present stretch by June 30.”The source of the 170 km long river is Dhannag lake, a pilgrimage centre on the Barabanki-Sitapur border. Authorities hope the restoration work will help in ensuring smooth flow of the river which ultimately merges with the Gomti river in Ayodhya.The restoration work on the river will likely continue in other parts of the state as well, creating more jobs including for migrant workers. “This is a small stretch of the river. If the work being carried out under MNREGA is found satisfactory, more such stretches will be undertaken to restore the river all along its course,” said a district functionary associated with the MNREGS.A campaign demanding restoration of the Kalyani was launched in 2013. But it drew the attention of district administration only recently.“The Kalyani loses all signs of being a river right from the Dhannag lake (a large part of which is in Sitapur), the point of its origin where a fair is also organised on Kartik Purnima every year. A dried up stretch of about two kilometres is the only sign of the river’s origin from the lake. About a 30 km stretch of the river from Khujji to Nigoha is being illegally used for farming. Later, water seepage from the Sharada canal reaches the Kalyani and it takes the shape of a river in some parts,” said Ram Lakhan Shukla, convenor of the Save River Campaign launched in 2013.“The district administration’s decision to launch the restoration drive is a welcome move and will ensure flow of water in the river,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-employs-300-workers-under-mnregs-on-river-restoration-project/story-qZ1QYWr0a2b0LBDltQO0BL.html

12-06-2020||Chandigarh||Tribals in Spiti valley opt for self-governance in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic||In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, residents of Spiti in Himachal’s Lahaul-Spiti district have imposed self-governance and are following their own set of guidelines to ensure the valley remains corona-free. On June 9, villagers in Spiti valley did not allow local legislator and agriculture minister Ram Lal Markanda from entering the valley. While the minister termed the protest against him ‘politically motivated’, locals say Markanda was denied entry in a bid to protect the valley and its people from the deadly contagion, as the valley lacks adequate health services. JOINT COMMITTEE FORMED While the Centre only imposed the lockdown on March 24, Spiti valley had begun formulating strategies, raising awareness and holding discussions about the novel coronavirus in February 2020. On March 17, locals formed a ‘committee for preventive measures and sustainable development’ (CPMSD) comprising yuva mandals, mahila mandals, local panchayats, gram sabhas, social action groups and lamas from five monasteries.The committee decided to shut all hotels, dhabas, and transport services in the area before the national lockdown was imposed.The entry of non-locals was barred and a 15-day quarantine period was made mandatory for people of the valley coming from outside. The entrance to the valley is guarded by locals and the committee issued guidelines regarding arrangements to be made for home quarantine. The locals also monitored the arrival essentials such as LPG, diesel, petrol, fuel wood, and vegetables from outside the district. “As we are located in a remote and cold desert area, which is also a tourist hotspot, we realised we were vulnerable to the disease,” said a local, requesting anonymity. COMMERCIAL FARMING PUT ON HIATUS“We banned labour from outside and farmers decided to grow traditional crops instead of commercial crops even if it translated into losses,” said CMPSD member Lhmo Buitith.The locals have also urged the government to stop HRTC bus services from plying in the area.“CMPSD has ensured that all rules and guidelines are applicable to all people without any bias or discrimination,” said Buitith. “It is difficult to maintain physical distance due to heavy dependence on community due to shared lifestyle and livelihood practices in the tribal area,” Buitith said.“Separating elders and children was difficult as in most families three or four generations live together,” said Buitith. SPECIAL STATUS IN CONSTITUTIONScheduled areas and tribes have been given special status in the constitution of India. The 73rd constitutional amendment and provisions of different acts confer powers on the local communities through gram sabhas to take decisions to protect its area, resources, livelihoods and cultural and social existence.“At the time of such an unprecedented crisis, it is not just necessary for us to take steps to ensure our safety but also completely legitimate. Public health experts and the government’s ICMR Task Force has clearly said that the policy of lockdown should not be ‘one size fits all’, but rather be implemented according to local context,” said CMPSD member Lhmo Buitith.“The people of Spiti, to secure and protect their existence, have decided to postpone their regular means of income such tourism and commercial farming for a whole year as such it is the moral duty of the government and its representatives to cooperate with the locals,” Buitith said. The tribal community, which has a population of 13,000 spread across 30 villages, has also been concerned about protecting its existence, ethnic and cultural heritage, which has evolved over the years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/tribals-in-spiti-valley-opt-for-self-governance-in-the-wake-of-covid-19-pandemic/story-ZdtaTt0XHrqc6MP5dXQJTO.html

12-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, alumnus and soil scientist wins prestigious World Food Prize||Indian-American soil scientist Dr Rattan Lal, an alumnus of Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, has won the prestigious World Food Prize, considered to be equivalent to a Nobel Prize in agriculture, in recognition of his contribution to increase the global food supply by helping small farmers improve their soil’s health.Dr Lal, 75, in his career spanning more than five decades and four continents, has promoted innovative soil-saving techniques benefiting the livelihoods of more than 500 million small farmers, improving the food and nutritional security of more than two billion people and saving hundreds of millions of hectares of natural tropical ecosystems, the World Food Prize Foundation said in a statement on Thursday.“Dr Rattan Lal, a native of Punjab and a citizen of the United States, will receive the 2020 World Food Prize for developing and mainstreaming a soil-centric approach to increasing food production that restores and conserves natural resources and mitigates climate change,” the Iowa-based foundation said.“Soil science has been recognised by this award. I feel very happy about it,” he told PTI in an interview after the announcement.The award is especially important because the first recipient of this prestigious award in 1987 was Indian agricultural scientist Dr MS Swaminathan, the father of India’s Green Revolution, Dr Lal said.RESTORING AND MANAGING SOIL HEALTHIn a country like India, he said, soil is prone to degradation because of harsh climate and other factors.“So this award to a soil scientist highlights the importance of restoring and managing soil health. We need to give more attention to Dharti Mata (mother earth). Our shastras and puranas also indicated that we must pay respect to Dharti Mata. So this award means a lot to me,” Dr Lal said.“Every year, we are astounded by the quality of nominations for the prize, but Dr Lal’s stellar work on management and conservation of agriculture’s most cherished natural resource, the soil, set him apart,” said Gebisa Ejeta, chair of the World Food Prize Selection Committee and 2009 recipient of the award.Dr Lal is a distinguished professor in the College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences (CFAES) at the Ohio State University.PAU ALUMNI ASSOCIATION CONGRATULATES DR LALThe Alumni Association of Punjab Agricultural University, on behalf of vice-chancellor BS Dhillon, faculty, staff and students of the university, congratulated Dr Rattan Lal for the prestigious award bestowed upon him. “The association feels proud of him for bringing laurels to his alma mater and wishes Dr Lal many more years of service to humanity,” professor and dean Surinder S Kukal said in a release.Over the past five decades, Dr Lal has reduced hunger by pioneering agricultural methods across the globe that not only restore degraded soil but also reduce global warming, the university said in a statement.“It is a privilege and honour to be of service to the many small farmers from around the world because I was one of them. They are stewards of the land. They are the ones with the tremendous challenge of feeding the world,” said Dr Lal, who is the founding director of the Carbon Management and Sequestration Center in Ohio.He said that he would donate the award money of USD 250,000 (Rs 1.9 crore) for the future soil research and education.STOP CROP RESIDUE BURNING IN PUNJAB, HARYANADr Lal said that his soil organic matter content in the surface layer should from 2-3%. But soil in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi, central India and southern parts contain maybe 0.5% or maybe 0.2%.“They are severely depleted, degraded. Consequently, not only is the productivity and yields low but the efficiency of inputs such as fertiliser and irrigation are also low. When crops are grown on unhealthy soil, the quality of the food and nutritional quality is also poor.“When the health of soil is degraded, the health of people is also degraded. I think it’s important for India and other developing countries to pay attention to restoring the health of the soil,” Dr Lal said.The soil scientist called for the immediate stopping of burning of crop residue in states such as Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.“Taking everything away from land is not good for land. There is a law of return. Whatever you take from the earth, you must return it,” he said.SOIL PROTECTION POLICY NEEDEDBrick-making, which is fast depleting soil, is another concern for Dr Lal.“India should have a soil protection policy,” he said, adding that a certain part of agricultural land cannot be taken out for brick making.He also called for rewarding farmers who help in protecting the soil by not burning crops, more use of compost and manure.“Soil protection policy is important. We should have a soil health assessment report every five years at the national level. How is soil changing and we should protect agricultural land against other usage patterns such as urbanisation, brick making,” he said, adding that fertiliser is not a good substitute for crop management.Stating that the crop yields in India are about half of that in China and even lesser than that of the United States, Dr Lal noted that there appears to be no reason for that. “We should have crop yield as good as any country. The health of our soil is poor. We have given a lot of emphasis on varieties. Varieties are important. (But) One cannot do anything if the soil is poor. That is a part which we must recognise.“I think Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi can do a lot towards improving soil health and (launch a) movement. Modi can also indicate how our religious books preach this. It is a part of our culture,” he added.(With input from HT, Ludhiana)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-agricultural-university-ludhiana-alumnus-and-soil-scientist-wins-prestigious-world-food-prize/story-J5nmdUEt21vXbwtSD4JSoI.html

According to officials, a detailed project report for the rope-way system is being prepared with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation for Dehradun city. The state government also approved the project for the construction of Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) in Haridwar city along with the construction of Metro Light in Haridwar-Rishikesh and Nepali Farm-Vidhan Sabha Corridor.Jitendra Tyagi, managing director of Uttarakhand Metro Rail gave a detailed presentation on Dehradun, Haridwar, Rishikesh MetroLite System during which he shared information about the route plan study for the metro project from Haridwar to Rishikesh, Dehradun to Nepali Farm.In December last year, Uttarakhand had signed a contract with DMRC for the ropeway projects. A first instalment of Rs 43.30 lakh was also given to DMRC at that time.State urban development minister Madan Kaushik , who had signed the contract, had said that once completed, the ropeway system will ease the traffic problems in Dehradun.“Till date, the ropeway system is not being used as a mode of mass transport at any other place in India. Dehradun will be the first city to adopt this system,” said Kaushik.Two routes have been proposed for Dehradun city – the first from Forest Research Institute till Rispana Bridge via Clock Tower and the second one from ISBT till Madhuban Hotel via Clock Tower. The ropeway will have a carrying capacity of around ten passengers.In Haridwar, Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) or pod-taxis will be started and for Rishikesh light metro transit will be established for connecting Dehradun and Haridwar. The projects will cover around 20 to 25 km and likely to cost up to Rs 2200 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-approves-comprehensive-mobility-plan-for-3-cities-including-dehradun/story-qVdTtPWLrX8sYzgvNFJ5jP.html

12-06-2020||Bhopal||Recite Hanuman Chalisa 11 times: MP Congress leader’s remedy to keep Covid-19 away||A senior Congress leader from Madhya Pradesh has suggested reciting the Hanuman Chalisa will protect people from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has affected more than 2.86 lakh people and killed over 8,000 in the country.Ramesh Saxena, who was a member of the legislative assembly (MLA) for four terms from 1993 to 2008, made the comments while speaking to reporters in Sehore on Thursday.“I can say it with authority that if members of any family sit together to recite the Hanuman Chalisa 11 times, which will take hardly half an hour, corona can’t touch them,” Saxena said.Saxena, who won assembly elections once as an Independent candidate and three times on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ticket and joined the Congress in January last year, also offered an explanation.“There is a line in Hanuman Chalisa - Nase rog hare sab peera, japat nirantar Hanuman veera (Constant recital of name of Lord Hanuman cures all diseases and pain). We should trust it. Trust gives us the result,” he said.Before this, Saxena had similar advice to stop crops from being damaged during rains and hailstorm in 2018. He had asked people to recite the Hanuman Chalisa at least 500 times every day.“We all have a strong belief in the God and we all do prayers but such suggestions will only lead to confusion in public when we all are fighting Covid-19,” Dr KL Sahu, the former director of the health department, said.BJP was quick to react to the ex-MLA’s suggestion.“Recital of holy texts and our faith in God give a boost to our morale and thus immunity power to deal with any crisis but it doesn’t mean that any Covid patient can be cured with the recital of any text only,” Rajneesh Agrawal, the spokesperson of the BJP’s state unit, said.“When we are in public life we should not make any such statement that any person believes it blindly and avoids a medical treatment,” Agrawal added.The Congress, however, distanced itself from Saxena’s remedy and said it was not the party’s stand. “I am also a devotee of Lord Hanuman but religion and spirituality give us the strength to face and overcome any crisis in life,” Bhupendra Gupta, the Congress spokesperson, said.“However, when our PM exhorts people to ring bells and blow conches and the health minister in Madhya Pradesh says it’s not allopathy or homoeopathy but it’s sympathy that cures a Covid patient, there are aberrations like such a statement that came from the Congress leader,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/recite-hanuman-chalisa-11-times-mp-congress-leader-s-remedy-to-keep-covid-19-away/story-TGRzYvdITgnPm8ZCzeZfbM.html

Many say that amid the long wait for bookings in trains, most of which are running to full capacity, they are left to their own devices to travel back home.A 23-year-old resident of Patiala, who was stuck in Delhi since the lockdown was imposed, said as she didn’t get train reservation, she boarded a bus from Panipat to Ambala, hoping to catch a bus to take her home. “The station manager of this bus stand told me I can board a bus to Punjab from here, but when I arrived here, I found there are no buses. Now, my brother is coming from Patiala in his car to pick me up,” she said. A few labourers sitting next to her say that they have been waiting to take a bus to Gurugram, from where they hope to travel to Bihar but to no avail. “There are no seats available on trains till June 23. Now, we are waiting for a bus to take us to Gurugram. We will only get an offline ticket if it doesn’t get full online,” they said. At least 17 buses operate from the Ambala depot everyday but most carry very few passengers, less than the prescribed limit of 30.Ambala cantonment bus stand station manager Vijender Singh said, “Around 7 to 8 buses leave for nearby districts from here every day, which carry around a dozen passengers. Except those headed to Panchkula, Delhi or Gurugram, most buses run below capacity. Sometimes, a bus waits for over two hours and has to depart only with a couple of passengers.”“I don’t think the services will improve until there are regular buses for Delhi or Punjab. There are several passengers for Delhi who wait here for hours but there are no buses for Delhi, so they board a bus to Gurugram and travel further,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-direct-buses-to-delhi-or-punjab-passengers-in-ambala-a-hassled-lot/story-yXO6kJRxOcIJAcCdpsluIN.html

12-06-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Old landmark in a new normal||The battle hasn’t been won, the war hasn’t ended yet. Nevertheless, we are picking up the strands of our disrupted life in the wake of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.It is in this spirit that one ought to commemorate the reopening of a special landmark—a shop that serves one of the most delicious jalebis in the entire National Capital Region.Sardar Jalebi in Gurugram’s Sadar Bazar started producing jalebis again a few days back, shortly after the easing of the prolonged lockdown triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. The viral attack is only intensifying further but the city is trying to limp back to business and you see glimpses of the old normality in this much-loved icon.This late morning, a couple of cooks, whom the owner calls karigars, are deep-frying the jalebis in huge cauldrons. One gentleman is squeezing the batter through a thin cloth into the oil-filled vessel, constantly moving his hand anti-clockwise to get twirly-shapes befitting a jalebi. Another man is filling a fresh stock of jalebis into a paper bag for a customer.This Sadar Bazar’s signature jalebi is thin and extremely crisp and tastes excellent even when cold—unlike its thicker counterpart in the equally illustrious Old Famous Jalebi Wala in Old Delhi’s Chandni Chowk, which tastes best when eaten hot, just off the karahi. (That shop too has reopened, serving from 9am to 6pm daily).Each worker here at Sardar Jalebi is attired in gloves and mask, and no mask is slipping down under the nose as it is frustratingly the case with most people walking on the streets these days.All this is being viewed through a mobile screen that connects this reporter to Gurpreet Singh, whose family has been running this establishment for 70 years. Wearing a similar black mask as his staffers, the turbaned young man is chatting on WhatsApp video. He is sitting against a wall decked up with the portraits of all the 10 Sikh gurus. The portrait of Guru Nanak is decked with a garland of fresh marigolds.“We have five karigars at the moment,” says Mr Singh, his voice a bit muffled, perhaps because of the mask. All the employees in the shop have their families living in their native districts in either UP or Bihar, Mr Singh informs. But unlike many other migrants, they didn’t rush back to their villages following the closure of all business during the lockdown. “We looked after all of them,” informs Mr Singh. “They live on the floor above the shop and we made sure (during the lockdown days) to keep them supplied with enough food rations, and that they had enough money to send some of it to their families every month as they always have.”Some of the staffers at Sardar Jalebi have been working here for decades. Bhagwan Das has been here for 40 years. Chhedi Ram has been making jalebis for 32 years. (The rest of the men at work are Raju, Manoj and Arun).There has to be said something of the relationship that this small family-run business has developed with its karigars over the years. Maybe, this aspect explains the fact that, while so many other celebrity eateries in the Delhi region have lost that something special that made their signature dish so well-loved, the jalebis here continue to be universally admired without any ifs and buts. Indeed, it might be difficult to find a longtime patron complaining of a decline in Sardar’s standards.Despite its long life and reputation, the establishment itself is extremely modest. There are only a few benches to sit. Frankly speaking, this in not a place to lounge about. You get your jalebis and take it away to have it elsewhere.And yet, some of the afternoon scenes back in the BC (Before Corona) era used to be extraordinarily tender. Particularly after classes were over, when students of a government school nearby would excitedly come to receive their daily share of one jalebi each—for free!The Sardar Jalebi got its name from its Sikh founder, Arjun Singh, who moved as a Partition refugee from what is now Pakistan to what was then Gurgaon. “He passed away in 1994… he was my dadaji,” says Mr Singh. With his father passing away some years ago, he manages the business with his tauji (uncle), Jagmohan Singh.While there is no doubt that the shop must have suffered a serious setback due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown, like many other businesses in this bazaar, one must not forget that this particular landmark has seen worse. During the killings of Sikhs, after prime minister India Gandhi’s assassination in 1984, the Sardar Jalebi remained shut for at least three months—says Mr Singh, who, in fact, was born in that fateful year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-old-landmark-in-a-new-normal/story-3SyHLoFIXZD4APDy01SaZJ.html

12-06-2020||Chandigarh||No Sunday mass in Chandigarh churches till June 30||Even though places of worship in Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali reopened from June 8, church authorities, keeping in mind the Covid-19 outbreak, will stream Sunday mass and other prayer services on YouTube, Facebook live and WhatsApp till June 30 to prevent community gathering.The churches, however, will remain open for individuals and families to come in and pray. Tricity Churches Association have decided to stream Sunday mass and other prayer services online till July 30 though the administration had issued guidelines to repeat Sunday mass on weekdays for those who could not attend it because of social distancing. Use of liturgical booklets and hymnals are prohibited, with the directions that the Holy Communion will be received “strictly by hand or other alternatives prescribed by the bishop for the time being.”“Since Covid-19 cases are on the rise, we cannot risk holding prayers as ours is community prayer till June 30,” Ignatius Mascarenhas, the Bishop of Simla Chandigarh Diocese, said on Thursday.He added that the situation would be assessed later and a call taken on the reopening of the church after June 30. But, “All our catholic churches will remain open and if any individual wants to pray, (he or she) can come with their family and do it,” he said.Only Eucharist services (in which bread and wine are consecrated and consumed in remembrance of Jesus’s death or Communion) are allowed in the interim period and others such as novena prayers, baptism, first communion, marriage and others are prohibited.The parish priest is responsible for implementing safety measures to prevent Covid-19 transmission.“The guidelines of the government regarding prayers do not suit us and we have decided to postpone the reopening of churches till June 30,” said Lawrence Malik, adviser, Tricity Churches Association. “ I urge the Christian community to set up a sacred space at home for worship, which will help people stay at home during the pandemic and engage with the divine with devotion,” he added.Rev Brian Anderson, pastor, Light of the World Church, Zirakpur, said, “We will continue offering prayers through Facebook Live and YouTube. We are also using the Zoom app to talk to people and pray for them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-sunday-mass-in-chandigarh-churches-till-june-30/story-0Ec05EUGawV7XNwiov7TPK.html

Chandigarh reported its first death linked to the virus on May 3 when an 82-year-old woman of Sector 18, who was undergoing treatment at a hospital in Panchkula, died.On May 8, the second fatality was reported after a man from Hallomajra tested positive for Covid-19, two days after his death at Government Multi-Speciality Hospital, Sector 16.On May 9, a 62-year-old man of Bapu Dham Colony tested positive posthumously at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32.A three-day-old girl became the fourth fatality linked to the virus.

She was found to be Covid positive the next day. Her parents, who are from Dadumajra, had tested negative.The last fatality from the city was an 80-year-old woman from the containment zone of Sector 30, who was declared brought dead at GMSH-16 and had tested positive on June 2.In the last week, there has been a spike in cases coming from outside the Bapu Dham containment zone. “Opening of inter-state buses, trains, cars, planes remains a major challenge in restricting new cases. But our policy and timely decisions have successfully kept the figures low and within manageable limits,” said Parida.When asked whether UT will initiate random testing in the city, Parida said that the administration continued to follow the testing protocols set by Indian Council Medical Research (ICMR). “There is no community transmission of the disease in the city, and ICMR testing protocol is being strictly followed.

In 2019-20, the civic body had projected a ₹150 crore revenue, but received only ₹125 crore.What’s more, no funds have been allocated for the maintenance of parks or solid waste management, Swachh Bharat Mission, sewerage maintenance and sewerage augmentation project.The MC had been passing a deficit budget from the last four years, but in its last stint came up with a ₹17 crore surplus budget.In February this year, the civic body had shown ₹251.66 crore expenditure in the proposed budget, but the local bodies department approved only ₹92.26 crore. Even though the MC will remain in surplus of ₹35.6 crore against the earlier proposed ₹17 crore after the budget is approved, the MC officials said that it couldn’t compensate for a cut of ₹141 crore.Already during the nationwide lockdown, the MC has suffered a loss of ₹13 crore.A senior MC official requesting anonymity said, “We are passing through financial straits. Though we had proposed ₹100 crore for maintenance of parks, Swachh Bharat mission, water supply and sewerage maintenance and for solid waste management projects, not a single penny has been approved. We are totally clueless on how to tackle the situation. We will take up the issue with the local government.”The MC is now eying ₹66 crore from the Punjab municipal funds, ₹28 crore from property tax, and ₹11 crore from advertisements as the major income sources in the ₹127.86 crore surplus budget.The five-year term of the present office of the MC got over on April 26, and subsequently, powers had been vested with MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg.Every month, the civic body spends ₹5 crore on paying salaries, power bills, fuel charges, to private agencies and maintaining cleanliness in the city.Former deputy mayor Manjit Singh Sethi said, “The government has completely failed on all fronts. More than 200 tenders of development works worth ₹30 crore have not been allotted in the last eight months. If they are not allotted soon, we will hold a massive protest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/another-blow-to-fund-starved-mohali-mc-as-141-crore-cut-imposed-in-budget/story-SN7x722ibAJkTTI7Xe0eFM.html

12-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi sees big spike on day Covid-19 death count hits 1,000||The death toll in Delhi due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) soared past the 1,000 mark on Thursday as the city recorded 1,877 new infections and 101 new fatalities, a new record for single-day numbers that reinforce fears about the outbreak worsening and the need to rapidly ramp up health care infrastructure. According to the Delhi government’s daily health bulletin that accounts for cases and deaths from the day before, the Capital’s total tally of Covid-19 cases stands at 34,687 and of these, 1,085 have died. The latest figures push the city’s case fatality rate – the proportion of infected persons who succumb to the illness – to 3.13%, the highest it has been since March 25, when a single death had taken place from among 35 infections.“We are planning to double the number of beds needed; there will be around 15,000 beds in another 10 days or so. This is the biggest disaster of the century,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in a virtual press conference on Thursday.The 1,877 new cases came from testing 5,360 samples, translating to a test confirmation rate of over 35%. This number has steadily grown from about 21% at the beginning of June, a trend that experts say could indicate the outbreak is larger than detected, particularly due to the limited reach of testing, although the inherent bias in testing of largely symptomatic cases may also have something to do with this. According to the health bulletin, the number of active infections is 20,871, of which nearly 78% are in home isolation that is available as a treatment option for those with mild or asymptomatic illness. The current rate at which infections double in the city -- taken as a trajectory seen over the last week -- is 14.8 days. “The lockdown has been lifted, people are moving around and interacting with each other. The number of cases will go up. That is the natural course of the disease,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. Officials in the administration have been divided over whether the rise in cases justifies the reimposing of the lockdown. “A lockdown would help but now that it has been lifted, we cannot ask them not to. They are not wearing masks and going to markets which will lead to increase in the number of cases. As it is, it has become difficult to trace contacts,” said a senior district-level health official, asking not to be named. A senior health department official clarified on condition of anonymity that “Delhi is not considering another lockdown for now. “If we impose lockdown again, there will be no logic as the cases will increase from around 2.5 lakh to 25 lakh despite the lockdown,” Jain had said in a statement on Wednesday.Delhi, as well as most parts of the country, began what has been called Unlock 1.0 this week, allowing malls, salons and religious places to open in addition to several other types of activity that were approved last month. Officials at the Union and the state level said it is now crucial to learn to live with the virus, a process that will involve new etiquettes such as always wearing a mask when away from home and keeping a distance of 2 metre from others.“We went into a lockdown a little early and even the relaxation of restrictions happened a little early. Other countries lifted their lockdown when their curve started to come down, but we did it when the curve is going up exponentially. However, economic considerations have to be kept in mind. The only strategy that the government can now adopt is aggressively test and isolate those with the infection or close areas where they think the infection is circulating in the community,” said Amit Singh, associate professor at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. The spike in cases comes in a week when the government begun preparations to add over a 100,000 beds, an exercise described as “an unprecedented challenge” by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, after initially attempting to restrict access to its facilities only to people who live in the national capital. On Wednesday, the CM said Delhi would need 65,000 beds by mid-July and 150,000 by the end of the month. On the basis of the current doubling rate of 12.6 days, the Delhi health department has projected that the number of active cases in Delhi will touch 60,004 by June 30; 134,722 by July 15 and 319,237 by July 31. According to documents reviewed by HT and comments by officials aware of the preparations, the administration has earmarked space for close to 25,000 hospital beds in banquet halls, a religious centre and two stadiums in the city. Officials are going over the experiences of their counterparts in Mumbai, where the civic agency converted some of the city’s most prominent sport complexes into health care facilities. “Our challenge will be bigger because we are turning all these spaces into makeshift hospitals while theirs were observation centres and Covid care centres,” said a senior government official, who was aware of discussions at a late-night meeting chaired by health minister Satyender Jain on Wednesday. Mumbai crossed the 1,000 deaths mark on May 26, when it had close to 32,000 cases – a scenario similar to what Delhi is staring at now. The Maharashtra capital then had a doubling rate of 13.1 days but has not brought it down to 24.6 days.Wednesday’s discussions in Delhi were described as the first round of scouting for space. It included a covered space that belongs to a religious group in Bhati area, where 10,000 hospitals beds can be accommodated. The exercise will require a mammoth logistical mobilization comprising medical and paramedical staff, crucial medical equipment such as oxygen cylinders and general infrastructure resources such as beds and electricity connections.Authorities in central China’s Wuhan, where the coronavirus is believed to have first emerged last year, built a 1,000-bed hospital in 12 days at the peak of the outbreak in February. It was among 16 makeshift hospitals the city built, the last of which were closed by mid-March after the region controlled the outbreak.(With inputs from Sweta Goswami)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/capital-sees-big-spike-on-day-covid-19-death-count-hits-1-000/story-XdcjxVrdXUuzlZwfJQN8bP.html

ONGC had re-commenced rotating shifts for on-shore to offshore deployments this month. The workers displayed symptoms on the rigs and were flown to Mumbai, where they were tested positive. ONGC did not respond to HT’s queries. ONGC workers usually work in 14-day shifts on rotational basis. “ONGC had not rotated workers for around five weeks to nullify the risk of spreading the virus in Bombay High, an offshore oil field. However, it was only after the lockdown restrictions were lifted did ONGC arrange for charter flights for their workers to reach Mumbai, so that the workers stranded offshore could be given rest,” said a senior Juhu airport official.Sources privy to the development said that all workers were taken to rigs only after they were rechecked for symptoms just before taking off. A top helicopter company official, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Even though the pilots flying suspected people are provided hazmath suits, ONGC might start conducting swab tests even for the pilots flying the workers who tested positive after being brought back to land.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/10-ongc-workers-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-mumbai/story-oys18EAHDZtKGyJgJZUiKO.html

The institute has now made special arrangements to accommodate aspirants with limited internet resources, especially in the wake of the lockdown and the ban on inter-state travel, owing to the Covid-19 outbreak.“To make sure that all candidates have a fair chance in the interview process, we have made a few special arrangements. All selected candidates have to first register with us and then we allot them a schedule for the personal interview,” said P Shajahan, dean, academics.A dedicated team of telecallers will then get in touch with candidates via call to check with them about the availability of the internet.“If candidates don’t have access to the internet, we ask them to move to a location where they can get access to a computer or phone with internet connection. If they face issues with mobility, we try to help them get a pass for their travel to the institute,” said Shajahan.Candidates are also given the option to reschedule their interview if they cannot get online, he added. So far over 4,600 have completed their registrations and their interviews are ongoing.Around 5,300 candidates had cleared the written tests held in January and are due for a personal interview for admissions to the Masters programmes. However, in view of the lockdown, the institute had deferred the admission process but began online personal interviews in the first week of June but cancelled the pre-interview tests.Several student bodies of the institute, such as the Progressive Students’ Forum, had demanded that the institute’s administration make the online process accessible to all applicants.

12-06-2020||Chandigarh||Gurugram among four emerging districts of concern in country||With 1,858 active Covid-19 cases, Gurugram has become one of the four “emerging districts of concern” in the country, as per a central government analysis. This was conveyed to the state government by a team of central officials, led by Union cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba, during a video meeting on Thursday.“Gurugram has been bracketed with Udupi and Yadgir in Karnataka and Kolhapur in Maharashtra for having more than 400 coronavirus cases of which 90% were detected after May 18 lockdown relaxations. It is also one of the top 14 districts in the country that contribute to more than 60% of the total active caseload,” said an official. The district, which is part of the national capital region (NCR), accounts for more than 50% of the total active cases in Haryana. On Thursday, Gurugram recorded 191 fresh Covid-19 positive cases, taking its tally of active cases to 1,858. The cumulative number of positive cases in Gurugram is 2,737 which is more than 45% of the cumulative cases in the entire state. ‘ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE CRUCIAL’ The Union health ministry officials said that containment of the infection in such districts, strict perimeter control was crucial and active house-to-house surveillance through special teams was critical for early identification of cases.In these highly affected districts, emphasis should also be on community surveillance, the central officials said.The central officials said that in high-case load districts, additional testing and strict containment measures were needed and there was a need to focus on early testing of high-risk contacts and clinical triaging at facilities. Haryana officials were also told to ensure sufficient hospital capacity and sufficient logistics, including human resources, through advance planning for next two months. It was also emphasised that institutional quarantine was increasingly critical to reduce load on the health system and there was a need to ramp up institutional capacity (hotels, stadiums).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gurugram-among-4-emerging-districts-of-concern-in-country/story-cGNJfzw4iFPE77Ize5s8hI.html

Tope said that action has been initiated against the dean of the medical college and other officials concerned.“I admit that the Jalgaon incident is true. We took strict cognisance of the negligence and suspended the dean, superintendent, professor and nursing staff of the hospital based on an initial report. We will ensure that no such cases take place henceforth in Maharashtra,” Tope said.State home minister Anil Deshmukh too said that stern action has been taken in the Jalgaon incident.Speaking to ANI, Deshmukh said, “We have taken a serious note of the Jalgaon incident. A few have already been booked for this criminal offence, while stern action is being taken against those responsible for the inhuman act. An inquiry is ongoing.”Earlier, two cases of missing patients have been reported from hospitals in Sion and Kandivli, even as Maharashtra has over 97,000 cases – the highest number in the country.The health minister said that a security guard of Kandivli’s Shatabdi Hospital has been suspended after an 80-year patient left the Covid-19 facility and was later found dead near the railway tracks a few kilometres away.“There have been two incidents – one in Sion and the other at Kandivli. In the latter, when the patient had left his bed, the staff thought he had been to the toilet. But the man left the hospital and was absconding,” Tope said.A repeat of such incidents has raised questions over the efficacy of the state’s health care machinery to deal with the rising number of Covid-19.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is in the Opposition in the state, has slammed the Maharashtra government and its agencies for the negligence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/jalgaon-patient-s-body-found-in-hospital-s-toilet-maharashtra-health-minister-admits-to-lapses/story-kStrf8rssajSqa0tmGqy3J.html

Their activities include business links with groups in India such as Sahara, as well as philanthropic and education-related activities in the UK and elsewhere.Calling the donation a ‘transformational gift’, the university said on Thursday that the college’s initial research themes are: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning; Environmental Change; and Cellular Life, which includes work in understanding Covid-19.The Reubens’ gift expands the Reuben Scholarship Programme, which was established in 2012 for disadvantaged undergraduate students, the university said, adding that the college is preparing to recruit its first cohort of graduate students in September.Louise Richardson, Oxford vice-chancellor, said: “Thanks to the extraordinary generosity of the Reuben family, Reuben College will join the storied ranks of Oxford Colleges. For generations to come, the lives of young people will be transformed as they learn to engage in research that pushes at the frontiers of knowledge”.The college is located in a suite of buildings on the Radcliffe Science Library site. The buildings are currently undergoing refurbishment to create a central site for students. Some of the space will be shared with the library and the university’s museums.A university release quoted the Reuben family as saying: “We hope that this endowment for the Reuben College will help keep Oxford University at the global forefront of research in the vital areas of Environmental Change, AI and Machine Learning and Cellular Life, thereby helping to improve the lives of millions of people long into the future.”According to college president Lionel Tarassenko, it was launched last year with a focus on the three themes of artificial intelligence, environmental change and cellular life. The donation will now enable it to envisage a future that includes more cross-cutting research themes and offer richer engagement opportunities for academics, graduate students and the community, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-born-reuben-brothers-donate-80mn-to-oxford-varsity-college/story-rVDn3fMnOSmSEADDVecODP.html

The man’s 25-year-old son said he has tried to find out about his father’s condition from hospital authorities and Ambernath Municipal Corporation (AMC), but neither has responded to his queries.“The day he was admitted to Thane Civil Hospital, I spoke to him on his mobile phone. But the next day, his number could not be reached. I called the hospital on their landline number, but it isn’t working. I can’t even visit the hospital, as it is risky and the authorities have denied permission. At least the civic body should inform the family about the patient’s condition. We are worried as his condition was critical on the day he had been taken to the hospital,” the son said.The family lives at Shiv Nagar locality in Ambernath. The man works in a salon in Ambernath, while his son works with a private company.AMC said the patient has been responding to treatment and his family need not worry about his condition. “We had informed the family that he had been admitted to Thane Civil Hospital. The hospital is now supposed to communicate with the patient’s family. But as per our knowledge, the patient is doing well,” said N Rathod, AMC’s nodal officer.Thane Civil Hospital said they inform the patient’s family only when there is any “major change in the patient’s condition”. “Only if there is a development in the patient’s condition, do we inform the family. For instance, a patient’s family is contacted during the time of discharge or if the patient is critical.

The accused robbed the machine filled with ₹17.9 lakh cash on Monday and carried it in a tempo. All four accused have been remanded in police custody for eight days.The incident took place between 2am and 3am in Mori village of Shil Daighar, said police officers, adding the ATM had no security guards. The group had initially tried to break open the machine, but when they failed to do so, they took the entire machine with them in the four-wheeler.The arrested accused are Atul Davane, 22, a mason from Turbhe; Suraj Mhatre, 29, rickshaw driver from Ambernath; Suraj Kamble, 24, a security guard from Belapur; and Phulaji Gaykar, 36, a Xerox shop owner from Ambernath. “The four accused were questioned on Tuesday. The main accused in this case is Bhim Nepali, a resident of Nepal. Based on a tip off that he has left for Uttar Pradesh in a bus, we informed the UP police who laid a trap and caught him. A team has left for Uttar Pradesh to get the accused here,” said Sandeep Bagul, assistant police inspector. Bagul said while the ATM machine has been recovered, they are yet to seize the stolen cash, and suspect it is with Nepali.

12-06-2020||Mumbai||Woman has primary claim on children: HC||The Bombay high court (HC) observed that a woman in a live-in relationship has an indefeasible claim of natural guardianship of the children born from said relationship, and on Tuesday rejected the plea of a Pune resident seeking custody of his minor son born out of a romantic relationship with a woman from New Zealand.The 26-year-old, who has a son with his ex-wife, said he met the New Zealand citizen in 2008. Three years later the couple began a romantic relationship that lasted till June 2012, by which point the woman was pregnant. She gave birth to a boy about six months after the break-up.The man had moved the family court at Pune for temporary custody of the minor after he learnt that his partner had decided to shift back to New Zealand with the child. Claiming that the woman was mentally unstable and unable to be a guardian, the man had also sought an order restricting her from taking the child out if India.He moved the HC after the family court rejected his plea. HC too dismissed his claims.Justice SC Gupte said the man claimed that the child was born not out of wedlock but out of a romantic relationship. “In other words, it is his own case that the child is an illegitimate child, and if that is so, it is difficult to see how he, as a putative biological father, can claim the custody of the child over the woman, who admittedly is his biological mother,” the judge added.Justice Gupte said under section 6 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act the mother is the natural guardian of an illegitimate boy or an illegitimate unmarried girl, and the father’s claim of guardianship comes only after hers.There are only two exceptions to this rule – either the woman ceases to be a Hindu or completely renounces the material world and becomes a hermit or an ascetic, HC said. Thus, it added, the woman had an indefeasible claim to natural guardianship of her child.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/woman-has-primary-claim-on-children-hc/story-RwX5iYnIYyFIZfGaZTLiXO.html
12-06-2020||Mumbai||Petrol price rises to ₹80.98, diesel to ₹70.92||Fuel prices surged in the city on Thursday with petrol price increasing by 58 paise for each litre, bringing the price to ₹80.98 a litre from ₹80.40 a litre. Diesel price also increased to ₹70.92 for each litre from ₹70.35 a litre. Petrol and diesel prices saw a hike for the fifth consecutive day in metro cities across the country. Transporters have protested the daily increase in fuel prices. “There has been a consistent increase in petrol and diesel prices in the country. About 70% of the retail price of fuel constitutes Central and state taxes, which is about 275% and 255% over the base price for petrol and diesel, respectively. Transporters cannot absorb the daily hike as the freight depends mostly on demand and supply forces. The road transport fraternity of India strongly protests the daily hikes that are making their operations unviable,” said Bal Malkit Singh, chairman and former president of All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/petrol-price-rises-to-80-98-diesel-to-70-92/story-XcjR1jXnOgg68p16nSNCUK.html

12-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to probe case of 62-year-old who couldn’t be traced for 48 hours||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday initiated an enquiry into the incident involving a 62-year-old suspected Covid patient, whose family could not locate the woman for around 48 hours after she was admitted to the Covid care facility in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) last week and later moved to Sion Hospital, where she died. The enquiry will be headed by Prashant Narnaware, one of the five IAS officers appointed by the civic body to keep a check on bed management at private hospitals. Narnaware said preliminary information is being collected about the entire case.The patient, Gyanti Devi, was first admitted at the BKC facility at 5am on June 2 with breathing issues and lower body pain. The same afternoon, as many as 200 patients were moved from the BKC centre to the Covid care facility at NSCI Exhibition Centre in Worli and Sion Hospital due to the threat of Cyclone Nisarga. Gyanti Devi was taken to Sion Hospital, where she succumbed on June 3.Her grandson, Sandeep Sharma, had to run from pillar to post for 48 hours to locate Gyanti Devi. The family claim they did not receive any intimation from the BKC facility about transferring Gyanti Devi even though they had submitted their contact details. Sharma and his family then did the rounds of Worli NSCI and Sion Hospital for two days, but could not find Gyanti Devi at both places. Finally, on the evening of June 4, while enquiring with the Sion Hospital staff, the family was told that there was an unclaimed body of a woman who had died on June 3. “We searched in all wards at Sion Hospital and went to the enquiry counter multiple times. The staff then suspected that she could have died and they contacted the Sion crematorium. They then found out that an unclaimed body had been sent to the cremation. It was my grandmother,” said Sharma. After Sharma reach the crematorium, the body was handed over to him, but the family still does not know if Gyanti Devi was Covid-19. Her body was handed over without conducting a Covid test although her death certificate states she died of type-two respiratory failure, lower respiratory tract infection, hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Respiratory failure with comorbidities is one of the causes of deaths in Covid-19 patients. HT reported about the case on Wednesday.“I will be looking into this, too, whether a test was conducted or not. We will do a thorough investigation. We are gathering details from the staff that was present on the day the patient was transferred at Sion,” Narnaware said. Civic chief Iqbal Chahal said the matter is being “examined”.Meanwhile, BJP leaders along with family members of Gyanti Devi have lodged a complaint at the BKC police station against the civic body, alleging criminal negligence by Sion Hospital and the BKC facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-probe-case-of-62-year-old-who-couldn-t-be-traced-for-48-hours/story-S9t4qrEejYjIeBmz0CTEKM.html

12-06-2020||Mumbai||Crop loans: State to sign agreement with banks||As banks are not ready to sanction fresh crop loans to defaulting farmers even after assurance from the Maharashtra government for repayment of loan amount under its loan waiver scheme, the state has now agreed to sign an agreement with the banks as a guarantee that they will get their money back by September.The move will bring relief to more than 11 lakh farmers who are eligible for the loan waiver scheme — Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Shetkari Karj Mukti Yojana — but could not avail its benefit as the state government is facing serious financial crisis owing to lockdown imposed after Covid-19 pandemic outbreak. The government had also expressed its inability to pay amount to the banks for the time being.On May 22 when the state government asked banks to provide crop loans to farmers saying the government was ready to pay the pending amount along with interest, banks were not ready to listen and demanded guarantee in black and white, officials said.“We have decided to sign an agreement with the banks to guarantee that they will receive the pending loan amount of the eligible farmers by September,” confirmed state cooperation minister Balasaheb Patil.“The process has started and the agreement will be soon signed with the banks. With the decision, all 11.12 lakh eligible farmers will get crop loans,” he said.The state government needs ₹8,100 crore to write off the debts of the farmers.“The draft of the agreement is ready. Soon banks will appoint someone who will be signing it on their behalf,” said a senior official requesting anonymity. He added that the rate of interest against the delay on the loan amount is yet to be decided.The loan waiver scheme promises to write off loans with an outstanding of up to ₹2 lakh for farmers from April 1, 2015 to September 30, 2019. The state has transferred ₹12,000 crore in the bank accounts of over 19 lakh beneficiaries so far, and the other 11.12 lakh beneficiaries are yet to get the benefit.In a meeting held on June 8 to review preparations for kharif season, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray expressed displeasure after he came to know that the nationalised banks have disbursed only 7% crop loans to farmers against the target set for the fiscal.Thackeray was informed that nationalised banks have disbursed ₹2,300 crore, which comes to 7%, and district central cooperative banks have sanctioned ₹6,250 crore as crop loans, 46% of the target determined for this year.The ongoing financial crisis has led the state government to declare a 67% cut in its expenditure for developmental works in this fiscal in view of the estimated revenue losses of more than ₹40,000 crore in March and April 2020 owing to Covid-19 outbreak.The state, expecting the cumulative losses to be more than ₹50,000 crore in the current fiscal, has also decided to not take up new development schemes and scrap or defer the schemes that can be put on hold. Among other measures, the government has also decided to stop recruitment for government jobs, meaning that recruitment underway for 35,000 posts is unlikely now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/crop-loans-state-to-sign-agreement-with-banks/story-t1WvNPNGIsvZhlFf9xRH4L.html
12-06-2020||City||97 Covid-19 deaths in Mumbai for second day in a row||The city on Thursday recorded 1,418 new Covid-19 cases and 97 deaths, taking the count to 54,085 and toll to 1,954. So far, 24,209 people – 44% of Mumbai’s total cases – have recovered. There are 27,915 active cases in Mumbai. The city recorded 97 deaths, the highest single-day figure, for two days in a row, on Wednesday and Thursday.According to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the recovery rate is high in patients in the 10-40 age group. Until May 30, which is the latest data available with BMC for age-wise closed cases (cases that had an outcome of recovery or death), 74% cases in the 10-20 age group recovered with 0% mortality. Similarly, 71% of cases in the 20-30 age group recovered with 0% mortality. In the 30-40 age group, 68% of the cases recovered, while 2% died.For cases in patients beyond 50 years of age, the percentage of closed cases has gone down, which means more patients in this age group are taking longer to recover and are still ailing. Also, among the closed cases, the mortality is higher. While 65% of cases in the 40-50 age group had an outcome, it was death in 6% of the cases, which means only 59% recovered. Of the 62% cases that had an outcome in the 50-60 age group, 11% were deaths, suggesting 51% recovery.In senior citizens, 57% cases in the 60-70 age group had an outcome, with 18% deaths (39% recovery). In the 70-80 age group, 51% cases had an outcome – 30% recovery and 21% deaths.Daksha Shah, deputy executive health officer in BMC, said, “This is expected as younger people have better immunity to fight the infection. A higher percentage of older patients have co-morbidities. A sluggish metabolism among older people is another reason for longer recovery time. However, we have had cases where senior citizens are asymptomatic, and recover fast.”As of June 9, there were 9,993 cases in the 50-60 age group, with 523 deaths. There were 6,669 cases in the 60-70 age group, with 514 deaths. There were 9,420 cases 40-50 in the age group, with 281 deaths. On the contrary, there were 9,372 cases in the 30-40 age group, with only 85 deaths.Of the 97 deaths reported on Thursday, 43 occurred before June 7. Sixty-five had co-morbidities; 63 patients were men and 34 patients were women. Ten deaths were of people below 40 years, 53 above 60 years, and 34 between 40 and 60 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/97-covid-19-deaths-in-mumbai-for-second-day-in-a-row/story-PDFP8ah4miVjP7WMPG8IiP.html
12-06-2020||Mumbai||Second cluster varsity all set to begin admissions||Almost a year after the state cabinet approved the formation of a second cluster university in the state and city, the Hyderabad Sind National Collegiate University (HSNCU) was launched on Thursday. HSNCU will be open for admission for the academic year of 2020-21 as a cluster university that will bring together Hassaram Rijhumal College of Commerce and Economics (HR College), Kishinchand Chellaram College (KC College) in Churchgate as well as Bombay Teachers’ Training College in Colaba (all of which are part of the HSNCU board).The university was officially launched by Maharashtra governor and chancellor of state universities Bhagat Singh Koshyari and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray along with minister of higher and technical education Uday Samant.The first cluster university, Dr Homi Bhabha State University (HBSU), started admissions and operations in 2019-20. It brings together four existing colleges — the Institute of Science (ISc), Elphinstone College, Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics and Secondary Training (ST) College — all located in Fort and Churchgate.“This university is a step towards greater global academic standards and eventually towards economic independence. It will open up curriculum reforms and more autonomy in designing of syllabi,” said Niranjan Hiranandani, provost of the university. He added that HSNCU designed the syllabi in consultation with industry experts and top academicians to ensure its students are industry and future ready. Like HBSU, HSNCU too will introduce a range of integrated courses with options of interdisciplinary courses. “This university will allow horizontal mobility as well as creative options to students from all disciplines —commerce, humanities, science and economics,” said Hiranandani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/second-cluster-varsity-all-set-to-begin-admissions/story-dhAHxnIsbUfk1OCCx1bN3K.html

The child’s mother tried to rescue him but failed as she, too, got stuck in the muddy sludge of the nullah. While locals who had gathered rescued the mother, fire brigade officials have launched a search operation for the boy.According to Pantnagar police, the incident took place around 12.30pm when the boy, Hussain Hamid Shaikh, a resident of nearby slums, was playing near the 10-foot-deep nullah at Savitribai Phule Nagar in Ghatkopar (East). The boy slipped and fell into the nullah. His mother, upon seeing him in the nullah, jumped in to save him. “The mother had managed to hold the boy’s hand, but later he slipped away as the nullah was full of sludge. Locals rescued the woman,” said a police officer from Pantnagar police station.The fire brigade has launched a search operation using ropes, hooks, anchor and dingy boat.“The boy’s father has been helping police since long.

12-06-2020||Chandigarh||Not enough passengers, Punjab’s small private buses go off roads||Amritsar Small private bus operators and those running mini-buses in the state have decided to take their vehicles off roads, for now, with tepid response from passengers, even as the lockdown has been lifted. Livelihood of thousands of staffers, including drivers and conductors, has been hit. Operators say with no reduction in major fixed expenses like tax and insurance premium, operating with fewer passengers in view of social distancing norms did not make sense.“Livelihood of nearly 1 lakh people who work as drivers and conductors, is dependent on the operation of mini buses in the state. In Amritsar itself, there are 500 mini-bus operators, employing 1,500 persons. All are struggling for survival with no help from the government,” said Baldev Singh Babbu, president, Punjab Mini-Bus Operators Union.He added, “We pay Rs 3,100 per bus per month as tax for getting on the road. A huge financial crisis stares at us. Many operators will wind up business over the next few months.”Choudhary Ashok Manan, who operates buses from Amritsar to locations in Gurdaspur district, adds, “Unlike Kerala where a concession of 1/3 of quarterly tax has been offered to private buses, Punjab government has asked us to pay full tax. We pay approximately Rs 30,000 per bus per month as tax. The total insurance premium is Rs 93,000. Due to social distancing, we are to ferry a limited number of passengers. Fuel and wages remain high. Survival is nearly impossible.”Manan, who represents small private bus operators of Amritsar and Gurdaspur districts, said, “Around 80 small bus operators run around 500 private buses.” A bus driver Sher Singh, 46, who plies on the Amritsar-Pathankot route says, “For people like me, the lockdown is still on, as even now I am struggling to earn my daily wage of Rs 400. I am the only breadwinner and am living on borrowed money from friends or relatives. Transport must get normal, as I cannot find any other job now.” Operators also rue the fact that even in these tough times, those without their own garage for buses have to pay parking fee at the bus stand. Theft of batteries and tyres is also an issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/not-enough-passengers-punjab-s-small-private-buses-go-off-roads/story-ZfgDDDzn8UWoh7ZTPgjAII.html
12-06-2020||Mumbai||Signs of bickering in MVA||While the developments over the past few days suggest the three parties forming the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) are bickering over various issues, insiders claim more differences could crop up over various other issues, including nominations of party members to the Council and reshuffle of the bureaucracy. The Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) want the names for 12 members of the council to be recommended to the Governor at the earliest, while the Shiv Sena wants it to be handled cautiously. A tiff is also likely over extension for chief secretary Ajoy Mehta, as only the Sena is in favour of the move.The state recommends names to the Governor for nominations to the Council as per the constitutional provision under Article 171. The six-year term of 10 of the 12 council members appointed from the Governor’s quota in 2014 ended last week, while two others will retire on June 15. The Sena, NCP and Congress are expected to give four names each for the vacant seats. The Congress and NCP state chiefs have reportedly approached chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for a decision on the vacant council posts.“We have asked the chief minister for a coordination meeting to finalise the quota and names to be recommended by taking a decision in the cabinet. The list should have been sent before the term ended on June 6, but there is no discussion yet,” said a senior Congress leader.The ruling parties feel the Governor may stall the recommendation, similar to the situation when Thackeray’s name was recommended two months ago. The Congress leader said the Sena leadership is treading cautiously, as it does not want another tussle with the Governor. Meanwhile, Mehta’s second extension ends on June 30. Thackeray is reportedly in favour of giving him another term of three months in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. The Congress and NCP have opposed the move. “Mehta is also likely to be appointed in a special role in the chief minister’s office. The two ruling parties are against any such move,” said an NCP leader.The leader said they were of the opinion that the administration is enjoying dominance in decision-making and it has been proven true after a showdown between ministers and bureaucrats in the cabinet meeting on Tuesday, where NCP leader and food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal slammed Mehta for bringing a proposal in the cabinet without having consulted with him. Even as Thackeray claimed on Wednesday that there was no face-off between the ministers and officers, the Congress held two meetings of its senior leaders over the past two days. “The Congress is part of the ruling alliance and we have our own expectations. We want to have a say in decision-making and will convey our feelings to the CM,” Congress state chief Balasaheb Thorat said. Political analyst Hemant Desai said there are differences within the MVA, but it has not reached the stage of bickering. “NCP chief Sharad Pawar was known as a leader with full command over bureaucracy, but in the given scenario, he does not appear to be happy with the way the administration is functioning. The stand-off between ministers and bureaucrats in the cabinet meeting was an indicator that three ruling parties are not on the same page,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/signs-of-bickering-in-mva/story-LFJiRERKeUShHTqjay4oGO.html
12-06-2020||Mumbai||Gujarat university designs Covid testing unit in autorickshaw||In an effort to boost testing facilities and provide portable oxygen facilities, Anant National University has designed a compact, mobile and contact-free Covid-19 testing and oxygen facility in a cargo autorickshaw. The Gujarat-based university has created three variations of the rickshaw. One is an oxygen response facility with a stretcher that can act as an emergency response vehicle, one with contact-free swab testing facilities for two patients, and one with x-ray testing and swab-collection facilities. While the first two cost ₹4.25 lakh and ₹5.4 lakh respectively, the rickshaw with x-ray facilities will cost ₹11.4 lakh. The autorickshaws are also fitted with a stretcher on the side to transport patients to the hospital. A large number of patients have not been able to access ambulances and hospitals in Mumbai in the past few days. “These are compact autorickshaws that can reach the narrow lanes of slums and facilitate door-to-door testing. The interiors of the facility are also partitioned in three chambers, one for the driver, one for healthcare provider and one for the patient,” said Dr Miniya Chatterji, Director, Anant Centre for Sustainability, and CEO of Sustain Labs. The vehicle for swab testing is contact-free as it is fitted with two windows from which healthcare providers can collect swab samples.The university is in talks with local governments in Maharashtra and Gujarat where the facilities are expected to roll out soon, said Chatterji. To run the equipment 24x7, a diesel generator is fitted on top of the vehicle. Professor Dhaval Monani, Director of Affordable Housing and Associate Professor, Anant National University who designed the rickshaws, said in order to maintain high standards of sanitation, the patient area comes with an automated sanitiser spray that is activated by four jet nozzles that thoroughly disinfect the area each time a patient leaves the chamber.“We found two challenges in the country with Covid-19. One is that the testing costs are high and the second is that patients are not able to make it to the hospital in time owing to shortage of ambulances. Therefore, in consultation with different medical practitioners, we re-engineered the autorickshaw so that the facility can reach all patients,” Monani said. The university had earlier designed cardboard beds that have been utilised in quarantine facilities in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/gujarat-university-designs-covid-testing-unit-in-autorickshaw/story-veOxxNmISphbtRNBvquoWO.html
12-06-2020||Mumbai||State delays schedule, RTE students can’t confirm seats||Even as the state education department has announced the commencement of new academic year from June 15, admissions under the 25% Right to Education (RTE) quota have still not begun across the state, leaving thousands of students in a lurch. Several students who have been allotted schools based on the RTE lottery are waiting for the state government to release a schedule following which they can confirm their admission.A delay in starting the admission process means that the students who have applied for admissions under RTE quota are unable to take part in the online classes of the respective schools. “My son got allotted to a school through the lottery. We got to know that the school has already started its online classes for the year 2020-21. However since his admission is not yet done, the school is unable to put him on their rolls and he is missing out on online learning,” said the parent of a Class 1 student from Khargar. An official from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s education department who is in-charge of RTE admissions said the government is yet to issue any directive on the matter. “We are waiting for official instructions from the government about admissions. Once a schedule is out, we will start the process,” said the official. Officials from the state education department did not respond to calls and messages. This year a total of 14,135 students applied for RTE seats in Mumbai, of whom 5,371 have been allotted schools through online lottery. More than one lakh students were selected in a lottery for admissions to Senior KG and Class 1 under the quota across the state. While the lottery for admissions was conducted in March this year, admissions have still not started.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-delays-schedule-rte-students-can-t-confirm-seats/story-DwoOujVj6cnIKfAFOvZnTL.html
12-06-2020||City||Woman kills 7-year-old daughter, herself at Badlapur residence||A 30-year-old woman killed her seven-year-old daughter before dying by suicide at their Badlapur residence on Wednesday night. On Thursday Badlapur (East) police registered an offence against the deceased woman, who was the wife of a constable from Deonar police station, under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), for murder. The case was registered after the woman’s 64-year-old mother-in-law filed a complaint with the police. According to the police, the incident took place at Shirgaon in Badlapur (East) around 11.30pm on Wednesday. “The daughter was sleeping with the mother-in-law initially. Around 11.30pm the accused woman took her daughter to her bedroom. After a few minutes, the mother-in-law heard screams and she rushed to the room, which was locked. She then called the neighbours and the police were alerted,” said Harshal Kulkarni, assistant inspector, Badlapur (East) police station. “The mother had stabbed the daughter multiple times with a knife and later she killed herself. Both were rushed to Badlapur rural hospital and were declared dead there,” said Kulkarni. Primarily, it is suspected that the mother had a history of mental illness as per the statement provided by her husband. “The husband was not at the residence when the incident took place.

12-06-2020||Chandigarh||Sultanpur Lodhi farmers take to DSR sowing of paddy||Kapurthala Farmers in the sub-division of Sultanpur Lodhi in the district have planted around 50% of the area under paddy using the Direct Seeding of Rice (DSR) technology. Of 34,000 hectare under paddy, 16,000 hectare has used this technology. This is a major increase over last year, when the area under DSR was negligible (just 90 hectare). Using this technology that involves fertilising and planting directly into the soil, using a machine, the farmer can cut down on cultivation cost in terms of labour and water.Farmers, however, need to be extreme vigilant against weeds when they grow this variety, said Sultanpur Lodhi agriculture development officer, Jaspal Singh Dhanju. “Farmers of this region are enterprising. This year, they have gone in for DSR technology, and that too after modifying the zero till drill, mainly used for wheat sowing,” Dhanju added. Baldev Singh from Talwandi Chaudriyan village said he had gone in for DSR in 450 acre. Another farmer Harman Singh from Nurowal village said he had used the technology in entire land holding. Farmers Ajaypal Singh and Yuvraj Singh from Sarai Jattan village, who own the machine for DSR sowing of paddy, said the technique had gained popularity as they had sown over 650 acre on rental basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sultanpur-lodhi-farmers-take-to-dsr-sowing-of-paddy/story-xTKqXaD5oS5vHcpgKVzVqO.html

12-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab agri dept yet to identify farmers who bought spurious paddy seeds||Though the paddy sowing has begun, the state agriculture department is yet to identify the farmers who purchased ‘spurious’ seeds, mainly PR128 and PR129 varieties.The kharif season was marred by the seed scam with recovery of unauthorised seeds of the said varieties from private seed producers and traders across the state in past three weeks.The failure of the agriculture department in identifying the buyers may cost the farmers dear as experts believe the spurious seeds will affect the paddy production.It may be mentioned that the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) introduced these varieties for the first time and didn’t provide the source seed to any private player. The PAU sold the seeds directly to farmers.Already, there are reports of seed samples collected from Ludhiana’s private Brar Seeds Store failing the germination test, while the reports of samples confiscated from Patiala, Gurdaspur, Bathinda, Muktsar and other parts of the state are still awaited.Agriculture director Sutantar Kumar Airi said the seed producers illegally sold seeds claiming they were of PR128 and PR129 varieties. “The district heads of agriculture department have already been directed to find how much of unauthenticated seeds have been sold in the open market,” Airi said.Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda) said the department was already late in taking action. “The farmers who purchased these seeds have already sown them or have transplanted saplings for manual transplantation of paddy,” Singh said.Patiala chief agriculture officer Surjit Singh Walia said they were taking all precautions and have directed block-level officers to take feedback from farmers on the crop. “It is not possible on the ground to identify farmers who purchased seed varieties from unauthorised dealers,” Walia said.Farmers were sold PR128 and PR139 varieties for ₹200-250 per kg by private players even as PAU was making available the same for ₹70 per kg.As per the PAU, PR128 matures in about 111 days, while PR129 takes about 108 days to mature, which is three weeks earlier than PUSA 44.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-agri-dept-yet-to-identify-farmers-who-bought-spurious-paddy-seeds/story-y7UKZKbFYnPozAF3z5lp1N.html
12-06-2020||Mumbai||Monsoon arrives in Maharashtra; Mumbai misses its date||The weather bureau on Thursday declared the onset of the south-west monsoon over parts of south Konkan and south-central Maharashtra, but Mumbai missed its date.An orange alert (be prepared) has been issued for Sunday for the entire Konkan coast including Mumbai, Thane and Palghar for heavy to very heavy rain across isolated areas. A yellow alert (be updated) has been issued for Friday and Saturday for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) for the possibility of heavy rain or thunderstorms across isolated areas.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said monsoon had advanced into parts of Konkan, central Maharashtra, and Marathwada on Thursday with the onset line passing through Harnai in Ratnagiri district and Solapur district in southwest Maharashtra.“The conditions are favourable for further advancement of monsoon in some more parts of Maharashtra, including Mumbai, over the next 48 hours. A warning for heavy rainfall has been issued,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, IMD. “Rain intensity is likely to increase across the Konkan coast, central Maharashtra and Marathwada owing to a low pressure area over Bay of Bengal (around north Andhra Pradesh and south Odisha coast), a cyclonic circulation over south Gujarat region, and an active offshore trough extending from Karnataka to Kerala.”According to IMD’s new onset dates released last month, normal onset for Maharashtra is around June 8. Last year, Maharashtra and Mumbai witnessed its most delayed monsoon onset in 45 years on June 20. In 2018 and 2017 it was June 8, while it was delayed in 2016 and 2015 on June 18 and 14. Earlier this week, IMD had predicted that the onset of monsoon is expected in Mumbai around Thursday (June 11). “But the progression of monsoon towards Mumbai was marginally delayed because of a slight slower movement of the weather system over the Bay of Bengal. However, the onset over Maharashtra and expected onset over Mumbai by June 13 will still be considered as normal onset as we consider a standard deviation of plus-minus seven days for monsoon arrival,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD.Independent meteorologists, however, said present weather conditions over southern Maharashtra were not conducive enough to declare monsoon onset. “Monsoon winds are yet to reach Konkan and south-central Maharashtra since the near-surface wind direction over these areas is from the northwest instead of required west or southwest. The wind pattern over a region needs to be seriously considered, while declaring the monsoon’s progression,” said Akshay Deoras, meteorologist and PhD researcher at the department of meteorology, University of Reading, the United Kingdom (UK). “Several models including that of the IMD continue to indicate the arrival of the monsoon in most of Konkan, including Mumbai during June 14-16.”Mahesh Palawat, vice president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet said, “Conditions look favourable for monsoon onset over Mumbai by June 14 or 15.” Skymet had earlier said onset was expected on June 13.Deoras added that coastal districts of Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri and Raigad were expected to receive moderate to heavy rain between June 14 and 16. “Mumbai is likely to witness more persistent and some intense showers during June 15 and 16,” he said.Mumbai and its suburbs recorded light overnight showers between Wednesday night and Thursday morning. South Mumbai recorded 1.1 mm rain, while the suburbs received 5.6 mm. No rain was recorded between 8.30am and 5.30pm Thursday as the maximum and minimum temperatures were close to the normal mark.MUMBAI FLOOD WARNING SYSTEM TO BE LAUNCHED TODAYThe country’s second urban flood warning system will be launched on Friday by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Union minister Dr Harsh Vardhan. HT had reported on Wednesday that the system will provide early warning for flooding, specially during high rainfall events and cyclones. Jointly conceived by several departments of the ministry of earth sciences and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the system will estimate ward wise flood levels, assess vulnerable areas and identify mitigation measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/monsoon-arrives-in-maharashtra-mumbai-misses-its-date/story-1xypiPFiJcKedFfLunCHfJ.html
12-06-2020||Mumbai||Record spike for 2nd day in a row takes Maha closer to 1 lakh cases||For a second consecutive day, Maharashtra recorded its highest 24-hour jump in coronavirus cases with 3,607 more infections on Thursday, taking the tally to 97,648. The government said it is ready to tackle the surge anticipated after relaxing lockdown curbs. The state announced the addition of doctors and beds in Mumbai, even as it pushed for slashing the restriction period for containment zones by half and reiterated its demand for resumption of local train services for essential services workers.The state’s Covid-19 death toll also rose by 152 — 35 casualties in the past two days and the remaining in the past nine weeks — pushing the fatality count to 3,590. India’s worst-affected city, Mumbai, reported 1,418 new cases and 97 more deaths, pushing its tally and toll to 54,085 and 1,954 respectively.State health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday asked the Union health ministry to reduce the restriction period in containment zones from 28 days to 14 days. Tope made the request during a meeting with Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan.The state’s recovery rate is 47.2%, as 46,078 patients are reported to have recovered so far, with 1,561 patients discharged on Thursday. The recovery rate in the state was 26.25% on May 20, 29.06% on May 24, 31.26% on May 28 and improved to 43.38% on May 29. Tope described the current availability of ICU beds in Mumbai as “hand-to-mouth”. However, he said the city will get 500 additional ICU beds by next week. The minister said the state and local administration in Mumbai is prepared to tackle a spike in cases. He said that beds in Covid Care Centres (CCC), Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHC) are available.“We are prepared to tackle the situation even if there is a spike in the coming days following the lifting of curbs. The beds at CCC and DCHC, where there is an oxygen line with beds, are available. The current situation of ICU beds today is hand-to-mouth, but in the next eight days, an additional 500 ICU beds will be made operational in Mumbai,” Tope said.The minister said the state government is getting more doctors to ensure there is no shortage of doctors in Mumbai . “We are getting around 200 to 300 doctors from other districts to serve in Mumbai. Our preparedness plan is in place. There will be no shortage of beds or doctors,” he saidThe state, meanwhile, wants to reduce the period needed for restrictions in containment zones. Containment zones are areas where a significant number of cases have been detected, after which the authority puts movement restrictions in those areas and implements strict lockdown measures. The area is declared free after there is no case reported in 28 days after the last case tests negative.Heavy police deployment is made outside these areas to ensure the effective implementation of norms. As of June 9, Mumbai alone has 798 containment zones in the city. A statement from Tope said that the minister made a request to the Centre to take a re-look at the norms and halve it to reduce the strain on the police personnel deployed outside hotspots.“All activities are restricted inside a containment zone until no cases are reported for 28 days. Heavy police deployment is done to ensure the implementation is carried and a large chunk of the police is deployed in these areas. The Centre should look at reducing these curbs from 28 days to 14 so that the police force can be rested and put on duty elsewhere. The Centre should issue guidelines on this,” the statement said.Of the 152 deaths reported on Thursday, 35 were from the last two days while remaining had taken place from April 1 to June 8. Of the total fatalities, 119 are from Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), including 97 from Mumbai, nine from Mira Bhayander and seven from Kalyan-Dombivli. Eight each were from Pune and Solapur. 85 of the people who died were above 60 years of age and 107 of them had comorbidities.A total of 15,533 samples have been tested in the past 24 hours, with a positivity rate of 23.22%. With 41 private and 54 owned by the government, state has 95 laboratories for coronavirus tests. Currently, 5,73,606 people are under home quarantine.Tope also reiterated the state government’s demand to resume suburban train services for the workforce in essential and emergency services. “I have requested the Union health minister that limited local train services for the workforce in essential and emergency services should be allowed. I am confident he would discuss the demand with the prime minister and we expect a decision at the earliest.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday had reiterated the demand to start local train services so that people who reside in far-flung suburbs and employed at hospitals and in other essential services can resume work to tackle the Covid-19 situation in the city.According to the officials from the state government, the Centre has been informed how it is important to ease out the stress on essential services, including healthcare workers and police. “After private offices are allowed to operate, BEST buses are plying at crowded areas, making it difficult for these frontline workers to commute. We cannot be fully dependent on road transport, while easing restrictions,” the officer said. The mortality rate in the state went up in the past few days, reaching 3.7% on Thursday, from 3.25% on May 25 and 3.37% on May 31, even as the national rate witnessed a gradual fall. The national mortality rate too saw bit of rise and reported 2.83% on Thursday from 2.78% on Sunday, but it has been on a gradual slide from 3.06% on May 21 and 2.84% on May 31.“There could be a marginal hike in the rate, but it’s not worrisome as the difference it not too high. The rise may be because of a few elements related to test, disease pattern, late admission and it has been witnessed globally. Our mortality is well within control, compared to other countries,” said Dr Avinash Supe, former KEM dean and member of the expert committee appointed by the state to recommend steps to curb the spread. Dr Supe said that the surge the state has been witnessing a mix of trends, as in some parts like Dharavi the cases are on decline, while in some areas like Malad, the cases are on the rise. “Until we are prepared with good health infrastructure and patients are getting required line of treatment, there is no need to worry about the surge,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/record-spike-for-2nd-day-in-a-row-takes-maha-closer-to-1-lakh-cases/story-xPQuZxmTquaQG8YBfQivxK.html
12-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab govt allows its offices to have 100% staff, but with strict protocol||CHANDIGARH The Punjab government has allowed its offices across the state to function with up to 100% staff, provided strict social distancing, and sanitisation protocol is followed.The permission has been granted by the personnel department after chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh held a meeting with administrative secretaries of all departments. “The heads of departments (HoDs) have been allowed to decide their staff requirement in office and they can have up to 100% attendance from today. They do not need special permission now, but have been asked to keep the chief secretary’s office in the loop,” a senior officer said, quoting the instructions issued to all HoDs, administrative secretaries and deputy commissioners on Wednesday.The state government, which has 3.15 lakh employees, had only permitted the departments providing essential and emergency services such as health, police, power, water supply and fire to work with full staff strength till now whereas other departments that deal with non-essential services were allowed to first work with a skeletal staff and later have a maximum of 50% employees in the office at any time.The restrictions on work from office have been eased even as Covid-19 positive cases saw an increase of almost 32% in the state during the past 15 days, going up from 2,139 on May 27 to 2,805 on June 10. However, the personnel department has issued a strict protocol to check the spread of coronavirus. “The departments have been directed to divide their staff into separate teams and ensure they do not meet each other so that if any employee tests positive, the entire working is not affected and only members of that particular team go into quarantine as per the guidelines issued by the health department,” said the official, who did not want to be named.As for the departments working with less than 50% attendance, HoDs have been allowed to rotate their staff on a weekly basis or alternate days. The chief secretary had initially allowed weekly rotation of staff but some departments sought flexibility and more attendance in office, according to sources.The latest guidelines have been issued after feedback was gathered by the chief secretary’s office from all HoDs through a 33-point questionnaire regarding their Covid-19 plan, sanitisation, compliance with social distancing norms, use of masks, sitting arrangements, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-govt-allows-its-offices-to-have-100-staff-but-with-strict-protocol/story-OZmrnag5CNcEjesasJiZgJ.html
12-06-2020||Chandigarh||Pak court denies bail to 3 in Sikh youth’s killing||A Pakistani court has rejected the bail applications of three accused allegedly involved in the killing of a Sikh youth in the country’s restive northwestern tribal region.Parvinder Singh, 25, was shot dead by unknown gunmen weeks before his marriage in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in January this year.Additional sessions judge of a Mardan city court Khursheed Iqbal rejected the applications after prosecution counsel Asfandyar Yusafzai opposed them, saying there are solid evidences against the accused.The data relating to the foreign remittances made to Prem Kumari, 18, fiancée of Singh among other evidences are available, the counsel said.Singh’s killing had drawn sharp condemnation from India which demanded exemplary punishment to the perpetrators of the crime.Prem was arrested for her alleged involvement in plotting the murder.The police in its initial report stated that Singh and Prem loved each other. After their engagement with their consent, they started preparations for the marriage.However, Prem befriended a Muslim boy, who happened to be the brother of her friend, they said.Prem called Singh to Mardan where her friends killed him and dumped the body in open fields near Chamakani, a rural area, where police found it on January 5, they said.Prem’s father is a Hindu and mother is a Sikh. Singh had returned to Pakistan after working in Malaysia for six years.The murder took place a day after a mob attacked Gurdwara Nankana Sahib.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pak-court-denies-bail-to-3-in-sikh-youth-s-killing/story-AwDOxULHRMQ26vhXpyBmzK.html
12-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram administration issues draft SOP for Covid treatment; plans to increase beds||The district administration has prepared the standard operating procedure (SOP) for the clinical management of Covid-19 patients in both private and public hospitals across the city. From providing functional services at the hospitals to procedures to be followed for attending suspected patients, the draft copy of the SOP lays down the rules for handling Covid-19 cases and states that a hospital can refer a Covid-19 patient elsewhere only if it lacks enough beds.“It will be the responsibility of the hospital to transfer the patient to another hospital in the absence of enough beds and till that happens, the hospital would provide available medical facilities,” reads the draft SOP, accessed by HT. Several instances have been reported in the city over the past few weeks, in which private hospitals have refused to admit Covid-19 patients. The deputy commissioner in May also issued an order, making it mandatory for the hospitals to take every Covid-19 patient. At least three private hospitals have been issued notices for allegedly turning away Covid-19 patients.The SOP allows private hospitals to transfer patients with mild or moderate symptoms to Covid care centres, which include self-paid and government-paid isolation facilities. The guidelines state that patients who do not require to be admitted in hospital because of their mild and moderate symptoms, but can’t be home-isolated either due to lack of space, will have to be transferred by the hospital to isolation centres. The district administration has already arranged more than 1,000 beds for isolation in more than 20 hotels and guest houses.“The criteria is to keep aside beds for patients who need immediate treatment facilities. If the patient does not require hospitalisation, he/she will have to be transferred to isolation facilities. Before such a transfer, the patient has to be counselled,” said Vivek Kalia, nodal officer for health facilities. He added that the challenge many hospitals have been facing is that Covid-19 patients, who don’t need hospitalisation, insist upon getting admitted. Data shows that of the 1,858 active cases, 538 patients are hospitalised and the rest are in quarantine, either at home or other facilities. A total of 335 beds are currently occupied by the confirmed Covid-19 cases; 62 suspected patients have been admitted for having ILI (influenza-like illness) or SARI (severe acute respiratory infection) like symptoms and given their samples for testing. 102 patients are admitted in ICUs of private hospitals, 37 patients are under ventilator support, while two of the Covid-19 positive patients are on dialysis.To check the availability of beds in isolation centres, hospitals will have to coordinate with the nodal officer of the isolation facility. “All the information about availability of beds and isolation facilities will be soon available on the portal called coronaharyana.in,” said Kalia. Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer, said, “A total of 63 Covid-19 positive patients are in government paid hotels, while 31 in self-paid hotels.”As per the SOP, every hospital needs to have separate counter for a Covid-19 patient. The guideline, however, doesn’t mention the time duration under which patient has to be admitted. It only states that doctors on triage duty must attend to the patient immediately depending upon the urgency of the requirement of treatment. The guideline also focuses upon recording and reporting mechanisms of data, where hospitals will have to follow standardized reporting protocol. Each hospital will get a unique ID/password to access an internal portal to feed the data which has to be updated twice in day.For the treatment in hospitals, the guidelines say that the patient will be managed as per the medical protocol and there will be minimal interaction between quarantine people and healthcare professional so that transmission of disease is prevented and controlled.Besides, the health facility management team is in the process of acquiring 1,000-1,500 additional beds. Kalia said, “As the number of cases are likely to increase further in the city, we are trying to augment the existing infrastructure. Bed capacity for Covid-19 patients in SGT Medical College will be increased to 120 from 80. The college has offered 300 beds for quarantine. 10 additional hospitals under the Clinical Establishment Act will all also be requisitioned.” Currently, 921 beds are reserved in 23 hospitals for Covid-19 patients across the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-administration-issues-draft-sop-for-covid-treatment-plans-to-increase-beds/story-qDk94cuKSAgNmAcmjt5KeN.html

12-06-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER refuses to treat critically ill frontline Covid warrior, then admits her after 6 hours||She tested positive for Covid-19 while working at the Sector 22 Civil Hospital and her condition deteriorated while she was being treated at the Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16 (GMSH-16). However, when referred to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), doctors there first refused to treat the frontline Covid warrior and then took six hours to admit her as a senior UT administration official intervened, it has been learnt.“The doctor, isolated at GMSH-16, developed critical symptoms on Wednesday evening. She was supposed to undergo supervised medical care at the Covid-19 hospital at PGIMER’s Nehru Hospital Extension Block,” said a senior UT official requesting anonymity.However, when a request was made to PGIMER for admitting her, the hospital refused and “a tussle ensued between the UT health department and the institute,” said the official.It was only after six hours of intense negotiations that PGIMER finally relented and accepted the patient. “A senior UT administration official had to take up the case with the institute’s authorities and only then was the patient admitted,” he added.The Covid-19 hospital has a 200 bed capacity and is equipped with ventilators. Currently, 12 patients are admitted at the centre, of which one is from Jammu and Kashmir, three from Haryana and two from Punjab. Among them seven patients are in the intensive care unit. When asked for a response, PGIMER spokesperson, Dr Ashok Kumar, said, “cases are first discussed by the institute’s doctors and their counterparts in other hospitals before referring patients.” “It must have taken time for the doctors to discuss the case, but I cannot confirm whether there was some issue or not as I do not have any intimation,” Dr Kumar said.Earlier, PGIMER had said that despite repeated requests, cases with mild Covid-19 symptoms and other minor ailments were coming in from neighbouring states, following which the UT adviser was asked to take up the matter with the states to ensure that such patients be treated locally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-refuses-to-treat-critically-ill-frontline-covid-warrior-then-admits-her-after-6-hours/story-I0FLZ5rx81EkURdHRGykUO.html
12-06-2020||Delhi||With leaf from Mumbai’s book, Delhi stadiums to turn Covid-19 hospitals||The Delhi government has earmarked 12,000 beds in banquet halls, 10,000 beds in a religious institute and 2,700 beds in two stadiums in its first round of scouting for spaces that can be turned into makeshift hospitals, anticipating a surge in Covid-19 cases.The modalities of the operation were worked out in a late-night meeting chaired by Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday. The Delhi government has also reached out to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the civic body in Mumbai, for insight into how they converted stadiums in the city into observation centres and Covid care facilities.Iqbal Singh Chahal, commissioner of the BMC, said, “Top officers from Delhi have approached me to help them with construction of Mumbai-like jumbo facilities in Delhi.”“The BMC has told us how they converted the NSCI Dome in Mumbai’s Worli area into a 457-bed facility. We will have a greater challenge on our hands because we are turning all these spaces into makeshift hospitals, while the BMC converted them into observation and Covid care centres. In the stadiums category, we have estimated bed capacities in two facilities so far. Pragati Maidan can accommodate up to 2,500 beds, keeping social distancing norms in mind, and Talkatora Stadium will have around 200 beds,” said a senior Delhi government official, asking to stay anonymous.The government has also identified more than 50 banquet halls across Delhi’s 11 districts and one religious institute in south Delhi’s Bhati area, to set up makeshift hospitals.Maharashtra cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray, who is monitoring Mumbai’s Covid-19 bed augmentation plan, said the city increased its municipal hospital beds from 400 to 5,000 in about a month. “Beyond that, we are making field hospitals, mostly in stadiums. We have operationalised about 15,000 beds at field modular hospitals, so far,” he said. Asked how the city addressed the issue of manpower shortage, Thackeray said, “Most of these field hospitals have contactless clinics, CCTV camera monitoring, remote sensing for patient parameters, and do-it-yourself processes for patients. These innovative measures have helped us operate these facilities with a thinly spread staff.”Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had, on Tuesday, said the Capital would have 550,000 cases of Covid-19 by July 31. On Wednesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal added that the city would concurrently need 150,000 beds to treat Covid-19 patients, including those coming from other states. To this effect, the government has put in place augmentation plans to meet the city’s hospital bed needs as cases of the infection rise.As per the list of banquet halls submitted by three districts — northwest, west and south — to the health department, which HT has accessed, the criteria set for the identification of such spaces included central air-conditioning, separate entries and exits, toilet facilities, pucca roof and pucca floor.The west district administration has identified 22 banquet halls that met the criterion. A total of 3,280 beds have been earmarked in these halls. The northwest district identified 13 banquet halls in Punjabi Bagh and Rajouri Garden areas that will accommodate 2,350 beds. The south district identified two halls, which may house 225 beds. The district also identified a large covered area owned by Radha Saomi Satsang Beas — a religious institution — in Bhati, which will accommodate 10,000 beds. However, the space does not have ACs, and only has fans. “We are focusing only on air-conditioned facilities in the first phase. All such makeshift hospitals will be divided into zones or enclosures for better management. These zones will also be split up for those who need critical care and those whose condition is not very serious. Sanitisers and essentials kits will be provided at every bed,” said a second senior government official. Arranging thousands of beds will not be a challenge, the official said, as many private companies have already presented before the government different versions of one-time use beds. The problem the government is facing now, though, is of staff shortage. “Getting medical personnel and supporting staff is the biggest challenge. Ideally, there should be one medical team for 10 patients, but because of manpower shortage, we might have to go with one team for 50 patients. We are making it clear that nursing associations and private hospitals will have to chip in with staff,” the official said. Banquet hall owners, however, wondered how the government will set up makeshift hospitals in their spaces since the majority of those operate on generators and they too are faced with a shortage of staffers. “All our workers have gone to their home states. Who will provide basic necessities such as plumbing and power supply? Most banquet halls also have very few toilets, especially those meant for females. There is no bathing area. A wedding is a matter of just six hours or so for which generators suffice, but running a full-fledged hospital on our generators is difficult,” said Ramesh Dang, president of Delhi Banquet Federation.In response, government officials said they will rope in the Public Works Department and the power department for civil engineering and power supply related tasks. “Bathrooms will have to be built in some places and power supply points for medical equipment will have to be set up and monitored. We are also considering putting up large LED screens for patients’ recreation,” the official added. Several mobile toilets will also have to be installed at every facility, which will also have dedicated ambulances, ICU/ventilators and oxygen concentrators, officials said. Swab collection centres and diagnostic centres will also be set up at every facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-leaf-from-mumbai-s-book-delhi-stadiums-to-turn-hospitals/story-iLSF6iXSJtsktSscufs4WI.html

No FIR was registered in Punjab in 2016 and only six and eight cases were filed in the subsequent two years, according to the study titled ‘Extent of Child Labour and Prosecution of Cases under CPLRA’.The findings of the study were released on Thursday, a day before the ‘World Day against Child Labour’ that is observed on June 12. The study ranks Punjab 15th among all states on the basis of number of children rescued from forced child labour under the provisions on the Act during the three-year period. The state’s additional chief secretary, labour, VK Janjua said the state government was alive to this problem. “There are district-level teams comprising officers of different departments. When we get any information, these teams immediately carry out raids, rescue children and register cases,” he said.Of the total 1,130 FIRs registered with rescue of 1,879 child workers during the three-year period, 313, or say 28%, were in Maharashtra where 420 victims were rescued and rehabilitated. Uttar Pradesh, which has the highest population of child labourers in the country, registered only 15 FIRs under CLPRA in the last three years, rescuing only 20 child labourers, says the study. Yadvinder Singh, state coordinator, Punjab, said the study is a secondary analysis of data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Census 2011 and information collected from government departments to assess efforts towards achieving the sustainable development goal of eliminating child labour by 2025 in the country.An analysis of prosecution of cases filed under CLPRA has brought out a huge gap between the number of prosecutions lodged in a year and the number of cases whose trials were completed, it said.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/world-day-against-child-labour-today-punjab-among-laggard-states-rescued-just-15-children-under-law-says-study/story-1BkU59zyQT9DFTwnAcLK4N.html
12-06-2020||Delhi||Pinjra Tod: Don’t share case info, high court to Delhi Police||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday restrained the city police from issuing any statements or circulating information to any person, including to the media or on social media platforms, regarding allegations and evidence allegedly collected against Devangana Kalita, student activist and member of women’s activisit group Pinjra Tod, who is currently lodged in jail in connection to her alleged involvement in the north-east Delhi riots.Justice Vibhu Bakhru issued notice to the Delhi police on the plea by Kalita, through her counsels Adit S Pujari and Kirti Awasthi, while directing the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Crime Branch to file a personal affidavit within two weeks detailing “affirming” the allegations made in the plea.Counsel for Kalita told the court that the Delhi Police, through a media note, and selective leaks to the media on contents of charge-sheets, has caused immense damage to her reputation and fundamental right to a fair trial and a presumption of innocence.The plea also said that such coverage, which is directly attributable to leaks of the Delhi Police, has caused Kalita to fear for her own safety, as also the safety of her relatives in Assam and her husband in Delhi.Advocate Chaitanya Gosain, appearing for the Delhi police, accepted the notice and said that he would file a reply on the petition. The matter would be now heard on July 9.Kalita was arrested by the Special Cell and charged under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for her alleged role in the conspiracy to the north-east Delhi riots which left more than 50 dead and several others injured. Kalita has been named in four separate FIRs by the city police, its Special Cell and its Crime Branch who are probing the riots.On June 3, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the crime branch members filed a charge sheet in a city court charging Pinjra Tod members—Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita—for “actively being involved in hatching the conspiracy to cause riots near Jaffarabad metro station on February 25. The police said that they were also part of a larger conspiracy and were found to be connected to the “India against Hate” group and its member Umar Khalid, a former union leader from the Jawaharlal Nehru University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pinjra-tod-don-t-share-case-info-high-court-to-delhi-police/story-uZAg1YsB15aKa9Ll302PlI.html

12-06-2020||Delhi||Man dies after he is thrashed in east Delhi on suspicion of being a thief||A 23-year-old man succumbed to injuries at a government hospital on Tuesday after he was beaten up by a crowd in east Delhi’s Pandav Nagar who suspected him of being a thief, the police said.The alleged assault was captured by CCTV cameras installed in the lane where the incident took place. The video clips show three men assaulting the man with sticks while at least three others stood by watching. The victim of the attack is not visible in the footage because of the parked vehicles.“The man was identified as Salman, a resident of Dadri in Uttar Pradesh. His previous involvement is being examined. A medical board has been constituted to conduct the man’s autopsy. Our probe is on,” deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said.According to the police, the incident took place in Pandav Nagar’s C-block early Tuesday morning, when one of the locals caught Salman and his friend on the rooftop of a building where they allegedly intended to commit a theft. When a local resident raised the alarm, the two men panicked and jumped off the rooftop.“Salman fell into a drain and got stuck while his associate fled. We have learnt that some locals beat him up with sticks before calling the police. A police team reached there and admitted Salman to a government hospital where he succumbed to injuries the same day. Prime facie, it appears that he died of internal injuries sustained in the attack,” an investigator, who asked not to be named, said.In another video clip, almost two hours after the alleged attack, two policemen are seen standing at the incident spot and, one of them, holding a stick, is signalling the injured man to get up. The policeman is further seen prodding the man from behind with the stick even as he limps through the lane, dangling a piece of rope tied around his left wrist.Police said they have also got a mobile phone video in which the injured man is lying on the ground and admitting that he and his associate had climbed the building with the intent to commit a theft. In that video, his hands was seen tied to some structure with ropes.One of the assaulters, identified as Rajesh Kumar, has been arrested and booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, a case regarding which was registered under Section 304 of Indian Penal Code at the Mandawali police station, said DCP Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-dies-after-he-is-thrashed-in-east-delhi-on-suspicion-of-being-a-thief/story-GRimr5Io2qEDA7ePkxT8qL.html
12-06-2020||Delhi||Businessman’s body found hanging from tree, nearly 40 km from his shop||A day after he went missing from outside his grocery store in east Delhi’s Karkardooma, a 37-year-old trader was found hanging from a tree with his hands tied behind in outer Delhi’s Baprola Vihar on Wednesday, police said. The man, Gaurav Bansal, lived with his family in a residential apartment in Patparganj. His family suspects he was abducted from outside his shop by unidentified persons, who murdered him and hanged his body near a lake in Baprola Vihar near Ranhola , 40 kilometres from Karkardooma. The family had filed a missing complaint at the Anand Vihar police station late Tuesday night. A case of murder has been registered and the police are probing the case from all possible angles.Deputy commissioner of police (outer) A Koan said the body was hanging from a rope near the banks of a lake around 8.30 am Wednesday and his hands were tied from behind. “We are probing the murder case,” Koan said.Bansal’s brother-in-law, Amit Kohli, said he had left home for the shop in his Creta car at 10.30 am on Tuesday. Bansal’s phone was switched off when his family members tried contacting him at 3 pm. Around 4 pm, they went to check on him and found that the shop’s shutter was partially closed and the employees were standing outside.“The employees told us Bansal left the shop around 2.30 pm, asking them to go out for their lunch. We got worried and approached the police when his wife, Shanu, got a call from an unknown person, who claimed to be calling from Pune. The man asked about my brother-in-law and abruptly disconnected the call when Shanu asked who he was,” said Kohli.According to Kohli, they called back on that phone and the person who answered the call said he lived in Delhi’s Mohan Garden, before disconnecting the call. “The phone is switched off since then and we suspect he knows something about my brother-in-law’s murder,” he added.Bansal’s family alleged that despite filing a missing complaint and giving information about activities on his social media profile, the police made no efforts to find him.“Around 2.30 am on Wednesday, there was some activity on my brother-in-law’s (Bansal) Facebook profile and it showed his location in Mandi House area. We alerted the police but they did not take any action, saying it would take at least a fortnight to get details regarding investigation from the social networking site,” said Kohli.The police said the family reported the matter late and did not suspect any foul play. Bansal’s wife in her complaint mentioned that he had suffered losses in business and had undergone treatment for depression, a senior police officer from Shahdara district said, requesting anonymity. The officer quoting his wife said he had taken a personal loan of R6 lakh and had lost around R 3.50 lakh after somebody stole his wallet and illegally used his credit card.“Our Anand Vihar personnel were already looking for Bansal when the Ranhola police informed them about his body,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/businessman-s-body-found-hanging-from-tree-nearly-40-km-from-his-shop/story-kuZUoajoVqMPxGKst8GzcO.html
12-06-2020||Delhi||After Kasturba Gandhi, Hindu Rao docs threaten mass resignation over salaries||The Delhi High Court on Thursday took suo moto cognisance of news reports related to non-payment of salaries to doctors of Hindu Rao and the Kasturba Gandhi hospitals. Advocate Akhil Mittal, standing counsel for the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, the nodal agency for all the three civic bodies, confirmed that the court had taken note of the reports and will hear a plea on it on Friday.Earlier in the day, resident doctors at the North corporation-run Hindu Rao Hospital in Malka Ganj on Thursday threatened to tender mass resignations if pending salaries for four months were not paid by June 18.Just a day ago, doctors of Kasturba Gandhi Hospital in the walled city had also warned of a similar move if their salaries were not disbursed by June 16. Calling for mass resignations, the resident doctors’ association of Hindu Rao Hospital said in a letter, “...with every passing day it’s getting very hard and tedious to get through the daily expenses of a lot of doctors. It’s cumbersome to commute to work and earn livelihood. We feel our voices are unheard. We request you to release our pending salaries (not just one month) by June 18...we are helpless to inform you that we are choosing ‘no pay, no work’ rule in order to mark agitation and if issues persist, we might have to take uncalled decision in the form of mass resignations.”“We have not been given salary since February 2020. Now it’s becoming very hard to manage. We cannot work without pay for long. We can understand one month’s delay at a time of Covid-19 pandemic but it has been four months now and we are yet to get our salaries. We can’t work like this. We will tender mass resignations after June 18 if our pending salaries are not cleared,” Abhimanyu Sardana, president Hindu Rao Hospital Residents’ Doctors Association, said.Earlier in April and May, Hindu Rao doctors had raised the issue of non-payment of salaries and had threatened to go on strike. Sardana said it had become a regular feature as salaries were never released on time despite several communications with the hospital and corporation authorities. There are around 250 resident doctors at Hindu Rao, which is north corporation’s largest hospital.The north corporation runs hospitals such as Hindu Rao, Maharishi Valmiki Infectious Diseases, Kasturba Hospital, Girdhari Lal Maternity Hospital and Rajan Babu Institute of Pulmonary Medicine and Tuberculosis. According to civic officials, the corporation employs around 1,000 senior doctors, 500 resident doctors, and 1,500 nursing officers.North corporation mayor Avtar Singh said they were in constant touch with doctors and their salaries would be released in a week. “We are trying our best to pay our doctors and teachers. But since our income had been curtailed due to the lockdown and the Delhi government has not yet released our Rs 1,500 crore, we are unable to pay the workforce in the hard times of coronavirus pandemic,” the mayor said.The Delhi government did not respond to requests for a comment.Jai Prakash, the standing committee chairperson of the north Delhi corporation, said, “We need Rs 350 Crore per month to pay salaries in different departments. We are making efforts and we will pay the salaries of our doctors in a week’s time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-kasturba-gandhi-hindu-rao-docs-threaten-mass-resignation-over-salaries-hc-takes-suo-moto-notice/story-evXoN7kiuimuiVCd6BotAI.html
12-06-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19: Gurugram doubling rate highest among 20 worst- affected districts in India||After recording a Covid-19 case doubling rate of 36 days in the last week of April, Gurugram now has a rate of a week. This is the highest among the 20 worst affected districts in the country (by case load), according to data from the Union ministry of health, since at least June 7. Experts say this shrinkage in rate implied that the containment measures have been inadequate and that increased transmission could result in a surge in cases.While the position of different districts on the ministry data sheet varies every day, Gurugram had a doubling rate of around seven days throughout May. A faster doubling rate, experts said, indicates continuing transmission of the coronavirus among the population, and a surge in the number of cases.In comparison, latest data for the three worst affected districts in terms of cases -- Maharashtra’s Mumbai (over 52,500 confirmed cases) and Thane (over 14,700), and Tamil Nadu’s Chennai (over 25,000) --- the doubling rates was 19, 15 and 13 days, respectively. In neighbouring Delhi (34,687 cases), the doubling rate was 12.6 days. The national average is 17 days, while for Haryana it is eight days.On Thursday, Gurugram recorded a total of 2737 cases, with 191 fresh cases. The city suffered 19 deaths due to the coronavirus disease.Experts warned that Gurugram’s lower doubling rate points to another surge in cases in coming days. “India is still in a phase of linear growth, not exponential growth, so the doubling-rate metric is not particularly important at this stage. However, a faster doubling-rate means that cases will definitely rise in the near future, and authorities need to prepare by ramping up testing, contact tracing, and making preparations for hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and ventilators,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, epidemiologist and former professor at the department of community medicine, PGIMS Chandigarh.At the current daily growth rate of cases for Gurugram, which stands at 10.8 percent (based on new case data over the past two weeks), the district is likely to see between 25,000 to 30,000 cases by the end of the month, indicating that the district’s doubling rate may shrink further in coming weeks. A senior Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme(IDSP) official in Panchkula, who was not authorised to speak to the media, confirmed that this might indeed be the case.“Authorities should work in anticipation of this surge. A shrinking doubling-rate may also imply that previous containment and contact tracing measures have been inadequate, if not ineffective,” said Dr Prabhakan Dorairaj, vice president (research and policy) at the Public Health Foundation of India.Sonal Goel, additional chief executive officer (additional CEO), Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority(GMDA), and nodal officer for managing hospital beds and ventilators, did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.However, a district health official confirmed the availability of 4,000 beds and 350 ventilators across public and private hospitals, and revealed that at least a 1,000 more beds are being arranged. “Even if we do get 30,000 cases by end of the month, we will be able to treat those who need attention,” the IDSP official said.Experts warned, however, that the doubling rate metric on its own should not be taken as an indicator of the severity of the outbreak. “Each state is working with its own strategy, and dealing with differing population sizes. One cannot say that Gurugram is facing a more severe outbreak than Mumbai just because its doubling rate is faster. But, given the shrinkage in Gurugram’s doubling rate, one can say that transmission of the virus has not been curbed,” said Dr Lalit Kant, an independent public health consultant and former head of the Indian Council of Medical Research’s epidemiology division.Haryana, meanwhile, had a doubling rate of 8 days, with a daily growth rate of 7.1%, as of the morning of June 11. This is the highest in the country, followed by Karnataka (11 days), Jammu & Kashmir (12 days) and Delhi (13 days). “We have to be more careful about enforcing social distancing, as these states all have a lower daily growth rate than Haryana,” said the senior IDSP official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-doubling-rate-highest-among-20-worst-affected-districts-in-india/story-6vqF3gmCi2JZK8VEKkwUBJ.html

This takes the city’s Covid -19 toll to 19. The new fatalities include the death of a police official and three other people who were declared dead on arrival by hospitals and were later tested to be Covid positive. Gurugram has the second-highest coronavirus fatality in the state, after Faridabad where 22 deaths have been reported so far. In the four days, 14 deaths have been reported in Gurugram. The total count of deaths in Haryana stands at 64.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer(CMO), said, “Six deaths have been reported in the city, out of which three were brought dead and were later tested Covid-19 positive. They were in the age bracket of 60-80 years. A 42-year-old woman, who was admitted in AIIMS Jhajjar, was confirmed positive but her cause of death is yet to be ascertained as the details have not been shared by the hospital.”Yadav also said, “A 60-year-old woman having diabetes succumbed to the infection at Medeor Hospital. Also, a police officer who was undergoing treatment for Covid-19 positive at a private hospital died due to cardiac arrest.”.Gurugram also recorded 191 new Covid-19 cases, taking the total count of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus to 2,737, according to the state health bulletin. Out of the total number of cases, 1,858 are hospitalised while 860 have been discharged so far. As of Thursday, Gurugram’s Covid-19 burden was nearly 51%. Since June 1, the city has reported more than 1,700 cases. The district is currently among the 38 worst-affected districts noticing a surge in Covid-19 cases in the country. According to the state health bulletin, 21 overseas travellers, residents of Haryana brought to India from USA under the Vande Bharat Misssion, have also been tested Covid-19 positive. Out of the 21 travellers, 5 have been discharged while 16 are being treated at different districts of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-reports-6-new-deaths-covid-19-tally-reaches-2-737/story-9JOmWQVGNZgn2oGadqLv9K.html
12-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC panel to assess if hotels can be made Covid-19 facilities||The Delhi high court on Thursday constituted a committee of two doctors who will visit two hotels in the city and give a report on the feasibility of these facilities being used as extended Covid hospitals. The court committee comprises AIIMS director Randeep Guleria and VK Paul, who is a member of Niti Aayog. The committee will visit two hotels in the city that had moved the court challenging the decision of the government to convert them into hospitals for Covid-19 patients.Justice Navin Chawla directed the committee of doctors to submit its report on or before June 14 after the two hotels—CHL Limited and Today Hotels Private Limited — had raised several issues and problems in converting their facilities into hospitals. The court posted the matter for further hearing on June 15.On Thursday, the counsels for the petitioner hotels told the court that it would not be feasible for them to convert their premises into hospitals due to various infrastructural constraints.The lawyers submitted that since the hotels are centrally air-conditioned, which increases the risk of Covid-19 virus, and it would be difficult to now change the use for patients.The hotels, through their counsels, also raised concerns on the fate of the employees, who would not be able to come because of the place being turned into a hospital. Additionally, the employees also do not have the expertise to look after the patients.The counsels also said that patient transportation will be a difficulty since their lifts are not big enough to allow stretchers. They also said that since there was only one exit and entry point, it would be fatal for patients if a fire broke out.However, appearing for the Delhi government, additional solicitor general (ASG) Sanjay Jain, submitted that these apprehensions are unfounded and looking into the grave nature of the situation that has arisen because of the Covid-19 pandemic, certain drastic measures had been taken by the government.He also said that the hotels were being used for quarantine purposes even before the order to take them over was passed. Hence, the hotel authorities should have prepared themselves prior to the order was passed.After hearing the arguments, the court said, “Be that as it may, as the issues raised by the petitioners would also have a bearing on whether it is advisable/feasible to use these hotels as Covid hospitals and may not lead to an adverse impact on the patients or the staff working therein, I deem it proper to constitute a committee of doctors, with a request to visit these two hotels and give a report on the advisability/feasibility of these hotels being used as extended Covid hospitals.”“I request Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS and Dr VK Paul, member of the Niti Aayog, to visit the two hotels in question and give their report on advisability/feasibility of using them as extended Covid hospitals”.Advocate Sugam Seth, appearing for CHL Limited said that since the matter is sub-judice, he would not comment on the order. The counsel for Today Hotels Private Limited, advocate Rahul Sharma, also said the matter is pending adjudication and hence he would refrain from making any comments.Dr Guleria confirmed to HT that he has received a mail informing him about the development. Dr VK Paul did not respond to requests for a comment .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-committee-to-study-feasibility-of-using-hotels-as-covid-hospitals/story-mzXGEZb9uwt27Ps1gkDEoO.html
12-06-2020||Delhi||HC tells Delhi govt to allow equipped private hospitals to test for Covid-19||The Delhi High Court on Thursday directed that all private hospitals that have been asked to reserve 20% beds for admitting Covid-19 patients should conduct tests on symptomatic and asymptomatic persons, who seek admission in the hospital for undergoing surgeries and procedures of other nature as well, saying that the city is “fast heading towards becoming the Corona capital of the country, an epithet the city can well do without”.A bench of justice Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad said it was the need of the hour that all private hospitals which are equipped with labs to conduct coronavirus tests and have the sanction of ICMR to do so should be permitted to conduct tests.Also read: Seven states see rapid increase in Covid-19 cases in 10 daysThe high court also noted that non-Covid patients, who are approaching private hospitals for admission to undergo emergency surgeries and other such procedures, are not being admitted before getting a coronavirus test done, for which they are compelled to go elsewhere.“It is most unfortunate that non-Covid patients are being made to wait to undergo a test for Covid-19 at labs other than those which are situated within the premises of the hospitals, that is equipped and authorised to conduct the said test,” the bench said.“In view of the aforesaid situation brought to our attention, it is directed that all the private hospitals in Delhi that have been called upon to reserve 20% beds for admitting COVID-19 patients are equipped with labs to conduct the COVID-19 test and have the sanction of the ICMR to do so, should proceed to conduct tests on symptomatic/asymptomatic persons, who seek admission in the hospital for undergoing surgeries/procedures of other nature as well,” it added.The order came on the application by advocate Sanjeev Sharma who contended that there have been several instances where non-Covid patients needing surgery or other procedures were asked to undergo testing before that, but the hospital concerned did not conduct the Covid test since they don’t have the government permission. The application, filed through advocate Rakesh Malhotra, has also sought a direction to the Delhi government and all the hospitals and nursing homes permitted to treat Covid-19 cases to daily publish on their respective websites the status of vacancy of beds so that patients need not run from pillar to post for the same.Appearing for the Delhi government, its additional standing counsel Satyakam filed a status report stating that currently, there are 17 labs in the public sector and their current combined capacity for undertaking Covid-19 tests is 2,900 samples per day. In the private sector, 23 labs have been permitted to conduct the test and their combined capacity of testing is 5,700 samples per day.However, the counsel for the petitioner said that the status report is also incorrect as the Delhi government has not allowed about six laboratories from taking up Covid-19 tests. However, the Delhi government counsel disputed this submission stating that the details furnished in the status report have been collated only last night and they are correct.Also read| Use mobile data to keep tabs on home quarantine patients: GovtFollowing this, the court issued notice to all the 23 private laboratories who are testing samples to file affidavits clarifying whether they have been permitted to undertake tests for suspected Covid-19 patients by adopting the RT-PCR test or the CB-NAAT test.“They shall also point out the difficulties, if any, faced by them on account of any bureaucratic red tape,” the court added.

The SOP applies to both private and government offices.On May 18, the Delhi government had issued an order allowing private and government offices in the city to function with the physical presence of full working strength but directed them to follow a set of rules concerning social distancing and other measures related to safety and hygiene. It also asked the organisations to allow working from home, if possible.The SOP issued by the Delhi government conforms entirely to the guidelines issued by the union health ministry on June 4, shows the document which HT has seen.The guidelines direct offices to ensure employees above the age of 65, pregnant or those with co-morbidities are not required to mark physical presence, arrangements are made to enable frequent hand washing, premises are sanitised periodically and supervisory officials are appointed to record regular health check of each employee.The Delhi government order makes screening of all employees mandatory and only asymptomatic individuals to be given access to the office premises, meeting to be done through video conference facility as much as possible, ensure adequate gap (at least 6 feet) in the seating arrangement, restricting the number of people in elevators, management of crowd in parking lots and canteens and maintaining the centralised air conditioning between 24-30 degree Celsius and relative humidity between 40%-70%. The offices should ensure a system for proper disposal of the gloves and face masks.The order said, for up to two cases recorded, the particular areas frequented by the concerned individuals will be sanitised. In case of an outbreak (three or higher cases), the entire building has to be closed for at least 48 hours and sanitised. For each suspected case, the document said, it is the role of the supervisory officer to inform the district surveillance teams of the government or call the 1075 helpline and initiate an assessment of “exposure history” to help medical officials trace contacts and seal the appropriate portions of the building premises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-issues-sops-for-all-offices/story-AUZcbsm2v1xdut3iGKL2NL.html
12-06-2020||Delhi||Jama Masjid to close doors again, this time till June 30||Old Delhi’s Jama Masjid will be shut till June 30 amid fears over the spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi, the mosque’s Shahi Imam Syed Ahmed Bukhari declared on Thursday evening. The iconic mosque had only reopened on Monday, after being shut for over two months due to the nationwide lockdown.Bukhari had sought public opinion on the matter on Tuesday after his personal assistant, Amanullah, died of Covid-19 in Safdarjung Hospital.“After taking public opinion and consulting scholars, it has been decided that from Maghreb (sunset) today till June 30, no congregational prayers will be performed in Jama Masjid…Only the staff inside the complex will offer five times namaz while the general public is requested to pray at home. The decision taken is just a precautionary measure,” Bukhari said in a statement.He has also appealed to the heads of other mosques across the country to take a decision regarding the matter depending on their local situation.The administrations of some mosques in the city said they were considering whether or not they would stay partially open, or shut completely. Others, however, have decided to follow in Jama Masjid’s footsteps and stay shut till June 30. Mufti Mukarram Ahmed, the Shahi Imam of Fatehpuri Masjid in Chandni Chowk, said, “We have been holding consultations with the imams associations in the city. Jama Masjid has a proper boundary and can be kept closed easily. But this is not the case with other mosques. We are planning to keep the mosque partially open and allow only a few who do not have any other place to go to offer the daily prayers. A decision is yet to be taken.”He added that they will request locals to pray at home like they used to do during the lockdown.Maulana Mohd Suleiman of Khajur Wali Masjid in Daryaganj, said, “We have eight or 10 small mosques around Daryaganj. Most have agreed to stay shut till June 30 following the Shahi Imam’s decision. We have a meeting with others to request them to join us in this fight against the virus.” Similarly, Hafiz Mohammad Javed, president, Purani Masjid Panchsheel Enclave, Chirag Dilli, said they have been making regular announcements and circulating messages on social media requesting people to pray at home. “We have decided to remain shut till June-end. We are asking people to think of their homes as places of worship and stay safe,” Javed said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jama-masjid-to-close-doors-again-this-time-till-june-30/story-sAaRIsGnpU6f8JZ1dvNkYJ.html

Singhvi said, “The health atrocities are a fundamental assault on human rights and we are very happy that the NHRC has taken this up….The common man are suffering because of the political blame game, bickering and misgovernance or non-governance of the duo AAP-BJP,” he said.In an online press conference, addressed by Singhvi and Delhi Congress chief Anil Chaudhary, Singhvi hit out at the Delhi government while referring to the number of containment zones in the national capital.Singhvi said when the number of positive cases was 3,000 plus, there were 102 containment zones and now when the number of Covid-19 cases have crossed 30,000, there are 285 containment zones. He said thousands of people were running from pillar to post in search of beds and struggling to even get a Covid-19 test done.“Despite having the largest number of hospitals and the most advanced healthcare facilities in India, these two mismanaging musketeers have cost Delhi dear, both in precious lives and the exponential and unceasing rise of the virus. Thousands of people are running from pillar to post in search of beds and fighting tooth and nail to even get a Covid test,” he added.The Congress claimed the Delhi government had reduced testing. “It is astonishing that instead of progressing, it is regressing as far as testing is concerned,” he saidChaudhary said, “Neither was the AAP government able to send labourers safely, nor were they able to make health arrangements in hospitals in Delhi. Kejriwal is misleading the people of Delhi.”AAP did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-aap-making-people-of-delhi-suffer-cong/story-cqT3RX86Qm6RV87drI8hiJ.html

12-06-2020||Pune||Pune to redraw micro-containment zones, allow non-essential stores to open by June 15||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has assured to redraw the Covid-19 containment zone map and add micro-level areas to allow resumption of commercial activities in central parts of the city as per the demands made by the Pune traders’ association.At a meeting held by Sugar commissioner Saurabh Rao, who is given the additional responsibility of managing containment areas in Pune, and additional municipal commissioner Shantanu Goyal with traders on Wednesday, Rao said that the new containment zone map will be released by June 15.“As per central government’s instructions, once the containment zone is announced, the local authorities cannot make changes in it for 14 days. The containment zone announcement’s cycle will be ready by June 15. The administration is taking steps to declare more micro containment zones that will allow businesses to resume in the central parts of the city,” said Rao.Pune currently has 65 containment zones, with restrictions imposed in areas like Raviwar peth, Bhavani peth, Nana peth and Ganesh peth known for wholesale businesses, including furniture, jewellery, toys, electronics, automobile and cloth market. These areas have 6,000 business establishments employing at least one lakh workers, according to Pune traders’ association.The traders’ body told the authorities said that shutters of shops in central parts of the city has been down for 85 days. They demanded reopening of businesses and assured to follow precautions related to Covid-19 spread.Fattechand Ranka, president, Pune Trade Association, said, “We have cooperated with the government and administration till date. If the authorities keep business areas under restriction zones in the redrawing of the containment map on June 15, it would be difficult for us to sustain. The traders’ union may also boycott meetings with the authorities after June15, if the decisions taken by the latter is against our interests.”The Pune civic body earlier last week had permitted Tulshibaug and Mandai areas to resume operations with restrictions of restarting business establishments on odd-even days and between 9am to 7pm. PMC health chief Ramchandra Hankare said, “The containment policy is framed by the central and state governments which is getting executed by PMC. As a medical expert, it is true that if people movement is increased in containment zones, there are chances of more positive cases being reported. The decision on containment zones is taken by the municipal commissioner in consultation from the police. It is being planned to follow the Mumbai model by adding more micro containment zones only for small pockets or specific buildings, but a decision is not yet taken.”Vicky Khanna, a resident of peth area, said, “Despite lockdown and containment zones, Covid-19 cases are increasing. People belonging to low income group are severely affected. It would be better if only selected buildings or pockets are sealed instead of containing large areas.”Avinash Sakat of Bhavani peth area said, “People are on the streets to purchase essential commodities. It is true that there is fear that if businesses restart, more people would be on roads and chances of more positive cases being reported, but for how many days will be asked to stay at homes? We will have to learn to live with it.”Pune city’s Covid case tally on Wednesday reached 8,509 of which around 50 per cent have been reported from the central parts of the city, according to the PMC health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-traders-demand-reopening-of-shops-by-redrawing-micro-level-zones/story-zmHoNiFQBTeZPjUsH1O1AK.html

12-06-2020||World||Covid-19 pandemic: US to issue 96 million free face masks to plane, train passengers||The US government plans to distribute 96 million cloth face coverings for free to people riding on planes, trains and public transportation systems.The Transportation Department said Friday it will provide 86.8 million masks to airports and 9.6 million to 458 transit agencies and Amtrak.“This Administration is committed to protecting our people and reopening the economy,” Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said in a press release. “Distributing these facial coverings will help boost public confidence as we begin to resume our normal lives.”Airline and transit operations have seen dramatic reductions in use by the public in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. People are beginning to return to travel, but the levels are still far below a year ago.On Thursday, 502,209 people went through Transportation Security Administration airport screening, the most since March 21, according to the agency. That represents about 19% of the equivalent day a year ago.Most airlines and transit systems already require masks, though enforcement has been spotty.The Transportation Department is working with the Health and Human Services Department, it said in a press release. The cloth coverings were obtained by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and will be distributed in the coming weeks.Travelers are “still responsible for having their own facial covering” in situations in which it is required, the DOT said. The government’s supply is intended to be supplemental and availability is not guaranteed.Workers in the transportation sector have been vulnerable to the disease. The Transportation Security Administration said 667 of its employees have tested positive for Covid-19, including five who have died.Because airlines and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention haven’t agreed on a system to trace passengers who have flown with ill people, it’s not clear how many have been infected by air travel.A second wave of infections by the novel coronavirus appears underway in the US The case load is slowly growing nationally, while it rages in local hot spots, with wide differences in infection rates even within states.Texas, California, Florida and Alabama all are among states where infections and hospitalizations are hitting new highs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-us-to-issue-96-million-free-face-masks-to-plane-train-passengers/story-84arRfWzgrcPk0CreEwalL.html
12-06-2020||World||Won’t be silenced: Priti Patel as UK opposition MPs accuse her of ‘gaslighting’ racism||UK Home Secretary Priti Patel has taken a defiant stand and said she will not be “silenced” by the Opposition Labour Party MPs who accused her of using her Indian heritage to “gaslight” the “very real racism” faced by communities in Britain.The Indian-origin Cabinet minister had referenced her personal experience of racist abuse while growing up as an ethnic minority in the UK during an impassioned statement in the House of Commons earlier this week. A group of 12 ethnic minority Labour MPs, including Indian-origin MPs Virendra Sharma, Tan Dhesi, Preet Kaur Gill, Valerie Vaz, Seema Malhotra and Nadia Whittome, wrote to her on Thursday to say that “being a person of colour does not automatically make you an authority on all forms of racism”. “We write to you as Black Asian and Ethnic Minority Labour MPs to highlight our dismay at the way you used your heritage and experiences of racism to gaslight the very real racism faced by Black people and communities across the UK,” the MPs write. Gaslighting refers to a form of psychological manipulation where seeds of doubt are planted against a particular idea. Patel responded by making the letter public on Twitter, with the message: “I will not be silenced by @UKLabour MPs who continue to dismiss the contributions of those who don’t conform to their view of how ethnic minorities should behave.” Addressing the House of Commons on Monday, a day after violent clashes between Black Lives Matter protesters and police officers, Patel had condemned the violence perpetrated by a minority of protesters who would face justice.Questioned by an Opposition Labour Party MP on whether the minister fully understood the “anger and frustration” felt by anti-racism demonstrators protesting against the brutal killing of African-American George Floyd in police custody in the US, Patel retaliated with references to her own experiences. The minister, born to Gujarati-origin parents who fled Uganda for the UK when dictator Idi Amin expelled Asians from the African country in the early 1970s, said: “On that basis, it must have been a very different Home Secretary who as a child was frequently called a Paki in the playground; a very different Home Secretary who was racially abused in the streets or even advised to drop her surname and use her husband’s in order to advance her career… so when it comes to racism, sexism, tolerance or social justice, I will not take lectures from the those other side of the House.” In their complaint letter, the group of 12 Labour MPs demand that Patel “reflect” on her words and the impact it had towards black communities in the UK.“Structures of racism, hatred and equality have many layers and therefore, whilst it is true, there are some experiences of racism that we all face, there are also some experiences of racism that we all do not face,” reads the letter. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock spoke out in support of his Cabinet colleague when asked about the row during the daily Downing Street briefing on Thursday evening. “I abhor this divisive identity politics that’s being levelled at Priti Patel. I’m incredibly proud to be part of the most diverse government in history. We don’t think that there’s such a thing as the wrong type of BME [black and minority ethnic]. We think that people are equal,” he said. Fellow Indian-origin Cabinet colleague Alok Sharma also extended his support via Twitter, to say: “I stand with Priti”. Pakistani-origin Conservative Party colleague and former UK Chancellor and Home Secretary Sajid Javid also spoke out in her favour as he branded the Labour Party’s letter “utterly misguided and irresponsible”. “Imagine listening to an ethnic-minority woman’s history of suffering racist abuse – and then deciding that you’d rather condemn the victim than her abusers. All because she doesn’t fit your stereotype,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/won-t-be-silenced-priti-patel-as-uk-opposition-mps-accuse-her-of-gaslighting-racism/story-NOH5S0NlMRSDlTlZrIQx3K.html
12-06-2020||World||French researcher wins access to ex-president’s 1994 Rwanda genocide files||A French researcher won an extended legal battle Friday for access to ex-president Francois Mitterrand’s archives on the 1994 Rwandan genocide, in which Kigali accuses France of having played a role.France’s top administrative court, the State Council, ruled the documents would allow researcher and author Francois Graner “to shed light on a debate that is a matter of public interest”.The documents include notes written by the president’s advisers and minutes of government meetings.The ruling is the latest chapter in a long dispute between France and Rwanda in the aftermath of the genocide in which some 800,000 people, mainly minority Tutsis but also moderate Hutus, were slaughtered in 100 days of ethnic violence committed mainly by Hutu extremists.Ahead of the genocide’s 20th anniversary in 2014, Rwandan President Paul Kagame accused Paris of having played a “direct role” in the assassination of then-president Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, which sparked the bloodbath.The Tutsi leader said France took part in Habyarimana’s “execution”, some say in a move to stoke anti-Tutsi sentiment.In November 2016, Kigali launched an inquiry into the alleged role of 20 French officials in the genocide.- ‘Victory’ for history -France has always denied the allegations and last year, President Emmanuel Macron announced the creation of a panel of historians and researchers to look into the claims.Graner, who has published widely on the genocide, first requested access to Mitterrand’s documents in 2015, the year the government under then-president Francois Hollande declassified archives on Rwanda for the period 1990-95.But the researcher’s request was refused, prompting him to file legal challenges that have failed until to now with courts upholding a law protecting presidential archives for 25 years after a leader’s death. In the case of Mitterrand, who died in 1996, they would become available in 2021.“Protection of state secrets must be balanced against the interests of informing the public about historic events,” the State Council ruled.“This is a victory for the law, but also for history,” Graner’s lawyer Patrice Spinosi told AFP.“Researchers like Mr Graner will be able to access president Mitterrand’s archives in order to fully understand France’s role in Rwanda in 1994 and 1995,” he said.- ‘Serious errors of judgement’ -Graner belongs to rights group Survie (“Survival”), which has vowed to “shed light on France’s involvement in Rwanda before and during the genocide.”Franco-Rwandan relations hit a low point in 2006 after a French judge recommended Kagame be prosecuted by a UN-backed tribunal over the 1994 killing of Habyarimana.The Rwandan President, who had led the Tutsi rebel force that eventually overthrew the genocidal Hutu regime, broke off ties with France for three years.The turning point came in 2010 when former president Nicolas Sarkozy acknowledged on a visit to Kigali that France had made “serious errors of judgement” in Rwanda.While falling short of an apology it was seen as a breakthrough in Rwanda.But France’s perceived foot-dragging on bringing genocide suspects living in the country to justice, has aggravated tensions.On May 16, the genocide’s alleged financier, Felicien Kabuga, was arrested at his home outside Paris after a quarter-of-a-century on the run.On June 3, a Paris court approved his transfer to a UN body for trial in Arusha, Tanzania.French-Rwandan former hotel driver Claude Muhayimana is set to go on trial in Paris in February next year, accused of having transported Hutu militiamen to sites where massacres were carried out.In the two other Rwandan genocide trials concluded in France, a former officer in the presidential guard, Pascal Simbikangwa, was given a 25-year sentence in 2014, while Octavien Ngenzi and Tito Barahira, two former mayors, received life sentences in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-researcher-wins-access-to-ex-president-s-1994-rwanda-genocide-files/story-HbrNpWAFDECDPRtCwhvkoK.html

The Express Tribune reported that the Islamabad Police said that after evaluation, it was found that the case needed to be investigated by the FIA.However, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Islamabad President Shakeel Abbasi already approached the FIA with a complaint against Ritchie for making a slanderous tweet against Bhutto but it refused to take action.The FIA on June 9 told an Islamabad sessions court to dismiss a plea against Ritchie as the petitioner, Shakeel Abbasi, was not an affected party.Ritchie alleged that Benazir condoned rape culture.The FIA, in its written response to the court, argued that according to its rules, only the aggrieved party — the targeted victim or their guardian — could lodge such a complaint with the agency.However, Additional Sessions Judge Atta Rabbani issued a notice to Ritchie seeking her response by June 13.Meanwhile, the fight between Ritchie and the PPP leaders turned nasty after her objectionable tweets and subsequent allegations against top leaders of PPP, including former Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani.On June 10, the former prime minister sent a legal notice to Cynthia, seeking Rs100 million in damages and an apology.Separately, former interior minister Rehman Malik also said he will serve Ritchie a legal notice after she accused that he raped her in 2011.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-police-refuse-to-file-case-against-us-blogger-for-tweet-against-benazir-bhutto/story-IcpztZSwfj9r2ZV5a3GLcJ.html

Rallies are planned for Australian cities this weekend over the Minnesota death of George Floyd; the coronavirus risk posed to asylum-seekers held in crowded Australian immigration detention centers; and the pandemic threat created by eating meat. Police largely did not enforce social distancing rules during peaceful Black Lives Matter rallies attended by thousands in Australian cities last weekend that focused on the high incarceration rate of indigenous Australians. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison has urged police to charge protesters with breaching pandemic restrictions during the coming weekend. “The very clear message is that people should not attend those events, because it is against the health advice to do so,” Morrison told reporters. A large police presence gathered in Sydney around the site of a proposed Black Lives Matter rally hours ahead of its scheduled start in an apparent attempt to deter the public gathering. Finance Minister Mathias Cormann suggested demonstrators could lose government welfare payments if they attended rallies, but Morrison later ruled out any such federal retaliation. The government pays a wage subsidy to 3.5 million Australians to keep them in work during the pandemic lockdown. A protester became sick after attending a Melbourne rally on Saturday and later tested positive for COVID-19. Authorities suspected he became infected before the rally and might have spread the virus to other protesters. A court on Thursday ruled a refugee rally planned for Sydney on Saturday illegal because of the pandemic threat, increasing the range of powers available to police to prevent it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-australian-government-urges-protesters-not-to-attend-black-lives-matter-rallies/story-DKHpjjOjRgommf2o0aS1iO.html
12-06-2020||World||Syria economic meltdown presents new challenge for Assad||In scenes not witnessed for years in government-controlled parts of Syria, dozens of men and women marched through the streets this week, protesting a sharp increase in prices and collapse of the currency, some even calling for the downfall of President Bashar Assad and his ruling Baath party.“He who starves his people is a traitor,” some of the protesters chanted at the protest in the southern city of Sweida.In Syria nowadays, there is an impending fear that all doors are closing. After nearly a decade of war, the country is crumbling under the weight of years-long Western sanctions, government corruption and infighting, a pandemic and an economic downslide made worse by the financial crisis in Lebanon, Syria’s main link with the outside world.Syria faces near complete isolation as the toughest US sanctions yet start to come into effect next week. While Assad may have won the military war against his opponents with the help of allies Russia and Iran, he now faces an even bigger challenge of governing while more than 80% of his people live in poverty.In government-held areas, prices go up several times a day, forcing many shops to close, unable to keep up with the chaos. This week the Syrian currency dropped to a record 3,500 pounds to the dollar on the black market — compared to 700 at the beginning of the year. Some staples such as sugar, rice and medicine are becoming hard to find.“The Syrian economy has spiraled out of control and the regime cannot control the Syrian pound anymore,” said Osama Kadi, a Canada-based Syrian economic adviser.The pain is likely to grow under the new US sanctions, which Washington says aim to punish Assad and his top lieutenants for crimes committed during the country’s conflict.Effectively, the sanctions prevent anyone around the world from doing business with Syrian officials or state institutions or participate in the war-ravaged country’s reconstruction. They also target anyone involved in smuggling to Syria, mostly from Iraq and Lebanon.The US has already imposed sanctions on Assad and a number of his top officials. The new authority, known as the US Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, allows foreign companies to be targeted, including in neighbouring Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq.“This legislation will close all the doors on the Syrian regime and any person that deals with it,” said Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese citizen who is a member of the Caesar Act team, a group that advises US authorities on implementing the sanctions.The first wave of sanctions will be imposed on June 17. Three other stages will follow before the end of August, he said.Caesar is the code name of a Syrian forensic photographer who graphically exposed the brutality of the government crackdown by smuggling out thousands of photos of torture victims.Experts say the new sanctions will be a heavy blow to a country where eight out of 10 people make less than $100 a month, according to the United Nations. The Syrian government called the sanctions “economic terrorism.”Some of the repercussions have already been profound.Bread prices increased nearly 60% in the rebel-held northwestern province of Idlib, even though the territory with a population of over 3 million is not included in the new sanctions. Its population, many of them unemployed and living in displaced camps, have also been hit hard by the collapse of the pound, since it is the main currency used in Idlib.As a result, protests erupted this week calling for the ouster of the “Salvation Government” administering Idlib, led by al-Qaida-linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.The Syrian pound — which had been at 47 to the dollar at the start of the conflict — had held steady at around 500 to the dollar from 2014 until last year.It started crumbling from a number of factors: the coronavirus lockdown, Lebanon’s financial crisis, new rules requiring use of the Syrian pound and a feud between Assad and his cousin Rami Makhlouf, one of Syria’s richest men.The Syrian government has lost major income from resources in areas outside its control, including oil fields in the east held by US-backed fighters and farmlands that produced much of the country’s wheat.Most damaging, perhaps, has been the financial turmoil in Lebanon. Banks there have served as a gateway to the world for Syrian businessmen, officials and average people. Now Lebanon’s tight capital controls lock away billions of dollars in their accounts.“Lebanon was not only Syria’s economic get-out-of-jail card, but it is the beating heart of Syria’s business community,” Danny Makki, a Britain-based Syrian journalist and political analyst, wrote recently for the Middle East Institute.Lebanon is also panicking about losing Syria, particularly the electricity it still buys from the war-torn country. In recent weeks, the Lebanese army has begun closing some smuggling routes to and from Syria where fuel, diesel, medicine and other goods flow.Syria and its allies say the Caesar Act aims at starving the Syrian people. The US Embassy in Syria — closed since the beginning of the conflict — tweeted on Sunday: “The regime’s destructive war has crushed the Syrian economy, not US or EU sanctions.”Amid the turmoil, Assad fired Prime Minister Imad Khamis on Wednesday in a move that appeared aimed at deflecting public anger. Khamis told parliament this week that the government was discussing with allies ways to boost the pound’s value. He said the government was also taking steps to avoid any shortage of pharmaceuticals.Samer Aftimos, a pharmacist in Damascus, said shortages are already taking place, in part because of people hoarding medicine. Drug companies have stopped supplying some medicines, he said.Syrian legislator Muhannad Haj Ali, who has been under European and American sanctions for years, said Syria survived past economic crises and will overcome the Caesar Act.“What the terrorists and the Americans couldn’t take on the battlefield, where we paid with our blood and wounds, they won’t be able to gain politically, no matter how much pressure they exert,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syria-economic-meltdown-presents-new-challenge-for-assad/story-t1KTav51zYwEgndJkKsUgJ.html
12-06-2020||World||Germany pushes for speedy stimulus rollout as economy stumbles||Germany pressed ahead with the implementation of a 130 billion-euro ($145 billion) stimulus package, as Europe’s largest economy seeks a way out of the worst recession since World War II.At a special meeting on Friday, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cabinet signed off on numerous key initiatives agreed on by her ruling coalition last week. The goal is to get the bulk of the plan approved by parliament before its summer break, which typically begins a two-month recess in early July.With exports tumbling and unemployment surging from the fallout of lockdowns to contain the coronavirus pandemic, the government is under pressure to act. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said Friday that figures for May could be as bad as April, when industrial production took a record hit. A recovery is only expected starting in July, he added.“Despite the gradual easing, the slump in sales in many industries is far longer than expected weeks ago,” Eric Schweitzer, president of the DIHK business lobby, said in a statement. “The water is already up to the neck” of companies in hard-hit sectors such as travel and trade fairs.A value-added tax cut designed to reinvigorate demand after weeks of curbs on public life is set to go into effect on July 1. Other measures the cabinet approved include emergency aid for small and mid-sized companies, a family bonus of 300 euros per child and changes to tax rules to changes to tax rules to encourage people to buy less-polluting vehicles.“Our measures have punch,” Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said in a press conference following the cabinet meeting. “We want to come out of this crisis with full strength.”To pay for the massive stimulus package, the government intends to increase borrowing this year by at least 30 billion euros, people familiar with the plan have said.A supplement to the 2020 budget to pave the way for the borrowing will be decided next week, Scholz said, declining to comment on the size. The move also requires parliamentary approval.After years of budget surpluses and restrained spending, Germany has reduced debt from over 80% of gross domestic product in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to around 60%, giving it room for extra borrowing, according to Scholz.Germans broadly back the latest stimulus package, according to a survey published Friday. Among 1,270 voters polled for broadcaster ZDF, 68% said they think the measures are positive and half think the right amount is being spent. However, 85% said they don’t believe that the sales-tax reduction will do much to lift the economy.Even if the stimulus package were implemented in full, the economy is projected to shrink by 8.1% this year, according to the Berlin-based DIW institute. That’s worse than the Bundesbank’s prediction of -7.1% and the OECD’s -6.6%. Altmaier said there was no reason to update official government forecasts for now.While Germany has kept the coronavirus in check in recent weeks, a second wave of infections is unavoidable, according to Lars Feld, the country’s top economic adviser.“The goal is to avoid a lockdown during a second wave,” Feld said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “Then we perhaps don’t even need a second or a third package of fiscal stimulus.”Recent figures suggest that there’s a pick up in the economy from the low in April, “so it very much looks like we can realize a V-shaped scenario and then avoiding a second leg lockdown will be sufficient,” he added.That might be too late for some companies. Auto suppliers have been particularly hard hit by the collapse in demand and have fewer resources than carmakers to weather a prolonged downturn.”Our industry has suffered a cardiac arrest in Europe,” Elmar Degenhart, chief executive officer of German auto-parts giant Continental AG, told news agency DPA in an interview. “Such a cardiac arrest cannot be remedied with a high dose of vitamin C - what is needed is a defibrillator.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-pushes-for-speedy-stimulus-rollout-as-economy-stumbles/story-Z3uO8PcHzkHLFmsLJsnUEJ.html
12-06-2020||World||Chinese users saw Zoom as a window through the ‘Great Firewall’||Zoom Video Communications has gained a following in China in recent months from users ranging from underground churches to feminists who saw it as a rare way to connect with the world beyond the reach of state censors.Some fear that window may be closing.On Friday, Zoom said it had suspended accounts of three US and Hong Kong activists at Beijing’s request after they tried to commemorate the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, but that they had since been reactivated. The US company also said it was developing technology to enable it to remove or block participants based on geography.The Chinese government heavily regulates the internet, in a system widely dubbed the Great Firewall, saying this is needed to maintain social stability. All Chinese social media platforms are required to censor public posts deemed illegal.“For us, the biggest challenge has been how to reach people within China because of the firewall, and Zoom for a while looked like a ray of hope,” said US-based Humanitarian China founder Zhou Fengsuo, whose account was suspended.The conferencing tool, originally designed for business use, saw Chinese user numbers surge in tandem with its global popularity amid the Covid-19 pandemic, a rare feat given how Western peers such as WhatsApp, Google Meet and Facebook are blocked in China’s cyberspace. Zoom’s mobile app has been downloaded 5.4 million times from Apple’s China store since Jan. 1, 11 times the number over the same period in 2019, according to research firm SensorTower.While most Chinese users turn to Zoom for conference calls and casual chats, some have seized the chance to discuss potentially sensitive topics, from patriotism to feminism.Some state-approved and underground churches use Zoom to hold services.“Zoom is not the only software, but we feel it’s rather more accessible,” said Xiao Meili, a feminist activist who held a Zoom talk in April on the #MeToo movement. “Before, some friends recommended Tencent conference ... but everyone would feel like you shouldn’t say anything that’s slightly sensitive,” she said, referring to a tool offered by the Chinese tech giant behind WeChat. Inside the firewallIn March, Youth Lectures kicked off a series of Zoom talks, the first of which was led by Chinese University of Hong Kong professor Chow Po Chung, on freedom of speech in China. Chow’s mainland China account on the Twitter-like platform Weibo has been deleted multiple times. Other anonymous groups hosted lectures from a #MeToo activist and a gender-activist on their work in mid-May.New York-based Lu Pin, whose influential Feminist Voices accounts on Weibo and WeChat were shut by authorities in 2018, said Zoom was a way to connect a Chinese audience to the outside world.“You don’t have to climb the firewall, people in China and outside of China both can connect to it,” she said.There are few alternatives, she said.“This is not a multiple-choice question. If you’re a Chinese person, if you don’t use this, what will you use?”Zoom’s China users had already been subject to new constraints since last month when the company announced that free users would no longer be able host meetings, and new registrations were limited to some enterprises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-users-saw-zoom-as-a-window-through-the-great-firewall/story-rahZKcx1pTkf0msuMkFGbJ.html
12-06-2020||World||Vast amounts of Venezuelan oil are hidden en route to China, bypassing US sanctions: Data, documents||Last year, China replaced the United States as the No. 1 importer of oil from Venezuela, yet another front in the heated rivalry between Washington and Beijing. The United States had imposed sanctions on Venezuela’s state-owned oil company as part of a bid to topple that country’s socialist president, Nicolas Maduro. US refineries stopped buying Venezuelan crude. Caracas’ ally China, long a major customer, suddenly found itself the top purchaser. Through the first six months of 2019, it imported an average of 350,000 barrels per day of crude from Venezuela.But in August, Washington tightened its sanctions on Venezuela, warning that any foreign entity that continued to do business with the South American country’s government could find itself subject to sanctions. State-owned China National Petroleum Corp, known as CNPC, stopped loading oil at Venezuelan ports that month. China’s import data showed purchases started to slow, and by late 2019, abruptly stopped.China’s largest oil company, like customers in some other countries, seemed to be knuckling under to US President Donald Trump’s threats, despite Chinese President Xi Jinping’s professed support for Maduro.But China never stopped buying. Crude from Petroleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA, kept arriving at Chinese ports with the help of a Switzerland-based unit of Rosneft, Russia’s state-owned oil company, and a roundabout delivery method that made it appear as if the oil’s origin was Malaysia, Reuters has found. Between July 1 and Dec. 31, tanker ships delivered at least 18 shipments totaling 19.7 million barrels of rebranded Venezuelan crude to Chinese ports, Reuters determined. That finding is based on a review of ship-tracking data, internal PDVSA documents and interviews with four petroleum analysts who have tracked flows of Venezuelan oil around the globe.A unit of CNPC chartered at least one of those tankers, meaning it was responsible for the oil aboard, the ship-tracking data show. That vessel, called the Adventure, took on Venezuelan crude on July 18 and discharged it in China on Sept. 4, the data show. No charter information was available for the other ships that offloaded crude in China.CNPC did not respond to requests for comment.Those 18 shipments represented more than 5% of Venezuela’s total exports in 2019, worth around $1 billion at market prices for the country’s flagship crude grade, known as Merey, based on OPEC figures. The sales provided much-needed support to Maduro’s government, though Reuters could not determine how much was added to state coffers; PDVSA often sells its crude at steep discounts, and some of its sales go to pay down debt rather than generate cash.The mislabeled shipments have continued into this year, Reuters found. The review used data available on financial information provider Refinitiv Eikon, photos culled from satellite imagery and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data transmitted by oil tankers. New York-based Refinitiv is part-owned by Reuters’ parent company, Thomson Reuters.The shipping method - involving the transfer of oil between tanker ships at sea – has for months been under scrutiny by the Trump administration. Washington in February slapped sanctions on Rosneft Trading SA, the Geneva-based subsidiary of Rosneft, which it alleges was helping Venezuela to export its oil using so-called ship-to-ship (STS) transfers to mask the true origin of the crude. Rosneft denied wrongdoing.“The Company has always been conducting and is conducting its business in full compliance with applicable international legislation,” Rosneft said in a June 5 statement in response to questions for this article.Russia’s energy ministry did not reply to a request for comment.China’s indirect imports of Venezuelan crude fall into something of a gray zone, according to Peter Harrell, a sanctions expert at the Center for a New American Security think tank in Washington.Harrell believes US sanctions give Washington authority to punish foreign companies that purchase PDVSA oil through a middleman - particularly if the company “knows or should have known it was Venezuelan crude.” But that does not obligate the US government to act.“At the end of the day, these sanctions are fundamentally policy calls,” Harrell said.Reuters could not independently verify if China knew the oil that reached its shores via Rosneft Trading came from Venezuela.The US Treasury Department, which enforces trade sanctions, declined to comment. Asked about the Reuters findings, Elliott Abrams, the US State Department’s special representative for Venezuela, said in an interview that potential US sanctions against Chinese companies purchasing transshipped crude were “on the table.” “We will be taking individual actions with respect to STS transfers,” Abrams said.China’s General Administration of Customs did not respond to requests for comment. The Foreign Ministry told Reuters there was nothing improper about China’s dealings with Venezuela. The ministry said US sanctions had “severely affected” relations between Venezuela and the rest of the world, but said Beijing intends to continue trading with the country.Neither PDVSA, Venezuela’s Oil Ministry, nor the Information Ministry - which responds to media inquiries on the government’s behalf - responded to requests for comment. Venezuelan officials have repeatedly described US sanctions on their country as illegal and unilateral. Oil analysts since last year have said Venezuelan oil was making its way to China by way of STS transfers. This account is the first to reveal the extent of those shipments and demonstrate how systematic the tactic has been. Reuters also reviewed internal PDVSA documents that showed the Rosneft unit was involved in moving the oil.So much PDVSA oil was shipped to China this way that the country’s total 2019 imports of Venezuelan oil averaged 283,000 barrels a day. That’s 24% higher than the 228,700 barrels a day reported by Chinese customs, according to Reuters calculations based on comparisons of the Refinitiv Eikon data to official Chinese customs data.That was not enough to offset entirely the impact that US sanctions had on PDVSA; US refiners were importing an average of 500,000 barrels per day when the sanctions were imposed in January 2019. But it helped Venezuela keep its oil industry alive at a time when the drop in demand from foreign buyers was creating a glut onshore, nearly forcing PDVSA to halt production in key oil fields.The STS maneuvers mirror tactics that Iran, whose oil industry is also under US sanctions, has used to ship its oil to China for years. As Reuters documented in reports in 2019 and 2015, Iranian oil often is labeled as coming from neighboring Iraq.A representative of the operator of a Chinese terminal where one such shipment unloaded in 2019 denied that the origin of the oil was Iranian.Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for Iran’s mission to the United Nations in New York, said in a statement “how we sell or export our oil is no one’s business.” He said US sanctions on Iran’s oil exports are “illegal.”The Chinese shipments of Venezuelan crude were unusual for a variety of reasons, oil analysts said.STS transfers typically are used for legitimate purposes - such as offloading oil from deep-water drilling ships or pumping oil from large tankers onto smaller vessels that can navigate narrow or shallow waterways. The use of this technique to transport oil from Venezuela to China was not seen until the middle of last year, the oil analysts said.Tankers leaving Venezuela loaded with PDVSA crude did not travel straight to China as they had in the past. Instead, 15 tankers whose routes were reviewed by Reuters left Venezuela and first headed for the coast of Malaysia, tracking data show. A few miles offshore, in the Malacca Strait, each rendezvoused with a second, empty tanker that had pulled alongside. The full tanker then pumped its load into the waiting vessel, and in some cases into multiple smaller vessels. Eighteen of those receiving ships then headed to China, where the Venezuelan crude was offloaded and recorded as a product of Malaysia, Chinese customs records show.Reuters could not ascertain who changed the crude’s labeled origin before it reached Chinese customs, nor whether doing so expressly violated any maritime laws or local laws in any applicable jurisdictions.Michelle Bockmann, markets editor and analyst at Lloyd’s List, a shipping trade publication, said the relabeling was highly uncommon. With the exception of Iran, Bockmann said she could not recall any other instance of crude changing identities in this way.The imports were a break from China’s past practice. China routinely has imported oil from countries such as Brazil and Russia using STS transfers. But Chinese customs accurately recorded the true countries of origin in those cases, according to Chinese customs data and Emma Li, a Singapore-based oil analyst with Refinitiv.In addition, Malaysia is a mid-sized oil producer that has not traditionally sold crude to China in the volumes recorded by Chinese customs last year, the records show. China’s stated 2019 imports from Malaysia were 400% higher than levels recorded just three years earlier, and the highest ever recorded by Refinitiv Eikon, whose figures date to 2006.The Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation, the government agency largely in charge of foreign trade, did not respond to requests for comment, nor did Malaysia’s state-owned oil company Petronas.This triangulated trade in Venezuelan oil is now in the crosshairs of the Trump administration.The company that lifted the oil from Venezuela for the China shipments identified by Reuters was Rosneft Trading, according to internal PDVSA documents reviewed by Reuters. Until late March, it was a major player in Venezuela’s oil industry. The US Treasury on Feb. 18 hit Rosneft Trading with sanctions for allegedly helping Venezuela sidestep the US pressure campaign and sell its oil abroad. Among the tactics employed by Rosneft Trading were STS transfers, US officials allege. By using one ship to haul crude out of Venezuela, then a second to deliver it to China, Rosneft Trading attempted to blur the chain of ownership and disguise the oil’s provenance, Abrams, the State Department’s special representative for Venezuela, told Reuters, without providing further proof of Rosneft’s intentions. “The whole purpose is to evade, the whole purpose is to mislead,” Abrams said.On March 28, Rosneft announced it was ending its Venezuela operations and selling all its assets in the country to another, unnamed Russian state-owned firm.“Rosneft has no ongoing business involvement, assets or operations in Venezuela; therefore, there is no subject for providing further comments,” the company said in its June 5 statement to Reuters. The Trump administration, meanwhile, gave Rosneft Trading customers until May 20 to unwind their contracts with the company or face US sanctions. Asked whether Chinese customers were involved in hiding the Venezuelan origin of the crude, Abrams said that Asian clients often did not care “how it gets to them, what it’s labeled, as long as they’re getting what they bought.”China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement it was not aware of the STS transfers in question. “The cooperation between China and Venezuela will be carried out normally no matter how the situation changes,” the statement read. “It’s legitimate and benefits the people of both countries and will not be affected by any unilateral sanction measures.”Reuters could not ascertain the final customers for the PDVSA crude in China. But Venezuela’s heavy Merey blend is a favored feedstock for refineries making asphalt in China, according to industry sources there. One of the earliest STS transfers involved the Adventure, a tanker chartered by a CNPC subsidiary. On July 18, it took on 1.9 million barrels of Venezuelan crude from another vessel in Malaysian waters, then headed for China, Refinitiv Eikon data show. The manager of the Adventure, Greece-based Eastern Mediterranean Maritime Ltd, said it had never entered into any agreement with PDVSA or any company sanctioned by the United States, and that it “respects and complies in full” with US sanctions. The maritime company said the cargo’s bill of lading and certificate of origin said the oil had come from Malaysia.  Pit stop in MalaysiaMalaysia is a popular location for STS transfers of crude because of its proximity to Singapore, one of the world’s largest oil trading and storage hubs. One of the STS transfers reviewed by Reuters occurred near Malaysia’s port of Kuala Linggi; the rest took place outside the country’s Tanjung Bruas port.To demonstrate how these STS transfers work, Reuters used records available on Refinitiv Eikon to reconstruct a shipment to China of 2 million barrels that left the Jose terminal in northeastern Venezuela on Aug. 5, 2019. The oil was carried aboard a Liberia-flagged vessel called the Delta Aigaion, according to Refinitiv Eikon data and an internal PDVSA document seen by Reuters. The crude was a heavy blend known as Merey 16, which is unique to Venezuela, and the customer was listed as Rosneft Trading, the PDVSA document shows. The Delta Aigaion sailed to waters off Malaysia near the port of Tanjung Bruas. There, the crew used a STS transfer to offload the Merey 16 to another tanker, the Malta-flagged Lipari, on Oct. 28, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The Lipari then headed for China, discharging its crude on Dec. 12 at the port of Zhanjiang, the data show.Refinitiv Eikon ship-tracking data shows the location of ships and indicates how full they are. In this case, the data showed that the draft of each ship changed dramatically while the two were in the same location off Malaysia’s coast at the same time. The draft is the vertical distance between the waterline and the bottom of a vessel’s hull - a sign of how heavy a load it is carrying. The draft measurements showed that the Delta Aigaion arrived in Malaysia full and left empty, while the opposite was true for the Lipari - an indication that an oil transfer between the two took place.In a photo taken using a European Space Agency radar satellite and provided to Reuters by San Francisco-based earth imaging company Planet Labs, the Delta Aigaion and the Lipari can be seen approaching one another to start the oil transfer on Oct 28. The authenticity of that photo was verified by oil industry data provider TankerTrackers.com, which specializes in satellite image analysis for vessel tracking.Refinitiv Eikon retrieves location information from satellite images as well as from land-based sensors that collect data from ships’ transponders. Ships are required by international maritime law to carry transponders to transmit information about their position, speed and destination. The US government has accused tankers and shipping firms transporting oil from Venezuela and Iran of manipulating this data to evade authorities, either by flashing false destinations or simply turning off their transponders. The Delta Aigaion, while on its way to Venezuela in July after leaving its previous berthing in India, never indicated it was heading to the South American country, Refinitiv Eikon data show. The tanker listed its destination as “For Orders,” a message meaning it had not yet received instructions on where to go next.Delta Tankers Ltd and TMS Tankers Ltd, the shipping companies that manage the Delta Aigaion and Lipari, respectively, did not respond to requests for comment. MMC Corp Bhd and T.A.G. Marine Sdn Bhd, which operate the Tanjung Bruas and Kuala Linggi ports, respectively, did not respond to requests for comment. When the Lipari unloaded in the southwestern Chinese city of Zhanjiang, Chinese customs labeled the crude as “Singma blend,” a grade of crude that did not exist in the market before last year. Customs recorded the country of origin as Malaysia.Li, the Refinitiv analyst, said the labeling of the crude as a blend appears to be incorrect. If the crude were a blend of different grades - a practice common in the oil industry - the STS operation would have involved multiple vessels bringing crude from separate origins, Li said. Ship-tracking data show no indication that this occurred. “It doesn’t look like there’s any blending,” Li said.For 14 of the 18 tankers reviewed by Reuters, the grade of crude recorded by Chinese customs was Singma or Mal, another blend that did not exist before last year, data compiled by Li show. In other cases, the Venezuelan crude was given the names of more established Malaysian grades such as Miri or Kimanis, or was not specified, according to the data compiled by Li. Merey 16, the Venezuelan blend, was not mentioned.Roseneft exitThe arrival of Venezuelan oil in China via STS transfers continued through at least the first two months of 2020. During January and February, Chinese customs once again reported no imports of Venezuelan crude. However, nearly 130,000 barrels per day of PDVSA oil arrived at Chinese ports in those two months from seven tankers that had done STS operations, according to the Reuters review.With US pressure on Venezuela rising, it is unclear whether the tactics PDVSA and its partners employed over the past year to export Venezuelan oil will remain viable. Even before it announced its complete withdrawal from Venezuela on March 28, Rosneft had not lifted any crude from the country’s ports for around a month. Meanwhile, global oil prices have plunged in recent months due to a collapse in demand resulting from the spread of the novel coronavirus. Venezuela’s crude output has dropped by more than 20% this year to below 700,000 barrels per day. Still, there are signs the discreet trade will continue.With few established oil companies willing to buy oil directly from Venezuela over fears of provoking Trump, two little-known Mexican firms - Libre Abordo and Schlager Business Group - recently emerged as the largest intermediaries for PDVSA crude. The companies told Reuters they had a deal with Maduro’s government to supply goods, including corn and water trucks, in exchange for the oil, which they then resell. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation has been investigating the two companies, among others, as part of an inquiry into possible violations of US sanctions on PDVSA, according to three people familiar with the matter.The Mexican firms said swaps of goods for Venezuelan oil were permitted under US sanctions as long as no cash payments reached Maduro’s government. The companies said they have no knowledge of any US investigation into their practices.On Feb. 11, a Panama-flagged tanker named the Athens Voyager loaded some 700,000 barrels of crude near western Venezuela’s Amuay oil port, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Its customer was Libre Abordo, according to an internal PDVSA document viewed by Reuters. On Sunday, April 5, the fully loaded Athens Voyager arrived at its destination: the Linggi STS hub off the coast of Malaysia. There it pumped its cargo onto a Liberia-flagged vessel named the Loyalty A on April 17.The manager of the Athens Voyager, Greece-based Chemnav Shipmanagement Ltd, deferred comment to the vessel’s owner, Marshall Islands-based Afranav Maritime Ltd. The manager of the Loyalty A, Jacinta Marine Corp of Lagos, Nigeria, did not respond to a request for comment.On June 2, the US Treasury Department announced sanctions against Afranav Shipmanagement for its alleged role in trading Venezuelan oil. It said the Athens Voyager had lifted oil from Venezuelan ports as recently as mid-February.Afranav did not respond to requests for comment.Libre Abordo, meanwhile, declared bankruptcy on May 31. It said its arrangement with Venezuela had been suspended by Maduro, and that it was the target of an international pressure campaign driven by Washington. In a June 8 email to Reuters, Libre Abordo confirmed that the oil transported aboard the Athens Voyager was registered in its name. On June 10, Libre Abordo said further that the documentation of origin reflected that the crude came from Venezuela. The company said it sent the oil to Malaysia, where it was offloaded to another ship at the behest of the final customer, whose name it would not disclose.According to Refinitiv Eikon data, the receiving vessel, the Loyalty A, is currently en route to Qingdao, China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vast-amounts-of-venezuelan-oil-are-hidden-en-route-to-china-bypassing-us-sanctions-data-documents/story-5xTMzNc9dRhDnzjKLf5vCK.html
12-06-2020||World||Covid-19: UK GDP drops record 20% as airlines challenge quarantine||The United Kingdom’s economy shrank by a record 20 per cent in April in the first month of lockdown, new figures said on Friday, as three airlines challenged the Boris Johnson government’s quarantine rules in the high court. Calling the GDP contraction “historic”, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the fall affected virtually all areas of activity. The 20 per cent fall is thrice more than that recorded during the 2008 economic downturn.Reacting to the figures, chancellor Rishi Sunak said: “In line with many other economies around the world, coronavirus is having a severe impact on our economy”, adding that furlough scheme, grants, loans and tax cuts will help the economy recover quickly.“We’ve set out our plan to gradually and safely reopen the economy. Next week, more shops on the high street will be able to open again as we start to get our lives a little bit more back to normal,” Sunak added.Presenting the figures, Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at ONS, said: “April’s fall in GDP is the biggest the UK has ever seen, more than three times larger than last month and almost 10 times larger than the steepest pre-Covid-19 fall.”The ONS figure complements recent assessment by OECD that the UK economy would shrink by more than any developed country and by the Bank of England that GDP could contract by 25% in the second quarter and unemployment more than double.As analysts debated the ONS figures, British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair announced that they had launched legal action against quarantine rules that took effect on Monday. According to them, the rules will end up crippling airlines and tourism industries.Terming the rules ‘flawed’, they said there was so far no “evidence on how and when proposed ‘air bridges’ between the UK and other countries will be implemented”, adding that there was no consultation and no scientific evidence provided to support the policy.Under the rules defended by home secretary Priti Patel, most inbound travellers into UK ports need to self-isolate for 14 days, except those from Ireland, Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Many airlines have shed thousands of jobs in recent days and weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-gdp-drops-record-20-as-airlines-challenge-quarantine/story-jh1YjWE3byTvstCZ4EsGJL.html
12-06-2020||World||Black Lives Matter protests: Winston Churchill, Mahatma Gandhi statues in London covered||The statues of Winston Churchill and Mahatma Gandhi in Parliament Square have been boarded up to prevent them from being targeted during Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests that have sparked a review of historical figures in public places across the UK.The statues of Churchill and Gandhi were targeted during Sunday’s large demonstration in London, while in Bristol, the statue of 17th century slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down and thrown into the Avon river.As another major demonstration is planned for the weekend, London’s local officials boarded up statues of Churchill, Gandhi and Nelson Mandela, as well as the Cenotaph (war memorial) in nearby Whitehall.In Leicester, the local council said it would review the Gandhi statue on Belgrave Road, along with other statues, street and building names. An online petition seeking its removal was close to reaching the limit of 5,000 signatories before being submitted to the council.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that it is “absurd and shameful” that Churchill’s statue has been so targeted, and recalled the former prime minister’s contribution to British and European history, particularly during the Second World War.He said in a series of tweets: “The statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square is a permanent reminder of his achievement in saving this country – and the whole of Europe – from a fascist and racist tyranny”.“It is absurd and shameful that this national monument should today be at risk of attack by violence protestors. Yes, he sometimes expressed opinions that were and are unacceptable to us today, but he was a hero, and he fully deserves his memorial”.Johnson, who wrote a biography of Churchill in 2014, added: “We cannot now try to edit or censor our past. We cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations”.“They had different perspectives, different understandings or rights and wrongs. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults. To tear them down would be to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come”.Appealing to people to stay away from demonstrations, Johnson alleged that the protests had been hijacked by extremists intent on violence. The attacks on police in recent protests, he said, were intolerant and abhorrent.On the remove-Gandhi-statue petition in Leicester, former MP Keith Vaz said: “This is a dreadful petition that seeks to divide communities in Leicester and in the country. Those behind it know full well the consequences of what they are asking for. Gandhi’s statues in Leicester and London are an inspiration for peace, harmony and non violence”. “He was one of the greatest peacemakers in history. If this is not withdrawn I will certainly refer it to the police to consider whether it incites racial hatred. We have come a long way in 33 years on racial equality but clearly there is a long way to go. If there is any attempt to remove it I will be there to defend it personally,” he added. A Leicester City Council spokesperson said: “We are aware of an online petition, calling for a statue of Gandhi – funded by a charitable organisation and erected in Leicester in 2009 – to be removed”. “Although this petition has not yet been submitted to us, these representations will be considered as part of a wider conversation about the context, relevance and appropriateness of street names, statues and monuments in the city”.“In such a culturally-diverse city as Leicester, it’s important that we respect the histories of all our communities and understand the context for the historical references that are part of our streetscape and built environment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-protests-winston-churchill-mahatma-gandhi-statues-in-london-covered/story-RrQDZD79f36NtfvzYjpZmN.html
12-06-2020||World||Iran asks French experts to read black boxes of downed Ukrainian plane||Iranian investigators have asked France’s BEA air accident agency to read black boxes from a downed Ukrainian jetliner, Iran’s envoy to the United Nations aviation agency said.The Ukraine International Airlines flight was shot down on January 8 by an Iranian ground-to-air missile, killing 176 people in what Tehran termed a “disastrous mistake” at a time of heightened tensions with the United States.The fate of the cockpit voice and data ‘black-box’ recorders has been the subject of an international standoff eclipsed by the coronavirus crisis, which Iran says has also contributed to delays in a probe by Iran’s Air Accident Investigation Board.Progress was discussed at a council meeting of the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization on Wednesday.“Iran’s AAIB recently made a request to the BEA that the recorders should be taken by Iran to the BEA’s premises in France to be read in the presence of representatives of other involved countries and ICAO, if the BEA is in a position to accommodate this,” Farhad Parvaresh, Iran’s representative to the UN agency, told Reuters by telephone.The BEA said it had not formally received the request and remained in discussions with Iran, Canada and Ukraine on any involvement it may have. Canada had 57 citizens on board.Iran has accused the United States, which built the Boeing 737-800, of refusing to provide software to decipher the recorders, while Canada and Ukraine have accused Tehran of dragging its feet over the probe.Sources said earlier this week that Iran had told ICAO it would take the recorders to Paris once countries involved in the probe agreed.Iran had earlier said it would send them to Ukraine.Canada this week called on Iran to allow the recorders to be downloaded in a suitable facility as soon as possible.The BEA last month read black-box data from a Pakistan-operated Airbus that crashed in Karachi on May 22. Pakistani investigators are expected to issue a preliminary report soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-asks-french-experts-to-read-black-boxes-of-downed-ukrainian-plane/story-3tO8tFmIeltmuc29HOpwXO.html
12-06-2020||World||China’s capital Beijing reports new coronavirus cases for second day||China’s capital reported two new coronavirus infections on Friday, a day after it declared its first case in nearly two months, prompting officials to delay plans for some students to return school. The new cases, from a different part of Beijing than Thursday’s infection, involved two men working at a meat research centre, state media said.It was not immediately clear how they were infected. Both men, aged 25 and 37, had had no contact with people from Hubei province, where the coronavirus was first identified, or travellers from overseas in the last 14 days, state media said, though the younger man was briefly in Qingdao city in the eastern province of Shandong.The Beijing city government said it had dropped plans to reopen school on Monday for students from the first to third grades because of the new cases. It said restaurants would be inspected and checks made on seafood products and fresh and frozen meats.The research facility, the China Meat Food Comprehensive Research Centre, in Fengtai district in the south of Beijing, remained open on Friday, according to the state-run Beijing Daily. Reuters could not immediately reach the Beijing Academy of Food Sciences, which oversees the centre, for comment.Two food markets within a 7 km radius of the plant had mostly been closed. State media Beijing News said city authorities had shut down beef and mutton trading at the Xinfadi wholesale market, where they carried out tests and disinfection after Thursday’s patient was found to have visited. Beijing’s Jingshen seafood market had also closed, the Beijing News added, saying that although the market gave no reason for the closure, Friday’s patients had visited recently.The men had been to Xinfadi, and recently also visited Dongsiqu agricultural wholesale market in Pinggu district, in the northeast of Beijing, state media reported, adding that the market would be closed from Saturday until further notice. The coronavirus is believed by many to have emerged at a seafood market in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-capital-beijing-reports-new-coronavirus-cases-for-second-day/story-pukdTUgBxRIgP6vJ3q0VbL.html

I understand he is a researcher in cardiovascular diseases, so I don’t see that he has jeopardized the national interest or security of the US,” said foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying at a regular press briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alleged-chinese-spy-arrested-at-la-airport-for-visa-fraud/story-RAFEqsWh0Fyk4FDGYZRh9I.html

Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters during a daily briefing that one reason for the deterioration in bilateral relations since a summit in Singapore in 2018 was because North Korea’s legitimate concerns had not been resolved. North Korea sees little use maintaining a personal relationship between its leader, Kim Jong Un, and U.S. President Donald Trump if Washington sticks to hostile policies, state media reported on Friday - the two-year anniversary of the leaders’ first summit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-us-should-address-north-korea-s-concerns/story-X7PLCO4bizAvOyUIajgclI.html
12-06-2020||World||North Korea denounces US two years after Singapore summit||North Korea criticised Donald Trump in a stinging denunciation of the United States on Friday, the second anniversary of a landmark summit in Singapore where the US president shook hands with leader Kim Jong Un.It was the latest in a series of vitriolic statements from Pyongyang aimed at both Washington and Seoul, and came a day after the North implicitly threatened to disrupt November’s election if the US did not stay out of inter-Korean affairs. In recent days, Pyongyang has excoriated the South over defectors launching leaflets criticising Kim into the North and announced it was cutting all official communication links with Seoul.Friday’s broadside contained some of the harshest criticism Pyongyang has sent Washington’s way in recent months, and casts doubt over the future of the two sides’ long-stalled nuclear talks process.In the onslaught, the North’s foreign minister Ri Son Gwon accused Washington of hypocrisy and seeking regime change, saying that the hopes of 2018 had “faded away into a dark nightmare”.Trump and Kim were all smiles in front of the world’s cameras in Singapore as a North Korean leader met a sitting US president for the first time, and afterwards Trump proclaimed on Twitter that “There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.”But a second meeting in Hanoi last year to put meat on the bones of the North’s vaguely worded Singapore pledge to “work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula” collapsed over what Pyongyang would be willing to give up in exchange for sanctions relief.- ‘Hypocritical’ - US diplomats insist that they believe Kim promised in Singapore to give up its arsenal, something Pyongyang has taken no steps to do.The North is under multiple international sanctions over its banned weapons programmes.It believes it deserves to be rewarded for its moratorium on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests and the disabling of its atomic test site, along with the return of jailed US citizens and remains of soldiers killed in the Korean War.“Nothing is more hypocritical than an empty promise,” Ri said in his statement, carried by the official KCNA news agency.Trump has made much of his connection with Kim -- at one point declaring that they had fallen “in love” through their exchanges of letters.But Ri said Pyongyang now believed there was no hope for an improvement “simply by maintaining personal relations between our Supreme Leadership and the US President”.He stopped just short of criticising Trump by name, but referred to comments that “the master of the White House” had “reeled off time and time again as a boast”.“Never again will we provide the US chief executive with another package to be used... without receiving any returns.”Pyongyang’s latest comments were not an empty threat, said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a former North Korea analyst for the US government.“North Koreans know they will not be getting what they want either from South Korea or the US,” she told AFP. “Diplomacy no longer seems to be in the cards.”North Korea’s chief diplomatic ally China urged Washington to acknowledge Pyongyang’s “legitimate concerns”, with foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying insisting the North had taken denuclearisation measures that merited a commensurate US response.- Deadline passed -Trump and Kim met a third time in June 2019 in the Demilitarized Zone dividing the Korean peninsula, when Trump stepped onto North Korean soil -- a first for any American president.But the meeting produced little in terms of tangible progress.Subsequently, the North repeatedly demanded that the US offer it fresh concessions by December 31, but the deadline came and went.Kim declared the North no longer considered itself bound by its unilateral testing moratoriums. It has not yet carried out any such actions, but analysts believe it has continued to develop its arsenal throughout the discussions.Ri accused Washington of seeking regime change and said the North had decided to bolster its nuclear deterrent “to cope with the US unabated threats of nuclear war”.Pyongyang has carried out a series of tests of shorter-range weapons in recent months -- often describing them as multiple launch rocket systems, although Japan and the United States have called them ballistic missiles.The process leading to the Singapore summit was brokered by the South’s President Moon Jae-in, but his office said Friday it had no comment to make on the anniversary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-denounces-us-two-years-after-singapore-summit/story-Zg3oNRSpwap729D148RXMI.html
12-06-2020||World||UK’s biggest airlines launch legal action over quarantine rules||The biggest airlines operating in the UK sued the government to overturn a new requirement that people arriving in Britain self-isolate for two weeks amid the Covid-19 pandemic.British Airways moved with budget carriers Ryanair Holdings Plc and EasyJet Plc to try to block the rules, which began Monday. They require travelers arriving in the UK to self-quarantine despite criticism from the airline industry that the move will stop lockdown-weary customers from booking summer vacations.The government’s plan “will have a devastating effect on British tourism and the wider economy and destroy thousands of jobs,” the airlines said Friday in an emailed statement. They’ve asked for their judicial review to be heard as soon as possible.British Airways parent IAG SA wrote to the Home Office to start a process to block the measure last week, but was left disappointed by the government response. On Friday, the Home Office declined to immediately comment on the lawsuit.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is trying to balance the need for businesses to reopen with the risks of controlling the spread of coronavirus, which has hit the UK worse than any other European country. The government, which made a series of radical moves in March including ordering many businesses to shut, is now taking measures to ease the lockdown and encourage the economy to start moving again.BA and its rivals want the government to roll its plan back to rules in force since March 10, which required only travelers from “high risk” countries to self-isolate.The new rules are tougher on travelers than on people who have been confirmed with Covid-19, the airlines said. Their challenge says the requirements weren’t properly discussed and haven’t been backed up by scientific advice. Frequent fliers from countries such as France and Germany, where infection rates have dropped, are being penalized, the airlines said.Global carriers have been some of the worst hit businesses. The International Air Transport Association on Tuesday predicted carriers will lose a combined $84 billion this year and almost $16 billion in 2021, its first estimate of the hit to earnings since the coronavirus crisis began. That compares with $31 billion during the 2008-2009 recession.With infection levels on the decline in most European countries, governments have been easing travel restrictions, and beaches are opening in Greece, Spain and Portugal. Airlines are trying to salvage the summer season when tens of millions of people generally take their vacation.The quarantine would torpedo BA’s plans to resume about 40% of its scheduled flights in July and force it to continue burning 20 million pounds ($25 million) a day, the carrier said. EasyJet is planning to resume some scheduled flights June 15, while Ryanair plans to restart flying July 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-biggest-airlines-launch-legal-action-over-quarantine-rules/story-arOqUDnEhc7mqwNR1pd3fM.html

Two colleagues, both male, working at the China Meat Food Comprehensive Research Centre were diagnosed with the disease in the city’s Fengtai district, Beijing health authorities said on Friday.Both patients, one 37, the other, 25, have been transferred to designated hospitals and medics are now carrying out contact tracing among the family, friends and remaining office workers who shared space with the two.One of the two patients had also travelled to the city of Qingdao in the past week, the officials said.Meanwhile, nearly 50 primary school students and teachers have been quarantined at home after a fourth-grader’s father was diagnosed with Covid-19 this week, the first locally transmitted case in Beijing reported in nearly two months.The fear of a school-based cluster infection breaking out in Beijing as the city nears normalcy means health authorities have swung back into action with contact tracing.It is still a mystery how the 52-year-old male patient Tang Moumou, resident of Beijing’s Xicheng district, was infected as he has told the authorities that he never left Beijing nor did he meet anyone from outside the city.Tang’s son and another family member have tested negative for the coronavirus, a Beijing health official said on Friday.However, the son’s classmates and teachers who have interacted with him have all been sent to home quarantine, to be spent under medical observation.Under the emergency response plan, 33 other students in the class of Tang’s child and 15 faculty members who have been in contact with the class are all being observed at home. Classrooms, toilets and other public areas in the school have been disinfectedTang’s apartment complex has been put under “closed loop” management and entry and exit are now being monitored with temperature checks made mandatory. Pang Xinghuo, deputy head of the Beijing Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the new case had “sounded the alarm for us that the risk of another outbreak exists all the time”.“It reminds us to have a deep understanding of significance, complexity and uncertainty of the epidemic prevention and control in the capital. We must always tighten the string of epidemic prevention and control,” she said.Beijing last Saturday downgraded its Covid-19 emergency response to level three, the second lowest.However, following the new case, a meeting of the local government emphasised that the “…source of case flow tracing should be carried out strictly and quickly, the tracing time should be long enough, and the scope of close contact should be accurate enough to ensure that no one person is missed”.Meanwhile, the Chinese health authority said Friday that it received reports of seven new confirmed Covid-19 cases on the Chinese mainland Thursday, of which six were imported from overseas.Shanghai reported six new imported Covid-19 cases on Thursday including two Chinese nationals and four Pakistanis.The two Chinese nationals departed from the US and India, arriving at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on June 8 and 9.As of Thursday, according to the official news agency, Xinhua, the overall confirmed cases on the mainland had reached 83064, including 65 patients who were still being treated with no one in severe condition. Altogether 78,365 people had been discharged after recovery and 4,634 people had died of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-reports-2-new-covid-19-cases-students-staff-in-home-quarantine-after-classmate-s-father-tests-positive/story-ZpJ9TdbhgCq0qbZzwW4LsN.html

Tests are underway to see if the tuberculosis vaccine can slow the novel coronavirus, The Washington Post reported on Thursday. “This is the only vaccine in the world that can be given to combat COVID-19 right now,” Jeffrey D Cirillo, a professor of microbial pathogenesis and immunology at Texas A&M Health Science Center, was quoted as saying by the Post. According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the contagion has infected over 75,00,000 people and killed more than 4,20,000 across the world. The US is the worst affected country with over 2.02 million cases and more than 1,13,000 deaths. The COVID-19, which originated in China’s Wuhan city in December last year, has also battered the world economy with the International Monetary Fund saying that the global economy is bound to suffer a “severe recession”. Scientists are racing against time to find a vaccine or medicine for its treatment. Dr Cirillo is leading a trial of the tuberculosis vaccine, called bacillus Calmette-Guérin and known by the shorthand BCG. The BCG vaccine, he said, is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has a lengthy record of being used safely. Another group of scientists, according to report, have proposed using the polio vaccine to slow the COVID-19. “Vaccines developed against TB (tuberculosis) and polio have already been used in millions of people and could offer a low-risk way to rev up the body’s first line of defence — the innate immune system — against a broad array of pathogens, including the coronavirus,” the group said. Pakistani-American Azra Raza, a professor of medicine at Columbia University Medical Center, told the daily that BCG can improve people’s ability to fight off other pathogens, even for patients who are given the vaccine for another approved use, against bladder cancer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-looking-at-tuberculosis-polio-vaccines-to-ward-off-coronavirus-report/story-dL7S9Z5cxj3XXYJ6Ml6AnJ.html

The administration has also moved to ban Chinese graduate students and researchers with links to the People’s Liberation Army or other security services from the United States.The convergence of three carrier strike groups in the region is unusual because of the limited number of carriers and the fact that they are often cycling through repair schedules, port visits, training or deployments to other parts of the world. This week, however, Navy commanders said they were able to take advantage of the timing, particularly during this period of great power competition with China.The US national defense strategy cites China as a top security concern, and Pentagon leaders have been working to shift more resources and military assets to the region to battle what they see is Beijing’s growing economic influence and military might.“The ability to be present in a strong way is part of the competition. And as I always tell my guys here, you’ve got to be present to win when you’re competing,” said Rear Adm. Stephen Koehler, director of operations at Indo-Pacific Command. “Carriers and carrier strike groups writ large are phenomenal symbols of American naval power. I really am pretty fired up that we’ve got three of them at the moment.” Speaking to The Associated Press from his office in Hawaii, Koehler said China is slowly and methodically building up military outposts in the South China Sea, putting missile and electronic warfare systems on them. The US and other allies and partners in the region have beefed up operations near the human-made islands to try to blunt China’s development, but none of that has appeared to work.Koehler said that most recently China deployed aircraft to Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands and is now operating them out of there.On Thursday, the strike group warships were spread out across the Indo-Pacific. The USS Theodore Roosevelt and its strike group are operating in the Philippine Sea near Guam. The USS Nimitz strike group is in the Pacific off the US West Coast. The USS Ronald Reagan has left port in Japan and is operating in the Philippine Sea south of there. Navy commanders were quick to point out that dozens of other Navy ships had been operating around the Pacific, but the three strike groups put a bit of an exclamation point on America’s commitment to the region and its allies. The Roosevelt has just returned to duty after spending more than two months sidelined in Guam with a massive Covid-19 outbreak among its crew. And small numbers of sailors on the Nimitz and the Reagan tested positive for the virus, triggering quarantines and extensive new health and safety procedures that had to be instituted before the ships could deploy.As they deploy, sailors’ daily lives on the ships and to some degree their operations at sea have been altered by the virus and the new precautions they must take to ensure the ships remain clear of infection and able to continue operations.Onboard the Nimitz, Rear Adm. Jim Kirk said there have been no positive cases of the virus on the ship since it set out, and he is confident of all the changes put in place to keep it that way. On the Nimitz and the other Pacific ships, crew members are screened daily, they wear masks where needed, meal hours have been extended to allow for more social distancing, and specific routes are designated on the ship to prevent sailors from bumping into one another in the narrow passageways and stairs.“As we head out to stand the watch, the message that I have is that this is the end of the beginning” for the crew, said Kirk, commander of Carrier Strike Group 11. “Now it’s time to go about doing our job to the best of our abilities.” Koehler said the ships will continue to work with allies and partners in the region, conducting exercises at sea and patrolling contested regions. One key change, however, will be their ability to stop in foreign ports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-naval-buildup-in-indo-pacific-seen-as-warning-to-china/story-RzA5NHQxB2O1bpWZWhXQLK.html
12-06-2020||World||Seattle mayor tells Donald Trump to ‘go back to your bunker’||Seattle’s mayor told Donald Trump to “Go back to your bunker” Thursday, escalating a spat after the president threatened to intervene over a police-free autonomous zone protesters have set up in the western US city.The reference to a “bunker” was a nod to reports Trump was rushed by Secret Service agents to a secure area in the White House as demonstrations against racism and police brutality sparked by the death of George Floyd reached the president’s residence. Trump sparked the spat when he threatened to intervene in the neighbourhood in Seattle dubbed “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone,” or CHAZ, which was agreed upon by demonstrators and the city’s police department.“Take back your city NOW. If you don’t do it, I will,” Trump warned mayor Jenny Durkan and Washington state governor Jay Inslee -- both Democrats -- in a tweet late Wednesday, calling the protesters “domestic terrorists” who have taken over Seattle. Radical Left Governor @JayInslee and the Mayor of Seattle are being taunted and played at a level that our great Country has never seen before. Take back your city NOW. If you don’t do it, I will. This is not a game. These ugly Anarchists must be stopped IMMEDIATELY. MOVE FAST!“This is not a game. These ugly Anarchists must be stooped (sic) IMMEDIATELY. MOVE FAST,” he continued in another tweet.Mayor Jenny Durkan replied, urging Trump to “make us all safe. Go back to your bunker”, with Inslee joining in the Twitter mockery of Trump.Make us all safe. Go back to your bunker. #BlackLivesMatter https://t.co/H3TXduhlY4||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seattle-mayor-tells-donald-trump-to-go-back-to-your-bunker/story-LW9GruO9PbbJvEHr3cFwIJ.html
12-06-2020||World||Donald Trump considering suspending H1B, other visas: Report||US President Donald Trump is considering suspending a number of employment visas including the H1B, most sought-after among Indian IT professionals, in view of the massive unemployment in America due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a media report. The proposed suspension could extend into the government’s new fiscal year beginning October 1, when many new visas are issued, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, quoting unnamed administration officials. “That could bar any new H1B holder outside the country from coming to work until the suspension is lifted, though visa holders already in the country are unlikely to be affected,” the daily reported. H1B is the most coveted foreign work visas for technology professionals from India. Such a decision by the Trump administration is likely to have an adverse impact on thousands of Indian IT professionals. Already a large number of Indians on the H1B visas have lost their jobs and are headed back home during the coronavirus pandemic. The White House, however, said that no final decision has been made and the administration is considering various proposals. “The administration is currently evaluating a wide range of options, formulated by career experts, to protect American workers and job seekers especially disadvantaged and underserved citizens — but no decisions of any kind have been made,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement. In addition to the H1B visas, the suspension could apply to the H-2B visa for short-term seasonal workers, the J-1 visa for short-term workers including camp counselors and au pairs and the L-1 visa for internal company transfers, the financial daily reported. Meanwhile, the US Chambers of Commerce CEO Thomas Donohue on Thursday wrote a letter to Trump, expressing concern over his reported move on temporary work visas. “As the economy rebounds, American businesses will need assurances that they can meet all their workforce needs. To that end, it is crucial that they have access to talent both domestically and from around the world,” Donohue wrote in a letter to Trump. According to The Hill newspaper, Donohue said that American businesses need L-1 visa holders, who have a work visa valid for a relatively short amount of time, for necessary expertise. He noted the importance of H1B visa holders, who have a work visa valid for multiple years, for various industries, including technology, accounting and manufacturers, the newspaper said. “Policies that would, for example, impose wide-ranging bans on the entry of nonimmigrant workers or impose burdensome new regulatory requirements on businesses that employ foreign nationals would undermine that access to talent and in the process, undercut our economy’s ability to grow and create jobs,” Donohue added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-considering-suspending-h1b-other-visas-report/story-IOMwjkhKwe6n2WF6bbOoYL.html
12-06-2020||World||On Kim-Trump summit anniversary, North Korea vows to build up military||North Korea on Friday again vowed to build up its military force to counter what it perceives as US threats and said there would be little reason for a personal relationship between leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump if Washington persists with sanctions and pressure.On the two-year anniversary of the leaders’ first summit, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Son Gwon said the North would never again gift Trump with high-profile meetings and concessions he could boast as foreign policy achievements unless it gets something substantial in return.“The question is whether there will be a need to keep holding hands shaken in Singapore, as we see that there is nothing of factual improvement to be made in the DPRK-US relations simply by maintaining personal relations between our supreme leadership and the US President,” Ri said in a statement carried by state media, referring to North Korea by its formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.“Never again will we provide the US chief executive with another package to be used for (political) achievements without receiving any returns. Nothing is more hypocritical than an empty promise.”In their 2018 summit in Singapore, the first-ever meeting between active leaders of the two countries, Kim and Trump agreed to improve bilateral relations and issued a vague statement on a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without describing when and how it would occur.But negotiations faltered after the United States rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of the North’s nuclear capabilities at Kim’s second summit with Trump in Vietnam in February 2019.Trump and Kim met for a third time last June at the inter-Korean border, but a subsequent working-level meeting broke down over what the North Koreans described as the Americans’ “old stance and attitude.”Kim, who unilaterally suspended nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests during talks with Washington and Seoul, entered the new year vowing to bolster his nuclear deterrent. The North in recent months conducted short-range missile tests while also dialing up pressure on South Korea.Ri said the past two years of diplomacy has only revealed that the United States the continues to pursue “regime change” in Pyongyang and threatens the North with the prospects of a pre-emptive nuclear strike and “isolation and suffocation.”“The secure strategic goal of the DPRK is to build up more reliable force to cope with the long-term military threats from the Us,” he said.North Korea has suspended virtually all cooperation with South Korea in recent months while pressuring Seoul to defy US-led international sanctions and restart inter-Korean economic projects that would breathe life into the North’s struggling economy.It also has threatened to end an inter-Korean military agreement reached in 2018 while expressing anger over South Korea’s inability to stop activists from floating anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-kim-trump-summit-anniversary-north-korea-vows-to-build-up-military/story-PwRkaB1hEDR8D0GxKLUDmL.html
12-06-2020||World||White House eyes travel from Mexico as source of Covid-19 infection||The White House is exploring the possibility that travel from Mexico may be contributing to a new wave of coronavirus infections, rather than states’ moves toward reopening their economies.The notion was discussed at some length Thursday during a meeting of the administration’s coronavirus task force in the White House Situation Room that focused on identifying commonalities between new outbreaks. Officials also considered how to surge response capabilities.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was deploying teams to Arizona and other hotspots to try to trace the outbreaks and contain them.In addition to Arizona, other states experiencing recent spikes of infections include California, Texas and North Carolina — particularly within the Hispanic community. As a result, the task force is looking at whether those spikes may be tied to legal travel between the US and Mexico, which is experiencing an ongoing severe coronavirus outbreak.Two officials familiar with the discussions described them to The Associated Press, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly describe internal conversations.While President Donald Trump has gone to great lengths to seal US borders to both legal and illegal immigrants during the outbreak, American citizens and permanent residents are still allowed entry to the US, as are agricultural workers.The White House task force was also looking at other causes for a recent uptick in numbers, noting that the issues likely differ by location. Delays in test reporting and the fact that some infected people take multiple tests in order to get an all-clear to return to work are among the other theories that are being explored.Trump has long pointed to Mexico as a source of crime and disease in the US, and has used the crisis to push forward some of his most hard-line immigration proposals, including blocking asylum at the border and limiting the issuance of green cards to those living outside the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-eyes-travel-from-mexico-as-source-of-covid-19-infection/story-g6yztZwqQIJB2LdZHfYd8K.html
12-06-2020||World||India rejects US govt report on religious freedom||India on Thursday rejected a US government report that raised concerns over alleged attacks and discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities in the country.“Our principled position remains that we see no locus standi for a foreign entity to pronounce on the state of our citizens’ constitutionally protected rights,” Spokesperson in the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava said.He was replying to a question on the report at an online media briefing.Mandated by the US Congress, the ‘2019 International Religious Freedom Report’ that documents major instances of the violation of religious freedom across the world was released by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday.“India’s vibrant democratic traditions and practices are evident to the world. The people and government of India are proud of our country’s democratic traditions,” the spokesperson said.“We have a robust public discourse in India and constitutionally mandated institutions that guarantee protection of religious freedom and rule of law,” he added.The India section of the report said that the US government officials underscored the importance of respecting religious freedom, promoting tolerance and mutual respect with the ruling and opposition parties and religious leaders belonging to various communities.In their engagement with government officials, media, interfaith harmony organizations and NGOs, US officials emphasised the need to address the legitimate concerns of the country’s religious minorities, condemn communal rhetoric, and ensure full protection of minorities, it said.The report also referred to the revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir last August and the parliament passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in December as major highlights for India last year.“The report is published annually by the department of state as part of its legal requirement to the US Congress and is an internal document of the US government,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-rejects-us-govt-report-on-religious-freedom/story-biNdVHa5s7tMM7lFNpQjyH.html
12-06-2020||World||Hong Kong’s anti-government protests complete one year||One year ago, a sea of humanity — a million people by some estimates — streamed through central Hong Kong on a steamy afternoon. It was the start of what would grow into the longest-lasting and most violent anti-government movement the city has seen since its return to China in 1997. A year later, as new protests simmer, China is poised to enact a national security law to crack down on further disturbance. After 12 months of exhilaration for some, exasperation for others and exhaustion for all, Hong Kong’s future still hangs in the balance.JUNE 9, 2019: Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrate against proposed amendments to Hong Kong laws that would allow suspects to be extradited to China to face trial. Many feel the legislation would undermine the “one country, two systems” principle under which Hong Kong was returned to China by exposing residents to a murky legal system with fewer protections. An even larger march against the proposal took place the following week.JUNE 12: Protesters take over the streets around Hong Kong’s legislature, known as Legco, and prevent lawmakers from entering to debate the extradition bill. Some throw rocks and metal barricades at police. Officers use tear gas to disperse the crowds in what will become a common practice in the months ahead.JULY 1: Protesters smash their way into the legislature building on a public holiday, spray-paint slogans on the walls, tear down the portraits of legislative leaders and deface the Hong Kong city emblem in the main chamber. The legislature remains closed for repairs for a few months.AUG. 17: A large contingent of Chinese militarized police with armored vehicles mass to hold drills in Shenzhen, the mainland city bordering Hong Kong. The presence of the People’s Armed Police, whose functions include crowd and riot control, sparks speculation that they would intervene in Hong Kong’s protests.AUG. 25: Hong Kong police deploy a water cannon for the first time as clashes with protesters escalate. The water is often laced with pepper spray to cause a stinging sensation and dyed with coloring to mark the clothing of those who join protests.SEPT. 4: With no end in sight for the protests, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam says the government will formally withdraw the extradition legislation. By then, though, the movement’s demands have expanded to include an independent investigation into alleged police brutality against protesters, the unconditional release of those detained and greater democracy in city elections.NOV. 2019: Protesters occupy and barricade several university campuses for several days and battle police outside in some of the most violent clashes in the months of protests.NOV. 24: The pro-democracy opposition wins a sweeping victory in district council elections across the city of 7.5 million people. The results buoy the protesters, but pro-Beijing parties remain in control of the legislature, where only half the members are elected by popular vote.SPRING 2020: The protests ease somewhat in the weeks following the election and are further slowed by the coronavirus outbreak. The arrest of 15 prominent pro-democracy activists in mid-April sparks small protests in shopping malls that are broken up by police, who cite virus-related limits on the size of public gatherings.MAY 28: China’s National People’s Congress ratifies a decision to develop national security laws for Hong Kong. Chinese and Hong Kong leaders say the protests created an urgent need for such laws. Pro-democracy activists and many legal experts fear a further erosion of “one-country, two systems.” The laws are expected to be enacted by the end of the summer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-anti-government-protests-complete-one-year/story-yFt8Lzas9SVk2sPiKSenzJ.html

12-06-2020||World||Twitter shuts down 1.7 lakh accounts for spreading Chinese govt narratives||Twitter has removed a vast network of accounts that it says is linked to the Chinese government and were pushing false information favourable to the country’s communist rulers. Beijing denied involvement Friday and said the company should instead take down accounts smearing China. The US social media company suspended 23,750 accounts that were posting pro-Beijing narratives, and another 150,000 accounts dedicated to retweeting and amplifying those messages.The network was engaged “in a range of coordinated and manipulated activities” in predominantly Chinese languages, including praise for China’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and “deceptive narratives” about Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, the company said.The accounts also tweeted about two other topics: Taiwan and Guo Wengui, an exiled billionaire waging a campaign from New York against China’s president and party leader Xi Jinping and his administration. Most had little to no followers and failed to get much attention. The accounts were suspended under Twitter’s manipulation policies, which ban artificial amplification and suppression of information.Twitter and other social media services like Facebook and YouTube are blocked in China.“While the Chinese Communist Party won’t allow the Chinese people to use Twitter, our analysis shows it is happy to use it to sow propaganda and disinformation internationally,” said Fergus Hanson, director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s International Cyber Policy Centre, which worked with the company on the takedown.China denied involvement.“It holds no water at all to equate China’s response to the epidemic with disinformation,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a daily news briefing on Friday.“If Twitter wants to make a difference, it should shut down those accounts that have been organized and coordinated to attack and discredit China,” she added.Twitter also removed more than 1,000 accounts linked to a Russian media website engaging in state-backed political propaganda in Russian, and a network of 7,340 fake or compromised accounts used for “cheerleading” the ruling party in Turkey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-shuts-down-1-7-lakh-accounts-for-spreading-chinese-govt-narratives/story-FZGZjw6aq2DWEEdwcsArzL.html
12-06-2020||World||Canada’s foreign minister faces heat over $1mn loan from Chinese bank||Canada’s seniormost diplomat finds himself embroiled in a controversy, facing questions in the country’s parliament and from the media over a debt of more than 1 million Canadian Dollars to a state-owned Chinese bank. According to a report in the daily Globe and Mail, foreign minister Francoise-Philippe Champagne had taken out a mortgage with the Bank of China to purchase two residences in London. Those loans were taken before he was first elected an MP in 2015, and have been partly repaid, with approximately CA $ 1.2 million outstanding. Champagne’s office also clarified to the daily that these loans were disclosed to the country’s Ethics Commissioner and other relevant agencies.However, critics have argued that circumstances changed after Champagne became the foreign minister, and were particularly relevant since two Canadians, including a former diplomat, remain in Chinese custody in a move seen as retaliation for the detention of a senior Huawei executive in Vancouver in 2018.The matter was raised in a sitting of the House of Commons by Opposition leader Andrew Scheer who asked the government whether Champagne’s mortgage had come up for renewal after he was elected to Parliament and at what interest rate he had secured the loans. Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland responded those personal details were not available with the Government at the time. Scheer later tweeted, “This is incredible. The person who should be representing Canada’s interests is indebted to a bank run by the Chinese Communist Party. How did Justin Trudeau think he was an acceptable pick for Minister of Foreign Affairs?”Columnist John Ivison wrote in the newspaper, National Post: “When you owe someone more than $1 million, the potential for influence and abuse is ever-present.” He also cited Margaret McCuaig Johnston, a senior fellow at the China Institute at the University of Alberta, as saying, “It is inconceivable that this is not at the back of his mind as he deals with the government of China, his most difficult file.”As the matter roils Canadian politics, it comes at a time when there is anger in the country over Beijing virtually rescinding the special status of Hong Kong, where nearly 300,000 Canadian citizens live and work. John Higginbotham, who was Canada’s Commissioner to Hong Kong, a role equivalent to that of an Ambassador, was quoted by the Globe and Mail as demanding that Canada boycott the Winter Olympics scheduled to take place in China in February 2022. He was backed by former Canadian Ambassador to Beijing David Mulroney, who tweeted, “For China, the Olympics is an opportunity for Beijing to summon foreign leaders to pay tribute. Hong Kong is only the latest reason why shouldn’t attend. Consider the detention of 1 million Uighurs – and 2 innocent Canadians.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-foreign-minister-faces-heat-over-1mn-loan-from-chinese-bank/story-4KYbqiKMNC7417XiZFj4yI.html
12-06-2020||World||Trump authorises sanctions against International Criminal Court officials||President Donald Trump on Thursday authorised U.S. economic and travel sanctions against International Criminal Court employees involved in an investigation into whether American forces committed war crimes in Afghanistan.In announcing the president’s executive order, Trump administration officials said the Hague-based tribunal threatens to infringe on U.S. national sovereignty and accused Russia of manipulating it to serve Moscow’s ends.“We cannot, we will not stand by as our people are threatened by a kangaroo court,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in announcing the move.“I have a message to many close allies in the world. Your people could be next, especially those from NATO countries who fight terrorism in Afghanistan right alongside us,” he said.In a statement, the ICC said Washington’s move was the “latest in a series of unprecedented attacks on the court.”“These attacks constitute an escalation and an unacceptable attempt to interfere with the rule of law and the Court’s judicial proceedings,” the ICC said.Foreign Minister Stef Blok of the Netherlands, a member of the Western security alliance, wrote on Twitter he was “very disturbed” by the U.S. stance, saying his nation supported the ICC, which he described as “crucial in the fight against impunity.”The sanctions that can be imposed under the order include freezing the U.S. assets of those who help the ICC investigate or prosecute American citizens without U.S. consent, as well as barring them and their families from visiting the United States.Neither Pompeo nor any of the top officials who were present at the announcement - Defense Secretary Mark Esper, national security adviser Robert O’Brien and Attorney General William Barr - took questions from reporters.ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda wants to investigate possible crimes committed between 2003 and 2014, including alleged mass killings of civilians by the Taliban, as well as the alleged torture of prisoners by Afghan authorities and, to a lesser extent, by U.S. forces and the CIA. The ICC investigation was given the go-ahead in March.The ICC decided to investigate after a preliminary examination by prosecutors in 2017 found reasonable grounds to believe war crimes were committed in Afghanistan and that the court has jurisdiction.Rights activists assailed Trump’s move. Andrea Prasow, the Washington director for Human Rights Watch, said the action “demonstrates contempt for the global rule of law” and represents a “blatant attempt at obstruction.”‘LOW POINT’The ICC was established in 2002 by the international community to prosecute war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. It has jurisdiction only if a member state is unable or unwilling to prosecute atrocities itself. The United States has never been a member of the court.The U.S. action is the latest under Trump taking aim at an international body. Trump, who has promoted an “America First” policy, late last month said he would end the U.S. relationship with the World Health Organization.Afghanistan is a member of the ICC, though Kabul has argued that any war crimes should be prosecuted locally.Speaking at the U.S. announcement, Barr said the Justice Department “has received substantial credible information that raises serious concerns about a long history of financial corruption and malfeasance” in the ICC prosecutor’s office. He provided no details.He also said the court was being manipulated by Russia, but did not elaborate on how.John Bellinger, the State Department’s former top lawyer under Republican former President George W. Bush, said the two sides could have avoided the conflict but chose not to.“It’s unfortunate that the long-running U.S. dispute with the ICC has reached this new low point. ... It’s not surprising that the Trump administration has reacted forcefully with threatened sanctions, especially in an election year,” he said.The Trump administration imposed travel restrictions and other sanctions against ICC employees a year ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-authorises-sanctions-against-international-criminal-court-officials/story-2VIEKDuCh1DQdtnMLatKaM.html
12-06-2020||World||Covid-19 crisis could see number of extreme poor rise to 1.1 bln worldwide: Study||The economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic could plunge an extra 395 million people into extreme poverty and swell the total number of those living on less than $1.90 a day worldwide to more than 1 billion, researchers said in a report on Friday.The report - published by UNU-WIDER, part of the United Nations University - played through a number of scenarios, taking into account the World Bank’s various poverty lines - from extreme poverty, defined as living on $1.90 a day or less, to higher poverty lines of living on less than $5.50 a day.Under the worst scenario - a 20% contraction in per capita income or consumption - the number of those living in extreme poverty could rise to 1.12 billion.

12-06-2020||World||North Korea says little reason to maintain Kim-Trump ties on summit anniversary :State Media||North Korea sees little use maintaining a personal relationship between leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump if Washington sticks to hostile policies, state media reported on Friday - the two-year anniversary of the leaders’ first summit.U.S. policies prove Washington remains a long-term threat to the North Korean state and its people and North Korea will develop more reliable military forces to counter that threat, Foreign Minister Ri Son Gwon said in a statement carried by state news agency KCNA.Trump and Kim exchanged insults and threats during 2017 as North Korea made large advances in its nuclear and missile programme and the United States responded by leading an international effort to tighten sanctions.Relations improved significantly around the Singapore summit in June 2018, the first time a sitting American president met with a North Korean leader, but the statement that came out of the meeting was light on specifics.A second summit in February 2019 in Vietnam failed to reach a deal because of conflicts over U.S. calls for North Korea to completely give up its nuclear weapons, and North Korean demands for swift sanctions relief.Ri said in retrospect the Trump administration appears to have been focusing on only scoring political points while seeking to isolate and suffocate North Korea, and threatening it with preemptive nuclear strikes and regime change.“Never again will we provide the U.S. chief executive with another package to be used for achievements without receiving any returns,” he said. “Nothing is more hypocritical than an empty promise.”The U.S. State Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.On Thursday, a State Department spokesperson told South Korea’s Yonhap news agency the United States remains committed to dialogue with North Korea, and is open to a “flexible approach to reach a balanced agreement.”Election PressureOn Thursday North Korea criticized the United States for commenting on inter-Korean affairs, and said Washington should stay quiet if it wants the upcoming presidential election to go smoothly.North Korea is likely to try to increase pressure on the United States ahead of the upcoming election, said Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia until early in the Trump administration.“Trump’s claim to have ‘solved’ the North Korea problem gives them leverage,” he said.Ramon Pacheco Pardo, a Korea expert at King’s College London, said Ri’s statement shows North Korea still sees all options on the table, from a proper diplomatic process to further developing its nuclear programme.“North Korea continues to need a proper deal more than the U.S.,” Pacheco Pardo said on Twitter. “That hasn’t changed.”Ri said North Korea’s desire to open a new cooperative era runs as deep as ever, but that the situation on the Korean peninsula is daily taking a turn for the worse.“The U.S. professes to be an advocate for improved relations with the DPRK, but in fact, it is hell-bent on only exacerbating the situation,” Ri said.The official name of North Korea is the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-says-little-reason-to-maintain-kim-trump-ties-on-summit-anniversary-state-media/story-wwL2YUDSDMCtu5R22L6MeK.html
12-06-2020||World||Donald Trump plans poll rally as anti-racism protesters topple statues of Columbus||Haunted by sagging poll numbers, US President Donald will relaunch his election campaign next week ending a nearly three-month-long pause even as the country is tormented by the coronavirus pandemic and a wave of anti-racism protests. “We’re going to be starting our rallies. The first one, we believe, will probably... be in Tulsa, Oklahoma,” he said on Wednesday.Trump didn’t say what kind of anti-pandemic precautions will be taken at the June 19 rally. Oklahoma has one of the lowest infections rates, with a total of around 7,500. “They’ve done a great job with Covid, as you know, in the state of Oklahoma,” Trump said.Meanwhile, protests raged across the country in the aftermath of George Floyd’s killing. Statues of Italian explorer Christopher Columbus were beheaded and vandalised as calls to remove sculptures commemorating colonisers and slavers swept the US.While most rallies were relatively peaceful, crowds in Portland, Oregon, threw bottles at police. Thomas Lane, one of the former cops charged in Floyd’s killing, was released on bail. Despite the US military’s openness to rename bases christened after Confederate generals who defended slavery, Trump nixed the move. Calling them “monumental and very powerful”, Trump tweeted that the bases are part of a “Great American Heritage, and a history of Winning, Victory and Freedom”. Trump’s spirited defence of the base names came as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered the removal of statutes of confederate figures in the Capitol. And auto-racing company NASCAR outlawed the display of the confederate flag at its events. On Thursday, chairman of the chiefs of staff Mark Milley expressed regret for accompanying Trump on his controversial walk through a park outside the White House violently cleared of peaceful protesters on June 1. Trump had gone on to pose for pictures in front of a church damaged in protests. “I should not have been there. As a commissioned uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I have learned from, and I sincerely hope we all can learn from it,” Milley said in a pre-recorded video address.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-plans-poll-rally-as-anti-racism-protesters-topple-statues-of-columbus/story-NkA2LLBljHPqF0aNmGsjQI.html

12-06-2020||World||Donald Trump and Joe Biden hit campaign trail to tout plans for US economic recovery||President Donald Trump and his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, headed to must-win election battlegrounds on Thursday, seeking to make their cases to voters about who is best positioned to help the economy recover from coronavirus shutdowns.Trump was expected to host a roundtable in Dallas on the economic recovery. Recent opinion polls have shown him in a dead heat with Biden in Texas, which the Republican won by 9 percentage points in 2016.Biden held a similar event in Philadelphia, the largest city in Pennsylvania, a state his campaign regards as crucial in the Nov. 3 election. Trump’s narrow victory there over Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 helped propel him to the White House.Trump, who has made his economic stewardship a key pillar of his re-election campaign, has seen his support in polls drop after his much-criticized handling of the coronavirus pandemic and mass protests against police brutality and racism.But polls have still shown him with an edge in voters’ minds as stronger than Biden on economic issues.Biden rolled out a plan on Thursday to reopen the economy, calling for expanded coronavirus testing and protective equipment for people who go back to work, paid sick leave, small-business grants, fines for businesses that do not abide by safety standards, and hiring a workforce to test the spread of the disease.Meeting with an eyeglass store owner and a union cleaning worker, Biden reiterated his criticism of Trump’s failure “to deal with this crisis.”The US economy is showing only early signs of recovery from a sharp downturn. Stocks slumped on Thursday as investors fretted over a new wave of coronavirus infections and a gloomy economic forecast from the Federal Reserve.The jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed the number of Americans seeking jobless benefits fell last week, but millions laid off because of Covid-19 continued to receive unemployment checks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-and-joe-biden-hit-campaign-trail-to-tout-plans-for-us-economic-recovery/story-nnrCnqDIWxSyXuHdiloWdI.html

Now, teachers will do the same. Those who are responsible for shaping the future of students have been assigned with the job of selling liquor. There is no shame left in the state government,” he said.However, the order was later cancelled by the district administration. For Coronavirus Live UpdatesEarlier, Congress had attacked the government over a photo that went viral on social media on Wednesday, showing a woman cop sitting in a liquor shop.The incident follows the state government’s decision to run about 70% liquor shops across the state on its own from Tuesday after contractors surrendered their licences as per an option given by the high court during an ongoing legal battle between the two sides. The contractors are demanding reduction in licence fee in view of the losses incurred due to the closure of shops.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19However, an understaffed excise department has sought assistance from other departments to run these shops. Collector of Sagar district Deepak Singh said the order was only meant to tide over a temporary problem.“The order was just for a day when there was some initial problem. But none of the employees engaged in the duty are in teaching staff and perhaps none of them visited the liquor shops as well. The said order, too, has been cancelled now.”State BJP spokesperson Rahul Kothari said, “Congress is trying to create confusion among people by misleading them. No teacher was engaged in the sale of liquor and police personnel are supposed to ensure security in the area. None are engaged in the sale of liquor. Congress should apologise to people for telling lies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-slams-mp-govt-for-engaging-teachers-in-liquor-sale-order-cancelled/story-PI3nh9A2NjiS80efU1nfNK.html
12-06-2020||India||Make Covid warriors feel safe: SC||New DelhiUnpaid salaries to doctors and lack of quarantine facilities for heathcare workers engaged in fighting COVID-19 led an anguished Supreme Court on Friday to remark that in a war-like situation, the Centre should travel the extra mile to ensure that the corona warriors are kept safe and happy.The Court was dealing with a petition by a doctor, Arushi Jain who complained of inadequate quarantine facilities across the country. Representing the petitioner, senior advocate KV Vishwanathan informed the Court that as per May 15, 2020 Guidelines issued by the Health Ministry titled “Advisory for Managing Healthcare Workers working in COVID and non-COVID Areas of the Hospital”, only high-risk health care workers or those showing symptoms of COVID-19 need 14-day quarantine. He wondered how such a distinction could be made.The bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, SK Kaul and MR Shah said, “This is a kind of war (against Coronavirus pandemic). You cannot keep soldiers unhappy during a war. Travel the extra mile to make the corona warriors (doctors, nurses, medical staff) feel safe.”Vishwanathan also informed the Court that some doctors working at government and private hospitals have not been paid salaries in full. Noting these facts with concern, the bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who attended the virtual court hearing through videoconferencing, “These issues should not engage our attention. It should be settled by you (Government). ”Mehta submitted that the concerns expressed by the petitioner seem to be ad-hoc, but added that the petitioner could frame a representation highlighting the problems, and that these would be addressed by the government. The bench allowed the petitioner to file a representation highlighting these concerns and make suggestions to the Union Health Secretary. The Centre was directed to consider the same and file a report by Wednesday, the next date of hearing.Earlier, in response to the petition, the Centre filed an affidavit claiming that protecting health care workers was the government’s top-most priority because it expects a surge in the number of coronavirus infections in the coming days. “At some point of time in near future, apart from existing hospitals, large number of temporary makeshift hospitals will have to be created.” It also categorised health care workers as low-risk and high-risk in terms of their potential exposure to the virus. In response to the Centre’s affidavit, the petitioner filed a reply stating that all healthcare workers serving in Covid centres and hospitals, by default, are in the high-risk category due to the infectious nature of this disease. The petitioner requested the Court to add states as parties to the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/make-covid-warriors-feel-safe-sc/story-JXsxvv35MmNfSF6gC4S9OI.html

We stand committed for reservation and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has repeatedly said this,” BJP president JP Nadda said, adding that his party was working to ensure social harmony.Meanwhile, Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan, the leader of National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partner Lok Janshakti Party, demanded that all parties should come together and put all laws related to quota in the ninth schedule of the Constitution, which will preclude any legal challenge.Paswan said reservation, which provides scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, other backward classes (OBCs) and economically backward members of general castes quota in government jobs and educational institutions, may not be a fundamental right but is very much a constitutional right.The Supreme Court refused on Thursday to entertain pleas of various parties challenging the Centre’s decision not to grant 50% reservation to OBCs as per a Tamil Nadu law in medical seats surrendered by the state in the all India quota for undergraduate, postgraduate and dental courses in 2020-21, saying the right to reservation is not a fundamental right.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-committed-to-giving-quota-to-the-weak-says-nadda/story-YqQTsjbWcZ8itDxkq7EytI.html

12-06-2020||India||Military officers hold fifth round of India-China talks||NEW DELHIArmy delegations from India and China, led by major general-ranked officers, on Friday held discussions in eastern Ladakh again to resolve the standoff between border troops as defence minister Rajnath Singh met the military brass here and reviewed the situation along the disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC), two officers said on condition of anonymity.This was the fifth meeting between the two major generals to break the stalemate that began with a violent confrontation between rival patrols near Pangong Tso on the night of May 5-6.The two officers last met at Patrolling Point 14 near the Galwan area on Wednesday as part of continuing efforts to resolve the confrontation that eased slightly with limited disengagement of forces at some LAC hotspots earlier this week.Friday’s meeting between major general Abhijit Bapat, commander of the Karu-based HQs 3 Infantry Division, and his Chinese counterpart went on for nearly five hours, said one of the officers cited above.In Delhi, the defence minister was briefed on the ongoing border scrap and the status of the military-level dialogue to resolve it at a meeting with chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat and the service chiefs, said the second officer cited above.Earlier this week, the two sides began what Indian officials described as a “limited military disengagement” at three hotspots along the LAC – Galwan Valley, Patrolling Point 15 and Hot Springs.The limited disengagement happened after a meeting between Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the People’s Liberation Army, in the South Xinjiang region last Saturday.The focus is now on resolving the situation on the northern bank of Pangong Tso, which has been at the centre of the ongoing border scrap and where troops are still locked in a face-off.Last month’s violent confrontations between Indian and Chinese soldiers in eastern Ladakh and north Sikkim triggered a military build-up on both sides of the LAC that stretched from Ladakh to Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, as reported by Hindustan Times on Friday.The Chinese build-up began immediately after clashes between border troops in Ladakh and Sikkim on May 5-6 and May 9, and predated the June 6 meeting between Lieutenant General Singh and his Chinese counterpart at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC.India and China are continuing diplomatic and military engagements for an “early resolution” of the stand-off between border troops, the external affairs ministry said on Thursday. More military talks are planned in the coming days to ease border tensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/military-officers-hold-fifth-round-of-india-china-talks/story-0cMogRjZ98vkhz3sYkhpnO.html

Almost all silk in India is produced in just five states of Karnataka, Andhra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and J&K. Karnataka produces 70 per cent of the total mulberry silk produced in the country.K C Narayana Gowda, the minister for municipal administration, horticulture and sericulture in the government of Karnataka said a letter had been written to the centre with the above-mentioned requests.Gowda had earlier met with a delegation of sericulturists who complained that they have been affected by the alleged dumping of silk by China.

OIL has contacted North East Institute of Science and Technology (NEIST) to carry out a study to see if there is any induced seismicity due to the blowout,” said an OIL release.Nearly three dozen houses near the well have been razed because of fire. Though its spread has now been contained to the well, the initial flare burned down trees and also impacted the Maguri Motapung wetland, an important bird breeding site.“We started experiencing tremors from Wednesday, a day after the well caught fire. That night the tremors lasted for nearly 10-12 hours and walls of several houses got cracked,” said Hiren Senapati, the president of eco-development committee of Natun Rongagora.“The tremors have been happening intermittently now. Nearly 80% of our villagers are staying in relief camps, the rest who were in their homes are scared to live there because of the tremors...,” said Senapati.According to villagers, the local administration visited Natun Rongagora and took stock of the damage. “It is possible that some tremors had happened in the area close to the well, which witnessed a blowout and subsequently caught fire...“We are in constant touch with OIL authorities. We will be sending out seismology team and equipment to try to evaluate the situation on the ground. From a scientific point of view, we are very keen to look at what are these tremors and analyse its impact,” said G Narahari Sastry, director, NEIST.Meanwhile, efforts were underway to control the fire at the well and plug the blowout. Equipment needed for the purpose have been mobilised, a water reservoir has been dug, and the testing of pumps, engines and auxiliary equipment is under progress, said a release by OIL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tremors-felt-near-assam-gas-blowout-site/story-wora56ST1f8rAxrBH7oA7J.html

Speaking to reporters, the minister for medical education Dr K Sudhakar claimed that there may be a surge in the state around mid-August. “About 97 per cent of the 3,000 cases in the state are asymptomatic. Experts have said that there may be a surge around mid-August and the state is taking all necessary precautionary measures in this regard. We might convert large stadiums into quarantine centres.”The minister claimed that the performance of the government has been good till now in combating the spread of Covid-19 pointing out that while nearly 60% of the total Covid-19 cases are found in 10 cities and despite Bangalore being the 4th most populous, it has managed to successfully contain the spread of the virus.A senior health department official though said that the state government was examining the Delhi model of providing treatment and quarantine at home for asymptomatic patients who are not suffering from any other serious health issues. “While right now we can still handle any surge in cases, going forward we might have to increasingly prioritize and the way to go ahead is the Delhi model of providing a ‘home care package’. Those who have facilities at home and can be isolated there itself, should do so,” said the official who did not want to be named.The state government has already started to identify large facilities like palace grounds, Kanteerava stadium, Bangalore International Exhibition Centre grounds as well as others where temporary hospitals can be created if required at short notice. “We hope that the situation will not come to that but we are gearing up to face any eventuality,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-may-adopt-delhi-model-of-treatment-as-covid-19-cases-continue-to-surge/story-CpdrCTtqk9b8jxfqpZv9bN.html

The Government of India led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bhartiya Janata Party are committed to providing reservation. Our commitment to social justice is unshakeable.

The plea said by allowing the movement of people and economic activities in Delhi, the spread of the virus has severely spiked, resulting in a sharp rise in the number of daily cases.The Centre after four phases of lockdown adding up to more than two months had announced staggered reopening of economic activity in a bid to save livelihoods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-sees-71-deaths-2-137-new-covid-19-cases-take-capital-s-tally-to-36-824/story-ICSmdHI5PtvDMrIcsrZXVM.html
12-06-2020||India||Trump considers suspending H-1B, L-1 and other work visas, could hit Indians hard||The Trump administration is considering suspending several categories of employment-based visas including H-1B for high-skilled foreigners and L-1 for internal company transfers, both very popular with Indian companies with US operations and Indians seeking to work in America.The Wall Street Journal, which first reported this move, said President Donald Trump has not signed off on the proposal, which is part of a package of changes to other work-related visas and authorizations for foreigners yet, and things could change. An executive order is expected in some weeks.The plan also includes ending Obama-era work authorization for spouses of H-1B visa holders cleared for Green Cards, which would impact mostly Indians. The Green Card waiting line is the longest for Indians because of a country-limit of 7% on the number of Green Cards — around 1 million annually — that can be issued to people from any one country.Charges for H-1Bs could also be increased substantially to $20,000 from current $460, as processing fee or some kind of a surcharge.The package seeks, additionally, to end or scale back work authorisation for foreign students, called Optional Practical Training.The move stems from the administration’s efforts to boost employment in the country, which has experienced record job losses caused by the Covid-19 lockdown. The aim is to ensure Americans have the first crack at jobs that become available as the economy rebounds.Also Read: Seattle mayor tells Donald Trump to ‘go back to your bunker’The suspension will extend into the new fiscal year that starts on October 1 and will likely impact new H-1B workers who typically apply then.The White House did not deny the move and a spokesman told the WSJ in a statement, “The administration is currently evaluating a wide range of options, formulated by career experts, to protect American workers and job seekers, especially disadvantaged and underserved citizens—but no decisions of any kind have been made.”President Donald Trump has already suspended all immigration in view of the Covid-19 epidemic, including Green Cards. Non-immigrant work visas were spared, but not any longer if this the package of changes being considered goes through.The United States issues 85,000 H-1B visas every year; 65,000 to foreign workers hired from abroad and 20,000 to foreigners enrolled in US institutions of advanced learning. More than 70% of these visas tend to go to Indians either hired by American companies such as Google, Apple and Microsoft or Indian companies with US operations such as TCS, Infosys and Wipro.Watch: Donald Trump warns against ‘falsely labelling’ decent Americans as racistsThis distinction between those hired abroad and here in the United States has blurred lately as the administration has chosen to hire more foreign students even in the open category to address criticism that the short term visa is being misused to bring foreign workers who are not really high skilled but are cheaper alternatives to Americans. For the same reason, the H-1B visa rejections and request for more paperwork have gone up.L-1 visas for intracompany transfers, which have also been very popular with Indian companies who send executives from India to staff positions for their US operations, have also seen more scrutiny and curbs over a period of time.The tightening of rules for both H-1B and L-1 has routinely been brought up by Indian officials with their US counterparts, but without much success. And now this.The plan has been in the works for some months now and it is expected to be presented to the president for his approval soon.Healthcare professionals and workers are expected to be exempted from the suspension. The move is facing opposition from several quarters, including colleges and universities, the WSJ reported.Some Republican lawmakers have also cautioned against a hasty decision on the matter.“American businesses that rely on help from these visa programs should not be forced to close without serious consideration,” nine Republican senators including Lindsey Graham and John Cornyn wrote in a letter to the president in May. “Guest workers are needed to boost American business, not take American jobs,” the letter added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trump-considers-suspending-h-1b-l-1-and-other-work-visas-could-hit-indians-hard/story-Z7sYkCphk4IHYs9mUzVExN.html

Let them first get as much political experience as I have done and then they can comment.”Former PM Gowda had lost the Lok Sabha polls from Tumkur after he vacated his traditional Hassan seat in favour of his grandson Prajwal Revanna, who is the party’s sole representative in the Lok Sabha. This is 87-year-old Gowda’s second stint in the Rajya Sabha, the first being when he was the PM in 1996.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deve-gowda-87-back-in-rajya-sabha-for-the-first-time-since-1996/story-vGGxA1oHjZwFeT4mzy9kaM.html

A horrific tragedy, resulting from a lethal blend of arrogance and incompetence,” Gandhi said on Twitter.India is firmly on it's way to winning the wrong race. A horrific tragedy, resulting from a lethal blend of arrogance and incompetence. pic.twitter.com/NB2OzXPGCXRahul’s comments come at a time when India crossed 300,000 infections with more than 10,000 cases getting registered daily over the past few days. According to worldometers.com, India is currently the fourth worst-infected country, behind only the USA, Brazil and Russia.On June 6, Rahul Gandhi had questioned centre’s handling of the coronavirus crisis alleging that the lockdown imposed to contain the rise of Covid-19 infections and the subsequent phase-wise unlocking to revive economic activity in the country was ill-timed. He had posted graphs even then to back up his claim that some of the other worst-hit countries in the west had timed their lockdowns and its easing, much better than India.Rahul’s tweet comparing India with Spain, Germany, Italy and UK had drawn flak from the ruling party leaders.Rahul has consistently criticised the government’s response to the current coronavirus induced crisis. On May 26, he had asked the central government to explain the roadmap ahead while suggesting the lockdown had failed its purpose.Rahul’s statements on the issue of lockdown have drawn flak from the government in the past. Union minister Prakash Javadekar had cited data to claim that Rahul’s assessment of the situation was flawed. BJP President JP Nadda, too, had hit out at Rahul on May 30 and claimed that the Congress leader had a limited understanding of “these issues” and his statements were aimed at politicizing issues instead of addressing the crisis.Apart from coronavirus handling, Rahul has also questioned the government over the recent border standoff with China. His suggestion that China could have occupied Indian territory in Ladakh during the recent violent clashes along the LAC in the eastern sector was also rejected by the government. BJP’s MP from Ladakh Jamyang Tsering Namgyal too hit out at Gandhi and said that China had occupied Indian territory of Aksai Chin during the 1962 war and it happened when the Congress ruled at the centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/winning-the-wrong-race-rahul-gandhi-attacks-centre-s-covid-19-containment-strategy/story-SRl36HLrOtqfBDrwkD8EQI.html

Remdesivir, the investigational drug from Gilead Sciences Inc, has been issued an ‘emergency use authorisation’ (EUA) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) to treat patients suffering from severe symptoms of coronavirus, Zydus Cadila said in a statement. Earlier, in May, three domestic pharmaceutical firms Cipla, Jubilant Life Sciences and Hetero entered into non-exclusive licensing agreements with Gilead Sciences Inc for manufacturing and distribution of remdesivir. Zydus Chairman Pankaj Patel said, “We are happy to collaborate with Gilead Sciences and increase the access to this life-saving drug for patients suffering from Covid-19.” In the last decade, Zydus Cadila has been partnering with Gilead Sciences to address various public healthcare challenges and improve global access to affordable need-based therapies, he added. “At this critical juncture, we join hands once again to ensure that no efforts are spared in the fight against this pandemic,” Patel said. As part of the non-exclusive agreement, Zydus will receive the manufacturing know-how from Gilead Sciences Inc to manufacture the API for remdesivir and the finished product and market it in 127 countries, including India, the statement said. “Under the agreement, the licence is royalty free until another pharmaceutical product or vaccine is approved for the treatment or prevention of Covid-19 by the USFDA or EMA (European Medicines Agency) or the WHO (World Health Organization) announcing the end of the public health emergency,” it added. The company will leverage its ability to scale up production to reach patients across India and in 127 countries in Gilead’s global patient solution region, the statement said. In-vitro testing conducted by Gilead has demonstrated that remdesivir is active against the virus that causes Covid-19. The safety and efficacy of remdesivir to treat Covid-19 are being evaluated in multiple ongoing Phase-3 clinical trials, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zydus-cadila-inks-licensing-pact-with-gilead-for-remdesivir/story-d0GL5xJwuRLvg2UxSbIr4M.html

This will be implemented through family members and local bodies which are tasked with providing medicine, food, counselling and other assistance to those who are set to undergo this exercise for their safety.The government has revised the containment zone protocol for targeted implementation of anti-pandemic measures.Out of 20 deaths in the state due to coronavirus, 15 were those of above age 65 and suffering from many other health complications. The health department is planning to detach vulnerable people from the rest and monitor their health indicators to reduce the mortality rate.“We are planning a limited lockdown in a distributed manner based on the community pandemic level. In this case, we can target the affected areas specifically and take containment provisions accordingly. We will notify new containment zones every day,” said state health minister K K Shailaja on Friday, adding the district collectors can decide the extension of lockdown after the mandatory seven-day period.The minister also said from now on home quarantine will be room quarantine and officials will ensure this before a particular patient undergoes it.“We have reports that many in home quarantine are interacting with their family members as usual. This is one of the reasons for secondary infections,” she said, adding the health department will encourage reverse quarantine in a big way.After test rates went up (over 1,02000 now) cases have also increased in the state, the minister added.The government has also roped in private hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients and the details will soon be worked out. So far, only government hospitals were dealing with coronavirus patients in the state. It has also decided to continue full lockdown on all Sundays till the situation improves. Using reverse quarantine, it hopes to keep a check on the community spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-tweaks-containment-plan-uses-reverse-quarantine-to-fight-covid-19/story-JpbANhY4mZJ6D1h0s5HF8K.html
12-06-2020||India||Now, tremors rock villages near Assam’s gas well fire site||After the blowout and fire at Oil India Limited’s (OIL) natural gas well - which claimed lives of two firefighters on Tuesday - local residents in Assam’s Tinsukia district are now experiencing tremors that have resulted in cracks in several homes.Residents of Natun Rongagora village, located 2.5 km from the Baghjan well, which had a blowout on May 27 and caught fire on June 9, are worried their homes could suffer extensive damages if the tremors continue.Nearly three dozen houses near the well have been razed because of fire that has been raging since Tuesday. Though the extent of its spread has now been contained to the well, the initial flare burned down trees and also impacted Maguri Motapung wetland, an important bird breeding site.“We started experiencing tremors from Wednesday, a day after the well caught fire. That night the tremors lasted for nearly 10-12 hours and walls of several houses got cracked,” said Hiren Senapati, president of eco-development committee of Natun Rongagora.The Baghjan well had a blowout, uncontrolled release of gas and oil condensate, while operations were on to locate a new gas reservoir. Efforts are underway to plug the well, it caught fire on June 9.“The tremors have been happening intermittently now. Nearly 80% of our villagers are staying in relief camps, the people in their homes are scared to live there because of the tremors, which could be of 5.0 magnitude,” said Senapati.According to villagers, the local administration visited Natun Rongagora to take stock of the damage. Authorities at OIL have also decided to carry out a study of the induced seismicity (tremors and quakes caused by human activity including oil and gas operations).“There were some reports of tremors in nearby villages. OIL has contacted North East Institute of Science and Technology (NEIST) to carry out a study to see if there is any induced seismicity due to the blowout,” read a statement from the state-run company.The experts from NEIST are trying to ascertain the cause of the tremors. “We are in constant touch with OIL authorities. We will be sending out a seismology team and equipment to try to evaluate the situation on the ground. From a scientific point of view, we are very keen to look at what these tremors are and analyse its impact,” said G Narahari Sastry, director, North East Institute of Science and Technology (NEIST).Besides the tremors, the blowout and subsequent fire has impacted flora and fauna in Maguri Beel, located a few hundred metres away from the well and possibly in the Dibru Saikhowa National Park, around 1 km away from the well.“A group of local naturalists and some experts from Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) went around 700 metres inside Maguri Motapung wetland. We saw many insects and frogs which had died due to the fire,” said Binanda Hatibaruah, a birding tour guide based in Tinsukia.“Maguri is an important habitat for local birds and a nesting site for migratory birds. Because of the oil-like layer on the wetland, migratory birds won’t be able to stay there. We had noticed nests with eggs on the grasslands, which had been abandoned probably after the blowout,” he added.On Friday, HT had reported about a survey by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) which concluded that the blowout had polluted Maguri Motapung and the Lohit river. Meanwhile, efforts are on to control the fire at the well and plug the blowout. Equipment needed for the purpose have been mobilised, a water reservoir dug out and testing of pumps, engines and auxiliary equipment under progress, said a release issued by OIL.Protests by local groups continued to affect production at 68 oil wells and 13 gas wells operated by OIL in the region. According to the company, the protests resulted in the loss of 638 metric tonne of oil on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tremors-rocks-villages-near-assam-s-gas-well-fire-site-people-move-in-camps/story-x9fmTb8GpDsVeSGKqeHhaL.html

In 2018 and 2019, the BSF had arrested 314 and 171 people during the same period.“There was hardly any movement of people in the bordering villages because of the lockdown. Hence it was easier to keep a watch on illegal activities such as infiltration. This has had a negative impact on such cross-border activities,” said SS Guleria, DIG of BSF (South Bengal Frontier).But when it comes to smuggling, the lockdown seems to have had little effect. This year 82 smugglers were arrested in April and May. In 2019, 85 were arrested. In 2018, the number of arrested smugglers was 28.The Indo-Bangladesh border in West Bengal is the longest international border in any state across the country. Out of the 4096.7 km long Indo-Bangla border, West Bengal alone shares 2,216 km with the neighbouring country.Large amounts of narcotics, ganja, phensedyl and FICN have been seized in the last two months compared to the same period of 2018 and 2019.“Now that infiltration has gone down and so has cattle smuggling, our main focus is on smuggling activities. Huge amounts of contraband have been seized and several people have been arrested in the months of April and May,” Guleria said.Data shows that while this year more than one kilo of narcotics was seized in April and May, in 2018 there was no seizure. In 2019 only around 100 grams was seized. This year nearly 600 kilos of ganja have been seized compared to around 100 kilos in 2018 and 59 kilos in 2019. Around 9.8 lakh FICN have been seized this April compared to 96,000 in 2019. BSF officials said that smugglers are resorting to new modus operandi to smuggle contrabands and other items. Patrolling teams have seized at least three consignments in which contrabands were hidden inside cattle carcass. The carcass was found floating down the river.In south Bengal, the border is more than 900 km long out which nearly 60% is riverine.“The trend of hiding smuggled items inside cattle carcass is something new. At least three such consignments have been seized. Earlier this week, a carcass was fished out from the river, in which the smugglers had hidden live fish seeds (baby fishes) packed in polythene packets,” said a top BSF official.The Indo-Bangladesh border, particularly in West Bengal, is also one of the most porous borders. Data placed by the union ministry of home affairs before the Parliament in March 2020 shows that in 2017, 2018 and 2019 security agencies arrested 1175, 1118 and 1351 people along the entire stretch of the Indo-Bangla border in India.With state-borders sealed, no vehicles, except those carrying essential items, were plying during the lockdown. As a result the supply of smuggled items from other states had almost stopped.“Whatever is being smuggled now is the backlog which the smugglers had stored before the lockdown. There could be some local production like ganja and narcotics,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/post-lockdown-infiltration-dips-but-smuggling-continues-across-porus-indo-bangla-border/story-IQpsYZqCTjT6gU0VMh2gvN.html

12-06-2020||India||RJD may field Tej Pratap for MLC polls in Bihar, 17 seats up for grabs||Amid indications that the election commission (EC) may soon announce polls for 17 Legislative Council seats in Bihar, hectic lobbying has begun in both the ruling NDA and Opposition alliance.Of the 17 seats, nine are from the Legislative Assembly quota and eight are from graduates’ and teachers’ constituencies.For the nine Assembly quota seats, names of building construction minister Ashok Choudhary, former acting chairman of the Council Haroon Rashid, whose terms ended last month, are doing the rounds as JD(U) probables.From the Opposition benches, RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav, a MLA from Mahua, could be sent to the Upper House, according to party insiders.As per the numerical strength of the parties in the state assembly, the Janata Dal United, JD(U)-BJP combine can win five seats while Rashtriya Janata Dal(RJD) -Congress can win four. Party officials familiar with the developments said the RJD was expected to stake claim on three seats while leaving one for the Congress. In the ruling alliance, the JD(U) is expected to stake claim on three seats and leave two for the BJP.The party functionaries quoted above said RJD’s top leadership wanted a “safe option” for Tej Pratap Yadav to insulate him from the uncertainty of re-election as MLA from Mahua in the upcoming assembly polls. In case Tej Pratap goes to the Upper House, he will be the third member from RJD’s first family to join the Council. His father Lalu Prasad was a member earlier and his mother Rabri Devi is a current member.The RJD officials referenced above claimed that Tej Pratap has been staying out of controversies recently after being promised a bigger say in the party affairs.State president of the RJD Jagdanand Singh, however, dismissed talks of Tej Pratap being one of the MLC nominees. “This is all baseless. No decision has been taken so far,” he said.The NDA camp seems to have a problem of plenty.“There are far too many aspirants in both JD(U) and BJP, with several former MLAs and MPs vying for a Council seat. It will be a difficult call for the JD(U) president and chief minister Nitish Kumar and BJP’s top leadership,” said a senior JD(U) leader, who didn’t want to be named.The BJP could give a second term to Sanjay Mayunk , whose term as MLC from the Assembly quota ended last month. Others in the fray are former MP Janak Ram and Radha Mohan Sharma, whose terms as MLC ended.“For graduates and teachers constituencies, the sitting MLCs would in all likelihood be given tickets,” said a senior BJP leader on condition of anonymity.According to the BJP leader, IPRD minister Neeraj Kumar and Nawal Kishore Yadav are likely to be re-fielded from Patna graduates’ constituency and Patna teachers’ constituency respectively.The four graduates’ seats are Patna, Darbhanga, Tirhut and Kosi, whereas four teachers’ constituencies are Patna, Saran, Tirhut and Darbhanga.The Council polls were scheduled to be held in April but were deferred due to the Covid-induced lockdown.According to inputs received from officials, the elections may be conducted by the end of this month or early July, when the monsoon session of the state legislature is also expected to be convened. A decision on the date of the election is likely to be taken next week, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rjd-may-field-tej-pratap-for-mlc-polls-in-bihar-17-seats-up-for-grabs/story-XAN3qbZs6lyQs6KgtCjJ5I.html

It has also been decided that barring the sadhus, pilgrims above 55 years of age will not be allowed to undertake the yatra. The yatra, as stated above, will follow the shorter Baltal route and the longer route from Pahalgam will not be used this year for the pilgrimage.“It will be regulated in view of the pandemic and all those undertaking the Yatra must possess Covid-19 negative certificates. The pilgrims will be cross-checked for Covid- 19 infection on entry into J&K before they are allowed to undertake the yatra,” said an official who did not wish to be named.For Coronavirus Live Updates“In a first of its kind initiative, the SASB is also trying to telecast the aarti live from the cave shrine, both in the morning and the evening, for the devotees,” he said.Another official said that there was also a possibility to allow the yatra only through helicopter trips.The J&K lieutenant governor’s principal secretary and CEO of SASB, Bipul Pathak said that the board is yet to take a decision on these issues.“When it is decided, the media will come to know,” Pathak said.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The Amarnath yatra was originally scheduled to begin on June 23 through the twin tracks of Pahalgam in Anantnag district and Baltal in Ganderbal district and end on August 3 on the day of Shravan Purnima (Raksha Bandhan).Last year too, the yatra was cut short following intelligence inputs of terror threats ahead of centre’s move to scrap Article 370 that assigned special status to Jammu and Kashmir. In 2018, the pilgrimage was held for 60 days.Every year thousands of pilgrims trek to the shrine either through the traditional and longer 45-km long Pahalgam route or the shorter 14 km route through Baltal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarnath-yatra-only-2-000-pilgrims-likely-to-be-allowed-per-day-starting-july-21/story-BFfiFLKiC2yU1lsAnbHpkM.html

Representing the petitioner, senior advocate KV Vishwanathan informed the Court that as per May 15, 2020 guidelines issued by the Health Ministry titled “Advisory for Managing Healthcare Workers working in Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 Areas of the Hospital”, only high-risk healthcare workers or those showing symptoms of the disease needed 14-day quarantine. He wondered how such a distinction could be made.The bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, SK Kaul and MR Shah said, “This is a kind of war (against the coronavirus pandemic). You cannot keep soldiers unhappy during a war. Travel the extra mile to make the corona warriors (doctors, nurses and medical staff) feel safe.”ALSO READ | ‘I salute corona warriors for risking their lives to save others’: Amit Shah at West Bengal Jan Samvad RallyVishwanathan also informed the court that doctors working at government hospitals have not been paid wages. The situation is similar in several private hospitals where there has been a wage cut.Noting these facts with concern, the bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who attended the virtual court hearing through videoconferencing, “These issues should not engage our attention. It should be settled by you (Government). ”Mehta submitted that the concerns expressed by the petitioner seemed to be ad-hoc. However, he informed the court that the petitioner can frame a representation highlighting their problems and the same will be addressed by the government.The bench allowed the petitioner to file a representation highlighting their concerns and suggestions to the Union Health Secretary. The Centre was directed to consider the same and file a report in court by Wednesday, the next date of hearing.Earlier, in response to the petition, the Centre had filed an affidavit claiming that conserving healthcare workforce was top most priority as the Government expected a surge in the number of coronavirus infections in the coming days.“At some point of time in the near future, apart from existing hospitals, a large number of temporary make-shift hospitals will have to be created in order to accommodate Covid-19 patients requiring admission, medical care and treatment,” the Health Ministry affidavit stated.In response to the Centre’s affidavit, the petitioner filed a reply stating that all healthcare workers serving in Covid-19 dedicated centres and hospitals, by default are under “high risk” category due to the infectious nature of this disease. The petitioner even requested the court to add states as parties to this case since the Centre had claimed that public health is a state subject.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-war-so-travel-extra-mile-to-keep-corona-warriors-happy-sc-tells-centre/story-1i1GVGsLzGueEloYxiuokJ.html
12-06-2020||India||Kota: Rare case of meningoencephalitis detected in Covid-19 deceased patient||A rare case of meningoencephalitis, an inflammation of the brain and its surrounding protective membranes, has been detected in a young patient, who died of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Kota, but doctors are yet to ascertain whether it was caused by Sars-CoV-2, which causes the disease.The authorities at the Government Medical College in Kota, which has been converted into a dedicated Covid-19 facility, are sending the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of the patient to Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) to find out if the viral infection caused meningoencephalitis in the deceased patient.Earlier, a 17-year-old boy from Baran was admitted to a private hospital in Kota on June 3, and three days later he tested Covid-19 positive and died on the same day at the Government Medical College.Dr. Vijay Sardana, the principal of the Government Medical College, Kota, and also the head of the neurology department, said: “The Covid-19 patient was shifted to our hospital on June 6, but he was brought brain dead and expired a few hours after he was admitted.“We had taken the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample of the patient and conducted the Covid-19 test, but it didn’t show any trace of the Sars-CoV-2 infection. However, the patient didn’t have any prior history of a cerebral condition. We’re sending the CSF sample to NIV in Pune to detect the virus, which caused meningoencephalitis. We’ll report the case to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and also study it,” he said.Sardana said only three-four cases of meningoencephalitis have been reported in Covid-19 patients from countries such as Pakistan, China, and Japan so far. India is yet to report a single case of meningoencephalitis in a Covid-19 patient.Meningoencephalitis resembles both meningitis and encephalitis. Meningoencephalitis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoan or as a secondary sequel of other inflammations due to Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kota-rare-case-of-meningoencephalitis-detected-in-covid-19-deceased-patient/story-DQsUgxjZcLTjnddWeHdfrI.html

12-06-2020||India||Nepal-India border tensions rise, one killed. Explained in 10 points||One Indian farmer has been killed and at least three more are injured in firing by Nepal police during an altercation with Indian farmers across the border at Sitamarhi district in Bihar. The incident comes at a time of continued tension between the two south Asian neighbours over conflicting territorial claims. Here’s a roundup of the latest incident and the geo political background in which it is happening. 1. 25-years old farmer Vikesh Kumar Rai was killed and two others, Umesh Ram and Uday Thakur received bullet injuries while working in an agricultural field in firing by Nepal security forces, said locals. Another person Lagan Rai is said to have been detained by the Nepali police across the Lalbandi-Janki Nagar border in Pipra Parsain panchayat under Sonebarsha police station in Bihar’s Sitamarhi district.2. According to another account by the director general of Sahastra Seema Bal (SSB) Kumar Rajesh Chandra, quoted by ANI, the incident took place at around 8:40 am on Friday when a family going to Nepal was stopped and asked to return by Nepali security personnel at the border. This he says led to a verbal altercation.3. Chandra told ANI that the Nepal security personnel fired around 15 rounds of ammunition including 10 in the air. He also made it clear that the firing happened inside Nepal’s territory and not on the Indian side of the border, a fact also corroborated by additional director general of police (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar.4. The officer said that the Nepali security had detained one person—identified as farmer Lagan Rai by one account-- and Indian forces were engaging their Nepali counterparts in talks to have him released to ensure that issues don’t escalate further. The external affairs ministry has not given any immediate reaction to the development. The district magistrate and the superintendent of police of Sitamarhi have rushed to the spot.5. The incident comes amid India’s sharp disagreement with Nepal’s move to revise its map laying claim to Indian territories of Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani, which fall in Uttarakhand state. Nepal’s lower house has voted for a constitutional amendment to include these territories in its official map despite India’s objections. Nepal’s parliament is holding a special meeting tomorrow to complete the amendment process.6. The border issue was first raised by Nepal PM KP Sharma Oli after India formally opened the 80-km road to Lipulekh Pass for Kailash Mansarovar pilgrims in the month of May.7. India has described Nepal’s map move as a ‘unilateral act’ not based on historical facts or evidence and has asked Kathmandu to ‘refrain’ from bringing about an ‘unjust’ and ‘artificial enlargement of territorial claims’.8. Following the map move, Nepal has increased troops presence on the border with India. The two countries share an open border of 1,880 kms. Nepal had closed its international borders on March 22 as a containment measure against the coronavirus pandemic.9. Several experts see the new map as attempt by the Nepal PM to galvanise public support by whipping up ultra-nationalistic sentiments. Some experts have also pointed to China’s close ties with Nepal’s ruling communist party to add another perspective to the issue.10. India has been supportive of all neighbours including Nepal which was supplied with 25 tonnes of medical aid, including paracetamol and hydroxychloroquine tablets, test kits and other supplies to aid in the fight against coronavirus spread. India has also taken care to ensure that the supply of essential goods to Nepal is not disrupted despite the lockdown on both sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-india-border-tensions-rise-one-killed-explained-in-10-points/story-mf3V7E8whyjFsiPt760U1H.html

At the time the lockdown was imposed on March 25, the doubling rate of Covid-19 cases was 3.4 days, it said.Amid a spurt in cases, the cabinet secretary held a meeting chief secretaries, health and urban development secretaries of all states through a video link and they were asked to also pay special attention to the emerging epicentres of Covid-19 cases and undertake stringent containment measures to check the contagion, the ministry said.With 10,956 new coronavirus infections in 24 hours till Friday 8 am, India’s Covid-19 caseload reached 2,97,535 while the death toll rose to 8,498 with a record single-day spike of 396 fatalities, according to the Health Ministry data.“The doubling rate/time continues to improve and has increased from 3.4 days at the beginning of lockdown to 17.4 days currently,” the ministry said.During the meeting with the cabinet secretary, the states were advised to focus on containment, testing and tracing, upgrading health infrastructure, clinical management and community engagement for effective management of Covid-19.   Undertaking active house-to-house surveillance in containment zones was also stressed upon citing it was critical for early identification of cases. The states were requested to expedite upgradation of hospital infrastructure to manage Covid-19 cases as per projections while ensuring sufficient logistics, and trained human resources.Timely referrals, based on symptoms and improving clinical practices with the help of Centres of Excellence in collaboration with AIIMS, Delhi, was also stressed at the meeting.States were requested to undertake extensive community outreach to encourage social distancing and promotion of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour in the community at all times, the health ministry said. Apart from improvement in the doubling rate, it said the recovery rate of patients has also become better.“Recovery rate of Covid positive cases continues to increase and is currently stands at 49.47 per cent,” the ministry said.

Amar, who holds a diploma in hotel management, returned home after he lost his job at a luxury resort in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, as the viral outbreak has battered the economy, especially the hospitality sector among others.The village, which is located in the Belacoba forest range under the Rajganj police station in Jalpaiguri district, is situated around 400 metres away from the tower that doesn’t have an electricity connection.Forest department officials said it would get tough for the youth to live on the watchtower while the onset of monsoon in north Bengal was declared on Friday amid a forecast for heavy rains over the weekend. “The youth will undergo Covid-19 tests. If they test negative, they’ll be allowed entry to the village after 14 days,” said Hari Bahadur Bhujel, Amar’s uncle.Forest department officials unsuccessfully tried to prevail over the adamant villagers and convince them that keeping the youth on the watchtower is both risky and illegal.Dipak Roy Pradhan, the beat officer of Sikharpur range, said, “We tried to persuade the villagers to see reason, but they were adamant. On Thursday night, a herd of 17 elephants destroyed 200 mounds of paddy on the eastern side of the village. Fortunately, the tower is located on the northern side.”Sanjay Dutta, the ranger of Belacoba forest, said, “People have lost humanity. The watchtower is 25 feet high and the top platform measures around eight square feet. It’s dangerous to live there.”Amar said, “The management of the resort didn’t renew my contract. I came home after one and a half years. I never imagined that I’d be forced to stay on a watchtower in my own village.”He, however, wants to make the most out of a grave situation. “We’re hurt but we plan to use this opportunity to help the villagers. If we see wild elephants approaching the village, we’ll drive them away by using the battery-operated searchlights our family has given us.” There have been several unusual makeshift quarantine centres across the country to accommodate migrant returnees, but watchtower appears to be the first instance.Earlier, seven men in West Bengal’s Purulia district spent days on a treetop after they returned from Chennai on March 24, a day before nationwide lockdown restrictions were imposed.They stayed on a machan, a makeshift wood and bamboo platform set up by villagers, in a bid to save themselves from wild elephants.At Habibpur in Malda district, Niranjan Haldar (65) lived in a small country boat in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/north-bengal-brothers-forced-to-be-in-quarantine-on-watchtower-in-elephant-corridor/story-b8GHR44z6iONDX4okbABiM.html

We shall engage reputed international consultants for the design and construction,” he said.The chief minister said the Bhogapuram airport would result in the rapid development of north coastal Andhra. He said the government would plan construction of expressways from Bhogapuram to Visakhapatnam to enable the people to reach the port city faster.“The government is also planning to construct a metro rail network in Visakhapatnam that would be extended up to the Bhogapuram airport, so that it would reduce the burden on road travel. We shall complete this road infrastructure at the earliest,” the Andhra CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gmr-signs-pact-with-andhra-govt-to-develop-greenfield-airport-at-bhogapuram/story-HlSW3JvB1Yp6d0URZqhueP.html
12-06-2020||India||J&K: Congress demands security for all sarpanches and panchayat members||The Congress party has demanded security for all sarpanches and panchayat members in Jammu and Kashmir, saying they are vulnerable to attacks by terrorists.The demand came days after the Congress sarpanch from Lukbhawan in south Kashmir, Ajay Pandita, was killed by terrorists on Monday afternoon. Pandita was the second Congress sarpanch to be killed by terrorists in the region in the past two years.The Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress president, Ghulam Ahmad Mir, said the party has been demanding for the past few months that the government should provide security to vulnerable panchayat members. “But nobody bothers,” he said.“After the killing of Ajay Pandita, we have been demanding security for panches and sarpanches on a daily basis, but still nothing has been done,” he said, adding Pandita had himself made requests for security to the government several times.“Many panchayat members and other political leaders are facing threats but they still haven’t been given security. We will be writing to the Central government after a meeting,” Mir said.After the Central government scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status on August 5 last year, many mainstream political leaders were arrested and the security of several leaders, especially those from the Congress, was downgraded, he said.“Though I’m a former minister and legislator and also Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee president, my security was downgraded. In Jammu, I don’t have any security and the same is the case with other leaders of the Congress and other mainstream political parties,” he added.The BJP too demanded security for panchayat members soon after Pandita’s killing.“We have been demanding security for panchayat members from a long time, but nothing happened,” said BJP spokesman and sarpanch Altaf Thakur.Director general of police Dilbag Singh has blamed the Hizbul Mujahideen for the killing of Pandita and said the terrorists responsible for the attack had been identified.However, the Jammu and Kashmir government hasn’t said whether security will be provided to panchayat members. Panchayat elections were held in the region in 2018 and the two prominent mainstream political parties – the National Conference and Congress – had boycotted the polls. Many panchayats are still vacant as no politician had filed nominations for these posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-congress-demands-security-for-all-sarpanches-and-panchayat-members/story-b6zqt5ldFpHQLgHhcsmhgL.html

The Congress initially dithered and denied any meeting between the two, even terming it fake news. However, they did admit later that Rahul Gandhi had met the envoy.Subsequently, Gandhi tweeted saying, “It is my job to be informed on critical issues. I met the Chinese ambassador, ex-NSA, Congress leaders from NE & the Bhutanese ambassador.” Ravi Shankar Prasad posted the same tweet from 2017 to take a swipe at the Congress leader.“RahulGandhi is asking the Prime Minister to share in public facts about sensitive China border issues. I think Mr.Gandhi has a parallel information system in place. Did he not meet the Chinese envoy during the Doklam crisis? Denied it initially but accepted it after public outcry,” said Prasad. RahulGandhi is asking the Prime Minister to share in public facts about sensitive China border issues.

Meanwhile The PM is absolutely silent and has vanished from the scene,” he tweeted.According to people familiar with developments, China has begun withdrawing its soldiers from three hotspots along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. India too has reciprocated by pulling back its forces deployed in those pockets as both sides have stepped up efforts to resolve a month-long tense border confrontation.On Thursday, the Ministry of External Affairs said India and China are continuing with their diplomatic and military engagements in an effort to reduce border tensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-china-union-minister-digs-up-old-rahul-gandhi-tweet-to-mount-attack/story-o2soq4T0m7jV4nOQK9oYNP.html

Scheduled to be held in the first quarter of next year, the Mahakumbh in 2010 had attracted 50 million pilgrims and this time, before the epidemic, officials had expected that over 120 million pilgrims would participate in the fair next year.Keeping in mind the Covid-19 situation, the apex body of the Akhadas---Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad- has stated that it is not averse to holding the Kumbh mela in a restrictive manner with only a selected lot of Akhada saints allowed to take part in the fair, adhering to social distancing norms.Akhada Parishad is of the view that the foremost priority of the government should be to hold the Kumbh in a proper way if the situation turns normal, but in case such a situation arises wherein the coronavirus spread threatens the Kumbh pilgrimage then it should be held in a restrictive manner and at a small level.“Be it Mughal or British era or post-independence, the Kumbh mela has been held at the same date decided as per astrological calculations. Kumbh 2021 will also be held at an auspicious time decided by astrologers but as coronavirus spread has now touched the 10,000 positive patients per day mark, in special circumstances we are ready to carry out the fair in a small and ritualistic-symbolic manner only,” Mahant Hari Giri Maharaj, general secretary of Akhada Parishad said.To ensure hassle-free hosting of the Mahakumbh Mela, Akhada Parishad will also organise a three-day major worship ritual across the country from June 21.These rituals are being conducted for the successful hosting of the Mahakumbh and the eradication of coronavirus from the planet.Akhada Parishad has also cautioned all the temple-ashram management committees to close respective temples for pilgrims if they come across any violation of social distancing and preventive measures by devotees. Additional Kumbh Mela officer Lalit Narayan Mishra said that the mela administration is ensuring time-bound completion of work related to the Kumbh and readying for the mega fair as per the schedule.Mishra pointed out that “as still more than six months are left for the mega fair, the mela administration is ensuring the best possible facilities for pilgrims who come for the Kumbh.”Under the Kumbh Mela budget, an amount of about Rs 350 crore has been sanctioned for various infrastructural work. These have a deadline of November 2020.Religious scholar Shiv Charan Naudiyal pointed out that whether the coronavirus gets contained or remains stable, pilgrims will arrive for Kumbh and the holy Ganga dip as faith transcends all hurdles and boundaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mahakumbh-2021-may-not-see-mass-participation-owing-to-covid-19-akhada-parishad/story-ZyM0sB78n5fD0pPQnwn3iI.html

Uttar Pradesh, which is India’s most populous state, accounts for only 12,088 of the national tally.UP chief secretary Amit Mohan Prasad said 7,609 patients had fully recovered from Covid-19 infection in the state and had been sent home following treatment.“A total of 7,609 residents have been cured of the disease and they have returned home. Our recovery rate has improved to 60.31%,” Prasad was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The national recovery rate is close to 50 %, which means 147,194 infected people have been cured of the virus so far leaving 141,842 active cases.On the testing front, the state’s most senior bureaucrat claimed that Uttar Pradesh had reached a milestone on Thursday by testing more than 15,000 samples in a day. He added that it aims to reach the 20,000 tests-a-day mark by the end of this month.“15,607 samples were tested in the state yesterday. The target is to test 20,000 samples daily by the end of June. A total of 4 lakh 19 thousand samples have been tested in state’s different labs,” Prasad said.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesCovid-19 positive cases had risen in Uttar Pradesh in the last month due to many returning migrants –arriving from other hotspots in Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu among others—bringing the disease to the state with them.A few days ago, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath had told chief editor of Hindi news daily Hindustan that his government will not let even a single coronavirus patient fend for himself. He added that every infected patient in the state was being treated free of cost at government hospitals in the state.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Agra, Noida, Lucknow and Ghaziabad are amongst the worst affected districts in the state and the state administration has told the Supreme Court that it intends to continue restrictions on movement between Delhi and these two neighbouring districts of Uttar Pradesh to prevent an exponential rise in positive cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-s-recovery-rate-at-over-60-is-almost-10-more-than-the-national-average/story-ltkzloTKIFWQlSAtoE5xyN.html

The Centre, after four phases of lockdown adding up to more than two months, had announced staggered reopening of economic activity in a bid to save livelihoods.ALSO READ | Plea in High Court seeks reimposition of lockdown in DelhiThe Delhi high court’s order came while dismissing with a penalty of Rs 20,000 a public interest litigation (PIL) by a law student challenging the May 30 order of the Centre by which the lockdown was extended only in containment zones which had a high concentration of coronavirus positive patients.The reopening of economic activity, shops, markets, sports stadiums and the like was done in a phased manner only outside containment zones. Inter-state travel too had been permitted in a phased manner by the Union government.A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramanium Prasad said the government is expected to remain cognizant of the situation and evaluate it closely and if it is found that the rate of coronavirus infection is going up, they can always review their decision and impose curbs, depending upon the prevalent situation.The petition had sought imposition of a lockdown on grounds that during the earlier lockdown period, the doubling rate of Covid-19 cases was low. The plea said by allowing the movement of people and economic activities in the country, “The spread of the virus has severely spiked, resulting in a sharp rise in the number of daily cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-slaps-rs-20-000-fine-on-student-who-challenged-lifting-of-lockdown/story-N8o6AEzzrTMuFAbodi829J.html

12-06-2020||India||‘In war, you don’t make soldiers unhappy’: SC on non-payment of salaries to doctors||“In war, you do not make soldiers unhappy. Travel extra mile and channel some extra money to address their grievances,” the Supreme Court said on Friday taking serious note of non-payment of salary and lack of proper accommodation to doctors engaged in fight against Covid-19. The courts should not be involved in the issue of non-payment of salary to health care workers and government should settle the issue, it said.The top court was hearing a plea by a doctor, who alleged that front line healthcare workers engaged in fight against Covid-19 are not being paid salaries or their salaries are being cut or delayed.The doctor also questioned the Centre’s new SOP making their 14-day quarantine non-mandatory. “In war, you do not make soldiers unhappy. Travel extra mile and channel some extra money to address grievances. Country cannot afford to have dissatisfied soldiers in this war which is being fought against Corona,” said a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, S K Kaul and MR Shah. Also read | Indian-origin doctor performs first lung transplant for Covid-19 patient in USSolicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said that if there are better suggestions coming forward, they can be accommodated. The bench said that there are reports coming that many areas doctors are not being paid. “We saw report that doctors went on strike. In Delhi, some doctors have not been paid for past three months. These are concerns that should have been taken care off. It should not require court intervention.” The bench further said, “You (Centre) need to do more. Must make sure their concerns are addressed”. The bench posted the matter for further hearing next week. On June 4, the Centre had told the top court that a “large number” of make-shift hospitals will have to be built in the near future to accommodate the constant rise in the number of newly infected people. The Centre also contended that though hospitals are responsible for implementing the Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) activities, the final responsibility lies with the health care workers to protect themselves from Covid-19. It further said mandatory quarantine for 14 days after the duty of healthcare workers of 7/14 days is “not justified and warranted”. “It is most respectfully submitted that number of cases of Covid-19 are constantly increasing and at some point of time in near future, apart from existing hospitals, large number of temporary make-shift hospitals will have to be created in order to accommodate Covid-19 patients requiring admission, medical care and treatment,” the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said in an affidavit. The affidavit was filed on a plea by Arushi Jain who questioned the Centre’s new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of May 15 for front line Covid-19 healthcare workers by which it ended the 14-day mandatory quarantine for them. The ministry in its reply affidavit had said healthcare workers (HCW) are properly protected by Personal Protective Equipments (PPE) in workplace settings and carry no additional risk to their families or children. It had said grievances raised by the petitioner alleging infirmities in the May 15 guidelines of the health ministry are completely presumptuous, vacuous, ill-founded and sans any empirical or medical evidence.Justifying its advisory and SOPs, the health ministry said it is a step in the right direction and that the guidelines emphasise the role of taking adequate preventive measures by all health care workers in the hospital setting against the likelihood of contracting infection at their work place.On April 8, the apex court had observed that the doctors and medical staff are the “first line of defence of the country” in the battle against Covid-19 pandemic, and directed the Centre to ensure that appropriate PPEs are made available to them for treating coronavirus patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-war-you-don-t-make-soldiers-unhappy-sc-on-non-payment-of-salaries-to-doctors/story-ThVi1CVp3I8Tn7Ing2TcKN.html

We are taking up this matter strongly from the court to the Election Commission. The ruling party cannot intimidate us,” said Singhvi.Fearing poaching, the Congress had shifted its legislators to various resorts in Gujarat in the one last week, dividing them in zone-wise groups. While some MLAs gathered in Rajkot in Saurashtra, few others were in Abu Road in Rajasthan.Recently, three Congress MLAs - Brijesh Merja, Akshay Patel and Jitu Chaudhary - has resigned, diminishing the chances of the Congress winning the second Rajya Sabha seat as its tally in the 182-member House now stands at 65.Five Congress legislators - Somabhai Patel, Praveen Maru, JV Kakadia, Mangal Gavit and Pradyuman Singh Jadeja - had resigned earlier in March.The total strength of the Gujarat assembly now stands at 172. The ruling BJP has 103 legislators, the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) two and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) one.

12-06-2020||India||‘Transactional and episodic’: Rahul Gandhi on India-US ties||The partnership between India and the United States worked because both were tolerant nations but sadly that DNA of tolerance has now disappeared, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said on Friday.In a video conversation with former US under secretary of state, Nicholas Burns, Gandhi also said the Indo-US relationship, which used to be a partnership earlier, now seems to have become “very transactional and episodic.”“I think why our partnership works is because we are tolerant systems. You mentioned that you are an immigrant nation. We are a very tolerant nation. Our DNA is supposed to be tolerant. We are supposed to accept new ideas,” the Congress leader said while responding to Burns who insisted that both India and the United States shared many traits.“We are supposed to be open but the surprising thing is that that DNA that open DNA is sort of disappearing. I mean I say this with sadness that I don’t see that level of tolerance that I used to see. I don’t see it in the United States and I don’t see it in India,” Gandhi said.Describing the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody as “horrible”, Burns said the people in the US were protesting over his killing.“We are protesting and that is our right. And millions of Americans are protesting for our rights the way you have in India. And India and the US share many traits as we both have liberated ourselves from British in different years…. The US is in a deep political and existential crisis that has gripped us all,” he said, adding the US adopted the idea of protesting in a non-violent way from Mahatma Gandhi.The former US diplomat further said India and the United States can work together not to fight an “authoritarian” China but to make it observe the rule of law.“I think that India and the US can be working together. Not as you say not to fight China, but to make it observe the rule of law as we try to live together in this world,” he said.Burns served in the US government for 27 years and as a career foreign service officer, he was under secretary of state for political affairs during 2005-08, the state department’s third-ranking official when he led negotiations on the India-US civil nuclear agreement.For his part, Gandhi said the Indo-US relationship has now become “very transactional” and “episodic” and no longer a partnership it used to be earlier.“A relationship that used to be very broad -- education, defence, healthcare, multiple fronts -- has sort of focused down mainly on defence,” Gandhi said.Burns said not just the governments of the US and India, but their societies were very closely intertwined and that is a great strength.“If you think that one of the challenges we face is the coming power of authoritarian countries. I mentioned two before, China and Russia. We never want to fight, we don’t want war but we want to preserve our way of life and we want to preserve our positions in the world,” he said.Burns said the relationship between India and the US is important and the two governments should combine forces to promote human freedom, democracy and rule of people in the world.“I think that is a powerful idea that Indians and Americans can bring together to the rest of the world. Again, you know, we are not looking for a conflict with China, but we are waging, in a way, a battle of ideas with China,” he added.Gandhi also hit out at the divisions prevailing in both the countries, saying they weaken nations.“When you divide African Americans, Mexicans and other people in the United States, so you divide Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs in India, you’re weakening the structure of the country. But then the same people who weaken the structure of the country say that they are the nationalists,” the former Congress chief said.The dialogue was a part of Gandhi’s series of video conversations with global and Indian thought leaders to discuss the Covid-19 crisis and its consequences on the Indian economy.In the past, the Congress chief interacted with former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan, Nobel Laureate Professor Abhijit Banerjee, Harvard Professor Ashish Jha, Swedish epidemiologist Johan Giesecke and Bajaj Auto managing director Rajiv Bajaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/transactional-and-episodic-rahul-gandhi-on-india-us-ties/story-SdH5yOLTJL77HcQxS39jiI.html

The employee could be further seen putting the body inside a van.Local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers made claims before the media that the van carried several decomposed corpses and the stench was unbearable. They also said that they objected to the cremation and made several videos.The BJP and Communist Party of India (Marxist) claimed that the corpses could be those of Covid-19 victims. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and the health department, however, produced records which showed that unclaimed bodies lying at hospital morgues were supposed to be cremated at the Garia crematorium since the Dhapa dumping ground, where such unclaimed bodies are cremated round the year, has been reserved for Hindus dying of Covid-19. An order to this effect was passed by KMC’s chief health officer on May 29. HT has seen the documents.But West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh alleged the corpses were of Covid-19 patients. “The government tried to hide the truth. Apparently, the bodies were burnt with acid,” Ghosh claimed.“We want to know the identity and addresses of these dead people,” said CPI(M) legislator Sujan Chakraborty. He even wrote a letter to Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim.Hakim said that the corpses were unclaimed and had been lying in a government hospital morgue. “The KMC issued an order on May 29, saying unclaimed bodies would be cremated at the Garia crematorium and the Dhapa crematorium used exclusively for corpses of Hindu victims of Covid-19,” said Hakim.Professor Saibal Mukherjee, principal, NRS Medical College and Hospital, wrote a letter to Kolkata Police Commissioner Anuj Sharma on Thursday evening. He said the bodies were related to cases registered in different police stations and none of these people were Covid-19 patients. “The subject of the video is fake and you may please take necessary action in this regard,” Prof Mukherjee wrote to Sharma.The controversy, however, continued on Friday.“Issue is not whether the dead bodies were Covid ones! That is matter of probe. Issue-How human bodies can be so shamelessly dragged! Being treated worse than animals. To those engaging in diversion - Search your soul and conscience and imagine dead body was related to you!” Dhankhar tweeted on Friday morning. Issue is not whether the dead bodies were Covid ones !

Virtual admission about callous handling of dead bodies promising procedure will be stream lined. Rather than booking those responsible for such inhuman criminality, police is being misused to ‘teach a lesson’ to those who exposed it,” the governor said in another tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/search-your-soul-bengal-governor-on-video-of-mistreatment-of-decomposed-bodies/story-9U88ASpEX5L2jJhSbFY44O.html
12-06-2020||India||How Karan unlocked the lockdown blues!||Actor Karan Aanand, who played an antagonist in the film ‘Baby’, has tried his best to make the best use of being in a lockdown. With Unlock 0.1 on, he came up his first short film based on the subject that was widely debated during the entire lockdown period.“The issue of not paying the domestic helps and labourers has been vastly discussed in the last few months. The subject touched me in many ways and I am thrilled with the phenomenal response it has received, clocking 1.2 lac views in just two days along with lot of appreciation,” said the UPite over phone.The film was shot in May end during lockdown 5.0, telling more about his venture Karan said, “Though it’s a small film but still it was a cumbersome task to do. Also my main aim was to let the message reach far and wide. I was shooting at my house in Lokhandwala while my co-actor Preeti Verma shot her part at her place. We have shot the film with our personal phones. It took five days to shoot my part.” The story was developed by Bobby Khan who also happens to be a virtual director the film. “Shantanu Srivastava, producer for my next film, suggested me do a short film based on the current scenario. Bobby’s script had many layers — frustration of females in absence of house help, plight of daily labourers, job insecurity and humanitarian crisis. Since this was my first short film, I wanted to prove it to all the directors and top-makers, I have worked with that I can’t be expert like them but I too have a small maker in me. After all I can’t afford to go wrong after being part of films like ‘Baby’, ‘Gundey’, ‘Kick’ and ‘Rangeela Raja’,” he adds.His film ‘Azad Maidan’ was supposed to start in April in Mumbai which is now postponed. “When lockdown happened like everyone else I was too all confused. I had realised that I need to remain positive and make use of this time. Being a black belt holder, I started my martial arts training again besides dance, body-weight training and yoga. I kept my mind occupied also got more into meditation to explore my spiritual self,”Karan got two films in this period. “I have signed for a digital film to be shot in Mumbai, Surat and Goa probably in October or November. It has two male leads. There is another film to be shot in and around Lucknow in April next year,” Karan shared.His last visit to hometown Prayagraj was during Diwali. “I want to go back to Sangam city as soon as possible to meet my parents and siblings. As soon as things get a bit normal, I want to be with them for sometime before work restarts,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/how-karan-unlocked-the-lockdown-blues/story-HVoVpWp0Vh9j73YLJr4nNK.html
12-06-2020||India||No decision on fresh lockdown, says Maharashtra CM||Amid speculation about the Maharashtra government imposing a fresh Covid-19 lockdown following a spike in infections, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray clarified on Friday no such decision has been made by his government. He appealed to the people to strictly follow existing Covid-19-related restrictions to keep the spread of the Coronavirus in check.As messages made the rounds of social media platforms about the state government planning to impose a fresh lockdown from next week, there was confusion and fear among citizens.Responding to these concerns, Thackeray’s office issued a statement on Friday morning that made it clear no such decision had been made by the state government.“There are rumours being spread through social media and reports on some channels that the state government has taken a decision to impose lockdown by shutting down all the shops and commercial establishments. We have not taken any such decision,” the statement said.“Any such reports create confusion among the people. Spreading such false news is violation of the law and should not be transmitted without confirmation.”Thackeray had on Wednesday said that though there was no decision on a fresh lockdown, the authorities may be forced to impose one if people don’t follow Covid-19-related restrictions.He had said, “The threat of Covid-19 has not passed, it still persists. As we continue to battle the pandemic, we cannot put the brakes on the wheels of the economy. We were shocked looking at the crowd on the first day.“Outdoor physical activities are permitted for your good health and not to spoil it. People will have to keep physical distance. The government is evaluating the situation. If we feel that the lifting of lockdown is life-threatening, then we will be forced to impose the lockdown again.”Thackeray, in his statement on Friday, said citizens shouldn’t take undue advantage of the easing of curbs by the government.“Lifting of the lockdown norms does not mean people are allowed to step out, leading to crowding at public places [that] could prove hazardous for health. Maintaining social distancing, masking the face and sanitisation at regular intervals should be adopted now as part of the lifestyle,” he said, adding everybody should follow self-discipline for their own health and that of their loved ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-decision-on-fresh-lockdown-says-maharashtra-cm/story-3kr7BmQKsffZaD69uyx5lM.html

12-06-2020||India||Covid-19 patients treated worse than animals, bodies found in garbage: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Friday took a strong view of the treatment meted out to Covid-19 patients and dead bodies in government hospitals across the country, describing the situation as deplorable and worse than what animals would have to suffer. Taking cognisance of media reports, a three-judge bench sought detailed status reports from four states - Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal - regarding the conditions in hospitals.“Covid-19 patients are treated worse than animals. In one case, a dead body was found in garbage,” the bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan remarked.The state of Delhi came in for heavy criticism from the bench, with the court pointing out the conditions in hospitals as well the reduced testing for Covid-19. The top court also noted that patients are running from pillar to post to get themselves admitted even though a large number of beds in government hospitals are lying vacant.Also Watch | ‘Send migrants home within 15 days, drop cases’: Key points from SC order Taking note of a media report, the court highlighted how dead bodies of Covid-19 patients were lying unattended in the lobby and waiting area of Delhi’s Lok Nayak Jai Prakash hospital.Reminding states, the top court said that governments are duty bound to ensure adequate infrastructure in hospitals and also that Covid-19 patients are attended to by health workers.Former union law minister and senior counsel Ashwini Kumar had written to the CJI on June 8 highlighting the undesirable manner in which Covid-19 patients and dead bodies of Covid victims were being handled in various parts of the country.Kumar pointed out a news report of a Covid-19 patient being chained to a bed in a hospital in Madhya Pradesh. He also drew the attention of the CJI to an incident from Puducherry where a dead body was thrown into a pit for burial.Right to die with dignity is a fundamental right and it includes the right to a decent burial/ cremation, Kumar had said in his letter.This would be the third case which the top court would be hearing suo motu in relation to issues stemming out of Covid-19 and the lockdown.The same three-judge bench, headed by justice Ashok Bhushan, is hearing the case regarding the plight of migrant workers due to the Covid-19 lockdown and had passed orders to facilitate their return to their home states after thousands of them went out of work due to the lockdown imposed by the central and state governments.The bench on June 9 ordered that the central and state governments should ensure the return of all migrant workers to their home states within 15 days and also asked the governments to come up with welfare schemes and job opportunities to alleviate their sufferings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-patients-treated-worse-than-animals-bodies-found-in-garbage-supreme-court/story-hQFignge7R9PKvpoRjW3kM.html

12-06-2020||India||From Moderna to Regeneron: Where do Covid-19 vaccine trials stand||Researchers and scientists are racing to develop treatment and vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has affected more than 7 million people and killed over 420,000 across the world.More than 150 groups all over the world are developing various vaccines for Covid-19 and at least 10 of them have entered the clinical trial phase. Here’s the latest on how the companies have fared:ModernaModerna Inc on Thursday confirmed it plans to start a trial of 30,000 volunteers of its much-anticipated coronavirus vaccine in July as the company enters the final stage of testing.The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech said the primary goal of the study would be to prevent symptomatic Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.The key secondary goal would be the prevention of severe disease, as defined by keeping people out of the hospital.China National Biotec Group CoChina is offering employees of some large state-run companies the option of being inoculated with two coronavirus vaccines currently in development, showing how quickly the country is moving to test the viability of its homegrown shots.Employees intending to travel overseas for work can volunteer to be administered vaccinations developed by China National Biotec Group Co or CNBG, a subsidiary of Beijing-based Sinopharm Group Co, Bloomberg has reported.Bloomberg said the proposal was relayed to state-owned companies by the government body that oversees them.CNBG is among the Chinese companies bidding to create a successful vaccine against the new coronavirus. There are currently five Chinese vaccine candidates in the human trial stage, competing with products being developed by global pharmaceutical companies such as AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna that can bring an end to the pandemic.Emergent BioSolutionsEmergent BioSolutions has said it has signed an $87 million deal to make AstraZeneca Plc’s experimental Covid-19 vaccine in the United States, boosting the British drugmaker’s efforts to bring a vaccine to the market.Emergent said, under the agreement, large-scale manufacturing of the vaccine will be done at its Baltimore Bayview facility, which has the capacity to produce up to hundreds of millions of doses annually.AstraZeneca has said that the first indication of the effectiveness of its vaccine would likely be available in June or July. However, experts have cautioned that a safe and effective vaccine could take at least 12 to 18 months from the start of development.Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson said it had fast-tracked the start of human clinical trials for its recombinant Ad26.COV2-S vaccine by two months to the second half of July, which was initially planned for September. The decision may allow the American firm to take part in the massive clinical trials program or Operation Warp Speed planned by the US government.The vaccine candidate developed by J&J is based on adenovirus, a virus which causes the common cold, and it plans to test its efficacy and safety against a placebo by giving the doses to both younger and older volunteers. The company is also in talks with the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to start larger, late-stage trials ahead of schedule, depending on results of the early studies and regulatory approval. Eli LillyThe drug giant has said that its antibody-drug to treat Covid-19 patients can be available as early as September. It is testing three antibodies therapies to cure Covid-19, one of which is slated to enter clinical trials in the coming weeks, while human trials have already been conducted on the other two therapies.The drug company’s chief scientific officer Daniel Skovronsky said in an interview with Reuters that they could have a possible treatment for the virus available if all goes well with the two antibody therapies it is testing.Skovronsky said the company is also doing preclinical studies of third antibody treatment for the illness caused by the novel coronavirus that could enter human clinical trials in the coming weeks.It has reportedly already launched human trials with two of the experimental therapies. One of them, currently designated as LY-CoV555, is being developed in partnership with Canadian biotech AbCellera. The other, JS016, is being developed with Chinese drugmaker Shanghai Junshi Biosciences.SinovacChina’s Sinovac Biotech has turned to Brazil, the epicentre of Latin America’s outbreak, for at least part of its final testing. The government of São Paulo announced Thursday that Sinovac will ship enough of its experimental vaccine to test in 9,000 Brazilians starting next month.São Paulo’s governor Joao Doria has said if it works, “with this vaccine we will be able to immunize millions of Brazilians”.Indian companiesThe Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) has partnered with University of Oxford to ramp up trials and vaccine development. SII plans to start production of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by the Oxford University in the next two to three weeks and plans to bring the vaccination for the general public by the end of October if the vaccine candidate gets approved.It has said that it is investing $100 million on the Oxford vaccine. The company along with pharma company AstraZeneca has said that the AZD1222 vaccine would be supplied to India as well as other low-income countries. Panacea Biotec Ltd has said it would partner with US-based Refana Inc to make a potential Covid-19 vaccine. The firms aim to make more than 500 million doses of the vaccine candidate and around 40 million doses are expected to be ready by early next year, Panacea told the stock exchanges.

12-06-2020||India||Delhi’s crematoriums overwhelmed with coronavirus dead||When Raj Singh’s 70-year-old mother died from the coronavirus in India’s capital, he took comfort in the prospect of a proper cremation, the funeral rite that Hindus believe releases the soul from the cycle of rebirth.But instead of chanting sacred Vedic hymns and sprinkling holy water from the Ganges River, all Singh could do was place his mother’s wrapped corpse on a wooden pyre and along with a handful of relatives watch it burn.“I never thought I would watch my mother go like this,” he said.Like elsewhere in the world, the novel coronavirus has made honouring the dead in New Delhi a hurried affair, largely devoid of the rituals that give it meaning for mourners. Cemeteries and crematoriums are overwhelmed, so there isn’t much time for ceremony, and even if there were, the government limits the number of people allowed at funerals and those in attendance must maintain distance and wear masks.“The whole grieving process has been interrupted,” said Pappu, who goes by only one name and lights the funeral pyres at Nigambodh Ghat, New Delhi’s biggest crematorium.New Delhi has officially reported close to 1,100 deaths from the coronavirus, but cemeteries and crematoriums in the city say the actual number is several hundred higher. Hospital morgues are beyond capacity, and with summer temperatures reaching 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Farenheit) some bodies are being kept on thick ice slabs.“In the beginning, I used to carry only one body. Now, helpers at the morgue will stack as many bodies as they can fit in my van,” said Bhijendra Dhigya, who drives a hearse from one New Delhi hospital to the crematorium.The spike in deaths in New Delhi comes amid a broader virus surge throughout India, where authorities are reporting some 10,000 new infections each day and more than 300 deaths. Nevertheless, India lifted most of the remaining restrictions from its 10-week lockdown on June 8, the same day it recorded what at the time was its highest single-day death toll from the virus.On Friday, India’s nationwide caseload overtook Britain to became the fourth highest in the world with 297,535 confirmed cases and 8,498 deaths, according to the Health Ministry. But that is just the known cases. Like elsewhere in the world, the actual number of infections is thought to be far higher for a number of reasons including limited testing.New Delhi’s health centers are under immense strain and the state government’s deputy chief minister, Manish Sisodia, said this week that a state health department model has projected a worst case scenario in which the number of infections in the capital — already at nearly 35,000 — could reach 550,000 by the end of July.In the worst case scenario, Sisodia said New Delhi would need 80,000 hospital beds, far more than the roughly 9,000 hospital beds currently available for virus patients. The state government is considering taking hotels and sports stadiums to use as field hospitals.The capital’s Nigambodh Ghat crematorium has handled more than 500 coronavirus cremations since the beginning of the outbreak. When some of its gas-fueled incinerators broke down, there was no one willing to repair them, so the staff reverted to traditional wooden pyres.Even with working hours extended, there has been no time for individual cremation ceremonies and exhaustive rituals with incense, garlands of marigold and chanting.The crematorium is now largely quiet except for the distinct snap and crackle of the burning wood and the din of sirens from ambulances bringing more bodies.The virus has upended Muslim burial rituals in the city as well.Islamic burials normally involve a simple ceremony. Before the body is laid to rest, it is washed. Those attending the funeral are allowed to have a look at the face of the dead and a prayer is performed, followed by a sermon from a cleric. Then close family members help place the body in a grave.Now bodies arrive at New Delhi’s largest Muslim cemetery in hearses manned by crews in hazmat suits. Bodies aren’t washed and mourners can’t view them. There are no sermons.The cemetery has already seen more than 200 burials of Covid-19 victims and with bodies steadily arriving, the grounds are filling fast.On a recent day at the burial of a 22-year-old man who died of the virus, a backhoe dug a grave as four relatives said a speedy prayer. The body was then lowered into the grave by ropes.Mohammad Shameem, a gravedigger who now oversees the burials, shook his head in disapproval as the backhoe quickly carved out another grave.“That’s not how burials should happen,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-s-crematoriums-overwhelmed-with-coronavirus-dead/story-HG0lTe01Q9AV2gHUsVsoPP.html

Chief Minister Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray has requested and appealed to the people not to crowd anywhere and follow the instructions given by the government,” tweeted chief minister Thackeray’s office.Also Watch | Maharashtra’s covid cases go past China’s total tally, over 7 million cases worldwide In Maharashtra, which has the highest number of coronavirus cases in the country, the number of Covid-19 cases crossed 97,000, with 3,590 deaths on Friday. It has outnumbered the total number of cases in China. Thackeray had on Wednesday said that though there was no decision on a fresh lockdown, the authorities may be forced to impose one if people don’t follow Covid-19-related restrictions.He had said, “The threat of Covid-19 has not passed, it still persists. As we continue to battle the pandemic, we cannot put the brakes on the wheels of the economy.

He suggested limited resumption of suburban train services in the metropolis.The recovery rate of patients in Mumbai is now 50 per cent. The number of patients testing positive for Covid-19 in Dharavi (once a hotspot) has also come down significantly, the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-not-to-be-re-announced-in-maharashtra-tweets-cm-thackeray-s-office/story-BiC63grthO4FyTGdJbEHVJ.html

12-06-2020||India||Loan moratorium case: SC asks whether there be additional interest on EMIs||The Supreme Court on Friday asked officials of the Union finance ministry and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to convene a joint meeting within three days to decide whether interest on EMIs during the six month moratorium period till August 31 can be charged by banks.The top court was hearing public interest litigation (PIL) by an Agra resident, Gajendra Sharma, who demanded a waiver on interest charged by a private bank citing the relief earlier announced by RBI on the payment of equated monthly instalments (EMIs) between March and August 31 due to the coronavirus pandemic.The central bank had on March 27 ordered a three-month moratorium till May 31 on EMIs in order to ease the financial burden on borrowers during the lockdown. This period was further extended till August 31 by a recent RBI circular.Borrowers, who availed this facility, were told by the lending banks that the interest during the March-August period will get added to their loan amount. This would prolong the loan instalments or borrowers could get their interest component increased.“Our concern in these proceedings is only whether the interest that has been deferred for three months will be added to charges payable later and whether there will be interest on interest,” the top court said, according to news agency ANI.The three-member bench had taken exception about banks levying interests on loans when RBI had announced a moratorium on loan repayments.“On one hand you are granting moratorium (on loans) but continuing with interest. It is more detrimental,” the three-member bench, comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan, SK Kaul, and MR Shah, said on June 4.The Supreme Court has posted the matter for hearing on Wednesday now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/loan-moratorium-case-sc-asks-whether-there-be-additional-interest-on-emis/story-ZeacKfyMhbut1A9mzWB7kK.html
12-06-2020||India||China has fearful leadership, lacks openness like India or US: Nicholas Burns||Former US under secretary of state Nicholas Burns on Friday dismissed suggestions China is winning the battle against Covid-19 and said the crisis should have been jointly tackled by the leadership of the US, India and China within the G20 framework.In a video conversation with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Burns said the sort of cooperation expected from US President Donald Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi didn’t happen, largely because the American leader “doesn’t believe in international cooperation” and is “a unilateralist”, while Xi wanted to compete with Trump.Asked by Gandhi why there has been no global cooperation to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, Burns said: “It is a terrible disappointment to me. I’m sure it is to you. You know, this crisis was made for the G20. It was made for Prime Minister Modi and President Xi Jinping and Donald Trump to be working together, all of our countries for the common global good.”He added, “Even the US and China are at the heart of the problem here. I hope when the next crisis comes, they will do better to work together in a more effective way.”China, Burns added, lacks the sophistication and openness of a democratic country such as India or the US and has a “fearful leadership”.“I think a lot of people right now are saying China is going to surpass, China’s winning the battle of coronavirus, that it is gaining hearts and minds. I actually don’t see that,” he said.“China certainly has extraordinary power in the world. Probably not equal to the US militarily, economically, politically yet, but it’s gaining, no question about it. What China lacks is the sophistication and openness of a democratic country like India or the US,” Burns added.The remarks from the former diplomat who played a key role in finalising the India-US civil nuclear deal came against the backdrop of a border stand-off between India and China.India and China are currently engaged in diplomatic and military contacts for an “early resolution” of the stand-off between their border troops that emerged in public in early May. Earlier this week, the two sides began what Indian officials described as a “limited military disengagement” at three hot spots along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, which has been the focus of the tensions. Burns was extremely critical of the leadership of China, saying: “China has a fearful leadership, fearful men trying to preserve their own power, increasing the grip that they have on their own citizens. Look what’s happening in Xinxiang and the Uyghurs, and in Hong Kong, just to give those examples.”He added, “And I actually think I’m hopeful about the future of India and the US. I worry the Chinese system is not going to be flexible enough to accommodate the desires of the Chinese people for human freedom and liberty. So I am a champion of democracy, as are you. I have confidence that democracies will survive these tests.”Burns served in the US government for 27 years and as a career foreign service officer, he was under secretary of state for political affairs during 2005-08, the state department’s third-ranking official when he led negotiations on the India-US civil nuclear agreement.The dialogue was part of Gandhi’s series of video conversations with global and Indian thought leaders on the Covid-19 crisis and its consequences on the Indian and global economy.In the past, the Congress leader has interacted with former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan, Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee, Harvard professor Ashish Jha, Swedish epidemiologist Johan Giesecke and Bajaj Auto managing director Rajiv Bajaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-has-fearful-leadership-lacks-openness-like-india-or-us-nicholas-burns/story-Nd0E31usEsgEIh0ukNNUaO.html

Force majeure refers to unexpected circumstances that prevent someone from fulfilling a contract.The duration of the force majeure will be excluded while calculating the delay in delivery of the contracted equipment or service and imposition of liquidated damages charges, the statement said.“This measure would bring a big relief to the domestic defence industry whose production schedules have been adversely affected by the Covid-19 situation,” a spokesperson said.Foreign vendors can approach the defence ministry directly, which may consider cases on the basis of the situation prevailing in their respective countries, he added.It couldn’t immediately be ascertained how many capital acquisition contracts would benefit from the order or the total quantum of equipment involved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-crisis-defence-ministry-gives-more-time-to-vendors-to-fulfil-contracts/story-xZLZBvx2Jq4y7MBpqud6ZN.html

12-06-2020||India||Without tiger population control, more captures expected: Top official||Authorities in Maharashtra fear there could be a sharp increase in instances of man-animal conflicts or wildlife officials being called in to capture tigers responsible for killing humans if steps aren’t taken to control the tiger population across central India.On Wednesday evening, a male tiger responsible for killing five people between February and June was captured by Maharashtra’s forest department from the buffer area of Tadoba-Andhari tiger reserve.Last month, another tiger from Brahmapuri was captured in Gondia, and the animal was said to have killed four people across the two forest divisions. An order has also been issued to capture another tiger in Rajura forest division that was allegedly responsible for four deaths.This year, 22 people have died in tiger attacks between January and June, higher than the figures for the same period of previous years, the forest department said. There were 26 deaths in 2019 and 25 in 2018.During 2015-19, Maharashtra topped the tally of human deaths in tiger attacks in India, with the most cases reported last year. The latest developments come against the backdrop of tigress Avni being shot dead in November 2018 in controversial circumstances.Nitin Kakodkar, the principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) of the state, said more incidents of tigers being captured or man-animal conflicts should be expected without population control measures in place across central Indian, especially Chandrapur district, home to more than 170 of Maharashtra’s 312 tigers.“With almost 54% of all tigers in Maharashtra located within one district, we are expecting an exponential increase in human-tiger conflict in the near future, forcing increased cases of tiger captures to avoid human deaths,” Kakodkar said.There are more than 200 tigers inside and outside protected areas in eastern Vidarbha, which has a forest cover of 22,508 sq km, or 37% of the total geographical area. The human population in this region is 14.5 million.The forest department has proposed the Maharashtra government should consider measures such as translocation of 50 tigers from the region to areas with fewer numbers, or to zoological parks or even states with low tiger populations, and sterilisation of male tigers to curb the population.“While these are suggestions at the moment, and yet to be sanctioned, there is a need for immediate solutions or at least discussions to review the expected surge in conflict. Our intent is to ensure tigers as a species are protected in this region, residents are not harmed, and our forest staff are safeguarded from any backlash from locals following conflict cases,” said Kakodkar. Forest minister Sanjay Rathod said the department was looking at habitat development in and around national parks, sanctuaries and protected areas in Maharashtra where tiger numbers are low.“We are facing an acute crisis in Chandrapur, where estimated numbers show that there could be over 500 tigers in the district within two years. Currently, there are about 15 tigers surrounding main Chandrapur city. We are anticipating an increase in conflict, and for this we have already begun reaching out to tiger scientists and independent experts for suggestions,” said Rathod.“My intent is to have more green spaces near existing sanctuaries or corridors, away from human settlements, where we increase prey base and natural resources for tigers to ensure they can safely disperse in such areas.”Rathod said a final list of suggestions will be collated in the form of a proposal to address the tiger conflict in Chandrapur. “This will be submitted to the chief minister, and with his approval sent to the Union environment ministry. The entire process is being expedited as cases are rising,” he said. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) said Chandrapur is emerging as a primary hotbed for man-animal conflicts.NTCA member secretary Anup Nayak said: “Translocation of a few tigers will be a temporary solution as other dominant ones will take over such areas very soon. As far as sterilisation is concerned, that is a major step and can have several adverse impacts. There is a serious problem in Chandrapur, but we need to have more deliberations before coming up with overall solutions.“For the time being, we need to be more assertive and ensure all our resources, including increased special tiger protection forces (STPF), are deployed for focused monitoring along with the forest department.”Experts said each case of conflict needs to be assessed in isolation, unless it has been proven the same tiger was involved in several attacks.Wildlife Conservation Trust president Anish Andheria said, “The mistake we make is to compile human-wildlife interaction cases, which are wrongly termed as conflict cases, over a 10-year period, which creates a false impression that large carnivores are bloodthirsty beasts.“By leaving out important information regarding man-made factors, such as forest degradation, fragmentation, forest fires and prey poaching, from the narrative, people get misled into believing tigers have become increasingly aggressive. In fact, the reasons for increased interactions are all man-made.“Owing to this incomplete information, wrong solutions are suggested and implemented. Instead of improving the quality of habitat, strengthening corridors, reducing livestock densities and suggesting behaviour changes in people, what is done on ground is removal of tigers.”Kishore Rithe, a former member of the state wildlife board, said while he opposed the move of capturing 50-odd tigers and sending them to zoos or sterilising males, he supported capturing problem tigers and sending them to enclosures.“I would go one step ahead – I feel that we should capture such tigers who show signs of becoming ‘problem animals’, and release them in nearby suitable habitats. That would save the lives of people and tigers both,” he said.According to the forest department, the male tiger (KT1) captured on Wednesday evening was responsible for kills on February 15, May 19, April 8, June 4 and June 6.“The first two kills were closer to the fringes of the core area of Tadoba-Andhari tiger reserve, while the remaining were in the buffer near Kolara and Bamangaon. However, all kills were made when local residents had entered forest to gather wood, mahua or tendu leaves,” said Kakodkar.“Thus, I issued orders for the tiger’s capture on Monday.”On Wednesday, a team of forest officers including a wildlife veterinary officer set up three live baits using cattle near a lake, Chaiti talao, near Kolara, located in the buffer of the tiger reserve, and waited atop machans for the tiger.The tiger killed one of the baits in the day and returned in the evening to eat it. “With all precautions in place, the wildlife veterinary officer shot the dart around 5 pm, tranquilising the animal before sunset,” said Kakodkar. “The animal was shifted to Gorewada zoo and wildlife rescue centre in Nagpur to be kept in captivity.”On May 7, a two-year-old tigress (N1), allegedly responsible for the death of two people in Gondia was tranquillised and captured by the forest department and sent to Gorewada zoo. After two reported kills by the animal in November and December last year, the tiger reportedly killed two people collecting forest produce in the last week of April and another on May 2.Andheria said research has shown that tigers generally do not get into conflict in the areas they live in. “Dispersed young animals, if at all, are relatively more prone to get involved in skirmishes with people. If a number of tigers have reached the ecological capacity of the habitat, young tigers will be moved out of that area. Conflict cannot increase exponentially in open habitats,” he said.“However, whenever a tiger is found to engage in repeated attacks, it needs to be moved into captivity…Problems being witnessed currently are a symptom of human-induced pressures. At the same time, management practices within core forest areas should not be replicated outside.”As the department searches for the tiger in Rajura, another order issued in January to capture another male tiger in Chandrapur division lapsed in April. The chief wildlife warden’s orders lapse after two months of being issued if they are not renewed.“While the order for trapping the Rajura tiger is in place, and the department is making progress, the Chandrapur tiger has not made any human kills or attacks in sometime, leading to a lapse in the trapping order. We are yet to take a final call in that regard,” said Kakodkar. Tiger scientist Bilal Habib from the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, said, “Conflict and tiger numbers are increasing, and we need all stakeholders to come together urgently, make wise decisions, and put forth solutions before things go out of hand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/without-tiger-population-control-more-captures-expected-top-official/story-zWJZBrcTJrVeG27GWii2IO.html

Burns was speaking to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi via video-conferencing.“Our greatest American in the last 100 years is Martin Luther King Junior. He fought peaceful and non-violent battles. His spiritual idol was Mahatma Gandhi. King led us to become a better country. We elected an African-American President Barack Obama. And yet, you see race come back now. You see African-American mistreated,” said Burns.“It was horrible, horrible murder of George Floyd, a young African-American man by the police in Minneapolis. There are millions of Americans protesting peacefully as is our right. And yet, the President treats them like terrorists,” he added.“Countries sometimes have to go through a discussion, a political debate about who are we? At the core, what kind of nation are we? We are an immigrant nation, a tolerant nation,” said Burns.Floyd died after a police officer pressed his knee against his neck in Minneapolis on May 25. His last words “I can’t breathe” have been a rallying cry for the protesters who have launched demonstrations in various parts of the Unites States.The issue has also led to serious debate in the American society about race.Gandhi held a conversation with Burns on how coronavirus crisis was reshaping the world order. The interaction between also covered a wide range of issues, including racism in the United States.Burns is currently the Professor of Practice of Diplomacy and International Politics at Harvard’s John F Kennedy School of Government. At the Harvard Kennedy School, Burns is the Director of The Future of Diplomacy Project and Faculty Chair for the programs on the Middle East, India and South Asia.During his career in the State Department, he was United States Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs within the United States Department of State.

But now you yourself have made women to sit at liquor shops. What can be more shameful and double standard than this?” Kamal Nath said in his tweet posted in Hindi on Thursday. शिवराज जी आप जब विपक्ष में थे तो प्रदेश में शराब को लेकर खूब विरोध करते थे,खूब भाषण देते थे,शराब को बहन - बेटियों के लिये ख़तरा बताते हुए उनको साथ लेकर धरने पर बैठते थे।अब तो आपने बहन- बेटियों को ही शराब की दुकानो पर बैठा दिया?इससे शर्मनाक व दोहरा चरित्र कुछ नहीं हो सकता है ? pic.twitter.com/TXh41mVd7bState BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai said, “The Congress leaders are not able to understand that there is a difference between a woman employee selling liquor and a woman employee supervising the sale as per her duty in the department. Did Congress leaders try to know who of the women employees are discharging what duties?”Excise commissioner Rajiv Chandra Dubey said, “Largely women employees of the department have been kept away from sale of liquor. They are mainly engaged in the role of supervision.

The highest number of districts were in Madhya Pradesh (21), followed by Uttar Pradesh (11), Gujarat (9), Rajasthan (5) and Telangana (3).Here’s a list of the districts with high Covid-19 fatality rate:Madhya Pradesh: Mandi, Sehore, Umaria, Mandsaur, Rajgarh, Satna, Ujjain, Hoshangabad, Burhan, Khargone, Sagar, Dewas, East Nimar (Khandwa), Shajapur, Ratlam Chhindwara, Datia, Rajgarh, Tikamgarh, Agar Malwa, JhabuaUttar Pradesh: Lalitpur, Jhansi, Meerut, Agra, Aligarh, Gorakhpur, Firozabad, Mathura, Etah, Jalaun, MahobaMaharashtra: Washim, Nandurbar, Jalgaon, Dhule, Solapur, Aurangabad, Nashik, Satara, Amravati, WardhaGujarat: Porbandar, Panch Mahal, Anand, Ahmedabad, Bhavnagar, Patna, Rajendra Nagar, Kutch, BharuchRajasthan: Karauli, Sawai Madhopur, Pratapgarh, Jaipur, BaranTelangana: Narayanpur, Mancherial, NirmalHimachal Pradesh: Mandi, ShimlaWest Bengal: Kolkata, 24 Parganas NorthDelhi: Shahdara, North-East DelhiHaryana: JindKarnataka: TumkuruPunjab: KapurthalaChhattisgarh: Bastar||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/these-69-districts-have-fatality-rate-much-higher-than-national-average/story-5LgQthgLCGHrsiTTtvBAuI.html
12-06-2020||India||Covid-19: 46 districts in 13 states have higher confirmation rate than national average||India has seen improvements in the coronavirus disease scenario in the months since the outbreak was reported. But there are some districts which are areas of concern, the Centre has said.These 46 districts have a Covid-19 confirmation rate (positives for total Covid-19 tests done) of more than 10% as compared to 5.70% national rate. They were identified in a meeting held by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba with states on Wednesday.Gauba also gave a detailed presentation in the meeting on the overall Covid-19 status in India as on June 9 and the challenges that have emerged since the government eased lockdown restrictions.He said that the highest number of these districts (12) are in Maharashtra, which is the worst-affected state due to the Covid-19 pandemic. These districts are: Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Aurangabad, Raigad, Pune, Solapur, Nashik, Akola, Osmanabad, Gondia and Jalgaon.In Delhi, nine out of 11 districts have a higher confirmation rate, the presentation said. These are North-West, Central, South-East, East, West, North, Shahdara, South-West and North-East.Telangana has four districts namely Medchal Malkajgiri, Hyderabad, Rangareddy, and Suryapet. In Tamil Nadu, Chennai, Chengalpattu, Thiruvallur, Ariyalur have a higher confirmation rate.Similarly, Khgaria, Purbi Champran, Sitamarhi, Muzaffarpur in Bihar; Khargone, Burhanpur, Neemuch in Madhya Pradesh; Firozabad, Chitrakoot in UP; Hojai and Dima Hasao in Assam; Ahmedabad and Vadodara in Gujarat; Sepahijala in Tripura; Tehri Garhwal in Uttarakhand; Howrad and West Bengal and Pali in Rajasthan are the other districts where the Covid-19 confirmation rate is higher than the national average.“The increase in confirmation rate (between May 18 and June 9) indicates at either increase in spread of coronavirus or lower testing during this period,” the presentation said.The presentation also pointed out that there was a huge turnaround time for getting test results in several districts, especially in the rural areas. HT had reported that Jharkhand and Bihar were taking up to 14 days to provide results of the tests taken at the quarantine centers. “The delay is because of the sudden increase in the swabs being taken,” said Jharkhand health secretary Nitin Kulkarni. Bihar health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh said the pendency of the tests results is reducing as swabs of most of the symptomatic persons in quarantine centers have been taken.On the positive side, the Cabinet Secretary said that the doubling rate has increased to 16.9 days from earlier 14.1 days and the national fatality rate was still below 3%. He also said that the spread of Covid-19 cases to newer districts was not very high and the situation there was under control. Gauba said that several districts have reported slowing down of Covid-19 cases, which indicated that the lockdown had a positive impact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-46-districts-in-13-states-have-higher-confirmation-rate-than-national-average/story-lAYgcXRdbwGYFTR3LjQ2VM.html

We kept searching all over the hospital with the help of police and today, we came to know that the body was handed over to another family and they performed the last rites,” a relative of the deceased told IANS.The family of the other deceased was called back to the hospital on Thursday and it was found that the body of their relative was still lying in the mortuary. After taking the consent of the relatives of the 37-year-old man, the body was handed over to them.“The entire incident is very shocking for us. We are planning to lodge a complaint against the hospital administration,” the relative said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-hospital-mixes-up-covid-19-victim-s-body-with-another/story-JhjStaKQF272xL5X8504tK.html
12-06-2020||India||‘Aggressively carry out core health measures’, says WHO South-East Asia director||World Health Organisation (WHO)’s regional director (South-East Asia) Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh says there is no difference in the protection medical masks and N95 respirators offer. She says scientific evidence shows both result in large reduction in the spread of Covid-19. In an interview to Sanchita Sharma, Singh also spoke about the need for the general population to wear fabric or medical masks in public places. Edited excerpts:What is better? N95 respirator or surgical mask?Randomised controlled trials do not show any difference between medical/surgical masks and N95 respirators in reducing the transmission of airborne infections. Some observational studies also show both medical masks and N95 result in large reductions in the transmission of coronavirus.WHO recommends health care workers use N95 masks and other protection when conducting aerosol-generating procedures or in settings where these procedures are occurring. It is usually in health care settings, for example, when a health worker is intubating a patient.What is the evidence regarding the protection provided by masks?Masks are a part of a comprehensive package of measures to suppress transmission and save lives. The use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection.What kind of mask should the general public wear?The general public is advised to wear non-medical, fabric masks where there is a widespread transmission and limited capacity to implement control measures, such as case-finding and contact tracing. Wearing masks is important where physical distancing is not possible, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments.Following WHO research and development meeting in February, a research group was requested to conduct a study on masks. The study identified preferable types of fabrics, the number of layers, and the composition of a non-medical mask. It should include an inner layer of absorbent material such as cotton, a middle layer of non-woven material such as polypropylene, and an outer layer of a non-absorbent material such as polyester or polyester blend. The mask should allow you to breathe while talking and walking briskly.With cases rising, what actions are needed to prevent a surge?The transmissibility and severity of Covid-19 have not changed. ...Severity also remains consistent. We know that the virus causes a range of illnesses, with a majority of people having experienced mild symptoms and 20% a more severe disease. As the transmission of Covid-19 is not typically homogenous within the country, a national risk assessment should be supported and implemented through sub-national or even community-level risk assessment. We need to aggressively implement core public health measures - detect and test, isolate and treat, and trace contacts, promote safe hygiene practices and respiratory etiquette, protect health workers, and increase health system capacity. This is a pandemic. It needs a whole-of-society approach. Our fight against Covid-19 is far from over. The world is still facing a big wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.Do lockdowns work if infection rates are high?Lockdowns have multiple objectives as public health measures for social distancing, to slow down the virus transmission, and to allow the healthcare systems enough time to strengthen infrastructure and capacities. The cornerstone of the response in any transmission scenario continues to be to find, isolate, test and care, and to trace and quarantine contacts.Is more testing needed to diagnose and isolate?Testing is an important component of surveillance and guides contract tracing, isolation, and treatment. It also shows where response efforts need to be directed to combat the disease. India has been calibrating its testing strategy as per the changing situation, taking into account scope, need, and capacity. With increased testing, the trajectory of positive cases will go up. But it will also help in better preparedness and response.What is the role of antibody tests?The PCR-based tests are better for telling whether you are infected or not and the serology, or the blood test, is better to detect whether you have been infected recently or in the past.Tests to detect antibody responses to Covid-19 in the population will be critical to support the development of vaccines. Based on current data, WHO does not recommend the use of antibody-detecting rapid diagnostic tests for patient care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aggressively-carry-out-core-health-measures-says-who-south-east-asia-director/story-7UGHUTdKLpS5Bzx7nPfIyI.html
12-06-2020||India||Assam gas well blaze endangered wetlands, several species: Survey||The gas well blowout in Assam’s Tinsukia district has polluted the Lohit river and adjoining eco-sensitive Maguri-Motapung wetland and toxic pollutants may have killed fish, insects as well as pose risk to endangered Gangetic dolphins in the region, a preliminary Wildlife Institute of India (WII) survey report has said. It has cited interviews with locals and said the Oil India Limited (OIL) did not have a mitigation plan for such accidents. WII has hence suggested a comprehensive impact assessment of entire OIL field operations in the biodiversity-rich area. The well caught fire on Tuesday days after the blowout, or leakage of gas and condensate, began on May 27. Dibru-Saikhowa Biosphere Reserve (DSBR) located nearby is home to endangered hoolock gibbons.The Union environment ministry gave the environmental clearance to OIL on May 11 for extension drilling and testing of hydrocarbons at seven locations under Dibru Saikhowa National Park. The report said the fumes and oil coating has affected flora and fauna.“The contaminants and oil are continuing to be released in surrounding areas and immediate steps are needed to contain this spillover. The toxins released are known to have long-term persistence in soils and sediments, which will not only affect current life conditions but due to sustained release over a long period, pose a serious health risk for a longer-term,” said the report, a copy of which HT has seen, submitted to the ministry.WII scientist Qamar Qureshi said the region’s lowland forests are unique and they have found other wells are also leaking which can have long term impacts. “We have recommended a thorough assessment of disaster mitigation possibilities before implementing any more exploration projects,” he said.Soumitra Dasgupta, additional director-general (wildlife), environment ministry, said the wetland is affected and so are the aquatic species.“The national park is slightly away from the accident site. We will wait for the detailed WII study and response from the Assam forest department. We have written to them.”An OIL spokesperson did not comment on the report saying they are unaware of it. “Whatever condensed oil had been released earlier has been burnt off. There is no contamination from it anymore. We are trying to contain the gas which is releasing within four weeks.”WII, which carried the survey from May 29 to June 4, has recommended that the approved new wells and further exploration in the area be put on hold until OIL has disaster handling capabilities. It found the presence of at least five Gangetic dolphins in the 20 km stretch of the Lohit river it surveyed and indicated that they will be at grave risk from the ongoing spill.The team has collected samples of tissue and blubber from a dolphin carcass, which is being analysed for the presence of various contaminants. WII said new wells and explorations in this area should be initiated only after a thorough evaluation.It will come out with a detailed report on the impact on the region’s biodiversity by the month-end. WII has also flagged the long term environmental impacts of the spill as a blowout spews hundreds of chemicals in the air, water, and soil.Residents of the area reported severe breathing difficulty, headaches, and nausea to WII. Even the WII survey team experienced similar symptoms due to the heavy presence of oil. The entire landscape, including the wetland, is coated in layers of oil, WII said.The biodiversity-rich area is one of the important remaining habitats of several endangered and range-restricted species, according to WII. DSBR is also home to tigers, elephants, wild buffalos, leopards, capped langurs, slow loris, as well as critically endangered bird species such as the Bengal florican, white-winged wood duck, greater adjutant stork, white-rumped vulture, slender-billed vulture. The rare and endemic black-breasted parrotbill is found there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-gas-well-blaze-endangered-wetlands-several-species-survey/story-FdodXVaGmoMKD7swakjOvL.html

It may “compound the situation of unrest and instigate festering emotions in the erstwhile Jammu & Kashmir state, in addition to having international ramifications”, it said while rejecting the plea.CIC said “disclosure of the operational details will adversely impact security and strategic preparedness of the armed forces”. HT has seen a copy of the order.Of the 50 requests from the then state government for prosecuting the personnel, 47 were denied, according to the Centre’s response to a question tabled in Rajya Sabha in 2018.Venkatesh Nayak, programme head at the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (an NGO) and a RTI activist, who sought the info in February 2018, said he took the matter to CIC after defence ministry and army refused details.CIC has directed the ministry to provide an affidavit to Nayak saying there are “no official records containing details of procedure or norms, criteria and standard that is to be followed by the Ministry while deciding the evidence submitted by the government of J&K government in prosecution sanction cases”.It asked the ministry to submit in writing it is the competent authority to sanction or deny permission to prosecute accused army personnel.CIC said the request for details have to be weighed on the scale of relativity of larger good between alleged victims and that of the state. Lawyer Navdeep Singh, a former reservist, said the decision on whether to prosecute or not will vary. “So, it is not surprising that there is no singular procedure,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/info-on-casualties-involving-army-in-j-k-adverse-for-ops-says-cic/story-jylG5vZ9h5wtHAas6ZtisL.html
12-06-2020||India||India side-steps issues in Nepal border row||The external affairs ministry on Thursday side-stepped issues that have complicated a border row with Nepal, holding up the importance of long-standing bilateral relations and ongoing cooperation amid the Covid-19 crisis.The move was perceived in diplomatic circles as an effort to dial down tensions that have spiralled in recent days, after the KP Sharma Oli government in Kathmandu tabled a constitutional amendment in Parliament to give legal backing to a political map that depicts the regions of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as Nepalese territory.Asked at a weekly news briefing why India hadn’t responded to Nepal’s overtures for talks on the border dispute and Oli’s criticism of “threatening” remarks by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “We have already made our position clear on these issues.”India, Srivastava added, deeply values its ties with Nepal. “India has been reaching out to friendly neighbouring countries, including Nepal, in line with the prime minister’s initiative to chart out a common strategy to combat Covid in the region.”Srivastava said India had supplied 25 tonnes of medical aid to Nepal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-side-steps-issues-in-nepal-border-row/story-VTzleZuLH7i15GD6Lspu7L.html
12-06-2020||India||Palghar lynching: Supreme Court seeks response from Maharashtra, Centre||The Supreme Court on Thursday sought responses of the Centre and Maharashtra government to separate petitions seeking a probe by central agencies into the April 16 lynching of three people, including two Sadhus, in Palghar while questioning the state police’s conduct and alleging bias in their investigations.The kin of the two and six members of Panch Dashnam Juna Akhara, whom the sadhus were affiliated to, have sought a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the killings. One Ghanshyam Upadhyay has filed a separate plea seeing a National Investigation Agency (NIA) investigation. The petitions were tagged with that of lawyer Shashak Shekhar Jha, who moved the court in April seeking a CBI or judicial probe into the incident. “Issue notice returnable in the second week of July 2020,” a justice Ashok Bhushan-led bench said. The bench, also comprising justices M R Shah and V Ramasubramanian, posted these matters for further hearing in the second week of July.A mob of villagers lynched Kalpavruksha Giri, Sushil Giri, and their driver, Neelesh Telgade. The crowd suspected them of being child-lifters, dragged them out, and beat them with sticks. The three from Kandivali in Mumbai were on their way to a funeral at Surat in Gujarat amid the Covid-19 lockdown when their car was stopped and they were attacked in the presence of police, who have maintained they were outnumbered. A video of the incident triggered outrage and a war of words between the ruling Shiv Sena-led alliance and the opposition BJP.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on April 20 set up a high-level police probe, suspension of police personnel for dereliction of duty and the arrest of over 100 accused. He warned against giving the incident a communal colour.The petition that has sought the CBI probe accused police of inaction. “The entire incident and its handling raise several questions which remain unanswered till date and as the petitioners apprehend shall never be answered unless they are investigated by an independent, unsullen and reputed arm of the central agencies,” it said.“Several video clippings have emerged on social media and news reports which very clearly demonstrate the active involvement of the police present, who can be seen handing over the three persons to the unlawful assembly of persons gathered.”It said the totality of the circumstances raises serious and unanswered questions about the state police’s ability to independently investigate into the incident “considering the potential involvement of the police in the gruesome lynching”. Maharashtra government’s lawyers opposed the petitions and said similar pleas are pending before the Bombay high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/palghar-lynching-supreme-court-seeks-response-from-maharashtra-centre/story-NLbkhcgLO2nuSxbhJREHpL.html
12-06-2020||India||‘Govt’s focus is on giving services to those in need’, says BJP’s Bhupender Yadav||Assembly elections in Bihar are due later this year.Bhupender Yadav, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in-charge for the state Bihar, spoke to Smriti Kak Ramachandran about the polls, anti-incumbency, migrant workers, etc. Edited excerpts:What are the challenges the party is facing apart from its inability to hold rallies amid the pandemic?After five years, every party has to be ready to face elections. The situation we are facing is a challenge not just for the country but for the entire humankind. The government has dealt with the situation effectively and systematically. There was an implementation of four successful lockdowns and a gradual unlocking.If unlocking proceeds smoothly, then elections in Bihar will also be conducted. ...digital [technologies]... and social media play a crucial role, but at the same time, personal contact, humanitarian approach, ground-level work, and booth level activity cannot be ignored. All these factors will continue to be important during electioneering.There is a perception that Bihar’s delayed response to bringing migrant workers home will impact the elections. This will be a challenge in addition to factors such as anti-incumbency...It is an incorrect perception. During the first three phases of the lockdown, no movement was allowed because preparedness was necessary to fight the pandemic. The government worked with awareness and preparedness. We cannot say there was a delay. Till today, 1,058 trains have carried 2.1 million passengers home. In addition to this, the Bihar government pressed 4,500 buses into service and ran 26 trains for the workers. The response of the railway ministry and the Bihar government has been one of synergy.Whether it was setting up quarantine centres, providing ration, offering social security through schemes, the government has taken care of the needy. The marginalised sections have seen the impact on the ground of the services provided. And in Bihar, there is proof of development.The state government is carrying out a skill mapping exercise, which has shown a bulk of returnees are construction workers. How will the government offer jobs to workers will limited skill sets?The government has doubled the allocation for MNREGS [Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme] and also increased the workdays. There are many challenges. Yet there are roads and power everywhere. Employment avenues will be created in the agricultural sector even though Bihar is already quite ahead in agricultural production. There are state-specific provisions in the Atmanirbhar Bharat package [to deal with the pandemic]...The opposition feels the government is more focused on holding elections rather than on fighting the pandemic...It is incorrect to say the government is focusing only on the election. It has focused on offering services to those in need. The demand and supply of ration, for instance, have been met everywhere. Some people think only tweeting is politics. We don’t think so. Those opposing and criticising us were not even present in Bihar during the pandemic. Their criticism does not cut ice with people because they were absent.Covid-19 has exposed shortcomings in the health infrastructure. Do you think this will become a poll issue in a state?The government has done a lot of work to ramp up the health infrastructure and even during the lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus, a fund was created. Just as for polio eradication, a door-to-door campaign was conducted, a similar exercise will be carried out for mapping corona cases.Health workers are also being empowered and offered protection. And all this is being done for everyone and it is not caste-specific. Our party does not subscribe to the politics of caste conflict. We believe in the politics of coordination and cooperation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-s-focus-is-on-giving-services-to-those-in-need-says-bihar-bjp-s-bhupender-yadav/story-l7pcsXQYjdhA9tKYKZix0N.html
12-06-2020||India||Covid-19 pandemic forces hospitals to scale up||“Somebody help me. I need a corona bed for my father,” said Ajai Kumar, carrying his sick father who was gasping for breath into the emergency ward of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital in the Walled City of Delhi after being turned away by two private hospitals.That was last Friday (June 5).Sudama Kumar, a 63-year-old retired official of the Central Public Works Department had developed fever the week before, but when it progressed to breathlessness, his son took him to Max hospital, Patparganj on June 3, fearing it might be the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).“He was so sick that he fell off the chair and collapsed in a heap on the floor [but] the hospital turned us away without testing him because they had no free beds for Covid or suspected Covid patients,” said Kumar, whose father is a beneficiary of the Central Government Health Scheme, a health care facility scheme for current and former employees of the central government.When asked to verify Kumar’s account, Max Hospitals declined to comment.“I next took him to a small nursing home, which got the test done but asked us to leave after he tested positive because the clinic did not treat Covid patients,” said Kumar. Finally, Sudama Kumar received a bed in the Delhi government-run LNJP.With the number of cases rising every day, the strain on the health care infrastructure of metropolises like Delhi and Mumbai has begun to show. In the past two months, several people took to social media to express their dismay at being unable to find hospital beds or proper treatment for their family members and friends.During a recent press conference, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that Delhi will require 80,000 hospital beds by the end of July; based on the infection’s current doubling rate of 12.6 days, by July 31, the number of cases in Delhi will reach 550,000.Mumbai was only testing 4000 samples daily at the beginning of this month; its testing capacity is 7000 tests a day.Hospitals, particularly those designated in various states as Covid-19 treatment hospitals, have been forced to adapt using limited infrastructure, space and human resources. Early in the pandemic itself, healthy patients were segregated from suspected and Covid-positive patients; the focus shifted to critical care treatment; hospitals staggered timings of staff to decongest the wards, and scaled up e-consultations and remote management of chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease. As early as March, hospitals like the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi began to postpone elective surgeries to free up hospital staff for Covid care.Experts said that managing a pandemic will leave hospitals with some important lessons.“Measures taken now will help reduce the overload on the tertiary and secondary hospitals and improve documentation, data-collection, diagnosis and care without risking the safety of the patients or the health workers. For patients already under treatment, reports can be viewed online and prescriptions made accordingly. Patients will need to come to tertiary care hospitals outpatient clinics only if the treatment needs an overhaul or if they need surgery or invasive treatments, like radiation,” said Dr Nikhil Tandon, professor and head of the department of endocrinology and metabolism, AIIMS, Delhi. He is a member of the board of governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India that drafted the brand new Telemedicine Practice Guidelines notified in May.Telemedicine has already helped decongest AIIMS Delhi, which moved its out-patient department services online from April 8 to follow up with the around 60,000 patients registered for treatment during the lockdown.This is continuing post the lockdown at AIIMS, which is arguably one of the world’s busiest hospitals with a daily footfall of 15,000 (3.5 million patients in the outpatient clinics, 200,000 in the in-patient department) and 170,000 surgeries in pre-pandemic times. Around half of these patients are from other states. Telemedicine may well emerge as the most transformative change to provide health care.“Leveraging India’s IT strength and increasing investment in telemedicine to shift from human resource-intensive care to meet shortfall to a great extent, especially of super-specialists. Start-ups are doing it already, we have e-ICUs and home-isolation support remote-managed from hundreds of kilometres away,” said C K Mishra, former health secretary and mission director of National Health Mission.Do more with lessWith Covid-19 spreading , India was forced to rapidly scale up its critical care infrastructure after seven decades during which much of public health budgets went to programmes on maternal and child health. It did that, and with some measure of success.Several thousands with severe disease were treated, which would not have been possible a couple of months ago. As of June 11, 141,028 people are reportedly cured of Covid-19 in India, which translates into a recovery rate of 49.21%. For the first time since the pandemic began, the number of those recovered has overtaken the number of those who are currently infected.On March 30, four weeks after the first two Covid-19 cases in Delhi and Hyderabad (on March 2), there were just 32,000 ventilators for all diseases across all states in public and private hospitals, according to an internal assessment report of the ministry of health.According to the Association of Indian Medical Device Industry, a private industry body, the manufacturing capacity for ventilators alone has increased from 3,000 a month in February to 33,000 a month in May.By June 9, centre and states have designated 958 Covid hospitals across the country, as well as 2,313 Covid Health Centres (for those who don’t need too much medical support) and 7,525 Covid Care Centres (for those with mild infections who can’t isolate themselves at home).That’s only a start.“A few thousand ventilator beds are not enough for India’s 1.35 billion population. It’s certainly not enough for when cases peak in July and August. It’s a jump-start, but we need to sustain it and [have] a lot more testing, a lot more beds, far more hospitals to make up for decades of neglect of public health,” said Dr Jacob John, former head of the department of virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.In two short months, India has had to upgrade its flailing infrastructure and create a contingency plan for large-scale medical emergencies. This, despite public health expenditure hovering at just around 1.28% of its Gross Domestic Product.“Many countries are learning that you cannot build health care capacity during a crisis. It takes time and investment to build a good public health system. India has failed to invest in health for decades and this must change post-Covid19. Health spend must at least increase to 2.5% of GDP, at a minimum,” said Prof Madhukar Pai, director, McGill Global Health Programs, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.As part of the stimulus package finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in May, Rs 15,000 crore has been earmarked to strengthen public health infrastructure, down to the block level. India has 7,096 of them.“Each city and district has to develop its own programme because there is a difference between metros and other cities, and between towns and rural India,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, professor and head of pulmonology and director, AIIMS Delhi.Made in IndiaWith roughly 10% of all Covid-19 infections in India found in hospital employees – in March and April, hospitals around the country became hot spots and were shut down – the focus shifted early on to procuring protective personal equipment kits (PPEs). After an early consignment of 1.7 lakh imported kits from China were found to be faulty, domestic production was ramped up. By mid-April, the Bureau of Indian Standards came up with stringent measures.Now, domestic manufacturers provide medical devices, protective gear, diagnostics, hospital equipment, and telemedicine services. As of Tuesday, the Centre had provided 12.84 million N-95 masks and 10.47 million PPE kits to states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-pandemic-forces-hospitals-to-scale-up/story-7iRDBFUC4V5Xk9SgNA6fxM.html

A similar situation also resulted in the collapse of the Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress coalition in Karnataka. The Congress has blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for these desertions and the fall of its governments.In the 200-member Rajasthan assembly, the Congress has 107 legislators and also claims to have the support of 13 independents, two legislators each from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) as also one member of the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD).The BJP has 72 legislators and is supported by the Rashtriya Loktantrk Party (RLP) that has three members in the assembly.Three Rajya Sabha seats in Rajasthan are going to polls on June 19. The Congress has fielded party general secretary in-charge of organisation KC Venugopal and state office bearer Neeraj Dangi while the BJP has named Rajendra Gehlot and Omkar Singh Lakhawat as its candidates. After three of its legislators resigned from the party and the Gujarat assembly last week, the Congress swung into action and shifted its 21 lawmakers to a resort in Abu Road, Jaipur.Rajasthan Congress leaders alleged that attempts are being made by the BJP to lure legislators with huge financial inducements, a charge vehemently denied by the BJP.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot too claimed lots of money has changed hands in Jaipur and said there were reports that the BJP was planning a Madhya Pradesh-like operation in his state.“Our legislators are intelligent, alert and united. Rajasthan is the only state in the country where 13 independents supported our government neither for any exchange of money nor any post,” he told reporters in Jaipur.In late March, five Congress legislators in Gujarat quit the party and the assembly ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections then scheduled for March 26. However, the polls were deferred due to the coronavirus-induced nationwide lockdown.Three more Congress legislators resigned last week, bringing the party’s strength down to 65 in the 182-member Gujarat assembly. The ruling BJP has 103 legislators. With 10 vacancies in all -- eight because of resignations by Congress legislators, and two due to court cases over poll-related disputes -- the effective strength of the Gujarat assembly now stands at 172. A candidate will have to get 35 votes to get elected to the Upper House of Parliament and polls will be held for four Rajya Sabha seats from the state.The BJP has fielded Abhay Bhardwaj, Ramilaben Bara and Narhari Amin while Bharatsinh Solanki and Shaktisinh Gohil are the Congress candidates.On Wednesday, Gehlot summoned his legislators for an emergency meeting at a Jaipur resort . They were asked to stay there but some left after attending the meeting; they returned on Thursday for another round of consultations.The party has given time till Friday for all its legislators to move to the resort.The Rajasthan government’s chief whip Mahesh Joshi, in a complaint to the director-general, anti-corruption bureau (ACB), alleged that there were attempts to poach Congress legislators as well as some supporting independent lawmakers.But leader of the opposition Gulab Chand Kataria dismissed allegations that the BJP was making any attempt to overthrow the Congress government in Rajasthan. He questioned why the Congress was lodging its legislators in a resort when it is running the government in the state and has support of independents.“This shows that they have differences within the party and to stop that they have been camping in a resort and blaming the BJP. Who are they complaining to? It is their government in the state. ”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wary-of-defections-congress-moves-rajasthan-mlas-to-resort-before-rajya-sabha-polls/story-Ja6f81dd0GanX8Ggt5bUpM.html
12-06-2020||India||Tamil Nadu sets up panel to probe ‘unaccounted’ Covid-19 fatalities||Tamil Nadu’s low mortality rate has come under scrutiny, with the state government setting up a committee to probe unaccounted Covid-19 deaths in Chennai. The Directorate of Public Health (DPH) and Preventive Medicine found that the death registry maintained by the Greater Chennai Corporation recorded 236 deaths that were not added to the state’s tally. DPH has now formed a nine-member committee to reconcile Covid-19 related deaths for Chennai. “We are yet to see the data from the corporation which will help us get to the bottom of the problem,” says Dr P Vadivelan who is heading the committee which will soon discuss the matter with officials of corporation, public health and Directorate of Medical Education. “We suspect that many of these deaths happened at home so they may have received tests late and reported late.” Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami told reporters on Thursday: “We don’t hide the number of deaths, we won’t gain anything if we do that.”Newspapers on Thursday reported that some Covid deaths are not reflecting in the state tally as per the daily data released by DPH and department of the health and family welfare in Tamil Nadu. As of June 8, this bulletin reported that Chennai accounted for 224 out of the 286 deaths in Tamil Nadu. When DPH officials found an additional 236 more deaths in Chennai’s city corporation, a revision exercise was ordered to reconcile the data. “We are conducting an analysis of our line list of all the positive patients in the state which should give us a clear picture,” says Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner G Prakash. Director of Public Health Dr TS Selvavinayagam has asked the civic body to share data from March and for all deaths to be reported on a daily basis. “Reconciliation is an approved administrative mechanism. The aim is to rectify the registry by understanding why, when and how the numbers are reported as two-three departments are involved,” says Selvavinayagam. A senior official of the corporation said on condition of anonymity that “ the audit can go through these cases and if it is due to Covid-19, there is no shame in adding those figures.”On the same day that the mismatch came to light, a Chennai-based anti-corruption group, Arappor Iyakkam, sent a report to health secretary Beela Rajesh challenging underreporting of Covid-19 death cases. It released two mortuary cards from the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital in Chennai that were marked ‘Covid-19 positive’ and complained the cases did not reflect in the state tally. “Whistleblowers have been sending us such cases to be exposed,” said Jayaram Venkatesan, founder, Arappor Iyakkam. “The argument that there is miscommunication falls flat because we have exposed cases in government hospitals which also needs to be investigated.” Officials say that hospitals must inform both the corporation and DPH of Covid-19 deaths but only few are reporting to the corporation (via local authorities such as sanitary inspectors and zonal officers) which, in turn, has not updated the DPH. “In other districts in Tamil Nadu, we have a deputy director of health service who coordinates at the block or municipality level and reports to the DPH. That mechanism is missing in Chennai,” said a former health official who asked not to be named. The state health department said 1,875 persons tested positive, while 22 succumbed to the virus. The capital Chennai recorded more than 1,400 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-sets-up-panel-to-probe-unaccounted-covid-19-fatalities/story-NcKLoUcf8tRULIJaKEgZMN.html
12-06-2020||India||Railways mulls generating jobs under NREGS||The ministry of railways is considering generating employment under the government’s flagship rural job guarantee scheme, a move aimed at helping migrants who have returned home in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed to slow its spread.The idea was proposed at high-level meeting held by Union railway minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday with senior ministry officials , according to officials aware of the development. The Indian Railways may generate employment for the migrants by tapping resources under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme for minor construction work. The national carrier mostly employs skilled labourers though private contractors for its construction work but the meeting discussed the use of workers under MGNREGA “instead of private labour and contractors for minor construction work usually in and around stations,” a senior railway official said, asking not to be named. The rail ministry has asked railway zones to get in touch with district collectors across states to get an estimate of the workforce and demand for work in rural areas. The ministry’s move comes even as both the Centre and the states have begun the process of undertaking a comprehensive skill mapping exercise of migrant workers as part of an attempt to find them work closer home. “ NREGA work seekers are daily wage workers. The plan is to discourage distress migration. It will be tough to bring them to urban areas where railway work is usually done... but through this scheme railways can provide employment in rural areas for minor work such as building boundary walls around stations, etc,” the railway official added.This won’t be the first time Railways is using the scheme. In 2015, it looked at potential work that could be taken up under MGNREGA. The areas identified included “construction and maintenance of approach roads for level crossings; developing and cleaning silted waterways and drains along the tracks...” a second official said.“Railways should look at employing as many labourers whenever they can...because even though they focus on skilled construction work they will have a requirement for manual work as well where these labourers can be used,” said Jawaharlal Nehru University associate professor Himanshu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-mulls-generating-jobs-under-nregs/story-JSit4XYOn6r79gp3pbd6vM.html
12-06-2020||India||Use mobile data to keep tabs on home quarantine patients: Govt||The Centre on Thursday asked states to use technology like mobile phone tracking to keep a tab on people under home quarantine after the issue of difficulties in tracking such people was raised at a meeting Union cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba chaired with representatives of the state governments, officials said.Issues like exorbitant fee charged by private hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients when government hospital beds are scarce were also discussed. Central government officials pointed out that Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have capped the fee and others states can follow suit. Telangana’s representative raised the private hospital issue while representatives of West Bengal and Maharashtra spoke about difficulties because of the closure of public transport including metros.Maharashtra chief secretary Ajoy Mehta suggested local trains should be allowed to run. He suggested that offices should not be allowed to operate at full strength and only 15% to 20% of staff should be allowed.Bengal chief secretary Rajeeva Sinha cited the problems in conducting door-to-door tests in slums and highly-populated areas. He also told Gauba it is extremely difficult to keep track of people supposed to be under home quarantine. States, including West Bengal, have directed various categories of people, including patients with mild symptoms, to remain under home quarantine because of a shortage of hospital beds.Gauba pointed out that some states were utilising technology and mobile phones to track people under home quarantine. He said whenever directions are given to people for self-quarantine, the authorities must also give guidance notes. Gauba added that officials in some states were even calling individuals twice daily to ask them about their well-being. The states were also told that if a Covid-19 positive person dies, his or her death should not be attributed to comorbidity alone but identified as Covid-related mortality. They were once again told to improve their ambulance services and ensure that patients do not have to spend hours in the triage areas of hospitals. Maharashtra’s representative said they have set rules to find out lapses and if a person dies within 36 to 48 hours of his or her admission, then it is considered that the surveillance at the district level has failed. Parameters for hospitals, too, have been set, Maharashtra informed the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-mobile-data-to-keep-tabs-on-home-quarantine-patients-govt/story-nREoZEmDBdBxlRbzpJcwbJ.html
12-06-2020||India||Supreme Court to hear plea on treatment of Covid-19 patients||The Supreme Court on Thursday registered a suo motu (on its own) case regarding the issues surrounding the treatment of Covid-19 patients and handling of dead bodies of Covid-19 victims in hospitals.Chief Justice of India (CJI), SA Bobde, took cognizance of the issue and assigned it to a three-judge bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MR Shah that will hear the case on Friday.Former Union law minister Ashwini Kumar had written to the CJI on June 8 highlighting the undesirable manner in which patients and dead bodies were being handled. Kumar pointed out a news report of a Covid-19 patient being chained to a bed in a hospital in Madhya Pradesh. He also drew the attention of the CJI to an incident from Puducherry where a dead body was being thrown into a pit for burial. Right to die with dignity is a fundamental right and it includes the right to a decent burial or cremation, Kumar had said in his letter.This would be the third case which the top court would be hearing suo-motu in relation to issues stemming out of Covid-19.The same three-judge bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan is hearing the case regarding the plight of migrant workers and passed orders to facilitate their return.Another three-judge bench on Thursday took suo-motu notice of the of spread of Covid-19 among 35 children in a government-run child care home in Tamil Nadu and ordered the health secretary to prepare a report on the incident and submit before Monday next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-plea-on-treatment-of-covid-19-patients/story-tcQsFCNq7kaReLNwOQ9XHI.html
12-06-2020||India||Most Indians are still susceptible to Covid-19, finds ICMR survey||By the end of April, only 0.73% of the over 26,000 people across 83 districts of India may have been exposed to the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a study showed, highlighting the slow spread of the pandemic in the country, but also the fact that much of its population is not immune to a disease that still has no cure. To be sure, only part of the findings of the survey have been released; a key part, on the presence of antibodies in so-called hot spots or containment zones, areas most affected by the disease is awaited. Blood samples were taken in May from 26,400 individuals in 28,595 households across 83 districts in 21 states and tested for IgG antibodies that determine a past infection due to the virus, and, therefore, also immunity — according to a few scientists. The results are reassuring as less than 1% population has shown antibodies in the survey that means we have managed to keep the pandemic suppressed successfully. This is a situation around April end as samples were lifted around mid May and it takes about 2 weeks for the results to show,” said VK Paul, chairman, Covid empowered group I, and member (health), Niti Aayog. He also added that the case mortality rate (the proportion of deaths to total Covid-19 cases) in the sample studied was just 0.08%. “This is a big achievement for a country as large as India, and if we continue to keep the loss of life minimal then it will be an accomplishment for the country,” he said. Covid-19 has, around the world, ravaged crowded urban areas and its preference for these was visible to some extent in the study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research, along with National Centre for Disease Control, state health departments and World Health Organization (WHO). Urban areas showed higher Covid-19 prevalence of about 1.09%, and within them, urban slums, 1.89%. “The results show rural areas were largely unaffected, and even overall prevalence was less than 1%; it means that the lockdown and containment measures in the country have been effective, and spread of the virus was slowed down successfully,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, ICMR, while releasing the data at the briefing. To be sure, a repeat of the survey conducted now may throw up a different result. India saw 155,668 new cases of Covid-19 in May, 54% of its current total of 286,953 cases (as on June 10). The month also saw migrant workers returning to their homes in the hinterland from urban centres, potentially carrying the virus with them. The findings of the study also shed light on the immunity of the Indian population. Around the world, limited blood tests for Covid-19 bodies have been used to assess the immunity of the population to the disease. And they have shown that herd or mass immunity is still far away. Stopping further spread is a challenge, say experts. “You have to look at it both ways; if the percentage is low then it means there is a large geographical area where the virus hasn’t gone. Can we contain it like that for ever, and not allow the virus to enter those areas? The immunity in those areas is low, and you have to ensure no infected person goes there ever. Is that even practical or possible?,” asked Dr Shobha Broor, former head, microbiology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. The second part of the study, which may provide details of immunity of the general population in hot spots, may still throw up a surprise. “The data for the second part is still being collated, and what we have seen so far is that infection in containment zones is high with significant variations,” said Dr Bhargava. At the briefing, Dr Bhargava also shared data that compared India’s management of the pandemic with that of other countries. The number of cases and deaths per lakh population in India are also lowest in the world, with 20.77 cases as compared to 91.67 cases globally, and 0.59 deaths in India as opposed to 5.23 deaths in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/most-indians-are-still-susceptible-to-covid-19-finds-icmr-survey/story-jxXvwUJB8kJAbkWktYHf3K.html
12-06-2020||India||‘People, planet, profit’ is PM Modi’s mantra to industry||Reiterating his call to convert the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis into an opportunity to make India self-reliant, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked industry to focus on “people, planet and profit” and create globally competitive supply chains; emphasised on a policy shift from “command and control” to a “plug and play” economy; and urged citizens to promote “local” companies and products. Addressing the 95th annual plenary session of the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in Kolkata over video conference on Thursday, he said the entire world was gripped by the pandemic, and was fighting to overcome it. “But, amidst all this, every Indian citizen is showing a resolve to transform this disaster into an opportunity and to make this into a major turning point,” he said. He defined the turning point as a “self-reliant India”, and claimed that while this had been the aspiration of Indians for several years, it was being pursued in both policies and actions for the last 5-6 years. PM Modi gave a call for an “Atmnirbhar Bharat” in his address to the nation on May 12 when he announced a package of Rs 20 lakh crore to revive the economy that was battered by the pandemic.The PM’s remarks come in the backdrop of official data showing that the Indian economy grew at 3.1% in the last quarter, ending March 31, with growth rate for 2019-2020 slipping to 4.2%, the slowest in 11 years on the back of falling investment and consumption. A sharp fall in gross domestic product (GDP) growth is expected in this fiscal year due to prolonged 68-day lockdown, imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease. The government has focused on self-reliance as the framework to deal with the crisis. In his address, PM Modi said the government will take steps to reduce import dependence and encourage local manufacturing. He urged businessmen to set up globally-competitive domestic supply chains. “This is not the time for a conservative approach. It is time for bold decisions and bold investments,” he said, pointing to how India can lead in the manufacturing of several products such as medical equipment, defence production, solar panels, batteries, chip manufacturing and aviation. In particular, the PM called for reviving the historical superiority of West Bengal in manufacturing, and said, “What Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow.” ICC is the primary business chamber of east and Northeast India, with Kolkata as its base. The BJP is also locked in a fierce political battle with the ruling Trinamool Congress in the state, and is attempting to win power in assembly elections in the state next year. The PM also mentioned how the government’s emphasis on developing clusters for local produce will help the Northeast, which can become a “huge hub for organic farming”. The PM also asked industry to focus on three factors — “people, planet and profit” — and said all the three were interdependent. The PM gave the example of LED bulbs. Five years ago, an LED bulb cost ~350. But the same, he said, was now available for about ~50. This provided relief to the people, saved electricity bills worth ~19,000 crore and protected the environment. He gave another example — of waterways, and said people benefited by using it, logistics costs were reduced, and it was better for the environment. The PM’s other focus was on citizens themselves, and the need to promote local. Quoting Swami Vivekananda, who said that Indians must use their own produce and get markets for Indian products in other countries, the PM said that this path was an inspiration for India in the post-Covid world.The PM’s remarks come even as international agencies and analysts continue to debate the nature of contraction in the Indian economy over the year due to the pandemic. Fitch Ratings on Wednesday forecast a 5% contraction in the GDP this financial year, but said it expected growth to rebound to 9.5% in the next year.S&P Global Ratings, on Wednesday, said that following a 5% contraction in the current fiscal year, the economy was likely to achieve a strong 8.5% growth in the next fiscal year. S&P hoped that the recent structural reforms announced by the government along with fiscal incentives in the “Atmnirbhar Bharat” package would boost the economy. “While risks to India’s long-term growth rate are rising, ongoing economic reforms, if executed well, should keep the country’s growth rate ahead of peers,” it said.Key structural reforms announced recently include credit support for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), allowing marketing freedom to farmers, liberalisation of commercial mining activities, a policy of drawing back the scale of public sector enterprises, and opening up defence and space sectors for private entrepreneurs. Earlier, in September 2019, the government had slashed corporate tax rates to make India a manufacturing destination, which, according to S&P, should “reinforce growth” alongside additional fiscal and monetary easing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-planet-profit-is-pm-modi-s-mantra-to-industry/story-Z0Lz8LGKNVdkRGdxTbCJdP.html
12-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The first 10 days of June have been torrid for India in terms of deaths from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). India recorded 205 deaths on June 1, then 221, 252, 270, 300, 298, 261, 342, 271, on subsequent days and finally 359 on June 10. That’s a total of 2,779 deaths in 10 days, out of a total of 8,107 deaths in the country thus far from the pandemic. The math says it best: India has seen a third of its Covid-19 deaths in the first 10 days of June.The data on deaths from Covid-19 in India has been plagued by two problems: delayed or complete lack of reporting. For instance, Delhi was recognising some deaths that took place in April only in May. According to HT’s database, Delhi’s dashboard listed only 73 deaths till May 11. On June 10, the number stood at 984 — and several of these deaths were old ones that had not been recognised. In some cases hospitals hasn’t reported them; in others they had not reported them in the format prescribed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Earlier this week, The Times of India reported, citing the Chennai corporation’s own data that Tamil Nadu’s count had left out around 236 deaths in the city (from Covid-19) from the state total. Another report in The Indian Express cited an unnamed corporation employee attributing the exclusion to procedural issues arising from inadequate staffing during the lockdown.On Thursday, Delhi’s municipal corporations claimed the actual number of deaths in the state was a little more than double (2,098) of what was being claimed by the AAP government, but at this stage, this is just a claim, albeit one that merits careful investigation and deserves some honest answers from all sides. This column has often argued that, because caseload data is meaningless, the only number that really matters is the daily death toll. Not to spot patterns — the delay in recognising deaths scotches any such effort — but to get a broad understanding of whether things are getting better or worse. The daily deaths since May 1 show that they aren’t getting better for sure — as does the trailing five-day average (both are shown in the accompanying chart). India’s case fatality rate is still less than half the global case fatality rate, but 100 days into its run in the country, the pandemic is clearly yet to peak here.Delays and lapses in recognising deaths, and outright exclusions that are now coming to light, also mean that states once feted for their response to the pandemic may not have done all that well. My reference isn’t as much to Kerala — this column has time and again pointed out that no matter how good the health care system in that state may be, its testing rate is pathetic — as it is to Tamil Nadu and Delhi. For instance, Tamil Nadu’s case fatality rate will increase from 0.88 to 1.52% if the excluded deaths are taken into account. There’s also the question of whether more deaths have been similarly excluded in the state. Delhi’s case fatality rate was just around 1% on May 11, when the national rate was 3.13%. On June 10, Delhi’s death rate was 3%, and the national rate, 2.82%.The ebb and flow of numbers suggests that while there may some outliers, most states eventually veer towards the national average. Another way of looking at it would be that in the large urban centres, the performance of governments in terms of managing Covid-19 is pretty much the same. All their health care systems (not to mention their brave health care and front line workers who have been at it since March) are under strain and nothing, from testing to hospitalisation, is proving to be easy.Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai have to prepare for a coming surge — and they are — but their experience should also be a lesson to other states, especially those that are just beginning to witness a spike. They need to test widely and indiscriminately, trace aggressively, and create dedicated treatment and quarantine facilities that are at least double what their worst-case scenarios project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-L7eFeJxb4qfRn6CZbFyfRI.html
12-06-2020||India||At home with a little help, patients fight Covid-19||Rohini resident Richa Gupta’s husband woke up with a mild fever on May 24 and the family decided to isolate him in one of the rooms of their two-bedroom flat. Two days later, they got themselves tested by a government-run mobile sample collection unit. Her husband and four-year-old son tested positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The family of Richa Gupta, 40, was concerned about her well-being because she suffers from hypertension and severe diabetes that can only be controlled with insulin shots. She is also obese.“I live with my husband, son, sister-in-law, and a full-time help and we have only one bathroom. Initially, we thought of getting admitted to the government facilities but then chose to stay at home as it was more comfortable,” said Gupta. Her husband lives in one of the rooms, she is in another room with her son, and her sister-in-law and the help stay in the living room.Her husband, Pankaj Kumar, 40, had mild fever, sore throat, and headaches. Her son, Vardhan, did not have any symptoms other than some ulcers in his mouth. And she had extreme body ache for a day.One in three of every Covid-19 positive patient in Delhi is currently isolated at home. According to data released by the Delhi government, 13,012 people are under home isolation across the city currently. Home isolation becomes all the more important as the Delhi government works towards scaling up of hospitals beds in preparation for up to 550,000 lcases of Covid-19 it expects in the city by July-end.Only those with mild symptoms – low grade fever, sore throat, headache — and no comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, heart and kidney disease will be allowed to remain in home isolation. Comorbid conditions are known to increase the risk of a person developing severe symptoms of Covid-19.Nobody from the government’s health department visited Richa Gupta’s family to check their condition or their situation. Someone from the district office just put up the Home Isolation sticker on their home and left. But her husband receives a call from the government every other day checking in on his symptoms and psychological well-being. “Not only do they ask him about his fever and other symptoms, they also check how his mood is. We have also been given the number of a doctor who prescribes medicines when necessary,” she said.The family has not been given or prescribed any hydroxychloroquine, which the government’s home isolation guidelines say should be given to the caregivers as prophylaxis to prevent the infection. Their home isolation will end on Saturday.The family learnt how to make 1% hypochlorite solution — a chemical used to disinfect surfaces — on their own and have been using it to sanitise all the surface in each of the rooms twice a day and cleaning the bathroom after a visit by any of the family members. “My husband keeps all his toiletries and clothes with him. He calls out when he needs to use the bathroom, we open the door and switch on the light so that he does not touch the surfaces. After he is done, we spray the hypochlorite solution on all the surfaces and wipe it down with tissues an hour later. We spray the pot after anyone goes,” she said.With everyone in home quarantine, the family also faced problems in getting groceries. “I have subscription with an online grocery store, but they refused to deliver. Even the local grocery stores refused. Initially many of the people in my society also did not help. So, I could not get anything for two days. Now, my neighbours understand my situation and they help me out. They get me everything I need and drop it outside my door,” she said.The civic body collects her garbage every other day. “I sanitise my garbage with the hypochlorite solution and pack it in multiple layers of garbage bags,” she said.With increasing number of Covid-19 patients in home isolation, waste collection is a challenge. “The corporation has been given a list of households where Covid-19 patients live, they collect their garbage separately in a yellow bio-medical waste disposal bag and take it to the proper facilities to be discarded as bio-medical waste,” said one of the district officials on condition of anonymity.The district teams and a private home-care company hired by the Delhi government regularly monitors the condition of the patients.“Only about 7% of those who have been put under home isolation need to be moved to a hospital. The rest can recover on their own at home,” Meena Ganesh, chief executive officer of Portea, the company that has been hired by the Delhi government, told HT in a report published last week.In case they have to be transferred, the district teams are on the ready.“In case the condition of anyone in home isolation deteriorates, we get a distress call immediately and our team rushes an ambulance to the house. However, because of the regular followup we also come to know before-hand whether someone is likely to deteriorate. In addition, in our district, we have created a WhatsApp group of all the people in home isolation and some of our doctors are also on it to answer any query the people might have,” said BM Mishra, district magistrate of south Delhi.Arvind Sehgal, 56, decided to get tested for Covid-19 after feeling breathless. He did not have any fever or other symptoms of Covid-19, but tested positive for the infection on May 29. He has hypertension. Instead of waiting for the government, he hired one of the home-care services – HDU Healthcare.“Once I tested positive, I started looking for such home care services. They have provided me with a nurse and even an oxygen machine. I got better within two days of using oxygen,” he said. He is staying alone in one of the six rooms of his house.He uses utensils that are not used by other members of his family. “We assess every patient who calls us – some of them just need regular teleconsultation, others might need to be hospitalised. We refer them accordingly. However, some people who are not very sick and can recover at home with just oxygen support, we provide them with oxygen concentrator or oxygen cylinder as per their need,” said Dr Dixit Kumar Thakur, consultant of pulmonary critical care with HDU Healthcare.Several Delhi-National Capital Region hospitals such as Max Healthcare, Fortis and Medanta provide such home care to Covid-19 patients with mild to moderate disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-home-with-a-little-help-patients-fight-covid-19/story-wUjD75g6CFFPYqTJnCh1lO.html

The biggest hurdle, according to laboratories, is the cumbersome RT-PCR mobile app, which has made the process of entering test data tedious; but not entering the data isn’t an option. The state government barred some labs from testing because they were not using the app. “Every single detail is documented and sent to the authorities concerned, however, it may not be in the format that the government wants because of logistical issues. If you want to punish well-meaning people for that then there is nothing we can do about it,” said an administrator in a Delhi hospital that treats Covid-19 patients. This person asked not to be identified. The app, which shares its name with the reverse transcription, polymerase chain reaction test which is the gold standard for identifying Covid-19 cases, was launched by the centre on April 30, to remove any discrepancies in sharing of Covid-related data by approved laboratories.The app is meant to be used by labs across India.Data is to be filled at the point and time of sample collection and that poses a problem. The head of a Delhi laboratory that does Covid tests rattled off the issues on condition of anonymity: poor connectivity; the fact that phlebotomists (who collect data) walk, wearing PPEs (personal protective kits) and all to collect samples because it is sometimes difficult to find parking; that they do not want to stay in the infection zone for a minute longer than required but feeding data through the app takes about 10 minutes extra. “The attrition rate of phlebotomists has gone up. It’s difficult to find new ones,” this person added. It’s not as if it is easier to do this with inpatients in hospitals, said the head of a laboratory at a private hospital who asked not to be named. “Imagine a nurse going inside the ICU with a mobile phone to feed in patient data at the time of sample of collection. You cannot do it later because you get a one-time password in the patient’s phone that you have to quickly feed in. These practical problems nobody seems to think about.” Before the introduction of mobile-based application, labs were feeding patient data into web portals created by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and respective state governments. The head of another Delhi laboratory who too spoke on condition of anonymity said “mobile phones can be potential carriers of disease-causing microorganisms.” “I don’t carry my phone while stepping out these days because there is enough evidence to show how mobile phones can be carriers of disease-causing microbes including viruses. The phone surface can be contaminated and can act as a source of infection,” says Dr Shobha Broor, former head of microbiology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.The cumbersome data entry process and the paperwork involved means laboratories get to test fewer patients, said the head of a third Delhi laboratory who asked not to be named. “It takes about 10-12 hours from the point of sample collection to a report getting ready, and most of the time is spent in paperwork, which makes for a huge volume of work in a day. It’s but natural then that it will affect the number of tests being done in a day leading to fewer tests being done.” Some laboratories have hired data entry operators specifically for doing Covid-19 related paperwork. “I have hired some 100 operators for the purpose to handle the huge work load that technicians are not trained to do,” a lab owner added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-delhi-s-testing-figures-stay-low-labs-blame-centre-s-app/story-se99V8p1r9KVOEGs7Q3ywM.html
12-06-2020||India||Odisha sisters tonsured in village kangaroo court for feasting with tribals||Two women in southern Odisha district of Koraput were allegedly tonsured by their village elders as punishment over allegations that they took part in a feast organised by a tribal and going against the practices of their community.Officials in Koraput said sisters Sumati Mali and Shanti Mali of Kadali Maliguda village in Jeypore block of Koraput were tonsured last month following a guilty verdict by a few village elders in a kangaroo court for attending a community feast of a local tribal.Though the incident happened last month, it only came to notice after other leading members of Mali community lodged a complaint with the Koraput district administration.The Malis are other backward caste found among the Hindus and have traditionally worked as gardeners and florists. The community in Odisha was earlier known for its strict practices including not allowing any community member to dine with other communities or tribes. In the undivided Koraput district, the number of Mali community people would be around 1 lakh.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesJeypore sub-collector Loknath Dalbehera said he received a complaint from Koraput Zilla Mali Samaj Vikash Parishad about two sisters being tonsured by some elders of their community. “This is condemnable act. We would take strict action against the villagers who are involved in the incident,” he said.President of Koraput Zilla Mali Samaj Vikas Parishad, Dasarath Mali said the two girls were forcibly tonsured by some members of Mali community on May 17 as penance for their alleged participation in a community feast of a Gadba tribal in the area.“The father of the two sisters died on May 7. As the Mali community members kept ostracising them, the two sisters were forced to cremate their father by themselves. During the 10th day ritual of the father’s rites, the Mali community leaders insisted that the two sisters be tonsured. Though the two girls pleaded innocence, the villagers did not take any pity and tonsured them,” said Mali, before terming it a criminal act.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“The Mali community does not approve of such acts. Besides, our community never penalises anyone for eating at the house of tribals or other communities,” he added.Sumati Mali, 28, the eldest of the two sisters is a widowed mother who stayed with her father after the death of her husband. Both Sumati and younger sister Shanti Mali work as NREGS workers. After their heads were tonsured the two girls are finding it difficult to step out of their homes. They have been forced to cover their heads in towels.“Does anyone tonsure a girl? This is criminal. The people who have forced the two girls should be arrested for illegal confinement as well as other sections of law,” said Ramakant Roul, a social activist of Jeypore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-sisters-tonsured-in-village-kangaroo-court-for-feasting-with-tribals/story-h3kOMq23hylyJhejOQwyHN.html

12-06-2020||India||Odisha bans congregation during Raja festival in view of Covid-19 pandemic||Coronavirus pandemic cast its shadow over Raja, one of the most popular festivals at the onset of monsoon, with a district administration of Odisha banning any kind of congregation between June 11 and June 16.The Keonjhar district administration in an order said any kind of gathering for celebrations like Raja Doli, Mela, Mahostav, feast and traditional games related to Raja festival is strictly prohibited between June 11 and 16 in the mineral-rich district. The festival, a tribute to menstruation of girls, is celebrated between June 14 and 16 when girls wear new clothes and swing away in mango orchards.While Raja is a quite popular festival in most places of Odisha, in Keonjhar district it is celebrated on a bigger scale. At Jalabang area of the district, thousands of people throng to witness Rajabati marriage in which clay idols of Goddess Rajabati and her groom are married. A community feast is organized and people put up swings such as ‘Ram Doli’, ‘Charki Doli’, ‘Pata Doli’ and ‘Dandi Doli’.In Sitabinj area of the district, people come in large numbers to have a glimpse of goddess Sita, and the twins-Laba and Kusha in a small temple during the festival. Legend has been that Goddess Sita stayed here when she was forsaken by Lord Rama and she gave birth to Laba and Kusha here.Though it is still not clear if any other districts would issue orders like Keonjhar district administration, a government spokesperson said people need to be responsible while celebrating Raja. “Control, carefulness, responsibility are the broader messages of Raja festival. We should adhere to these principles while celebrating Raja this time amid the pandemic,” said Odisha government’s Covid spokesperson Subroto Bagchi.The state government however on Thursday announced relaxation in the night curfew from 7 pm to 10 pm on June 12 to help them do shopping for Raja festival. Special Relief Commissioner Pradip Jena however said all other conditions such as social distancing and masks would have to be strictly followed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-bans-congregation-during-raja-festival-in-view-of-covid-19-pandemic/story-RJ5wRVMWXGjdyZYVjVAoKK.html
12-06-2020||India||Covid-19 kills 5 out of every 100 patients in 69 districts, triggers concern||Although the case fatality rate (CFR) has marginally dipped to 2.90% of the total number of Covid-19 cases since May 18, when the government eased lockdown norms, 69 districts in the country have CFR of 5% or more, which Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba termed as an issue of concern at a meeting with states on Wednesday, government officials said.Gauba gave a detailed presentation on the overall Covid-19 status in India as on June 9 and the challenges that have emerged since the government eased lockdown restrictions, amid state governments re-imposing lockdown curbs to control the spread of coronavirus in some states such as Rajasthan, Mizoram and Uttar Pradesh.“The case fatality rate has remained flat at 2.90% as compared to 2.96% on May 18,” the Cabinet Secretary said, indicating that there was not much reason to worry as India’s case fatality rate was lower than several western countries.The number of Covid-19 cases increased from 1,00,800 on May 18 to 2,87,155 on June 10 and the number of deaths jumped from 3,156 to 8,108 in this period.On the state specific Covid-19 data, Gauba said that 82% of all the deaths have been reported from five states --- Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh --- which also have high Covid-19 case load, though most of the deaths have occurred because of co-morbid reasons.The Cabinet Secretary also highlighted that 69 districts in the country reported more than 5% of the case fatality rate, terming it an “issue of concern.” Of them, the presentation said, the highest number of districts were in Madhya Pradesh (21), followed by Uttar Pradesh (11), Gujarat (9), Rajasthan (5) and Telangana (3). Shahdara and North-East districts in Delhi, Jind in Haryana, Kapurthala in Punjab and Bastar in Chhattisgarh with high CFR.On the total number of cases, the Cabinet Secretary said the five states that accounted for 82% of the deaths, also reported the highest rate of increase in Covid-19 cases between May 18 and June 9, resulting in the total cases in India increasing by almost 170% during this period. These states also had more than 70% of the cases in the country, the presentation said.All India Institute of Medical Sciences Director, Randeep Guleria, said India’s Covid Fatality Rate was much lower than the WHO’s prescribed limit of 3% to 3.5%. “In the districts or states having high mortality rate, the local administrations need to focus on surveillance of elderly patients with other diseases. Detailed guidelines on the same have been circulated with the state governments,” he said. Among 736 districts in the country, the presentation said, 14 districts accounted for 60% of the total Covid-19 cases in the country. Half of the districts were in the National Capital Region (NCR), including five districts of Delhi, Gurugram and Gautam Budh Nagar. Other districts were Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Pune, Thane, Chengalpattu, Ahmedabad and Kolkata, the presentation said.Some of these districts have also seen the fastest increase in Covid-19 cases since easing of restrictions on May 18, the presentation said. “These are the districts which have more than 400 cases, of which 50% of the cases have been reported after May 18. These districts are concentrated in 7 states – Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Karnataka, Jammu and Kashmir and Haryana,” the presentation said. It also pointed out that Gurugram, Udupi, Yadgir and Kolhapur have reported 90% of the 400 plus cases since May 18.On the basis of district-wise analysis of the rate of increase of Covid-19 cases, the health ministry has identified 50 districts that may face shortage of hospital beds by the first week of July. Of them, the presentation said 17 districts have high probability of witnessing shortage of hospital beds. These districts are Mumbai, Thane, Palgar, Jalgaon and Raigarh in Maharashtra, Udupi, Raichur and Yadgir in Karnataka, Kulgam and Kupwara in Jammu and Kashmir, Bharatpur in Rajasthan, Gautam Budh Nagar in Uttar Pradesh and Chennai, Chengalpattu, Thiruvallur and Turicorin in Tamil Nadu, the presentation said.On the Covid-19 confirmation rate (positives for total Covid-19 tests done), the presentation said three states --- Maharashtra, Delhi and Telangana --- has confirmation rate of more than 10% as compared to 5.70% national rate, which has increased by almost one percentage point since May 18. “The increase in confirmation rate (between May 18 and June 9) indicates at either increase in spread of coronavirus or lower testing during this period,” the presentation said. On the district-wise analysis, the presentation said that 46 districts in 13 states have a confirmation rate of more than 10% with the highest number of districts (12) in Maharashtra followed by nine in Delhi.The presentation also pointed out that there was a huge turnaround time for getting test results in several districts, especially in the rural areas. HT had reported that Jharkhand and Bihar were taking up to 14 days to provide results of the tests taken at the quarantine centers. “The delay is because of the sudden increase in the swabs being taken,” said Jharkhand health secretary Nitin Kulkarni. Bihar health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh said the pendency of the tests results is reducing as swabs of most of the symptomatic persons in quarantine centers have been taken.On the positive side, the Cabinet Secretary said that the doubling rate has increased to 16.9 days from earlier 14.1 days and the national fatality rate was still below 3%. He also said that the spread of Covid-19 cases to newer districts was not very high and the situation there was under control. Gauba said that several districts have reported slowing down of Covid-19 cases, which indicated that the lockdown had a positive impact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-india-69-districts-have-case-fatality-rate-double-than-that-of-national-average-govt/story-G9CbhYYu8EneRQUPEjfDbK.html
12-06-2020||India||PM Oli convenes special sitting to clear new map; India to cold-shoulder him||Nepal’s parliament will hold a special meeting on Saturday to complete voting on a new political map that redraws its border with India. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s push to get parliament to hold a special sitting on a public holiday - Saturday is the weekly public holiday in Nepal - is seen as an effort to signal his determination to escalate the boundary row with India.The new map shows Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani - a sliver of land counted as part of India’s Uttarakhand in the older maps - to be in northwestern Nepal.Nepal’s lower house had backed the constitution amendment bill that formalises the new map on Tuesday this week. But before lawmakers can vote on the bill, parliamentary procedures require the legislature to give 72 hours to allow any MP to move an amendment. No amendments have been proposed so far, people familiar with the development in Kathmandu told Hindustan Times.The 72-hour period ends on Friday evening.An India official said the fact that PM Oli did not wait for parliament’s next working day to take up the legislation on the new map speaks volumes about his intentions.Also read | In Nepal’s map tactics, a reflection of China’s growing footprint in KathmanduPM Oli, who has been facing pressure from his rivals within the ruling party, came up with the surprise move last month within 10 days of India formally opening a road to Lipulekh Pass for Kailash Mansarovar pilgrims.In Delhi and Kathmandu, the new map has been seen as an attempt by the Communist Party of Nepal leader to consolidate public support behind him and whip up ultra-nationalistic sentiments.The announcement, which came around the same time that a standoff between India and China was at its peak, is also seen to have the blessings of Beijing’s communist party.In April this year when PM Oli had issued two ordinances to amend the anti-defection law to blunt a political offensive launched by his detractors, China got him to scrap the changes within five days. Chinese president Xi Jinping’s emissaries told PM Oli that he should not allow the communist party to be split over their differences.India has described PM Oli’s map as a “unilateral act” that was not based on historical facts or evidence and asked Kathmandu to “refrain from such unjustified cartographic assertion” for an “artificial enlargement of territorial claims”.To be sure, Prime Minister Oli told lawmakers on Wednesday that he had sought talks to resolve the dispute with India.“We have told (them) that we want to resolve this through diplomatic talks ... And the solution is that our land should be returned to us,” Oli said in parliament on Wednesday. He also deplored Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s comment that asked Nepal to think through the long-term consequences of its decision and asked Kathmandu to remember what happened to Tibet.Indian officials have also told Hindustan Times that New Delhi had taken note of the developments around the map and stressed that parliamentary approval would seal any possibility of dialogue between the two sides on the “dispute manufactured by Kathmandu”.But do not expect many harsh statements from the government, one of them said, suggesting that New Delhi was more likely to go for the silent treatment as far as the Nepal leadership is concerned but keep its focus on cementing ties with the people of Nepal.That approach was on display in New Delhi on Thursday when external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava was asked about the developments around the map. Srivastava spoke about friendly relations between the two countries and India’s cooperation via-a-vis Covid-19. But on the map, he refused to say much except to stress that New Delhi had already made its position clear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-pm-oli-out-to-prove-a-point-convenes-special-sitting-to-clear-lipulekh-map/story-3fTSpvUIZZcrFLkrn5BynL.html

As far as India goes, our stimulus package is as large as the GDP of Pakistan,” said Anurag Srivastava, spokesperson for the foreign affairs ministry.Also Read: Twitter abuzz with anxious users claiming IAF activity over PakistanImran Khan had earlier today tweeted a news report published in an Indian daily highlighting the suffering of a section amongst the poor in India due to the economic challenges posed by the Covid outbreak, and he claimed that his government was willing to help with its “successful cash transfer programme”, which he boasted was recognised internationally.For Coronavirus Live Updates“Acc to this report, 34% of households across India will not be able to survive for more than a week without add (sic) assistance. I am ready to offer help & share our successful cash transfer prog, lauded internationally for its reach & transparency, with India,” Pak PM Imran Khan had tweeted.Khan went on to claim that his government had transferred a total of Rs 120 billion to over 10 million families in a “transparent” manner to deal with the cash crunch faced by the poor due to the pandemic outbreak.“Our govt successfully transferred Rs. 120 billion in 9 weeks to over 10 million families in a transparent manner to deal with the COVID19 fallout on the poor,” he added.India on the other hand had announced an economic assistance package worth over Rs 20,000 crore which is 10% of India’s GDP to assist businesses and individuals in mitigating the hardship resulting from the economic impact of coronavirus induced lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-mentions-pakistan-s-gdp-in-stinging-reply-to-imran-khan-s-help-offer/story-ROujvhxMqLMjXtSucphkKI.html
12-06-2020||Editorials||What the PM did not say | HT Editorial||In an address to the Indian Chamber of Commerce on Friday, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi reiterated his call for a self-reliant India. He urged Indian industry to think and act boldly; he asked citizens to buy local and went back to Swami Vivekananda to emphasise how Indians buying domestic products and getting outsiders to buy local products is an effective remedy; he outlined manufacturing possibilities; and he spoke about the inter-connections between people, profits and the planet. The pandemic has highlighted the close linkages between people and nature. The PM, through his term, has often spoken about placing environmental consciousness at the heart of India’s future. This is laudable — though many will ask why this principle is often not reflected in practice, given the rapid clearances provided by the environment ministry to projects that may have adverse consequences. This is the first gap between his messaging and policy which must be addressed. In the immediate context, it is important to examine the PM’s repeated emphasis on self-reliance. This has merit. At a time when protectionism is rising across the world, countries are turning more insular, and local industry needs all the support it can get, the principle is understandable. While the PM has spoken of how this does not mean getting divorced from global supply chains, the government has not yet clarified — in detail — how this will be reconciled with the deliberate objective of reducing foreign imports and how other countries will be persuaded to remain open to India, even as India closes its doors. This is the second gap between principle and policy which must be addressed. But the most significant gap is between the PM’s optimism for the future — which is indeed a morale-booster — and the grim economic reality that exists today. A range of international agencies now predict a severe contraction in the Indian economy, of 5% or more. The economic package announced by the government lacked the fiscal measures needed to pump up demand. And there is a widespread consensus that till demand rises, businesses, supply chains, employment and tax revenues will not bounce back. And until that happens, India will not be able to achieve its high growth potential. On the environment, on global interlinkages, and most critically, on India’s economic future, the government must offer more clarity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/what-the-pm-did-not-say/story-1nZD8pkP4GijuAcETNjpPP.html
