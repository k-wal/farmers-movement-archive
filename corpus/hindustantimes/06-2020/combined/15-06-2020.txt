15-06-2020||News||It is time to tap potential of handicrafts and textiles||India has an estimated 16 million craftspeople, living mainly in rural India, who are actively involved in some of the most complex textile processes that the world has ever seen. This is not an insignificant number. These craftspeople constitute a highly-skilled workforce, with huge knowledge of specialised processes, learnt from master craftsmen, who ran guilds over centuries, of complex designs. It was in the 1960s that I discovered the art of gold embroidery in a rural setting, in small villages in West Bengal, where the craft was being practised. It is said that the origin of the craft was Iran, and it came to India during the Sultanate. The embroideries from these villages were once patronised by the Nawabs of Bengal. India is replete with village workshops like these, which cannot survive without financing and infrastructure.After the coronavirus pandemic, the reality is that the handloom and handcraft sector in India needs a way to survive. There is no relevance today in government-run emporiums.Our philosophy is completely wrong. A superior handloom product, aesthetically appealing as well as ecologically-friendly, cannot be sold out of compassion but needs the modern technology of marketing and retailing, and needs to be projected as the best in the world. This is the only way to survive in a competitive market.A fact not commonly known is that the textile sector is the second largest employer in rural India, after agriculture. India was the world’s largest supplier of textiles 200 years ago. By 1947, this was converted into a nation using copies of its own textiles, in bulk from England’s industrial areas. This bankrupted India’s rich craft economies is causing destitution in India’s rural markets.It is a miracle that post-Independence, due to the government’s efforts to revive heritage crafts, India has been able to recreate many of its forgotten textile crafts. This was forward-thinking at its best and was not easily achieved. It took a sustained and progressive, revival movement to save India’s handmade legacy. This was successfully launched with a series of the “Viswakarma” exhibitions, which displayed the sophisticated creations of this revival in prestigious museums. The programme generated a great degree of excitement, and the affluent middle-class became the biggest patron of these textiles. This was unlike in many other countries where priceless textiles were relegated to dusty museums. In India, these creations, and not fashion from the international ramps, became aspirational garments for urban consumers, especially women.In an effort to create interest in Indian crafts internationally, the “Vishwakarma” exhibitions were exhibited through the Festivals of India in the most-prestigious museums around the world capitals. This highlighted the richest traditions of handcrafts left in the world. This again caught the attention of the fashion fraternity abroad. India was once again on the world fashion map. Over the last two decades, the Indian fashion industry has made strides. And unlike the rest of the world, it boasts of an indigenous team of designers. These do not necessarily mean only those who show on the ramps, but also those present in the rural fields. They are weavers, embroiderers and creators of embellishments, which no one in the world can create. Most of Indian couture and its glamorisation can be attributed to the handmade crafts. In India, the garments from maharajahs and royal pageants serve as a theme to Big and Small Indian Weddings. Their imitations have flooded malls, boutiques, village haats and bazaars across smaller markets. Each has its own version, creating a theatrical, Indian ethnic fashion. With the recessionary trend that the pandemic is causing, it is time for the government to step in, as they did in the 1950s, to save India’s handicrafts. The drop in the retail of high-end merchandise will temper the scale of celebrations. Most high-end production will move from hand-made to mechanised alternatives.The world today produces textiles using sophisticated machinery. India’s vast repertoire of designs may end up being used only as an inspiration, as is the case with China, which produces copies of the woven Benares saris, among a host of other textile merchandise, and sells these at a fraction of the price to India. This has destroyed the handloom market in Varanasi. After the pandemic, we have a real problem of livelihood on our hands here, as well as one of the intellectual property of textiles which is facing a real threat. The government has to think outside the box, step in and support start-ups. This is a lucrative market. It can be run and marketed by a professionally-run organisation, with cutting-edge pricing, which also offers retail spaces on the internet. The only way to do this is to become a conduit to the customer to buy directly from the craftsman which would involve minimal overheads. It can easily be achieved. Let us look at the USP of this sector. Handicrafts can be best generated in agrarian set-ups. They do not necessitate a move from the rural to the urban scenario, hence avoiding the ghettoisation of its inheritors.It requires little investment in production infrastructure or skill development. It will be the only Made in India by Hand brand in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/it-is-time-to-tap-potential-of-handicrafts-and-textiles/story-x4XHs0eZKNUrdfCnjCo2aK.html
15-06-2020||News||Build a new economic imagination||This has been a difficult three months for India. The policy response to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and the lockdown has forced it to confront long-ignored realities about the Indian economy — its fragility, regional and spatial concentration and deep structural inequity. It also made visible sources of precarious resilience. Agriculture and associated supply chains, for instance, held together despite significant disruption and fall in demand. Now, as India unlocks and the focus shifts to repair and reform, policy debates must contend with these realities. India cannot repair and reform without acknowledging its economic failures. Doing so places accepted pathways for growth, shaped by the 1991 moment, back in contention. Coming off the stifling restrictions of the licence raj, the need to get the State out of the way was central to the 1991 imagination. Deregulation, market competition and opening up were the key mantras. This was a necessary element for economic reform. However, in its exuberance, the push for a smaller State failed to recognise that deregulation was not about State exit but about a changing role for the State and building a new economic regulatory architecture. This required more, not less, investment in State capacity — human resources and institutional systems, including processes for public accountability and dispute resolution. The pre-pandemic slowdown was, in part, a consequence of this failure to build regulatory capacity; our post-pandemic reforms run a similar risk.Consider the three agricultural ordinances promulgated earlier this month. The underlying objective to liberalise agriculture markets and give farmers greater choice is welcome. However, experience in states such as Bihar point out that deregulation, without investments in markets, does not automatically spur competition. Rather, this risks the proliferation of brokers. Infrastructure for wholesale agricultural markets is woeful and farmers have few avenues to directly sell produce. According to government estimates, India needs more than 3,500 wholesale markets and its 23,000 rural periodic markets need urgent infrastructure upgradation. Opening up agricultural markets to greater competition must also be accompanied by State investments in creating market infrastructure, information systems and building credible and responsive regulatory institutions that enable fair exchange and trade. This is in no way unique to agriculture. Across key sectors and in core factor market reforms, the State has a critical role to play.However, regulatory capacity is only one part of the challenge. As the lockdown shows, markets in India operate in a context of deep structural and regional inequalities. These inequalities necessitate State interventions in infrastructure, in incentivising supply chain investments, managing risk and enhancing bargaining power. This is where the State has been at its weakest. The State’s failure to build these markets lies in an economic imagination that viewed the economy in false binaries that emphasised trade-offs between farm vs non-farm, rural vs urban, formal vs informal. In pursuit of an economy that was non-farm, urban and formal, it failed to understand the deep links across these binaries and design responsive policy. This is best illustrated in the approach to agriculture and growth. Consider the following: First, where agriculture has been invested in, agricultural surplus has played an important role in driving industrialisation and moving people off the farm. The history of India’s industrial hubs such as Tiruppur, Tamil Nadu, which grew on the back of agrarian capital are testimony to this. Second, half of India’s manufacturing value addition and off-farm employment (Census 2011) is in rural areas. Third, urbanisation is fuelled by changing economic patterns in these rural areas as non-farm employment increases. Half of India’s new urban population growth between 2001-2011 (Census 2011) is in these rural areas that morphed into towns. Agriculture, non-farm rural and urbanisation are inextricably linked. In the policy preoccupation with moving people out of agriculture, the economic narrative failed to recognise these interlinkages treating agriculture as a residue, a drag on the economy and rural, non-farm and urban as silos. We have separate agriculture, rural, urban and micro, small and medium enterprises departments and no mechanism for strategic planning and coordination across them. Urban policies and spending has prioritised “smart” cities and metropolises rather than investing in small towns (many of which are still classified as rural) and cities where the bulk of economic activity takes place. Local governments, which ought to play a critical role, are weak, leaving behind largely the more pernicious elements of the license raj State that exploit the very inequalities the lockdown made visible.Addressing India’s structural inequalities and making markets genuinely competitive requires an integrated economic framework, which breaks silos and invests in the continuum of agriculture, rural, non-farm and urban. This means investing in and incentivising State capacities to collect better data on agriculture, non-farm sectors, and urbanisation, for decentralised, local economic planning and investment. Finally, the lockdown must lay to rest the old debate on trade-offs between welfare and growth. Welfare, because of its political imperatives, was always treated as an afterthought in the post-1991 imagination, a compensation for the failure to bring people in as active participants in the economy. As is well recognised in economic literature, robust welfare builds human capabilities, enhances productivity and most importantly ensures dignity. Welfare needs to be re-imagined as the foundation of a strong economy and the capabilities needed for delivering welfare must be enhanced. If India is to find its way back on a growth trajectory, economic policymaking will need to acknowledge the failures of its past. Yet, our current reform imagination, as indicated in the Covid-19 economic package, remains trapped in false binaries and old frameworks. India’s economic imagination needs to be refocused on the real economy. Crucially, growth needs a robust and capable State across all levels. Investing in State capacity and its regulatory institutions rather than wishing the State away will ultimately be the real driver of growth.

Data further showed that most of the deceased were above 60 years in age and had contracted the SARS-CoV-2 virus from the hospital while undergoing treatment for other health issues.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of the district, said, “Most of the fatalities were seen in people above the age of 60. Their immunity was compromised due to other health issues like diabetes, hypertension, cancer, tuberculosis and asthma. They all had co-morbid conditions. Only one or two cases did not have any health issues and yet succumbed to the illness.” On May 31, the total death count in the district was three. The number had climbed to 37 by Monday. Yadav said that contact tracing shows that most of the people who contracted the virus had visited hospitals for other ailments and got contaminated there. Yadav, who is also the head of the Covid-19 death audit committee, said, “The team has done contact tracing of the people who died due to coronavirus and in most of cases it has been found that they had visited hospitals for treatment of other diseases and got infected. It is suggested that people, especially elderly, should not visit a hospital until it is absolutely necessary,” he said. A total of 100 deaths have been reported in the state so far. Gurugram alone accounts for 41% of the Covid-19 burden of the state. Over 7,722 cases have been reported in the state, out of which Gurugram accounts for 3,477 cases. Of these 3,477, at least 1,664 are still active cases. Data shows, the hospitalisation ranged from 311 to 465 in the last six days. Out of which 27% patients were put on oxygen support and 10% on ventilator support. Patients, who were put on oxygen support fluctuated between 68 to 143, while those put on ventilator were from 31-48 from June 10 to 15. To tackle the inflow of critical patients, 180 — of the 335 total ventilators in different hospitals of the district— have been reserved for Covid-19 patients .Vivek Kalia, nodal officer, hospital and ventilator management, said, “Based on our projections, nearly 80% of the active cases will need isolation beds, 15% will need general ward beds and 5% ICU beds. But we will be considering the peak numbers as cases continue to increase. Covid-19 cases can exceed 10,000 mark by the end of the month. We have already directed private hospitals to reserve 25% beds for Covid patients. More ventilators will also be requisitioned.”Earlier this week, Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner issued an order directing hospitals above 50-bed capacity to reserve 25% of their beds for Covid-19 patients. With this, the overall bed capacity in Gurugram has reached a count of 1,150. As per the projections made by Kalia’s team, if hospitals are directed to reserve 50% bed, the count will reach 2,300. If, however, the cases grow at 12-15%, the city would require 4,000 -,5000 beds. In August, if the cases increase to almost a lakh, the requirement would be of at least 37,000 beds and more than 2,000 ventilators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/34-covid-deaths-in-last-two-weeks-worries-district-health-officials/story-Df0pI2NIQWr5CvMSiXvsMI.html

So far, 50 Gurugram police have tested positive for Covid-19. The police personnel are involved in enforcing the rules in the containment zones, in hospital duties and borders which leaves them vulnerable.At present, of the police personnel deployed across the city, 500 are above the age of 50 years while 1,000 are between the ages of 40 and 50 years. These have been asked to work from office spaces and have not been assigned outdoor tasks, said the police.Officials said at least 4,500 police personnel in the district are under the age of 40 years. There are around 6,000 police personnel in total, apart from 990 special police officers and 1,060 home guards deployed across the city.Police commissioner Muhammad Akil said they have decided to deploy police personnel above 50 years of age indoors where they will not be dealing with the public and will have minimum direct contact with people, considering their higher vulnerability to being infected with the Sars-Cov-2 virus. “I have asked the deputy commissioner of the areas concerned to prepare the data of personnel deployed in their jurisdictions with details of their current deployment. We will finalise the rotation of duties after analysing the data,” he said.Akil said meanwhile, the district police shall not, to the best extent possible, deploy personnel with enhanced medical risk factors, be it age or pre-existing medical conditions. “We are taking all due precautions and are regularly advising our staff about the safety protocols against the pandemic,” he said.The initiative was taken after a 58-year-old inspector, posted in Gurugram, succumbed to Covid-19 at a private hospital in Sector 51 on June 10. He was the first police personnel to die of Covid-19 in the district.Seeing a rise in the number of coronavirus cases among police personnel, the health department had screened nearly 600 personnel, deployed across the city for lockdown duties, thrice in the past 14 days. Also, around 600 family members of police personnel living at police lines in Gurugram and Manesar were screened after some policemen tested positive in the first week of June.Police said of the 50 personnel who tested positive, 40 are presently in home-isolation while the rest are at a quarantine facility at police lines in Manesar. “We had set up the isolation ward in a newly constructed building in Manesar to safeguard the force and their family members from vulnerability to the Covid-19 infection. All facilities are provided to the force to tackle this tough situation,” said Akil.The officer also said that all police personnel deployed on high risk duties are provided with body protective gear, triple-layer masks, gloves and sanitisers.Akil said that the police officers deployed at hot spots, containment zones, Isolation wards, Covid hospitals are directed to wear PPE suits, which are certified by the Union ministry of health.“Policemen, who come in close contact with patients while carrying out debriefing, contact tracing or tracking positive patients, are being screened by the health department and samples of their family members and close contacts are being collected,” he said.The Gurugram police force currently has nearly 3 lakh face masks, 1.5 lakh gloves, 2 lakh hand sanitizers and 30,000 soaps and hand washes in stock.Akil said all efforts were being made to ensure that police personnel are safe from the Covid-19 infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-cops-susceptible-to-covid-to-be-kept-away-from-outdoor-duties/story-3JUZ4HKUTy4V7NoX5iJRGN.html
15-06-2020||Gurugram||Cabbie gangs resurface as travel curbs eased||Following the easement of curbs on travel, ‘cabbie gangs’ that rob commuters along the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, by offering shared rides, have resurfaced, the police said. At least three such incidents were reported last week and the police have registered FIRs in the cases.The police said the gangs have been targeting commuters at Iffco Chowk, Rajiv Chowk and Shankar Chowk.A police official from the crime branch, requesting anonymity, said, “With the borders opening up and restrictions on lockdown relatively eased, the gangs are operational again. The commuter is typically picked up from a busy stretch on the highway and offered a drop to Delhi, Sohna, Nuh and regions bordering the city for ₹40-50. Shortly after, the car deviates from the route and the victim is asked to hand over his phone and reveal his ATM Pin, often at gunpoint. In certain cases, the victims are assaulted, gagged and threatened with knives. They are dropped several hours later in a deserted area.”Earlier this week, an accountant was taken hostage in a cab and robbed of ₹87,000 after he had taken a cab from Iffco Chowk. On June 8, Praveen Kumar, a Delhi resident, who works at a construction company in Manesar, was waiting for a cab at Iffco Chowk when a vehicle pulled up, offering him a ride. Two men were sitting in the vehicle. After driving for a few metres, one of them, who had a gun, started assaulting Kumar and asked him to handover his watch, mobile phone, wallet and ring. He was later dropped on the highway.Most people rely on shared cab rides due to lack of public and private transport options and cheaper fares.Kanhai Ram, a victim of a snatching incident at Rajiv Chowk on Saturday, said, “Uber and Ola cabs are available but they are expensive and sometimes, refuse the commute to the destination, citing lockdown restrictions. The Metro is still not operational. I have to depend on the shared cab rides to commute to work as it is cheap and convenient,” said Ram.Subash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “At least three crime branch teams have been tasked with surveillance of key stretches to nab the accused. It is not certain if the same gang is behind these recent incidents or multiple gangs are involved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cabbie-gangs-resurface-as-travel-curbs-eased/story-ZGgAer6UcYfk27V2kqyaCJ.html
15-06-2020||Gurugram||MCG to dump fresh waste at a new site in Farrukhnagar for a year||To process the existing legacy waste at the city’s Bandhwari landfill, the dumping of fresh waste at the landfill is likely to come to a complete halt from next month onward for one year, said Vinay Pratap Singh, Commissioner, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), on Monday. Approximately, 1,100 tonnes of daily waste produced by the city will instead be dumped and processed at a Farrukhnagar landfill during this period.The shift in the dumping of waste is supposed to take place in a staggered manner as initially, the MCG is likely to use both the facilities, “After two weeks, as MCG officials get accustomed to the new facility, we will stop dumping the waste at the Bandhwari landfill,” Singh said.Earlier this year, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had set a late-2020 deadline for the MCG to treat 28 lakh tonnes of legacy waste, accumulated over the past 12 years, at the Bandhwari plant. “The NGT had asked the civic body to bio-remediate the entire legacy waste at Bandhwari plant by the end of this year. However, this target was set before the national lockdown came into effect and, consequently, the machinery for processing the legacy waste got delayed. As such, an alternative site for dumping fresh waste had to be found by both the MCG and Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF),” said Singh. Another reason prompting MCG to look for an alternative site was to escape an environmental penalty being imposed by the NGT if no solution was found to the Bandhwari legacy waste, said senior MCG officials privy to the matter. At the Bandhwari landfill, nearly 1,900 tonnes of waste is dumped daily by Gurugram and Faridabad together. In August 2017, a report by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) found that the leachate overflow from the waste had resulted in contaminating the groundwater in a few areas in Faridabad, Gurugram, and south Delhi — all falling within a 10km radius of the landfill. Singh said that MCF has also found an alternative site within their district to process the waste for Faridabad. Yash Garg, the MCF commissioner, said that the civic body is in the process of setting up a temporary processing plant near Sector 49 in Faridabad that is expected to be fully operational within the next three months.The MCG will be submitting a report to the NGT on June 20 regarding the progress in the matter, which will be independently reviewed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), said Singh, adding that further said that the next hearing in this matter is scheduled for mid-July. In November last year, MCG had got an approval from the state government to use a 25-acre land at Chand Nagar Ki Dhani Road in Farrukhnagar, located around 30 kilometres from Gurugram, for processing the city’s waste. However, a Farrukhnagar resident approached the judicial court in Pataudi in December 2019 and subsequently a stay order was put on processing the waste at the site, said Singh“Earlier this month, the MCG had appealed on this stay and stated that the absence of processing waste was negatively affecting the residents of Gurugram and was likely to have far-reaching environmental implications. The court vacated the stay and we started our preparation for the new processing site,” said Singh Singh, on Sunday, met with members of the Farrukhnagar Municipal Committee to chalk out the final plan for the project. “I told the members that the move is only a temporary one and we will be bearing the cost of the lease. As a gesture of their support, we also will be incurring the expenses for processing the waste collected by Farrukhnagar Municipal Committee, which will be around ₹80 lakh per year. Also, once we return to the Bandhwari plant, the infrastructure will be left behind for future use by the municipal committee,” he said.Singh said that the MCG will return to the Bandhwari only if a substantial amount of legacy waste is cleared after a year and the landfill has enough space to accommodate fresh waste. “We have received a verbal agreement from the Farrukhnagar Municipal Committee in the matter and a formal agreement will soon be signed,” said Singh.When asked about the matter, KK Yadav, secretary, Farrukhnagar Municipal Committee, said, “Farrukhnagar generates around 6 tonnes of daily waste. We were looking for a way to process it. Thus, when the MCG approached us with the proposal of waste processing, we immediately gave our consent to it as it will mutually benefit both the civic bodies.”Ecogreen, the concessionaire for the city’s waste collection, will dump its waste at the new site and will revert to Bandhwari after a year. “The work on setting up the infrastructure for the waste processing plant at Farrukhnagar is almost over. We are hoping to start the processing of waste either by the end of this week or early next week. While the bio-remediation process will start within the next ten days, the bio-mining of the existing legacy waste will start by mid-July,” Singh said.Bio-remediation refers to the natural decomposition of waste with the help of either microorganisms or chemicals. Bio-mining, on the other hand, refers to the segregation of waste, before the final processing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-dump-fresh-waste-at-a-new-site-in-farrukhnagar-for-a-year/story-LBDtGSoSzzoaJxWKemf1KI.html

The accused persons are yet to be identified, the police said, adding that a probe has been initiated in the case.According to the police, the victim, Rajiv Manchanda, was taken to the civil hospital on June 10 at 5.30pm by his relatives after he was found unconscious at his shop. He was declared dead on arrival and the police had initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of code of criminal procedure. In their statement to the police, his family had said that he was undergoing treatment for a liver ailment and he had fallen ill due to complications related to the same. Later, the post-mortem of body was conducted, whose report was awaited. A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “According to the post-mortem report, the cause of death in this case is asphyxia following ante mortem ligature strangulation. We have registered a case of murder. We are checking the CCTV camera installed in the area to get some clues.”In the statement to the police, the victim’s sister-in-law had said, “After my husband’s death, my brother-in-law was looking after the tent business. He had a liver ailment and had been ill for some time. On June 10 around 5.30pm, I heard that his condition worsened and I informed my nephews, who took him to the civil hospital. He was declared brought dead.”A case was registered against unidentified persons under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of Indian Penal Code at New Colony police station on Sunday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tent-house-owner-was-strangled-to-death-finds-autopsy-report/story-PJC3UQR0crJKMj7eqXOzuM.html
15-06-2020||City||Hindu Rao preps up, will need a day or two to start functioning as Covid facility||New Delhi: The north Delhi municipal corporation-run Hindu Rao hospital has begun preparations to treat coronavirus patients but authorities at the facility said it may take a day or two more to fully start functioning as a Covid set-up as non-Covid patients were yet to be shifted to other hospitals and logistical support was awaited.The Delhi government and the north corporation had on Sunday announced their decision to convert the 980-bedded hospital -- one of the largest in north Delhi -- into a dedicated Covid-19 treatment facility from Tuesday.Senior doctors at the hospital said they might be able to attend Covid-19 patients with mild and moderate symptoms from Tuesday but to treat severe or high-risk patients, they will require logistical support from the government and complete transfer of other patients to other facilities. Hospital authorities, however, began preparations on Monday, discharging many patients and transferring serious cases to other hospitals, sanitising the building and installing thermal scanners, etc.Family members of a few patients complained of hardships in taking their relatives home or to other hospitals. “My father was admitted in the hospital on June 6. He is suffering from pneumonia. Today, the doctors discharged him and asked us to take him home. He is not able to walk. We are not sure if he is okay, so we will take him to another hospital. They should have told us in advance,” Pawan Pawar, a resident of Ashok Vihar said.A senior functionary at the hospital said on anonymity, “We discharged patients not requiring hospital intervention. Those with life-threatening condition are being shifted to other corporation hospitals. The process of transferring patients is on. We still have patients in the medicine, gynaecology and paediatric departments. We can’t properly start Covid-19 treatment unless all patients are shifted. Otherwise, a chance of virus spreading among non-Covid patients will always remain. We might be fully functioning as a Covid-19 hospital by June 18 (Thursday).”Some patients are seriously ill and on ventilators, and so it will take a day or two to shift them, the official said. About 209 patients in different departments were being shifted to Kasturba, Rajan Babu and Giridharilal hospitals.Hindu Rao has 17 ventilators, eight intensive care unit (ICU) beds and four high dependency units (a notch down from ICUs). As many as 250 beds have oxygen support, the civic body said.Delhi government’s health secretary Vikram Dev Dutt had on Sunday declared Hindu Rao as a dedicated Covid-19 facility and directed the medical superintendent to start admitting Covid-19 patients from Tuesday (June 16). The hospital and municipal authorities had conducted an internal meeting to check preparations for converting the hospital into a Covid-19 facility.A second hospital functionary said more logistical support would be required and for better care of Covid-19 patients.“We will need more PPE (personal protective equipment) kits and ventilators. Two separate ICUs will be formed for coronavirus positive and suspected patients, respectively. At present, we have a limited number of PPE kits. We are seeking more logistical support from the state government,” the official said.On Sunday, Union home minister Amit Shah held a meeting with lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and the three mayors of the north, east and south Delhi municipal corporations to assess the Covid-19 situation and chalk out a strategy to augment bed strength. Representatives of the three municipalities had offered to use their hospital infrastructure along with community centres and sports stadiums and complexes as Covid facilities. North corporation officials said infrastructure, equipment and other requirement as per protocols were in the process of being upgraded and procured. “Thermal scanners, PPE kits, N-95 masks and other safety equipment and ventilators, pulse oximeter among other tools are being procured. The hospital premises is being sanitised. A combined pool of doctors and other health care workers is being created for posting in different areas,” north corporation spokesperson Ira Singhal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hindu-rao-preps-up-will-need-a-day-or-two-to-start-functioning-as-covid-facility/story-B8ndxI5ljC5i0RR8gdUtPI.html
15-06-2020||Chandigarh||40% inmates released from Burail Jail during Covid-19 lockdown||Chandigarh About 40% of Chandigarh’s Burail Jail inmates were released on parole, including those under trial and convicted prisoners to decongest the prison during the Covid-19 lockdown period from March 26 to June 14, shows data from District Legal Service Authority (DLSA).

This is the fourth extension of the deadline; meanwhile, no school has been penalised for non-compliance.This was decided during the first meeting in two years of the fee regulatory body of Chandigarh held on Monday, director of school education Rubinderjit Singh Brar confirmed. The body also decided they will seek self-attested affidavits from hundreds of parents who had filed complaints with them before acknowledging their objections. As many as 51 private unaided schools of Chandigarh were issued show-cause notices for mass non-compliance of the Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institutions Act, 2016, on May 26. The schools were given seven working days to reply which were reviewed by the committee on Monday.As per the Act, which was notified in Chandigarh in 2018, if a school contravenes the provisions, it shall be punishable with a fine between Rs 60,000 to Rs 4 lakh depending on the number of violations and level of school (primary, middle, secondary).The Act also makes it mandatory for the fee regulatory body to scrutinise complaints within 15 days of receipt while ensuring the final decision is made within 60 days.Anamika Vohra, whose son studies in St Joseph School, Sector 44, said, “Over 200 people have signed the complaint submitted to the fee regulatory body.

Now they want an affidavit from over 270 parents?”“Schools have been given time till June 30 to upload their balance sheets. Either they will comply or send us a reply which will be verified by district education officer (DEO),” Brar said.When asked why no school was penalised, Brar said, “The committee was of the view that schools should be given more time. Also, the schools have challenged this provision in the Punjab and Haryana HC which will be heard on Tuesday.”Multiple complaints have also been filed by the parents with the fee regulatory body according to which schools were charging hiked consolidated fees instead of tuition fees of last academic session, in violation of the UT education department’s order.UT education secretary Arun Kumar Gupta refused to entertain any queries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-schools-given-fourth-deadline-extension-to-upload-their-balance-sheets-online/story-TNZqQOCmf85eesnQTFggrO.html

15-06-2020||Delhi||Private schools’ committee requests Delhi govt to release pending EWS reimbursement of 105 schools||A committee representing around 400 private schools in the national capital on Monday wrote to Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia requesting the release of pending reimbursements for the expenses they incurred for students enrolled with them under the economically weaker section (EWS) and disadvantaged groups (DG) categories.The committee said that the payment of as many as 105 private schools is pending for the academic year 2018-19 and 2019-20. The range of pending reimbursement varies between ₹8,00,000 and ₹35,00,000, the committee has estimated.The committee also stated that some of these schools have not received reimbursements since the academic session 2014-2015.According to the Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009, 25% of seats in entry-level classes —Nursery, KG and Class 1— are to be reserved for children from EWS/DG families. The Delhi RTE rules specify that students enrolled under the EWS/DG categories in private schools are entitled to free textbooks, writing material and uniforms, for which the government reimburses a fixed amount.In a letter addressed to Sisodia, the president of the action committee of unaided recognised private schools SK Bhattacharya wrote that several schools were going through a financial crisis amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “The fee collection has consistently diminished throughout the months of March, April, May and June 2020, leaving the schools struggling to honour their financial obligations. As a result of this, the school fee falls short of meeting the monthly outflow on salaries,” he wrote in the letter.HT had, on June 10, reported that nine of 10 parents did not pay their children’s fees in April in around 48% of 170 private schools in Delhi due to the economic slowdown triggered by the Covid-19 lockdown. The proportion worsened in May—to 64% of the schools.The committee said that many private schools built on government as well as private land have been waiting for the release of outstanding dues towards EWS/DG students. “The majority of the schools built on Delhi Development Authority (DDA) land are awaiting the release of outstanding dues towards EWS/DG students. The said dues are pending from the academic session 2014-2015 onwards”“Many schools on private land are also waiting for the EWS reimbursement for the sessions 2018-19 and 2019-20. That an immediate release of payments from the Directorate of Education (DoE) at this time will ease the burden for many schools, who would be unable to make salary payments for the month of May 2020,” the letter read.Binay Bhushan, the director of the DoE, said that the government has released the reimbursement amount for a majority of the private schools. “There could be a delay in the payment of last year’s reimbursement in case of some schools because all the deputy directors got busy with Covid-19 related work in March. We will look into this and direct the deputy directors to release the money at the earliest,” he said.A senior official from Sisodia’s office said, “Many schools do not submit the complete documents and bills on time and that’s why there is a backlog. The DoE always tries to release the funds on time. The government will look into the request received on Monday.”While the majority of the principals refused to comment on the matter, some said that they will not be able to pay salaries to their employees for the month of May. “We have not received even 10% of the students’ fee in April and May. If we get the pending reimbursement now it will help us pay the salaries of our employees,” said the principal of a private school in east Delhi on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/private-schools-committee-requests-delhi-govt-to-release-pending-ews-reimbursement-of-105-schools/story-haapYy3BkuUd5ACGZpBmFK.html

No fresh appointments under SRO 202. Probation period of old appointees reduced from 5 to 2 years. Massive step towards employee welfare,” J&K principal secretary Rohit Kansal tweeted.Union minister Dr Jitendra Singh also posted a tweet in this regard. “L-G Murmu just now called up to convey that as suggested to him, #SRO202 will not be indicated in new recruitment rules and for the existing appointees under SRO202, the probation period has been reduced to two years. Must compliment him for prompt response,” read Singh’s post.The BJP government had come under sharp criticism for continuing the discriminatory SRO 202, which was issued by the then chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed on June 30, 2015, during the PDP-BJP regime.Under the SRO, those getting government jobs had to be kept on probation for five years, with regularisation only after qualifying certain ability tests and trainings. Besides, the appointees were entitled to a minimum scale of pay.NC JAMMU CHIEF TERMS REVOCATION VICTORY OF STAKEHOLDERSNational Conference provincial president Devender Singh Rana on Monday described the revocation of SRO 202 as a triumph of those appointed under the provision in Jammu and Kashmir and those aspiring for employment in the government sector.“Better late than never, the course correction was the only rightful option for the administration as the SRO 202 lacked logic and reason,” Rana said in his reaction to the decision. He hoped that the administration would now release all the emoluments to the appointees under SRO 202 which would have accrued to them in accordance with the earlier rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sro-202-j-k-admn-scraps-controversial-ordinance-reduces-govt-employee-probation-to-2-years/story-IROdTMaIiWpiCmdJ3DOANP.html
15-06-2020||Mumbai||HC strikes down MSEDCL’s ₹2.22-crore supplementary bill to COEP||In a reprieve to the College of Engineering, Pune (CoEP), the Bombay high court (HC) on Friday upheld an order of the Electricity Ombudsman, Mumbai striking down supplementary demand of ₹2.22 crore from the leading government engineering college in Maharashtra.Justice Ujjal Bhuyan on Friday dismissed a petition filed by the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) challenging the Ombudsman order.In accordance with the tariff order passed in August 2012 order by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), MSEDCL changed the tariff category of CoEP hostel to HT-IX (non-express) on September 5, 2012.In 2015-16, CAG found mistakes in billing of certain category of MSEDCL consumers after which the electricity supplier carried out inspections and in March 2018 issued a supplementary bill to CoEP of about ₹2.22 crore claiming that the college’s hostel was wrongly categorised as a low tariff HT-IX consumer. MSEDCL also threatened to disconnect power supply to the 11 hostel buildings in case of failure to pay bill in due time.CoEP first moved the consumer forum and later the Electricity Ombudsman at Mumbai seeking to squash the supplementary bill. On April 2, 2019, the Ombudsman allowed plea of the college and struck down the supplementary demand notice.MSEDCL then moved the high court challenging the Ombudsman order on various grounds. HC noted that Section 56 (2) of the Electricity Act prohibits recovery of any sum from consumer after a period of two years from the date when such sum became first due, and therefore, it was not open to the electricity supplier to raise demands of differential bill for a period from February 2012 for the first time in March 2018.Besides, the judge said HT-IX tariff category was applicable to educational institutions and sports club, gymnasium, swimming pool, etc. attached to such institutions situated in the same premises and exclusively meant for the students. “If sports club, gymnasium, swimming pool, etc. attached to such institution and situated in the same premises exclusively meant for the students are covered by the said tariff category, there is no reason to exclude the hostel where the students reside from the ambit of the expression educational institution,” said justice Bhuyan. “Therefore, on this count also, raising of the supplementary bill is highly questionable,” the judge added.He said the Ombudsman correctly held that MSEDCL was not entitled to demand any differential bill for any period before February 2018, when tariff category of hostels was last changed. In this regard, the Ombudsman had relied on MERC order of February 2003 directing that there shall be no retrospective recovery of arrears on the basis of any abrupt re-classification of consumers, and that in such cases the billing should be prospective as those cannot be construed as cases of escaped billing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-strikes-down-msedcl-s-2-22-crore-supplementary-bill-to-coep/story-9ZrzkTC4K9qsdUr5bGmL6I.html

Now, only one militant remains active in Doda but the forces are after him. The region will soon become terror-free once again”.It may be stated here that following the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen “commander” Tahir Ahmad Bhat of Pulwama recently in Doda district, security forces have now upped the ante to catch longest surviving terrorist of Jammu and Kashmir — Jehangir Saroori alias Mohammad Amin Bhat of the same outfit.Saroori is the longest surviving militant in J&K and carries an award of nearly ₹50 lakh on his head that was announced by the police and National Investigating Agency.In October 2018, ₹30 lakh bounty was announced on Jehangir Saroori by the Jammu and Kashmir police for any information leading to his capture. The Kishtwar police had also put up ‘wanted dead or alive’ posters in the region for Saroori and his associates.The DGP added that in the past 16 to 17 days security forces eliminated 27 militants in Kashmir that included “commanders” of JeM, LeT, and Hizbul Mujahideen.He said that in recent months many militant commanders were eliminated in the valley.“While Pakistan proxies are being taken care of, it has not closed launch pads across the border. In fact, the first group of terrorists was pushed from the Keran sector on March 31 and they were eliminated within five days. Even now infiltration attempts are made, but our security forces are foiling them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/only-1-militant-active-in-doda-district-forces-committed-to-make-region-terror-free-again-j-k-dgp/story-Mn8tsfTqCgGlI8F4CxxWYK.html

The move has come after Baba Farid University of Health Science (BFUHS) announced exam dates for the BDS students.According to the students HT spoke to, at least three private dental colleges based in Patiala, Ferozepur and Faridkot have sought affidavits, while some have conveyed verbally to students to take responsibility if they contract the virus.A dental student, pleading anonymity, said, “The university has announced exam dates and colleges are refusing to take responsibility if we catch the infection.”Principal of Patiala-based Laxmi Bai Institute of Dental Science and Hospital Dr Ashutosh Nirula said, “We are doing everything according to guidelines of BFUHS. Though we are taking affidavits, but we will help students as we are in the medical profession. Besides, through affidavit we are trying to find out who is coming from red zone and containment zone.”Dental Student Association Punjab (DSAP) has already submitted a memorandum to Punjab government seeking postponement of BDS exams till normalcy prevails.BFUHS vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur said, “We know how to conduct exam. Nobody will be get infected while appearing in the exam as we will follow all the norms. Besides, I am not responsible for what private colleges are asking students to do. None of the government colleges has asked students to sign any such affidavit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-pvt-dental-colleges-refuse-to-take-onus-for-students-safety-during-exams/story-hE9sIZ6ZyRFpQkl1EdENiL.html
15-06-2020||Chandigarh||As residents protest, more pockets of Bapu Dham Colony in Chandigarh likely to come out of buffer zone||Hours after residents protested at the containment zone in Bapu Dham Colony, Sector 26, the Chandigarh administration called the meeting of the area affected committee, which is learnt to have decided to remove strict perimeter control from nearly 60% of the areas that are currently under buffer zone.The colony has the city’s only containment zone in its pocket number 15. In addition to it, seven other of the 20 pockets are under buffer zone. Around 12,000 people live in these eight pockets.“The perimeter restrictions are likely to be removed from four of the seven pockets in buffer zone, where no Covid-19 case has been reported. In the AAC meeting, discussions were also held whether restrictions can be removed from other pockets in buffer zone by isolating house blocks where cases have been reported,” said a senior UT official, who attended the meeting.Pocket number 15, where protests took place on Monday, is likely to continue as a containment zone, added the official, requesting anonymity. “The final decision will be taken by the UT administrator, likely during Tuesday’s daily review meeting,” the official said. TEMPERS SPILL ONTO STREETSHaving stayed under strict restrictions for more than a month and a half, residents of Pocket No. 15 came out on the lanes on Monday morning, raising slogans against the administration. They threw garbage in front of their houses and also removed some barricades erected to restrict their movement. “The desperation levels in the containment zone are rising. People are traumatised. Many have lost their jobs and are facing severe financial crunch,” said a resident, who didn’t want to be named.Residents complained that except for dry ration of flour and pulses, there has been no support from the administration. “We have been caged here, even when no positive case has been reported for more than two weeks. The administration hasn’t come forward to help us, especially financially. We still have to purchase vegetables, milk and other items of daily needs from our pocket. As most of the people are from low-income groups, it is becoming difficult to manage the expenses,” said Varinder, a resident.The residents ended their protest only after police assured them their demands will be looked into immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/as-residents-protest-more-pockets-of-bapu-dham-colony-in-chandigarh-likely-to-come-out-of-buffer-zone/story-LSohocZ7rBV3Rbatr1q4mL.html
15-06-2020||Chandigarh||Finally, ISBT Mohali back in business as Punjab, Pepsu start services||Mohali: A dream project of the former Shiromani Akali Dal government, the state-or-the-art Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Inter State Bus Terminus (ISBT Mohali) lying almost abandoned after power changed hands in Punjab, is finally back in business.The development follows the Chandigarh administration’s decision to suspend interstate operations of Chandigarh Transport Union and other state operated buses from the city’s Sector 43 from June 13 to June 30, following a spike in Covid-19 cases.All Punjab and Pepsu Roadways buses are now operating from ISBT Mohali, which was inaugurated on December 17, 2016, by then the Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal. Only one terminal of the bus stand was made operational then, and after SAD lost the elections the ruling Congress termed it a ‘white elephant’ before abandoning it.The company which built and operated the ISBT also went bankrupt and fled.Halts only at bus stands“The buses will run only within the boundaries of Punjab and Chandigarh, with halts at bus stands and not at stops falling on the way,” said Bhupinder Singh, director, transport, Punjab.“If the bus is running from Mohali to Amritsar, it will halt only at the Jalandhar bus stand, not at the bus stops in Balachaur and Phagwara,” he added.Passengers will have to buy tickets from counters while maintaining social distancing and masks are mandatory.Not more than 25 passengers will be allowed in a bus with a total capacity of 52 seats. Two passengers will be accommodated on three seats, with the middle seat kept vacant, while one passenger will occupy the adjacent row with two seats.Bhupinder Singh said the seats not to be occupied will be marked with a cross, adding that there was no notification regarding operation of private buses.Project that went off-trackThe ambitious Busopolis project was launched in 2009 and was to be completed in December 2011. Spread over seven acres, it was to have an inter-state bus terminal, three multi-storey towers with retail and office spaces, multiplex, five-star hotel, banquet hall, hyper markets, and a helipad atop a tower. But since its inception, the project has been mired in controversies and possession delays. While the bus terminal has become operational, the commercial towers are yet to be completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/finally-isbt-mohali-back-in-business-as-punjab-pepsu-start-services/story-KYTgskHJhP0YjnFSg7WoBI.html
15-06-2020||Music||K-Pop goes solo to follow social distancing: No group rule leaves some happy, some sad||The craze of K-Pop among youngsters can only be seen to be believed! Those who have attended the previous years’ contest would know about the huge fan following it commands. But, though last year 75 countries participated in the world K-Pop contest, this year it will be different since the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted this genre of Korean pop music and dance, as well. Among the few counties that are enrolling for the festival this year, India is one. And the fans here are kicked to be part of the gala yet again. To them, what has come as a surprise is the fact that only solo entries will be allowed this year. “The enthusiasm and vibrant energy of K-Pop fans in India drove us to pursue the contest even in this time of pandemic... The festival has changed its rules and ways due to the coronavirus scare,” says Kim Kum-Pyoung, director, Korean Cultural Centre India, informing, “Participants cannot participate as a group but only perform solo to avoid any kind of gatherings and chances of infection. And it is for the very first time that we will be hosting the regional round on an online platform. We have made this decision owing to the current, exceptional and extreme situation that people are facing. We believe that well-being of the community is much more important to flourish and explore one’s potential.”   The news has excited some fans and aspiring finalists. Jasmine Kaur, a school student from Delhi’s Ramesh Nagar, and a diehard fan of K-Pop boy band BTS, says, “I love K-pop! The best part about their songs is the lyrics. I have recently recorded a song for the competition, and the good thing was I didn’t feel any (stage) fear. Otherwise I used to feel so under confident while performing on the stage; but when I recorded my participating video while in the comfort of my living room, I was like wow, this is so easy! So, I recorded Whistle, a song by girl group Blackpink. Wish me luck so that I get through to the finale!” Another Delhi-based participant, Aranya, 17, who lives in Kalkaji, emphasises on the importance of getting a first hand experience of stage performances. She says, “For an artist, stage appearance counts and it’s one of my strongest points. I will be missing that since recording at home is no fun; it’s like practising since the vibes are very casual.”There are some youngsters who are not happy about this new decision, which is lowering their chances of a win. Pooja Mishra, a fan of the popular boy band EXO, is a participant from Mumbai this year, who was supposed to perform in a group initially. She shares, “I felt this is a missed opportunity for me... We were presenting our best in the group, but now with the rule of only solo performances, our chances of presenting something extraordinary have reduced drastically. I will still try to perform in the best possible way.” The ‘single entry only’ rule has acted as a boon for a few others like Harshita Goyal, a college student from Noida. A fan of K-Pop girl group, Twice, Goyal adds, “I’m one of the biggest fans of K-Pop, and have been trying their dance style for a while now. I thought I can’t participate because I’m not associated with any group or fan club, and performing solo while others are in group also reduces your chances. But this time, there are only solo entries and I’m super excited! I’m preparing my dance performances on bhangra beats and will submit my entry soon. I just hope ki regional round mein toh select ho jaun.” Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/music/k-pop-goes-solo-to-follow-social-distancing-no-group-rule-leaves-some-happy-some-sad/story-YdepfDL2XqZFmLcyK1wXaO.html

At the time of the incident, the woman was alone at home.On being informed, the police reached the spot and initiated investigation. The victim has been rushed to a hospital, where her condition was stable.The victim, Rashmeet Kaur, 31, is wife of Amarjit Singh, who owns a machine tool factory in Millar Ganj.

After Rashmeet fell unconscious, the women robbed cash and gold after breaking open locks of the almirah,” the police said.Gurmeet Singh, brother-in-law of Rashmeet, said, “Rashmeet had made a call to her sister in Hoshiarpur minutes before the incident. After she gathered some consciousness, she redialled her number.”“Rashmeet was only murmuring over phone which was not audible to her sister. After repeated calls, when her sister could not talk to Rashmeet, she made a call to their relatives in the same locality and asked them to go to their house. When relatives rushed to the house, they were shocked to see Rashmeet lying unconscious on the floor and the house was ransacked. Then they informed the police,” said Gurmeet Singh.He added women had robbed Rs 8 lakh in cash and 300gm gold jewellery from the house.The SHO added the police have scanned CCTVs installed in the area.

15-06-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 effect: Cycling now trending among Chandigarh fitness enthusiasts||Chandigarh For the last two years Shubham Karkra, 18, was regularly pumping iron till gymnasiums across the country closed down because of the Covid-19 lockdown. So when restrictions were lifted but gyms were not allowed to open by the UT administration, Karkra switched over to cycling. For the past one month, his daily fitness schedule includes two hours of cycling. “Unable to go to the gym in the current scenario, I find cycling the best alternative, followed by some exercises for biceps,” says this Class 12 student who lives in Sector 51.Like Shubham, a number of fitness enthusiasts across the tricity have found a new love in cycling during the Covid-19 period. Among them is Umrao Singh, 27, who had once formed a motorbike club, Thunders, with his college friends dedicated to their love for the Enfield Bullet Thunderbird. Members, who over the years got stuck in the career race and forgot about the club, are now back – but the motorbikes have been replaced by bicycles. Ideal for long ridesSince the last month, weekends are reserved for long cycling trips. “We have started organising road trips after quite some time, but now we’re on bicycles. Now, every Sunday around eight to 10 of our friends take off on a long trip. This Sunday we went to Timber Trail, cycling for around 100km,” says Umrao, an engineer and resident of Sector 46. “Apart from getting us back together, cycling helps us remain fit and it’s fun too,” he adds Sukhpreet Kaur, 28, an engineer working with Infosys has also discovered a new passion in cycling. “I started last month. Earlier my fitness routine revolved around the gym, but now it’s one hour of cycling in the morning and at times I go for a walk,” says this resident of Sector 22. “Either I cycle around my sector or go to Sukhna lake.”Cycling has always been associated with the city designed by French architect Le Corbusier and because of its cycling track, Chandigarh stands out among Indian cities, often drawing comparison to other European cities, where cycles are a popular mode of transport. The city’s iconic Sukhna Lake too is now turning into a ‘cyclist’s paradise’. “It’s been decades since I worked out, but last month when the lockdown was lifted, I thought of buying a cycle and initially got one without a gear. However, it was difficult to pedal on long routes, so, after 10 days, I bought another one with gears. Now my daily circuit is around 50 to 60 km and the lake is a part of my daily cycling route,” says 54-year-old advocate Vikas Cuccria, a resident of Sector 39.Sales increase The sale of bicycles has increased to four to five folds in the last one month. “Earlier before the lockdown we used to sell around two cycles a day, now we are touching eight. A lot of machines are coming in for repairs as people who were not using them are now cycling regularly,” says Manjeet Singh, store manager of Firefox Cycles in Sector 22.“We have over 200 active runners in our running group Chandigarh Runners and in the last one month, over 50 of our members have included cycling in their fitness regimen. These days they are spending more time cycling than running,” says fitness freak Jaspreet Kaur, a mother of two, who runs and cycles to stay fit and healthy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-effect-cycling-now-trending-among-chandigarh-fitness-enthusiasts/story-CiqOvms43Sk7TrTl6VBfqN.html

The application was moved after the ADJ’s court granted interim bail to Saini in anticipation of SIT adding Section 302 of the IPC to the earlier FIR.Multani was allegedly picked up by two officers in 1991 after a terrorist attack on Saini, the then Chandigarh SSP, in which four policemen in his security posse were killed. The police later claimed that Multani had escaped from the custody of Qadian police.A case was registered under Sections 364 (kidnapping or abduction in order to murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 344 (wrongful confinement), 330 (voluntarily causing hurt to exhort confession) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) in Mohali on May 6 on the basis of a complaint filed by Multani’s brother Palwinder.Former DSP Baldev Singh Saini, inspector Satvir Singh, sub-inspectors Har Sahai Sharma, Jagir Singh and Anoop Singh and ASI Kuldip Singh were also named in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/abduction-case-against-ex-dgp-saini-hearing-on-plea-seeking-transfer-of-case-deferred-till-june-23/story-BSoGu1SHjA5kAoxYlOVZDN.html

It said that a “a five-member committee will conduct the detailed audit of the official record pertaining to the cash assistance, ration, inclusion/deletion, bifurcation, cashbook, cash A/c, etc. and will submit a detailed report”.“We totally reject this committee. How can justice be expected from those people who were very much part of the scam? It seems that the committee has been made to cover up the scam. It also is very clear that the government is not sincere to give justice to the wronged,” the body said.“Ethically, what should have been spent on the relief and rehabilitation of the persecuted has been mischievously and deliberately given to the undeserving,” said Mahaldar.While giving details of the press briefing they had addressed on May 17, Mahaldar said the Jammu and Kashmir administration is annually dispersing an amount of approximately ₹78 crore to political workers in Kashmir.“Documents with us show that the administration has been paying the National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party and the Congress workers for the past 30 years. These leaders and workers have been getting the money from J&K coffers every month and every year since 1990. The amount totals a whopping ₹2,340 crore for the last 30 years,” he said.“We lost our houses and land because of terrorism and persecution and now the relief meant for us is also being cornered by many people in Kashmir. This is an irony,” Mahaldar said.“We reiterate our demand for an independent inquiry either by CBI or ACB. The amount involved in the scam is huge and the people involved need to be punished.” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kashmir-pandit-migrants-body-rejects-relief-funds-scam-probe-panel/story-mQMygCh4mYM3zHpWPbptGM.html

He was under extreme distress as he was not earning much and had to borrow money to meet household expenses, his younger brother said. Investigating officer, assistant sub-inspector Hira Singh said inquest proceedings were initiated under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on the basis of the family members’ statements. The body has been handed over to the family, he added.Reacting to the incident, autorickshaw union general secretary Rakesh Sharma said most autorickshaw drivers in the city were pushed to the edge due to lack of customers. “There are around 5,000 CNG-run autos and over 25,000 registered autos in the city, but only a few are on the road these days. We are struggling to find passengers as most people prefer to stay home due to fear of infection.” said Sharma, demanding relief from the state government.

15-06-2020||City||J&K’s new media policy draws sharp criticism from Kashmir journalists||Jammu and Kashmir’s new media policy has evoked sharp criticism from journalists in the valley, politicians and the civil society.Many have called it an attempt to kill the independence of journalists and media outlets operating the region, especially Kashmir.Earlier this month, the J&K administration approved the new Media Policy-2020 stating that it was meant for effective communication and public outreach.The administration also stated that the policy attempts to “thwart misinformation, fake news and tries to develop a mechanism that will raise alarm against any attempt to use the media to vitiate public peace, sovereignty and integrity of the country”.The policy allows the directorate of information and public relations (DIPR) to “examine the content of the media for any fake news, plagiarism and unethical and anti-national activities” and any individual or group indulging in such things “shall be de-empanelled besides being proceeded against under the law, the administration said.Veteran journalist and former north India correspondent of BBC, Altaf Hussain said it is an attempt to browbeat the media so that they are not able to report facts.“This is to kill the independence of media. There have been such attempts in the past as well. In these past 30 years, there would be so many occasions where we would annoy either the government or the militants and many of our colleagues lost their lives for it. We have resisted such pressures and guarded our own freedom. Now, it’s the time to show the same resolve to uphold truth,” Hussain, who has also edited a vernacular newspaper, said.“We don’t have to come out on the streets, but simply have to report honestly. These are challenging times for they want us to go the way of lapdog media,” he said.While most newspaper owners refused to comment or write on the new media policy fearing reprisals from the government, some termed it as a coercive measure to silence the media voices.Asem Mohiudin, founder and editor of weekly The Legitimate, said J&K’s media industry is under tremendous constraints and instead of bailing it out, more coercive laws are being enforced.“Since 2006, it is the third time that the UT has changed its media policy. Ironically, all the times no responsible media entrepreneur or journalist is consulted for the framing of the policy. But later on the policy is never fully implemented hence it violates its own rules and laws… Now it has come up with another modified version. That only violates the ethics of professional journalism.”Haroon Rashid, editor of a prominent Urdu daily published from Srinagar, said from the past three decades, journalists working in Kashmir have been facing suffocation. “This policy is not only dangerous but also one-sided, and nobody from the local media was taken into confidence during its framing.”Kashmir Press Club general secretary Ishfaq Tantray said the club members had an online meeting and a need was felt that all media organisations should come together for a joint mechanism to deal with the issue. “I see this media policy is a serious threat to press freedom in J&K and everybody needs to come forward and devise a joint response.”Safwat Zarger, who writes for Scroll, said nobody is against the idea of coming down on fake news or other unethical journalistic conduct, but this policy effectively leaves the judgment in the hands of bureaucrats, which is dangerous. “Such a policy is detrimental to the freedom of speech and expression and has no place in democratic framework.”Former chief minister and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah was also critical of the policy. “The only version the authorities want heard is their own. The truth will be the biggest casualty of this Orwellian order,” Abdullah said while tweeting an editorial of a national daily against the new policy.PDP spokesperson Suhail Bukhari, who is also a former journalist, said the new policy introduced by J&K government is an assault on the freedom of press and demanded its roll back. “By bringing the new media policy, the administration has begun yet another element of its agenda it embarked on August 5 by disempowering the people of J&K.”A Congress spokesperson also criticised it saying, “Nobody is happy with new media policy.”Communist Party of India CPI (M) leader Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami said the new policy has spread unease amongst journalists working in the region. “Those who framed this policy have given a clear picture that they don’t want journalists answerable to their readers and editors, but to bureaucrats and security officials.”However the BJP has welcomed the policy. “Journalists also should be made accountable. Many people write only negative things about the government and never highlight the positive developments, so that was necessary,” said BJP state spokesperson Altaf Thakur.Calls to commissioner secretary information Rohit Kansal and information director Sehrish Asgar did not yield any response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-admn-s-new-media-policy-an-affront-to-press-freedom-say-kashmiri-journalists/story-onv0pfBkgHcBnUH6ZoQl2O.html

He asked the Gurukul principal that besides the online mode, if need be, study material should be despatched to the students at their residences.Underscoring the need for optimally enhancing the prospects of suitable placements of the passing-out students of the nursing college, Kumar asked the principal to tie-up with various leading healthcare institutions in the country for arranging placements for the students as the first batch of the BSc Nursing students of SMVDCoN is passing-out this year. While reviewing the initiatives being taken for enhancing employability of the Gurukul students, the CEO emphasised the need to guide the students about various career options and available opportunities. In this context, he asked the principal to contact various organisations for exploring possibilities of job placements for the passing-out students.In furtherance of this objective, the CEO stressed for imparting practical training and required skills to the students in Vedic mantras, Karam Kand, Jyotish, Vastu Shastra and other religious ceremonies and rituals so that they avail adequate job opportunities after passing-out from the institution. The first batch of the Shastri Part-III is passing-out from the Gurukul this year.Among those who participated in the meeting included Hem Kant Prasher, chief accounts officer of the shrine board; Dr Sunil Sharma, deputy CEO of the shrine board and administrator of SMVDCoN and SMVD Gurukul; Dr Shailla Cannie, principal of SMVDCoN and D.

15-06-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan offers Covid-19 testing facility to Delhi, neighbouring states||With Covid-19 cases increasing in neighbouring states, the Rajasthan government has offered testing facilities of up to 5,000 samples daily to neighbouring states.“In times of this crisis, neighbouring states which are overloaded with patients and short of testing facilities can get tests done in Rajasthan,” Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said at a meeting to review the pandemic situation in the state.Gehlot said States such as Delhi, Haryana, Gujarat, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh could get tests for their patients done in Rajasthan.Also read: Amid surge in Covid-19 cases in India, recoveries rise to 51%Rajasthan is among the states carrying out the highest number of testing.Gehlot also announced that by July end all government hospitals will have oxygen supply through pipelines instead of cylinders.The chief minister said Rajasthan had started from zero testing capacity which is now around 25,000 tests per day. He also said that the recovery rate has improved dramatically to touch 75% due to the constant monitoring and screening of patients.Kalicharan Saraf, who was health minister in the previous BJP government, said the government was making false claims to win brownie points.“The government claims that they are doing 25,000 tests daily and will soon increase it to 40,000. But according to media reports, the government is only carrying out 11,000 tests per day. So they are misguiding people,” said Saraf.Also read: Increase Covid-19 testing capacity, Delhi govt orders labs“If the government has testing facilities then why don’t they use it for people of Rajasthan first before trying to win cheap popularity by offering it to other states,” he said.He said if 25,000 tests were actually being carried out, Rajasthan would have been able to control coronavirus till now.Jitendra Chaudhary, head of the lab technicians association at SMS hospital, said using the CB-NAAT machines and pooled testing technique has helped to ramp up testing capacity in the state. There are 72 CB-NAAT machines being used for Covid testing. ICMR approved these diagnostic machines which are used for testing TB to be used for COVID testing.Dr Virendra Singh, a member of the CM’s advisory committee on Covid-19 said that Rajasthan has more capacity to test than the samples received and so for a limited time period, testing facility can be extended to other statesHe said while the testing capacity is adequate, the government should try to shorten the time lag in testing and providing the report to patients. “Reports should be available to patients within 6-8 hours instead of 2-3 days.”While the state is increasing testing capacity across districts, it is declining in Jaipur because there is pressure of testing from other neighbouring districts in the Covid-19 testing centres. Of the total samples, 34% are those from other districts such as Tonk, Dausa, Karauli, Alwar and Bharatpur.Till now, some 1.3 lakh Covid-19 samples have been tested in five centres in Jaipur. Of these, 89,000 tests were of Jaipur and the rest were from other districts.Since the number of samples of other districts is more than those from Jaipur, the samples from Jaipur are often put on hold for 2-3 days which delays the test results.Jaipur has been overtaken by Jodhpur in the number of tests. Jodhpur which has three Covid-19 testing centres is testing more samples than Jaipur. So far, 1.7 lakh samples have been tested in Jodhpur.Currently testing is being carried out in 16 districts in the state though the chief minister and health minister have said that testing facilities will soon be developed in all 33 districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-offers-covid-19-testing-facility-to-delhi-neighbouring-states/story-CCG0nsdhSpSzUfnoytwiUN.html

15-06-2020||City||Asked to get smartphones for survey, ASHA workers in Ludhiana stage protest||Struggling to arrange ‘latest smartphones’ for the health department’s recently launched door-to-door survey, ASHA workers in Ludhiana staged a protest outside the civil surgeon’s office and raised slogans against health authorities on Monday. Leading the protest, All India ASHA Worker and Facilitators Union’s state unit president Jeet Kaur said, “A majority of ASHA workers don’t own a smart phone. Moreover, we are being asked to collect details such as name, parents names, mobile number, gender, age, occupation and ailments of all persons aged above 30. This seems to be an infringement of privacy.” She added that ASHA workers will be given merely Rs 4 to fill one form, which is three-pages long.The union’s district president, Balbir Kaur said it was the sixth survey in three months. “Earlier, we had conducted a verbal survey for generating awareness about the spread of Covid-19. Thereafter, we did a survey to check if there were any positive patients in the localities. Then we went to gather details on Tablighi Jamaat followers, devotees who returned from Holla Mohalla and recently returned NRIs,” said Kaur.Demanding to make the survey a paper-based one, a delegation of ASHA workers handed over a memorandum to the deputy commissioner’s office later in the day. They also demanded that some private details should be eliminated so as to maintain patients’ privacy.Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Baggar said that staging a protest was not a solution. “Instead of discussing their concern, the workers began raising slogans,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/asked-to-get-smartphones-for-survey-asha-workers-in-ludhiana-stage-protest/story-9g42Kmu9NavEPK9zbzdA7L.html
15-06-2020||Pune||Recovery rate among children highest among all age groups in city: PMC data||The Covid-19 recovery rate of children - between 0 and10 years - is the highest among all age groups as per the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) health department data. Of the 9,082 positive cases reported in the city till June 12, 577 are within the age group of 0-10 and only two deaths have been recorded so far. A 13-month-old girl from Warje died on May 10 and a two-month-old infant was declared dead on June 7, but reported on Saturday. As per PMC data, the death rate among children is the lowest, however, doctors state that even though they are less likely to be severely affected by the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection, they are potential carriers and all precautions must be taken to remain uninfected.Of the 575 Covid-19 infected children (0-10 years of age), 388 - 205 males and 183 females- have been discharged. The remaining 187 -102 males and 85 females- are currently admitted at various hospitals across the city. Of the two deaths, the 13-month-old girl had been admitted to the Sassoon General Hospital on May 4 while the two-month-old baby boy had been admitted to KEM on June 3 and was suffering from anterior mediastinal hemangioma compressing trachea, apart from being Covid-19 positive. Dr Ramchandra Hankare, PMC health chief, said, “The common ailments seen in kids are malnutrition, anaemia, heart disease, congeniality anomaly, leukaemia, diarrhoea, measles, TB and blood cancer. Although they have a high recovery rate, they are still considered as high risk groups and the treatment is done accordingly.”“The need to segregate them from other patients is because the treatment or the drug dose is as per the weight. It is true that the mortality rate is low amongst children, however, they are still considered to be high risk groups like the senior citizens,” said Dr Hankare. The state government directives also clearly states that any person above the age of 65 and below 10 should avoid going out even as restrictions are being relaxed after the lockdown. Dr Tushar Parikh, consultant, paediatrics and neonatology, Motherhood Hospital, says, “There are multiple reasons why kids are less likely to be severely infected due to Covid-19. Even though children have a weaker immune system than adults, the latter are more likely to have other comorbid conditions and so the immunity is compromised. Secondly, children have been recently vaccinated with the BCG vaccine and this particular vaccine has proven to be helpful in some cases across the globe. Thirdly, since the receptors in kids’ organ cells are ‘less expressed’, so the virus cannot enter the cells and therefore, the damage is not so severe. The viral load is less and the virus does not multiply as much as it multiples in adults. These are just hypothesis and nothing has been proven, but it is helpful to ensure that there is no need to panic among the public.”Dr Parikh adds that although parents should not panic, they must take care of their kids as much as adults. “The Centre for Disease Control in America has stated that multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a condition where different body parts can become inflaed and there is no known proof of what causes MIS-C. However, we know that many children with MIS-C had the virus that causes COVID-19, or had been around someone with Covid-19. It is also known MIS-C can be fatal, but most of the children recover with good healthcare.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/recovery-rate-among-children-highest-among-all-age-groups-in-city-pmc-data/story-hrCowUvtnVCCxoBVaWLrpK.html

We must ensure that work is not hampered because they are at home,” the official said.The West Bengal government had last week said only asymptomatic employees shall be allowed to attend office on rotation basis.“Anyone with symptoms of mild fever, cough and cold need not attend office, and officers and staff residing in the containment zones shall not come to office. He/she will work from home till the area is declared as a Clear Area (category C)...,” it had said, issuing a set of guidelines.The state government has also discouraged face-to-face meetings and said officers should communicate via intercom, mobile phone and video-conferencing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/west-bengal-govt-introduces-software-to-keep-track-of-employees-working-from-home-amid-covid-19/story-TRRfnFbMrjdaXZELv7FJoM.html
15-06-2020||Pune||Fish prices see 80% hike as supply chains dwindle; mutton, chicken remain ‘costly’||The retail cost of fish has spiked in the city as supply chains are not able to meet the demand, according to traders.The retail cost of chicken has remained high, as HT reported in May – the broiler price is still Rs 240 per kg, up from the pre-Covid rate of Rs 140 per kg in February; and up from the initial negative Covid impact of Rs 70kg in March.The retail cost of mutton has also remained at the Covid-spiked rate of Rs 700-Rs750 per kg, up from the pre-Covid rate of Rs 620 per kg.Now, fish eaters will feel the bite as well.FishFish retailer Thakur Pardesh, who owns two shops - one at Kothrud and another at Ganesh peth - said, “There is a sharp rise in fish costs due to less supply. Good quality pomfret no costs between Rs 1,700 to Rs 2,000 per kg. This is an 80 per cent hike in prices as compared to last month. It is the same for surmai (seer fish) and ravas (Indian salmon). Besides prawns and bombil (Bombay Duck), prices of all fish are high.”Surmai which retailed for a pre-Covid rate of Rs 500/kg is now Rs 900/kg.Pardesh explains: “The main reason is the supply. Fisheries along the west coast have all almost come to a standstill. We are hoping that the fisheries on the East coast, from Howrah, in West Bengal, start normal supply. The demand for fish is high in the city.”MuttonVitthal Thorpe, who owns the Ahilya Devi mutton shop at the KK market in Bibwewadi, said, “Before lockdown, mutton was Rs620 per kg. For the last two months prices are Rs 700-Rs750 per kg. Every shop has different rates considering the less availability of goats. As the livestock markets are not operational in rural areas, mutton shop owners procure goats directly from farmers. Travel costs increased, so it is natural for mutton prices to remain high. Demand for mutton is good.”Vijay Kamble, president, Kolhapuri mutton sellers’ association said, “We are not getting goats and transport costs have increased. The Kolhapur Collector gave us a price cap of Rs580 per kg, but as costs have increased we are selling mutton at Rs620 per kg in Kolhapur.”Chicken“Chicken prices are high as there is not enough supply from poultry farms. Wholesale prices are high. Chicken broilers are selling for between Rs220 to Rs240 per kg, and last week, reached Rs280 per kg,” said chicken retailer Amin Shaikh.Venky’s general manager P G Pedgaonkar said, “The poultry industry has seen many ups and downs during Covid-19. Demand for chicken increased now. We have seen the lowest, as well as the highest prices in the last few months. Till the supply chain normalises, rates will remain on the higher side.”Poultry federation of India’s president Ramesh Khatri said, “Prices of chicken are high everywhere. Once the hotels and restaurants start functioning, the demand for chicken will increase. The industry is hoping that within the next two months supply and demand get stable.”Customer speakGanesh Zende, a non-vegetarian consumer who lives on Satara road with a family of six, said, “The rates of chicken, mutton and fish all of are high, but the price of fish is now beyond a limit. I prefer to eat chicken and sometimes mutton.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fish-prices-see-80pc-hike-as-supply-chains-dwindle-mutton-chicken-remain-costly/story-u0OtPpXLUOhXh5I5pz8fjJ.html
15-06-2020||Hindustan||Breaking the logjam on the northern border||A clearly defined, accurately depicted and accepted boundary is essential for exercising sovereignty within the nation state, and the process starts with mutually accepted broad contours of where the boundary should lie followed by a political agreement to refine and define it. The boundary is then subjected to delineation, which essentially implies drawing on the map where the boundary runs, and finally demarcation by identifying and marking on the ground with natural features and boundary pillars.Where such an exercise is not considered critical, politically or economically, and both nation states find it expedient to let the ground reality prevail, the concept of frontiers emerges wherein both states exercise control up to a general line, leaving an opaque zone or buffer ensuring avoidance of confrontation or conflict.Finally, boundaries can be defined by natural features such as rivers, watersheds and prominent landmarks or artificially by latitude and longitude reference.Colonial Britain addressed boundaries and frontiers from the perspective of imperial interests and not securing lasting sovereignty for a unified India. Consequently, except where a direct threat from a neighbouring power suggested demarcation so as to draw the inviolable line, the British were content to declare major stretches as frontiers. While the McMahon Line came near to defining the generally accepted alignment of the Indo-Tibetan boundary in the eastern sector, the western sector remained the major bone of contention.INHERITED BRITISH LEGACYPost the First Anglo-Sikh War and under Article 4 of the Treaty of Lahore on March 9, 1846, the Lahore Durbar ceded all territories between the Beas and Indus rivers to the British and Article 12 in turn rewarded Gulab Singh with ‘independent sovereignty’ of these territories. The Karakoram in the north and its extension south-east was the extent of the Sikh Empire when these treaties were concluded.William Johnson, an official of the Survey of India, while at Leh en route to Khotan in 1865, came up with the advanced boundary line of the Kashmir state without any serious physical survey. This extended the ceded territories of the Sikh Empire eastwards to the Kun-Lun watershed, encompassing Aksai Chin. It found expression in the Survey of India map of 1868.In 1893, Hung-Ta Chen, the Chinese official at Kashgar, handed a map showing the proposed boundary to George McCartney, the British consul-general at Kashgar. This showed the border along the Karakoram mountains, which was a natural boundary up to the Indus river watershed. The British presented this line, known as the Macartney-MacDonald Line, to the Chinese in 1899 through Sir Claude MacDonald, the British representative at Peking. The Chinese did not respond and it was taken as accepted. The boundary had more or less reverted to the extent of the ceded territories of 1846. In 1962, the People’s Liberation Army advanced up to the 1899 MacDonald Line and is generally now the Chinese claim line as was also articulated in 1959.Based on imperial British cartographic declarations of shifting boundaries in the western sector, India inherited and chose to persist with the whole of Aksai Chin being part of erstwhile Kashmir state integrated into India. While the analysis, views and theories doing the rounds of academic circles and seminars may suggest the long term strategic purpose of Chinese actions and the threat to India, the fundamental objective is to bring around an agreement on the contours of the boundary, of course as perceived by the Chinese, so as to set the path for delineation and demarcation.EXPANSIONIST POWERDiplomacy by its very nature is designed for sugar-coated compromise. It is no substitute for, and is inversely proportional to, hard national power. Under the Sino-Indian Border Peace and Tranquillity Agreement (BPTA), 1993, the two sides agreed to call the entire disputed border as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which in fact became a frontier; liable to alteration by force and with the hope of delineation. After 22 rounds of talks by special representatives, nothing appears to have been reconciled. Chinese incursions have been generally glossed over and presented as a peaceful diplomatic solution.China today is an expansionist power with historical grievances, much like Germany in the 1930s, blatantly disregarding treaties and conventions. Such powers have always been balanced by coalition of alliances or building corresponding power to resist and address the asymmetry. Our neglect, unwillingness and incapacity to invest in creating such corresponding power, and our ideologically and morally driven non-alignment precluding alliances fore-closes these options. With both avenues closed to address this expansionism, the future holds humiliation behind the façade of diplomacy.COURSE AND CONSEQUENCESIrrespective of the political dispensation in power, our national security issues are a matter of exaggeration and magnification of minor tactical actions by the ruling party and any setback, actual or perceived, is painted as a sell out by the opposition leaving no scope or ground for serious and pragmatic debate for resolution with national interest in focus. Then there is the Indian Parliament 1962 resolution to recover every inch of Indian territory from China making any seriously negotiated settlement nearly impossible.For six decades, we have wished away the reality. Emotional hyper nationalism is no substitute for comprehensive national power and sober handling of national security issues. What then is the solution to this logjam? Do we have the will and wherewithal to force the issue? Can we shed the ideological baggage or impractical resolutions? If not, then perhaps a practical and honourable accommodation with China remains a pragmatic option. Zhou Enlai’s proposal of 1960 and Deng Xiaoping’s of 1982 need serious consideration free from and above bindings.The nation and the political leadership are free to choose what course to follow but would not be free from the consequences of the choice.lgnsbrar@gmail.comThe writer is a former chief of staff at Leh-based 14 Corps and deputy chief, integrated defence staff.

The first Covid-19 case was reported in the district on March 21 after a UK-returned man tested positive for the deadly infection. The district, which falls under the red-zone, took 58 days (till May 18) to report 305 cases, of which 263 patients had returned from Takht Hazur Sahib in Nanded, Maharashtra. However, soon after relaxations were imposed community transmission (where a patient has no travel history and has not come in direct contact of any infected person) commenced and Covid-19 cases doubled from 305 to 613 in 27 days (till June 14).Of the 613 Covid-19 patients in the district, 418 have recovered and 21 have succumbed to the disease.17 DEATHS IN 27 DAYS While Covid-19 cases are rising in the district, there has been a corresponding decrease in recovery rate.

The central defender had played a key role in their runners-up finish in 2018-19. He played two seasons with them. One month into the COVID-19 lockdown, Quess Corp applied the Force Maejeure clause to terminate players’ contracts and purportedly sent eviction notice to some of them in May. “I close a cycle of my life, this time a little different. In a great institution to which I have a lot of love and respect, Quess East Bengal FC, but that in the end there were contract and salary issues that failed to comply,” Acosta wrote on his Instagram page.  I close a cycle of my life, this time a little different.

The request comes against the backdrop of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) offering to pay the same amount to its intern doctors serving Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients in various hospitals. The letter states, ‘Pune has the second highest number of Covid-19 cases all over Maharashtra. The hospital is not only handling the load of Pune district, but also of the neighbouring districts. Each patient coming to the hospital is being attended without us being aware of their Covid19 status and the testing and reporting of Covid-19 takes time. We are being posted in wards, OPDs and intensive care units, wherein we come in direct contact with the patient. Interns working at BMC hospitals have been granted Rs 50,000 stipend per month during the pandemic and we have a similar demand. We request you to provide us Rs 50,000 stipend as well.’” The letter also states that “while interns working in BMC hospitals are given enough personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, at Sassoon, the interns are directly exposed to the patients and later, it is confirmed that they are Covid-19 positive”. Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director of Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) under which the hospital functions, said, “The BMC has offered to pay its interns Rs 50,000 per month and so this decision to hike the stipend needs to be taken at the local level. Also, the stipend cannot be hiked across the state for a few students. There are only 200 beds at Sassoon and so, only a few of the interns are attending to these patients in rotation, such a decision cannot be taken by the DMER.” Dr Parag Patil, a final year student working and studying at BJ medical college, said, “ We are working in Covid and non-covid wards every alternate week and so, the pressure on us is comparable to the doctors working in any Covid-19 hospital in the city. We are ready to work, but currently our stipend is too less as compared to Mumbai and we would want it to be on similar lines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-s-sassoon-interns-write-to-minister-demanding-hike-in-stipend/story-vu2TMGKCGCMQLMP092sSbJ.html

15-06-2020||Chandigarh||Guilty of Covid-19 until proven otherwise||There’s no good time to get unwell, certainly not during a pandemic. God forbid if you have fever, restlessness, cough or fatigue. But I wasn’t so lucky. I called up a doctor and was asked if I had difficulty in breathing or if I had travelled in the past month. The appointment was fixed after I answered in the negative.Lockdown times have changed every aspect of life be it working, teaching, learning, conferencing, commerce or dispensation of justice. Rules have changed. The basic tenet of jurisprudence is that one is innocent until proven guilty. Today, every person is guilty of Covid-19 until proven otherwise.I drove to the hospital and was ushered in after a thermal screening. An air of fear hung heavy. Blood tests were carried out. My heartbeat and blood pressure shot up. With an eagle’s eye, the doctor scanned the chest report, checked the pulse and declared admission in the ICU. I was wheeled in where another doctor was waiting to attach nodes and monitor the ECG.A corona warrior in protective gear took the swab samples before I was moved into the main ICU. I felt like a monk in the patient’s attire. All my belongings were put away one by one.I rolled over into bed only to find that the nodes fixed and connected to the overhead monitor. A plastic band with my name, date of birth, patient number and date of admission were slipped onto my left arm, making me feel firmly entrenched.Two patients shared a small space between glass panels with curtains in between. There were several such partitions along the narrow passage. Doctors and nurses were on the move and the team spirit was palpable.I was among the few conscious patients in the unit. For dinner, I thought it was customary to get khichdi till a nurse asked, “Uncle, do you have teeth?” I replied in the affirmative only to be told, “Then why are you having khichdi?”Nevertheless, I gulped down the bland dinner, while the monitors kept beeping in the background day and night. The volume would go up if the heartbeat of any patient rose or the oxygen level went down. A sink right opposite added to my woes.The next morning, I was told that I’d tested negative for Covid-19. I was shifted to an extension of the ICU with four beds. On peering out of the window, I saw the minaret of a gurdwara before spotting the reflection of a temple. Reassured, I started re-reading The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz, a descendant of the Toltecs. According to the Toltecs, your mind is a dream where a thousand people talk at the same time and nobody understands each other so you can’t see what you really are.As I sat beside the window wondering if all this is real, I asked myself: Where am I? Minutes later, the psychiatrist asked the same question! Not satisfied with the reply that I’m retired and settled in Chandigarh, I was asked: When and why did you come here? Finally, the doctor was satisfied with my cognitive abilities and cleared me for discharge.In these tough times, our doctors and nurses have an arduous task at hand. But I always found them stretching beyond the call of duty, reporting before time despite commuting long distances and working away from home for days together. As I drove home, I saluted their dedication and perseverance that had put me firmly on the road to recovery. jaspalsingh1019@gmail.comThe writer is a Chandigarh-based retired chief commissioner of income tax, northwest||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/guilty-of-covid-19-until-proven-otherwise/story-gemgB8WkyC0Cz8hWOapYIK.html

15-06-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan MLAs to stay put at hotel till Rajya Sabha election||Congress general secretary Avinash Pande said on Monday that the legislators who are supporting the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan would continue to stay together at a hotel till the Rajya Sabha election due to the alleged poaching threat from the BJP. Pande said the legislators had been staying like a family and various, adding that brainstorming sessions and discussion on the future roadmap for the development of the state were being held at the hotel, where the legislators have been kept after discussion with them. According to Pande, special operations group of the Rajasthan Police is investigating the alleged attempts to poach and destabilise the state government, and the report is likely to come soon. Pande said the Independent MLAs and legislators of other parties had supported the government, which took the number to 125 (including 107 Congress MLAs) in the House of 200. “It was decided that the legislators will stay together so that the BJP’s attempts, which the party did in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, could not succeed in Rajasthan,” he told reporters at the JW Marriott hotel in Jaipur. “We are staying like a family and this is a blessing in disguise.” Asked about the Food and Civil Supplies Minister Ramesh Meena’s absence, Pande said the Sapotra MLA was away due to some “personal reasons”, but he was in touch and would will follow the party directions. Meanwhile, a letter written to Pande by a MLA Bharat Singh surfaced on Monday, in which the legislator had pointed out that most of the Rajya Sabha MPs “do not even recognise” the legislators, who elect them. Singh alleged that the upper House MPs had nothing to do with anyone after the elections get over. In the letter written on June 11, the former minister said senior leaders of the party were focusing on the Rajya Sabha elections with seriousness despite the fact that two seats were sure to be won by the party. He pointed out that the Congress could win the Lok Sabha election, too, if the party leaders started working in the same manner. Asked about it, Pande acknowledged that Singh had written the letter and expressed his sentiments in a “positive way”. On the cabinet expansion, Pande said discussion would be held at the right time. Government chief whip Mahesh Joshi, who filed complaints alleging attempts to destabilise the state government said he would elaborate on it once his statement is recorded by the Special Operations Group of the police. Sources said Joshi had handed over some evidence in connection with the attempts. The MLAs were taken to a luxury resort last week for discussion on the June 19 Rajya Sabha election and later they were shifted to JW Marriott on Friday. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has alleged that the BJP was conspiring to poach the MLAs in order to destabilise his government, a charge denied by the saffron party. Elections to three Rajya Sabha seats will be held on July 19 for which the Congress has nominated K C Venugopal and Neeraj Dangi, while the BJP has fielded Rajendra Gehlot and Onkar Singh Lakhawat. In the assembly of 200, the Congress has 107 MLAs and has the support of Independent MLAs and legislators of other parties like the Rashtriya Lok Dal, CPI(M) and the Bhartiya Tribal Party, taking the number of legislators on its side to 125. The ruling Congress has more than enough majority to win two seats and the BJP, which has 72 MLAs and support of three Rashtriya Loktantrik Party MLAs, has the numbers to comfortably win just one seat.

15-06-2020||Delhi||Spreading corona awareness, one wall at a time||A network of youth volunteers under the Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan (NYKS) is helping raise awareness about Covid-19 pandemic through street art and wall paintings. The NYKS comes under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, and has a network of 8.5 million youth spread across 623 districts in the country. This community outreach is not just happening in the Capital, and is spread in various cities. Crisp messaging, colourful visuals and catchy slogans have made these walls a symbol of our fight against coronavirus and will go down in the city’s history as a reminder of our resilience.“We have a pool of volunteers across our nine offices in Delhi. These National youth volunteers are part of our community outreach programmes under the guidance of our district officers. When this pandemic spread, we tapped into social media to help create awareness and extend help. After lockdown relaxations, our volunteers started distributing food, making posters, and painting walls with the support of the district administration,” says Nand Kumar Singh, state director, NYKS Delhi.Read: 86-year old Delhi resident shines a ray of hope in these grim times by defeating Covid 19These volunteers are in direct contact with the community and work at the grassroots. To become a volunteer, it is necessary to have passed the class X CBSE exams, and the age cap is 29 years. The idea is to hone rural youth physically, mentally and morally, and to integrate them with the mainstream so that they become responsible citizens.Vikas Kumar, an 18-year old volunteer from North-East Delhi district, was 14-years old when he started volunteering for NYKS. He completed his higher secondary education from Kendriya Vidyalaya and is currently working with five other volunteers. “We made paintings in Ganga Vihar, Amar Colony, Tunda Nagar and Johri Pur. We were told that we have to spread awareness about coronavirus and it was upto us to decide how to go about it. We went door-to-door making announcements, distributing masks and talking to residents about their problems. I have always wanted to be involved in this kind of work and help others,” he says, sharing that there is still a long way to go before stigmas around the virus are removed.Wall paintings are an effective tool of communication, because they don’t just beautify a place, but also catch more eyeballs. Nisha Kumari, district youth coordinator for New Delhi district, says, “We have covered the areas of RK Puram, Chanakya Puri, Delhi Cantonement. Wall paintings look very attractive and draw the attention of passers-by. It is something that elicits feelings of happiness and you can’t miss it,” she says.Volunteers are allocated as per the requirement of the districts. Poonam Sharma, district youth coordinator for North district, says, “I have 11 volunteers who are involved in making posters, painting walls and helping the elderly. We are conducting slogan-writing competitions and mask-making drives to engage with the community. Dry ration and cooked food is being distributed by these volunteers,” she explains. The response has been fairly positive in her district, save for some who are the worst-hit by the pandemic. “Many of them didn’t have ration cards so our volunteers helped get their e-ration cards,” she adds.Read: Mumbaiwale: The 20 coolest city chroniclers on InstagramRajesh Kumar Jadon, district youth coordinator for Central district is working with 13 volunteers at present. “We are working in Yamuna Bazaar, Karol Bagh and Paharganj. Our volunteers have enlisted the help of some painters to help polish the walls because not everyone is comfortable trusting just about anyone to paint their walls,” he says. His volunteers stitched 1,500 masks, cooked and distributed food, and provided stationery to kids who are studying at home. “One of our volunteers got a sanitization machine and sprayed around 50 houses for eight days,” he shares.Interact with Etti Bali @TheBalinianFollow @htcity for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/spreading-corona-awareness-one-wall-at-a-time/story-lnN4bCnVExB7YNcvUCRMTK.html

A total of 14 cruise liners are to dock at the Mumbai Port Trust to disembark 10,000 Indian crew members by June 28, Sanjay Bhatia said in a statement. “During the lockdown period, Mumbai Port has continued to handle large range of cargo such as steel, sugar, pulses, fertilizers, cement, motor vehicles, crude oil and chemicals, among others, at its berths in Indira Docks, Marine Oil Terminal-Jawahar Dweep, Chemical Terminal-Pirpau, and midstream. The port handled 9.6 million metric tons of cargo from 321 vessels,” Bhatia said.

15-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi civic bodies offer schools and community centres for Covid beds||The three municipal corporations in Delhi on Sunday offered all their community centres, schools and health facilities to the Delhi government to ramp up health care infrastructure to deal with the rising cases of Covid-19 in the national capital. This comes on a day when the Delhi government declared the north civic body’s Hindu Rao Hospital a dedicated Covid-19 facility.The leaders of the three municipal corporations — north, south, east — made the offer during a meeting chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah and attended by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, mayors and deputy mayors and commissioners of the three civic bodies, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Randeep Guleria and other senior officials. It was the second high-level meeting held on the day in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis in the Capital. The city reported 2,224 cases on Sunday, taking the total number of infections to 41,182. As many as 1,327 people have died due to the disease in Delhi. Shah held the first meeting with Baijal, Kejriwal, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, and senior officials of the Union home and health ministries and the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).The home minister stressed the need for mutual coordination to fight the pandemic and make the national capital “Corona-free”. He directed the Centre, the Delhi government and the municipal corporations to ensure proper implementation of the decisions taken in the first meeting, such as house-to-house survey and increased Covid-19 testing, according to the statement issued by the home ministry.With Hindu Rao hospital now a dedicated Covid-19 facility, north corporation Mayor Avtar Singh said, “We have extended our support to the Delhi government to fight this pandemic. There are other hospitals and our staff is working hard to provide the best possible care.”Hindu Rao hospital has about 980 beds – including 17 ventilators, eight intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and four high dependency unit (a step-down from the ICU). Another 250 beds have oxygen support on them, according to the north civic body.There are 209 patients currently being treated in the hospital, and they will be moved to Kasturba Hospital, Rajan Babu Hospital, and Giridharilal Hospital.“Modifications will be made in terms of manpower deployment, infrastructure and facilities related to patient care and health care workers,” said north civic body spokesperson Ira Singhal.The three corporations together run eight hospitals with over 2,800 beds. The south and east corporations have offered their community centres, schools and hospitals, which they said can be turned into Covid-19 facilities as and when the government needs. The two corporations have 71 and 95 community centres respectively. “All our community centres are completely air-conditioned. It was also discussed that efforts should be made to ensure that there is no delay in cremating those who have lost their lives to Covid-19,” said Rajdutt Gahlot, deputy mayor of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation.While the corporations have extended their support to the Delhi government, the east and north corporations raised the issue of funds shortages.East Delhi mayor Anju Kamalkant said, “We requested the government to pay us ₹470 crore so that we can effectively carry out Covid-19 management work.”With GTB hospital in east Delhi being designated a dedicated Covid-19 hospital, east Delhi mayor said the load on Swami Dayanand hospital has increased. The body has sought permission from the Delhi government to increase the beds in the hospital from 370 beds to 500.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-civic-bodies-offer-schools-and-community-centres-for-covid-beds/story-k8IISTBjNTnXTzdZbcZ4XP.html
15-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi government withdraws order to convert Nursing homes into Covid centres||The Delhi government has withdrawn its order to convert private nursing homes in capital with 10 to 49 beds into Covid nursing homes within a day of its release. The move announced on Sunday morning was supposed to add 5,000 beds to Delhi’s total capacity for treatment of coronavirus patients.The decision was widely seen as part of frantic efforts by the Delhi government to ensure the availability of close to 80,000 beds dedicated to Covid-19 patients’ treatment by the end of July, when the total number of cases are expected to rise to 5.5 lakh by one estimate, overwhelming the city’s health infrastructure if advance preparations are not made.“In order to avoid intermingling of Covid and non-Covid patients in small & medium multi-specialty nursing homes (10 bedded to 49 bedded) and also to augment the bed capacity for Covid-19 patients, all nursing homes in NCT of Delhi having bed strength of 10 beds or more upto 49 beds are declared as Covid nursing homes,” the order said this morning. It had, however, left standalone facilities like eye centres, dialysis centres, maternity homes from its purview.The Delhi government’s move this morning was also seen in the context of criticism that the city’s health infrastructure was cracking under pressure and over the highlighted cases of undignified handling of bodies, which even invited the Supreme Court’s ire.Another government estimate based on projections using mathematical models has predicted coronavirus cases in the capital’s rise to 100,000 cases by June end, which would necessitate the availability of at least 15,000 hospital beds for treatment of moderate and severe cases.In another important and related development, the Union ministry of health directed hospitals in the city to tweak the protocol and immediately hand over the bodies of suspected Covid-19 fatalities to their relatives without waiting for lab confirmation of their Covid status.“In compliance with orders of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Union Health Ministry directs that bodies of suspected Covid-19 cases in Delhi be handed over to relatives immediately without waiting for lab confirmation,” the order said.Several hospitals had blamed the need to keep bodies till confirmation of their lab reports as one major reason for the difficulty in managing the bodies which were allegedly found piling up in some hospitals as per media reports cited in the court.The ministry has also set up three teams of four doctors each from AIIMS Delhi, directorate general of health services, Union health ministry and Delhi government to inspect major dedicated Covid-19 facilities proposed in Delhi and make recommendations for improvement.Union home minister Amit Shah had also announced a comprehensive health survey of every person in Delhi containment zones to check the spread of coronavirus apart from the ambitious plan to treble testing within six days.Shah also said that a committee would be set up to allocate 60 per cent beds in private hospitals at a lower rate for coronavirus patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-government-withdraws-order-to-convert-nursing-homes-into-covid-centres/story-iv6guKKtC3k9dIAkhqVLAI.html
15-06-2020||Mumbai||‘Need transparency in rules for cancelled flights, return of fares’||As airlines are refusing to return the fare amount to customers for cancelled flights in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the consequent lockdown, passenger bodies and experts are asking airline companies to be transparent about rules. Instead of returning the funds, airlines are issuing credit vouchers to passengers to travel on the same sector in the future.“Credit shell with previous refunds unresolved is unfortunate. Passengers should be informed transparently in advance that no refund will be provided. Consumers have to deal with high fares and no refunds in the most sensitive times. Charging for date change due to cancellations of flights by airlines adds to the misery,” said Kapil Kaul, chief executive officer of South Asia, Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA), a global aviation consultancy. Sudhakara Reddy, president of Air Passengers Association of India (APAI), said that a case was filed because passengers are forced by airlines to fly on the same sector. “Air travel is chosen by many in emergency, business or tourism-related travel. Once the purpose of travel no longer exists, why will the passenger want to travel in the same sector again? There are many who are affected as they spent big amount to book air tickets,” he said.On Friday, a bench of Supreme Court judges, justices Ashok Bhushan, SK Kaul and MR Shah, on Friday asked the Centre as well as airline companies to discuss the modalities for full refund of tickets for all flights, which were cancelled owing to the lockdown and to work out ways to provide full refund to travellers. The court will hear the matter after three weeks.Meanwhile, the Mumbai Grahak Panchayat (MGP), a city-based consumer rights organisation, sought the intervention of the civil aviation ministry. On June 9, the organisation asked the aviation minister to hold a meeting with all stakeholders to discuss a mutual solution over the refund policy in the interest of the passengers. Honey Sharma, a Mira Road resident, who booked a flight to Delhi in March, said, “I booked my air ticket twice and my flights were cancelled on both occasions. Around ₹13,000 are stuck with the airlines which they are not ready to refund. I cannot afford to book my ticket for the third time and risk more money.” Andheri resident Sachin Holmukhe also booked ticket to Himachal Pradesh for May 15 in March for a trek that is held only in summers. His flight was cancelled owing to the lockdown. “I do not know if the Himachal government will allow treks anytime soon or if I will be able to travel for it the next year. So I wanted my money back. But with the airline refusing to provide a refund, the least I can expect is for them to give me an open ticket so I can utilise it for some other sector,” he said. On June 4, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) issued guidelines to member states, asking airlines to respect passengers’ right to refund for flights cancelled due to lockdown and said airlines should not deny refund amount. Taking note of difficulties faced by airlines, the guidelines also stated credit vouchers can be issued only if passengers are okay accepting them instead of refund.A retired airline official said, “There is no doubt that the airlines are not doing justice by refusing to provide refund. Moreover, the airlines have even declared to charge the passengers with fare difference, if any. Hence, airlines should at least increase the validity of the open ticket [currently air tickets are valid for travel upto a year] and allow passengers to travel other sectors too. “||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/need-transparency-in-rules-for-cancelled-flights-return-of-fares/story-qvKV8MXATGPxfcpm9iX1xL.html

The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), while maintaining that there was no mix up from their side, said it is willing to pay for the mother and child’s hospital expenses on “humanitarian grounds.” Vishwanath Kelkar, deputy civic commissioner, said, “We sympathise with the family for all the struggle they went through. The civic commissioner issued directives to bear the expenses of the woman’s delivery and Covid treatment. The family will not have to shell out any money, the decision was taken on humanitarian grounds.”On Sunday, HT reported that the woman was tested positive at Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital (Kalwa), and admitted to Thane Civil Hospital (Tembhi Naka). The civil hospital admitted her for a day and later shifted her to BYL Nair Hospital as it was not equipped with C-section facilities. The woman’s husband said the civil hospital allegedly sent a report to Nair Hospital, in which the patient’s name was wrong, raising doubts over her Covid test result. She was again brought to the Kalwa hospital, where her second test result also came positive. Her husband however, claimed that she contracted the virus after staying in the Covid ward for a night. But TMC maintained that she was tested positive on both occasions. The woman’s husband, who is at a quarantine centre, said, “The doctors decided to keep my daughter in a private hospital at Ghodbunder to ensure that she does not contract the virus from my wife . The hospital has not asked me to pay for anything yet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-plaints-of-mix-up-in-covid-report-thane-woman-delivers-healthy-baby/story-swiTTFXA4X1aA0zlp1yd7N.html

With only a handful of staff manually working on results, and teachers working on the gradation formula in order to release subject-wise scores, most colleges are yet to start the admissions process.“We had conducted exams for some subjects before the lockdown was implemented, so while teachers finish assessing these papers, they are also working on the gradation formula. This 50-50% process is tricky and we don’t want to make errors, so it is time-consuming,” said Parag Ajgaonkar, principal of NM College, Vile Parle.According to a statement released by the varsity on May 23, it has requested all affiliated colleges to promote students from non-traditional courses on a 50-50% formula, through which colleges can base 50% of a student’s performance in internals and other projects in the current semester and 50% to be based on the student’s performance in the previous semester. “If there are any internal exams yet to be completed, colleges should conduct the same online or on phones. In the case of exams already conducted, colleges will choose the higher score of the student and consider the same for final results,” stated the circular.A handful of colleges have already finished the gradation process and are planning to start admissions by mid-June. “We are still not sure if we have to wait for the university to give us a go-ahead for admissions or not? Our management has decided to start admissions irrespective of any word from the varsity,” said the vice-principal of a suburban college.In some cases, colleges have already finished training students and teachers in online classes, and plan to implement the same at the earliest. “Training has been conducted for some time now so our college is ready to conduct classes online. We are hopeful of Class 12 results being released sometime soon so we can conduct admissions to first-year degree college and start classes too,” said Ashok Wadia, principal of Jai Hind College, Churchgate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/amid-tussle-between-governor-maharashtra-government-colleges-in-mumbai-promote-students-start-new-admissions/story-L9dKpV7l1rPr10GY2xDZFI.html
15-06-2020||Mumbai||No clarity on commencement of academic year, say schools in Mumbai||Even as the state education department had earlier announced that academic year 2020-21 would begin from June 15 (Monday), confusion prevails over the reopening of schools, as with the state government did not issue any circular or a directive pertaining to the matter. Till the time of going to press, the state education department did not release any official communication to schools on the commencement of classes – be it online or offline. While state education minister Varsha Gaikwad did not respond to HT’s calls and messages, a senior official from the department said the standard operating procedures (SOPs) submitted to the state contain details of reopening, which they would be made public after government’s approval. “Meanwhile, teachers can go to school and work on creating e-content for online classes,” said the official.“We have absolutely no clarity on what the government wants us to do. As circular is issued in the matter, we asked teachers to try and come once a week on a rotational basis and do some work related to the creation of learning content in the school. But we can’t pressurise teachers to come, especially considering the lack of transport options available to them,” said Prashant Redij, spokesperson of the Mumbai Principals Association. While some schools are planning to start a few online classes from Monday, they framed their own schedules in the absence of instructions. “We are currently planning to teach for two hours a day until the government gives us clear instructions,” said the principal of a suburban school. On May 31, education department officials said that though schools in the state would not start anytime soon, the new academic year would begin on June 15. This meant that online learning would begin in places where students have access to technology and in other parts of the state, modes such as TV, Radio and physical delivery of learning material shall be explored to continue learning. On June 12, the education department recommended schools to follow the SOPs on school reopening and conducting online classes. As per the SOPs, students of Class 3 - Class 5 can only be asked to attend online classes for upto an hour a day, while those from Class 6 - Class 8 can be asked to attend upto two hours a day. Students of Class 9 – Class 12 can be asked to attend online teaching sessions for a maximum of three hours a day.

15-06-2020||City||Mumbai civic body helplines see rise in calls as Covid adds to anxiety, stress||Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, helpline numbers for mental health counselling are seeing a rise in calls, with anxiety and adjustment issues topping the list.In the past two months, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) helpline number — HitGuj – has received more than 2,000 calls. On a daily basis, the helpline number— 24131212 – used to get over 20 calls daily. But since the outbreak in March, the number has risen to 35 every day.“Anxiety-related calls have increased by over 50%. Growing unemployment and loss of business have triggered mental ailments. Also, with the relaxation of lockdown, people are worried about going to office because of the fear of contracting the infection,” said Dr Amey Angane, assistant professor of the psychiatric department of the hospital.The toll-free helpline number – 1800120820050—BMC-Mpower 1on1 has recorded 45,000 calls over the past two months since its launch. In April, BMC-Mpower 1on1 was launched as a collaboration between the government of Maharashtra and BMC with Mpower Foundation, which is an Aditya Birla Education Trust initiative. A majority of the concerns were related to safety, anxiety about stepping out of their homes, returning to work, commute, work-life balance, and their family and friends.According to their data, 52% of the callers complained of anxiety, 22% had issues related to isolation and 11% showed symptoms of depression. While 5% of the callers had sleep-related complaints and the remaining 4% were for exacerbation of previous mental health concerns. On both the helpline numbers, the highest number of calls was between the age group of 25-40. Due to restriction on movement of people to avoid any possible contraction of the virus, psychiatrists are witnessing rising cases of irritation and anger among people. “People are getting frustrated sitting at home. Also, the negative and fake news that circulated on social media, just worsens their mental health. Many young people are taking out their anger through bad behaviour at home which further increases the tension at home,” said Dr Sagar Mundada, a city-based psychiatrist. Medicines prescribed by psychiatrists often fall under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and in the category of Schedule 10 drugs. As a result, many medical stores refused to provide psychiatric drugs through digital prescriptions. This led to relapses of mental health issues among patients. Dr Harish Shetty, a city-based psychiatrist who had written a letter to the Union Health Ministry on it, said, “These drugs are often abused that’s why so many restrictions have been imposed on prescribing it. But due to refusal to provide medicines through digital prescriptions, the level of anxiety, sadness and depression among existing patients has increased.”The pandemic is also taking a toll on the mental health of teenagers due to limited socialisation and isolation. The effect is more among families with Covid cases. Dr Nilanjana Goshwani, a developmental paediatrician, said, “When they know that a family member has contracted the infection, they often develop anxiety. They also start complaining of symptoms such as body pain, headache and some even develop fever.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-civic-body-helplines-see-rise-in-calls-as-covid-adds-to-anxiety-stress/story-Rz83POhGZM6b1sOAZby9lO.html

Earlier posted as the Jalandhar DC, he will take charge of his new post in Ludhiana on Monday.Just like Jalandhar, Ludhiana is also witnessing a steady rise in Covid-19 cases, which would not be a cake walk, Sharma said. Hence, his primary focus will be to plug the soaring cases.He said his emphasis will be to take concrete measures to bring life back on track along with strict adherence to the lockdown rules.Quoting similar events from history, Sharma said any pandemic brought a lot of pain and misery. “But an important takeaway from such testing times is to keep moving forward. Ludhiana is an industrial city, which drives the economy of the state. Smooth resumption of the industry and business is crucial. But, necessary protocols should be followed at the same time,” Sharma said.He stressed that by acting responsibly and adhering to the norms of social distancing, people could win the battle against the virus.“We just have to make some lifestyle changes to bring down the number of cases. This can be done easily by not acting causally,” said Sharma, adding that he will also work towards ensuring that government benefits reach every resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tackling-soaring-covid-19-cases-immediate-job-for-ludhiana-s-new-deputy-commissioner/story-Vp6zObrBwjDT5VY9rLYJLJ.html
15-06-2020||Mumbai||BMC to launch new Hancock bridge by August end||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has announced plans to open the reconstructed Hancock bridge in Sandhurst Road by August-end. On Saturday, the bridges department set up a 24-metre structural girder at the bridge site along with part of a plate girder.Sanjay Darade, who chief engineer, bridges department, said, “Today we have set up the structural girder of 24 metres with a part of a plate girder. The second part will be completed in another 15 days. After that, with the help of a railway mega-block, we will finish the plasterwork.”One of the two girders required for the new Hancock bridge arrived in Mumbai on June 11. At 63.8 metres, it is the longest girder to be used on the city’s railway network, according to civic officials. The second girder is expected to arrive soon.BMC is planning to start traffic on the bridge by the end of August, Darade said. Civic officials said that the new bridge, which is slated to be 64.6-metre-long, will be wider than the earlier one. The bridge will be ready for traffic from both sides after the asphalt work is completed.The Hancock bridge project has faced several hurdles since inception, and work has progressed at snail’s pace. The firm M/s Jaykumar Infraprojects Pvt Ltd, which had bagged the contract in May 2016 for rebuilding the bridge, had moved the Supreme Court after it was removed from the project after getting embroiled in a road scam. In February 2018, the contract was awarded to Sai Projects, with a target for completion set at 19 months.The cost of the entire project is ₹52 crore. Hancock bridge, which was originally built in 1879 near Sandhurst Road railway station, connects Mazgaon to the Western parts of the city. It was demolished in January 2016 after being declared unsafe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-launch-new-hancock-bridge-by-august-end/story-lkcH5sYcvcfb1WrmELD06K.html

15-06-2020||City||KU yet to give clarity on exam schedule, students anxious||UNCERTAINTY: Confusion prevails over promotion criteria; management to meet today Haryana government’s notification regarding final year exams in higher and technical education institutions is already out, but Kurukshetra University is yet to decide its future course of action.The uncertainty has given way to confusion among lakhs of students enrolled in various varsity programmes and courses offered on campus as well as in its affiliated colleges.The government has made it clear that students of final year will appear for their terminal examinations between July 1 and July 31 and the results be declared by August 7.The management of Kurukshetra University has called a meeting on Monday to make the decision.“The government’s guidelines were issued on Friday, but I have yet to go through them. In this regard, we are going to hold a meeting on Monday,” said university’s vice-chancellor (V-C) Nita Khanna.WEIGHTAGE WOESThe government has announced that students in intermediate semesters will be promoted with 50% weightage of internal assessment and 50% weightage of marks obtained in previous examination.The notification has, however, also categorically mentioned, “If the university intends to take examinations of such students of the campus departments, they may do so.”Many students are finding it confusing and seeking clarity from the university.“Though we have read the guidelines issued by the government, we don’t know whether we will have to appear in the exams or the university will promote us,” said a student of BTech (printing and technologies), mass communication department. Even students of about 250 colleges associated with the Kurukshetra University are waiting for any formal communication.“We are eagerly waiting for any notification from our college about the exams, but there is no clarity yet,” said a BSc second year student of DAV Girls College, Yamunanagar.Kurukshetra University controller of examinations Hukum Singh said, “The final call will be made by the academic council of the university and we will implement whatever decision they make.”Reacting to the problems being faced by students, a senior professor of the university, who sought to remain anonymous, said, “The university should clear the air immediately. Only 16 days are left for the exams and those appearing for them have to make arrangements for their travel and stay.”He said the government’s ‘limited’ guidelines were not sufficient as a lot of preparation and work needed to be done to conduct the exams of final year students and promote others to next semesters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ku-yet-to-give-clarity-on-exam-schedule-students-anxious/story-n7P3lb1iNsZWDI6Ra5w7AK.html
15-06-2020||Delhi||For admission to DU’s music courses, a YouTube audition||Candidates applying for admission to Delhi University’s (DU) music courses for the upcoming academic session will have to upload their performances on YouTube as part of their practical entrance tests, a move necessitated by restrictions in place due to the Covid-19 pandemic, varsity officials said. Candidates will be shortlisted for an online interview on the basis of these videos.The move is part of the university’s temporary shift to alternative admission processes for candidates applying to music, sports, sports science, and physical education courses, as well as for admissions under the extra-curricular activities (ECA) quotaAccording to the minutes of the university’s admission committee meeting held on May 26, in view of the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis, alternative plans suggested by a subcommittee constituted for sports, ECA and performance based admission will be adopted this year.“After detailed deliberation, the committee decided that under the prevalent condition due to Covid-19, the alternative plan for admission under ECA, sports, music and physical education, of having only online admission process, as suggested by the sub-committee be adopted for the academic year 2020 – 21,” the minutes stated.The minutes were approved on June 10 by the standing committee of the university’s academic council — DU’s highest academic body. Arun Kumar Attree, a member of the standing committee, said, “Since it is not possible to call students physically to the campus for auditions or trials, it’s been decided we will skip them entirely this year. Entrance exams for music courses will be conducted online by the faculty of music and fine arts, and admissions to physical education courses will be done based on merit certificates.” In its suggestions, the sub-committee said, “The candidates, for admission to undergraduate and postgraduate courses, will upload a video of their seven-minute performance on YouTube and mark it as unlisted [Unlisted YouTube videos are not for public viewing]. The link of the uploaded YouTube video will be submitted by the candidates along with the admission application form on the DU admission portal.”“The shortlisted candidates to be called for the online interview. The admission committee will conduct the online interview for the final selection of candidates for admission to UG and PG courses of music faculty,” read the sub-committee’s suggestions document, a copy of which is with HT.The university offers three music courses at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.DU has also decided to skip physical fitness tests this year for admissions to BSc and MSc courses in Physical Education, Health Education and Sports, and Bachelor of Physical Education. “There cannot be any physical test or trial in the prevailing circumstances. The candidates may be asked to upload a self-declaration certificate in his or her fitness along with a medical certificate. The entrance test will be conducted for these courses as earlier for which the modalities will be announced shortly,” said a member of the admission committee. The modalities of the entrance exams will be announced in the coming weeks by the National Testing Agency — a nodal agency for conducting premier entrance exams in the country, the member added. HT had reported that the university has also decided not to conduct trials for admissions under the sports and ECA categories this year. In DU colleges, 5% supernumerary seats are reserved under these two categories collectively in each course.Members of the DU’s executive council (EC) — the highest decision-making body — expressed reservations over online practical exams for music courses. “There can be many issues with candidates uploading videos online. Many may not have quality mobile phones to record, due to which the audio quality may be hampered . Also, online interviews are going to be very difficult for many students,” said Rajesh Jha, a member of the EC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/for-admission-to-du-s-music-courses-a-youtube-audition/story-W7zqHYBBTl7w1Yx7gFol1H.html
15-06-2020||Mumbai||State records 3,390 more cases, health minister says peak has started||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 case count on Saturday reached 1,07,958 after it recorded 3,390 more infections on Sunday — the fifth consecutive day of over 3,000 new cases — even as state health minister Rajesh Tope said the pandemic’s peak has started in the state and that cases will continue to rise for the next 15 days at least. He also said that a drop in cases is likely to start from this month-end. Of the state’s tally, 53,017 are active cases, according to the state health department. Meanwhile, the number of recovered patients crossed the 50,000 mark on Sunday, two days after the state crossed the grim mark of 1 lakh patients. The total number of recovered patients stands at 50,978.Tope said, “Fresh cases will continue to rise for the next 15-20 days as the peak has started. The decline is likely to start from June-end. I’m saying this going by what is happening in other countries. The situation in the state will stabilise and things will settle.”The state also reported 120 deaths on Sunday, taking the toll to 3,950. Of them, 43 deaths are from the past two days, while the rest are between June 2 and June 11, clarified the health department. On June 11, the state had recorded its highest single-day increase in fatalities — 152. On Sunday, 1.632 patients recovered and were discharged from various hospitals across the state. The recovery rate has improved and has reached 47.02% from 43% on June 1.Mumbai, the worst-hit city across the country, has recorded 1,395 cases as its case count reached 58,226. Of them, 29,050 are active cases. The city also reported 69 deaths and toll stands at 2182. On May 22, Mumbai has reported its highest one-day spike in cases — 1,751.Statistics show that there has been an increase in new cases from June 3 since the state relaxed lockdown conditions even in red zones such as the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) (the areas governed by nine municipal corporations including Mumbai), Pune, Solapur, Aurangabad, Malegaon, Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Akola, Amravati and Nagpur — the 19 corporations.On June 3, the total number of cases in the 19 municipal corporations was 67,885, which has now risen to 96,369. The 19 corporations also make up 89.26% of the total cases (1,07,958) recorded in the state.The health officials, however, stressed that the situation is also improving as growth rate of new cases has come down and at the same time, doubling rate of new cases is increasing.“We can say that the rate of growth of new cases has considerably slowed down and our case doubling rate is now better than the national average. Daily new cases in Mumbai is almost constant in the last seven days,” said Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, health department.The state’s doubling rate of cases currently is 21.3 days, whereas the national average of doubling rate is 17.1 days.Dr Hemant Deshmukh, Dean, KEM Hospital in Mumbai, also stressed that they have succeeded in stabilising the pandemic as they are getting fewer critical patients in the last few days. “My personal experience is that we have seen gradual decrease in the number of admissions of critical patients in the past five days. I can see two reasons for this. One, we have developed more centres for critically ill patients and second, the disease is probably getting stabilised. We have succeeded in reducing the criticalness of the disease due to aggressive contract tracing. We are getting more patients with mild symptoms,” Dr Deshmukh said.Of the day’s 120 deaths, 69 are in Mumbai, 11 each in Pune and Jalgaon, seven in Aurangabad, five in Ulhasnagar, four in Thane, three in Solapur, two each in Osmanabad and Akola and one each in Palghar, Vasai-Virar and Ratnagiri.Of total deaths reported on Sunday, 66 were above 60 years of age, while 40 were in the age group of 40 to 59 years. The rest 14 patients were below 40 years of age. Of the deceased, 80 had high-risk co-morbidities, including diabetes, hypertension and heart ailments, health officials said.The health department said 6,57,739 tests have been conducted at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra. Of them, 5,49,781 people tested negative, said an official.The mortality rate, however, has also increased to 3.66% (3,830 deaths on June 13) from 3.27% (1,792 deaths on May 26). It is also more than the national mortality rate, which is 2.87%, with 9,195 deaths till Saturday, stated the data shared by the state medical education department.So far, 29,641 people have been kept in institutional quarantine in the state and over 5,87,596 people have been put under home quarantine.As part of the ‘Mission Begin Again’ to ease the lockdown, the state government from June 3 had allowed outdoor activities such as jogging, running, cycling in open grounds and stadiums. From June 5, it allowed shops and marketplaces to be opened and from June 8, it allowed private offices to open with a maximum strength of 10 people. It has further allowed inter-district movement in the MMR and allowed BEST buses to ply in the region from June 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-records-3-390-more-cases-health-minister-says-peak-has-started/story-8ONNqyZe87NSMWAJJmJZDL.html
15-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt plans to increase hospital beds to 20,000 by June 20||Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on Sunday, inspected a religious group’s centre in Chhatarpur that is likely to become the Capital’s biggest makeshift hospital with an estimated 10,000 beds even as the Delhi government announced that it has made plans for 20,000 additional Covid-19 beds in the city by June 20. District administration officials said they expect the facility to be ready for patients by the end of the month.“The visit was necessary to check if the place can accommodate the estimated infrastructure requirements in the light of increasing Covid-19 cases. The district administration has conducted a feasibility study. I came here for a review. More details will be shared in the days to come,” said Baijal, at the Radhasoami Satsang Beas facility near Bhatti village in Chhatarpur.Meanwhile, the Delhi government issued directions to ramp up Delhi’s hospital bed capacity by 20,000 by June 20. Of these, 4,000 beds are to be arranged in hotels taken over by the government, 5,000 in nursing homes and 11,000 in banquet halls.There is no change in the plan for the 5,000 beds in nursing homes, even after a recent government order regarding the use of smaller nursing homes (with fewer than 50 beds) was withdrawn on Sunday.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, earlier this week, said Delhi would need 150,000 Covid-19 beds by July 31, factoring in outstation patients who may travel to the city for treatment.Baijal, on Sunday, reached the Satsang Beas around 1 pm, after attending a meeting chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah. Hours after the field inspection, Baijal joined another meeting chaired by Shah.Both meetings were also attended by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia.BIGGEST MAKESHIFT HOSPITALThe shed in the spiritual organisation’s Chhatarpur branch measures around 11.90 lakh square feet, which can accommodate 10,000 beds if the space is used optimally, said sub-divisional magistrate (Mehrauli) Sonalika Jiwani. She said the shed will be divided into 200 enclosures, comprising 50 beds each.“We expect patients to start getting admitted in this facility in another 15 days,” Jiwani said.A senior government official who asked not to be named said, “It is the first such experiment in Delhi. Cities like Mumbai have also used sports complexes but those have been turned into quarantine facilities. No other city so far has any hospital of such capacity.”At the site on Sunday, HT spotted workers using canvas and vinyl fabric sheets to build enclosures, and arranging polyvinyl floor coverings. The shed does not have a concrete floor , so the polyvinyl covering is necessary to enable periodic sanitation.A combination of coolers and fans will be used to ensure appropriate temperature and relative humidity in the facility, said a second government official familiar with the government’s site feasibility study. The facility has two toilets, and more temporary ones are likely to be set up in a week or so, the official said.But a major challenge is a shortage of medical staff in the Capital. The senior government official quoted above who asked not to be named said the makeshift hospital in Chhatarpur will operate in two shifts, with each needing at least 200 doctors and 400 nurses and paramedics when operating at full capacity.“We are trying to work out a strategy for that along with the health department,” the official said.The central government has classified Covid-19 facilities into three categories – Covid care centres, dedicated health centres and dedicated Covid hospitals. The first two are meant for mild to moderate category patients, and hospitals are for those who need specialised support such as ICUs and ventilators.The makeshift hospitals at banquet halls and stadiums – including the one planned in Chhatarpur – are supposed to accommodate mild and moderate category patients with comorbidities who need‘round the clock supervision and cannot be isolated at home. So, they are not likely to have ICU and ventilator facilities, said a senior official in the health department who asked not to be named. Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, emphasised the necessity to have trained manpower. “The Army and the ITBP had earlier set up such quarantine centres. If it is a hospital, proper strategy is needed to cover the management of patient movements, healthcare worker movements, toilets, changing rooms, equipment stores, etc. The government should get trained manpower for help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-plans-to-increase-hospital-beds-to-20-000-by-june-20/story-QoLISwnvnChHye7BNR4KNP.html
15-06-2020||Delhi||Traders’ body says all major markets in Delhi will stay open for now||All major markets in the city on Sunday said they have decided to stay open despite the rising cases of Covid-19 in the city, and scant business. The respective market associations said the decision came in light of the measures taken by the Centre and Delhi government to tackle the coronavirus crisis in the city.With the number of Covid-19 cases rising in the city, speculation was rife that the government could impose restrictions again in some form, forcing Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Friday to allay such concerns. “No, the lockdown will not be extended any further in Delhi,” Jain had said.All major retail markets — including Connaught Place, Khan Market, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Lajpat Nagar and Karol Bagh among others, have decided to remain open.Brajesh Goyal, convener of the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) trade and industry wing said his outfit had scheduled a video meeting of representatives of over 170 trader associations on Sunday. “At least 157 associations said that though business is slow, they will keep markets open. All markets will scale up the precautionary measures to maintain distancing measures. There are only a few markets that may open on select days of the week,” said Goyal.The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), a national group representing several retailers, said that after a video conference with over 270 trade leaders, it was decided all markets would stay open for the time being. In a survey CAIT conducted among traders and retailers, 88% said they preferred to shut their shops.“After the aggressive steps announced jointly by the Centre and the Delhi government to deal with the situation at present, we decided to keep markets open. Trader associations will be free to take a decision on what suits them, depending on local factors,” said Praveen Khandelwal, general secretary, CAIT.Sanjeev Mehra, president of Khan Market Traders Association said business has picked up slightly over the past week. “Closing is not a solution. We have to keep at it while taking all precautions. However, it may help if the government reviews curfew timings, as most customers drop in during evening because of the heat. We have to close early, as with limited public transport, the staff starts leaving,” said Mehra.As part of the Union home ministry’s “Unlock 1.0” guidelines, a curfew is to be observed between 9pm and 5am. All shops are required to maintain social distancing, failing which they may face penalties.While the main Sarojini Nagar market will remain open, traders’ association of the mini-market, which had on June 11 decided to stay shut, from June 15-30, said it will take a call on Wednesday. “While there are nearly no customers and few staffers are available to take care of the goods, we will hold another consultation and decide whether to stay open or not,” said Ashok Randhawa, president, Sarojini Nagar Mini Market Traders Association. Wholesale markets mostly located in densely populated Old Delhi areas such as Chandni Chowk, Chawri Bazar, Bhagirath Palace and Kashmere Gate have decided to stay open partially. Jagdish Mittal, president of Delhi Electrical Insulators Dealers Association at Bhagirath Palace said it was difficult to maintain social distancing and had hence decided shops will open on alternate days.The Nai Sarak Book Sellers Association on Sunday issued a circular that urged shop owners to come to their outlets only if required. “We have requested traders to avoid opening shops till June-end at the earliest,” said Surender Kumar Gupta, a member of the association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/traders-body-says-all-major-markets-in-delhi-will-stay-open-for-now/story-MCXrS5EbK9UtYjla0IExWJ.html

15-06-2020||Delhi||Covid crisis: Thalassemia patients struggle to find hospital beds, blood for transfusion||Preeti Talreja, a resident of Vivek Vihar, had to shuttle between two hospitals before she could arrange for her four-year-old daughter’s blood transfusion after the thalassemia unit at Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) Hospital closed. The hospital was declared a designated coronavirus disease (Covid-19) hospital on June 2.Her daughter Mahi was admitted to an emergency ward at Swami Dayanand hospital as her haemoglobin levels were low. “It was a struggle to first get her admitted and then arrange for blood. After we got the bed at Swami Dayanand Hospital for the transfusion, we had to go to GTB Hospital to arrange for the blood.”Most thalassemia patients who are being treated at government-run facilities in the city are facing the same problem.Of the 13 government hospitals offering thalassemia care in the Capital, three — Lok Nayak, GTB and Hindu Rao—were designated as Covid-19 hospitals on June 14. Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder that causes the body to have less haemoglobin, which enables red blood cells to carry oxygen. Thalassemia patients have to undergo blood transfusion monthly to maintain haemoglobin levels. The blood disorder is listed as one of the 21 disabilities in the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.Ever since GTB Hospital was designated a Covid-19 hospital, close to 300 thalassemia patients have been struggling to get their blood transfusion done.Yash Gupta (25), a resident of Bulandshahr, and Soman Madan (32), a resident of Delhi, have been undergoing blood transfusion at GTB Hospital since 1999. Gupta said that he managed to get his transfusion done at Swami Dayanand Hospital after checking with two other hospitals, Madan got his done at a private hospital. But, like Talreja, both had to go to GTB Hospital to get the blood.Madan said, “It’s a lot of hassle, as we have to first find a hospital which will do the transfusion. We then have to take the blood sample for cross-matching to GTB Hospital, collect blood from the blood bank and then go again to the other hospital for a transfusion. Why can’t the government streamline the process so that we don’t have to do the running around?”The Delhi government has issued clear instructions along with the list of hospitals where patients can go for transfusion. As per the instructions, hospitals have to inform patients where they can go; hospitals will have to coordinate to arrange for blood for transfusion; patient have to get a donor along with them but in case they don’t have one or emergency, hospitals can’t deny treatment, etc. The list includes All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Safdarjung, RML, Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalya, Hindu Rao, Swami Dayanand, Kasturba Gandhi etc.But most patients HT spoke to said they had to go to GTB Hospital to arrange for blood. A senior doctor at GTB Hospital’s blood bank said that most thalassemia patients are coming to the hospital to collect blood. “Most of our patients are coming here to collect blood for transfusion. We are not able to organise big camps for blood donations during these times. Now that our hospital has become a designated Covid-19 hospital, we can’t ask people to donate blood in-house. We are organising camps once a week outside the hospital to meet the requirement.”According to NGOs working with thalassemia patients, there are close to 2,500 of them being treated at various hospitals, especially in government facilities, in Delhi. They are now demanding that the government should ensure that people don’t have to run around to arrange blood. JS Arora, general secretary of the National Thalassemia Welfare Society, said, “In these testing times, patients and their relatives have to run from one hospital to another to check for beds and arrange blood. The government should either have dedicated hospitals where these people can go or put in place a system so that they don’t have to suffer. These are high-risk patients and need a transfusion for survival.”Arora said that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, especially during the lockdown, arranging for blood has been a challenge for families of thalassemia patients and NGOs as not many large-scale blood donation camps—June 14 is Blood Donation Day—could be organised. Patients’ families said that they couldn’t arrange for donors either, as people are scared to go to the hospital.Shobha Tuli, the secretary of Thalassemics India, said, “Patients are confused right now. The government should have divided all the patients area-wise and told them which hospitals to go to. Patients shouldn’t have to run around for arranging blood. In case patients get transfusions done in a private hospital, then the government should pay for them.”When contacted, Dr SK Arora, additional director, Health, Delhi government, admitted that there were problems initially, but now things were streamlined and he was personally monitoring the situation.“We are issuing repeated instructions to all hospitals to accommodate thalassemia patients registered at Lok Nayak and GTB hospitals without any resistance, along with instructions regarding the availability of blood. It will be the responsibility of the hospitals’ nodal officers to see to the availability of blood for a particular patient before sending an attendant to arrange it. We have created a WhatsApp group of all the nodal officers of all hospitals for the coordination and solve the day to day problems of patients. We issued similar instructions when Hindu Rao Hospital was declared a dedicated Covid-19 hospital,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-crisis-thalassemia-patients-struggle-to-find-hospital-beds-blood-for-transfusion/story-04oPG2iwwzxSp7FOHJfQ7H.html
15-06-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Current staff can cater to only 500 more Covid beds, say health officials||Ghaziabad: In the wake of spike in Covid-19 cases in the district, health department officials on Sunday made an assessment of available resources and said that they will be able to cater to only 500 more Covid beds with the current staff strength. After the state government’s directions, Ghaziabad has made a plan for about 4,000 Covid beds in order to deal with any future exigencies. At present, the district has a provision of 166 L1 category beds, 100 L2 category beds at Sanjay Nagar hospital and 400 beds of L3 category at Santosh Medical College. The officials said that the three categories of beds in different hospitals are operational (except 30 L1 beds at Muradnagar) at present, while 200-bed L1 hospital at Niwari will be made operational in a couple of days.The health officials said that apart from the doctors available with the MMG Hospital, Women Hospital and L2 category Sanjay Nagar hospital, they only have 78 doctors available under the chief medical officer and nearly 50% of them are either deployed at various health care facilities or for the services like post mortems, deliveries and emergency services. Besides, a few of them are deployed under the sector scheme in Khoda, Loni and Vaishali.“Of the 78 doctors available with us, we have deployed 12 at L1 Covid hospital at Nandgram while 12 others are scheduled to join our 200-bed L1 hospital at Niwari. The hospital will be opened soon. Almost half of 78 doctors are deployed for emergency services like deliveries and post mortem, and cannot be relocated. About 13 of our doctors are also deployed at Khoda, Vaishali and Loni as part of administration’s sector scheme,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.“Some doctors are also on duty at three of our quarantine centres. So, with the current availability of doctors, we will be able to cater to about 500 more L1 Covid beds. In case requirement goes up in future, we will have to get doctors from outside districts or our three district hospitals,” Gupta said.Meanwhile, on Sunday, the district recorded 19 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the tally to 625. Also, two deaths were added to the tally on Sunday, the health officials said. “With two deaths, we have a total of 22 fatalities till June 14. One of the two was a 52-year-old woman from Vijay Nagar who had tested positive at Meerut. She died on June 12 with complications of hypertension and diabetes. The second patient was a 40-year-old man who was admitted at Meerut on June 12 and died on June 14,” the CMO added.Of the 19 new cases, seven were from Indirapuram, two each from Vaishali, Khoda and Kaushambi while one was from Vasundhara, among other localities.According o the officials, Ghaziabad has now 211 active cases while 392 patients have been discharged so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-current-staff-can-cater-to-only-500-more-covid-beds-say-health-officials/story-AWaARa4pQUqMlGwubnoOGO.html
15-06-2020||City||District court bar association requests sanitization of advocate chambers||GREATER NOIDA: Gautam Budh Nagar district courts bar association has requested the administration for sanitisation to be carried out in advocates’ chambers at the district court located i Greater Noida.“There are around 900 advocate chambers inside the court complex. One entry of visitors is through the gate near the chambers and majority of visitors entering the courts use this gate. Though administration takes up sanitization of chamber lanes, the same has not been done inside the chambers. We have requested that at least once, all advocate chambers should be sanitized. Thereafter, advocates will keep it sanitized,” Sanjeev Verma, president, district bar association, said on Sunday.“Further, the association has appealed to advocates to keep mini sanitization machines at their chambers. All visitors should be sanitized before being allowed to enter chambers. Further, with the machine, the advocates will be able to keep the chambers sanitized themselves. This will help check the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19) disease into their chambers,” said Verma.Advocate Ravindra Sharma, who has a chamber at the court, said he his chamber is in lane 1 and hence requires more sanitization as it is near the entry gate. “I have, in the meantime, decided to buy a mini sanitization fogging machine for my chamber. I request the administration to get all the chambers sanitized at least once.”Court authorities, however, said all areas of the court are being sanitised in coordination with the health department.When contacted, Mujeeb Rehman, the court nazir , said, “As per high court guidelines, we are sanitizing the court campus. Sanitization is being done in coordination with the health department and authority teams. In advocates, chambers we are sanitizing the lanes through fogging machines. Chamber shutters too get sanitized.”Regarding sanitization inside the chambers, Rehman said, “It is not possible as during the sanitization in the morning, the chambers remain closed. Moreover, there is no guidelines to sanitize inside the advocate chambers. In residential or commercial areas, authorities sanitize the lanes and shutters or gates only. Sanitisation of inside area of shops or houses is done by owners themselves.”According to bar association president Sanjeev Verma, “Advocates are offering their full support in the fight against COVID-19. We appreciate the efforts of all advocates who are contributing their efforts and support.”When contacted, district chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said, “The sanitisation is done under the supervision of the authority. If the association requests the authority, then we can do it with their help.”An authority official said on condition of anonymity that upon getting a request they will seek approval from seniors and sanitize the chambers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/district-court-bar-association-requests-sanitization-of-advocate-chambers/story-UeTbI4r21KLPxVMEEHfsnL.html
15-06-2020||Delhi||Kids in Delhi go without vaccine as Covid crisis unfolds||Even as the national Capital resumed the immunisation programme for newborns and infants on May 6 after a hiatus due to the nationwide lockdown from March 25, several factors such as a lack of awareness, limited staff and a majority of Accredited Social Health Activists (Asha)—who are primarily responsible for mobilising parents to take their children for vaccination—engaged in Covid-19-related work continue to impact the process. A month on, several families from marginalised sections have been left out of the immunisation coverage, posing a potential risk to the children’s health.Several women had to give birth at home because they weren’t able to access maternity services during the lockdown. Due to this, newborns missed the dose of vaccination (BCG) given at medical facilities. The dose is crucial for newborns to develop immunity against infections and preventable diseases.Pankaj Gupta, 28, said his wife had to deliver their child at home because the nearest hospital refused to admit her, saying that they did not have beds. “The local dispensary is closed. She is our first child and has turned a month old. We do not know where to take her after birth for follow-ups. People from an NGO had come to the area and told us that we could go to other dispensaries, but there are long queues at the centres. I don’t know how soon we will be able to get her the necessary vaccines,” Gupta, a resident of Sangam Vihar, H-block, who works as a salesman, said.According to Matri Sudha, an NGO working in the maternity and child health sector, a sample study of 50 lactating women who gave birth around the lockdown in South, Southeast and Northeast districts, showed that a majority of them were struggling to get their children vaccinated. “Several dispensaries are closed because the doctors and the ANMs (auxiliary nurse midwife) are on Covid-duty. The health centres that are open have limited staff and long queues, as people are pouring in for all kinds of ailments and medicines. Several people leave empty-handed, daunted by the long wait in the heat,” Ravi Shankar Rai, project coordinator, Matri Sudha, said.He added that according to several ANM and Asha workers, vaccine supply has been halted at some dispensaries, therefore, they cannot do anything to ensure timely vaccination. “The Asha workers also said that they have shifted their focus from vaccination to protection from Covid-19, as the latter is a priority,” the survey said.A survey conducted by the Centre for Holistic Development, another NGO, found that at least eight newborns at Sarai Kale Khan’s slum clusters have been completely left out of the immunisation coverage.Among them is the two-month-old daughter of Shahjuddin, a labourer. She has not been vaccinated since birth. Before he could arrange for an ambulance to take his wife to the nearest hospital, she gave birth to the baby at their shanty. “I don’t know where to take the baby for vaccination. Also, I am scared of exposing her to infection. Before the lockdown, some women workers would come down to take stock of new mothers and infants. They haven’t come since,” he said.The immunisation programme, which had halted due to the lockdown enforced in March to contain the spread of Covid-19, resumed at the city’s vaccination centres in May twice a week—Wednesday and Friday. The Delhi government had urged parents to reach out to these centres. However, many said that they were either not aware of the scheme resuming or facing difficulties at the vaccination centres.Under the government’s immunisation programme, infants, children and pregnant women are vaccinated free of cost. The vaccines include BCG, rotavirus, polio, HIV, pentavalent, measles and rubella virus to be given at the ages of 2, 4, 6,9 and 18 months.The immunisation work is primarily carried out by Asha workers and community health workers. Kavita Yadav, state coordinator for Asha workers, All India United Traders Union Centre, said that a majority of health workers are not able to carry out door-to-door follow-ups on account of their increased responsibilities toward pandemic control measures. “From door-to-door surveys and putting up home quarantine posters to keeping tabs on people in home isolation and supplying medicines at the doorsteps of patients, Asha workers are engaged in a lot of Covid-management duties. They can’t visit new mothers door-to-door and vaccinate the children. Some of them are still visiting children in their designated localities despite the risk of contracting the infection,” she said.Sushma, an Asha worker in Dharampura, said that she is worried about the children who haven’t been vaccinated in the last three months. “We don’t have the time to visit all families so we send them text messages about the date and venue of vaccination. But some parents work as daily labourers or domestic help and don’t have the time to bring in their children. In such cases, we ideally visit the homes and vaccinate these children. It’s not happening now because we’re busy with Covid-related work,” she said.Another worker in Geeta Colony said that their dispensary is under construction and it is difficult for people to stand in queues for hours with their children. “Nobody is allowed inside the dispensaries now and people have to stand outside to wait for their turn. Since we have only two days designated for vaccination, there is always a long queue. Many people leave without getting their children vaccinated after standing in the heat for hours,” she said, adding even as there are proper measures in place at the dispensaries, people fear for the safety of their children.Anju Aledia, the mother of a three-month-old girl, said that she has not visited any dispensary or private clinic yet to get her daughter immunised. “I feel it’s a risk to take children to clinics amid this outbreak. There should be separate facilities designated for children at this time,” she said.However, the Delhi government has refuted these statements.A senior official of Delhi’s health department, on condition of anonymity, said the department has asked dispensaries to vaccinate children whenever they come in. “When the Asha and ANM workers go to the field, they are given a list of children who need vaccination. They motivate their parents to go to a nearby dispensary and get the vaccines. As of now, these services are affected only within the containment areas, as the healthcare worker cannot enter them. Initially, the dispensaries would designate two days a week for immunisation but now we have asked them to vaccinate children whenever they come, regardless of the day, so we can vaccinate as many of them as possible. Also, we have received no reports of an increase in home deliveries. In case it happens, the vaccines are available at the dispensaries; the parents can come and get them,” the official said.Dr Rahul Nagpal, head of paediatrics, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said that mass vaccination has been majorly impacted because of the focus on Covid-19. “Primary vaccination schedule (before 9 months of age) must not be delayed at all, as it is crucial for a child’s health. Delayed primary vaccination exposes children to the risk of preventable diseases. We have already had a few cases of measles recently due to the delay in primary doses. For those depending on public health services for vaccination, it must be ensured that children are not left out, as the effects might appear in the next few months,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kids-in-delhi-go-without-vaccine-as-covid-crisis-unfolds/story-z6zjmwLwvmD4kp2ftXqvcL.html
15-06-2020||City||No room for the poor in Mohali MC’s scheme of things||It has been five years since the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY)-housing for all (urban) scheme was launched in the city, but the Mohali municipal corporation is yet to send a draft to the Punjab government for the notification of three slums, thus exposing the civic body’s indifference to the plight of the weaker sections of the society.Mohali has three undeveloped slums—Udham Singh Colony, Phase 7, Industrial Area with 210 houses; Guru Nanak Colony near Mohali cremation ground with 149 houses; and Balmiki Colony in Phase 6 with 216 houses.The four components of the PMAY scheme include a credit-linked subsidy, in-situ development of slums, beneficiary-led construction, wherein EWS are paid ₹84 lakh for construction, and an opportunity to build individual houses under affordable housing scheme. Two of these components, however, have not been implemented yet.Mohali MC was assigned in-situ development of slums and beneficiary-led construction while Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) was assigned construction of affordable housing schemes.The civic body has so far disbursed only ₹84 lakh to just 76 of the total 234 beneficiaries. Surprisingly, even GMADA has taken no initiative to build houses under the scheme. On February 28 this year, finance minister of Punjab Manpreet Singh Badal, in his budget speech, stated that the government intended to build 10,500 houses during the year 2020-21, and 13,500 houses had already been constructed across the state for EWS.Narinder Singh Dalam, MC executive engineer and i-ncharge of the scheme, said, “We can only develop slums once they are notified and delay in sending the draft was due to lockdown, but we are in process of sending it soon. Regarding the money to EWS, we have identified 235 beneficiaries in a survey in various Mohali villages and ₹84 lakh have been disbursed among 76 beneficiaries.”A senior officer of GMADA said, “We are dealing with only one vertical—affordable housing scheme (AHS). Usually private builders submit proposals that are approved by the committee, but here, no private builder has ever applied.”In January this year, state rural development and panchayat minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa stated that the Punjab government will construct 10,000 new houses under PMAY in rural areas towards which work was already in full swing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-room-for-the-poor-in-mohali-mc-s-scheme-of-things/story-DFmzs6LvxFmdF609K9h0LJ.html
15-06-2020||Chandigarh||Youth injured as shots fired in Chandigarh’s Sector 56||A 21-year-old youth was injured after being shot at multiple times at Palsora village in Sector 56 late on Sunday night. Victim Vinod Kumar, who lives in the same area, was rushed to Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, after the incident around 11pm. Police said he had a miraculous escape as a bullet just grazed his head. At the time of filing of this report, police couldn’t confirm how many men were involved in the crime or that how many shots were fired. A case has been registered under the Arms Act and relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Sector 39 police station. The incident comes close on the heels of two shooting incidents in the city.Five men had opened fire outside the Sector 33 bungalow of a businessman Rakesh Singla on May 31, in what turned out to be part of an extortion racket being run by gangster Lawrence Bishnoi. Later, on June 2, two men opened fire outside a liquor shop in the posh Sector 9 locality, leaving two men injured. Several arrests have been made in both cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/youth-injured-as-shots-fired-in-chandigarh-s-sector-56/story-phtVYjHgFEo9jqlAcTOBNM.html
15-06-2020||Noida||Now, exit from Noida will also be monitored||Days after the national Capital unsealed its border, the Noida police from Saturday began monitoring those vehicles exiting the city to Delhi. Gautam Budh Nagar had sealed its border with Delhi in April to avoid the spread of coronavirus cases across state boundaries. According to data released by the district’s health department, 42% cases (June 1) in the district have been traced to sources in Delhi. The district, therefore, continued to disallow any entry for anyone except essential services and those with valid movement passes.However, the past few weeks saw major traffic congestion especially at the entry side into Noida. Delhi had sealed its borders earlier this month, but removed it soon after as the lieutenant-governor intervened. As the Noida Police continued its checks at the entry into the district, long traffic snarls had become common. One reason was that there was no strict monitoring at the entry to the Delhi side. This allowed people, even non-essentials, to cross the border and so, when the returned, there was a long queue at the entry into Noida where police had installed checkposts to check for permission.“There were many people who would leave the city but without requisite permissions. And when they were stopped by Noida Police at the district entry point, they would cause delays. To rectify this situation, our force is now conducting checks on both sides within our jurisdiction to ensure that people who don’t have the passes don’t leave the city,” said Sankalp Sharma, deputy commissioner of police, zone 1.Police said that the weekend traffic volume was low and expect the new regulations to keep it that ways.Noida Police has now placed barricades on both sides to regulate the movement at all border points like Chilla, Kalindi Kunj or DND.Commuters have time and again complained about the lack of coordination on both sides and the move comes as a relief for daily commuters who have permissions.“Every day we face problems and long jams specially during peak hours. People who have no business being out travel and argue with police with their argument being that in the morning they went with no problems so why should face issues when coming back to Noida. This way there will be no unnecessary movement and may the traffic will be smoother,” said a daily commuter.While some people, who have jobs or businesses in the other state, have wanted the border to be opened, Noida citizens support the administration’s decision to keep it sealed keeping in mind the Covid-19 spread here. The Supreme Court has also asked the UP government for answers on why Gautam Budh Nagar is keeping the border sealed. The apex court had earlier asked Delhi, UP and Haryana to form a common policy to tackle the border situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/now-exit-from-noida-will-also-be-monitored/story-xAFWjpgXhuFM6JsjztrolO.html
15-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt reverses decision to turn nursing homes into Covid-19 facilities||Within 24 hours of issuing an order that mandated all nursing homes in the city to start treating coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients, the Delhi government on Sunday scrapped it after it met with stiff resistance from the medical fraternity.“The competent authority has directed that order… by medical superintendent nursing homes to keepers of all nursing homes… having bed strength between 10 beds to 49 beds declaring them as Covid nursing homes has been withdrawn with immediate effect…” says Delhi government’s revised order issued on Sunday.Experts and nursing home owners have argued that the decision would not have helped in handling the Covid crisis and taken away an emergency lifeline for the people in the local neighbourhoods. Most small nursing home owners had found the decision flawed on many counts, and believed it would have worsened the situation rather than providing relief to the people. Many of these facilities, which work with bare minimum staff, are the lifeline for local neighbourhoods. By taking away that lifeline government was leaving people with no option for emergency non-Covid care in this pandemic, nursing home owners had argued.Lack of adequate infrastructure Smaller private hospitals or nursing homes that have less than 30 beds that are meant to handle basic health conditions and minor surgeries. Handling rush of patients suffering from a virulent pandemic was not possible in a small set-up, many said. Complying with the requirements for treatment of Covid-19 such as separate entry and exit, and triaging facility, and enforcing overall social distancing norms, is not possible with the limited infrastructure that they have.“Most of these hospitals are non-Covid hospitals located in residential areas. The move could have led to spread of disease in the particular colony where the facility was located, and would have been a big risk factor for community transmission in the long run,” says Dr Naresh Chawla, former president, Delhi Medical Association (DMA).Lack of adequate testing capacityNone of these small clinics have their own testing labs or investigative tools to quickly ascertain the rapidly changing vital parameters of Covid19 patients. All of these hospitals would have been outsourcing samples for testing, especially Covid-19 testing, that would have significantly increased the turnaround time for reports.“We are just economically viable as we aren’t big, money making corporate hospitals, we would have been left with no option but to shut shop,” said a private hospital owner who did not wish to be identified.Loss of options for non-Covid patientsWith most big hospitals having been turned into Covid hospitals, the smaller ones are where many patients were turning to for routine medical and emergency care. The presence of Covid-19 patients, most felt, would act as a deterrent for non-Covid patients suffering from heart, kidney, or other ailments, and requiring procedures such as gallstone or appendix removal, to approach these nursing homes.There are about 700 nursing homes in the city, most of which have around 20 beds, according to estimates by the Delhi Medical Association.“Where would have the non-Covid patients gone since many big hospitals were already treating Covid patients. There should be an option for other patients also. This was not the right move by the Delhi government, and I was sure they would reverse it,” Dr Chawla added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-reverses-decision-to-turn-nursing-homes-into-covid-facilities/story-coWxjM3Ebl8FODQweie6xK.html
15-06-2020||Delhi||Workers’ unions ask govt to speed up registrations||Construction workers’ unions in the city have implored the Delhi government to speed up the process of registering workers, so that they may be eligible for financial benefits they were assured during the Covid-19 lockdown.The Delhi government has received 29,759 applications a month after it started registering construction workers in the Capital, but only 537 — less than 2% — of them have been issued registration certificates till June 10, a senior Delhi government official said. Officials have said the slow pace of registrations is because few workers have been able to appear for the physical verification process.The Delhi government had in April said it will disburse Rs 5,000 to all registered construction workers in the city. The government has disbursed two instalments of the relief amount so far.Construction workers in the unorganised sector can register themselves with the state government, to be renewed on a yearly basis. The process is online, and helps registered works avail government benefits of welfare schemes such as those regarding loans and pensions.The Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board (DBOCWWB), under the Delhi government, had started the registration process on May 15. As per a notice issued by the board on June 10, it had received 28,828 applications till June 9, of which 25, 040 were for fresh registrations and 3,788 for renewal. The Delhi government kicked off the registration process after a plea in the Delhi high court by social worker Sunil Kumar Aledia, filed through advocate Shiven Verma, sought directions to the government to provide relief to workers and labourers, including those who had registered in the last two years, who would have otherwise been ineligible.Of the applications for fresh registrations, the board granted certificates to 442 construction workers till June 9, and of the 3,788 renewal applications, just 74 certificates were issued.Aledia said, “The numbers are very low, and the government should expedite the registration process.”A senior Delhi government official, who asked to stay anonymous, said, “While we started receiving applications online from May 15, not many construction workers could come in for physical verifications, due to the lockdown. We started the physical verification from June 1. Till June 10, we had received 29,759 applications, of which 537 workers have been issued the certificate. We are calling 100 people to the various centres each day for the verification process, but few are able to come. We are trying to speed up the process.” In the June 10 notice, the board stated, “Few applicants i.e construction workers are coming for physical verification which may be due to reverse migration to native places or else.”Thaneshwar Adigaur, secretary of the Delhi Asangathit Nirman Mazdoor Union, said, “More construction workers should have benefited from the government’s scheme. But the process to issue registration certificates is moving at a snail’s pace. The board is calling very few people for verification, and at this pace, it will take a lot of time to register all workers. Only those who were registered with the board earlier are entitled to the financial assistance of Rs 5,000. But of the 3,788 applications, the board has been able to issue renewed certificates to just 74 construction workers.”Gaur, who is also a member of the advisory committee of the welfare board, added, “The government should deploy more people so that the process can be completed at the earliest. We have written to the government in this regard.”While 5,39,421 construction workers are registered with the board, as of on September 30, 2018, the Delhi government had given the Rs 5,000 assistance to 39,600 workers till May 12.In May, the Delhi High Court had directed the state government to send out proper communication, in the form of SMSs, to over five lakh construction workers, majority of who are yet to avail the financial aid of Rs 5,000 is given to them by authorities in view of the ongoing lockdown. The court also said that those workers whose registration has lapsed will also be entitled to the ex-gratia, but after they renew their membership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/workers-unions-ask-govt-to-speed-up-registrations/story-f2GPE8iyqQtAaKwFZFwXDM.html
15-06-2020||City||Delhi: Bara Hindu Rao Hospital designated as Covid facility||The hospital has been directed to start admitting Covid-19 patients from Tuesday, according to an order by Delhi’s health department.“In exercise of powers under the Delhi Epidemic Covid-19 Regulations, 2020 and the Epidemic Act, 1897, Bara Hindu Rao hospital running under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation is hereby declared as a Covid-19 hospital. The Medical Superintendent is directed to make all hospital beds available to admit Covid-19 patients as per the laid down protocol by 16.06.2020,” the order reads.The hospital has about 980 beds – including 17 ventilators, eight intensive care unit beds and four high dependency unit beds (a step-down from the ICU). Another 250 beds have oxygen support on them, according to the North MCD.Currently, there are 209 patients admitted to the hospital who will be moved to the Kasturba, Rajan Babu and Giridharilal hospitals.“Modifications will be made in terms of manpower deployment, infrastructure and facilities related to patient care and healthcare workers,” said North MCD spokesperson Ira Singhal.The three corporations together run eight hospitals which have a total of more than 2,800 beds. Of these, the government has so far declared only one hospital – Tilak Nagar Super Specialty Hospital – for the treatment of those with Covid-19.On Thursday, the political representatives of all three civic bodies had held a joint press conference during which they stated that they were ready to “hand over” their hospitals to the government to be declared dedicated facilities to treat patients who contract the Sars-Cov-2.“We are ready to give our facilities, like Hindu Rao and Kasturba hospitals, to the government so that they can be developed as dedicated Covid-19 units and better treatment is provided,” Jai Prakash, standing committee chairperson of the north corporation, had said.The government is currently planning to add 15,800 beds in 40 hotels and 77 banquet halls for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in the city. The government expects that 1.5 lakh beds would be needed for the treatment of patients with severe form of the infectious disease by July-end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-bara-hindu-rao-hospital-designated-as-covid-facility/story-eZCRKAjctw7tTF26OrCvrO.html
15-06-2020||Delhi||Govt to regulate sales, storage of hand sanitisers||The sale and storage of hand sanitisers — one of the most effective weapons against Delhi’s war against Covid-19 — may soon be monitored by the government.A senior Delhi government official said that the administration may soon bring a rule making it mandatory for those selling and storing sanitisers to apply for a licence.Currently, the production of hand sanitisers requires a license. However, no licence is required for storing and selling them.“The Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, which regulates the import, manufacture and distribution of drugs in India is soon likely to include a provision concerning the requirement of a licence to store and sell hand sanitisers. Some guidelines are being drafted,” an official in the Delhi government said. A senior officer from the government’s health department said, because of the current situation and high demand for hand sanitisers, the product has been listed under essential commodities, which also helps them crackdown on black marketing. “But better regulations demand licencing for storage and sales,” the official added.Hand sanitisers are covered under Schedule K of Drugs and Cosmetics Act. They usually contain ethyl alcohol (a clear, colourless liquid and the principle ingredient in alcoholic beverages like beer, wine or brandy) and methyl alcohol (a light, volatile, colourless, flammable liquid with a distinctive alcoholic odour similar to that of ethanol [drinking alcohol]). The license fee on production of hand sanitisers contributes to the revenue of the Delhi excise department under the category of medicinal and toiletry preparations containing alcohol. In 2018-19, the state government earned around Rs 20.70 crore under the revenues head, for 2019-20, the revised revenue estimate was pegged at Rs 18.95 crore and, in 2020-21, the projected earning under the head is Rs 19.80 crore, budget documents showed. Government officials said, roughly one-fourth of the revenue under the concerned head comes from the production fee levied on hand sanitisers.“While they are used round the year in hospitals and clinics, their domestic usage has increased recently. Production has increased. Additional license fee on storage and sales is expected to add to the government’s revenue and, hence, a revision in the estimates for 2020-21,” said a second senior official.The Delhi government has already asked local producers to keep their production capacity up till at least June 30, and the deadline can be further extended depending on the trajectory of cases in the city. “There are high chances that the period post-covid-management would witness a large amount of unsold stock, and that comes with its own risks. Hence, regulations will be necessary,” the second official said.Experts believe that high amount of alcohol in a sanitiser may cause accidents if handled carelessly. Professor Ramesh Chandra, head of the chemistry department, University of Delhi, said because the presence of alcohol in sanitisers make them flammable, if stored in large quantity it must be in a regulated manner and with all due precautions.Chandra said there are two kinds of alcohol in a sanitiser - ethyl alcohol and methyl alcohol. “A sanitiser must ideally only have ethyl alcohol. Methyl alcohol is harmful if consumed or handled improperly. We also need to strictly regulate the composition of sanitisers when manufactured and I’m sure authorities concerned are doing their best,” he said.Chandra further said that people must also take precautions while getting their vehicles sanitized. “I have heard that recently a man was getting his motorcycle sanitized, with its ignition on, and it caught fire. The vehicle was gutted. However, a bottle of sanitiser left in a car will not catch fire as the temperature inside the car will not go up so high. It will need a direct spark to catch fire,” he explained.RISK AND QUALITYAshish Grover, secretary, Delhi Drug Trader’s Association, said all roadside vendors, food stall owners and tea sellers have switched to selling sanitisers. “In Bhagirath Palace, they are selling it at much cheaper prices, which reflects on its quality. But if it causes some health complications in the future, the traders will be blamed. The government must sell these sanitisers only through authorized stores like Kendriya Bhandar or through license holding drug dealers,” Grover said.He also said many of the roadside vendors who have resorted to selling sanitisers because they ran out of business during the pandemic. They are also hoarding sanitisers but are unaware of regulations. “Because vegetable vendors and local shopkeepers are not aware of such precautions, it may cause life-threatening accidents,” he said.Atul Garg, director Delhi Fire Service, said improper storage of large quantities of hand sanitisers may be dangerous and can lead to fatal fire disasters, especially in residential areas. “These days, because of the increased demand all shopkeepers are hoarding large quantities of hand sanitisers. These sanitisers have 70-75% alcohol and have a low flash point (highly flammable). Unaware of its disastrous properties, if someone stores alcohol-based highly flammable sanitisers close to an electric switch, or an air conditioner, or an inverter, a short circuit, which is one of the most common causes behind fires, may fuel the fire,” he said.Garg said that sale and storage of hand sanitisers must be regulated. “Because most of these shops are in residential or market areas, in case of a fire, it may lead to loss of public life and property. There should be strict regulations on its storage and sales. Only authorised vendors should be allowed to store sanitisers beyond a quantity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-to-regulate-sales-storage-of-hand-sanitisers/story-wSqv16fXg8xbm8fLIbjiFN.html

15-06-2020||Noida||Noida markets suffer losses due to low customer turnout, odd-even rule||From customers not being aware about which shops are open, to staff not being able to report for work due to sealing of the border with Delhi, many issues plague Noida’s sector markets. They are also reeling under heavy losses -- the one at sector 18 reporting ₹20 crore per day -- and expect to take at least a year for them to recover. The lockdown from March 25 saw some easing from May 21 but customers were hard to come by as fear of contracting the contagious disease kept most away from places that could be potentially crowded.“We are not getting any business and almost every day, our traders are facing losses. Although it is difficult to assess the exact amount but we estimate that approximately ₹20 crore of losses are being faced by traders. We are not expecting the situation to improve anytime soon, not before the end of June at least. It may take at least a year for businesses to go back to the pre-Covid-19 scenario,” said Sushil Kumar Jain, president, Sector-18 market association and the head of Confederation of All India Traders Association, Delhi-NCR.Traders have been asked to follow an odd-even rule -- based on their shop numbers --for opening on certain days and to sanitise their shops regularly. However, there were other bottlenecks. “As such, the customer often don’t know which shop is open and which is not. Timings are also a major challenge. Markets have to started closing their shops by 7:30pm or 8pm. Because the days are hot and humid, people generally don’t prefer to come out during morning or afternoon hours. Therefore peak hours of conducting business are lost. A number of shop owners, staff and customers come to this region from Delhi. Border restrictions are also proving to be a deterrent,” Jain said.At the Atta market, which used to be the most crowded market in Noida, there are less than 20% customers.“Traders can’t even manage to pay for the daily operational costs. Maybe when the odd-even rule is revoked, like they have done for shopping malls, we may hope for some improvement,” said Dr CB Jha, head of the Atta Market, Noida.“For example, there are three stationery shops in our market which are on the same roster, so they close and open on the same day. This is leading to undue competition. Sector 41 market has not been sanitised even once. There are no bathrooms, so no place wash hands either. If these issues are resolved, consumer confidence might improve,” said Rohit Gujral, president, Sector 41 market.According to the health officials of Noida Authority their priority is to sanitise areas with positive Covid-19 cases, but were also sanitising markets.“We have been sanitising several areas of the city using the fire department trucks. However most are containment zones or areas where cases had been reported. We also sanitise a few markets. If there are complaints, we will definitely look into it,” said IP Singh, officer on special duty (OSD), health, Noida authority.“We are sanitising markets every Sunday with handheld machines and portable mist machines. The containment zones are however being sanitised everyday. Based on the requirements, we can increase the frequency at markets as well,” said Avinash Tripathi, OSD Health, Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-markets-suffer-losses-due-to-low-customer-turnout-odd-even-rule/story-ksqPJsC9GRdNYnCt2SFp6O.html

15-06-2020||Noida||Noida police seize four buses going to Bihar, UP districts||Four private buses ferrying over 250 persons to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were seized by Noida Police from Noida-Greater Noida Expressway on Saturday for violating transport regulations.According to police officers, the buses had come from Delhi and were carrying passengers more than their capacities. “The buses had stopped near Mahamaya flyover to pick up more passengers. One bus was bound to Bihar, and the rest were going to various districts in Uttar Pradesh. It was illegal of these buses to get more travellers as they only had single-destination permits and they cannot pick up passengers from places they cross on the way,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (ACP), zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh. The buses were also ferrying goods without permission violating regulations, he added.Police officers said after travel restrictions were revoked recently, commercial vehicles are required to get permits from respective administrations when passing through different states.“These buses had single-destination permits and should have not got passengers to gather at the expressway. It was not only illegal but also an accident hazard. Some private transporters share information online and on social media platforms to get more passengers on their way. We have been monitoring such activities before the lockdown as well,” said deputy commissioner of police (DCP), zone 1, Sankalp Sharma.The police seized all four buses and said action under the National Disaster management act will be initiated against the permit holders.The police said the passengers headed to Bihar were asked to go back to Delhi and make alternate arrangements. For those going to different places in UP, Noida police said it coordinated with Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) to make arrangements for taking the passengers home and they were provided buses on Sunday. The police said that no action was taken against the travellers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-police-seize-four-buses-going-to-bihar-up-districts/story-HXxfuv1T75jXdyVoBl3eSN.html

The district now has a total of 935 Covid-19 cases.The district health department said with four more policemen testing positive on Sunday, a total of 23 persons in Gautam Budh Nagar Police have contracted the infection so far. “ Four police personnel from Sector 49 police station have tested Covid-19 positive. Out of the total infected persons in the force, 17 have been cured and discharged from different hospitals,” a police spokesperson said.Chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Deepak Ohri, said out of the 70 persons who tested positive on Sunday, 15 persons were tested at private laboratories, while the remaining 55 were tested at government laboratories. “ Out of 70 positive case reported on Tuesday, 18 persons are health care workers, four persons are from the police department, and 35 patients have ILI (influenza-like illnesses),” he said. He further said at least 510 patients, including 16 on Sunday, have been discharged from different Covid-19 hospitals so far. “Apart from the 70 positive cases, 73 other patients have been cross-notified to other districts and states. Twelve Covid-19 positive patients have succumbed to the virus so far. The district now has 413 active cases,” he said.The CMO, however, said if the cross notified patients are included in the district tally, the overall count of Covid-19 positive cases in the district will be 1008.Giving details of 73 cross notified Covid-19 positive cases, the CMO said while 22 of them are from Delhi, one patient each is from Haryana, West Bengal, and Andhra Pradesh. “While 10 patients have duplicate entries in the log, the remaining 38 are from other districts of Uttar Pradesh, including 11 from Ghaziabad, eight from Bulandshahr, two each from Hapur and Aligarh and one from Agra,” he said.Dr Ohri further said that nearly 14,000 samples have been collected in the district for testing so far. “A total of 469 patients were screened on Saturday and 16 persons with symptoms of fever have been referred to the district hospital,” he said.Meanwhile, the state government on Sunday finalised the list of 21 private hospitals where non-Covid emergency cases can get treated.

15-06-2020||City||Plasma therapy to Ayurvedic medicines, Ghaziabad plans measures to combat rising Covid deaths||Ghaziabad: Amid the spike in deaths due to Covid-19, the Ghaziabad health department is planning a slew of measures, including the use of plasma therapy, in order to bring down the fatality rate in the district. Health officials have also decided to use Ayurvedic medicines, along with conventional treatment, for Covid patients in hospitals and quarantine centres.Ghaziabad has a death rate of 3.31%, which is higher than the state average of 2.93% till June 13. In the district, only four deaths due to Covid-19 were reported till May 31, while 16 fatalities have taken place in June so far. “I have directed officials to apply for getting permission for plasma therapy, as results in nearby Noida have been encouraging. We need authorisation from ICMR for the purpose. We have blood separation unit at MMG Hospital and the facility can be initiated at our L3 hospital. There are a number of Covid-19 patients who have recovered and are ready to donate plasma,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO).The Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida has approval to administer plasma therapy. “We have good recovery rate. About 7-8 patients were given plasma therapy, and most of them (about 6) have recovered and got discharged. Those under treatment are responding well. So the results are encouraging,” said Brigadier (retired) RK Gupta, director of GIMS.Plasma therapy involves treating the patient with the plasma of a compatible patient who recovered from Covid-19. The antibodies present in the plasma are expected to help the patient fight off the infection.The Ghaziabad CMO further said that he has asked officials for use of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). “To supplement treatment, we have also decided to use HCQ for patients in a quarantine facility. But this will not be given to patients over 50 years and also those suffering from different ailments, including cardiac issues. We have also decided to make add-on of four types of Ayurvedic medicines which will be given to patients in our L1 hospitals. These will supplement treatment,” Gupta added.In the new set of protocols, the Union health ministry on Saturday removed its earlier recommendation of using HCQ in combination with antibiotic drug azithromycin in severe cases. The ministry, in its revised ‘Clinical Management Protocols for COVID-19’, said that the anti-malarial drug HCQ should only be used in the early stages of the disease and should be avoided in critical cases.On May 31, Ghaziabad had a total of 305 Covid-19 cases, but the number has risen sharply to 604 till June 13 with 20 deaths.The district officials on Sunday also held a marathon meeting and decided to implement TTT scheme, which includes components of tracing, testing and treatment.“Under the scheme, the health care workers have been asked to get in touch with about 250 families in vicinity of house of a Covid-19 patient and check for instances of SARI (severe acute respiratory infection) and also if anyone has oxygen level below 95%. Such cases will be immediately reported and taken to a health care facility. Further, an officer has also been assigned work to ensure that ventilators in L2 hospital at Sanjay Nagar are put to use,” said GK Mishra, district malaria officer.The Sanjay Nagar hospital is a 100-bed L2 Covid hospital and has been in limelight after eight ventilators were non-functional and never used for patients. After intervention of the district officials, the ventilators were made operational.“An officer has also been assigned task to ensure that any person having symptoms of SARI should be tested and shifted to a hospital from the primary health centre or the community health centre,” Mishra added.According to the health officials, of the 20 Covid-related deaths till June 13, nine have taken place in Ghaziabad, nine others in Meerut, and one each in Delhi and Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/plasma-therapy-to-ayurvedic-medicines-ghaziabad-plans-measures-to-combat-rising-covid-deaths/story-2Nel0n4yIEAe3pxWZG1loM.html
15-06-2020||City||Highrise towers to be sealed for 14 days instead of 21 days: UP government||GhaziabadThe Uttar Pradesh government on Sunday issued an order saying that highrises in the state that witness Covid-19 cases, will from now be sealed for only 14 days, as opposed to 21 days, as part of the containment exercise.The directions were issued after several residents asked district officials to define how they decided the numbers of days for which a tower/highrise needed to be sealed.“The issue of buildings/towers being sealed for 21 days had been raised by a number of residents. We had a look at it and decided to tweak the rules. From now on, the sealing activity will only be for 14 days. Also earlier, if there was one case, a containment zone of 250 metres was created. If there was more than one case, a containment area of 500 metres and additional 250 metres buffer area was created. Those rules will now change,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health).“We have now decided that even if there is more than one case in one house in urban areas, the containment zone will be only 250 metres or will cover just that one mohalla, whichever is less. A government order has been issued about the new guidelines,” he added.The move is likely to bring relief to residents in two major NCR cities of Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad, which house hundreds of highrises and have witnessed a high incidence of Covid-19 cases.In its directions on May 31, the Uttar Pradesh chief secretary RK Tiwari had issued guidelines, which also dealt with the sealing of highrises and stated that the norms were based on directions issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare.Sunday’s directions are modification of the May 31 directions.The May 31 guidelines stated that 250 metres or an entire Mohalla, whichever is less, will be marked as containment zone in case there is single Covid-19 case. In case of more than one case, a 500 metre area and additional 250 metre buffer zone will be marked as a containment zone.Regarding the residential highrises, the May 31 directions stated that in case of one or more cases on the same floor, only the particular tower will be sealed. In case there were more than one case in different towers, the respective towers as well as common areas — like gyms, swimming pools, parks — will be included in the containment zone.“During the initial stages when the first Covid-19 cases surfaced in one of the towers in Kaushambi, it was sealed for 21 days. Later, upon subsequent cases, officials sealed the towers for 14 days. Now, with new directions, the residents have clarity about the number of days,” said VK Mittal, president of Kaushambi Apartments’ RWA.Other residents said that there is no clarity about the number of days for which a highrise needed to be sealed, which keep changing..“The latest directions were probably issued as there were cases listed in the court. Any such revision of guidelines should be in conformity of Central guidelines. We have also asked the district magistrate and requested him to comply with Central guidelines as per Supreme Court’s direction,” said Mohammad Fuzail Khan, resident of Vaishali.Khan had recently moved apex court to de-seal Gateway Tower highrise and also contended for scrapping of ‘sector scheme’, which is imposed by the administration in the areas of Vaishali, Khoda and Loni.In connection with his petition, the court on June 12 had directed Ghaziabad district magistrate to ensure that all Central guidelines are followed.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to repeated calls for a comment.In his petition, Khan had raised the issue of complete sealing of Gateway Tower, when only one tower was to be sealed as there was only a single Covid-positive case in the highrise.In a similar case earlier, the health department officials had completely sealed Jaipuria Sunrise Greens highrise in Indirapuram, while there was only one case. Later, the chief medical officer directed that only one tower is to be sealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/highrise-towers-to-be-sealed-for-14-days-instead-of-21-days-up-government/story-at3sLpA4EYHcAfCg2OdBHL.html

The test was taken by students of Classes 9 and 10 from more than 100 government schools in the city. A Google form link was sent to students where mathematics questions were asked in multiple-choice format. Sources in the department said the test was conducted so they can prepare a database on how many students attempted the test and how they fared.The initial report on the accessibility of the test submitted by the education department to higher authorities states, “The online test on mathematics chapter 1 (number systems) for students of Class 9 was attempted by 6,500 students, approximately 55% of all government school students in the city. The test for students of Class 10 was attempted by 6,100 students, approximately 50% of the total strength.”The report also states, “The online link for the test was sent to students. After submission, students were able to check their score, which was saved automatically on the back end. The test contained 25 multiple choice questions and each carried one mark. The tests were conducted between 9am to 10am for Class 10 and 11am to 12pm for Class 9.”Alka Mehta, district education officer, Chandigarh said, “We have made groups of teachers, subject-wise and class-wise. All of them decided that there should be an online assessment to know how many students can access online education and understand it.”“It was a simple test. Only mathematics questions were asked in multiple-choice question format. The test was designed using google forms by our teachers,” Mehta said.“Of course, 100% students could not attempt the test because many have connectivity issues, while many don’t know how to operate smartphones,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/55-students-take-first-online-test-conducted-by-chandigarh-education-dept/story-BzsJpCQCH1fuWLsuEoSjxH.html
15-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai local trains to start for Covid-19 frontline staff from today||The Central and Western Railway along with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Sunday confirmed that local train services would be started on Monday for essential workers as identified by state government. After a meeting between BMC, Central Railway (CR) and Western Railway (WR), a proposal to operate local train services was sent to the railway ministry for approval. According to railway officials, approval was received from the railway ministry on Sunday evening. Discussions between the railway ministry and Maharashtra government regarding the operation of trains went on till late on Sunday. CR is likely to operate nearly 200 train services and WR will operate 73 pairs of trains To maintain social distancing, the railways is planning to allow 700 passengers per local train. One 12-compartment local has a capacity of carrying 1,200 passengers, but routinely during peak hours prior to the lockdown, as many as 5,000 commuters would travel per train. A few booking counters will be operated on Central and Western railway stations. The service will be only for essential workers and medical staff, who will be given an e-pass along with details including picture, name, designation, office railway station, residence railway station, and mobile number. The e-pass is likely to have a QR code that will be scanned at the entry point. “Approximately 1.25 lakh essential staff identified by the state government are expected to travel by these trains. It is observed that due to the lockdown, season ticket holders lost a number of days despite holding a valid season ticket. It has been decided to extend the validity of the season tickets to the extent of days lost. The same shall be permitted at the UTS counters at the stations to those permitted by the state government,” read the statement issued by CR and WR.Essential employees will have to undergo a two-level check of railway tickets at stations. The first check will be conducted by railway personnel before entering the station and the second will be done through QR code scanning. The railway stations will have only one entry and exit point that will be manned by Railway Protection Force (RPF), Government Railway Police (GRP), and railway ticketing staff. Barricading of railway stations and restricting public movement inside will be ensured by city police. “Standard operating procedures (SOP) are being readied,” said BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/from-today-local-trains-to-start-for-emergency-workers-frontline-staff/story-zm15AdfpIe3gWeoMZm9POL.html
15-06-2020||Mumbai||BMC spent ₹480 cr tackling Covid-19||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has spent a total of ₹480 crore on tackling Covid-19, since the first case was reported in the city on March 11 till June 1. Major expenditure was towards procuring medical equipment, augmenting health infrastructure and food distribution. Till April 2020, the civic body had spent around ₹100 crore.Additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said, “We have spent nearly ₹480 crore as of now. In the past few days, the expenditure has shot up. This is also because we are not getting donations like earlier now. A majority of the expenditure is towards procuring medical equipment and upgrading health infrastructure.”The exact bifurcation of the expenditure has not yet been released. According to BMC officials, in terms of medical equipment, the expenditure has been towards purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, N-95 masks, three-ply masks, gloves, face shields, hydroxychloroquine, thermometers, body-bags, protective eye-wear, sanitisers, etc. In the past one month, BMC has spent on various initiatives, from enhancing healthcare in the form of jumbo bed facilities, setting up new Covid-19 Care Centres to expenditure towards hotel bills for accommodation of frontline staff, along with recruitment of new staff on contract basis. The civic body claims its expenditure on community kitchens for migrant labourers has gone down as many have gone back to their hometowns.BMC has been utilising money from its contingency fund. In the 2020-21 budget, BMC had allocated ₹850 crore towards its contingency fund – a reserve of money set aside to cover possible unforeseen future expenses. However, if the expenditure keeps increasing in the coming days, BMC claims it will have to work on managing the finances by reworking the budget for 2020-2021. “We are currently spending from our contingency fund of ₹850 crore, and have not reworked the budget to make a special provision for coronavirus. However, in the coming one month, we may have to work it out. There is no estimation currently on the expenditure in the coming days.”According to BMC officials, a majority of their donations are in the form of corporate social responsibility (CSR) or organisations. Although the civic body is yet to calculate the exact quantum of donations in cash, as per its estimates, its expenditure can surge up to ₹130 crore a month in the coming months, if the donations start drying up.BMC, which is India’s richest civic body, had presented a budget of ₹33,441.02 crore in 2020-2021. The civic body had, in the budget, allocated a special fund of ₹2 crore to upgrade the medical facilities at Kasturba Hospital, which was the only hospital treating Covid-19 patients then. Ravi Raja, Congress corporator and leader of Opposition in BMC, said, “The administration may have spent around ₹480 crore, but we are not given any details about the expenditure. They have not even informed or consulted the standing committee of the BMC or the general body before making or ordering purchases. The administration should give proper information about the expenditure to the elected representatives and citizens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tackling-covid-bmc-spent-480-cr/story-waUAImQfw67y1TdXBTQaZN.html
15-06-2020||Gurugram||Two booked for assaulting man in an incident of road rage||The police on Saturday booked two men, who were driving their car on the wrong side of the road, for allegedly assaulting a man following an argument over allowing passage of their vehicle in Wazirabad, near Sector 53. The suspects are yet to be identified, the police said.According to the police, the incident took place when the victim, a resident of Sushant Lok-2, was on his way from Hong Kong Bazar to Marble Market to purchase an earthen pot. As the victim’s car was approaching the Wazirabad crossing, another car coming from the opposite side jumped a traffic signal and blocked his path.A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “In the complaint, the victim alleged that when he told them to follow traffic rules, the two men started hurling abuses at him and alighted from their car. They threw punches at the car and smashed the window panes. The victim then threatened to call the police, following which they fled.”In the FIR, the victim said that to protect himself, he had rolled up the windows of his car.A case has been registered against the two men under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint), 427 (mischief causing damage) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code at the Sector 56 police station on Saturday, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-booked-for-assaulting-man-in-an-incident-of-road-rage/story-SxT0LoprLwLKzLlZ7c0jqK.html
15-06-2020||Gurugram||Senior bureaucrat visits containment zones, takes stock of Covid-19 preparation||A team of senior state officials led by Vijai Vardhan, additional chief secretary (ACS), revenue and disaster management, on Sunday visited two containment zones in the city to take stock of the Covid-19 situation.The team visited the containment zones at Meghdoot Apartment in Sector 10A and Hari Nagar and interacted with the local residents to get their feedback about the steps taken by the district administration and the local officials. The visit comes in the wake of rising number of cases in the district. As of Sunday, the district has reported 3,294 cases, along with 31 deaths, prompting the district administration to increase the number of containment zones in the district from 66 to 98. Vardhan also interacted with ASHA (accredited social health activists) workers, who informed him about how they were conducting contact tracing and carrying out health survey of Covid-19 patients in the containment zones.During the visit, the ACS issued directions that posters in Hindi, providing information regarding Covid-19, should be pasted in the area so that people can easily understand the various facets related to the infection. He also gave directions to provide tents to the police officials stationed outside the zones in view of the summer heat and rising temperature.Prior to the visit, the ACS held a meeting with officials from the district administration, police and health departments and discussed the Covid-19 situation in the district. Later in the day, Vijai Vardhan also visited the Covid-19 call centre established at the Mini Secretariat and obtained information about the helplines operating for migrant workers and ambulances.During the meeting held at PWD guest house, Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, informed that 98 containment zones have been created in the district out of which 86 were in areas falling under the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), 8 in Gurugram bloc, two in Pataudi and one each in Sohna and Farruknagar blocks. “Regular measures for sanitisation of containment zones, disinfection are being taken in these areas. The police have been deployed at the entry and exit of the containment zones and all residents have been asked to download the Aarogya Setu application,” said Khatri.At the control room, Khatri told the team that on an average 250 to 300 calls are being received on a daily on the helpline pertaining to Covid-19 infection, shelter homes for migrants, home isolation, quarantine and other related matters. A team of 40 operators maintain the call centre, answering questions and maintaining data, said Khatri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/senior-bureaucrat-visits-containment-zones-takes-stock-of-covid-19-preparation/story-IWmVSLSdZLylI19eSFsr1I.html
15-06-2020||Gurugram||Digital divide makes it difficult for students to study online||Lalit Kumar, 42, a painter, has been out of work for over two months. Besides the loss of livelihood, the disruption to his daughters’ studies has been a constant source of worry for Kumar, ever since Haryana government schools switched to online lessons via WhatsApp.“We don’t have a phone. The girls borrow one from their aunt and uncle who live in the vicinity, and try to catch up with the lessons,” Kumar, whose five daughters study in government schools in the city, said.A resident of Om Nagar, he said that his family cannot afford a smartphone. “I have had no work for the past two-three months. We have been trying to manage on our meagre resources. Buying a phone is the last thing on our minds,” Kumar, whose wife works as a sanitation worker in a city hospital, said.Kumar’s 12-year-old daughter Manisha who studies in Class 8 in Government Middle School in Shivaji Nagar, said, “I borrow a phone to check for messages from the teacher. There are delays, but we try to do the best we can.” Her sisters also borrow their aunt and uncle’s phone for their lessons. “Officials from the education department had advised us to use a television for the lessons. But we don’t own that either,” Kumar said.Since the nationwide lockdown came into effect on March 25 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), schools across the country have suspended classes. The central government is scheduled to review the situation next month. Although many institutes have taken the online route and the government has also tailored television programmes for the purpose, several students like Manisha do not have regular access to such devices. From affordability to accessibility, students in government schools continue to struggle.Prinshu Awasthi, a Class 10 student of Government Senior Secondary School, Manesar, has been attending lessons since April on WhatsApp using his father’s phone. “I use it in the morning before he leaves for work. If the phone is not available, I try to catch up with lessons via the television broadcast. Earlier, we would not recharge our phone for days unless there was a pressing concern, but now the usage is more regular. We have to recharge the Internet facility more frequently,” Prinshu said.Prinshu is lucky. While he has both a smartphone and television at home, many of his friends do not.“Our teachers have asked them to borrow phones from others or use WhatsApp on their neighbours’ and friends’ phones until the situation improves. However, they say that borrowing all the time is neither feasible nor something that they are keen to do,” Prinshu said.Haryana government initiated the ‘Ghar se Padhao’ campaign on April 14 to ensure that teachers remain in regular contact with parents and students through WhatsApp during the lockdown. While teachers share academic videos and worksheets, they require students to maintain a dedicated notebook to record their work. According to a report prepared by the education department last month, around 70% of government school students from classes 2 to 12 in the district were connected via WhatsApp as part of the campaign.The remaining students have struggled to stay in tune with the rest of the class on WhatsApp due to accessibility and connectivity issues.Kanishka Bansal, a Class 11 student of Government Senior Secondary School, Kadipur, has been using WhatsApp on a phone that his family bought recently so he and his sister Richa could catch up with online classes. “We bought another phone for our mother so we could take lessons on WhatsApp and did not have to depend on others,” Richa said.“Sometimes, they share the links in the morning and sometimes at night. They ask us to make notes and submit pictures of the assignment. Most people have connected to the group, but some are not regular and use phones borrowed from others to share assignments and tests,” Kanishka said.District education officer Indu Boken had earlier told HT that the Internet was crucial for imparting lessons, adding that for those who didn’t have access to the Internet, lessons would be broadcast on cable TV. Some officials from the education department have also pooled in resources to provide smartphones to students who have trouble accessing online classes. “Some children have not been able to access lessons since they did not have smartphones. Not everyone can afford these phones. However, to help, we distributed some smartphones to meritorious students,” Ritu Chowdhary, district project coordinator, Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/digital-divide-makes-it-difficult-for-students-to-study-online/story-eNoxFPLbkv6SJcMYQlxqLL.html
15-06-2020||Mumbai||Balbharti’s prints 2.8 crore textbooks amid lockdown||When the Maharashtra government announced a complete lockdown across the state in March owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the publishing bureau Balbharti was in a tough spot. At the time, nearly 2.80 crore copies of textbooks were yet to be printed while the textbooks for Class 12 were still being revised. Three months later, even as several restrictions continue in the state, Balbharti has distributed nearly 7 crore copies of textbooks and study materials for Classes 1 to 12 to distributors and schools in the state. This remarkable feat was achieved by a team of nearly 500 people working with Balbharti for content creation – including printers, processors, members of the board of studies, artists, and the production team. “When the lockdown was announced, we were scared as to what would happen to the remaining printing process and were worried that book distribution would be delayed. Considering the situation in our state, it was evident that restrictions might not be eased soon. Within a few days, our team decided to do our best to bring out textbooks in time,” said Vivek Gosavi, director, Balbharti. Within a month of the lockdown, several groups of various teams working on the textbooks were created on social messaging applications and people started working from home. While re-printing textbooks for Classes 1 to 11 was a big task, a bigger challenge was to create and print Class 12 textbooks as per the revised syllabus which would come into effect from the academic year 2020-21. “Our members of the board of studies worked day and night to provide content and get it corrected and finalised. The designers and illustrators would send their sketches on WhatsApp and we would give them suggestions then and there. This way, we managed to finish our new textbooks for Class 12 by the first week of April,” said Gosavi. PDF textbooks of Class 12 were made available online from April 8 and have seen over 1 crore downloads to date. As restrictions were eased in some parts of the state in April, printing slowly started in areas that were marked as green and orange zones with special permissions. On May 18, Balbharti began delivering its textbooks to distributors and government-aided schools which provide textbooks free of cost to students. “Around 95% of the distribution work is complete. In the coming days, textbooks will reach students through their schools,” said Gosavi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/balbharti-s-team-of-500-gets-2-8-crore-textbooks-printed/story-LrCTg2gaSrCZsToK2G6xeJ.html

15-06-2020||Chandigarh||Outcry as Punjabi varsity announces exam dates only for ‘local students’||Students of other states enrolled in courses offered by Punjabi University have criticised the varisty’s announcement of examination dates only meant for students of Punjab region. Students term it ‘unfair’ and ‘against the Indian Constitution’.The Punjab University had on June 12 issued a circular stating that exams would be held only for those students who are from the Punjab region.According to the circular, their exams will commence on July 10. A student from Haryana, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “How can the university authorities do such discrimination against students on the basis of their region? There are several red zones in Punjab. Students from there are being allowed to appear for exams on July 10, but students from other states aren’t being given the same opportunity, even if they are from the green zones.”“In every department, there is at least 15℅ occupancy of seats by students from other states. If university can allow 85% students to give exams, why can’t the remaining ones appear?” he questioned.“What is the guarantee that cases of Covid-19 will not rise and that would not make conditions for students of other states worse to give exam in future?” asked another such student.However, Punjabi University registrar MS Nijjar said, “I’m not aware of the circular. I will talk to the persons concerned who have issued the datesheet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/outcry-as-punjabi-varsity-announces-exam-dates-only-for-local-students/story-lKjfi1GM0OptsHzpBWKD2O.html

15-06-2020||Chandigarh||PAU seed sale protocol under scanner after scam||How the owner of Brar Seed Store near Punjab Agricultural University’s (PAU) gate number 1 managed to procure and sell a large quantity of uncertified paddy variety seeds PR-128 from the institute’s Ladhowal Seed Farm still remains a mystery, raising questions over sales protocols followed by the institute.Sale of the seeds was illegal as these were being trialled. Store owner Harvinder Singh Brar, alias Kaka, was arrested on May 31.A police official investigating the case who wished to remain anonymous said PAU had been asked to change its protocols to prevent the unauthorised sale of seeds being trialled.The matter was being investigated and PAU had been asked to explain, said chief agriculture officer, Ludhiana, Narinder Singh Benipal.The matter came to light when the department raided Brar’s Seed Store on May 11 and scanned documents, including ledgers, registers and bills.During the probe, the special investigation team (SIT) found five bills issued by Ladhowal Seed Farm (invoice number IUSFL LDH/2010580 to 4) dated May 4, a copy of which is with Hindustan Times.Four bills of Rs 6,720 for 96kg seeds each and one bill of Rs 8,120 for 116kg seeds were recovered.Interestingly, mention of only truthfully labelled (TL) or tested PR-128 seed was shown as sold and payment of Rs 35,000 was made in cash.No name of the purchaser or mobile phone was mentioned on the bills issued by the farm.Brar had allegedly procured the seeds for Rs 70 per kg and sold them for Rs 250 per kg.The police and the agriculture department were probing as to why such a huge quantity of particular seed variety was provided to Brar, which as per PAU was yet to be notified by the central committee for commercial sale.PAU vice-chancellor Baldev Singh Dhillon could not be contacted for comments.PAU director, seeds, Tarsem Singh Dhillon said he could not comment on the issue.Earlier, investigations in the spurious paddy seed scam revealed that names of newly developed varieties to be sown on trial basis were already known to the accused even before they were officially launched for cultivation by PAU.Brar was booked after a Moga-based farmer had alleged that the store was selling PR 128 and PR 129 seeds for Rs 200 to Rs 250 per kg whereas PAU was providing them for Rs 70 per kg.Dr Naresh Kumar Arora, IPS ADGP/Crime PBI and SCRB, who is heading the state-level SIT said, “We are in touch with PAU officials and they are cooperating with us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pau-seed-sale-protocol-under-scanner-after-scam/story-4SEXITWvKmiyciw9LY6CzN.html

15-06-2020||City||Day after son’s arrest in drug case, opposition guns for BJP’s Ambala unit chief||A day after the son of BJP’s Ambala unit president Jagmohan Lal Kumar was arrested with drugs, the opposition on Sunday demanded strict action in the case and raised questions over the state government’s claims of controlling the drug menace. On Saturday, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader’s son, Amit Kumar, along with an accomplice, was arrested with 60-gm heroin from near home minister Anil Vij’s residence. The duo was allegedly coming from Delhi at the time, the first information report stated. They were presented before the court on Sunday afternoon and sent to two-day police remand.While Jagmohan Lal Kumar didn’t respond to calls, texts and WhatsApp messages for the second consecutive day, the opposition intensified its attack on the saffron party.KUMAR SHOULD RESIGN ON MORAL GROUNDS: SELJAHaryana Congress chief Kumari Selja said, “Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders are competing against each other to violate the law. One of their leaders was recently found thrashing a government official with slippers and now another leader’s son has been arrested with drugs. They are giving assurance of a fair probe but they always cover up such cases.”She further said that the Ambala unit chief should tender his resignation on moral grounds as this is not the first time his son has been caught with drugs. Amit Kumar had been caught by the Mohali crime investigation agency (CIA)-2 near Derrabassi with 30-gram heroin in March last year. He was allegedly selling drugs in the area. HAPPENED UNDER VIJ’S NOSE: CHITRA SARWARAHaryana Democratic Front leader Chitra Sarwara said, “All this is happening right under Haryana home minister Anil Vij’s nose. The fact that Amit Kumar was arrested from near Vij’s house raises a red flag.” Sarwara further said, “This is for the second time that Amit Kumar has been arrested in a drug case, which means he was let off easily the last time.”When asked if the incident calls for the Ambala unit chief’s resignation, Chitra said, “The matter is bigger than that. A resignation is not a remedy. The question is that when the government claims to be taking action against the drug menace, how are those in the political echelons shamelessly peddling drugs.”BARALA REFUSES TO COMMENTBJP’s state unit chief Subhash Barala refused to comment, saying that he was busy with the virtual rally and that the party will decide on the next course of action later. “The issue has come to my notice, but we are busy with the virtual rally being held to mark one year of the BJP government at the centre. I’ll gather more details and see what has to be done,” Barala said.Meanwhile, Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) leader Digvijay Singh Chautala, who had demanded Kumar’s resignation when his son was arrested last year, is keeping mum this time.

This idea was floated by the company to maintain social distance between customer and salesperson, and also to lessen the disputes that often rise while filling fuel. This concept is catching on well, and we are dispensing 800- 900 litres per day of petrol, and 500 -600 litres per day of diesel through the vending machines,” said said Sanket Varude, manager of the pump.“We have noticed that educated people pick up the concept fast, while some, who are not educated need to be taught how to use the vending machine,” Varude added. D Patel, a student, said, “It is my first experience of using this vending machine. It also gives me the confidence that I am getting my money’s worth of petrol, as earlier I had to always be checking if the petrol was filled correctly.”Dr Satyaprem Chole says, “It is quite an experience and I will definitely come back to this petrol pump to try it out again.”Ali Daruwalla, spokesperson, All India Petrol Dealers Association said, “This vending machine is operated at a company-owned petrol pump on a trial basis – using the swipe and dispense method. This is to maintain social distancing and fast track fueling. We are yet to get its results, only then will we look at expanding this concept. It is completely safe and has an automatic nozzle that switches off if petrol overflows.”How petrol/diesel vending machine works- Customer sanitises hands – sanitiser on stand near machine- Enter value of fuel to be filled, in numericals. Pump staff at safe distance acts as guide- Take nozzle, check zero on meter, lift lever on nozzle, then there is a lock under the lever which needs to pressed which allows fuel to flow - Flow stops automatically at the amount to be filled. - Take out nozzle, place back on machine press button marked ‘volume’•5 minutes per customer•Machine takes cash cash, card, and digital payment available with pump staff•Minimum of Rs30 to maximum of Rs 400 for two-wheelers||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/self-service-at-pune-petrol-pump-ushers-in-a-new-flow-of-life-in-times-of-covid/story-XXfoQG0Ywc7QwSdNcPjptN.html

The incident took place in the night, between Saturday and Sunday.The theft came to light after the priest of the temple, who performs puja every morning, visited the temple on Sunday morning.“For now we suspect that the door of the temple was probably left open. There is no sign of forced entry that we have discovered till now,” said police sub-inspector Ajaykumar Patil of Kasba peth outpost of Faraskhana police station who is investigating the case.The metal chest meant for collection of donations was broken open. PSI Patil estimates the worth of stolen currency is between Rs 1,200 to Rs 1,400 including currency notes and coins. The donation box was emptied and last opened around a month before lockdown, according to the police.The temple is located centrally to the market of electronics’ shops in the area. “We are checking for possible CCTV from around the area,” said PSI Patil.The temple has been in a containment zone from several weeks. The temple has a sculpture of Shivaji Maharaj with Saint Dnyaneshwar which is considered to be symbolic of their meeting at the spot, said police.The case under Sections 380 (theft in a dwelling house, among others), 454 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking in order to commit an offence punishable with imprisonment), 457 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night in order to commit an offence punishable with imprisonment) of Indian Penal Code has been registered at Faraskhana police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cash-stolen-from-temple-donation-box-in-budhwar-peth/story-rTexRZcvxsguEXSqVTNFtK.html
15-06-2020||Pune||Civic officials keep palkhi tradition alive, appreciate efforts of residents to fight Covid-19||In a bid to keep the 335-years-old palkhi tradition alive, Murlidhar Mohol, city mayor and Shekhar Gaikwad, Pune municipal commissioner, along with others performed a puja of ‘Dnyaneshwari’ and ‘Tukaram Maharaj Gatha’ near Balgandharva Rang Mandir, on Sunday.The annual palkhis processions of both, Sant Tukaram Maharaj and Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj, have been affected due to the Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.Others present during the puja included Rajesh Pande, president, Samarth Yuva Foundation and Sant Tukaram Maharaj’s descendant Dr Sadanand More.Mohol said, “During this time of the year Punekars eagerly wait to welcome both the pakhis and the city is surrounded with festive fervour. Unfortunately, this year we cannot celebrate due to Covid-19 crisis and we appreciate that Warkaris have shown the right way by not taking out Wari this year.”Gaikwad said, “Performing puja of ‘Dnyaneshwari’ and ‘Tukaram Maharaj Gatha’ is as similar as Wari coming to Pune and we are thankful to the residents for cooperating with us during these testing times.”“This small event of puja has given us a lot of strength to further fight this pandemic,” said Gaikwad.Sant Tukaram Maharaj’s descendant Dr Sadanand More said, “From the last 355 years this tradition of palkh procession from Dehu and Alandi to Pandharpur is carried out, but this year due to unavoidable reasons it was put on hold for the first time. Every warkari waits for this annual event eagerly, but this year too we performed the puja which is appreciated.”The programme was organised by Sanwad Pune and Samarth Yuva Foundation organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/civic-officials-keep-palkhi-tradition-alive-appreciate-efforts-of-residents-to-fight-covid-19/story-TOZjPRQ7UZbvw154mszLcN.html

I cannot say for sure, but this is probably the second such case in the city. The process to claim the body is also very formal, since we do not practically hand over the body. It is for relatives to identify the body to avoid any mismatching, and to ensure the civic body informs the relatives about the death. The body is not handed over till the cremation. Unclaimed bodies are cremated after a proper no-objection certificate (NoC) from the nearest police station.” Dr Poonam Deshmukh, assistant medical administrator, King Edward Memorial (KEM) hospital, where the child passed away, coordinated with the family of the deceased. She said: “Initially when we contacted the parents they said that they are in quarantine and could not come, but when we specifically if the parents had tested positive, they confirmed that the mother and father of the child had not tested positive. The father’s exact words were, ‘If we will not be handed over the body immediately, then what is the use of us coming all the way?’ So we had to inform the PMC about the same and the corpse was cremated with a heavy heart.” The two-month-old child is the city’s youngest Covid-19-related fatality and KEM hospital has issued a statement stating that all concerned authorities were informed of the death on time.The baby, who was admitted on June 3 tested positive for the infection on June 4, and was declared dead on June 7. The death, however, was reported by the PMC on Saturday, June 13.This delay has raised the question about miscommunication between hospital and civic authorities, and therefore, the parents.Dr V Yemul, medical administrator, KEM Pune, said, “We have all the records to show that this death had been informed to the relevant authorities, primary among them being the PMC, on the very same day via multiple channels. Placing the blame on hospitals without any attempt to corroborate facts is only causing panic amongst patients and their relatives and portraying hospitals that are working round the clock during this pandemic in a very poor light. This must now stop.” KEM hospital stated: “The child was found to have an anterior mediastinal haemangioma compressing the trachea and other vessels. During the course of treatment by a team of doctors from the hospital, including a paediatric surgeon, clinical haematologist and paediatric intensivist, a swab was taken and the baby tested positive for Covid-19 on June 4 2020. The baby unfortunately died on Sunday June 7 at 5.10pm. Our administration immediately started the relevant procedures. The hospital statement adds, “We contacted the PMC officers with this information for their guidance for further procedures which includes the death pass, handing over the deceased to the PMC ambulance and cremation; following which, they told us that an NoC would be required from the police station.”“We immediately contacted the concerned police station who promptly gave us the NoC within an hour- and-a-half. Meanwhile, the mandatory procedure of filling of forms was done,” the hospital claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-cremates-2-mth-old-covd-19-victim-after-parents-do-not-show-up-at-hospital-to-claim-body/story-BgjlGPMfeCoAj7unJb7RzO.html
15-06-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra curbs lifted, govt expects surge; Mumbai past 50K cases||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 case count on Monday surged to 88,528 with the addition of 2,553 more infections and Mumbai crossed the grim mark of 50,000 with 1,311 more patients, even as the government expects an even bigger spike in the wake of the third phase of its Mission Begin Again coming into effect from Monday. The state government allowed private offices in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) to operate at 10% of its workforce or 10 employees (whichever is higher). This relaxation, along with the resumption of Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) bus services, saw more traffic snarls on the roads. The state had, from last week, allowed physical activities such as jogging, running and non-essential shops to operate on alternate days in red zones (excluding containment areas). The state on Monday reported 109 deaths, including 64 in Mumbai, as the toll went up to 3,169.The recovery rate in the state has improved to 46.28% after 40,975 patients were discharged till Monday. The recovery rate in the state was 26.25% on May 20, 29.06% on May 24, 31.26% on May 28 and improved to 43.38% on May 29 after as many as 8,381 patients were reported as recovered following the changes in norms to discharge patients. The mortality rate, however, went up to 3.57% from 3.25% on May 25 and 3.37% on May 31 even as the national rate witnessed a gradual fall. The national mortality rate fell to 2.78% on Sunday, from 3.06% on May 21 and 2.84% on May 31. The state health department has clarified that of the 109 deaths reported on Monday, 32 were reported in the past two days, while the rest are from May 3 to June 5. Of the total deaths, 70 are from MMR, eight in Aurangabad, seven in Pune and six each in Solapur and Jalgaon. 59 of the people who died were above 60 years of age and 89 of them had comorbidities.The state government is closely watching the trend and behaviour of the virus after the lockdown was relaxed in a phased manner over the past one week and even after May 22. Officials from the team of bureaucrats taking decisions on the curbs and relaxations said that there was no surge in cases in the districts after the lockdown was relaxed. “There was a rise in the cases in districts like Nashik, Aurangbad, Nashik after the lockdown was lifted in the third week of May, but it was not a surge. The rise is proportional and the doubling rate of cases in these areas is improving. There was no exponential growth in cases. However, contrary to it, we still expect a surge in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune and Aurangabad after the relaxations from curbs in three phases over the past one week,” said the officer.The officer said that the surge, however, should not be always related to the opening up of the lockdown. He said that few municipal corporations, including Nagpur and Malegaon, have successfully contained the spread and maybe given more relaxations in the next phases. “There is no discussion held on the next phase of the Mission Begin Again as it will all depend on the trend witnessed in MMR, Pune and other cities like Solapur, Aurangbad after the rolling out of relaxations,” he said. According to a report published on Monday by the Medical Education and Drug Department, among the admitted patients, 83% are asymptomatic, while 13% are symptomatic and 4% critical. The report stated that the highest number of Covid-19 cases is in the age group of 31-40 years with 20.29%, followed by 19.33% of patients between 21 and 30 years. Another official said that a next phase of Mission Begin Again cannot be implemented unless resumption of suburban trains facilities in MMR. “Barring industrial units, malls, multiplexes, almost everything else has been opened, even in red zones. We cannot increase the percentage of employees for private offices or allow more industrial-commercial activities unless suburban trains are allowed. We expect suburban train services to be allowed by the Centre, beginning with essential/emergency services soon,” he said.The official said that district authorities and the municipal corporations have been directed to focus on a two-fold strategy. He said that they have been told to augment the health infrastructure on one hand and contain the spread by strict implementation of curbs in containment zones. The authorities have been told to go for aggressive tracing of high and low-risk contacts of patients and identify them within 24 hours. “They have been told to closely monitor travellers entering into districts and municipal jurisdictions from affected cities like Mumbai and Pune,” he said. A total of 12,684 samples have been tested in the past 24 hours, with a positivity rate of 20.12%. The state has 3,510 containment zones, which have greater curbs of lockdown in place, while 17,895 surveillance teams ensure tracing of contacts. Currently, 5,64,736 people are under home quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-curbs-lifted-govt-expects-surge-mumbai-past-50k-cases/story-NcdcdiGxvJszfeF8le3xKI.html

The attempt failed after He’s son escaped and swam across a lake to raise the alarm, Forbes reported.He has a net worth of about $24 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Police in Foshan, a city in the southern Guangdong province, said they received a report at 5:30 p.m. Sunday that someone broke into an apartment in a residential community owned by Midea and threatened the homeowner’s safety, according to a statement on their official WeChat account.Five suspects were arrested early Monday, according to the police.Midea Group reposted the police statement on its official Weibo account without elaborating. A company representative told Bloomberg the case is under investigation by police and that Midea had no other details to share.Midea, founded in 1968, is known for its low- to medium-end appliances. He retired as chairman in 2012, after building the company into China’s biggest exporter of air conditioners. The stock closed 3.3% after the close in Shenzhen Monday.Worries about kidnapping have prompted more of the world’s richest people to spend millions of dollars on security in recent years.Walls, fences or other barriers surrounding homes of the ultra-wealthy are typically equipped with motion sensors and monitored by cameras that can be programmed to recognize certain faces. Some are tailed by bodyguards at all hours.

His statue in Parliament Square has been boarded up after protestors wrote ‘was a racist’ below it.Johnson, who has opposed attempts to remove statues of historical figures demanded by BLM protestors, wrote in The Daily Telegraph that much has changed in the UK on race, but admitted that there is much more than needs to be done.Author of a 2014 book on Churchill, Johnson wrote that his predecessor was a hero but one who expressed “all sorts of views” during his political career.“As it happens, he generally changed with the times. He changed his view on India, and her capacity for independence; and whatever he may have said about Islam in the 1890s, he also built the Regent’s Park Mosque in the 1940s”, he wrote.“And above all – as so many have rightly pointed out – it is the height of lunacy to accuse him of racism, when he stood alone against a racist tyranny that without his resistance would have overwhelmed this country and the rest of Europe”.Labour and anti-racism campaigners promptly dismissed Johnson’s brief announcement in the article – with little detail – to set up a “cross-departmental commission” to look into inequalities in employment, health and other aspects of lifeShadow justice secretary David Lammy said that if Johnson were serious about wanting to address racial inequalities, he should implement the recommendations of the many reviews already conducted instead of setting up a new commission or inquiry.He said: “I made 35 specific recommendations in the Lammy review. Implement them. There are 110 recommendations in the Anjiolini review into deaths into police custody. Implement them. There are 30 recommendations in the Home Office review into the Windrush scandal”.“Implement them. Twenty six into Baroness McGregor’s review into workplace discrimination. Implement them. That’s what Boris has to do. And the Black Lives protests can stop and we can get on with dealing with the coronavirus”, he added.Johnson reiterated in the article his opposition to statues being pulled down, stating that he would “resist with every breath in my body” any attempt to remove Churchill’s statue in Parliament Square.He wrote: “It is not just that is wrong to destroy public property by violence. I am also extremely dubious about the growing campaign to edit or photoshop the entire cultural landscape”.“Would it not be better and more honest to ask our children to understand the context, to explain the mixture of good and bad in the career of Churchill and everyone else?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/churchill-changed-view-on-india-s-freedom-in-later-years-claims-pm-boris-johnson/story-5tcwbCBsgppEXoUSQZdtgL.html

The pilot remains missing.The F-15C Eagle from the 48th Fighter Wing was on a routine training mission from RAF Lakenheath when it crashed at 9:40 a.m. The cause of the crash wasn’t immediately clear.Britain’s coast guard located wreckage from the downed fighter, and recovery efforts were underway, the U.S. Air Force said in a statement.”The pilot is still missing, and search and rescue efforts continue,” the statement added.Coast guard officials said in a statement that they received reports the plane went down 74 nautical miles off Flamborough Head on the Yorkshire coast.A helicopter and lifeboats have been deployed.“Other vessels nearby are heading to the area,” the coast guard said in a statement.Lakenheath is a Royal Air Force base that hosts the U.S. Air Force’s 48th Fighter Wing, known as the Liberty Wing. The base is about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of London.The wing has more than 4,500 active-duty military members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pilot-of-us-air-force-jet-that-crashed-in-north-sea-is-dead/story-P7zpJXCWwhzIUHBKwE8ZTJ.html
15-06-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson’s new anti-racism commission triggers row||A brief announcement by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday of a commission into racism in the UK sparked a row with the opposition Labour and others asking him to implement recommendations of earlier reports instead of setting up a new one.Johnson announced the “cross-departmental commission” in an article in The Daily Telegraph, in which he wrote that though much has changed in the UK on issues of race, there is much more that needs to be done.Reiterating his opposition to pulling down statues of historical figures, including that of “hero” Winston Churchill, Johnson, who authored a biography of Churchill in 2014, wrote that the man whom many consider the ‘greatest Briton’ had expressed “all sorts of views”.“As it happens, he generally changed with the times. He changed his view on India, and her capacity for independence; and whatever he may have said about Islam in the 1890s, he also built the Regent’s Park Mosque in the 1940s”, he wrote.Labour dismissed the announcement of the new commission to look into inequalities in employment, health and other aspects of life.Shadow justice secretary David Lammy said that if Johnson were serious about wanting to address racial inequalities, he should implement the recommendations of the many reviews already conducted instead of setting up a new commission or inquiry.He said: “I made 35 specific recommendations in the Lammy review. Implement them. There are 110 recommendations in the Anjiolini review into deaths into police custody. Implement them.

15-06-2020||World||Supreme Court says gay, transgender workers protected by law||The Supreme Court ruled Monday that a landmark civil rights law protects gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination in employment, a resounding victory for LGBT rights from a conservative court.The court decided by a 6-3 vote that a key provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 known as Title VII that bars job discrimination because of sex, among other reasons, encompasses bias against LGBT workers.“An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the court. “Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.”The decision was a defeat not just for the employers, but also the Trump administration, which argued that the law’s plain wording compelled a ruling for the employers. Gorsuch, a conservative appointee of President Donald Trump, concluded the opposite.He was joined in the majority by Chief Justice John Roberts and the court’s four liberal members. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Trump’s other Supreme Court pick, dissented, along with Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas.“The Court tries to convince readers that it is merely enforcing the terms of the statute, but that is preposterous,” Alito wrote in the dissent. “Even as understood today, the concept of discrimination because of ‘sex’ is different from discrimination because of ‘sexual orientation’ or ‘gender identity.‘”Kavanaugh wrote in a separate dissent that the court was rewriting the law to include gender identity and sexual orientation, a job that belongs to Congress. Still, Kavanaugh said the decision represents an “important victory achieved today by gay and lesbian Americans.”The outcome is expected to have a big impact for the estimated 8.1 million LGBT workers across the country because most states don’t protect them from workplace discrimination. An estimated 11.3 million LGBT people live in the U.S., according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA law school.Gerald Bostock, a gay county government worker from Georgia whose lawsuit was one of three the Supreme Court decided Monday, said no should should have to be “fearful of losing their job because of who they are, who they love or how they identify. And the justices have now made sure that we won’t have to worry about that.”John Bursch, who argued the appeal from a Michigan funeral home owner against a fired transgender employee, said, “Americans must be able to rely on what the law says, and it is disappointing that a majority of the justices were unwilling to affirm that commonsense principle. Redefining ‘sex’ to mean ‘gender identity’ will create chaos and enormous unfairness for women and girls in athletics, women’s shelters, and many other contexts.”But Monday’s decision is not likely to be the court’s last word on a host of issues revolving around LGBT rights, Gorsuch noted.Lawsuits are pending over transgender athletes’ participation in school sporting events, and courts also are dealing with cases about sex-segregated bathrooms and locker rooms, a subject that the justices seemed concerned about during arguments in October. Employers who have religious objections to employing LGBT people also might be able to raise those claims in a different case, Gorsuch said.“But none of these other laws are before us; we have not had the benefit of adversarial testing about the meaning of their terms, and we do not prejudge any such question today,” he wrote.The cases were the court’s first on LGBT rights since J ustice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement and replacement by Kavanaugh. Kennedy was a voice for gay rights and the author of the landmark ruling in 2015 that made same-sex marriage legal throughout the United States. Kavanaugh generally is regarded as more conservative.The Trump administration had changed course from the Obama administration, which supported LGBT workers in their discrimination claims under Title VII.During the Obama years, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had changed its longstanding interpretation of civil rights law to include discrimination against LGBT people. The law prohibits discrimination because of sex, but has no specific protection for sexual orientation or gender identity.Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden, Obama’s vice president, praised the decision on Twitter as “another step in our march toward equality for all. The Supreme Court has confirmed the simple but profoundly American idea that every human being should be treated with respect.”In recent years, some lower courts have held that discrimination against LGBT people is a subset of sex discrimination, and thus prohibited by the federal law.Efforts by Congress to change the law to explicitly bar job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity have so far failed.The Supreme Court cases involved two gay men and a transgender woman who sued for employment discrimination after they lost their jobs.Aimee Stephens lost her job as a funeral director in the Detroit area after she revealed to her boss that she had struggled with gender most of her life and had, at long last, “decided to become the person that my mind already is.” Stephens told funeral home owner Thomas Rost that following a vacation, she would report to work wearing a conservative skirt suit or dress that Rost required for women who worked at his three funeral homes. Rost fired Stephens.The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, Ohio, ruled that the firing constituted sex discrimination under federal law.Stephens died last month. Donna Stephens, her wife of 20 years, said in a statement that she is “grateful for this victory to honor the legacy of Aimee, and to ensure people are treated fairly regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.”The federal appeals court in New York ruled in favor of a gay skydiving instructor who claimed he was fired because of his sexual orientation. The full 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 10-3 that it was abandoning its earlier holding that Title VII didn’t cover sexual orientation because “legal doctrine evolves.” The court held that “sexual orientation discrimination is motivated, at least in part, by sex and is thus a subset of sex discrimination.”That ruling was a victory for the relatives of Donald Zarda, who was fired in 2010 from a skydiving job in Central Islip, New York, that required him to strap himself tightly to clients so they could jump in tandem from an airplane. He tried to put a woman with whom he was jumping at ease by explaining that he was gay. The school fired Zarda after the woman’s boyfriend called to complain.Zarda died in a wingsuit accident in Switzerland in 2014.In a case from Georgia, the federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled against Bostock, a gay employee of Clayton County, in the Atlanta suburbs. Bostock claimed he was fired in 2013 because he is gay. The county argues that Bostock was let go because of the results of an audit of funds he managed.The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed Bostock’s claim in a three-page opinion that noted the court was bound by a 1979 decision that held “discharge for homosexuality is not prohibited by Title VII.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/supreme-court-says-gay-transgender-workers-protected-by-law/story-5otEXZRgB9iOUjfRBS9R3J.html
15-06-2020||World||US ‘outraged’ over Russia convicting American businessman for spying||The United States on Monday reacted with “outrage” to the sentencing of an American businessman by a Russian court to 16 years on charges of spying, at the end of a trial held in secret.“The United States is outraged by the decision of a Russian court today to convict US citizen Paul Whelan after a secret trial, with secret evidence, and without appropriate allowances for defense witnesses,” Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said in a statement.Pompeo went on to allege Whelan has bene treated poorly in Russian prison and demanded his “immediate release”.A Moscow city court has sent Whelan to a maximum security prison.Whelan’s twin brother David Whelan has said they will appeal the verdict. “The court’s decision merely completes the final piece of this broken judicial process.”“We had hoped that the court might show some independence but, in the end, Russian judges are political, not legal, entities,” the statement said. “We look to the U.S. government to immediately take steps to bring Paul home.”Whelan’s lawyer and brother have said he was arrested in a sting operation. The American businessman, who is in corporate security, was arrested from outside a Moscow hotel in December 2018. His lawyer has said he had been handed a thumb-drive, which had confidential information that he did not know about. Whelan is an ex-Marine and holds Canadian, British and Irish passports. There has been speculation in US media that Whelan was arrested for a swap in which Moscow would like to exchange him for Russians in US custody, which would be one of the two — Viktor Bout, a gun-runner who was arrested in Thailand in 2008 and extradited to America in 2010; and Konstantin Yaroshenko, a pilot arrested in 2010 for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine.There was a third candidate earlier, Maria Butina, who called herself a gun rights activist and had infiltrated conservative circles. She was arrested in July 2018, six months before Whelan, and convicted subsequently for acting as a foreign agent (which is different from spying). She was deported last October.Media reports indicate Russia may be interested in a swap involving Yaroshenko, who is serving a 20 year sentence. His American lawyer has asked for his release citing the Covid-19 pandemic because he has several medical conditions. Russian ambassador to the US wrote to Attorney General William Barr in April seeking “humane treatment” of the incarcerate pilot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-outraged-after-russia-convicts-american-businessman-for-spying/story-Nrc9WxoxrqUM25soZyflDL.html

Citing reports of heart complications, the FDA said the drugs pose a greater risk to patients than any potential benefits.The decades-old drugs, also prescribed for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, can cause heart rhythm problems, severely low blood pressure and muscle or nerve damage.The move means that shipments of the drugs obtained by the federal government will no longer be distributed to state and local health authorities. The drugs are still available for alternate uses, so U.S. doctors could still prescribe them for Covid-19 — a practice known as off-label prescribing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-revokes-emergency-use-of-malaria-drugs-vs-coronavirus/story-BJQMNZYUYcSzIhPBDBbvJK.html

It has been four days since the first infection was detected.The WHO is still waiting for China to share the genome sequence of the virus extracted from infected samples, which were picked up by Chinese scientists over the weekend from the Xinfadi market soon after it was shut down to the outside world.To a Reuters question whether China has shared the gene sequence with WHO, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said on Monday: “China has maintained close communication with the World Health Organisation. As for the specific question you mentioned, I don’t know the specific situation yet. Please inquire directly to the competent department.”Beijing has logged in as many as 79 new cases since June 11, the most significant flare-up in a major Chinese city that is home to China’s political and business elite.“The WHO has not visited the Xinfadi market in relation to this cluster of Covid-19, with the first confirmed cases on June 11,” the Organisation said in a statement to Hindustan Times on Monday, adding that it was receiving updates from the Chinese health authorities.Dozens of residential communities have been locked down, schools have been closed and emergency response levels are being gradually raised across the city’s districts after the rapidly spreading cluster infection emerged from the sprawling market.Beijing is said to be preparing to test at least 90,000 people connected to the market and living in its neighbourhood.The Xinfadi Agricultural Products Wholesale market, which also deals in meat and seafood, is located some 25 km away from the WHO office in Beijing.Until Monday evening, the WHO, the UN’s specialised agency for international public health, had only received briefings about the new and fast spreading cluster from Chinese health authorities – without any first-hand knowledge about a worrying infection that has resurfaced in Beijing – which had zero cases since April -- after a gap of 55 days.It was not immediately clear if Beijing is yet to give consent to the WHO, as per protocol, to send a team to the Xinfadi market in the southwest Fengtai district.The market was shuttered over the weekend and scientists from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, experts from its Beijing centre and the national health commission (NHC) have scoured the market, picked up samples and conducted preliminary tests.According to state media reports, the virus was detected on a salmon chopping board.The WHO did not answer HT’s query whether it had asked Chinese authorities to visit the market but said it was receiving regular updates from health authorities.“The information thus far has come from Chinese national and municipal health officials, in briefings and exchanges with the WHO office in China and updates sent via the International Health Regulations mechanism,” the statement said.“In our exchanges, the WHO has received a briefing on the preliminary investigation, offered support and technical assistance. Chinese health authorities have agreed to continue to exchange further information about the cluster and the investigations underway and planned,” the statement said.The organisation is yet to receive gene sequencing results.“The WHO encourages the sharing of this and other sequences on a publicly available website as soon as possible. We await more genetic sequencing to see how close this virus is to others. We have asked China for the genetic sequencing and to receive new data on the epidemic as the investigation unfolds; and our counterparts are committed to continuing to provide such data. The WHO is following up with Chinese officials for further detail,” the statement added.An Associated Press report released earlier this month said the WHO worked on minimal information during the beginning of the outbreak in China in December and January, alleging that Beijing was deliberately slow in sharing critical information.Both China and WHO denied it.The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has praised China for “setting a new standard for outbreak response” through swift and aggressive measures.While the pandemic rages globally, China has sharply brought down the infection numbers across the country with the government saying that the outbreak has been effectively controlled, until the virus reemerged in Beijing last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cluster-of-covid-19-in-chinese-capital-who-yet-to-visit-affected-site/story-0ZvDsQ4eWV3D3VWHg9dz8K.html

I was in the right place at right time, and incredibly lucky from that point of view. He came towards me walking briskly.”Martinez said the man being carried had injuries to his face, and Reuters journalists at the scene said he had been beaten in a skirmish with anti-racism protesters.Some people in the crowd shouted out that the assault victim was a member of the far-right.Reuters was not able to identify the victim or his political leanings. Police said they were aware of the incident and the photograph, but made no further comment when Reuters asked for details of the men’s identity and what happened.Protests have erupted across British cities and around the world after a black man, George Floyd, died in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25.In some cases they have sparked counter-demonstrations by people who do not agree with all of their aims and methods, and these have included people from far-right groups.British media identified the black man as Patrick Hutchinson, a personal trainer. On his social media account, he wrote: “We saved a life today”.Reuters spoke to the partner of Hutchinson’s best friend, who confirmed it was him. Hutchinson did not reply to calls to his mobile phone.He told British Channel 4 News on Sunday it was a “scary” scene. “It was pretty hectic, it was almost like a stampede.“...The guys went in there, they sort of put a little cordon around him to stop him receiving any more physical harm. His life was under threat.“So I just went under, scooped him up and put him on my shoulders and sort of started marching towards the police with him whilst all the guys were surrounding me and protecting me and the guy I had on my shoulder.”In a statement on Sunday police said 113 people had been arrested over the weekend and 23 officers were injured in the violence, none of them seriously.The reaction on social media to the picture and events it portrayed has been largely positive.“Amid all the ugliness, a beautiful moment of humanity,” wrote British journalist Piers Morgan in a Tweet accompanying the photograph.Martinez, a veteran photographer who is Reuters’ picture editor for the United Kingdom and Ireland, said the protests in London on Saturday had been fluid and unpredictable.After witnessing sporadic, minor clashes between demonstrators and police in Trafalgar Square, Martinez said he switched attention to nearby Waterloo Bridge, where several hundred anti-racism protesters had gathered.“They took over the whole of the bridge,” he said. “There was a traffic jam going from south to north, but the vibe was good - cars were honking and people were celebrating.”The mood quickly turned ugly when they encountered a group of counter-protesters and clashes broke out, Martinez said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-man-carries-injured-white-person-to-safety-at-london-protest/story-gfzhIABVlFOQ0RY6YuMSsK.html
15-06-2020||World||Covid-19: Europe’s borders reopen but long road for tourism to recover||Borders opened up across Europe on Monday after three months of coronavirus closures that began chaotically in March. But many restrictions persist, it’s unclear how keen Europeans will be to travel this summer and the continent is still closed to Americans, Asians and other international tourists.Border checks for most Europeans were dropped overnight in Germany, France and elsewhere, nearly two weeks after Italy opened its frontiers. The European Union’s 27 nations, as well as those in the Schengen passport-free travel area, which also includes a few non-EU nations such as Switzerland, aren’t expected to start opening to visitors from outside the continent until at least the beginning of next month, and possibly later.Announcing Monday’s reopening of borders and Paris restaurants, French President Emmanuel Macron said it’s time “to turn the page of the first act of the crisis” and “rediscover our taste for freedom.”But he warned: “This doesn’t mean the virus has disappeared and we can totally let down our guard. ... The summer of 2020 will be a summer unlike any other.”That caution is widespread after more than 182,000 virus-linked deaths in Europe. The region has had more than 2 million of the world’s 7.9 million confirmed infections, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.“We have got the pandemic under control, (but) the reopening of our frontiers is a critical moment,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said as he announced he was bringing forward Spain’s opening to European travelers by 10 days to June 21. “The threat is still real. The virus is still out there.”Even so, social distancing was in short supply as London’s Oxford Street shops reopened and Paris bistros like Café Des Anges welcomed back regular customers. Crowds jammed the entrance to London’s Niketown store despite efforts by employees to have an orderly line.“It’s very hard to get people who are sitting at the bar to respect social distancing,” said cafe manager Virgile Grunberg. “People have missed this, because they come in every morning before work, have a little coffee and a discussion, so of course it’s part of Paris.”The need to get Europe’s tourism industry up and running again is urgent, especially for Mediterranean nations like Spain, Italy and Greece as the economic fallout of the crisis mushrooms.“A lot will depend on whether people feel comfortable to travel and whether we can project Greece as a safe destination,” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis acknowledged.On Monday, Greece welcomed the first international flights whose passengers didn’t face compulsory COVID-19 tests to Athens and Thessaloniki. Direct international flights to regional Greek airports, including on its sun-kissed islands, will begin on July 1. Visitors will be subject to random virus testing.In a trial run, Spain on Monday allowed the first of thousands of Germans to fly to its Balearic Islands — waiving its 14-day quarantine. The idea is to test out best practices in the coronavirus era.“This pilot program will help us learn a lot for what lies ahead,” Sánchez said. “We want our country, which is already known as a world-class tourist destination, to be recognized as also a secure destination.”Martin Hofman was delighted as he boarded the first flight from Duesseldorf to the island of Mallorca — a destination that mainland Spaniards can’t even visit yet.His holiday couldn’t be postponed “and to stay in Germany was not an option for us,” he said. “We are totally happy that we can get out.”Europe’s reopening isn’t a repeat of the chaotic free-for-all in March, when panicked, uncoordinated border closures caused traffic jams that stretched for miles.Still, it’s a complicated, shifting patchwork of different rules, and not everyone is equally free to travel everywhere. Norway and Denmark, for example, are keeping their borders closed with Sweden, whose virus strategy avoided a lockdown but produced a relatively high per capita death rate. Other nations also have travel restrictions for Swedes.In an interview with state broadcaster SVT, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven rejected that idea that Sweden’s strategy had failed, citing a continuing decline in hospitalizations and fatalities. While the rate of new infections has increased, officials say that reflects a long-delayed increase in testing.German drivers queued up in long lines Monday to cross into Denmark, which is letting in German visitors but only those who booked accommodations for at least six nights.Britain, which left the EU in January but remains closely aligned with the bloc until the end of this year, only last week imposed a 14-day quarantine requirement for most arrivals, horrifying its tourism and aviation industries. As a result, France is asking people from Britain to self-quarantine for two weeks and several other nations are not letting British tourists in during the first wave of reopenings.With flights only gradually picking up, nervousness about new outbreaks abroad, uncertainty about social distancing at tourist venues and millions facing record unemployment or pay cuts, many Europeans may choose to vacation at home.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz are both planning to vacation in their homelands this year.The Dutch government said its citizens can now visit 16 European nations, but urged caution.“You can go abroad for your holiday again,” Foreign Minister Stef Blok said. “But it won’t be as carefree as before the corona crisis. The virus is still among us and the situation remains uncertain.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-europe-s-borders-reopen-but-long-road-for-tourism-to-recover/story-UPACkkbl5sZSfKUpAFTRWI.html
15-06-2020||World||‘Can’t forget those at home’: UK’s loneliness minister on writing letters||The UK’s minister for loneliness - described as the world’s first such minister - on Monday asked people to consider writing to the lonely amid the raging coronavirus pandemic.The portfolio was created by former Prime Minister Theresa May, when she appointed the first such minister in January 2018. The current minister is Diana Barran, a junior minister in the department of gigital, media, culture and sport.“Writing letters might be a slightly forgotten art but it’s more important than ever to connect with people, and putting pen to paper is an excellent way of making sure our friends, family and neighbours know we’re thinking about them,” said Barran.“The last few months have brought loneliness to the forefront of our minds. We all have a role in being kind and looking out for each other, and as some of us begin to regain some normality we cannot forget those who may need to stay at home for longer and could be at risk of feeling lonely,” she added.The initiative is part of ‘Loneliness Awareness Week’ (June 15-19). Letters in the week will have a ‘Let’s Talk Loneliness’ postmark. According to Royal Mail, nearly three quarters of people (74%) feel that writing letters has positive mental health benefits. Posting a letter to a friend who is still shielding. Please let me know about the letters you have sent or received during #lockdown and send another during #lonelinessawarenessweek #letstalkloneliness 📩📮📝 pic.twitter.com/BytWkCRPJ5David Gold of Royal Mail said: “Handwritten correspondence is a very powerful way of connecting and showing someone close that you care; particularly during these difficult and sometimes isolating times”.A government spokesperson said after creating the first minister for loneliness, the world’s first government loneliness strategy was published in October 2018, containing 60 commitments from nine departments.The first government fund dedicated to reducing loneliness is worth £11.5 million, supporting 126 projects across England. A #LetsTalkLoneliness campaign was also launched in June 2019 to help raise awareness and tackle stigma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-t-forget-those-at-home-uk-s-loneliness-minister-on-writing-letters/story-s998sbFWK6BSPyuGgPwR9K.html

They will be vital in helping kick-start the economy as we recover from the virus”, he added. The shops have re-opened in England, not elsewhere in the UK.The shops need to ensure they are ‘Covid-19 secure’ before opening, which includes barriers for queues outside, one-way routes inside shops and several posters inside to remind people to maintain at least 2 metre-distance from others.Officials said the non-essential retail sector employs 1.3 million people, accounting for £46.6 billion to British economy, which has seen its GDP plummet 20 per cent in April. The shops can re-open after meeting the ‘five tests’ set out by the Prime Minister Johnson.The five tests are: That the National Health Service can continue to cope; that the daily death rate falls sustainably and consistently; that the rate of infection is falling; that the operational challenges have been met; and most importantly, that there is no risk of a second peak.On Sunday, the UK recorded its lowest daily death toll of 36 since the lockdown began on March 23, besides dwindling number of news cases, encouraging the government to gradually re-open parts of the economy.However, London mayor Sadiq Khan joining experts to caution the people that the lockdown has not been lifted: “The virus is still out there…Stay at home as much as possible and avoid public transport”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-lockdown-long-queues-as-shops-re-open-in-england-after-more-than-2-months/story-xLPZ3MGqNpRPFUz6XNbN3I.html

Those summits initially helped to improve their countries’ ties significantly, before their relations became strained again after the breakdown of a second Kim-Trump summit in Vietnam in early 2019.North Korea has recently unleashed a slew of harsh rhetoric against South Korea, accusing it of failing to prevent activists from launching propaganda leaflets across their border. In an apparent bid to soothe North Korea, Moon’s government vowed to ban civilian leafleting campaign. North Korea has said the South Korean response lacks sincerity.Some observers say North Korea is frustrated because Seoul has failed to break away from Washington and revive stalled joint economic projects held back by U.S.-led sanctions. They also speculate North Korea initially thought Moon would help it win badly needed sanctions relief but got upset after Kim returned home empty handed from the 2019 summit with Trump.Moon said the two Koreas must take the initiative in finding a breakthrough, calling the nations “the masters of the destiny for the Korean Peninsula.” He said his government will keep striving to promote dialogue with North Korea.Monday marks the 20th anniversary of the first-ever inter-Korean summit — between Kim’s late father Kim Jong Il and South Korea’s then-President Kim Dae-jung in Pyongyang.The Koreas remain split along the world’s most heavily fortified border since they were divided into a U.S.-backed South Korea and a Soviet-controlled North Korea at the end of the World War II in 1945.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-s-leader-calls-on-north-to-stop-raising-tensions/story-D57UR1usAY5BA3avH3j1WO.html

15-06-2020||World||Hong Kong security laws may not be retroactive, says China||Sweeping new national security laws being imposed on Hong Kong might not be retroactive, a Chinese official said, potentially limiting the scope of controversial legislation that’s currently being drafted in Beijing.Deng Zhonghua, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, made the comments Monday at an event in the mainland border city of Shenzhen. The conference was organized by the Chinese Association of Hong Kong & Macau Studies and was attended by several officials responsible for affairs in the former British colony.“It needs to be clarified that, even though there are differences in the Hong Kong and mainland legal systems, the principles used in the mainland with regard to criminal laws are not fundamentally different from those in Hong Kong,” Deng said. “They all include principles such as the laws will not be applied retrospectively, presumption of innocence, suspects and defendants will have right to defense.”Deng added: “All these principles can be stipulated in this legislation.”The Chinese government and its appointed leaders in Hong Kong have been seeking to reassure local residents, foreign officials and overseas investors about the looming legislation. Pro-democracy activists and their supporters have expressed alarm about the security laws, which would criminalize the harshest criticism of Beijing after a year of unprecedented and often violent anti-government protests.Organizations ranging from business chambers to human rights groups have criticized Beijing’s move to bypass Hong Kong’s legislature and impose laws banning subversion, secession and foreign interference. Opponents say the push would undermine the freedoms promised to Hong Kong before its return to Chinese rule in 1997 and erode the city’s appeal as a global financial hub.For months last year, protesters chanted “Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times!” in marches that drew more than a million people. One band of radicals broke into the Legislative Council on the anniversary of the handover, ransacking the chamber and defacing the city’s emblem. Some high-profile activists traveled to Washington to advocate for legislation that would punish Beijing for its crackdown.Deng’s comments echo remarks by Hong Kong Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng, who said in a blog post Sunday that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region’s Common Law legal system had much in common with China’s system.“There are a number of commonalities between the civil and common law systems respectively in the Mainland and the HKSAR, such as retrospectivity, presumption of innocence, burden of proof and standard of proof, legal certainty, etc.,” she wrote.At the same time, she said it was “impracticable and unreasonable to expect that everything in a national law, the National Security Law, will be exactly as what a statute in the HKSAR common law jurisdiction would be like.”‘Rare Circumstances’In his remarks, Deng referred to Beijing’s plan to establish new national security enforcement mechanisms as part of the impending legislation, a move that has raised fears China would allow its security forces a free hand to operate openly in Hong Kong for the first time.Deng said that Hong Kong should remain in charge of most enforcement and legal processes surrounding the security legislation, but mentioned that China “should also reserve the right to have jurisdiction over cases that seriously endanger national security under very rare circumstances.” That reference could raise the specter of extradition -- an issue that sparked last year’s protests -- or trials by Communist Party-controlled judges.“For this law to be effective, the key is the establishment of strong enforcement mechanisms, including setting up agencies to safeguard national security and to grant them necessary enforcement powers,” Deng said. “Of course, there are only few cases where China will have jurisdiction over. It will not replace the responsibilities of Hong Kong’s relevant departments, nor would it affect judicial independence and final adjudication that Hong Kong enjoys under the Basic Law.”Proposed AgendaIt is not yet clear when China will finalize its plans for the new security laws.The National People’s Congress Standing Committee, the top decision-making body of China’s rubber-stamp legislature that had originally unveiled Beijing’s plan to impose the new laws, will hold its bi-monthly session from Thursday to Saturday. The Hong Kong national security legislation is not on a proposed agenda published last week.The Hong Kong security issue could be added in a last-minute change to the agenda, or the committee could also hold an interim meeting if there’s a special need to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-security-laws-may-not-be-retroactive-says-china/story-JMH6JkXqeEzpqtfGAmYqcJ.html

These fashion stores are sitting on around £15 billion of unsold stock, the reports further said.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, keen to see the UK economy start recovering from a coronavirus hammering, said on Sunday that people should ‘shop with confidence’.“I think people should shop and shop with confidence but they should of course observe the rules on social distancing and do it safely as well,” he said after touring the Westfield Stratford City shopping mall in east London.“I know people are anxious,” finance minister Rishi Sunak said on Sunday as he encouraged shopping to help kickstart an economy seeing unprecedented declines.“It’s a slightly different experience... but it is a safe environment and we should all be able to go out knowing that we should be able to shop in confidence,” he told Sky News. The stores have been closed since March 23 when Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a lockdown to stem the spread of the virus. While outdoor markets and car showrooms reopened on June 1, Monday will be the big return to business for retailers.It only applies to England, with stores in Scotland and Wales waiting for guidance from their devolved administrations on when they can resume trading. Non-essential stores in Northern Ireland reopened on Friday.Getting shoppers spending again is key to Britain’s recovery after official data on Friday showed the economy shrank by a quarter over March and April.The British Retail Consortium reckons the lockdown has cost non-food stores $2.3 billion a week in lost revenues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-s-shops-reopen-today-as-lockdown-eases-massive-discounts-on-offer-to-offload-15-billion-unsold-stock/story-FFdwtMlgMpRv3S1hajLBBN.html

15-06-2020||World||2 Sydney statues of British explorer James Cook vandalised||An Australian state government leader said on Monday she was considering tougher laws to protect monuments after two statues of British explorer James Cook were vandalised in Sydney.Two women were charged with defacing a statue with spray paint in downtown Hyde Park over Saturday night. Another statue was discovered spray painted in the eastern suburb of Randwick on Sunday morning in an unrelated attack, police said.Cities around the world are taking steps to remove statues that represent cultural or racial oppression.New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she would consider toughening laws to deter future vandalism.“I wish it didn’t come to this and I want to stress that it’s only a very, very small percentage of the population that’s engaging in this activity, the vast majority of us don’t condone it, we think it’s disrespectful, it’s un-Australian,” she told reporters.Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week apologised for words he used last week to reject calls for his Sydney electoral district of Cook to be renamed.Cook came ashore in the district in 1770 in what was to become the site of the first British colony in Australia.Morrison apologised for saying Australia has been colonised without slavery after critics pointed out that tens of thousands of South Pacific islanders had been forced to labour on Australian sugar cane plantations in the 19th century and Australian indigenous people had been forced to work for wages that were never paid.A part-time employee of the minor Greens party, Xiaoran Shi, 28, and her alleged accomplice Charmaine Morrison-Mills, 27, were released on bail from a Sydney court on Sunday on charges of damaging property and possessing a graffiti implement over the Hyde Park statue.Greens state lawmaker David Shoebridge, for whom Shi works, said he was aware of the allegations.“They were not engaged in employment at the time of the incident which occurred well outside of work hours,” Shoebridge said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-sydney-statues-of-british-explorer-james-cook-vandalised/story-1rcSuZUTEodMl49Ti8nPzJ.html
15-06-2020||World||Tokyo sees most coronavirus cases since May 5 as it eases restrictions||Tokyo disclosed 47 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, the highest since May 5, as the capital eases restrictions and readies to fully reopen the economy.Thirty-two of the cases were traced to nightclubs and bars, a spokeswoman for the Tokyo Metropolitan Government said by phone, with 18 of them coming from a single business establishment in Shinjuku, which houses the city’s most well-known entertainment and red-light district. It is yet to be determined where 10 other people contracted the virus. The surge was the result of more proactive testing, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told reporters Sunday.The jump comes as the Tokyo government is planning to lift all business restrictions on Friday, which would allow nightclubs and live music venues to reopen. While many firms have voluntarily complied with requests to close, with authorities lacking the ability to enforce requests, some establishments continued to operate during the pandemic.The increase also comes days after the capital entered its final reopening phase and lifted the “Tokyo Alert,” which was issued to urge greater vigilance amid a rebound in cases after a state of emergency ended May 25.“I’d like to deal with it positively,” said Yasutoshi Nishimura, economy and fiscal policy minister, about the case spike at a press conference Sunday, with businesses being cooperative and measures taken to prevent a second wave of infections.On Saturday, Nishimura announced a new policy at nightclubs and bars to contain the spread, according to Nikkei. It reported the policy will include customers being separated from each other and their contact information being checked.As Japan’s economy gradually restarts, Nishimura told NHK on Sunday morning that the government will push for digitalization and support employment with subsidies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tokyo-sees-most-coronavirus-cases-since-may-5-as-it-eases-restrictions/story-9abfHbatWiTogXl7TqL0pK.html
15-06-2020||World||Deaths of black men in Georgia, California prompt protests||A makeshift memorial popped up Sunday at a fast-food restaurant where a black man was fatally shot by a white Atlanta police officer, one of the latest deaths of black men that have ignited a new wave of anti-racism protests across the country.Demonstrations also erupted over the weekend in Palmdale, California, where hundreds demanded an investigation into the death of Robert Fuller, 24, a black man found hanging from a tree earlier Wednesday near city hall.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageEarly Sunday, Atlanta police announced that an officer, Garrett Rolfe, had been fired following the fatal shooting of Rayshard Brooks, 27, on Friday night, and another officer, Devin Brosnan, had been placed on administrative duty. On Saturday, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms had called for the immediate firing of the officer who opened fire on Brooks and announced that she had accepted the resignation of Police Chief Erika Shields.“I do not believe that this was a justified use of deadly force,” Bottoms said.Roughly 150 protesters marched outside the Wendy’s restaurant outside where Brooks was shot, reigniting demonstrations that had largely simmered in the Georgia capital nearly three weeks after George Floyd, another black man, died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee to his neck. Both Rolfe and Brosnan are white.The Wendy’s was set aflame at one point Saturday night, although the fire was out before midnight. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said that Brooks, who was seen on body camera video sleeping in a car blocking the Wendy’s drive thru, failed a sobriety test and was shot in a struggle over a police Taser.Atlanta police said Sunday that 36 people had been arrested in connection with the protests, but gave no further details.In California, authorities said Fuller’s death appeared to be a suicide, but an autopsy was planned. The city said there were no outdoor cameras that could have recorded what happened.Fuller’s death has brought to light the death of another black man found hanging from a tree on May 31 in Victorville, a desert city 45 miles (72 kilometers) east of Palmdale. A sheriff’s spokeswoman, Jodi Miller, told Victor Valley News foul play was not suspected in 38-year-old Malcolm Harsch’s death but the man’s family said they were concerned it will be ruled a suicide to avoid further attention.Meanwhile, the rapidly unfolding movement to take down Confederate statues in the U.S. grew over the weekend. In Richmond, Virginia, a police SUV drove up on a curb and struck multiple protesters who were blocking the vehicle’s path during a demonstration Saturday night at the Robert E. Lee statue, which has become a gathering place for racial justice demonstrations.The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports that no one appeared to be seriously injured. In messages posted on Twitter early Sunday morning, the Richmond Police Department said police are investigating the incident, including what it called “a possible assault” on an officer who was inside the vehicle. The department said it is also investigating reports on social media “that a person in the crowd may have been struck by the vehicle.” Spokespersons for the department did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Sunday morning.In Philadelphia, a group of about 100 people, some carrying guns and baseball bats, gathered around a statue of Christopher Columbus in Philadelphia on Saturday, saying they intended to protect it from vandals amid recent protests.“It would be over my dead body before they got to this statue,” Anthony Ruggiero, 41, told The Philadelphia Inquirer. “This is a part of history.” Mayor Jim Kenney condemned the “groups of armed individuals ‘protecting’” the statue in a Twitter post on Sunday.Meanwhile, three people were charged in the vandalism of a Christopher Columbus statue in Providence, Rhode Island.Protesters in New Orleans tore down a bust of a slave owner Saturday who left part of his fortune to New Orleans’ schools and then took the remains to the Mississippi River and rolled it down the banks into the water.And in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, the Cherokee Nation’s principal chief watched as two Confederate monuments were removed that were placed in its tribal headquarters nearly a century ago by the Daughters of the Confederacy.Also Saturday, members of the Clemson University football team led hundreds of demonstrators on the school’s campus in South Carolina. The march came a day after Clemson trustees voted to rename its honors college, stripping from the program the name of former vice president and slavery proponent John C. Calhoun.European protesters sought to show solidarity with their American counterparts and to confront bias in their own countries on Sunday. The demonstrations also posed a challenge to policies intended to limit crowds to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deaths-of-black-men-in-georgia-california-prompt-protests/story-lNDNDLGxlclh4bYz6pMMmL.html

A total of 743 healthy people ages 18 to 59 either received shots on two schedules or a placebo. More data will be uncovered from another group in the trial that received shots on a 28-day interval. Sinovac plans to publish its results in academic journals, according to a company spokesperson.Using a killed version of the coronavirus, Sinovac’s vaccine is among five Chinese experimental shots that have reached the crucial final stage of human testing before they can be approved for public use. The company announced a partnership this month with Instituto Butantan to conduct its phase III trial in Brazil, where the novel pathogen has caused the second-largest outbreak in a pandemic that so far infected more than 7.7 million people.Since lockdowns and social-distancing measures have helped to keep infection rates low in many countries, some of the world’s leading vaccine efforts are seeking to conduct phase III trial in active outbreaks to evaluate the effectiveness of their shots.Authorities in Brazil have approved the vaccine co-developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc to carry out late stage trials there, while Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna Inc is set to go into phase III trials in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/90-of-people-given-vaccine-by-sinovac-show-promising-results/story-00KjZxzwe3HOu7bVfO1jRM.html

We recovered Rs 2,100 as a fine on the spot from Nirale,” he said.The fine comprised Rs 1,100 for not maintaining social distance and Rs 1,000 for not wearing masks, Gangrade said.Indore has a total of 4,069 Covid-19 cases currently and 174 people have died of the infection. Madhya Pradesh on Monday touched 10,935 with 133 new coronavirus cases being detected in the last 24 hours, including 40 in capital Bhopal.With six people succumbing to the infection, the Covid-19 death toll in the state touched 465, the state health department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indore-groom-travels-with-12-in-single-vehicle-slapped-with-fine-of-rs-2-100/story-RFyEnxiMFo8KwQfxSlmJ9L.html

School education minister Varsha Gaikwad was among those who attended it. The move comes days after the Centre announced a three-phase plan to lift stringent restrictions imposed over two months ago to stop the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Centre has said in the second phase, it plans to reopen all educational institutes including schools and colleges after holding discussions with states and Union Territories.“Though in some areas, schools cannot be opened, the process of teaching cannot be stopped. The use of digital technology to reach out to students should be adopted,” a government circular said.Gaikwad said the government has stipulated certain hours of online teaching per week for students from Class 2 onwards and that there were demands for reopening all schools from August.In Tripura, the state government has formed a committee to examine the timings and modalities of re-opening educational institutions. “In the 32-member committee, we have members from different fields, including the education department officials. Six parents will be on the committee as invited members. We will examine the timing for re-opening of all the educational institutions,” education minister Ratan Lal Nath said.The Uttarakhand government has directed students to submit health certificates saying they have suffered from influenza-like illnesses over 14-days before taking board examination. The students will have to reach examination halls an hour early to ensure social distancing norms and carry personal sanitisers. The Uttarakhand government released the date sheet for the remaining board exams from June 22-25. R K Kunwar, the state’s school education department director, said the number of examination rooms has been doubled to ensure social distancing. “Students with a fever will be able to write their papers in separate rooms.”In Rajasthan, the state education board has asked school authorities to have sanitisers in every examination room and have students reach there at least an hour before the start of the exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-plan-reopening-of-schools-colleges/story-szkUhbO6nUnbntBwlVfPRI.html
15-06-2020||India||Telangana caps price of testing, treatment||HyderabadA day after announcing that private labs will be allowed to test for Covid-19 and corporate hospitals, permitted to treat Covid-19 patients, the Telangana government on Monday fixed a cap on the cost of diagnostic tests and treatment.Telangana has joined the list of states that have instituted pricecaps on treatment for the coronavirus disease in private hospitals. State health minister Eatala Rajender told reporters that the private labs authorised by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in the state will not charge more than Rs 2,200 for the tests, although he recommended that they avoid testing asymptomatic individuals. Similarly, the charges in private hospitals cannot exceed Rs 4,000 a day in normal wards, Rs 7,500 in Intensive Care Units (ICU) without ventilator and Rs 9,000 with ventilator support, he added.However, private hospitals would be permitted to collect additional charges for anti-viral drugs when the patients are on ventilator. Some anti-viral injections could cost up to Rs 50,000, the minister explained.Rajendar said tests will be done as per ICMR guidelines. And everyone who tests positive need not be hospitalised ; those with mild infections can stay in home quarantine, he added. On Sunday, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said that in the following 10 days, the health department would conduct tests on 50,000 people in 30 assembly constituencies in and around the capital city.As of Sunday, Telangana had 4974 cases of which 2312 are active; thus far, 185 people in the state have lost their lives to the viral disease. The minister said the health department is establishing a link between private health care establishments and the government for sharing of information related to number of tests, positive and negative cases and number of persons who are admitted at private hospitals.“The private hospitals will have to upload the information about the tests and treatment on the health department portal,” he said.Rajendar said the government would not take up rapid testing but continue with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Mass testing will be done in several parts of Hyderabad and other containment zones in the state which reported high number of cases.Laboratories in the state have the capacity to conduct 4,000 tests a day; thus far, ICMR has approved nine public and 17 private labs in the state to conduct tests. The department will do surveillance on each household in Hyderabad, to prevent the spread of the deadly disease, Rajendar said, adding that there are no plans to reimpose lockdown restrictions in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-caps-price-of-testing-treatment/story-2alEn6IVWFhqSfceorxvTN.html

Kandhamal district, which had reported 89 coronavirus cases till Sunday, added 48 new cases taking the total to 136. The steep rise came even as the state imposed a weekend shutdown in 11 of its districts that account for around 80 per cent of the total cases. It even imposed stricter lockdown norms in the Covid-19 epicentre of Ganjam district, where all business activity or vehicular movement was stopped after 12 o’clock during the day.Health department officials said with June and July likely to be crucial for tackling the coronavirus pandemic, accredited social health activists and auxiliary nursing midwife workers in Odisha will conduct a door-to-door survey from June 16.“The ASHA and ANM workers will visit each and every house in villages and slums in urban areas to identify people with Covid-19 symptoms. This campaign will continue till July 31,” said National Health Mission director Shalini Pandit.She said that only symptomatic people and close contacts of positive cases will be tested in accordance with ICMR guidelines. “Earlier when asymptomatic people were being tested, one among 200 of them was found to be infected. Now, one in every 20 symptomatic cases is testing positive for the virus,” she said.Pandit, however, said despite rising Covid-19 cases, positivity rate per lakh population in Odisha is 9.3 per cent compared to 88 per cent in Maharashtra and 205 per cent in Delhi. Odisha has also posted 2,708 recoveries, around 67 per cent of the total cases that is comparable to states like Rajasthan and union territories like Andaman and Nicobar islands.“We have so far conducted 2 lakh tests. Tests per million in the state is higher than the India average. The death rate of 0.3 per cent in Odisha has also remained low compared to 6.6. per cent in Delhi and India’s average of 0.7 per cent,” she said.“There has been a rise in positive cases across India after easing of lockdown restrictions. Doctors say cases will continue to rise in the next four to six weeks. Now, the onus is on the people to abide by the Covid-19 guidelines to keep the virus at bay,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-start-door-to-door-survey-for-covid-19-symptoms-as-cases-cross-4000-mark/story-1PcdOKVhdIrNTZvi6YaCHI.html

Nayak allegedly helped the businesses of Seashore by building a relationship with top IAS and IPS officers, journalists and senior politicians of the ruling BJD.Nayak was questioned for ‘certain clarifications’, CBI sources said.Seashore is one of the 44 companies being probed by the CBI since May 2014 following a Supreme Court order. The company reportedly raised around Rs 578 crore from gullible people offering 36 per cent interest per annum to the investors on their deposits.Nayak was first arrested in 2014 soon after CBI took over the case and the diaries seized from his house allegedly revealed that he had paid off several politicians, IAS and IPS officers on behalf of Seashore. Following the seizure, CBI had interrogated four IPS officers of Odisha between 2014 and 2016. Nayak later got bail from the Orissa High Court in August 2017.Seashore Group chief Prashant Dash who was also arrested, is now out on bail.Though opposition BJP and Congress had made an issue of the chit fund scam in 2014 polls, it went off the radar in the 2019 elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-two-year-gap-cbi-turns-focus-back-on-odisha-chit-fund-scam/story-lJhBvo443EkaBjpFDABhWI.html

The railway ministry has sought additional demand from states for ferrying remaining migrants back.“Only a few migrants are left now as most have reached home. We will continue to coordinate with state governments to send the remaining migrants back. We had asked state governments to send us their demand of remaining trains on June 3 and we received a demand for 171 Shramik Special trains from various states…We ended up running 222 Shramik Special trains till June 14. After the Supreme Court’s order we have again sought their need from the state governments to meet the additional demand,” Yadav said.As of now, a total of 63 more Shramik Special Trains have been demanded by various states following the Chairman of Railway Board’s letter to the states. A total of seven states; Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Gujarat and Jammu & Kashmir have sought the trains to ferry remaining migrants, according to the railway ministry.Speaking on deployment of Covid Coaches amid rising cases and demand by some state governments, Yadav said the Covid isolation coaches are meant to be used when the health infrastructure of various states gets exhausted due to the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases across the country.Suspected and confirmed Covid-19 patients will be kept in separate Covid Coaches wherever they are allocated as per the guidelines issued by the health ministry, he said. The Railways, has so far received a demand for coaches from Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and the Delhi government. The rest of the deployment will be done as and when states demand them, he added. The isolation coaches will be under the complete care of the chief medical officer of the state government, in the states where they will be deployed.The Railway Board chairman said it is more suitable to use non-AC coaches for isolation purposes of suspected or confirmed Covid-19 patients. For cooling, wherever required the Railways will provide roof insulation in the coaches, he added.For national capital Delhi, at least 50 coaches with around 800 beds have already been stationed at Shakur Basti railway station. “We have earmarked 500 coaches for Delhi and we are jointly working with the Delhi government to finalise locations. A joint team is working on it.

Earlier, it was limited to just Maharashtra.People from the two states, Delhi and Tamil Nadu, will have to undergo institutional quarantine for a period of three days followed by 11 days of home quarantine, while those from Maharashtra will have to undergo compulsory one week institutional quarantine followed by one week of home quarantine. For people coming from states other than these three, it is two weeks of home quarantine.This and several other decisions were taken at a review meeting chaired by chief minister BS Yediyurappa, following concerns over increase in Covid-19 cases in the state.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Karnataka CM pointed out that of the 7,000 Covid-19 positive cases registered in the state till Sunday evening 4,386 were returnees from Maharashtra and an additional 1,340 were those in contact with them. Those who had come from overseas, only 216 were tested Covid-19 positive.“Transmission is not happening because of movement within the state but because of people returning from other states and therefore we have to take these measures to contain it,” he added.Yediyurappa also claimed that the state was doing significantly better than the national average. He said while the state’s mortality rate was 1.2 per cent, the national average was 2.8 per cent. He also said that Karnataka had a recovery rate of 56.6 per cent against the national average of 51 per cent.Responding to a question on reimposition of the lockdown, the CM said if anything he would appeal to the PM for further relaxations.

An official bulletin from the state legislature said the session would commence at 9.55 am with the joint address of the state legislative assembly and legislative council by Governor Biswabhushan Harichandan through video conferencing from Darbar Hall of Raj Bhavan, keeping in view the Covid-19 pandemic in the state.As per the schedule, the session will be held only for two days, but a final call will be taken by the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) of the state legislature which will meet soon after the Governor’s address.Later in the afternoon, finance minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy will present the state budget in the Assembly. On June 17, there will be a short debate on the thanksgiving motion for the Governor’s address, followed by passage of appropriation bill.On June 18, the appropriation bill would be introduced in the legislative Council and on June 19, the election for four vacant Rajya Sabha seats will be held. “If the BAC decides to extend the session, it might continue till Saturday. Otherwise, both the Houses would be adjourned sine die immediately after the passage of appropriation bill,” an official in the state legislature familiar with the development said.The assembly authorities have made all the arrangements for the holding of the budget session. Seating arrangements have been changed to maintain physical distance in the assembly and council, the official said.While a select group of media persons would be allowed only into the press gallery, no permission would be given for news channels to install their cameras for live telecast of the session. ““No visitors would be allowed into the assembly premises,” the bulletin said.The budget session of the state assembly was originally scheduled to be held in the last week of March, but was cancelled following the sudden announcement of lockdown by the Centre to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Since the financial year 2020-21 was to commence from April 1, the state had no option but to go in for promulgation of ordinance on March 30 to draw funds from the state’s consolidated fund for three months.As the three-month period will expire by June 30, the state is compelled to hold the assembly session to pass the budget for the next nine months and also approve the expenditure incurred for the first three months of the financial year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/under-shadow-of-covid-19-andhra-to-hold-short-budget-session-from-tuesday/story-Dw1zaCCKeVduI3nL8EePsI.html
15-06-2020||India||Onus on Nepal govt to create ‘positive atmosphere’ for talks on border row||The onus is on the KP Sharma Oli government in Nepal to create a “positive and conducive atmosphere” for talks to resolve the border row over the Kalapani-Lipulekh region, people familiar with developments said on Monday.The Indian side has repeatedly conveyed its readiness to discuss the issue, with the latest offer for talks between foreign secretaries of the two sides being made around the time the Nepal government tabled a constitutional amendment in Parliament on May 31 to give legal backing to the country’s new map, the people said on condition of anonymity.The Indian side didn’t receive any response to these overtures and it is now up to the government of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to create the positive environment needed for talks, the people said.“As recently as when the [constitutional amendment] bill was being tabled in [Nepal’s] Parliament and before that, India offered a phone call and a video-conference between the foreign secretaries and visits of the foreign secretaries. However, the Nepalese side didn’t respond to the offer and went ahead with passing the bill,” one of the people cited above said.“The onus is now on them to create a positive and conducive atmosphere for talks,” the person added.The people said Nepal’s unilateral action of issuing a new map that includes Indian territory has created a difficult situation and “pre-judged the outcome of any talks”. It also wasn’t clear why Oli or his government hadn’t told the Nepalese people or Parliament about the Indian offers for talks, they said.Nepalese officials have said they made three offers for talks to India between last November and May but got no response.The border row erupted last month after India opened an 80-km road to Lipulekh on the border with the Tibet Autonomous Region to facilitate pilgrims going to Kailash Mansarovar.Nepal lodged a strong protest and the government issued a new map that showed Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepalese territory. A constitutional amendment to give legal backing to the map was passed by the lower house of Nepal’s Parlaiment last week and is set to be taken up by the upper house this week.The people said almost 98% of the 1,750-km land and riverine border between India and Nepal has been delineated and differences remain only in the Kalapani sector in Uttarakhand and Susta sector in Bihar. Nepal’s “shifting” claims are contrary to the Treaty of Sugauli signed in 1815 by Nepal and the British, a ruling by the British governor general in 1817, and Nepal’s boundary treaty with China of 1961 and protocols signed by these two countries in 1963 and 1979, they added.“Their new map is not based on facts and evidence. The Nepal governemnt decided to form an expert team to find and collect evidence to establish its ownership in Kalapani up to Limpiyadhura and in Susta area after publishing the map and passing the bill in the lower house,” the person cited above said.Describing Nepal’s new map as a “tool for political gains”, the person added: “The Nepal government’s unilateral act of updating the map and the hasty effort to amend the constitution in Parliament reflect the intention of Prime Minister Oli and his government to politicise the boundary issue.“These actions do not reflect any seriousness on their part to resolve the issue through dialogue, and these actions are myopic and self-serving to further a limited political agenda.”Despite the border row, India remains committed to cooperating with Nepal on key humanitarian and connectivity projects, including rail links, and on the Covid-19 crisis, the people said. So far, India has provided medicines and equipment worth more than Rs 4.5 crore to Nepal to fight the Coronavirus, they said.The people also dismissed Oli’s repeated comments that Covid-19 was being spread in Nepal by people coming from India, describing them as “false and distorted”. Only a small portion of the 8 million Nepalese citizens living in India had returned home, they said. They noted that even as the constitutional amendment regarding the map was being discussed in Parliament, there were protests in Kathmandu over the Oli government’s handling of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/onus-on-nepal-govt-to-create-positive-atmosphere-for-talks-on-border-row-report/story-WcSIAAD43yjERpRwVOMcMI.html

I had appealed to them not to come but can I turn away people who have come to a function?”An official attached to Arasikere police station who did not want to be identified, said, “A case has been registered following a complaint by the Tehisldar. We are trying to get details and will be able to comment only after we have all the facts.”This is the second VIP wedding during the pandemic which has attracted criticism for failing to adhere to disaster control norms.

The airport commenced its domestic flight operations from May 25, with restrictions from the state government to handle 25 departures and 25 arrivals.

This was done as a precautionary step to avoid the spread of Covid-19 to and from other states. The 25 departure flights mostly operated to places like Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Varanasi, Kochi, Gorakhpur, Jaipur, Patna and Hyderabad. “The move will see an increase in the sectors that we are currently handling. We are glad about the new progress that has come in favour of CSMIA, and we continue to relentlessly work towards ensuring the safety of our passengers and smooth functioning at the airport,” a MIAL spokesperson said. The airport received permission to extend its operations from 50 to 100 flight movements on Monday before which the airlines had already scheduled their flights according to the restrictions. “The airport operator has alerted all the airlines about the development and a revised scheduled of flights that will be operated on Tuesday will be made.

Some top leaders of the TMC refused to comment saying that only O’Brien can comment as he had shared the picture.The picture showed some people carrying relief material on a boat after Cyclone Amphan. A Kolkata-based organization, however, said that the relief material was sent by them and they had shared the pictures with O’Brien.On May 26, the CPI(M)’s West Bengal committee first shared the picture saying that ‘our comrades’ have started relief and restoration work.“#Amphan has caused devastating damage in WB midst of a grim struggle combating the #Covid-19. Our comrades have started relief and rehabilitation work. These photos are from Hasnabad. We demand immediate declaration of national calamity by Central Govt. #RedVolunteers,” wrote the CPI(M), West Bengal committee on its official twitter handle while sharing the picture on May 26.Five days later on May 31, TMC’s national spokesperson shared the same picture from his twitter handle. Even though he mentioned that the government was providing relief, nowhere did O’Brien state that the picture was related to relief operations carried out by the state. He wrote: “Sharing some pics taken a week ago #Sunderbans a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Rs 6250 crore relief from #Bengal govt for the state, including Rs 20,000 each for restoration of up to 10 lakh homes lost or destroyed in #Amphan”Super Cyclone Amphan, the first super cyclone in the Bay of Bengal after the super cyclone that hit Odisha in 1999, had hit the Bengal coast on May 20, killing 98 people and affecting more than 10 crore in eight districts. The CPI(M) had written that the picture was of relief operations that were being carried out at Hasnabad, one of the worst-hit areas in the Sunderbans.The Bharatiya Janata Party lashed out at the TMC for this saying that the ruling party has hardly provided any relief and hence they don’t have any pictures to share. “The TMC has hardly provided any relief to the people. From where will they get the pictures of relief work? Hence they are borrowing it from CPI(M). They are busy in looting relief material,” said Dilip Ghosh,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rivals-cpi-m-tmc-share-similar-pictures-of-relief-operations-after-cyclone-amphan-trigger-row/story-BvRhAZLN8Furc9OWvFJvlL.html

This is the first time that a senior minister of government has interacted live with citizens who had filed grievances related to the pandemic and also paved way for other ministries to take up citizen grievances in an effective manner along with a feedback mechanism, the statement issued by the Personnel Ministry said.“The feedback call centres would seek feedback from individual citizens on citizen satisfaction on 1.28 lakh Covid-19 public grievances that have been filed on CPGRAMS (Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System) for the period March 30, 2020 to May 30, 2020,” it said. Singh complimented the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) on reaching the milestone of redressing over one lakh Covid-19 public grievances so far.He said that Covid 19 pandemic has created a world of digital opportunities to empower India’s citizens and DARPG must make best use of the crisis led reforms in coming days.

Amongst the steps taken were the implementation of CPGRAMS reforms in top 20 grievance receiving ministries/departments delineating last mile grievance officers, integration of state/union territories grievance portals with CPGRAMS and feedback call centres, the minister said. Singh said DARPG should bring out a compendium of success stories on successfully redressed public grievances which may be disseminated for restoring confidence in citizens that the government is sensitive to their issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-receives-over-1-lakh-covid-related-grievances-jitendra-singh-launches-feedback-call-centres/story-vbbDqvnD77j4QYW8QiObwL.html
15-06-2020||India||Telangana caps cost of Covid-19 tests, treatment at private hospitals||The Telangana government on Monday capped the cost of Covid-19 tests and treatment at private labs and hospitals across the state and said there were no plans to reimpose lockdown restrictions in the state.State health minister Eatala Rajender told reporters that the private labs authorised by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in the state would not charge more than Rs 2,200 per person for a single Covid-19 diagnostic test.Similarly, the bed charges in private hospitals, including corporate hospitals cannot exceed Rs 4,000 per day in normal wards, Rs 7,500 in Intensive Care Units (ICU) without ventilator and Rs 9,000 with ventilator support.However, the private hospitals would be permitted to collect additional charges for the anti-viral drugs when the patients are on ventilator. Some anti-viral injections would cost up to Rs 50,000, he said.The tests would be done as per the ICMR guidelines, said the minister, adding any suspected patient can undergo a test. However, all positive cases don’t have to get admitted to the hospitals. The asymptomatic patients who test positive would have to be under home quarantine only, unless they develop severe symptoms.KCR on Sunday night announced that in the next one week to ten days, the health department will conduct tests on 50,000 people in 30 Assembly constituencies in and around the capital city.The minister said the health department was establishing a link between private health care establishments and the government authorities for sharing of information related to number of tests, positive and negative cases and number of persons who are admitted at private hospitals.“The private hospitals would have to upload the information about the tests and treatment on the health department portal,” he said.Rajender advised the private labs not to unnecessarily conduct tests for Covid-19 on people who don’t have symptoms. “As far as possible, people could get tested in government labs if they have any symptoms. If they really want to go to private labs, it is their wish,” he said.The government would not take up rapid testing, said the minister, but would continue with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Mass testing would be done in several parts of Hyderabad and other containment zones in the state which reported a high number of cases.The department will do surveillance on each household in Hyderabad to prevent the spread of the deadly disease, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-caps-cost-of-covid-19-tests-treatment-at-private-hospitals/story-a85C30NGhbDRH5dfGpHg5J.html

The same region had recorded an earthquake of 5.5 magnitude with a depth of 10 kilometres at the latitude and the longitude 23.3 and 70.4, respectively, at 8:13 pm the previous evening.While the Gandhinagar-based Institute of Seismological Research (ISR) reported recording of several aftershocks on Monday, the National Centre for Seismology (NCS) recorded one aftershock (a smaller earthquake that follows a big earthquake at the same location) of 4.1 magnitude at 12:57 pm at the same location as Sunday’s epicentre.“This was the only significant aftershock we could record. We cannot predict or forecast if there will be more. Earthquake prediction is not possible with respect to space, time and magnitude,” said JL Gautam, head (operations) at NCS.Gautam said the earthquakes on Sunday and Monday were close to the epicentre of 2001 tremors in Kutch, also called the Bhuj earthquake, which had killed over 30,000 people and destroyed more than 40,000 buildings and other infrastructure.“The earthquake occurred on the Kachchch Mainland Fault. Its epicentre is close to the epicentre of the 2001 earthquake. A 5.5 magnitude earthquake can destroy weak buildings, but this time it’s unlikely to have caused any damage because the villages were rebuilt after the Bhuj earthquake,” Gautam had said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/earthquake-tremors-of-5-5-magnitude-felt-in-gujarat-s-kutch-region/story-f8Kk9yq0cfUOzkE4HQK6hM.html

While the body of her six-year old son floated in the tank by 6 am, the body of nine-year old daughter was fished out in the afternoon, a police official in Suryapet town police station said.“We have taken her into custody and are questioning her to know the reasons behind her extreme step,” the police official said.The woman hails from a village in Suryapet district and her husband is from Hyderabad. They married 14 years ago and had two children. The couple was living in a rented house in Suryapet, where he has been working in an iron scrap shop.Preliminary inquiries by the police revealed that the woman had a quarrel with her husband over some petty issue. “Of late, the husband had been habituated to drinking alcohol and this was the cause of quarrel between the two,” the police said.At around 10 pm on Sunday, the woman, after quarrelling with her husband, came to the tank along with the two kids. “She first pushed the two children into the tank and after some time, she too, wanted to jump but changed her mind at the last moment. She collapsed there and cried for her children all through the night,” the police official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-drowns-two-kids-after-quarrel-with-drunken-husband-in-telangana-cops/story-3qr8dMh4XZ6zJaBXdJbNHN.html

In such cases, after the receipt of the payment via bank transfers, the fraudulent vendors do not make any delivery of items.The top investigative body also issued an alert based on Interpol inputs on instances of the use of methanol for preparing spurious hand sanitisers. Many incidents have been reported in other countries wherein, due to a huge demand for hand sanitisers during the Covid-19 pandemic, the use of methanol was detected to produce fake hand sanitisers. Methanol can be highly toxic and dangerous for the human body.This comes at a time when the entire country is struggling with a rising number of Covid-19 cases with the national tally jumping to 332,424.Last month, the CBI had sent an alert to states against a malicious software threat that uses an update related to Covid-19 pandemic. The alert was about banking trojan Cerberus that lures smartphone users into downloading malicious links related to Covid-19 and then infects devices to do phishing activities. The banking trojan known as Cerberus takes advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic and sends SMS to lure a user into downloading the link containing the malicious software, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-alerts-states-against-online-scams-methanol-laced-fake-sanitisers-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-Ili0MQM6eobespY0OueFLO.html

The Railways, has so far received a demand for coaches from Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and the Delhi government. The rest of the deployment will be done as and when states demand them, he added.The isolation coaches will be under the complete care of the chief medical officer of the state government, in the states where they will be deployed.For national capital Delhi, at least 50 coaches with 800 beds have already been stationed at Shakur Basti railway station.No isolation coaches or beds are in use so far in Delhi.“Another 500 more such isolation coaches for Covid-19 patients have to be deployed in Delhi and we are finalizing the stations where they can be kept,” Yadav said.The Railway Board chairman said it is more suitable to use non-AC coaches for isolation purposes of suspected or confirmed Covid-19 patients. For cooling, wherever required the Railways will provide roof insulation in the coaches, he added.“Last night we had a request from the Maharashtra state government to run suburban trains. We have allowed the Central and Western Railways to run some trains for essential workers, and e-passes will be issued by the state government for the same,” he said.Referring to the Shramik Special trains run by the Railways to transport migrants back to their home states, the Railway Board chairman said, “We have transported more than 60 lakh migrants till date. Only a few migrants are left now. We had asked state governments to send us their demand of remaining trains on June 3 and we received a demand for 171 Shramik Special trains from various states.”“We ended up running 222 Shramik Special trains till June 14. After the Supreme Court’s order we have again sought their need from the state governments to meet the additional demand,” Yadav said.“The average fare for Shramik Special trains was Rs 600 and around 60 lakh migrants have travelled so the total revenue can be calculated through that. The fare was as per normal mail express trains. The Railways recovered only 15% of the cost of operating Shramik Special trains,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-coaches-to-be-used-by-states-when-health-infrastructure-is-exhausted-railways/story-bKOqZY7I5m1F1YcUat6IwO.html

Pakistan’s decision to hand over the two Indian staffers was conveyed minutes after Pakistan’s charge d’affaires Syed Haider Shah was summoned to the external affairs ministry in New Delhi and told that it was the responsibility of the government of Pakistan to ensure the safety and security on the Indian staffers.Nearly seven hours after they went missing, reports emerged in the Pakistani media that the two officials had been arrested in a hit-and-run road accident.WATCH | 2 Indian officials missing in Pakistan: Imran Khan govt relents after summonsIn a strong demarche that referred to media reports on the arrest of the two high commission staffers, the external affairs ministry had told Haider Shah that there should be no interrogation or harassment of the Indian officials. India also underlined that it was Pakistan’s responsibility to ensure safety and security of the Diplomatic Mission’s personnel.“The Pakistani side was asked to return the two officials along with the official car to the High Commission immediately,” a government source told Hindustan Times.Soon after, the Indian high commission received word from the authorities that the two staffers were being held at a police station in Islamabad. “It has been conveyed to the high commission that they can pick up the two Indian officials,” the source said.The two officials were reported missing by the Indian high commission earlier on Monday morning after they left the mission premises in a car but did not reach their destination. For the next six to seven hours, the external affairs ministry in New Delhi and the high commission in Islamabad repeatedly flagged the case to Pakistan’s foreign office. But Pakistani foreign office did not give any details, claiming that they were still “looking into the matter”.The first confirmation that the two officials had been picked up by Pakistani security agencies came on Monday evening after Pakistan media reported the detention of the two staffers in what was described as a “hit-and-run” case.Indian officials had suspected that the high commission staffers had been picked up by Pakistan’s security agencies when they went missing earlier in the day. Their detention was suspected to be a case of tit-for-tat since New Delhi had expelled two officials posted in Pakistan high commission for espionage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-high-commission-officials-missing-in-pak-to-be-released-india-told-after-strong-demarche/story-rB7tOEjMQm52xyVNoT0nPI.html

Polling on 6th July 2020. Last Date of making nominations: 25th June, 2020,” a tweet from the Press Information Bureau (PIB) said.A press release by the EC said that the election is being held to fill one “casual vacancy” in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council since a member Dokka Manikya Vara Prasad resigned on Marh 9. His term was scheduled to end on March 29, 2023.The council works like Rajya Sabha. Once in two years, one-third of its members retire and new members are elected by local bodies representatives, assembly members, graduates, and teachers. Some members are also nominated.The council was revived in 2007 after a gap of nearly 20 years.But the present YSR Congress government passed a resolution in the legislative assembly in January this year to again abolish the Upper House.Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy said that the Council has become meaningless and a hurdle for passing laws. He pointed out how the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) having a majority in the Council stalled two bills seeking to create three capitals and also that on the introduction of English medium in government schools.Reddy said the government was incurring Rs 60 crore expenditure annually on the Council. He said the poor state cannot afford it anymore.The resolution was later sent to the Union home ministry, which will have to introduce a bill in Parliament for the Council’s abolition. The exercise may take a year, officials said.Andhra Pradesh had its first legislative council from 1958 to 1985 when the then N T Rama Rao government abolished it. Reddy’s father, Y S Rajasekhar Reddy, restored the council in 2007 when he was the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-legislative-council-election-to-be-held-on-july-6/story-9Ag4pwcDIde4WgISdvZx7L.html

He also asked the AIADMK government to come clean on allegations of community transmission and the steps it intended to take to curb the rising coronavirus cases in Tamil Nadu, especially in capital city Chennai. “On June 9, the numbers by the Greater Chennai Corporation show that 460 people died due to Covid-19, but the Tamil Nadu state health department reported only 224 deaths on the same day. How could government officials be unfamiliar with reporting mechanisms even after 85 days of the lockdown,” the DMK president said addressing a virtual press conference.

15-06-2020||India||Airlines can allow passengers on middle seat under DGCA guidelines: HC||The Bombay High Court on Monday permitted all flight operators to allow passengers to occupy middle seats in flights, but said they should strictly comply with guidelines of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.A division bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade refused to accept the contentions raised in a petition filed by Air India pilot Deven Kanani, who said the middle seats of all international and domestic flights should be kept vacant to prevent the spread of coronavirus.“We are of the prima facie view that the safety and health of passengers on board the aircraft qua (with regard to) COVID-19 virus is adequately taken care of even if the middle seat of the aircraft is not kept vacant on account of passenger load and seat capacity, the court said.The court permitted air carriers to allow passengers to occupy the middle seat in flights, but said they should strictly comply with DGCA’s guidelines on measures to be taken to prevent spread of the coronavirus.The DGCA in its May 31 circular said flight operators should try to keep the middle seat vacant but if it has been booked, then the passenger shall be provided with a wraparound gown in addition to the mask and face shield.If possible, passengers from one family or those travelling in one group could be allotted seats along with the middle seat, it said in the circular.The court in its order said it has not seen any material to show wrongdoing on part of the Air India and Air India Express or violating circulars issued by the DGCA on March 23 and endangering the lives of passengers travelling back to India from abroad in the Vande Bharat flights. The bench noted that all precautionary measures, as stipulated with regard to passengers and the crew, are complied with by all flight operators. Upon disembarkment, thermal screening of all passengers is again carried out and they are thereafter compulsorily placed under institutional quarantine for seven to 14 days. It is not established till date that any passenger, who tested positive, has been infected on board an aircraft, the court said. It further said even if the middle seat is kept vacant, the person occupying the window seat, while getting out for going to the washroom and thereafter returning to the seat, is likely to touch the person sitting on the aisle seat. The court noted that a high-level expert committee of the Ministry of Civil Aviation has specifically considered and rejected the suggestion that seats must be kept vacant between passengers. Kanani claimed theAirIndiawas violating guidelines laid down in a circular dated March 23 by the Centre, to prevent the spread of COVID-19 during air travel.TheAirIndia, however, had opposed the plea, and informed the court last month that it was following all safety precautions as prescribed by the DGCA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-permits-airlines-to-allow-passengers-on-middle-seat-under-dgca-guidelines/story-Lu2JC5IS35EQdAOznbVzwN.html
15-06-2020||India||Temperature over India likely to rise by over 4 degrees Celsius by end of 21st century: Govt report||The average temperature over India is projected to rise by 4.4 degrees Celsius, while the intensity of heat waves is likely to increase by 3-4 times by the end of the century, according to a government report on the impact of climate change on the country.India’s average temperature has risen by around 0.7 degree Celsius during 1901–2018, largely on account of Green House Gases-induced warming, states the report by the Ministry of Earth Sciences. It is likely to be published by Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday.The report has been prepared by the Centre for Climate Change Research, a cell under MoES’ Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. “By the end of the twenty-first century, average temperature over India is projected to rise by approximately 4.4 degrees Celsius,” the report states. In the 30-year period between 1986 and 2015, temperatures of the warmest day and the coldest night of the year have risen by about 0.63 degrees Celsius and 0.4 degree Celsius, respectively. By the end of the century, the temperatures of the warmest day and the coldest night are projected to rise by approximately 4.7 degrees Celsius and 5.5 degrees Celsius, respectively, according to the report.The frequencies of occurrence of warm days and warm nights are projected to increase by 55 per cent and 70 per cent, it says.“The frequency of summer (April–June) heat waves over India is projected to be 3 to 4 times higher by the end of the twenty-first century,” the report states. The average duration of heat wave events is also projected to approximately double. The combined rise in surface temperature and humidity, amplification of heat stress is expected across India, particularly over the Indo-Gangetic and Indus river basins, the report notes. Sea Surface Temperature (SST) of the tropical Indian Ocean has risen by a degree Celsius on average during 1951–2015, markedly higher than the global average SST warming of 0.7 degree Celsius, over the same period, the report states. Sea Surface Temperatures does have an influence over the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean Dipole is linked to the SSTs of the Indian Ocean. A positive IOD, linked to the cooling/warming of the Indian Ocean waters, generally helps to have a good monsoon. Sea-level in the North Indian Ocean (NIO) has risen at a rate of 1.06–1.75 millimetre per year during 1874–2004 and has accelerated to 3.3 millimetre per year in the last two and a half decades (1993–2017), which is comparable to the current rate of global mean sea-level rise.At the end of the twenty-first century, steric sea level in the NIO is projected to rise by approximately 300 millimetres relative to the average over 1986–2005. The summer monsoon precipitation (June to September) over India has also declined by around 6 per cent from 1951 to 2015, with notable decreases over the Indo-Gangetic Plains and the Western Ghats, the report further states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/temperature-over-india-likely-to-rise-by-over-4-degress-celsius-by-end-of-21st-century-govt-report/story-ZsXcDjcYv7DiHWG7F8egGO.html

He made the remarks while addressing the member of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Uttarakhand.“Our army has Gorkha Regiment whose soldiers have displayed valour and courage on numerous times for the country. Its war cry is ‘Jai Maha Kali, Ayo Re Gorkhali (Hail Mother Kali, here comes the Gorkha)’ and Maha Kali is also in Kolkata, Kamakhya and Vindhyachal with devotees all around India. Then how can the ties between the two countries break?” Singh said in his address to BJP members of Garhwal division. The statement comes days after the Nepal Parliament passed the country’s new political map showing key areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as their own. The Nepal government decided to amend its map after the inauguration of a crucial road connecting Lipulekh Pass and Dharchula area by Singh in Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand. Nepal had raised strong objection, claiming the road passes through its territory. ALSO WATCH | Nepal parliament approves new map, India’s defence expert smells China’s role“Indo-Nepal ties are not an ordinary one. We have a relation of ‘Roti and Beti’ which cannot be broken by any power of the world,” Singh said in reference to the strong people-to-people connect between the two countries. Speaking on the ties between the two countries, the defence minister also mentioned the ‘spiritual relations’ citing highly revered Pashupatinath temple in Nepal.“We don’t have just geographical, historical or social relations with Nepal but a spiritual one also. Who can forget Baba Pashupatinath? How can he be separated from Baba Amarnath, Somnath and Kashi Vishwanath? This relation is not from this world but a totally another world,” he said. Singh suggested that there have been some misconceptions on Lipulekh on Nepal’s part “which would be solved through dialogue.”“If there are some misconceptions on the road between Lipulekh and Dharchula among Nepal’s people, then we will sit together and solve those issues through dialogue. And I can say this with full confidence that no Indian has any hatred towards Nepal as the relation is so deep between us,” said Singh. Earlier during the event, he also hailed the steps taken under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. “PM Modi took the difficult challenge of fighting the pandemic and so far has taken many bold and crucial decisions to contain it. Those efforts have not only been lauded by the other countries but WHO itself,” he said. The Defence minister said, “Our government under PM Modi also strengthened the health safety infrastructure within a short period of time in the pandemic. As a result, we are now not only producing the PPE kits for our health workers but are exporting them to other countries also. We are sure that together we will soon win this fight.”The virtual rally was also attended by Union human resource department minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, BJP national vice-president Shyam Jajoo and other party leaders through video conferencing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-can-india-nepal-ties-break-in-rajnath-singh-s-speech-references-to-gorkhas-and-spiritual-connect/story-jRdpEpWCCWj6EUTPDfOy3J.html

The kits will allow faster diagnosis without laboratory examination Standard Q Covid-19 Ag detection kit (rapid antigen test kits) is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for qualitative detection of specific antigens to SARS-CoV-2. It has been developed by SD Biosensor, a South Korea based company, the ICMR said in an advisory. Suspected individuals who test negative for Covid-19 by rapid antigen test should be tested sequentially by RT-PCR to rule out infection, whereas a positive test should be considered as a true positive and does not need reconfirmation by RT-PCR test, said ICMR said.The Standard Q Covid-19 Ag detection can be interpreted as positive or negative after 15 minutes of putting the sample into the well by appearance of test and control lines, which can be read with a naked eye, requiring no specialized equipment, it said. The maximum duration for interpreting a positive or negative test is 30 minutes. After that the test strip should be discarded, it said. In view of its high specificity while relatively low sensitivity, ICMR recommends the use of Standard Q Covid-19 Ag detection assay as a point of care diagnostic assay for testing under (containment zones and healthcare settings) settings in combination with the gold standard RT-PCR test, the advisory said.The ICMR further said that the Standard Q Covid-19 Ag rapid antigen detection test has a very high specificity (i.e. ability to detect true negatives). “Specificity ranged from 99.3 per cent to 100 per cent at the two sites. Sensitivity of the test (i.e. ability to detect true positives) ranged from 50.6 per cent to 84 per cent in two independent evaluations, depending upon the viral load of the patient. Higher viral load correlated with higher sensitivity,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-recommends-use-of-rapid-antigen-kits-for-testing-in-containment-zones-healthcare-settings/story-3vjXq6LfrEKJ5Atn0IXxHO.html

By Monday noon, the tally further increased to 4,159.The state’s Covid-19 tally was 2,000 on June 4; it took just 10 days for the figure to double. Assam recorded its first Covid-19 case on March 31 and it took nearly two months to reach 1,000 cases on May 29.While the graph for infections is rising sharply - around 200-250 new cases daily since June 4 - the recovery rate has also shown an upward trend. A total of 460 patients had recovered in the state on June 4. The figure was 1,961 on June 14.The sharp rise has been attributed to return of nearly 2.5 lakh people to the state from other parts of the country. The migrants started arriving in Assam on May 4 when inter-state movement resumed.“I am expecting a further spike in cases in the next few days as nearly 25,000 more people are expected to reach the state by trains. Seventeen of these trains would come from Kerala and two from Karnataka,” Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told journalists on Saturday. Other states in the North-East have also recorded a spike, due to homecoming of returnees. Tripura, with 1,079 Covid-19 cases, has the second highest tally in the region followed by Manipur with 458 cases till Sunday. Nagaland has 168 cases, Mizoram 117, Arunachal Pradesh 91 and Meghalaya 44.Guwahati could be under lockdownWhile the number of Covid-19 cases in Assam is increasing rapidly, the government is more concerned about the state’s and the region’s biggest city Guwahati where over two dozen cases without any travel or contact history have been detected till date.“The situation in Guwahati is a bit critical as we have 25 cases without any history. It is worrying and we have decided to increase our surveillance mechanism,” Sarma said on Saturday.From June 15, the state government has decided to conduct 50,000 tests till the end of the month to check possible community spread of the disease. Tests would be carried out at petrol pumps, loading, unloading and parking sites of trucks coming from outside, eateries on highways, weigh bridges etc.“We have a suspicion that most cases without history have some connection to these places frequented by truckers from outside the state. As per Centre’s guidelines, the truck drivers and attendants are not tested for Covid-19 and are allowed to leave without spending time in quarantine,” said Sarma.Residents who feel that they have some Covid-19 related symptoms can also visit 12 healthcare centres across the city and get themselves tested free of cost.“If we see the situation deteriorating and if we get a sizeable number of positive cases in the 50,000 tests residents of Guwahati will have to be ready for another lockdown. If we have to take tough decisions, we will not shy away from it,” Sarma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-s-covid-19-cases-double-in-10-days-tally-now-at-4-159/story-9TkZCytkB0TgypwogWmrJJ.html

The first family was, however, allowed to see his funeral over a video call.Naresh Akula, who played as a mid-fielder, represented Odisha in the Santosh Trophy, India’s premier state level football tournament, three times from 2006 to 2008. He represented Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) in the reputed I-League.Aula, who worked as security supervisor in ONGC since 2009, was posted to Silchar a couple of years ago after serving in Mumbai for a decade. A formidable midfielder, Naresh represented Odisha three times in 2006, 2007 and 2008 in the Santosh Trophy before he started playing for the ONGC at the reputed I-league.The night before he died, he had reportedly spoken to his family staying in the Bhanjanagar area of Ganjam district and expressed his desire to come back home. His elder brother Bishnu Aula, who spoke to him, said he had advised the footballer to put off the visit as he was likely to be put in quarantine for 14 days upon arrival due to raging coronavirus pandemic. The next morning, his family - which included his wife Arathi, his parents and other siblings - in Bhanjanagar were told that he had passed away in a hospital at Silchar.“When we spoke to the ONGC officials asking them to send my brother’s body to our home, we were told that a woman from Mizoram, named Lal Muan Kui, is a claimant for the body as her name was listed as my brother’s wife in the official records. We were shocked as my brother was already married (since 2012) and has a four-year-old daughter,” said Bishnu.As the wait for the body went on till evening that day, the family contacted the office of the union ministry of petroleum and natural gas, the parent ministry of the ONGC. “We were told that a decision will be taken. We sent the video clip of my brother’s marriage as well as the photo of her daughter on WhatsApp seeking the ministry’s intervention. However, on June 11 night we were told that the body has been sent to Mizoram as in the ONGC records his legally wedded wife’s name was not there,” he said.The family was however allowed a small concession as they could see Naresh’s burial ceremony over video calling. “We were too shocked to react,” said his father Alabandru Aula.The footballer’s family said they would meet petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan seeking his intervention in the case.The footballer’s elder brother said the family came to know about the presence of another woman in his life four years ago after some of the fellow footballers informed them about it. “However, he kept dodging our queries. Our suspicion increased when he stopped coming to Odisha one and half years ago citing work pressure,” said his brother.Naresh also played for the Maharashtra state football team.An ONGC spokesman said he would look into the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/footballer-dies-1st-wife-shocked-after-body-sent-to-official-spouse/story-GQgsY3sUmOueruPoEPjpVK.html

Business and trade-related activities have also picked up in the state. In such a scenario, the state government does not have any plans to impose the lockdown again,” Rupani said in a statement.He said while the battle against Covid-19 pandemic is on, people are also learning to live with it.Rupani’s statement came after rumours on the social media that his government may impose restrictions again as Covid-19 cases are not decreasing in the state.Since the last one month, on an average 400 new coronavirus cases are emerging in the state every day.Till Sunday, Gujarat reported 23,590 Covid-19 cases and 1,478 deaths due to the viral infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-plan-to-impose-lockdown-again-in-gujarat-says-cm-vijay-rupani/story-N5hw09rvzB5RQDS4dtfcQN.html
15-06-2020||India||Rajasthan excise department restarts production of royal liquor||The Rajasthan excise department has restarted production of royal heritage liquor at its Jaipur distillery this month. The first brand, Royal Chandr Haas, should be out in market in a day or two, said officials.The Rajasthan State Ganganagar Sugar Mills (RSGSM) acquired recipes of the brews from the erstwhile royal families in 2003 to keep them alive. Eight brands of heritage liquor, whose recipes came from three royal families, were produced between 2003 and 2008 and then the production stopped because the company failed to clear its inventory. In 2018, the pending stock was sold and inventory cleared.Twelve years later, the sugar mills, which manufactures country liquor, is restarting production of four brands – Royal Chandr Haas, Royal Kasturi, Royal Saunf and Royal Jagmohan.“Chandr Haas will be out in the market in next two-three days,” said said Kesar Lal Meena, RSGSM general manager. “There will be two packing, 180 ml and 750 ml.”“The production stopped in 2008 because of low demand in market for these brands because they were expensive. It is for this reason that this time we also have a smaller packing of 180 ml which even a common man can afford,” he said.Meena said the price of the two packings will be decided on Tuesday and the bottles will reach retailers on Wednesday.“The brand will be available across 40 depots of Rajasthan State Beverages Corporation Limited, which handles supply of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) and beer, and 19 depots of RSGSM,” said CL Yadav, an independent director of RSGSM.The brew of Chandr Haas has come from the erstwhile royals of Kanota, a princely unit of Jaipur state. Jagmohan is from the Udaipur royal family, and Kasturi and Saunf belong to the Jodhpur royals.Meena said the production will be done at Royal Heritage Liquor Distillery in Jhotwara in Jaipur city. The liquor will be bottled in glass and not in ceramic like it was done in 2003-2008. “Ceramic bottle adds to the cost,” he said.The RSGSM will produce 1,600 cases each of 180 ml and 750 ml bottles. One case will contain 48 bottles of 180 ml and 12 of 750 ml. The sugar mill, which was churning out 2.4 million bottles of country liquor every day until the plants closed during the lockdown, began producing hand sanitisers from March 25.Yadav said the five plants have produced 1.5 million bottles of sanitisers for free distribution and 2.5 million for sale from its depots. The sanitisers are available in six packings of 100 ml, 200 ml, 500 ml, 1000 ml, 2,000 ml and 5,000 ml.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-excise-department-restarts-production-of-royal-liquor/story-1h5fOucBOKDuAMUsDo4qUM.html

The minister said that the road built by the Border Roads Organization (BRO) in Lipulekh is “very much part of the Indian territory”. Singh’s comments came after the government of Nepal, over the weekend, got a unanimous approval of its lower house in parliament to a new map depicting disputed areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as Nepalese territories.India reacted, stating that such “artificial enlargement” of territorial claim is untenable. Some misconception has risen in Nepal regarding this road. But I would like to say that as far as Nepal is concerned, we not only have social, geographical, historical or cultural relations with them but also a devotional relation. India can never forget this: Defence Minister https://t.co/9fEFYp7TPbRakesh Sood, who was Indian Ambassador to Nepal from 2008 to 2011, said both sides have allowed the relationship to come to a “very very dangerous point” and that India should have found time to engage with Kathmandu as it pressed for talks on the issue since November.“I think we have displayed a lack of sensitivity, and now the Nepalese have dug themselves deeper into the hole from which they will find it difficult to come out,” he told news agency PTI.Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday addressed the Jammu Jan Samvad virtual rally during which he talked about the Modi government’s commitment towards the growth and development of Jammu and Kashmir in the coming years. “Just wait, soon people of PoK will demand that they want to be with India and not under the rule of Pakistan, and the day this happens, a goal of our Parliament will also be accomplished,” he said yesterday.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bound-by-roti-beti-rajnath-singh-says-india-nepal-ties-are-unbreakable-beyond-ordinary/story-Yp0U5Hd5vRe9dyC1zNRIbJ.html

15-06-2020||India||Arunachal Pradesh district gives ‘human face’ to care of Covid-19 patients||Doctors, nurses and other attendants at a Covid-19 care centre in Arunachal Pradesh’s Changlang district have started pasting their photographs on their personal protective equipment (PPE) kits allowing patients to know their care providers.Changlang, the second most populous district in Arunachal, recorded its first Covid-19 case on June 1. The district now has 55 positive cases, the highest among all districts in the state. Arunachal has a total of 91 cases until Sunday.“Patients in the centres are kept in isolation and they aren’t allowed to go out or meet anyone. Though there is a helpline which they can use, they don’t get to see a human face and even their care providers look the same as all are covered in PPE kits,” Devansh Yadav, Changlang’s deputy commissioner, said.“The patients are already in stress because of the disease. So we thought that since the doctors and other attendants talk to them regularly and they have a level of comfort with each other, the patients should get to know who are the ones taking care of them,” he added.Yadav, who is a doctor himself and did his MBBS from AIIMS, Delhi before joining the civil service, got the idea of pasting photos of caregivers on their PPEs from a friend based in New York.“My friend told me about this practice used by several hospitals there and how it brought some cheer to the patients. So when we started getting cases in our district from the beginning of June, we decided to implement it as no helpline can replace a human face,” said Yadav.“We have got some feedback from the Miao centre and it seems patients are happy to know the faces behind the PPE kits. From Monday, we will implement it in the other centres where Covid-19 patients are admitted,” he added.The district has eight Covid-19 care centres and three of them are being used to admit positive cases. The one in Miao is located nearly 100km away from the district headquarters and has half a dozen patients.“On the advice of the DC, we started printing photos of doctors and other care providers in A4 size papers and pasted them in front side of the PPE kits,” Dr Hensam Jongsam, the in-charge of the Miao centre, said.“The patients are nervous about the disease and their conditions. So there was not much of reaction from them, but once they are asked about it they give a positive opinion,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arunachal-pradesh-district-gives-human-face-to-care-of-covid-19-patients/story-V6ZFFFgKCxxcqy9hk8N4rJ.html

The BJP has, however, dismissed the charge. The Congress has fielded K C Venugopal and Neeraj Dangi as its candidates. The numbers in the state assembly suggest that the Congress would win two seats in the Rajya Sabha elections on June 19 and the BJP one. But the BJP has fielded two candidates, triggering charges that it was counting on horse-trading. Rajasthan Congress president and deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, who had gone to New Delhi on Saturday, had to stay back in the capital due to personal reasons, party leaders said. Pilot was to return to Rajasthan on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-congress-mlas-lodged-at-hotel-watch-mahatma-gandhi-movie-perform-yoga/story-9ubMMZORktF5ixBBNKYF1O.html

Police swung into action to track the central committee member of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) but found that they got the intelligence input a day late.Milind Baburao Teltumbde alias Deepak Teltumbde alias Jeeva is one of the senior-most functionaries of the CPI(Maoist) and special zone secretary for Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh (MMC) zone. Teltumbde has been given the task to create a new territory that allows rebels easy passage from east to west and vice-versa, and safe abode for the senior rebel leaders.Police officers said Teltumbde has been visiting the MMC areas regularly and has recruited about 200 locals for a commando unit, called Vistaar Dalam, of MMC. “Deepak is presently concentrating on training and developing human intelligence inside the MMC which the Maoists lack,” a senior police officer of Chhattisgarh said.Jitendra Shukla, Rajnandgaon’s superintendent of police (SP) who has been tracking him for long, said Teltumbde mostly lives in the jungles of Mandla, Rajnandgaon and Kawardha districts in Chhattisgarh, which comes under MMC zoneBut he has spent the past four months in the urban areas of Maharashtra for meeting party cadres and working out a strategy, Shukla said.“We have come to know that in Nagpur, he met many people most in an auto-rickshaw to prevent detection. Teltumbde has a good network in Vidharbha region especially in Nagpur,” he said.“Teltumbde never trusts anyone,” another Chhattisgarh police officer, who has created his digital profile based on interrogation of rebels, who worked with him in the recent past, said.A close aide of Teltumbde surrendered in 2019 in Rajnandgaon, which helped the police get information about his movement during Moaist operations in three states, mainly in Madhya Pradesh.“Well-informed and well-read, Deepak is always on the move. He knows the jungle in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra very well and it is not easy to catch him,” said the second senior police officer, adding that off-late he has developed health issues, which has restricted his movement.“Deepak is suffering from spondylitis because of which he has lost conscious while walking in the jungle. He has diabetes and his right knee has also been operated once,” he said.Teltumbde moves heavily-armed bodyguards and a platoon of Maoists in the jungles. According to senior Maoist leader Pahad Singh, who surrendered in 2018, he takes all the major decision of the zone.“He was the person who pushed the idea to develop Amarkantak as ‘base area’ of MMC, in a meeting in 2016, in which Central Committee Members (CCM) of the CPI(Maoists) including him were present,” a senior Indian Police officer (IPS) officer who interrogated Pahaad Singh, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/well-informed-well-read-deepak-teltumbade-is-the-man-tasked-to-form-new-maoists-zone/story-DElQNHrYtW9bKzneG9SbRP.html

Sushant Singh Rajput, who dropped out of an engineering college to pursue a career in Bollywood and delivered several hit films over the past decade, was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai on Sunday. He was 34.Dattatreya Bargude, an assistant commissioner of Mumbai Police, confirmed the actor’s death and said that no “note” was found at his residence.“I cannot imagine how this happened. I request the government to launch a CBI inquiry. I think there is a deep conspiracy behind his death. Sushant cannot commit suicide,” Pappu Yadav told reporters.“I want a CBI inquiry in the matter. Sushant was a workaholic and good man, not the kind of person that would commit suicide. He rose from the bottom. Made Bihar proud. Now the state of Bihar is in mourning,” he added.Yadav also claimed that it could be a case of homicide.Rajput was born in Bihar’s capital of Patna and was the youngest of five children of a government employee. He completed his schooling in Delhi before securing a seat in an engineering college in the Capital in 2003. He dropped out of the course to pursue acting professionally three years later and joined the Barry John Acting School.The actor landed his first role in the Hindi serial, Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil, in 2008 but gained popularity the next year with his character in the popular soap, Pavitra Rishta.He debuted in Bollywood in 2013 with the movie Kai Po Che!, adapted from a novel by Chetan Bhagat but became a household name with the success of MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, a biopic on the World Cup-winning Indian cricket captain, in 2016.Sushant Singh Rajput was last seen in Nitesh Tiwari’s Chhichhore in 2019 and also acted in the thriller Drive that was released on Netflix the same year.(Please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist if you need support or know someone who does.

There were 325 fatalities in the last 24 hours which takes the country’s death toll to 9,520, according to the health ministry.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIndia’s recovery rate continued to rise as 169,797 patients were cured of the deadly infection taking it to a little over 51% from Sunday’s 50.59%.The number of recovered Covid-19 patients in the worst-hit state of Maharashtra also went up with 50,978 people discharged from hospitals. Maharashtra’s case tally stood at 107,958 and the state reported 3,950 deaths so far.In Delhi, Union home minister Amit Shah has called another round of meeting. Shah will meet members of all political parties on Monday for further assessment of the pandemic situation in the Capital.Amit Shah had announced a comprehensive door-to-door survey in containment zones for contact tracing and promised the city 500 railway coaches having a capacity of 8,000 beds to treat Covid-19 patients to mitigate any possible shortage of beds.Delhi has recorded 41,182 infections, with 24,032 active cases, and 1,327 deaths. From Monday, June 8, to Sunday, the city has registered 12,246 cases. In the previous week—June 1-7— it had recorded 9,092 cases.In Tamil Nadu, the number of those affected by the respiratory disease stood at 44,661 and the state’s death toll is 435, according to the Union health ministry.Gujarat, another state which has contributed to the rising Covid-19 cases in India, has recorded 23,544 infections and 1,477 deaths till date.A new pre-print study has said the eight-week lockdown in India shifts the peak of the epidemic by 34-76 days and reduces the number of cases at the end of the lockdown by 69-97%The study was done by academics at the department of community medicine and School of Public health at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Research and Education and Research, Chandigarh, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, ICMR. It was funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).India imposed a lockdown that was nearly 10 weeks long and some of the restrictions are still in place although many have been eased.The study, which is yet to be peer reviewed, also claimed that “intensification of public health surveillance measures with 60% effectiveness” would reduce the number of cases at the peak by 70% and cumulatively by 26.6%. Such measures would also reduce the requirement for ICU beds and ventilators by 83%, the study added.It puts the cost of managing Covid-19 in India at 4.5% of GDP in the absence of any “intervention” and 6.2% with “intensified public health measures.”It said that India’s health care infrastructure may prove inadequate later this year with the demand for isolation and ICU beds and ventilators exceeding supply in November even with “intensified public health measures with 60% effectiveness.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-over-11-000-covid-19-cases-for-third-straight-day/story-DC2zcaoPWTG5DwGnXeVcjI.html

15-06-2020||India||From 11% to over 50%: How India’s Covid-19 recovery rate steadily improved in 2 months||India is the fourth worst-affected country by the coronavirus disease pandemic. The number of cases has already crossed the three-lakh mark.However, there is a relief as the recovery rate has improved in the country. According to the Union health ministry data, the recovery rate has now crossed 50 per cent with 1,62,378 patients cured so far, leaving 1,49,348 cases active.In fact, the recovery rate of Delhi and Mumbai is among the highest in the world. In New York, the worst-affected city in badly hit United States has seen 21.23 per cent people recovering from the disease. In New Jersey, this percentage is 18.88. In contrast, Delhi’s the recovery rate is 38.36 per cent and Mumbai has seen 45.65 per cent patients getting cured of the disease. However, the two cities have seen a wave of Covid-19 cases - Delhi recorded 2,224 cases on Sunday, the third consecutive day it has seen more than 2,000 new infections.The health ministry said that the healthy recovery rate was a result of “timely case identification” and “proper clinical management”.The recovery rate has been steadily increasing in the country. On May 19, India recovery rate from the coronavirus disease stood at 38.73 per cent. It improved to 40.32 per cent two days later - the first time India’s recovery rate crossed the milestone. Since then, it has been improving.On May 31, the health ministry had announced that the recovery rate in the country stands at 47.76 per cent. It further improced to 48.19 per cent on June 2. It stood at 11.42 per cent on April 15.India is faring much better than other worst-hit countries in terms of cases per million of population. India has recorded 234 cases per million of its population, the spread of the disease in other countries has been war greater - US (6,477/million), Brazil (4,004/million), Russia (3,625/million), UK (4,337/million).India is also placed much better in terms of numbers of deaths per million of population, which is 7 per million of India’s population currently. Other countries like the US (355/million), Brazil (201/million), Russia (48/million) and UK (614/million), had posted a higher number of deaths in ratio to their population.The health ministy said that Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) testing capacity for detecting Covid-19 cases is being ramped up continuously. In total, 893 laboratories - 646 government and 247 private - tested 56,58,614 swab samples till 9 am on Sunday (June 14) with 1,51,432 of them in the last 24 hours, the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-11-to-over-50-how-india-s-covid-19-recovery-rate-steadily-improved-in-2-months/story-72WhG6yttPx3OTLi1f9MHN.html
15-06-2020||India||China, Pak possess more nuclear weapons than India: Defence think-tank SIPRI||China and Pakistan possess more nuclear weapons than India, according to a new yearbook released by a leading conflict and armaments think-tank on Monday.The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)’s Yearbook 2020 pegs the number of nuclear warheads in the Chinese arsenal at 320, while the nuclear forces of Pakistan and India are estimated to have 160 and 150 weapons, respectively.The figures have been updated till January 2020.India and its neighbours were ranked in the same order by SIPRI last year too when China possessed 290 nuclear warheads, Pakistan 150-160 and India had 130-140 warheads at the start of 2019.The findings come at a time when India and China are caught in a border confrontation along the contested line of actual control in eastern Ladakh. Also, there is a noticeable military buildup on both sides of the border—stretching from Ladakh to Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.China is carrying out “significant modernisation” of its nuclear arsenal and developing a “so-called nuclear triad for the first time” made up of new land and sea-based missiles and nuclear-capable fighter jets, the SIPRI said in a statement announcing the launch of the yearbook.“India and Pakistan are slowly increasing the size and diversity of their nuclear forces,” it said.The yearbook, which “assesses the current state of armaments, disarmament and international security”, found while there has been an overall decrease in the number of nuclear warheads in 2019, all nuclear weapon-possessing countries continue to modernise their nuclear arsenals. With 6,375 and 5,800 warheads, Russia and the United States together possess more than 90% of global nuclear weapons.The nine nuclear-armed countries—the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea—together account for an estimated 13,400 nuclear weapons as of January 2020.“This marked a decrease from the 13,865 nuclear weapons that SIPRI estimated these states possessed at the beginning of 2019. Around 3,720 of the nuclear weapons are currently deployed with operational forces and nearly 1,800 of these are kept in a state of high operational alert,” SIPRI’s statement said.It also highlighted low levels of transparency in reporting on nuclear weapon capabilities.“China now publicly displays its nuclear forces more frequently than in the past but releases little information about force numbers or future development plans,” the statement said.“The governments of India and Pakistan make statements about some of their missile tests but provide no information about the status or size of their arsenals,” it added.India was the third-biggest military spender in the world last year after the US and China, according to a SIPRI report released in April. It was the first time that two Asian countries featured among the top three military spenders.New Delhi’s defence spending grew by 6.8% to reach $71.1 billion in 2019, said the report on Trends in World in World Military Expenditure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-pakistan-possess-more-nuclear-weapons-than-india-defence-think-tank/story-phAp0fW2uJS4hovk4F77jL.html

He was 34. Dattatreya Bargude, assistant commissioner of police, confirmed the actor’s death and said that no ‘note’ was found at his residence. Abhishek Trimukhe, DCP, zone 9, said an accidental death report (ADR) was registered in the afternoon. Rajput’s death was condoled by people from all professions.“His rise in the world of entertainment inspired many and he leaves behind several memorable performances. Shocked by his passing away. My thoughts are with his family and fans,” tweeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Born in Bihar’s Patna, Rajput was the youngest of five children of a government employee. He completed his schooling in Delhi before securing a seat in an engineering college in the Capital in 2003. He dropped out of the course to pursue acting professionally three years later and joined the Barry John Acting School.

15-06-2020||India||Covid helped to open up about mental health||One central feature of human beings today is that they believe they can manage the toughest of situations. But the truth is, there’s a limit to engineering, innovation and management skills. Usually, our bodies reminds us of that limit. During the lockdown, there was much talk about mental health. It is true-seeing the rapid spread of Covid-19, lives lost, including people we know and the terror of being attacked, coupled with economic slowdown, has been terrifying for most people. It is only natural that many more people will be hit by mental health concerns.There’s one thing we should be aware of, however : the role of toxins in mental health. Heavy metals like Mercury, Lead and Arsenic and some pesticides, for example, have a known role to play in this matter. They add to the chemical burden of our brain and impact it in specific, deleterious ways, such as depression and anxiety.Covid-19 has helped India to open up about mental health. Of the many things we need to do, tightening regulations around toxics and public information is one. What we have to do is to strengthen our toxics reduction regime. We’ve got to phase out all three within a time period-many developing countries already have. In India, most paints and petrol have dumped lead. Dental amalgams are slowly shifting. But there’s a lot of work ahead. The Pesticides continue to be widely available which must be phased out. Reducing our toxicity load is one way to build our resilience ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-helped-to-open-up-about-mental-health/story-rlXk3G4Qpsef5oDYdrPx9K.html
15-06-2020||India||158 booked in Jharkhand lynching, mob violence||The police on Sunday lodged an FIR against eight identified and 150 unidentified people for allegedly being part of a mob that attacked and killed a murder accused and burnt four houses of his relatives in Giridih district’s Pipratand village, Jharkhand.The incident took place on June 13 when a mob of over 150, armed with traditional weapons, attacked the house of Suresh Marandi, reportedly a member of banned left wing extremist (LWE) group CPI-ML and absconding murder accused, and set it to fire.The mob took hold of Marandi while he was trying to escape. They also burnt three other houses of Marandi’s relatives who were also accused in the murder case. However, the police managed to rescue seven people. DSP Neeraj Kumar Singh, who was camping in the village, under Pirtand police station, said, “Heavy numbers of police force and CRPF personnel have been deployed in the region. The situation is completely under control now.” Ashok Prasad, officer in-charge of Pirtand police station, said, “An FIR has been registered in Marandi’s lynching case. Strict action will be taken.”He added that for the safety of Marandi’s family, they have been kept at the Bisunpur Panchayat Bhawan. “We are keeping a strict vigil on the movement of villagers to prevent any further attack on Marandi’s relatives residing in the village,” Prasad said. “Five accused allegedly involved in Kishku’s murder have been arrested and sent to jail.”An eerie silence prevailed in village even after 36 hours of the incident even as forces took out flag march in the village on Sunday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/158-booked-in-jharkhand-lynching-mob-violence/story-7rcpAEN50kTuz2U8IJkvZO.html
15-06-2020||India||Data takes centre stage in virus-ravaged world||The world, as we knew it until 2019, does not exist anymore. In the last six months, every aspect of our life has changed. And along with the international health crisis and economic disruption it has brought, the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has also taken over the conversations of our daily lives.Perhaps one of the most prominent changes it has brought is a newfound obsession with data where line graphs and histograms have replaced memes and other forwards in our WhatsApp conversations and Twitter feeds. People of all ages and from all professions now talk the language of data scientists, and everyone is mouthing terms such as reproductive rates, infection rate, mortality rate, doubling rate, flattening the curve, and exponential growth curve.We take a look at some of the most important data concepts that have become common conversation topics since the spread of the pandemic.Flattening of the curveIt is perhaps the most commonly used data term in conversations on the coronavirus disease and frequently mentioned in government briefings and media headlines and articles. It refers to measures that are meant to isolate people across a region in order to limit the daily or new infections of any disease to a level that can be handled by the local health care systems. The concept suggests slowing down the spread of the virus by introducing non-medical intervention measures like shutting down schools or introducing social distancing norms to ensure that fewer people need hospitalisation at any given point to time, and thus minimise the number of deaths. The curve referred to is the number of active cases (determined by subtracting the deaths and recovered patients from the total infections). This is then overlaid with the health care region’s capacity to show whether the health care system is overburdened (see chart above).One of the most widely accepted predictions based on this concept was prepared by a group of 30 epidemiologists from Imperial College in London, who ran simulation models to get an idea of what impact different forms of non-medical interventions would have on the spread of the disease. When they ran the model on the US and the UK, they found that the two countries were looking at around 2.2 million and half-a-million deaths, respectively, in the absence of any government intervention.One of the strategies studied by the model was mitigation, wherein people who are suspected to have been infected or exposed to Sars-CoV-2 would be quarantined. However, they saw that even then, hundreds of thousands of deaths were likely. So they suggested a more extreme strategy termed suppression, under which everyone would be required to remain socially distant, which they said would save millions of lives. This meant shutting down all spots of public interaction such as schools, universities, and markets and quarantine of anyone who tests positive, along with friends and families.Doubling rate The doubling rate is one of the Covid-19 data terms that has been introduced in the daily lexicon because it is so commonly used by the both the Central and state governments in daily media briefings. Loosely explained, it is the duration in which any number — for instance the fatality rate — doubles and is generally used to calculate exponential growth such as population rates, inflation and compound interest.Although a precise calculation is complex, an approximate doubling rate can be calculated by using the “rule of 72,” wherein you divide 72 by the growth percentage and the result is an estimated doubling rate in periods. In terms of the coronavirus pandemic, the doubling rate refers to the number of days it would take for any region to double its case or death count. So if there were 1,000 cases in a region on a particular day and the doubling rate at the time was five days, it would mean that the cases would touch 2,000 five days later (average daily increase of 14.9%).On March 25, when the lockdown started, the doubling time cases in India based on the previous week’s rate of new cases was 3.4 days. Since then, it has increased to 18.3 days on June 13.One shortcoming of comparing the doubling rates is that it may not truly reflect the volume of cases that are looming. For instance, when the doubling rate was 3.4 days on March 25 (see chart), we were adding around 150 cases a day. While the doubling rate is more than five times to 18.3 on June 13, the caseload now is now more than 320,000, which means that we are adding 12,500 cases every day. Comparing outbreaksTo account for the exponential nature of a pandemic in which cases multiply, instead of increasing in a linear manner, data analysts look at charts in a “logarithmic scale,” which makes changes in rates of case growth more prominent. This provides an avenue to compare rates of change between regions with vastly different caseloads.A key characteristic of the chart is that the Y-axis (vertical axis) is plotted in a logarithmic scale which enables us to display data over a very wide range in a compact way.In order to keep comparisons uniform, this chart takes Day 1 as the first day more than 500 cases were reported (see chart). Thus, we can compare countries going through advanced stages (such as the US) to countries that started reporting cases far later (India, Brazil) even though they may have a vast difference in the number of cases or deaths.Hammer and DanceThis analysis was made famous by Silicon Valley businessman Tomas Pueyo, who argued that the world needs to crackdown hard in a strategy that can be likened to a “hammer and dance” approach – with a first intense “hammer” move to stop the outbreak from growing followed by a sustained “dance” of lighter measures to contain the virus until a vaccine is found.The analysis, posted on blogging website Medium in March, takes into account several projections and infection trends that show how the spread of the disease can be interrupted by containment efforts such as social distancing. If governments fight hard at the start, they will curb deaths and relieve hospitals.During the Hammer phase, the goal is to get R number (the reproduction number) as close to zero, as fast as possible, he wrote. The idea is to fight the spread of the disease with the most intense of measures right when it starts spreading so once it moves to the Dance phase, restrictions can be removed and applied as needed in order to keep R number as close to 1 as possible, wrote Pueyo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/data-takes-centre-stage-in-virus-ravaged-world/story-nPrP9emFmakxMnVGytnkBK.html
15-06-2020||India||Pradhan promises aid to Assam gas blowout victims||Union Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday said people affected in Oil India’s Baghjan gas well tragedy will be “adequately” compensated.Pradhan reached Assam on Saturday to review the situation arising after a blowout and successive inferno that killed two persons. Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who accompanied Pradhan to the disaster site and relief camps , said a model and a veterinary hospital, a higher secondary school and a skill development centre will be set up in Baghjan. “Today I announce that the Baghajan embankment will be constructed at a cost of ₹27 crore,” he said.“We will compensate all the affected people. Tea gardens, betel nut trees, fishes, houses and any other properties that have been damaged will be compensated in consultation with the Assam government,” Pradhan told people in a relief camp.After visiting the well site, the Union minister said the Centre and the state are trying for a permanent solution. “Oil India is an Assamese company. It has been working here for many decades. We will punish the culprit for this disaster even if he is a powerful man,” Pradhan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pradhan-promises-aid-to-assam-gas-blowout-victims/story-frbRS4uiKBEFNuEI77cVtK.html
15-06-2020||India||‘Radical change in Jammu-Kashmir over five years’: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said Jammu & Kashmir will witness a radical change in terms of development over the next five years and that people of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) will be envious and will seek to live with India. “The day it happens, our unanimous resolution of Parliament will also be fulfilled,” he said at a virtual rally focussed on Jammu & Kashmir. Singh was referring to the February 1994 resolution that said the entire erstwhile state of Jammu & Kashmir, including PoK, are India’s integral part and asked Pakistan vacate the areas of the region it has occupied through aggression.Singh called Constitution’s Article 370, which was nullified last year , an “old stain”.Singh said the weather has changed and Pakistan is feeling the heat. “Our channels are now showing temperatures of Muzaffarabad and Gilgit [PoK]. ...Therefore, there is now more mischief but our security forces and agencies are giving them a befitting reply. Terrorists are being killed in large numbers...”In its response, the Pakistan Foreign Office rejected Singh’s remarks about the situation in J&K, while it described the Article 370 move as “illegal and unilateral” and said subsequent steps showed “that the primary motivation remains the disempowerment and disenfranchisement of the Kashmiri people…”Pakistan alleged that Singh’s statements were a “desperate attempt” to divert attention and accused India of “human rights violations”.Singh also questioned arch-rival Congress’s “discreet silence” over the nullification of Article 370. Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill said, “At this juncture, defence minister rather than narrating poetry should explain the reality of 75% jump in Incursion by China at LAC and why till date China has not retreated from Pangong Tso.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/radical-change-in-jammu-kashmir-over-five-years-rajnath-singh/story-hkLfmPMxMlpYPvNmjV3dOL.html
15-06-2020||India||India no longer weak, will not compromise on pride: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said India and China want to resolve the stand-off between their border troops through dialogue even as he underlined that his government will never compromise when it comes to national pride. India is no longer a weak nation, he added. “Many people including the opposition have raised questions. From time to time, information is being given to the people... military-level talks are on to resolve the dispute,” he said at a virtual rally focussed on Jammu & Kashmir. “China wants resolution via talks and India also wants to resolve this tussle through diplomatic and military talks.”Singh said his government would divulge everything at an appropriate time. “For now, I can say with confidence and conviction that we can never make any compromise with our national pride. India is not a weak nation anymore. Our power has increased manifold,” said Singh, who was on Friday briefed about the standoff and the status of the military-level dialogue.Singh’s comments came a day after army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said disengagement of Indian and Chinese forces is taking place in a “phased manner” along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) and the situation there is “under control”. The disengagement comes even as India and China continue diplomatic and military engagements for a resolution of the stand-off.Indian and Chinese army delegations met on Friday for the fifth time in eastern Ladakh for talks to resolve the stand-off that began with a violent confrontation between patrols of the two countries near Ladakh’s Pangong Tso on May 5. Another confrontation later followed in Sikkim. The confrontations triggered a military build-up on both sides of the LAC that stretched from Ladakh to Uttarakhand, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh.Singh said India is strengthening its forces to secure the country and not to scare anyone. He referred to US president Donald Trump’s invite this month to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend the G7 summit of seven major countries and called it an example of India’s growing popularity and power.He insisted India is in secure hands. “The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] government appointed the [country’s first] chief of defence staff [last year] without wasting any time. The issue of national security was hanging fire for the past 15 to 20 years,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-no-longer-weak-will-not-compromise-on-pride-rajnath-singh/story-P71CXuX1Akg7gU9ud32KPM.html
15-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||When will the coronavirus disease peak in India? That’s the Rs 20-lakh crore question.Some experts have said the disease is expected to peak in India in July. There’s a study funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research that is doing the rounds that expects the peak to happen in November.But I think we are asking the wrong question.Infections caused by the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes the coronavirus disease largely appear in concentrated clusters (at least, that’s been the trend everywhere in the world), which may make it pointless to try and answer the original question at the country-level for a nation as large as India. A better way of framing the question would be — when will the coronavirus disease peak in Delhi? Or Chennai? Or Mumbai? Or Ahmedabad? Or even Indore? Around the world, people have measured this simply by looking at the number of daily infections and deaths. At some stage — and this has happened in China’s Wuhan; Italy; Spain; even New York City — the numbers of daily cases and daily deaths start to decline consistently. It doesn’t just happen for a day or two but dips steadily and consistently over time.The bad news for Indian cities and states being ravaged by the coronavirus right now is that the trend line is still pointing north — not due north (that would be alarming), but north all the same. The numbers of new cases and deaths continue to rise, and, worryingly, so does the positivity rate, the proportion of those testing positive. And at least in these states and cities, no matter what anyone claims, there is clear community transmission (which actually isn’t that big a deal; many of the countries that have flattened the curve did see community transmission). Events over the weekend indicate that India is clearly stepping up its response to the pandemic but it would still help to know when the disease will peak across states and cities. At one level, this can help administrators plan ahead. At another, it gives everyone something to look forward to. An infection wanes under two conditions: it has run its course (which means enough of the population has been exposed to the pathogen and is, therefore, immune); or its chain has been broken either through a cure (or a vaccine), or by physically removing chances of an infection. For instance, across Europe, especially Western Europe, which was ravaged by the disease, the trend lines of daily cases all indicate a clear decline (even in the UK, which saw 1,425 new cases on June 13, well off its peak of 6,000-plus).Now, did this happen because the virus ran its course? Limited blood tests of the population in many of these countries do not indicate widespread immunity (it is accepted that 60-65% of the population will have to be infected to achieve what scientists call herd immunity). No country is close to that.Or did it happen simply because these countries managed to break the chain — by testing, tracing, isolating and treating the affected, and by persuading the rest of the population to take adequate precautions (masks, hand-washing, social distancing)? This appears more likely.In effect, the experience of most countries — let’s ignore smaller ones such as New Zealand that have crushed the curve (because they can) — shows that they haven’t worn the virus down; they have just managed to learn to live with it, minimising both infections and deaths as they wait for a possible cure.The 68-day lockdown in India may have deferred the peak, giving time for governments to strengthen their health care infrastructure but if the cases in India are continuing to rise rise (the country saw 12,081 new cases on Saturday, and 11,423 on Sunday), it’s because we have not done a good enough job of testing, tracing, and isolating the infected. And it’s because at least some of us have been lax in taking precautions. The country now seems to be stepping up its game on the first. People now have to step up theirs on the second.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-znYKpjv5CkyR6uTPwxeJnL.html
15-06-2020||India||23 journalists test positive for Covid-19 in Telangana, state registers 237 new cases||Twenty three journalists tested positive for Covid-19 in Telangana on Sunday, taking the count of journalists’ testing positive for the infectious disease to 60 in the state, the Telangana health minister’s office said. So far, at least one journalist has succumbed to the deadly virus in Telangana, the minister’s office saidEarlier on June 7, a 33-year-old journalist who worked as a crime reporter for a popular Telugu television news channel in Hyderabad succumbed to the Covid-19 infection, doctors at Gandhi Hospital where he had been admitted had announced. He was the first journalist in Telangana to fall prey to the dreaded coronavirus.ALSO READ | After High Court’s direction, Telangana to test 50,000 people for Covid-19According to Gandhi Hospital Superintendent Dr Raja Rao, the journalist was already suffering from Myasthenia Gravis, in which all the muscles including respiratory muscles were weak for which he had been undergoing treatment. With this co-morbid condition, he contracted Covid-19 and developed bilateral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A team of doctors tried to treat him. But, he had a cardiac arrest and could not be revived. Telangana on Sunday reported 237 new Covid-19 cases and three deaths, taking the total number of coronavirus cases in the state to 4,974.There are 2,412 active coronavirus cases currently and at least 2,377 people have recovered from the disease and been discharged.With the 3 deaths, the death toll in the state has now risen to 185, the state health department said.Among the total Covid-19 positive cases reported in Telangana, 449 are migrant workers who have returned from other states after the lockdown was lifted and also includes foreign returnees and deportees, the health department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/23-journalists-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-telangana-state-registers-237-new-cases/story-KbGaBZ79SdlkkkslhvoinJ.html
15-06-2020||India||Capital to double tests in two days, treble them in six: Amit Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah held two separate meetings with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Sunday, announcing a series of steps, including aggressive testing and the formation of two committees, aimed at augmenting health care infrastructure , possibly capping treatment costs in private hospitals, and effective containment of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the national capital.Shah, who will hold an all-party meeting on Monday for further assessment of the pandemic situation in the Capital, also announced a comprehensive door-to-door survey in containment zones for contact tracing and promised the city 500 railway coaches having a capacity of 8,000 beds to treat Covid-19 patients to mitigate any possible shortage of beds.The meetings come amidst a wave of cases in the Capital. Delhi recorded 2,224 cases on Sunday, the third consecutive day it has seen more than 2,000 new infections. It ended Sunday with 41,182 infections (24,032 of them active) and 1,327 deaths. From Monday (June 8) to Sunday, the city has registered 12,246 cases. In the previous week (June 1-7), it recorded 9,092 cases. The number of containment zones in the city, meanwhile, rose from 147 on June 1 to 219 on Sunday.“To prevent the coronavirus infection in Delhi, testing will be doubled in the next two days, and after six days the testing will be increased to three times...Also, after a few days, testing will be started at every polling station in the containment zones,” Shah said in a series of tweets in Hindi after the first meeting. It was also attended by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, officials of the home and health ministries and the Delhi Disaster Management Authority.According to the Delhi government’s recent submission in the high court, the combined daily testing capacity of 40 labs — 17 public and 23 private — is 8,600 per day. However, from June 8-13 the city conducted just 5,525 tests per day. Delhi’s per million testing figure stands at 14,666, more than three times the national average of 4,245. An HT report published on June 6 said the regions where testing is significantly higher than the national average --- such as Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu -- are also the ones with significantly higher infections and deaths, especially when populations are factored in.Shah also asked private hospitals to earmark 60% of beds allotted for Covid-19 patients at a cheaper rate, a move that came against the backdrop of allegations that such health facilities were charging patients exorbitant fees. A key decision taken on Sunday was the formation of a committee under the chairmanship of Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul. It will give its report on Monday on ensuring reservation of the 60% beds and fix rates of testing and treatment.Based on decisions taken at the meeting , the Union ministry of health announced in the evening that it has set up three teams of four doctors each to inspect all major dedicated Covid-19 facilities in the state and suggest improvements. And All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) announced the creation of a 24x7 helpline in Hindi and English (9115444155), using which callers can avail out-patient appointments or talk to volunteers. The helpline is also open to doctors who will be connected to consultants. A focal point of Delhi’s Covid-19 strategy has been health care infrastructure. With Kejriwal fearing that the state might need 150,000 beds by the end of July, his government has zeroed in on 77 banquet halls and 40 hotels to add nearly 16,000 beds to the existing capacity of 9,698 beds across government and private hospitals in the city. Another side of the debate that has come to the fore is the quality of health services. Two days ago, the Supreme Court termed the condition of Delhi’s Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital as “pathetic” and its wards as “deplorable”, though the government said it was trying its best to provide quality services.Amidst a flurry of activities on Sunday, the Centre also transferred four senior Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers --- Awanish Kumar and Monica Priyadarshini from Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Gaurav Singh Rajawat and Vikram Singh Mallik from Arunachal Pradesh --- to help the city-state manage the Covid-19 situation. The government also directed the attachment of two senior IAS officers – SCL Das and SS Yadav -- from the Centre to Delhi.After the morning meeting, Shah announced that the Centre promised to provide the Delhi government with necessary resources such as oxygen cylinders, ventilators and pulse oximeters, among others. He also said the Centre will issue fresh guidelines on the last rites for Covid-19 victims with an aim to reduce the waiting time for cremations. Later in the day, the health ministry followed up and said bodies of all those suspected to have died of Covid-19 would be “handed over to relatives immediately” without waiting for confirmation. The bodies would be “disposed with precautions,” it added. For efficient monitoring in containment zones, every individual will be asked to download the Aarogya Setu app, Shah said.People familiar with the developments said Kejriwal agreed to all steps proposed by Shah during the one-and-a-half-hour meeting in the morning. “Extremely productive meeting between Delhi government and Central government. Many key decisions taken. We will fight corona together,” Kejriwal tweeted after the meeting.An Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government spokesperson said: “The meeting between the central government and Delhi government was very productive. All issues related to Delhi’s fight against Covid-19 were discussed in detail and key decisions were jointly taken. The central government and the Delhi government agreed on an immediate action plan to increase capacity of beds, increase testing and other important initiatives. This pandemic is among the worst to have happened in the history of mankind and it is imperative for all of us to come together to fight this pandemic.”In the second meeting in the afternoon, the mayors of Delhi’s three municipal corporations were present alongside Shah, Kejriwal, Vardhan, and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Dr Randeep Guleria.“We have to turn the country and the national capital Corona free, healthy and prosperous at the earliest under the leadership of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Shah said, according to a press statement by the Centre. “This will be possible with the cooperation and coordination of all concerned,” he added. Shah also asked the Delhi government and all concerned departments to ensure proper implementation of the decisions.At the meeting, the three civic bodies offered to give their community centres, hospitals and schools to the Delhi government for use. “We have extended full support and cooperation to the Delhi government in fight this pandemic. There are other hospitals and our staff is working hard to provide best possible care,” North corporation mayor Avtar Singh said. The three civic bodies are governed by the BJP. In a related development, a statement from the home minister’s office said Shah called an all-party meeting to review the Covid-19 health crisis in the national capital. The meeting will take place at North Block at 11am on Monday. The Congress, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the AAP and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have been asked to be present alongside top state and central officials.When asked about the all-party meeting, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said he will raise issues related to Covid-19 testing. “There is a need to increase testing to contain the disease. We also need to upgrade our facility so that people can be under medical supervision,” he said.Commenting on the decisions taken on Sunday, Dr Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine, Safdarjung Hospital, said door-to-door survey was the most effective way of identifying cases early. “However, people going door-to-door need to be adequately trained in interacting with common people as community participation is a must during outbreak situations for effective implementation of containment strategies. Half the battle is won if you win the faith of people,” he said.(with inputs from Risha Chitlangia in Delhi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/capital-to-double-tests-in-two-days-treble-them-in-six-shah/story-OhI6vA7ArxrbauYJg5ItWP.html
15-06-2020||India||13% more sowing points to a bumper kharif crop||Farmers have planted kharif or summer-sown crops, which account for half of India’s annual food output, on 9.3 million hectares – 13.2% higher than last year’s level for this time of the year – in an indication that the agriculture sector has largely escaped the impact of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak so far.The area sown is a critical gauge of the progress of cultivation, which depends on availability of inputs, such as fertilisers, seeds and pesticides, apart from weather. A larger sown area, aided by good weather, is an early sign of ample harvests.Timely onset and a steady advance of the monsoon have resulted in increasing summer acreage. A good south-west monsoon is critical because nearly 60% of India’s summer-sown area is dependent on rains because of lack of irrigation and the farm sector employs nearly half of the country’s workforce.Latest data from the agriculture ministry showed that farmers have sown pulses in 0.2 million hectares on June 13, 44.3% higher than sowing completed during the corresponding period last year. The acreage under oilseeds stood at 0.4 million hectares. Among cereals, sowing of the main summer staple, rice, was higher by 15.5% at 0.6 million hectares. Coarse cereals saw a 41.2% spike in sowing compared to the corresponding period last year.The areas under cash crops have also seen increases. The area under cotton is up 23.4% at 1.9 million hectare currently. Farmers have also sown sugarcane on 4.8 million hectares, which is 1.3% higher than last year.The monsoon so far has been surplus by 31%, India Meteorological Department’s data till June 14 shows. The rain-bearing system has pushed into central Arabian sea, some parts of north-east Arabian sea, Gujarat, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Maharashtra, including Mumbai, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and partially into Bihar and Madhya Pradesh, progressing robustly, according to an IMD bulletin on Sunday. A normal monsoon will lessen the strain on the agriculture economy from widespread disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, analysts say.Plentiful harvests are key to rural incomes and keeping the lid on inflation. Agricultural incomes push up rural demand for goods and services in the larger economy; this keeps the manufacturing going. For instance, in a good crop year, nearly half of all motorcycles are sold in rural areas, according to Citibank Research.Agriculture has so far escaped the impact of the pandemic, largely due to sufficient rains and uninterrupted markets for seeds and fertilisers, which were exempt from the lockdown. The farm sector is poised to grow at least 3% in 2020-21, despite the pandemic, according to the state-run think tank Niti Aayog’s assessment in April. There are other indicators of an uptick, such as higher sales of fertilisers. According to data from the fertilisers ministry, fertiliser sales stood at 4 million tonne in May 2020, which is twice the total sale of about 2 million tonne during May 2019.“The monsoon has advanced well. Rainfall has been good. Moreover, it seems water availability has not been a problem anywhere, resulting in good acreages,” said RS Mani, an economist with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/13-more-sowing-points-to-a-bumper-kharif-crop/story-n3hP6iFEnobnNbfLkEB95K.html
15-06-2020||India||Clear method for data collection must, says BN Srikrishna||India’s legal framework on personal data protection should ensure that the purpose for which data is collected is clearly explained and it should lay down a clear methodology for procuring data, retired Supreme Court justice BN Srikrishna said on Sunday.When data is collected without the consent of the individual, like in the current circumstances where a lot of data is being collected in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic, the law should ensure data anonymisation, he added“Under what circumstances can data be taken away without consent of the principal? Take for instance, the situation of Covid. Data is necessary for statistical probability. If someone wants to do research on impact of Covid, they will need a lot of data on it. This is where the aspect of “data anonymisation” comes in, where only numbers and no personal information can be utilized”, Srikrishna pointed out.He was speaking at a Webinar organized by law firm Shyam Padman Associates on the topic “The Challenges in Personal Data Protection in the absence of (a) Data Protection Law in India”.Srikrishna, who headed the committee which, in 2018, proposed the draft of the Personal Data Protection Bill said that the line between right to privacy of an individual and the right of the state to access data is a fine one and the data protection law should guarantee that data collected is only to the extent to which it is required.“The legislative enactment must categorically explain the purpose for the collection of data. There should be a rational connection (between the data collected and the purpose for which it is acquired). There should be no absurdity in the connection. There is also the need for proportionality. The law should not go beyond what is absolutely required”, he explained.The state, he said, can take away rights of an individual, only if it can ensure that it is for the greater good of the public.“For instance, in the case of Aarogya Setu, the state, in a positive move, did not make it mandatory”, Srikrishna said, referring to India’s contact tracing app. The central government came out with a draft Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill in December 2019. The bill regulates personal data of individuals and governs the processing of such data by both government and companies incorporated in India.Justice Srikrishna said the bill falls short on certain aspects including absence of data localization which enables transfer of data outside India . “Can the State can access data of a person who is a suspect. The answer in the legislation is yes. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the PDP of 2019 has watered down this provision which allows the state to unilaterally infringe the fundamental right (of privacy) in the name of sovereignty and security”, he said while expressing hope that the Supreme Court will look into such aspects if the data protection law is challenged.The Supreme Court’s seminal 2017 judgment in the case of Justice KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India in which the court had held right to privacy as a facet of the fundamental right to life was instrumental in initiating debate on the absence of data protection laws in India.“The SC asked, ‘Where is the law on Data Protection?’ And everyone started looking at each other, with no clue about this. It is then the committee on the formulation of a Personal Data Protection Bill was founded”, Srikrishna said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clear-method-for-data-collection-must-bn-srikrishna/story-sIgkJwWdapfVdm8hdLllIN.html
15-06-2020||India||Wildlife board calls for study on impact of sand mining in Uttarakhand||The National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) has raised concerns about extensive sand and boulder mining projects in Uttarakhand and their impact on river ecology and wildlife. As per the minutes of an NBWL meeting on June 11, it has recommended a study of the cumulative impact of the mining for consideration of future projects.There are over 100 sand mining leases operational in the state, according to its geology and mining department. NBWL had received three proposals for sand mining along the Asan Wetland Conservation Reserve and five along the Rajaji National Park’s boundary near Haridwar.NBWL considered the five proposals for the collection of sand, sand gravel (bajri) and boulders in the private lands located 1.5 to 9 km from the boundary thrice. But it decided against clearing the projects until they complied with Union environment ministry’s Sustainable Sand Mining Management Guidelines, 2016, and the National Tiger Conservation Authority’s conditions.“Few proposals may not have serious impact on ecology, ground water recharge and wildlife disturbance, but when several dozen miners work in the river beds around the Park, and hundreds may be thousands of trucks move every day for transport of the material, the anthropogenic pressure and ecological degradation would be serious,” said HS Singh, member NBWL, according to the minutes.The environment ministry’s Forest Advisory Committee has deferred the renewal of forest clearance for mining of minor minerals from 64 ha of forest land along river Song in Mussoorie forest division that Uttarakhand Forest Development Corporation had applied for. “The state government shall conduct a study to ascertain the impact of mining in upstream and downstream. The study shall come out with clear recommendations as how such mining is useful in maintaining the natural flow of the river and health of adjoining forests. It should cover the impact of mining in the area for last ten years. The study may correlate satellite imagery of last ten years,” FAC observed. It added the government should also quantify how much sand and boulder can be mined annually.According to the corporation, there are 10 leases that are being worked now, four on the Gaula river, the rest on Kosi, Dapka and Nandhaur, Sharda, Malan and Kotawali rivers. “Our permit for mining on Rawasan river expired in March. We have requested NBWL to grant us permission to mine on Rawasan for a few more months until we can renew the clearance. We also have forest clearances to mine sand on the Ganga and its other tributaries but we some court cases are pending against them,” said Monish Mullick, the Corporation’s managing director.Dinesh Kumar, deputy director, geology and mining, Uttarakhand, said they do not do any mechanised mining. “There are very few in wildlife dominated areas. We will not proceed on those without NBWL nod.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wildlife-board-calls-for-study-on-impact-of-sand-mining-in-u-khand/story-BZVSUqRi4wBOAzQtGgQBCL.html

Senior BJP leader and Union home minister Amit Shah recently addressed a virtual rally to launch the party’s Bihar election strategy.The other smaller constituents of the mahagathbandhan or grand alliance, too, have demanded clarity on the issues of leadership and distribution of seats, a Congress functionary said on condition of anonymity.The RJD has sought to project Tejashwi Yadav as the chief ministerial candidate of the grand alliance, but Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) chief and former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi is against the move and has flagged lack of consultation in the opposition grouping.Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) chief Upendra Kushwaha and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) president Mukesh Sahani have demanded the formation of a coordination committee to sort out the differences in the mahagathbandhan. Kushwaha and Sahni made the demand after meeting twice last week.Bihar Congress leaders, too, want the party high command to initiate steps to spell out the future course of action vis-à-vis the alliance, letters written by regional leaders and reviewed by HT show.In their communications to the central leadership, state Congress leaders have expressed concern over the opposition having ceded its space in the midst of the coronavirus disease outbreak despite what they describe as the “failure” of the ruling coalition in containing the pandemic coupled with “massive anti-incumbency” against the government.They also pointed out to repeated jibes taken at Tejashwi Yadav by the ruling JD(U)-BJP leaders for his absence from the state after the outbreak of Covid-19.In his series of letters to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, senior party leader Kishore Kumar Jha urged him to hold a virtual rally and target the JD(U)-BJP combine for their handling of the migrant workers crisis.He also requested Gandhi to direct the state leaders to step out of the party’s Sadaqat Ashram headquarters in Patna and reach out to the masses across Bihar.The Congress has identified 60-70 of the total 243 seats where it is in a position to give a tough fight or even register a win against the ruling alliance, a senior leader overseeing party affairs said, asking not to be named.However, it remains to be seen if the RJD and other constituents are willing to agree to the Congress party’s demand for an increase in the number of seats over the ones it contested in the 2015 assembly elections.The Congress then contested on 41 seats and won 27. The JD(U), which was then a part of the grand alliance, and the RJD fought 101 seats each. While the RJD won 80 seats, the JD(U) won 71 and the BJP’s tally stood at 53.JD(U) leader and chief minister Nitish Kumar later exited the grand alliance and once again joined hands with the BJP to form a coalition government in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-seeks-early-end-to-bihar-alliance-woes/story-O9wznZToOtPCI3MNbR4EcO.html
15-06-2020||India||Extreme weather events in India on the rise||By the end of the 21st century, the number of warm days and warm nights in India is likely to be 55-70% higher compared to the average number between 1976 and 2005, according to the worst climate change scenario listed in the country’s first national climate change assessment by the ministry of earth sciences.And the frequency of summer heat waves is likely to be three to four times higher and their duration, likely to double .The report, to be released on Tuesday said that in the 29 years from 1986 to 2015, India has recorded several weather extremes --- such as an increase in warm days and nights and a rise in extremely severe cyclonic storms over the Arabian Sea --- that were a result of human-caused climate change. Rapid changes in India’s climate will put stress on ecosystems, agricultural output and freshwater resources, and also cause damage to infrastructure, the report, available on publishing platform Springer and seen by HT, added.“These portend serious consequences for the country’s biodiversity, food, water and energy security, and public health…higher temperatures, extreme weather events, and higher climate variability have been associated with an elevated risk of heat strokes, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, and stress-related disorders,” the report said. Under all climate change scenarios, the extremes will only intensify. For example, temperatures of the warmest day and the coldest night of the year increased by 0.63 degree Celsius and 0.4 degree Celsius, respectively, in the 29-year period.“India has witnessed a rise in average temperature; a decrease in monsoon precipitation; a rise in extreme temperature and rainfall events, droughts, and sea levels; and an increase in the intensity of severe cyclones, alongside other changes in the monsoon system. There is compelling scientific evidence that human activities have influenced these changes in regional climate,” the report, drafted by scientists from Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology said.The number of warm days have increased by about 9.9 per decade and warm nights by 7.7 per decade, the report said. Cold nights have decreased by 3.3 per decade during this period. Warm days or nights are those when maximum and minimum temperatures are over the 90th percentile.“Heat action plans need to be further developed and calibrated. We need to track what kind of changes in health impacts we are seeing…In the long term, our infrastructure needs to be heat-resistant or mortality will increase; cool roofs, efficient cooling should be a part of policy,” said Dr Dileep Mavalankar, director, Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar, Gujarat.India’s average temperature has risen by around 0.7 degree Celsius during 1901–2018, which may not reflect these extremes. The largest increase in the annual mean temperature of more than 0.2 degree Celsius per decade was observed in some areas of north India between 1986 and 2015. The warming is much weaker in the southern peninsula.With increase in air temperature, sea surface temperature over the Indian Ocean has already risen abnormally by 1 degree Celsius in the 64 years between 1951 and 2015 compared to the global average sea surface warming of 0.7 degree Celsius. The frequency of extremely severe cyclonic storms (ESCS) over the Arabian Sea has increased during the post-monsoon seasons of 1998–2018. Most models are projecting a higher sea surface warming in the Arabian Sea than the Bay of Bengal. Oxygen concentrations and marine phytoplankton have declined in the recent decades.“It’s a first for India. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change produces such reports for global impact assessment. This national report can help policymakers in different sectors specially health and agriculture. We plan to do this review every four to five years,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, the ministry of earth sciences.The report has also underlined that climate change has already skewed the monsoon patterns with rains decreasing by 6% between 1951 and 2015. The Indo-Gangetic Plains and Western Ghats have recorded the highest declines, but the frequency of extreme rainfall (over 150 mm) has increased by 75% between 1950 and 2015 in central India. There is a shift towards more frequent dry spells (27% higher than the 1951-1980 period) and more intense wet spells during the summer monsoon season. High elevations of the Tibetan Plateau recorded severe warming as high as 0.5 degree Celsius per decade, according to the report.The projections in the assessment report are based on the climate models used in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and climate change modeling studies using the IITM Earth System Model (ESM) and CORDEX South Asia datasets.The report has warned of a cascade of climate-related hazards, which will overlap. For instance, a region may experience an abnormally long or intense summer heat wave followed by intense monsoon floods that alternate with lengthening dry spells.“Low-lying coastal zones, especially on India’s east coast, may witness rising sea levels damaging property and increasing groundwater salinity. A rise in cyclone intensities will likely result in increasing inundation from the accompanying storm surges that turn proximate agricultural lands and lakes saline, and imperil wildlife,” the report added.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) released on Sunday a detailed report on Super Cyclone Amphan, which devastated parts of Sunderbans after it made landfall on May 20. The IMD report said tidal waves as high as 15 feet or around 5 metres inundated low-lying areas of the islands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/extreme-weather-events-on-the-rise/story-6fUAeJnnibsb0ExziRk5BK.html
15-06-2020||India||8 week lockdown led to India pushing coronavirus peak to November: Study||The eight-week lockdown in India shifts the peak of the epidemic by 34-76 days and reduces the number of cases at the end of the lockdown by 69-97% , a new pre-print study by academics at the Department of Community Medicine and School of Public health at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Research and Education and Research, Chandigarh, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, ICMR, New Delhi claimed. India imposed a lockdown that was nearly 10 weeks long and some of the restrictions are still in place (although many have been eased). The study, which is yet to be peer reviewed also claimed that “intensification of public health surveillance measures with 60% effectiveness” would reduce the number of cases at the peak by 70% and cumulatively by 26.6%. Such measures would also reduce the requirement for ICU beds and ventilators by 83%, the study added. Interestingly, the study puts the cost of managing Covid-19 at India at 4.5% of GDP in the absence of any “intervention” and 6.2% with “intensified public health measures.” The study was based on a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (or SERI) model. Worryingly, the study said that India’s health care infrastructure may prove inadequate later this year with the demand for isolation and ICU beds and ventilators exceeding supply in November even with “intensified public health measures with 60% effectiveness.” The study was funded by ICMR. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-delayed-covid-peak-study/story-uPZZuCOJoI3K87FAKZ1bxM.html
15-06-2020||India||Plan to reimburse data usage in work-from-home hits hurdle||The Union finance ministry’s expenditure department has for now opposed a proposal for Rs 300 monthly reimbursement for increased data usage for officials working from home, saying it is unnecessary since remote working saves the travelling costs, officials aware of the matter said.The proposal has been made as part of deliberations for the formulation of the Centre’s work from home policy. The policy is being drafted in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic that has prompted social distancing norms and remote working globally to check its spread.An official in ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions familiar with the developments, said the the Department felt the proposed reimbursement “unnecessary” in its feedback last week. “The feeling is that since officials have to bear less travel costs, data usage reimbursement is not necessary at this point,” said one of the officials on condition of anonymity.An expenditure department official, who did not wish to be named, said there is no question of such reimbursement as officials are paid for travel and other costs. The official added that the no formal proposal has been made as yet, although officials from other departments confirmed that it has been debated. The department of administrative reforms and public grievances (DARPG), which is drafting the work from home guidelines, has held at least 35 meetings with representatives of over 80 ministries and departments over the last month to seek their feedback. The proposal for the monthly compensation for data usage has been discussed at the meetings.Extending virtual private network (VPN) access to officers below the secretary level, creation of a cloud large enough to store all the information, and providing support like laptops are among other suggestions DAPG has received apart from the one for the data usage reimbursement. Officers above the rank of deputy secretary were allowed VPN access in 2019.A VPN works usually through the internet and connects remote users to an organisation’s network.A third official said they have sought VPN access for nearly 20,000 officials. “At present, nearly 3,000 officials have the access,” the official said on condition of anonymity.The Union electronics, information and technology ministry has also recommended that eOffice, the fulcrum of the government’s functioning during the Covid-19 lockdown, be used for routine files for now.“Bulk procurement of laptops is also being debated,” said the second official from the personnel, pensions and grievances ministry. “Another key aspect is access to sensitive files [for] which the ministry of home affairs is yet to take a call on.”The above-mentioned DAPRG official said a work from home policy was definitely on the cards but the only question remains whether it will be a liberal or a slightly restricted one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plan-to-reimburse-data-usage-in-work-from-home-hits-hurdle/story-wA1J94wbT1YSkBJi5PQ6AP.html
15-06-2020||India||Indore cop, SDM who knelt down to talk to Congress MLAs shunted out||The Madhya Pradesh government late Saturday night transferred a sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) and a city superintendent of police (CSP) from Indore hours to Bhopal after they knelt down to talk to Congress MLAs including a former minister to talk to and persuade them to withdraw their agitation.A photo of the SDM Rakesh Sharma and CSP DK Tiwari talking to Congress MLA and ex-minister Jitu Patwari while the latter along with another Congress MLA Sanjay Shukla and two other Congress leaders was staging a sit-in at Rajwada went viral on social media prompting the ruling party leaders in Indore to question the conduct of the officers and demanding action against them.The Congress MLAs were demanding lodging of an FIR against ex-MLA from BJP Sudarshan Gupta for his organising a programme without the district administration’s permission to celebrate Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s birthday on Friday.A huge crowd turned up to receive food grains from Gupta at the programme as the latter had announced leading to a chaotic situation and social distancing norms thrown to the wind. There was even loot of food grains packets by a number of people.District collector, Indore Manish Singh served a notice to Sharma as to ‘why a disciplinary action be not taken against him for compromising with dignity of a magistrate’. However, within hours of the notice Sharma was transferred from Indore to the state secretariat ‘with immediate effect on administrative ground’. The CSP DK Tiwari too was transferred from Indore to police headquarters at Bhopal ‘with immediate effect’, as per the show cause notice and the transfer orders.State Congress leader KK Mishra said, “The BJP government exposed its parochial view by transferring the officers. This is a politically motivated decision causing injustice to officers who were discharging their duties by persuading public representatives to withdraw their agitation.”State Congress president’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja said, “Congress was in power for 15 months since December 2018 but it never showed any political bias. Those who were staging the sit-in are public representatives. Did the officers commit any mistake by showing respect to public representatives?”Chief secretary Iqbal Singh Bains and director general of police (DGP) Vivek Johri could not be reached for their comments. They did not take phone calls and did not respond to text messages.State BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal brushed aside the Congress’ objections. “The government is empowered to take decisions on transfers of officers on administrative grounds. It will be better if the Congress focuses on real issues concerning people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indore-top-cop-sdm-who-knelt-down-to-talk-to-congress-mlas-shunted-out/story-3OeMSiKWwiwRtj1oKBV08M.html

15-06-2020||Editorials||A renewed effort in Delhi||Delhi is in the middle of a crisis. With a surge in cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), an increase in fatality rate, widespread accounts of the struggle to get tested or/and get hospital admissions, and a projection of 532,000 cases by the end of July and the need for 150,000 beds by then, the pandemic has truly come home to the national capital. It was clear that the Delhi government, led by Arvind Kejriwal, needed help. The fact that Delhi is the Capital, there is a unique division of powers that exists between the Centre and the state, and Delhi’s health facilities are used by citizens across the country made it even more essential for the central government to step in. On Sunday, following a meeting of the state disaster management authority, home minister Amit Shah announced a set of much-needed, welcome measures. The testing rate in the Capital will double in the next two days and triple in six days; the Centre will provide 500 railway coaches, which will add another 8,000 beds to Delhi’s health infrastructure; there will be rigorous contact tracing in containment zones; a high-level committee, within two days, will submit a report on rates to be charged by private hospitals for testing and treatment; new guidelines will be framed for funerals to reduce the waiting time for cremations and burials; the Centre will depute five senior officials to help Delhi with the health crisis; a joint team will inspect facilities in all Covid-19 hospitals; and the Centre will provide oxygen cylinders, ventilators, and other health supplies to the Delhi government.Each of these measures is necessary. Ramping up testing is the only way to trace the infected and prevent further transmission. Contact tracing had almost collapsed in the city — and a renewed effort is much-needed. Private hospitals must be more responsible in their fee structures in times of the pandemic and a degree of regulation will help. Delhi needs support from all quarters to enhance hospital facilities and beds. What is inexplicable is why all of this was not done earlier, and why the period of the lockdown was not used better to anticipate the current situation and prepare for it. Belated as these interventions are, it is welcome and the focus must now be on implementing it. It is also important to constantly review Delhi’s battle against Covid-19, and provide additional support if necessary. For the sake of Delhi’s citizens, the Centre and the Delhi government must continue to work together at this moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-renewed-effort-in-delhi/story-oeSTBd4ptbfmSc78K5wnLJ.html
