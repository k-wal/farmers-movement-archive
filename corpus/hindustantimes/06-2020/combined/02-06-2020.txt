02-06-2020||News||Recovery must take into account the climate crisis||As the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) continues to engulf the world, the other big agenda of our time — the climate crisis — has begun to re-emerge from the shadows. The big question, of course, is whether the pandemic will accelerate our quest for a zero-carbon-emission world or will it set us back. The lessons of the virus will not automatically rub-off on the climate crisis agenda unless a set of deliberate, strategic actions are taken. Covid-19 has certainly opened everyone’s eyes to possibilities that can positively impact the climate agenda. Clean, breathable air and the reality of a work-from-home culture are the obvious ones. For manufacturers, shorter supply chains with its lower Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions will become a business continuity imperative. The similarities between Covid-19 and the climate crisis — both in terms of their disruptive impacts on human lives and the economy and their response that emphasises science and the need to build resilience — can also benefit the climate agenda. There are other reasons for optimism. A Standard & Poor’s global report says that during the pandemic, companies such as Microsoft, Royal Dutch Shell, Morgan Stanley, Bank of Montreal and Citibank have made climate-related pledges. A BBC report quoted Frans Timmermans, the chief of the European Commission (EU)’s Green Deal (which commits the EU to net-zero emissions by 2050), as saying that every euro spent on economic recovery measures after the Covid-19 crisis will be linked to the green transitions.However, history and economics provide a counter-narrative. For instance, after the 2008 financial crisis, global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production fell 1.4% in 2009, but with economic stimulus resources disproportionately allocated to polluting industries, emissions rebounded to 5.9% in 2010. The impact of the indefinite postponement of COP- 26, where countries were expected to announce enhancement of their Paris commitments, is still awaited. Big emitters such as China, the US and Brazil have indicated a relaxation on environmental compliances and enforcement. Even as the EU reiterates its commitment to the Green Deal, a few member-countries have publicly sought moratoriums. The negative growth economies of the developed countries will mean less finance available to developing countries to meet their Nationally Determined Contributions, a condition that countries such as India have placed in order to fulfil its own commitments. And historically low oil prices, combined with reported announcements from major oil producers to increase production, will work against the interests of a low-carbon recovery.There is, therefore, reason to believe that a post-Covid low-carbon recovery is neither inevitable nor automatic. Therefore, a set of five actions can and must be taken to enable this to happen. One, nudge governments on to a low-carbon recovery path. Climate champions — NGOs, think tanks, academia, activists around the world — should produce evidence to demonstrate to governments the long-term economic and resilience gains from economic stimulus programmes that prioritise investments in low-carbon pathways. This could include assistance to businesses conditioned on drastic cuts in emissions and financial industry bailouts that require banks to invest less in fossil fuel and more in climate crisis mitigation and resilience efforts. Two, make the climate crisis a people’s campaign. The environmental gains from Covid-19, the renewed faith in science as well as the comparable risks to human life that the climate crisis and Covid-19 represent are good hooks to make it so. This requires converting the incredible scientific evidence that exists on the climate crisis into simple, understandable and actionable messages that individuals and communities, particularly young people, can use to make changes in their own behaviour while influencing businesses and governments in their roles as customers, employees and responsible citizens. Three, strengthen the “business case” for climate efforts. Some of the rub-offs of Covid-19 on climate such as shorter supply changes and reduced business travel are self-evident to companies and will happen. Investors and lenders, who have understood risk better now must see the benefits of pushing for resilience in the companies they fund. Insurers must factor in these risks. All this will incentivise companies to go down a low caron path.Four, build a national consensus on long-term low-carbon strategy. The response to Covid-19 has demonstrated both the need and the possibility for a political consensus, which is critical in a democracy. Climate crisis actors such as think tanks and advocacy groups should work to ensure this momentum is maintained. The development of long-term low greenhouse gas emissions development strategies for India will be a useful instrument to build such a consensus.Five, strengthen international cooperation and institutions. To address the spatial aspects of a global challenge such as the climate crisis, there is a need for a global institution to anchor the process, a role that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) has played for a long time. However, the somewhat tarnished reputation of the World Health Organization during Covid-19, and the rather scattered and private sector-driven search for a vaccine, suggests that strengthening international cooperation and UNFCC and United Nations Environment Programme as institutions is a project that all climate change champions must commit themselves to.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/recovery-must-take-into-account-the-climate-crisis/story-7yJliq19mzpnlBqlYzywGJ.html
02-06-2020||News||How the coronavirus crisis may feed anti-microbial resistance||Developing countries are reeling under the burden of drug-resistant infections. Poor availability and utilisation of diagnostics and compromised infection-control in communities and hospitals result in an overuse of anti-microbials. It contributes to the development of highly-resistant pathogens which are difficult to destroy. It is well-known that diarrhoea and upper respiratory tract infections are usually caused by viruses, but account for more than 60% of anti-microbial prescriptions. With an increasing focus on anti-microbial resistance globally, India has initiated small but important steps to introduce anti-microbial stewardship to rationalise its prescriptions in hospitals.The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic threatens to undermine these efforts, more so in resource-poor settings with fragile health systems. Like most other viral respiratory tract infections, Covid-19 is self-limiting and causes a mild form of the disease in most patients. In the absence of a specific antiviral treatment, patients are prescribed antibiotics in hospitals across the world.Research published in China, Italy and the United Kingdom show that the majority of people hospitalised with Covid-19 infection were given antibiotics despite little evidence of associated bacterial infections. Although there are no published reports from India, anecdotal evidence suggests that bacterial co-infections are infrequent in patients with suspected severe Covid-19 requiring hospitalisation.With labs quickly shifting their focus to Covid-19 and deprioritising cultures/anti-microbial susceptibility testing, evidence of secondary bacterial or fungal infections in Covid-19 patients is limited. Not enough cultures are being sent for confirmation for the presence of secondary bacterial or fungal infections from Covid-19 patients. There is a significant risk to the laboratory staff collecting samples and technicians processing them due to the shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE) and biosafety challenges in the labs.Such concerns have led many hospitals not conducting routine microbiological examination on Covid-19 patients, undermining the diagnosis and treatment of secondary infections. Since it is challenging to distinguish between bacterial or fungal infections and existing viral pneumonia based on clinical symptoms and radiological findings, the microbiological examination will be valuable for diagnosing secondary infections to guide anti-microbial prescription. It’s imperative to strengthen the investigation of secondary infection and/or co-infection in Covid-19 patients at all health facilities without compromising the safety of the laboratory staff.Until there is evidence that Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is associated with bacterial or fungal co-infections, antibiotics should not be prescribed and the patients must be treated symptomatically. Even when antibiotics are prescribed, the narrowest spectrum agent should be prioritised to target the likely pathogens. India has very high resistance rates to some of the broad-spectrum anti-microbials. It is advisable that such antibiotics should be reserved for situations in which the differentiation between the bacterial and viral aetiology is not possible based on clinical symptoms. If symptoms are severe, antibiotics should be prescribed based on local epidemiology and antibiograms (susceptibility of a specific micro-organism to a battery of anti-microbial drugs). If Sars-CoV-2 infection is confirmed, the antibiotic prescription should be reviewed and discontinued, unless there is clear evidence of bacterial co-infection.In the absence of a vaccine and doubts about Sars-CoV-2 immunity, the coronavirus pandemic may last longer than expected. Having better infection control practices are expected to bring down the incidence of hospital-acquired infections. Yet, there will always be a chance that a certain percentage of patients may require anti-microbials to treat secondary infections. The pipeline of new anti-microbials is running dry and no novel antimicrobials are in immediate sight. We will need antimicrobials long after the coronavirus crisis is over.It is, therefore, important to define indications of antibiotic use in Covid-19 patients and follow the principles of anti-microbial stewardship. If indiscriminate prescribing continues, it will compromise the gains the country has made by introducing anti-microbial stewardship in hospital. Treading with caution and using the available anti-microbials judiciously will save us from jeopardising anti-fungal and anti-bacterial treatments after Covid-19 is over.Kamini Walia is the programme officer, anti-microbial resistance, Indian Council of Medical Research.

02-06-2020||News||As the LAC heats up, reading China’s playbook||The stand-off between Indian and Chinese forces at Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh continues with both sides reinforcing their respective positions. While tensions may be reduced through continuing dialogue in mechanisms put in place over the past several years, the key issue is whether Chinese troops agree to vacate the area they have occupied by violating the Line of Actual Control (LAC).China would be content if, after altering the facts on the ground, the stand-off is defused, say by a limited disengagement of a few metres between the troops, leaving most of the encroached territory in Chinese hands. China may agree to vacate the occupied area but expect concessions in return. These could include a halt to border infrastructure development on the Indian side of LAC, even the dismantling of built up structures. In the Doklam stand-off in 2017, the forces of the two sides disengaged. China halted additional road-building activity but continues to consolidate its position in the occupied area. The bottom line — facts on the ground remain altered to China’s advantage although India’s action forestalled further ingress. Therefore, unless India is able to find an effective counter-strategy to this pattern of Chinese behaviour, incidents of the kind we have seen at many points on LAC are not only likely to continue but to intensify.There is another feature to the Chinese playbook. This is evident at the India-China border and in other theatres such as the South China Sea, the Taiwan Straits and the Yellow Sea. Each Chinese action, taken in isolation, may not be regarded as threatening enough to require a strong and countervailing military riposte. Over a period of time, however, a string of such “isolated” incidents add up cumulatively to a significant change in the balance of power on the ground. China’s dominance of the South China Sea, its occupation and militarisation of several offshore islands, have reached a point where only a major military offensive, perhaps even war, may be necessary to reverse Beijing’s advantage. As is apparent, such risky actions are unlikely. At the most, one may expect the now alerted major powers, to prevent any further gains by China. So this is another important part of the playbook — incremental advances short of the threshold of a likely military response from adversaries, but resulting over time in a more favourable balance of power. We have seen this at the India-China border over the years. There has beenconstant nibbling activity which the Indian side confronts, but it is unable or unwilling to go on a military offensive to reverse Chinese gains. We have to understand these salami-slicing tactics and develop an effective counter-strategy. This may require the ability to use the ambiguity of LAC to make asymmetric gains in zones where we have a tactical advantage. Only then will there be some bargaining chips available with us to restore the status quo.There is a third element in the Chinese playbook that needs attention. China calibrates its posture towards any country based on a careful assessment of the balance of economic and military capabilities. This may sometimes go wrong because Chinese leaders are relatively insular and self-centred in their outlook. There is a cultural predilection towards tactical agility, even deception, in interState relations and little patience with notions of statesmanship. After the 1962 war, China’s default position on the border was the so-called package proposal, essentially formalising the prevailing status quo. In 1985-86, after the Wandung incident in the eastern sector, the package proposal was reinterpreted to mean that a settlement required India to make “meaningful concessions” in the east, the area of largest dispute, for which China would make appropriate-though-undefined-concessions in the western sector. Subsequently, it was conveyed that in any settlement, Tawang would have to be “returned” to China.What we now see is a further moving of the goalposts, with China’s behaviour suggesting that the ambiguity over the precise alignment of LAC gives it the opportunity to trigger incidents at points of choice in order to make both local, tactical gains but to also convey a larger message that it has a stronger hand when dealing with India.Some analysts suggest that India should not provoke China by moving closer to the United States (US), the implication being that distancing from the US and other countries which China regards as adversaries, would somehow lessen the pressure on India. This is strange logic. It suggests that decisions on India’s foreign policy are being made in Washington but should that be replaced by their being made in accordance with Chinese preferences instead? India’s foreign policy should be made in New Delhi in India’s best interests. It has been New Delhi’s experience that strong relations between India and the US, indeed with other major powers, give India greater room for manoeuvre and ability to manage the China challenge. The more isolated India is, the greater its vulnerability to Chinese pressures.At this juncture, no military alliance with the US is on the cards. But building and strengthening a strong and credible countervailing coalition of major powers, which share India’s concerns about the China’s predatory predilections, is prudent policy even as India must marshal its energies to reduce the asymmetry of power with China which is at the heart of our current predicament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/as-the-lac-heats-up-reading-china-s-playbook/story-0b7pzNwsL282ktzMsj5YWK.html
02-06-2020||News||The dismantling of the idea of India||March 24, 2020, was a watershed moment with Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi announcing a national lockdown in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. This black swan event in the first year of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s second term in office has changed our lives. Prior to that date, the government was pushing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s core agenda with characteristic authoritarianism. But the pandemic has humbled all of us, including those with invincible mindsets.Two decisions of Modi-1 cast their shadow on the Modi-2 dispensation. First, the ill-thought-out, knee-jerk decision of the PM on November 8, 2016, to demonetise high-value currency notes. The rich were able to exchange their unaccounted cash but it deprived the poor of their hard-earned money. That was a monetary lockdown that destabilised the economy. The second was the establishment and implementation of a multi-layered Goods and Service Tax (GST) regime, which is mired in confusion even today. Its negative economic fallout impacted the free flow of commercial transactions. The result was that India’s economy grew at 4.2% (2019-20), the lowest in 11 years, as against 6.1% (2018-19). Prior to the pandemic, the unemployment rate touched its highest watermark in 45 years. Industrial growth suffered, as did key sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing, construction, trade, hotels, transportation and communications and financial services. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) warned (in May 2020) about the slackening of private consumption. Economic growth is a continuum subject to occasional hiccups that no one can control. But during Modi-2, these hiccups were man-made. An economy already in decline needed an impetus to revive it. Instead of concentrating on governance issues — including health care, education and the concerns of the poor — Modi-2 tore the nation apart by polarising it with a communal agenda.In August 2019, Article 370 was recast and President’s rule imposed, with the state of Jammu and Kashmir being converted into two Union territories. This paradigm shift was claimed by Modi as a signal achievement. However, the situation on the ground is far from normal. The communication blackout, detention of political leaders and the imposition of curfew resulted in Kashmir witnessing one of its worst economic crises. Despite the government’s iron grip over the Valley, we have been regularly losing members of India’s security forces. The criminalisation of triple talaq on July 30, 2019 had nothing to do with the pain the BJP felt for Muslim women, especially when it did not shed a tear for the two million Hindu women who are abandoned by or separated from their husbands. The passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, under challenge in the Supreme Court, witnessed protests across campuses in the country. In the violence that erupted in Delhi on February 24-25, 53 people lost their lives and hundreds were injured. Instances of police brutality and, on occasion, collaboration with perpetrators of violence, was there for all to see. But the government looked the other way. The possibility of a National Register of Citizens and the announcement of a National Population Register further stoked communal fires. The passing of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 2019, though intended to fight terror, has been used against those who have raised their voice against the government, which includes Right to Information activists, research scholars, thinkers, photojournalists and others. The aim was to silence dissent. Suddenly, on March 24, things changed. But again, Modi made a mistake. He announced a lockdown with just four hours for its implementation. The consequences are there for all to see. An already sliding economy has been hit hard by the lockdown. The fact that all economic activities have been frozen for months will have dire consequences that will push India back for years. The last quarter of 2019-20, with only seven days of the lockdown, brought economic growth down to 3.1%. Economists have predicted that the growth this year will be in negative territory. This has also been endorsed by RBI. That is not all. A 25% reduction in earnings will increase the number of those below the below the poverty line from 21.9% to 46.3%. In the midst of all this, mass migration of hapless victims of the lockdown has resulted in a humanitarian crisis not seen in this country for a long time. Apart from deaths in trains, because of accidents or hunger and thirst, the sheer scale of the misery is captured by the image of a young child lifting his dead mother’s shroud in an effort to wake her up. The government’s initial denial that no migrant was on the road is consistent with its constant denial of the consequences of ill-thought decisions. Modi-1 symbolised muscle power and a determined PM taking knee-jerk decisions. Modi-2 has dismantled an India that was carefully built by successive governments until 2014. It is time the government realises that its divisive agendas will only jeopardise the future of generations to come. This government must abandon its “let the fire burn and the cauldron bubble” policy and shift gears to address the burning issues of poverty and the marginalisation of those at the bottom of the pyramid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-dismantling-of-the-idea-of-india/story-vx8MYF1KJiH52s3V2bb6SK.html
02-06-2020||News||Modi’s plan for economic revival is a game-changer||The first anniversary of the National Democratic Alliance government, popularly referred to as Modi-2, may have been somewhat subdued due to the lockdown as a result of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). But the achievements of the last 12 months were succinctly encapsulated in Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s recent letter to the nation. At the outset, he referred to the Rs 20 lakh crore economic package that he dedicated to the nation on May 12 and stressed his desire to make India self-reliant.There comes a time in a nation’s life when momentous decisions are taken in the interest of not just the current generation, but generations to follow.The year 1991 was a defining moment for independent India, when the then PM, PV Narasimha Rao, opened the country’s zealously-guarded doors to the wider world. It was a decision taken out of compulsion. India was impoverished, out of money and vulnerable. Fear and suspicion were deeply embedded in India’s psyche. We were suspicious of strong foreign forces recolonising us through giant multinational companiesA slew of bold decisions and policy announcements in Modi’s address to the nation on May 12 will go down in the nation’s history as more momentous than those taken in 1991.Modi’s steely political will to make India self-reliant is as courageous as it is visionary. Some of the far-reaching announcements included the push for structural reforms in key areas such as agriculture, defence, coal and public sector enterprises. Linking the benefits to states with their performances was among the highlights of the package. While their positive impact will take time to kick in, there is no doubt that these structural reforms will boost growth. Some in the country expected an instant fiscal stimulus beyond what the country could afford at the moment, or perhaps a reduction in the Goods and Services Tax and income tax rates. They also wanted to see the government’s effort directed exclusively to dealing with the emergency-like situation that we find ourselves in. They gave examples of the United States (US) and United Kingdom’s stimulus packages.Modi’s ideas are all-encompassing. The measures he took ensured that the supply side became robust. Immediately after the lockdown, the government announced a big relief package of Rs 1.7 lakh crore for the bottom 20% of the population. This was followed by a series of measures to provide relief to the poor and farmers. They included cash transfers of over Rs 52,000 crore through Jan Dhan accounts and allocation of an additional Rs 40,000 crore under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme to create jobs for those living on the margins of society. The micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) sector, the backbone of our economy which contributes significantly to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), is the worst hit by the pandemic. The Modi government has taken targeted measures to boost the MSMEs, including with the support of a sovereign guaranteed loan of Rs 3 lakh crore through equity and subordinated loans. The government deserves appreciation for the path-breaking step of changing the definition of MSMEs.What is also commendable is that despite a huge economic package, the government has not tried to punch above its weight. The Reserve Bank of India has also been proactive in supporting the government’s initiatives and has taken many unconventional measures such as the Targeted Long-term Repo Operation to create the right amount of liquidity available in the system for banks, non-banking financial companies and industry. With the economy in motion again, we have the supply side in place. I am certain some more stimulus measures, within the bounds of fiscal prudence, will be taken to boost demand, which will help the economy accelerate. We have to remind ourselves that the pandemic is still wreaking havoc on the world. But a day will surely come when all this is behind us. That, many believe, will signal the beginning of a new world order built on the collapsed edifice of the international order that emerged in the aftermath of World War 2. Where will India be? This is the most important question on the minds of policymakers. Focusing on the pandemic alone would have been a populist but short-sighted move. Modi has wisely recognised the gravity of the current situation and made bold decisions which will help us maintain our position as a leading global playerThe PM’s clarion call for self-reliance is a game changer. Imagine the force, energy, skills and strength a self-reliant nation of 1.3 billion people will bring to bear on the global polity. If the goal of self-reliance is achieved, we will be in a position to perhaps even compete with China in the near future.Modi’s call to self-reliance is in our national interest. In a post-pandemic world, many countries will look to strengthen production and supply chains and promote homegrown products. Self-reliance will come only with a mindset change and some amount of sacrifice and patience. A self-reliant India, he argued, would be in a much better position to contribute to the worldBut self-reliance does not mean an entire reset of the economy or a throwback to the swadeshi model. It is our own “India First” policy. When we become truly self-reliant, we will be one of the world’s leading economic powerhouses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/modi-s-plan-for-economic-revival-is-a-game-changer/story-Dooz84tyn1FJzDXJCpWOOM.html
02-06-2020||Chandigarh||Discrepancies in Covid data leave Haryana health authorities baffled||As many as 2,091 coronavirus cases were recorded in Haryana on May 31, a number that does not go with the data of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Union ministry of health.The ICMR web portal, for the same day, showed two values for the total number of coronavirus cases — 2,875 and 5,529 — while the Union ministry of health showed 2,881 positive cases in the state. The ICMR and health ministry also got the sampling data from 12 government and seven private testing labs in the state. Similarly, the total number of samples tested till June 1 stood at about 1.21 lakh as per the Haryana health department statistics. The ICMR data, however, showed that about 1.33 lakh samples were tested till June 1.In a nutshell, the numbers — sampling as well as positive cases — reflected in the ICMR records are higher than the state data.The glaring discrepancies in the Covid-19 data have serious repercussions in terms of isolating the infected persons, contact tracing, surveillance, infrastructure planning and strategy formulation to tackle the emerging situation. ‘PRIVATE LABS DID NOT SHARE DATA’The data muddle has perplexed the state authorities who suspected private testing labs of suppressing the sampling data.When asked additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora said that a number of private testing labs based in Delhi but having collection centres in Gurgaon and Faridabad did not share the testing data with the state authorities. The private labs though submitted the testing data for the ICMR web portal. “If they do not share the sampling data, how will we do the contact tracing,’’ the ACS said. Officials said that while the labs dispatched the data online to ICMR, they did not share it with Haryana.The health department, subsequently, in a communication to 18 ICMR approved private labs in the national capital asked them to mandatorily inform each Covid-19 positive case from Haryana to the civil surgeons.“It has been brought to the notice of state health authorities that the ICMR approved Covid-19 testing private labs in Delhi were accepting samples of patients and suspects residing in Haryana without the concurrence of Haryana government. Moreover, these labs are not conveying the results to concerned district health authorities even in the case of coronavirus positive results, a serious concern in the control of Covid-19 pandemic. In many cases, incomplete and wrong addresses, incorrect contact details are mentioned which defy surveillance activities,’’ reads the communication sent to private labs.ICMR WEB PORTAL SNAGSEven as the data tangle remained partially sorted, the state government on Tuesday took up the data mess with the ICMR.In a letter to the ICMR director, Haryana’s director-general health services said the state was facing issues regarding the data on the ICMR portal. “There are incomplete entries with no mandatory columns being filled. In many entries, there are wrong, missing or incomplete addresses without contact details. Some cases have a permanent address of a particular district of Haryana, details of which have been taken from Aadhaar card but the patient is not residing at that particular address. There are duplicate data entries. If one person got tested at two labs, the ICMR portal showed two different cases, as there were no unique ID being generated for such patients. There is a mismatch of data between state and ICMR web portal,’’ the letter said.Meanwhile, during an audit of a private lab in Gurgaon, it emerged that while the ICMR data showed a total of 16,889 tests and 825 positive cases of the lab as on June 2, the lab’s own record showed 12916 tests and 635 positive cases.While chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday claimed the government has sorted out the data mismatch and there was nothing to get alarmed, the confusion is far from being over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/discrepancies-in-covid-data-leave-haryana-health-authorities-baffled/story-PExIZnMpk9WtgZioO5EACN.html
02-06-2020||Mumbai||Can’t set up testing labs in all 36 districts: State to HC||The state government said in an affidavit at the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday that it is not possible to set up full-fledged Covid-19 testing labs in all 36 districts.The affidavit filed by director health services, Mumbai, stated that there is a shortage of skilled technicians to operate the labs and facilities in all districts. It added that as more cases were being reported from urban and semi-urban areas, hence most labs were in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Aurangabad. In all, 24 districts have full-fledged testing labs and work on setting up facilities in the remaining districts is being considered.The division bench, headed by chief justice Dipankar Datta, after hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a fisherman from Ratnagiri seeking directions to set up a full-fledged Covid-19 testing lab had asked the state why all districts did not have testing facilities for the novel coronavirus.The PIL filed by a fisherman Khalil Ahmed Hasanmiya Watsa through advocate Rakesh Bhatkar was listed for hearing on Tuesday but it was adjourned to Friday. The state, however, submitted its reply by Dr Sadhana Tayade, director health services, Mumbai stating that before the outbreak there was only one testing lab in Pune but additional labs were made operational at breakneck speed and now there were 79 labs across the state. Of the total labs, 44 were state-run while 25 were private.The affidavit added that though only 24 districts have proper labs, the remaining districts were being serviced by labs in adjoining districts. Tayade also stated that as there is a shortage of skilled manpower and requisite facilities in all districts, thus efforts are being made to upgrade existing labs to be able to handle Covid-19 testing too.The affidavit concludes that the thrust is on having labs in urban and semi-urban areas as most positive cases are being reported from there, however setting up labs in other areas is under consideration and the one at Ratnagiri will become functional in 10 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/can-t-set-up-testing-labs-in-all-36-districts-state-to-hc/story-NtgdtPhaqZ2Gyq0i2atp7L.html
02-06-2020||Mumbai||Shramik train operations to continue; Railways keep eye on waterlogging||The railways will continue operations of special passenger trains and Shramik special trains for migrant workers from the city on Tuesday. With the warning of heavy rainfall due to cyclone Nisarga, the Central, Western and Konkan railway have asked their control room to be on high alert.200 Railway Protection Force (RPF) officials have been deployed on railway stations, foot overbridges (FOB) and on railway platforms to assist passengers. The railways have also formed teams of their disaster management unit that will undertake patrolling of railway tracks to inspect waterlogging.“The control rooms are kept on high alert and constant weather updates will be taken from India Meteorological Department (IMD). Track patrolling will be undertaken and railway engineers will be kept on standby as precautionary measures,” said AK Jain, senior public relation officer, Central Railway.The railways have also formed teams of its railway disaster unit that will be visiting the railway stations and monitoring passenger movement and rainfall.The decision on continuation of trains will be taken after checking on water logging of tracks.“We will decide on the operation of trains to and from the city after inspection and checking of waterlogging and updates from the IMD,” said a senior railway official.Areas like Kurla, Sion, Bandra, Chunabhatti, Masjid Bunder are critical locations for the railways as waterlogging in the areas have disrupted train movements.Earlier, train operations were suspended to Kolkata after cyclone Amphan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shramik-train-operations-to-continue-railways-keep-eye-on-waterlogging/story-D4Ahd14glCJRxCLVnvr2SN.html
02-06-2020||Mumbai||150 Covid patients shifted from BKC||About 150 patients were shifted from the Bandra Kurla Complex’s (BKC) makeshift Covid-19 hospital on Tuesday to the NSCI Exhibition Centre in Worli and Sion Hospital, as a precautionary measure against the arrival of Cyclone Nisarga.BKC is also a low-lying area, however, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), that had built the makeshift hospital, said that although the structure can sustain winds of 80 to 100 km per hour, patients are being shifted as a precautionary measure by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, while addressing citizens on Tuesday evening, said, “Along with heavy rains we are also expecting heavy wind flow due to which, as a precautionary measure, we shifted patients.”MMRDA in a statement said, “The impending threat of Cyclone Nisarga is upon Mumbai. The hospital can sustain strong winds of up to 80 to 100 km per hour, however, with human lives at stake, as a precautionary measure, all the patients (about 150) from the hospital are being shifted by BMC.”The MMRDA had constructed the makeshift hospital in 10 days at the MMRDA grounds in BKC for treating Covid-19 patients and handed over the same to the BMC last month. A BMC official said, “We had to shift patients from BKC as the makeshift structure would be directly impacted by the cyclone as it is on an open ground.”In case of Dharavi that has around 2,000 patients admitted under an isolation and quarantine facility at the slum, BMC officials said they will not require shifting considering they are in a safe place. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, BMC’s G North Ward, under which Dharavi falls, said, “We do not need to shift any patients from Dharavi due to cyclone alert or predictions of rainfall. All patients are in a safe spot.”Meanwhile, in all the remaining Covid-19 care centres the BMC said either the beds are prepared on the pucca structure or are under the structure due to which the patients will not be required to be shifted. A BMC official not wishing to be named said, “There are handful of covid-19 hospitals or health care centres having close proximity to the sea, however, there is no requirement of shifting them considering there is enough buffer space.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/150-covid-patients-shifted-from-bkc/story-LYiBme3SNPsiYFiHMXlUhL.html
02-06-2020||Chandigarh||Delhi govt decision on sealing of borders holds weight:Khattar||The Haryana government which had allowed free movement of people from Delhi after the fourth phase of the coronavirus lockdown appeared on Tuesday to be having second thoughts, after the national capital ordered sealing of its own borders. Responding to mediapersons on the issue, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the decision holds weight as strictness was needed on the Delhi-Haryana border. “The ministry of home affairs has given guidelines that all interstate borders should be opened. We also took a decision to open these. But later, Delhi said the borders should not be opened for now,” Khattar, who was addressing a virtual press conference, said. “Our borders were already closed but when the Delhi government said these should not be opened, we felt what they are saying holds weight. Strictness should be there for now along the Delhi-Haryana border,” he added.The CM said they will talk to the Delhi government as a consensus should be there on interstate issues. On Monday, the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP government ordered the sealing of the Delhi borders for a week in the wake of rising coronavirus cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/delhi-govt-decision-on-sealing-of-borders-holds-weight-khattar/story-bsY90IpCumzMUskby6rFAO.html
02-06-2020||City||Ludhiana MC panel sticks to 2014 CLU, EDC rates, rejects 2017 changes||Ludhiana: A municipal corporation (MC) committee set up to take a decision on change of land use (CLU) and external development charges (EDC) in the city, has decided to continue with rates notified in 2014, rejecting rates issued by the state government in 2017.The decision will benefit people getting building plans approved for residential buildings but will prove to be expensive for those seeking permissions to build commercial propertiesA meeting of the committee was held at Zone D of the municipal corporation (MC) on Tuesday in which the MC commissioner Kanwalpreet Kaur Brar also participated. Earlier the committee accused the building branch of imposing rates from which builders would benefit even when the 2017 rates were rejected by the MC general house in 2017. Members of the committee, councillors Mamta Ashu, Dr Jai Prakash, Gagandeep Singh (Sunny) Bhalla among others said, “As per the rates issued by the state government in 2017, the charges for getting commercial plans approved were reduced while rates of getting residential plans approved were increased. The house had rejected the rates issued by the state government and a committee was formed by mayor Balkar Sandhu to take a final decision on the same. The committee has stood by the decision of house and rates issued in 2014 would be applicable in the entire city.”The proceedings of the committee meeting will now be tabled in the general house meeting and then forwarded to the local bodies department for final approvals. “MC chief Brar has also been asked to take action against the officials who have imposed different rates for approving building plans in the past,” Ashu said. Construction of illegal buildings: Making officials accountableAshu said that the building branch of the MC took action against owners of illegal buildings only when the building violations were brought to the notice of senior officials or councillors. MC chief Brar had been asked to fix the responsibility of officials and action should also be taken against the building inspector or assistant town planner concerned in case of any illegal construction in the area. “Illegal multi-storey buildings have been constructed in Feroze Gandhi Market and near Chand Cinema in the past.Additional commissioner Rishipal Singh has been directed to inquire into the matter and has also been asked to inquire into the role of the municipal town planner (MTP) Monica Anand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-panel-sticks-to-2014-clu-edc-rates-rejects-2017-changes/story-tvht3HMhW5vPBwDxWcWryN.html

02-06-2020||Mumbai||Governor likely to overturn Thackeray’s decision on final year examinations||After objecting to the recommendations made by the state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant for cancellation of final year examinations to the University Grants Commission (UGC), Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari asserted on Tuesday that he has the final authority on the matter as chancellor of all the universities, and the decision for conducting examinations should be taken in consonance with the provisions of the Maharashtra Public Universities Act.The move comes two days after chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray declared that universities will not be holding examinations for final year students and they will be promoted based on their past performance. The announcement was made in a live address made by the CM on Sunday.This may lead to another round of tussle between Koshyrai and the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. The Governor had described the announcement made by Thackeray as “unprecedented’ and made “without any profound thinking on the legal repercussions”. He also said that the decision, if implemented, would jeopardize students’ future.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) have opposed the decision and demanded that exams be conducted.ABVP is the students’ wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).In a letter to the CM written on June 2, the Governor said that he was “surprised” to learn through media reports that the former had declared that “no examinations shall be conducted this year’” while he was still awaiting a response to his letter to the CM.Stating the decision as arbitrary, he said that it has violated the basic principle that to obtain an identical degree, there cannot be two sets of criteria, one who has given examination and for the other who has obtained marks on average. “The examinations cannot be made optional”, the letter states.Koshyari said even though the committee of vice-chancellors constituted by Samant, to analyse the situation and to explore various options available to conduct the examinations, had given its report to the secretary, higher and technical education department on May 6, the same had not been presented to him till date.Samant did not reply to calls and messages.Koshyari stated that he had mentioned that the chancellor’s office shall give further directions after accepting the recommendations of the committee partially or fully once the report was received by him.He added that all vice-chancellors had communicated their preparedness for conducting examinations in a video conference meeting held recently.On May 22, the Governor wrote to the CM to resolve the issue of conducting final year examinations “without any further delay in the larger interest of students.”Previously, Koshyari had not taken any decision on the request made by the state cabinet to appoint Thackeray as MLC from his quota to avoid a constitutional crisis amid the pandemic.Before that, the Governor also did not appoint NCP leaders — Shivajirao Garje and Aditi Nalawade — as members of the state legislative Council, despite being recommended by the CM in December last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/governor-likely-to-overturn-thackeray-s-decision-on-final-year-examinations/story-dX7E2j5u0eitarZwf8BJQO.html
02-06-2020||City||On Day 1 of border sealing, inter-state traffic moves without a hurdle||New Delhi: Traffic moved smoothly at some of the 29 border points in Delhi while intermittent checking was conducted at some others on Tuesday, a day after the Delhi government put stringent curbs on interstate travel for a week to protect the city’s health care resources as coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases crossed 20,000-mark.On Tuesday, Delhi reported 1,298 Covid cases with the total tally reaching 22,132. Eleven more people died over the last 24 hours, taking the toll to 556, according to the Delhi government’s daily bulletin. The average number of daily new cases in the last week has been 1,095 and the Delhi government has been taking several measures to augment bed strength across hospitals and medical institutions. Senior Delhi Police officers said their personnel were briefed not to “unnecessarily harass anyone” and “allow Delhi residents to enter the Capital after seeing their residential proof”. Many regular commuters HT spoke to said that their travel to Delhi from Ghaziabad and Noida was smoother than what they had experienced in the past few weeks despite curbs imposed by the district administrations of the two Uttar Pradesh cities.A Delhi government spokesperson said, “The Delhi government had sent the order to seal all borders to the Delhi police. It is now the job of the police to enforce it. The Delhi police is not under us.” At the Gurugram border, there was no restriction on the Delhi side as commuters, including officer-goers, drove across without any checking by the Delhi Police staff. At the Ghaziabad (UP)-Ghazipur (Delhi) border, the police conducted random checks occasionally during the day time. But in the evening peak hour, no car was being stopped from entering or leaving Delhi. Many commuters said they were confused about whether the restrictions on the border had been relaxed contrary to what the Delhi government had announced a day ago.The Gurugram police, however, closed the barricades to check for movement passes and turned away a few commuters who could not establish a reason to visit the city. The police also asked people to paste the movement pass issued by the district administration on the windscreen of their cars so that their personnel deployed at the border can check it without disrupting the traffic flow.The Haryana government had decided on Sunday evening to ease restrictions on the state’s borders with Delhi in Gurugram that had been in place since May 1. Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday said talks will be held with the Delhi government to build a consensus on the inter-state movement issue. He, however, said some restrictions should stay in place. “Our borders were already closed but when the Delhi government said these should not be opened, we felt what they are saying holds weight. Strictness should be there for now along the Delhi-Haryana border,” Khattar said.Mandeep Singh, a senior executive of a private company in Gurugram, said he had left his home in Hauz Khaz for his office at 7am to avoid any screening from the police at the border. “I left way ahead of my office reporting time because I did not have any pass to show to the police had they stopped me. But, my colleagues who came from Delhi at the usual office time, later told me that there was no checking of any kind. I had a sleepless night for no reason. The government should have made its intention clear,” he said. At the Badarpur border, however, the police checked the identity cards and passes of all commuters entering the national capital by cars or motorcycles, but no questions were asked of those leaving the city.Many motorists had a tough time trying to convince the police that they belonged to Delhi and should be allowed to pass through.“So many people are showing old passes. We don’t know how to deal with them. So, we are going by our judgement in each case,” said an assistant sub-inspector deployed there.“I had gone to perform a puja at my client’s home in Indirapuram in the morning. Nobody stopped me or asked for any pass. Now that I want to return home, the policemen at Delhi border refused to let me in as I do not have a movement pass. I told them Delhi CM has banned other states residents and showed them my Delhi residence proof. But they are not letting me in,” said east Delhi’s Mandawali resident Anil Pandit, after a brief argument with the policemen at the Ghazipur border.When told about such confusion and confrontation, deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said, “The personnel deployed at borders have been briefed to assist people who are facing emergent situations. They have been asked not to harass anyone but guide and educate people properly.”At the Dundahera and Mandi Border-(Chattarpur farms) in south Delhi, commuters were seen crossing the border without any checks, even as police barricades and policemen were present. Similarly, no restrictions were seen at the Maharajpur, Mayur Vihar, and Bhopura borders in east and northeast Delhi, as motorists were crossing the barricades freely.“We are implementing all the provisions mentioned in the new notification. Whatever issues and confusions have come to our notice will soon be resolved. Those who require to visit Delhi should get movement passes to avoid the restrictions,” said Delhi Police spokesperson, Mandeep Singh Randhawa.Movement passes, the real hassleWhile the traffic flow was mostly smooth, the issuance of travel passes by the district magistrates in Delhi appeared to be the real pain for the people. While senior officials in the government said those working in private firms will also be issued passes by the district magistrates (DMs), the district administrations remained divided over whether to give passes only to those engaged in emergency and essential services, or grant permission to others working in non-essential sectors as well. “At a time when all offices and other economic activities have been opened up nationally, it is difficult to restrict the movement of people. Also, there is a waiting of over 4,000 e-pass applications, accumulated over the last two days,” said one DM on condition of anonymity. At least two DMs said e-passes in their district are being issued only to those engaged in essential services. Government employees do not require such passes and persons having a travel pass issued by district in any other states are also allowed to travel. Trucks, cargo and good vehicles are also permitted unrestricted movement, as per the Delhi government’s order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-day-1-of-border-sealing-inter-state-traffic-moves-without-a-hurdle/story-uhTsZOh3pG2n8BAPj9T1nN.html
02-06-2020||Noida||After man tests positive, residents of Ambedkar Basti worry about their livelihoods||After a 21-year old man from an urban slum in Sector-37 tested positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Monday, a number of other residents in the congested locality have been left worrying about their livelihoods apart from being concerned about the spread of the infection in the area.Many residents of Ambedkar Basti who work as domestic workers in the neighbouring sectors said after the Covid-19 case emerged, their employers fear the infection could spread through them prompting many resident groups to bar their entries in housing societies.Gali No 3 of Ambedkar Basti, from where the case was reported, houses hundreds of people who work as domestic helps, gardeners, guards and drivers in the nearby upscale residential area Arun Vihar (spread over sectors 28, 29 and 37). Many of these workers said they were expecting to join work from June 1 following a two-month-long hiatus in the wake of the nationwide lockdown, but now their plans have gone up in the air.Suparna Haldar and Chandana Haldar, who work as domestic helps in Arun Vihar, said even as they were scared of the virus spread, being left two months without wages had rendered them helpless and in desperate need of getting back to their jobs.“ We had received no salaries for April and May, and I was supposed resume work in Sector 27 yesterday. However, our employers asked us to go back home because of this one case,” said Suparna.Sunita Kundru, another resident of Ambedkar Basti was facing similar issues. “I did not earn anything in the last two months and in this period I received no financial support from the families I work for or from the government. We received only 10-kilo wheat and 10-kilo rice from as ration per month,” said Sunita.“Police officers came to the locality and asked the people living in the house where the suspect resides not to step outside, but they would not listen at all. It’s only after the people of the Basti started to object, that they finally went inside their home. Now it’s because of them that we can’t work either,” said Shyam Lal, a resident of Ambedkar Basti, who cleans cars in the neighbouring sectors.Suneeta Devi, another resident of the area, said on Tuesday she was asked to return from the entry gates of the housing society in Sector 27 where she works as a domestic help.Keeping in mind the well being of the residents and fearing a community spread through the residents of Ambedkar Basti, the resident welfare association(RWA) of Arun Vihar has advised its residents to stay cautious.“It’s a difficult situation as most of the helping staff that works here as guards, helps and others live in Ambedkar Basti where a man tested Covid-19 positive on Monday. A few gates were opened and some families are still letting them in and allowing them to resume work. Some families have also called their drivers back on duty. However, we have advised the residents to not let the workers from the basti to join work in a bid to contain the virus from spreading,” said Colonel (Retd.) Shashi Vaidh, chairman, RWA, Arun Vihar.Meanwhile, administration officials said new cases are being tracked closely, and residents in areas from where the cases are reported are being advised against socialising.“All positive patients are being taken to the isolation centres, and their contacts have been asked to remain inside their homes as much as possible,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.Officials said that they are also carrying out sanitisation drives in all the areas.“Our teams are conducting sanitisation drives and spraying disinfectants in all areas where new cases are being reported. Even today, we sanitised over 25 localities and the process will continue,” said Dr Shireesh Jain, assistant chief medical officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/after-man-tests-positive-residents-of-ambedkar-basti-worry-about-their-livelihoods/story-HmwYQEafFUZ7F0XAKySnaL.html

02-06-2020||Delhi||CBSE issues guidelines for students taking board exams from July 1||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Tuesday released the provisions and guidelines for board students slated to appear for their examination between July 1 and 15. The exams had been postponed since March 19 in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the nationwide lockdown that followed.The board has laid down special provisions for students who have returned to their home towns and wish to appear from a different examination centre than their schools. Last week, HT had reported that students in residential or boarding schools were likely to face challenges while returning to their schools to appear for their papers.“The CBSE will allow change of examination centre with respect to candidates who have shifted and are residing in districts other than the place of their school,” the board said on Tuesday. Students who were residing in hostels, or were being sponsored by state governments, or those who have shifted from the district of their school to other districts will be eligible to change their exam centres.Since Delhi will be considered as a single district for this purpose, change of examination centre from one local district to another will not be permitted, the board said. While the exams for 12 subjects of Class 12 will be held across the country, the examinations for six subjects of Class 10 will be held only in north-east Delhi, which was torn by communal riots in February, with the result that children in these parts were unable to take their exams.For students whose schools fall in containment zones, different centres will be allotted outside the containment zone. The board will accept requests of candidates for change of examination centre only through their school. Schools have been asked to contact the students and provide the necessary information to the board through the e-pariksha portal of the CBSE website between June 3 and 11. The board will later provide “Permission Letters” to the schools to forward it to students who will have to take printouts of the letter and carry it to their exam centres.The CBSE has also said the exam results of children with special needs, who need scribes and do not wish to appear for their papers, will be declared as per the assessment scheme that is to be decided by the board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cbse-issues-guidelines-for-students-taking-board-exams-from-july-1/story-Tsk4VRSTiKgu399Kx8G7QO.html
02-06-2020||Delhi||New online property tax format throws up glitches, residents hassled||At a time when the three municipal corporations in the city are facing a financial crunch and are seeking to boost their revenues with property taxes, residents complained that the new version of the online format to fill the tax details is not user-friendly and that there were issues in accessing and submitting forms to pay the tax.Residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) across Delhi have raised the issue with the corporations and urged them to simplify the process and provide assistance to house owners, especially senior citizens, who have been facing the most difficulties. Unlike every year, because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the corporations are unable to set up facilitation camps to help those without internet connectivity or smartphones.According to civic officials, the property tax websites of the corporations -- South, North and East --- have been updated last month and new features were introduced. The sites were under construction until at least May 20. Every year, most house owners deposit the property tax between April 1 and June 30, which is the window when they are entitled to get a 15% rebate on the total amount.From errors in signing up to wiping out previous records of the property, the issues raised by residents are many. Atul Goyal, president, URJA (United Residents Joint Action), an umbrella body of 2,500 RWAs, said the association has written to the corporations to fix the glitches. “There are multiple errors showing up such as not allowing one to register or access the form. Also, the new system does not include all modes of payment,” Goyal said.He added that the site also makes it mandatory to submit banking details for payment. In the previous format, there was an option to generate a receipt with which one could pay the tax by cheque. Also, registering your phone number and email address are now prerequisites to access the form. For many senior citizens, this has become an issue.“Until last year, a civic official would come home to help us with filling up the form. Most of the elderly people do not have email addresses. Many live alone while their children are abroad and nobody is there to help them with online activities. Also, there are network issues and sometimes, the OTP doesn’t get generated,” Ashok Prabhakar (80), president, Malviya Nagar senior citizens forum, said.Rajiv Kakria, member, Greater Kailash-1 RWA, said, “Though I was able to access the website, it was only after four days that I could submit the form. However, one of the major issues is that except for the previous payment details, the rest of the history of my property dating back to the 1960s, the renovations and all other such details till date, have been wiped out.” Radha Krishan, joint assessor and collector, south corporation, said with the help of the central government, a new website has been developed to help taxpayers in the long-run. So far, there was no uniformity in the format and people could access the tax details through multiple ways.“However, because of the newly developed format, users are facing some glitches. We are resolving these and offering help to residents on our zonal helplines on weekends.

They said that the workers, who live hand-to-mouth, have been sleeping outside the shops and sheds where social distancing norms are difficult to follow.The plea also said that several letters were written to the authorities, but so far there has been no response from them.Appearing for the Delhi government, its additional standing counsel Anuj Aggarwal told the court that there are 34 relief centres in the Model Town sub-division, and two hunger relief centres are situated within the Azadpur Mandi.He, however, sought time to file an affidavit furnishing the requisite details detailing how the needs of the labourers stranded at Azadpur Mandi are being met, not only in respect of shelter but also of two square meals a day.Following this, the court said, “An affidavit shall be filed by the Delhi government with all the relevant data on or before June 6… In the meantime, the government shall ensure that the two hunger relief centres set up in Azadpur Mandi are provided with enough cooked food so that the labourers stranded there can be provided packed lunch and dinner daily”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-directs-azadpur-mandi-s-hunger-centres-to-provide-labourers-two-meals-a-day/story-BZ1j7Caqh323r70QN7dgzL.html

02-06-2020||Delhi||As cases rise, parents wary of sending kids to schools even if they reopen a month later||With schools and authorities getting ready with plans to reopen educational institutions sometime in July, parents across the national capital are not in favour of sending children back to schools, even in July, as cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have been rising in the national capital by the day. A cross section of parents HT spoke to on Tuesday said with cases likely to peak in July, going by the present trend, they were wary of sending their wards to school till a vaccination is found for the disease or till the infaction curve flattens in the national capital.Delhi has had over 22,000 cases and 556 deaths till now. Over the last few days, Delhi has seen a record number of cases with the highest ever spike on Tuesday with an increase of 1298 cases in the past 24 hours.An average 968 new cases were reported every day in the last seven days. In the seven days before this, this number was 571, and it was 403 the week before that.As per the ministry of home affairs guidelines released Saturday, schools and educational institutes can reopen in the second phase of the Unlock 1 plan of the Union government to gradually lift the ongoing lockdown. The reopening dates will be announced after consultations with the state governments and all stakeholders, including parents. A decision is this regard is likely in July when the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will also be conducting its remaining board exams.The National Council for Education, Research and Training (NCERT) has already suggested conducting classes in shifts to avoid crowding and curtailing group activities involving the use of common instruments or equipment, among other restrictions. The Delhi government, too, has asked all principals to prepare “micro plans” for opening schools in consultation with teachers, parents, and school management committees.Many parents, however, are wary of sending their children to schools in July – when a peak in cases is expected. Vikas Sharma, whose children study in classes 5 and 1 at DAV Public School, said, “We don’t want schools to reopen till a vaccination is found for Covid-19. A year without education is better than the threat of losing our children.” The Nangloi resident, who has his own business, said, “Most of the parents I have interacted with don’t want this experiment to be done on their children. We won’t send them even if schools decide to reopen.”Rajesh Jha, father of a class 8 student of a government school in Shalimar Bagh, said, “The kind of spike in cases we are seeing now is worrying. Unless there is a drop in cases and the chain is broken, we won’t send our children to school. We are just monitoring the situation and will take a call accordingly.”Aparajita Gautam, president of Delhi Parents Association, said parent WhatsApp groups have been abuzz with discussions on the matter. “When adults are finding it hard to maintain social distancing, how can we expect children to do so? Schools will not take the responsibility of our children falling ill.” The association recommends declaring a “zero year” for all classes, except class 12 students.“There were reported cases of Covid-19 among children once schools reopened in France even after maintaining physical distancing. Even South Korea reported a spike in cases. In view of all this, parents are concerned. There has been no consultations with parents so far in this matter,” she said.A petition on change.org, a popular petition website, started by a group called Parents Association urges the Union minister of human resource development to continue the current academic session in the e-learning mode. The petition has nearly 4,20,000 signatories from all over the country so far.Bharat Arora, general secretary of the action committee of unaided recognized private schools, said, “We would like to assure parents that schools will open only after the government allows us. Once open, the safety of every child will be our priority. In addition to standard operating procedures provided by authorities, we are encouraging schools to have their own SOPs for the safety of children.”Director of education Binay Bhushan said, “The Delhi government hasn’t taken any decision on when schools will reopen. It will depend on the condition prevailing at the time the decision is taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/as-cases-rise-parents-wary-of-sending-kids-to-schools-even-if-they-reopen-a-month-later/story-htBaIe3IQSGrVb0JRatqeI.html
02-06-2020||Noida||Residents approach administration against AOA’s high-handedness||Residents of a high-rise in Sector 78 have approached the office of the district magistrate to highlight violations of the administrative guidelines by the Apartments Owners’ Association (AOA) of the society.Residents of the Hyde Park Society have alleged that the AOA has contravened regulations throughout the lockdown and, despite relaxations in norms, they are not lifting restrictions.“Despite the relaxations in norms, the AOA is making its own rules and going against the directions issued by the administration. There is a restriction on the movement of residents and the entry of domestic help, newspapers, car cleaners, etc.,” a resident of the society said.Residents alleged that since March 17, they have not received newspapers even though they are under the category of essential services.“The latest guidelines only empower the residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) or AOAs to ensure hygiene and measures of social distancing or thermal screening, etc. in the society. However, the AOA is still making decisions that go against the guidelines. We have filed two complaints with the district magistrate’s office against the AOA, which is harassing the residents. They want us to get a medical fitness certificate for the maids, which is not a government regulation,” a complainant said.The AOA has, however, denied these allegations.“We have conducted a survey, for which we shared a Google Form with the residents. All decisions have been taken based on the opinions of the residents themselves,” Ashwini Tripathi, the president of the AOA, said.An official from the district magistrate’s office, requesting anonymity, said, “We’ve received the complaint and officials concerned will look into the matter.”Meanwhile, residents-RWA conflicts have been reported all through the lockdown.Regarding the AOA survey, a resident of a society in Sector 75, who wished to remain anonymous, said, “Very few residents participate in the surveys AOAs circulate. It’s not even a transparent process. And now that there are not a lot of restrictions, surveys are pointless. We should be allowed to bring in domestic help if we need them. I want my cook to start coming but the society is still not allowing them to enter.”The police said that legal action can be taken against residential bodies in case of violations.“Residents can file an FIR and action will be taken in case the RWA or AOA is making its own rules against administrative guidelines,” the additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/residents-approach-administration-against-aoa-s-high-handedness/story-WNdp2j5SbNej3Q2PgfhEiM.html
02-06-2020||Noida||Noida authority employees engaged in essential services demand COVID-19 tests||Employees of Noida authority engaged in providing essential services have asked the administration to test them for coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Noida employees association (NEA), a group of all staff members of the authority, had met the senior officials of the authority over the issue and had submitted a letter last week demanding camps to conduct random Covid-19 tests for the employees.The Noida authority staff is engaged in the distribution of food to migrant workers and others who were rendered jobless after the imposition of the nationwide lockdown apart from delivering vegetables, groceries in containment zones, and carrying out sanitisation drives across the city.NEA said many employees are worried about their safety after at least six employees, including three accountants, one senior official, and two assistant accounts, showed symptoms of fever and cough (both indicators of possible Covid-19 infection).“We have demanded the administration to conduct random tests of our employees who are possibly exposed to the infection. Many staff members are going daily into hot spots to carry out their duties and they can get infected easily because they are also engaged in disinfecting houses, public spaces, and common areas there. We hope the district health department will start random testing of the employees,” said Dharmendra Sharma, vice-president, Noida Employees association.There are at least 5,000 Noida authority employees who work with multiple departments including horticulture, water, sewer and health department.NEA president Rajkumar Singh said he hopes that the district administration will soon start testing all the employees.“Senior officials have communicated our demands to the district magistrate and other officials in the district health department. We hope that random Covid-19 for our employees will start form Wednesday,” said Singh.Senior district admin officials said the health department cannot conduct Covid-19 tests for all employees because of limited testing capacity. As per protocol, they will first examine people for Covid-19 symptoms and if they feel that someone needs to be tested, they will collect the samples of the suspected patients.“The employees should surely be tested. We will raise the request with the chief medical officer,” said Suhas LY district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-employees-engaged-in-essential-services-demand-covid-19-tests/story-ezeRIk1Ku9At9fWZf6gkNP.html
02-06-2020||City||Delhi government launches mobile app to track corona beds||New Delhi: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday launched a mobile app, called “Delhi Corona”, using which residents can track the number of available hospital beds and ventilators in Covid-dedicated hospitals across in the national capital. The service can also be accessed using a web browser.While launching the app at a video press briefing, Kejriwal said, “There are 6,731 beds in the city’s hospitals, of which 2,819 beds are occupied, while 3,912 are vacant. Of 302 ventilators in the hospitals, 92 are occupied and 210 vacant. But people are often unable to gather information on hospitals and availability of beds... To bridge that information gap, we have launched an app. You can download this app to avail information on bed availability in various government and private hospitals in Delhi.”The app does not require a user to register or provide any details before using it.He, however, stressed on the importance of home isolation, and asked people to follow doctors’ advice in this regard. As per guidelines issued by the Union health ministry, Covid-19 patients who are asymptomatic, or display mild symptoms can isolate at their homes, instead of being admitted to hospitals, subject to them meeting certain criterion.As per the Delhi government’s daily health bulletin, the national capital currently has 12,573 active Covid-19 patients, of whom more than 7,461 are in home isolation. “Delhi is four steps ahead of coronavirus in the race, and even if the number of cases is rising, we have made all arrangements if somebody from your family gets infected with the virus. While we say that there is adequate health infrastructure such as beds, ventilators, and ICUs, we receive distress calls and messages from people not getting beds for treatment in hospitals. There is a gap in information,” the chief minister said on Tuesday. Kejriwal had last week announced that such an app would be launched, to quell this “confusion”.The application will be updated twice a day, Kejriwal said, adding: “It is very important to ensure proper management of the health care system to avoid overcrowding hospitals. If a doctor says there is no need to be admitted in the hospital and advises you to self-isolate at home because you are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms, please do it… Please do not panic. We have appointed a team which will be in regular touch with you and your family. If your condition worsens, you will be immediately transferred to a hospital and bed will be arranged for you.” Kejriwal said that if the app tells a patient that beds are empty in a hospital, but the staff refuses to admit them, they can call on the helpline number 1031 and the special secretary will immediately speak to hospital authorities and ensure that patients get help. The application can be downloaded through the Google Play Store or through a link availed by sending a message on a WhatsApp number. The application can also be accessed on its web portal.Later in the day, Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal met Kejriwal, health minister Satyendar Jain, members of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) and other top officers in the city for a review meeting on Covid preparedness and resource augmentation, said a press statement issued by the LG’s office.In the meeting, the government was directed to scale up the number of beds with oxygen facilities, ICU beds and ventilators in the dedicated Covid hospitals. The L-G also reviewed the mobile application launched earlier in the day.Baijal also appoined two IAS officials as nodal officers for “proper communication of data” related to Covid-19 from private and government hospitals in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-government-launches-mobile-app-to-track-corona-beds/story-hpdVWWNY4m3yV9uzs9YoRO.html

The state government is taking up all effort to tackle spread of the coronavirus. I spoke to seven corona patients at the hospital. It also included a doctor at the airport and he told that he probably contracted infection at airport and could not maintain social distancing.”The move to start emergency services had several health department officials in the district in a fix. “The hospital is meant exclusively for critical Covid-19 patients and any opening of emergency services for non-Covid patients may pose potential risk,” said one official.CMO Gupta and distric magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey offered no any comment over the issue.“We have non-Covid emergency services at MMG Hospital and Women Hospital while the L-2 (secondary care where moderate cases are treated)category Covid hospital is kept separate and not allowed to operated emergency services due to risk of spread of infection,” CMO said.The tally of Covid-19 cases on Tuesday in Ghaziabad stood at 344 as 13 more cases were added to Monday’s tally of 331.

This will help is strengthen containment activities,” Prasad said. “We have already procured 41 tru-net machines which were brought in by state plane and 34 more will arrive in next 2-3 days. We already have 20 of these. These machines will be given to each of the 75 districts and will considerably boost testing of Covid-19 samples and ensure faster results.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/50-year-old-woman-dies-as-minister-inspects-l3-covid-hospital-in-ghaziabad/story-nELlSMthmuYCOyrcKZOjwM.html

02-06-2020||City||Chaos, confusion prevails after Vaishali locality sealed||The Ghaziabad administration on Monday night sealed Vaishali as the number of Covid-19 cases from the area reached 34, evoking sharp reactions from the residents who alleged that there was no clarity on provisions for door-step delivery of essential services, whether domestic helps would be allowed and the closure of markets in the neighbourhoods. The administration has not specified for how long the measures will be in place. The total number of Covid cases in Ghaziabad district on Tuesday was 331.The main roads leading to Vaishali remained choked since Tuesday morning as residents wanting to move out and those attempting to enter the area were stopped by police at all entry and exit points. Under the sealing drive, Vaishali was divided into two zones comprising four sectors, officiated by administrative, police and health department officers who would be responsible for sampling, tracing and surveillance for the coronavirus.“The restrictions on entry and exit are for all, except essential services, and we have covered all sectors from 1 to 9. Residential colonies have not been sealed but the access controlled roads have been sealed. Those providing essential services can access the areas through two points, one near Max Hospital and the other at sector-4,” said Anshu Jain, circle officer (Indirapuram).But without clear directions, particularly after the central government had relaxed lockdown norms, the residents were caught unaware. The central government’s order had allowed state governments to decide on how relaxations ought to be implemented within their jurisdiction.“We also sealed our society gates too. Our residents had issues when their online grocery orders were not delivered. Since the lockdown the delivery boys were allowed to come to the main gate. Other residents complained that their domestic helps, plumbers, technicians, etc .,were not allowed to enter. The domestic helps started their work last week but now they were again denied entry,” said Mohit Sharma, joint secretary of Express Green high-rise in sector-1. “The local markets which opened last week were again shut down and only some shops dealing in groceries, fruits, vegetables and milk were allowed to open only from 8am to noon. Since we are also clueless about state of affairs and clear directions, we circulated the number of our sector magistrate to residents to directly reach him for complaints.”Thirty-four markets in the city were allowed to open on alternated days with two days for sanitisation from May 22. But with the sealing on Tuesday, they too have been temporarily put out of business.“We tried our best to clean, sanitise and even stock up. But now it is back to what it was during the lockdown. Our employees who had started report for work were not allowed and sent back. Even we cannot deliver items to our customers,” said Sanjay Rastogi, president of Vaishali Udyog Vyapar Mandal. “Delivery agents were not allowed to come in. The sub divisional magistrate did not specify till when the sealing will be in place.”Aditya Prajapati, the sub divisional magistrate, did not respond to calls or messages about the issues raised by residents.Vaishali is comprised of nine residential sectors and an estimated population of about 150,000 people. It comprise of malls, markets, residential and commercial areas.“When I arrived on Tuesday morning the cops did not allow me to move in to Vaishali. We have our office in sector 3. The entry points are blocked with barricades and buses. The putting up of blockades was initited on Monday evening and even on Tuesday morning. I informed my office that I will not be able to come and went back home.even people who came afoot were not allowed in or out,” said Naveen Rastogi, a sales executive who lives in Dilshad Garden in Delhi.Like Vaishali, the other localities neighbouring Delhi like Khoda (41 cases till June 1) and Loni (29 cases till June 1) were sealed since May 10 and May 27, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chaos-confusion-prevails-after-vaishali-locality-sealed/story-2XOT27bjeNuxMP11VZjJuO.html
02-06-2020||City||Despite Delhi seals its border, Ghaziabad and Noida commuters have free run||Ghaziabad/Noida: Even as the Delhi chief minister on Monday announced to seal the borders for a week, the movement of vehicles on Tuesday was smooth and there was no strict checking at the national capital’s borders with Ghaziabad and Noida.Several commuters from Ghaizabad and Noida had a free run in the morning and also returned home without hindrance in the evening. Commuters said that there were hardly checks put in place by the UP Police or the Delhi Police at the borders.To contain the rising Covid-19 cases, both Ghaziabad and Noida have announced restrictions on border movement, and only those involved in essential services or people with valid passes are allowed to entre the two cities.“There was no stoppage of traffic either by the Ghaziabad police or the Delhi Police, and the commuters went smoothly to Delhi. There were barricades at the border, but no checks were in place in morning hours. I came back home around 5.30pm and still there were no checks by the police on either side,” said Kuldeep Saxena, a commuter from Indirapuram who works at Qutub Institutional Area in South Delhi.“Only the internal expressway lanes of NH-9 near Ghazipur were blocked due to construction works. Although the authorities in both cities have announced sealing of borders, there is hardly any restriction at ground level,” Saxena added.For commuters going to Delhi from Noida, the situation was similar in the morning hours. People coming to Noida faced traffic congestion, while those going to Delhi had a smooth sail on Tuesday.“Though the traffic movement was better than Monday, there was thorough checking at the Noida border. But the other side seemed clear as always,” said Rishi Oswal, a commuter from Delhi travelling via DND Flyway.The barricading at Delhi side was done after 10am, said officials of the Gautam Budh Nagar police.“The traffic was considerably less compared to yesterday’s. But people without requisite documents were being turned away from both sides,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Zone 1.The officials said that old passes will work for entry in both Delhi and Noida.Anita Singh, a resident of Greater Noida West, said, “We have a medical pass to visit a relative in Delhi and we have been travelling for the past one week. In the evening when we went through the Kalindi Kunj area, we found the police presence and even barricading on the Delhi side. However, the traffic was smooth and we were able to go comfortably.” At the Ghaziabad’s UP Gate border, the checks, however, were put up around 12.30pm on Tuesday, the district police said.“I was going to Delhi without a pass, and the cops turned me back at UP Gate around 12.30pm. Then I took the UP Gate flyover and went towards East Delhi. There were no checks by the Delhi Police,” said Prateek Kumar, a resident of Patel Nagar III in Ghaziabad, who works with a company in Noida’s Sector 65.The Ghaziabad authorities had issued directions for strict sealing of borders with Delhi in the wake of rising number of cases related to cross-border travel. “We have already placed checks and sealing at the borders. However, the traffic was smooth at UP Gate on Tuesday. To avoid any jams, we usually resort to random checks during peak hours. But we keep a tab on vehicles moving across the border. Only those having valid passes or engaged in essential services are allowed to move through,” said Anshu Jain, circle officer (Indirapuram).Thousands of commuters from Ghaziabad and Noida go to Delhi daily to attend their offices which have now opened in the national capital following relaxations in lockdown.The Ghaziabad officials have advised commuters to return from Delhi after 6pm. In his directions on May 25, the district magistrate had issued a list of commuters who are exempted and can move to Delhi on the basis of their identity cards or through special authroisation issued by their offices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/despite-delhi-seals-its-border-ghaziabad-and-noida-commuters-have-free-run/story-gmnlWgI9MWEK445v57NzYN.html

02-06-2020||City||Interstate movement between Delhi and Gurugram will continue to be regulated, says district administration||Gurugram: The district administration stated in its latest order on Tuesday that interstate movement will continue to be regulated for now, making it clear that the curbs at the Gurugram-Delhi border are likely to remain in place till further orders.Gurugram Police has closed the borders on May 1 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease(Covid-19) as many cases were traced back to the Capital. The checking was relaxed in the following days due to the resulting traffic congestion on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway though the police continued to randomly screen commuters.On Tuesday, district administration released a fresh order regarding Unlock 1.0, stating that there shall be no restrictions on the intrastate movement of persons and goods. However, e-permits will be required for movement outside the state.Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said that the borders will be regulated by previous orders and mechanism in this regard. “Until further orders, movement passes from district administration are needed for the movement between the two cities. Those who already had passes until May 31, do not need to apply for fresh as they have automatically extended the dates until June 30,” he said. The Haryana government on Monday issued orders stating that the passes already generated and issued from the SARAL portal shall automatically stand extended till June 30, under Unlock 1.0.Khatri said that for passes, people can apply on the SARAL Portal to travel to the national Capital and the process of passes is ongoing. “The passes will be issued only in case of a medical emergency, personal emergency and for employees of the company who already have permissions for running their operations. Passes will also be given for the movement of vehicles engaged in essential services and people exempted from the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions or if the company has already taken permission for operations,” he said.Meanwhile, responding to mediapersons on the issue, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the decision of Delhi government to shut borders holds weight as strictness was needed on the Delhi-Haryana border. “The ministry of home affairs has given guidelines that all interstate borders should be opened. We also took a decision to open these. But later Delhi said the borders should not be opened for now,” said Khattar, who was addressing a virtual press conference. “Our borders were already closed but when the Delhi government said these should not be opened, we felt what they are saying holds weight. Strictness should be there for now along the Delhi-Haryana border,” he added.The CM said they will talk to the Delhi government as a consensus should be there on inter-state issues.The Gurugram police continued to carry out random checks at their side of the border leading to minor congestion near the barricades during peak hours as the traffic slowed down.Many commuters said that they were confused about whether the restrictions on the border had been relaxed or made severe.The daily commuters said after the news circulated on social media that the borders were sealed in Delhi, they started early and crossed the border before the sunrise to escape police screening. “I am very confused and had a sleepless night as I had to cross the border early morning before the police start checking. The police get active after 8 am, until then I have crossed many times and its free flow,” said Mandeep Singh, senior executive of a private company.Around 25 police personnel were deployed at Sirhaul border, out of which nine were randomly checking the vehicles and had turned away several commuters who were not carrying valid permissions for work.The police said the volume of traffic was high during Tuesday evening which resulted in long queues at Sirhaul, Dundahera and DLF Phase-3 connecting to Aya Nagar in Delhi following which they had removed barricades for half an hour.Gurugram police commissioner Muhammad Akil said they will continue to follow the existing directions till the state government issues new guidelines. “We have not received any new guidelines for the borders but we are randomly checking the vehicles. The residents travelling to Delhi are allowed to cross the border if they have valid movement passes or identity cards to establish valid reasons to visit the city for work,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/interstate-movement-between-delhi-and-gurugram-will-continue-to-be-regulated-says-district-administration/story-vGYfRnOa3ZgszncSi7hkiP.html
02-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram admin divides district into seven zones to handle surge in Covid-19 cases; tally crosses 1,000-mark||The administration on Tuesday divided the district into seven zones in a bid to tackle the rising cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). With Covid-19 cases crossing 1,000 on Tuesday, senior officials said that dividing the district into separate zones would streamline the process of handling new coronavirus cases being reported from different containment areas. The officials said the division will also help in increasing surveillance and contain the spread of the disease.“We are following a multi-pronged approach. The district has been divided into seven zones, including five zones in Gurugram city and two in Sohna and Pataudi blocks. Each zone will have several containment areas where Covid-19 cases have been detected. District administration and health department officials have been designated as nodal officers to look after the management of each of these seven zones,” said Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner. Currently, there are 63 containment zones in the district. With 160 new Covid-19 cases reported on Tuesday, the total count of persons infected with Sars-CoV-2 virus has reached 1,063. Since May 26, cases in Gurugram have increased by more than 200%. The city saw a huge spike on May 28 when 68 cases were reported, followed by 115 cases on May 29, 157 on May 30, 97 cases on May 31, and 129 on June 1. Under the administration’s new plan, a separate control room would be set up at the civil surgeon’s office from where data on Covid-19 positive cases will be shared with the nodal officer each new zones.Dr Asruddin, director, health services (training), who has been deputed to monitor the situation in Gurugram and neighbouring Faridabad for a week, said, “At the control room level, the positive cases will be segregated based on the new zones and the containment areas in these zones. The nodal officer will coordinate with the health team of the Urban Primary Health Centre (PHC) or Community Health Centre (CHC) of the respective area to reach to the affected patient at the earliest.” He added that the health team will suggest home isolation or hospitalisation based on the health condition of the patient.According to state health officials, earlier the number of cases reported in the city were fewer, and hence only the district health department was engaged in dealing with them. “It is now important to streamline the internal process to avoid any delay in reaching out to the positive patients and prevent the infection from spreading,” said Dr Asruddin. The administration is also concerned about the alleged delay in sharing of Covid-19 test reports by private labs in the city which, officials said, hampers the surveillance of the positive patients. To address the issue, Dr Asruddin said, the state government is planning to start a Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test facility in Gurugram soon. “We are in the process of establishing the lab so that two to three days are not wasted in waiting for the report. With the new lab, the results can be delivered within 10-12 hours,” he said.Acknowledging that the cases will continue to surge in the city, Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, said, “After the relaxations under phase 4 of the nationwide lockdown, the public movement has led to the intermingling of infected and non-infected persons. After May 26, there has been a spurt in cases as many people have started developing Covid-19 symptoms.” Arora, however, said that majority of the cases are asymptomatic and do not require immediate critical care. “We have already started self-paid and government-paid isolation facilities in different hotels in the city and many asymptomatic patients are getting admitted there. Asymptomatic cases are also being discharged after 10 days to accommodate new patients.”DC Khatri said residents should not panic as the administration is strengthening government health facilities to provide treatment to critical patients. According to him, an epidemiological plan is being prepared to project future cases so that suitable action can be taken accordingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-admin-divides-district-into-seven-zones-to-handle-surge-in-covid-19-cases-tally-crosses-1-000-mark/story-fgVF5bmYAvVLzDfIpVDL9H.html
02-06-2020||City||Delhi HC seeks data on migrant workers||New Delhi The Delhi High Court on Tuesday directed the central and the Delhi governments to give data on migrant workers available with them as of June 1 and detail the procedures being followed for contractors or employers to register such workers. The court said the first significant measure would be collection of the actual data and its integration between the Centre and the state governments.Justice Pratibha M Singh directed the Ministry of Labour, Union of India and the Delhi government to file affidavits detailing the number of establishments currently registered under the Inter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979. The court was hearing a plea that had sought implementation of this Act.The petitioner, Shashank S Mangal, had sought framing of rules for migrant workers under the Act for its operation in the national capital.In its interim order, the court sought the number of licences issued to contractors, number of inter-state migrant workers who registered under the Act, action taken against ‘contractors’ and ‘employers’ for contravention of provisions of the Act since 2010. The court asked for the total number of “officers” appointed under provisions of the Act.The court said, “The recent crisis which the country has witnessed with respect to migrant workmen shows that for the effective enforcement and implementation of the Act, there is an immediate need for proper data to be always available so as to ensure that steps can be taken in a timely and adequate manner, especially in times of a pandemic such as Covid-19 or in any other form of emergent situation”.It said the collection of data should be vertically integrated so that data relating to migrant workmen, from the Centre and the states is collected, cross-checked, maintained and is readily available, without any time lag. In order for any measures to be taken for migrant workmen, such data is of prime importance,” it added.Appearing for the Delhi government, its standing counsel Ramesh Singh, told the court that the registering officers, licensing officers,appellate officers and inspectors had been appointed by the Delhi government. He said the Rules under this Act had been notified.The Central government standing counsel, Kirtiman Singh, sought time from the court to produce information on the appointment of these officials.The court, while passing the order, said “prima facie”, in order to have a proper, streamlined regulation of migrant workmen and their conditions of service, the first and the foremost significant measure would be the collection of actual data and its integration between the central and the state governments.The matter would be now heard on June 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-hc-seeks-data-on-migrant-workers/story-lndauHuCf4UmrB0pG5wzFN.html

02-06-2020||Gurugram||Residents arrange transport for nearly 800 migrants stranded at Tau Devi Lal Stadium||Ibrahim, an ageing contract labourer, said he came to find work in Gurugram from Bihar’s Araria district not too long before the lockdown. While heating tar for construction and road work, he began to lose his eyesight. “Now I am blind. One of the contractors who employed me took me to a doctor, but I have no money for the treatment. I have been out of work because I can’t see. I came here because I had no other option of going home,” Ibrahim said. Ibrahim is one of nearly 800 migrant workers from Bihar who began their journey back home on Tuesday, after being stranded at Tau Devi Lal Stadium in Sector 38 for over 36 hours since Monday morning. Ibrahim added that, out of hesitation of having to ask for a stranger’s help to find a bathroom, he has been avoiding eating and drinking. “All day yesterday I just sat here waiting to board a train. I am scared,” he said, crying.As news of the stranded migrants’ plight began circulating on social media, civil society groups and citizens came together to arrange at least 20 private buses which left for Bihar on Tuesday.According to official rolls, at least 774 migrants spent the night at Tau Devi Lal Stadium under two large, makeshift tents after they were denied seats on a Shramik Special train bound for the east Indian states of Jharkhand, Bihar, West Bengal and Odisha, which left at around 6pm on Monday. “There were several migrants outside the gate who had to be brought in as we were trying to prevent a law and order situation,” Hitender Singh, sub-divisional magistrate, Badshahpur, and nodal officer for train movement within the district, said. From late Monday until Tuesday afternoon, the stadium was in chaos with several volunteers from the Civil Defence, and civil society groups such as the Gurugram Nagrik Ekta Manch, assisting stranded migrants with food and water and scrambling to answer their questions about their return home. Social distancing was scarcely followed, with many migrants clamouring around volunteers, who were creating an inventory of those left behind (for use during medical screenings later). The migrant workers could finally leave for their homes when seven buses, organised by a private citizen, arrived at Tau Devi Lal Stadium on Tuesday morning. By afternoon, 10 more buses had arrived and the medical screening of the passengers had begun. A Hindustan Times team saw at least three buses leaving the stadium bound for Bihar. Manas Fuloria, CEO, Nagarro, said, “We have contributed a small amount for hiring private buses to ferry back the migrants, as have other residents and corporates in Gurugram. Majority of the effort has been put in by Puneeta, though.” Puneeta Chadha Khanna, a city resident who was instrumental in organising relief efforts, was unable to take calls on Tuesday and did not respond to messages. Singh said, “The Shramik Special train which left on Monday was intended only for those travelling to West Bengal and Odisha. However, as the train would be passing through Bihar and Jharkhand, several migrants from these states came to Gurugram in hopes of catching the train. We did not publish any communication saying that Bihar residents should come to Tau Devi Lal Stadium.”However, migrants received an SMS about the travel arrangement around 10.30pm on Sunday. “This message is from the Gurugram district administration. Based on your registration on the E-Disha website, arrangements have been made for your travel from GURUGRAM to BIHAR via train. Kindly take efforts to reach Tau Devi Lal Stadium, Rajeev Chowk, Gurugram, at the 10am on 1.6.20,” read the SMS, which multiple migrants and NGO workers showed HT on Tuesday. “We packed up our belongings, settled accounts with our landlords, and came to the stadium. After coming here, we were told that there is no place on the train for us,” Chandresh, a migrant from Bihar’s Kishanganj district who was travelling with his wife and infant daughter, said. Ram Kumar Tiwari, from Bihar’s Gopalganj district, who spent the night at Tau Devi Lal Stadium, said, “We found out late on Monday that there is no arrangement for us. I called up my landlord to ask if he could let me stay one more night, as we were promised buses the next day, but he refused. So we had no choice but to sleep over here.” While Chandresh and Kumar, who were residing in Gurugram, were able to make their way back home on Tuesday, several other migrants from other districts were not so lucky. A senior official in Haryana Roadways’ Gurugram division, seeking anonymity, also confirmed that at least 10 state buses were sent to at least four districts—Rewari, Sirsa, Karnal and Narnaul—to ferry migrants from Bihar to Gurugram on Monday. “Close to 500 migrants were brought to Tau Devi Lal Stadium, but the buses were sent back as there was some confusion at the site,” said the Roadways official. Yet another five buses, organised by the NGO Safe in India to bring 150 Bihar migrants from Manesar to Gurugram, were also turned back from the stadium.The migrants who were sent to their original destinations are currently being put up in government shelters. “In Rewari, about 400 migrants from Bihar have been kept in a school which is being used as a makeshift shelter. There are close to 30 people in a room,” an NGO worker who has been on-site at Tau Devi Lal Stadium since Monday evening said. “When we realised that migrants have collected in large numbers, we requested the railways to increase the capacity of the train to accommodate more passengers, but coaches were not available. Finally, we could repatriate about 1,600 migrants from West Bengal, Orissa and Jharkhand,” Singh said. “For Bihar migrants who have been sent back to Rewari and other districts, we will be making arrangements either by train or bus by the end of the week,” he added. Chinar Chahal, SDM, Sohna, and nodal officer for bus movement in the district, said, “We took all care to keep the migrants fed. We distributed hand sanitiser, food, water and ORS packets and even slippers for those who were barefoot. I am not the right person to comment on why the situation arose, but buses were arranged the next day for Bihar migrants.” Gurugram deputy commissioner could not be contacted for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/residents-arrange-transport-for-nearly-800-migrants-stranded-at-tau-devi-lal-stadium/story-nqcrThzdiNRqzSzy3xHxMO.html

02-06-2020||Gurugram||Lockdown delays heritage conservation projects in Haryana||Two and a half months of lockdown have further slowed heritage conservation projects in Haryana. Officials from the state’s department of museum and archaeology said that they were planning to initiate site visits and prepare a report on the status of projects with the easing of restrictions.Banani Bhattacharyya, deputy director, directorate of archaeology and museums, said that the lockdown had affected the timelines of various projects.“Many projects are now pending because routine work could not be carried out. Site visits required people to travel from Chandigarh to different locations and stay over. That was not happening,” said Bhattacharyya.Due to various factors such as shortage of staff and budget, the process of taking up heritage sites for conservation is slow and tedious in the state. The lockdown has further pushed back this process. In Nuh district, the department had initiated the process of taking Chuhimal’s complex under its protection last year. Tauru tomb complex is also on the table for conservation. Other monuments such as the Qutab Khan ki Masjid in Bhondsi and Lal Gumbad tomb have been taken under protection on paper, while groundwork is yet to resume.While the department is unsure by when it will be able to resume site inspections, administrative and paperwork involving different administrations were being carried out. Bhattacharyya also said that the department was working towards putting in place a plan of action for heritage conservation that could be implemented as the situation improves. “As the lockdown restrictions lift, we aim to go on a tour of various sites and create an assessment report. Our technical team can at least start preparing a report on the basis of which we could plan ahead. The pandemic has impacted both tourism and conservation but we will have to carry on with efforts,” said Bhattacharyya, adding that new measures would need to be adopted for future conservation activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/lockdown-delays-heritage-conservation-projects-in-haryana/story-D4yO3r30e2ZMP6t2OqGbXI.html

02-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram MLA announces ₹25 lakh reward for best- performing govt employee||To motivate government employees and encourage them to perform better while serving the city, Badshapur MLA Rakesh Daultabad, on Monday, announced a ₹25 lakh reward for the best public servant in the district. The MLA, however, said that he is also compiling a list of non-performing government employees based on the feedback from city residents. “We have received a lot of response regarding non-performance of employees. We are compiling the data and preparing the list. This would be shared with the chief minister within a month,” he said. Referring to the reward, Daultabad said that his team has created a system through which the public will give rating based on the service provided by the government employees. The rating system, he said, is similar to how customers of food delivery companies or cab aggregators rate their services while utilising their apps.The rating would done by city residents both on the phone and also through a WhatsApp questionnaire that would be sent to them, he said. Daultabad, who won the assembly election as an independent candidate, said that the reward would given in June 2021 and that he will be spending money from his own pocket.“Right now, employees of departments related to electricity, road and water will be assessed for the reward. A separate reward will be announced for other departments,” he said, adding that the idea behind the move is to motivate employees so that they offer their best services to the public.When asked about non-performers, the MLA said that there is a long list submitted by the public but his team is scrutinising the data to ensure that there is no innocent person included in the list. “There is a lot of corruption and lack of delivery at the lower level in government departments. It is my firm belief that Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar will initiate action against those who are not delivering the goods,” he said. Daultabad said that his objective was to ensure that services affecting common citizens are given due importance. The local BJP leaders, however, criticised the move and described it as a populist announcement. “This money should have been used for poor workers who have been trying to reach their homes during the lockdown. This is a move to hide non-performance,” said Kamal Yadav, a leader of Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-mla-announces-25-lakh-reward-for-best-performing-govt-employee/story-hVvBTdPZD0r8aj1M6KmJeK.html

02-06-2020||Gurugram||Two local residents beat up MCG officials during stray cattle drive||Two officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) were allegedly beaten up by two local residents in Sector 52 during a stray animal capturing drive on Monday.MCG’s assistant sanitary office Baljeet Singh, who was leading the drive, in his complaint to the police, said the two officials were part of a team that was capturing stray animals in Sectors 52 and 53. The alleged incident took place around 10.45 am near an empty plot in Sector 52. The two MCG workers were at a small distance from the rest of the team and were allegedly approached by the two locals who started thrashing them.Singh said in his complaint that by the time the team reached the spot to rescue their colleagues, the suspects had fled from the spot. He further said as they were fleeing the two suspects threatened to kill MCG workers if they tried to capture their animals in the future again. As per MCG, the two workers sustained some bruises, but their injuries were not serious. Following the alleged incident, the MCG approached the Sector 53 police station and a case under sections 186, 332, 353, and 506 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions, voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant, assaulting public servant, and punishment for criminal intimidation was registered against the suspects.“Any kind of physical violence against MCG officials is regarded as a serious offence. There is no leniency shown for such acts. We have initiated all proceedings against the suspects as per the law and an FIR has been registered with the Gurugram police in the matter,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG. Gurugram police are yet to make any arrests in the matter. “We have received inputs from the MCG in the matter and our investigation is ongoing. We expect to make the arrests soon,” said inspector Deepak Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Sector 53 police station.MCG has been capturing stray animals ever since the national lockdown was enforced to combat the spread of coronavirus. In the last two months, MCG has captured over 366 stray animals.According to the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994, animal owners cannot leave their pets in the open or let them roam around in public places, roads, or vacant areas. Owners are only allowed to keep pets within their own boundary walls, and the failure to the norm can result in MCG transporting animals to their shelters and also initiating action against the animal owners. It is not the first time that MCG officials have suffered injuries during a stray animal capturing drive. In July 2017, four MCG sanitation workers were thrashed allegedly by villagers with batons, and sticks during a similar drive in Nathupur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-local-residents-beat-up-mcg-officials-during-stray-cattle-drive/story-jKbGJTJ94bcc6Vlwtdxj8M.html

02-06-2020||Chandigarh||Gang of fuel thieves busted in Haryana, 7 arrested||With the arrest of seven people from Rohtak district, Haryana Police on Tuesday claimed to have busted a gang involved in fuel theft from Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) pipeline. Those arrested are Sachin (kingpin of the gang), Joginder, Aarti, Satbir, Prashant, Anil and Karambir alias Kala, a police spokesperson said. Prashant and Anil run petrol pumps in Rohtak and Jhajjar where they used to sell the stolen oil. The police said that Sachin and one of his accomplices Ashok, who is at large, had suffered losses in a business. Later, the duo hatched a plan to steal oil from Rewari-Panipat pipeline that passes through Sampla area. In November 2019, Sachin and Ashok, along with other accused, started stealing oil from another pipeline passing through Pakasma fields. When the oil company detected the theft in December 2019, the accused absconded. In January- February this year, they again surfaced and this time targeted the pipeline passing through Naunand village. After noticing a fall in pressure, the oil company approached police following which an FIR was registered and a probe was launched. The investigation reportedly revealed that owner of a farm, through which the oil pipeline passed, was also involved in this crime.“Sachin and Ashok sold the stolen oil to Prashant, Anil and Karambir at cheap prices, who further sold it to others,” the police spokesperson said. “Prashant has a petrol pump on Sonepat Road in Rohtak, while Anil runs a rented pump in Jhajjar. Sachin and Ashok have stolen oil worth lakhs from the pipeline,” the spokesperson added. The police are now trying to nab the absconding gang members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gang-of-fuel-thieves-busted-in-haryana-7-arrested/story-FhwbffDKNPZ1ETIzsuWHUP.html

They have left no stone unturned to make their voices heard and said they won’t send their children to school unless it’s safe.

So many parents are calling and showing their concern regarding this daily.”A petition started by an anonymous parents’ association on Change.org claims to have gathered over 4 lakh signatories within 24 hours against the reopening. The petition addressed to Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, human resource and development minister, states, “Reopening schools in July will be the worst decision by the government. The current academic session should continue online.”A Tik-Tok video is also doing the rounds on social media in which parents appealed that Parliament should open before schools as their “Kids are not test samples”.Suresh Bhura, a parent said, “Currently, kids are at home and that is definitely an academic loss. However, I am against the reopening of schools amid surging cases of Covid-19. Crowded classrooms and lack of basic hygiene is the main concern.”Harvinder Singh, another parent said, “Government will do a trial-run on higher secondary classes only, whereas everything (otherwise) will be up to ‘god’.” Yuvraj Singh shared similar views and said it seems like children are being used as test samples.“Despite all norms pertaining to social distancing and sanitisation, controlling and managing children in schools is a problem. The schools needs detailed standard operating procedures (SOPs),” another parent, Ashwinder Singh said.Rubinder Kaur, another parent said, “I am not going to send my precious child to school. We can think after a vaccine is formulated or there are zero cases in Chandigarh.”Anita Karwal, secretary of school education and literacy, ministry of human resource development (MHRD), will hold a video conference with representatives of all states and UTs on reopening of schools, on Tuesday. Based on the meeting, the feedback of stakeholders will be taken into account, as per sources.

The wheat farmers have only been paid ₹1,600 crore out of the total payment for wheat procurement amounting to ₹16,000 crore. Around 60% of farmers who sold their wheat crop in the mandis have been waiting for their payment for the last 25 days”, the MLA added.He also alleged that the government had procured only 75 lakh metric tonnes of wheat as against last year’s 95 lakh metric tonnes.“The contractors are charging ₹5 per bag from the commission agents for lifting the procured wheat and mustard which is a scam worth ₹800 crore. Farmers are being forced to sell their produce at a deduction of two to three kilograms per quintal in the name of moisture content. If the government will not make payment to them in the next seven days, we will hold a dharna again to voice their concern,” Abhay added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/inld-holds-protest-against-delay-in-payment-to-farmers-in-haryana/story-13JQREsuHvcVi7nOE25ELO.html

I learnt that the Indian government is allowing those stuck here to reach Pakistan via Attari. So, I reached Attari but was arrested. I’m in love with a girl from Karachi and she would have married me if I had reached there. For past seven months, we are in touch. If I don’t reach there, her parents will get her married to someone else.”He said that he was aware of the risk of being caught and has appealed to the Indian government to allow him to visit Pakistan once.Police have registered a case under Section 14 of the Foreign Act against the accused.

Fadnavis has alleged that PFI is known for anti-national and anti-social activities and is likely to face a ban in states like Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Jharkhand.“Why is the BMC giving legitimacy to this tainted organisation? Is chief minister Uddhav Thackeray aware of it? PFI has faced allegations of anti-national and anti-social activities including its role in fanning the Citizen Amendment Act (CAA) protests. The Enforcement Directorate is investigating this organization and its funding sources,’’ said Fadnavis. He also tweeted, “How did the alleged anti national and anti social organization PFI get work in BMC ?”He added that the civic body is endorsing the organisation by giving them work.The former CM circulated a BMC circular dated May 18 by its public health department in the media that says that PFI task force’s four coordinators have to be informed about Covid-19 deaths or suspected Covid-19 deaths of Muslim patients. “Task force team from Popular Front India will facilitate the burial of Muslim bodies, in case of a dispute,’’ states the circular.

The state government has failed to pay PSPCL the full subsidy amount in last five fiscals.In the revised tariff order, the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) has calculated ₹10,621 crore against the subsidy bill for free power to the agricultural sector, industry and other consumers. The PSERC calculated the accumulated subsidy payable by Punjab government at ₹16,400.3, including ₹5,779.05 crore due for the previous fiscal.Of ₹10,621 crore subsidy calculated by the PSERC for 2020-21 fiscal, ₹7,180 crore account for agricultural sector,₹1,927 crore for industry, and ₹1,512 crore for domestic consumers belonging to Schedule Castes, Backward Classes and below poverty line (BPL) families.Free power to farmers is the fulcrum of Punjab politics and political party is willing to bite the bullet of doing away with this freebie. Last week, the Punjab government first agreed to implement the central government’s direction on paying subsidy amount directly to the farmer, but it took a U-turn after strong opposition.The PSERC has ordered the Punjab government to pay ₹1,268.6 crore subsidy amount each for April and May 2020. After the implementation of new tariff rates from June 1, the balance subsidy amount of ₹13,863.1 crore is required to be paid in advance in 10 monthly instalments of ₹1,386.31 crore for the period from June to March 2021.Meanwhile, as per the budgetary estimates, the Punjab government has only earmarked ₹12,246 crore in its budget for power subsidy, but now it has to pay ₹4,000 crore more as per the final order of the PSERC for 2020-21 tariff.The government has paid only ₹1,041 crore subsidy amount in advance to the PSPCL for the first two month of the current fiscal.“Punjab government and PSPCL are caught in a vicious circle due to power subsidy. The government can’t back out from its promise, while it has not enough money to pay full subsidy amount to the power corporation. This is happening for five years. PSPCL then takes loan to meet its budget and burden of interest is passed on to the consumers,” said VK Gupta, spokesman of All India Power Employees’ Federation.Blurb: State government has failed to pay PSPCL the full subsidy amount in last five fiscals||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-16-400-cr-power-subsidy-bill-stands-at-10-of-punjab-budget/story-4UMZtdEepmvDLtxviKrrhL.html

His nephew, Rajan, 24, was the first to spot the body as he visited the mill on Tuesday morning in search of his uncle.A resident of Shanti Nagar, Manimajra, Rajan sounded the police, and told them that a Nayagaon man had threatened to kill his uncle.AADHAAR CARD, CCTV FOOTAGE NAILED ACCUSED On searching the crime scene, police found Karan’s Aadhaar card on the spot. The mill’s CCTV footage also showed him arguing with Rawat, while holding a liquor bottle, which led to his arrest, police said.They said Karan was earlier working at Chunni Lal Dabha at Aare Wali Gali near the saw mill. After Karan left this job, Rawat helped him open up a tea stall near the electricity office in Motor Market, Manimajra. On Monday, Karan visited the saw mill and offered liquor to Rawat, who turned it down.

With this expressway, travel time from Amritsar to Delhi international airport would be reduced to about four hours from the present nearly eight hours, the road, transport and highways minister said adding that the first phase of expressway would involve investment of about Rs 25,000 crore. “The proposed expressway will connect the holy cities of five gurus of Sikhism,” Gadkari said after finalising the alignment in a review meeting attended by Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and others.The road from Amritsar to Gurdaspur will also be fully developed and made completely signal-free, Gadkari said, adding that the greenfield alignment will not only provide shortest and alternative express connectivity to Amritsar but also to other religious centres of Sultanpur Lodhi, Goindwal Sahib, Khadoor Sahib as well as the recently developed Dera Baba Nanak/Kartarpur Sahib international corridor in Punjab.With this, there will be two options to travel to Gurdaspur onwards from Nakodar, i.e. via Amritsar or via Kartarpur (Jalandhar district). With the new development, the alignment, which was finalised earlier and bypassed Amritsar district, will remain intact.The ministry of road transport and highways said it has taken up development of the Delhi-Amritsar-Katra Expressway under Bharatmala Pariyojana. The alignment of the expressway was firmed up in January 2019 and the process of land acquisition was initiated. Recently, the issue of alignment of the expressway to Amritsar has been taken up by minister of food processing industries Harsimrat Kaur Badal, civil aviation and housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri with Gadkari, the ministry statement said.In order to discuss and resolve issue of alignment to Amritsar, a video-conferencing was held with Gadkari which was attended by the Punjab CM, Harsimrat, Hardeep Singh Puri, union minister of state Jitender Singh, union minister of state Gen V K Singh (retd), Rajya Sabha MP Shwait Malik, Amritsar MP Gurjeet Singh Aujla, former Punjab minister Anil Joshi, officials of the NHAI and other senior officers.The Jammu and Kashmir government had initially proposed the Delhi-Katra Expressway. However, Gadkari had envisaged that the proposed expressway would pass through Amritsar looking at religious importance of the city, where over four million tourists visit every year, and hence conceived Delhi-Amritsar-Katra Expressway under Bharatmala.Union minister Jitendra Singh said project will be ready in three years and was likely to become functional by 2023. This will reduce the road travel time from Katra to Delhi to around six-and-half hours and from Jammu to Delhi to about six hours, he said in a statement.The ministry statement reiterated that Amritsar was always an integral part of Delhi-Amritsar-Katra Expressway. From beginning, the expressway was proposed as combination of greenfield and brownfield alignment in two phases. A completely new projects is termed greenfield project, whereas the projects which are modified or upgraded are called brownfield projects.Gadkari also requested the Punjab government to provide requisite support to the NHAI to expedite land acquisition for the proposed expressway in the state.(With inputs from Jammu)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gadkari-green-lights-delhi-katra-expressway-with-amritsar-link/story-wmPlbyvkOBWsbcjoFHW0rL.html

This will reduce the road travel time from Katra to Delhi to around six and a half hours, and from Jammu to Delhi to just about six hours, he said in a statement issued here.After a meeting with Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari, Singh said, the 575km-long express road corridor will cost over ₹35,000 crore and it will connect Katra to Delhi via Amritsar. Enroute, the other important cities that it will touch include Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Ludhiana in Punjab and, Kathua and Jammu.It is pertinent to mention that Singh, who is a member of parliament (Lok Sabha) representing Katra Vaishno Devi, had been pursuing this project since 2015 and had for the first time about three and half years ago announced during a programme at Katra that he had submitted a proposal to this effect which had been accepted by the Gadkari but it would take time because of procedural issues like survey, land acquisition, forest clearance, etc.However, Singh said that after the completion of the survey by M/S Feedback Consultants Ltd, the process of acquisition of land is nearly complete in the Haryana part of the corridor and will now be taken up in the Punjab area and thereafter in the Jammu and Kashmir segment.The formal approval of the proposal had already been obtained from the Jammu and Kashmir administration and now it has also been obtained from the Punjab government.The unique feature of this road corridor is that it will connect the two holy cities of Katra and Amritsar, and at the same time also offer connectivity for some of the important religious shrines between the two destinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/katra-delhi-express-corridor-to-be-ready-in-three-years-union-minister-jitendra-singh/story-XS6dH5vkYoi7RIUZcZdU1I.html

This was revealed in data gathered in Himachal Pradesh Heart Attack Registry.About 36 hospitals in the state both in government and private sectors participated in collecting data on heart patients admitted in these hospitals to make the registry.The data also revealed that heart attack is about two-fold more common in men than women and on average annually 70 per one lakh population were getting a heart attack in the state and Hamirpur had the highest incidence of heart attacks. A heart attack is equally common in rural and urban populations.There was an average delay of about 13 hours from symptom onset to reporting in the hospitals. Only about 30% received life-saving medicine (thrombolytic drug), while rest of the 70% could not receive this medicine due to late reporting. About 8% of patients died during the index heart attack. The major reasons for late reporting were ignorance about symptoms of heart attack and long travelling time. In some of the cases even if patients reached the hospital in time the drug was not given as the attending medical officer on duty was not confident of the diagnosis.Head of cardiology PC Negi said that the data has been uploaded in a web-based data recording system designed by the IT cell of IGMC Shimla. The department of cardiology was the project coordinating centre where data received from these hospitals was analysed to provide information related to age and gender distribution of heart attack patients, district wise and rural-urban distribution of patients, those consuming tobacco, time delay from symptom onset to reporting hospital, treatment received during hospitalisation and death rates during index heart attack event.Taking this valuable information gathered in the registry the study has been designed to address the barriers in the implementation of lifesaving drugs in heart patients. The project was submitted to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for funding and has been approved, he added.He said that the STEMI care project has been started in the Shimla district from April and is being funded by ICMR New Delhi. This project is essentially designed to address the shortcoming seen at the patient level and at the system level in delivering care to patients as observed in the state heart attack registry.The project aims to overcome these barriers through community education about the symptoms of heart attack and the importance of seeking medical attention immediately without wasting precious time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/data-shows-8-of-100-heart-patients-in-himachal-are-younger-than-40-years/story-9TBo24pT22kYcnTeqiXxhI.html

The deceased was identified as Atul Khare, brother of Arvind Khare, a renowned doctor of Ayodhya, said police.Arvind had lodged an FIR of Atul’s disappearance with city kotwali of Ayodhya on Monday night, after the victim’s family couldn’t trace him for around seven hours.Senior superintendent of police (SSP), Ayodhya, Ashish Tewari said preliminary investigation hinted at the involvement of four people who were in a land dispute with the victim. He said two of the suspects were already in police custody and further interrogation was on.Atul Khare went missing after he left his house near Dilli Darwaza locality around 3pm on Monday and soon after his mobile phone was switched off. His brother Dr Arvind Khare and other family members staying in Lucknow kept trying to contact him, said the SSP. Later in the night, Dr Khare approached the police and informed about his brother’s disappearance.The SSP said the victim’s mobile phone was tracked and recovered from a labourer who found it lying in a garbage dump near the abandoned biscuit factory where his charred body was found near Hasan Katra Mirza locality at around 7 am on Tuesday.Spot examination suggested that the victim’s limbs were tied and he was tortured by the assailants before being murdered. The body was later burnt on the factory campus on Monday/Tuesday midnight, said another official privy to the investigation. The victim’s daughter, Charu Khare, too forwarded an application to the police accusing three persons of murder. These included a Lucknow-based property dealer, Nizam Ashraf Khan, and two local residents, Kallu and Shanu. Kallu’s residence was barely 250 metres from the factory from where the charred body was found, said police.She said the trio wanted to seal a land deal (family property) with his father at a very less price. They were mounting pressure on him when he turned down their proposal. The accused had even threatened her father with dire consequences a few months ago, alleged Charu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/charred-body-of-ayodhya-doc-s-brother-found-in-abandoned-factory/story-9jH8VMd5cd8eFkH4nxGBnK.html

We have decided to meet him again and if he still fails to provide a solution, the association will chalk out further plan of action.”Following the complaints of huge gatherings at the vegetable market near Jalandhar bypass, the district administration had on April 3 restricted the sale of vegetables and fruits at the mandi to three days a week – Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Only listed suppliers who sell vegetables to street vendors in the city’s 95 wards were issued passes to enter the market.Besides a six-day week mandi, the traders have also demanded that their customers, other than the vendors, should be allowed to enter the vegetable market.Working on their demands, the deputy commissioner had formed a three-member committee led by sub-divisional magistrate (West) Amrinder Malhi, but that too recommended not to allow mandi operations for six days a week till the lockdown is in effect.A market committee official said the administration is already struggling to manage the rush of visitors to the market and it has also failed to stop illegal entry of vendors and customers, resulting in huge gatherings amid the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-traders-to-meet-cabinet-minister-to-press-for-six-day-week-mandi/story-phVaTHXi8EhCkXJ3nXbJAO.html

02-06-2020||Mumbai||HC asks Centre to furnish data on Vande Bharat passengers who tested positive after disembarking||The Bombay high court (HC) directed the Centre on Tuesday to provide data on international evacuee passengers who were Covid-negative when they boarded the Vande Bharat special flights but tested positive after de-boarding in India. The query was raised while hearing a petition by an Air India pilot who complained that the airline had violated social distancing norms while bringing back those stranded abroad on the special flights. The court also directed all parties to the petition to file their written arguments by Wednesday evening and posted the matter for hearing on Thursday. A division bench of justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade, while hearing a petition filed by pilot Deven Kanani on Tuesday through video conferencing, was informed by senior advocate Tushar Mehta appearing for the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and Air India that the special flights followed all safety norms to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.Mehta submitted that Air India, DGCA and the ministry of civil aviation had taken all necessary precautions for passengers who were seated in the middle seat. He said that apart from the three-layered face masks provided to all passengers, the middle seat passengers were provided with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) like a face shield for the entire duration of the flights. Mehta added that an expert committee constituted to review social distancing norms on special flights had also expressed its satisfaction on the measures adopted, and hence the petitioner’s apprehensions were unfounded and the petition must be dismissed.In an earlier hearing, advocate Dr Abhinav Chandrachud, who along with advocates Arsh Misra and Kavita Anchan represented Air India, had submitted that the DGCA circular on social distancing norms was not applicable for unscheduled commercial flights and hence the petition was invalid.The Central government, through additional solicitor general Anil Singh, informed the court that though it was represented in the petition by the DGCA, it wants the ministry of civil aviation also to be impleaded in the petition, which the court said it would decide after hearing the application by the ministry.After hearing the submissions, HC sought to know from the Centre whether there was any data on evacuated passengers who were Covid-negative when they boarded the flight but were tested positive after disembarking. The court said that such data, if any, should be placed before it in the next hearing on Thursday morning. The HC also directed all parties to submit their written arguments by Wednesday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-asks-centre-to-furnish-data-on-air-india-passengers-who-tested-positive-after-disembarking/story-ZljuHxLpIbRtmEy1wC5hYI.html

The vigilance verified the authenticity of the clip and a preliminary probe suggested Gupta was involved in irregularities in the purchase of medical supplies and equipment.The vigilance has taken into possession documents pertaining to purchases made by the department since January 2020. “But the focus is on purchases made in March, particularly after the Covid-19 outbreak,” an investigator said, requesting anonymity.In April, the directorate of health services bought personal protective equipment (PPE), the safety gear required to protect health workers from exposure to novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.PPE KITS BOUGHT IN TWO PHASESUnlike other states, Himachal Pradesh does not have a specialised medical purchase corporation. A technical committee headed by Gupta was assigned the task of buying medical equipment for health workers on frontline duty. Usually, the equipment is bought by medical officers at the district level but the government authorised the health directorate to make purchases.In view of the health emergency due to the pandemic, the department bought PPE kits in two phases. The first set of 6,000 PPE kits was bought from a Chandigarh-based company for Rs 84 lakh. Each kit was bought for Rs 1,400.The state bought another 7,000 PPE kits from a Kurukshetra-based corporation for Rs 1,050 per piece and the total order amounted to Rs 73.5 lakh.The state had released an expression of interest letter on April 21 only to scrap it.FORENSIC REPORT IN THREE DAYSThe technical committee comprises four members, including the heads of departments from medical colleges, while the purchase committee includes four experts from the health department.“The vigilance department has questioned the members,” a health department official said.The vigilance department seized the mobile phones of Dr Ajay Gupta and liaison officer Prithvi Singh of a Punjab-based medical supplier. Prithvi Singh had worked for a diagnostic laboratory in Solan, owned by relatives of former state BJP president Rajeev Bindal.Bindal stepped down after his name was dragged into the scam. The vigilance is awaiting the report from the forensic laboratory on the voice samples of the both Ajay Gupta and Prithvi Singh. The state forensic science laboratory in Junga is likely to submit its report within three days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/vigilance-questions-technical-purchase-committees-in-himachal-medical-equipment-scam/story-bKPPBXPB7lRvCpR6lsiNIP.html

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has declared Nisarga as a cyclonic storm. It said that the tropical storm which started as a low-pressure area in the Arabian Sea, turned into a cyclone on Tuesday afternoon. It is expected to make a landfall very close to Alibagh, 94 km south of Mumbai, on the afternoon of June 3. Scientist said the cyclone could inundate low-lying areas especially in cities like Mumbai and cause damage from falling trees and power poles. This had raised concerns about how Mumbai, among the worst-affected in the country by the coronavirus disease, will cope. Mumbai’s civic body, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), has also advised people to stay away from the sea and not stand under trees and power poles. The civic body’s advisory has also asked Mumbaikars not to step out of their houses.The BMC’s official handle tweeted, “A cyclone is expected to hit western coast of Maharashtra on June 3. All precautions are being taken to ensure zero casualty, including relocating people from unsafe localities. In view of the situation, the main control room and ward control rooms of BMC have been equipped with adequate manpower. Citizens are requested to stay away from the sea and not stand under tree or pillar.”The civic agency has further directed all hospitals in the city to ensure that their generators are in working order and there is an uninterrupted power supply so that the treatment of patients is not affected in any manner. A senior health official said that Cyclone Nisarga is a major challenge for the health facilities while they are dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.(With inputs from HTC, Mumbai)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cyclone-nisarga-mumbai-civic-body-best-prepares-to-deal-with-power-supply-in-covid-hospitals/story-7kqg8Zukx2YIcDfsoRzpUJ.html

02-06-2020||Chandigarh||Revised MSPs fail to offer succour to farmers in Punjab||The Centre on Monday announced revised minimum support prices (MSPs) for Kharif crops, however, farmers, who were anticipating a financial bailout from the government, were let down by the paltry increments as the agricultural sector grapples with acute shortage of labour.The central ministry of agriculture announced the MSP for different crops on the recommendations of the commission for agricultural costs and prices (CACP). With an increase of Rs 53, the MSP of paddy (common) has been revised from Rs 1,815 to Rs 1,868, while Grade-A paddy will be bought for Rs 1,888 as compared to last year’s Rs 1,835.Effecting an increase of Rs 90, the MSP for maize has been increased from Rs 1,760 to Rs 1,850,The MSP of cotton (medium staple) has been increased by Rs 260. Now, cottons MSP is Rs 5,515 as compared to last year’s Rs 5,255.Economists, too, are of the opinion that the increase is too insufficient to offer any succour to the ailing agricultural sector.Noted economist Sardara Singh Johl says though he had observed that the concept of MSP hardly favours 84% of the small and marginal farmers, there should be a consistent increase in the crop pricing as the cost of the production has been increasing every year.MANIFOLD INCREASE IN INPUT COST “There will be manifold increase in the input cost of paddy sowing due to shortage of labour. The government should either further increase the MSP or provide some other assistance to farmers,” Johl said, adding that usually the commission adopts a scientific approach while proposing pricing, however this year it was not the case. “Farmers will have to depend on machines for paddy sowing or hire local labour, who are charging double than migrants, for manual sowing of the crop,” Johl said.Professor Kesar Singh Bhangoo, an economist at Punjabi university, said in the present scenario, the marginal increase in MSP will not serve any purpose. “With an increase of Rs 53 in paddy MSP, farmers should have an additional earning of Rs 1,560 by selling 30 quintals of production from an acre. However, this year, the cost of labour has doubled to almost Rs 5,500 from Rs 2,800 per acre (an increase of Rs 2,700),” Bhangoo said.Government intervention is crucial for agricultural labour and farmers at this juncture, he added.INCREASED MSP A ‘JOKE’: BKUFarmers say the government remains indifferent to the challenges being faced by the farming community due to the coronavirus crisis.Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugarahan) state president Joginder Singh dismissed the Rs 53 hike in paddy MSP as a ‘joke’.“We reject the increased MSP as it will not help farmers at all. The government has failed to calculate input cost of paddy cultivation and other expenses while tabulating the MSP,” he said.Farmers expect labour costs to double this year as while migrant workers charge Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000 per acre for sowing paddy, local labour in Punjab demands Rs 5,000-Rs 5,500 per acre.BKU general secretary (Dakaunda) Jagmohan Singh said the commission adopts an outdated method to determine MSP.“There is no check on inflation due to the Covid-19 crisis,” he said.Farmers have been asking the Centre to adopt the formula recommended by National Commission on Farmers chairperson MS Swaminathan, under which farmers will be provided an MSP which accounts for the basic costs incurred on production and an additional 50% profit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/revised-msps-fail-to-offer-succour-to-farmers-in-punjab/story-Dsa9LTZM1MBNEEkvSZHxiI.html

02-06-2020||Chandigarh||HT Explainer: Battle Royale for the riches||The high court on Monday ruled in favour of two daughters in the three-decade-long legal battle for the assets between members of Faridkot royal family. It also gave share to descendents of Maharaja’s brother. Surender Sharma dissects the issue to know what is at stake, the claimants and the road aheadThe dispute Faridkot’s last Maharaja Harinder Singh had three daughters — Amrit Kaur, Deepinder Kaur and Mahip Inder Kaur and one son, Harmohinder Singh. His son died in a road accident in 1981. Maharaja died in 1989 and soon after, a will purportedly signed by him surfaced in 1982, entrusting properties to a trust. His wife Narinder Kaur, mother Mohinder Kaur and Amrit Kaur feigned ignorance about the will. It had Deepinder Kaur and Mahip Inder Kaur as trust chairperson and vice-chairperson. Mahip Inder, a spinster, died in Shimla in 2001. Amrit Kaur had reportedly married against the wishes of Maharaja to a police officer, a reason cited for her exclusion.She filed a civil suit in 1992, challenging the will of her father. Her contention was that her father could not have legally bequeathed his entire estate to the trust because it was ancestral property governed by Hindu joint family law. Manjit Inder Singh, Harinder Singh’s brother, argued that as Maharaja’s son had died, the property should have been granted to the eldest living male blood relative.What is at stakeAs per lawyers, the properties are valued at more than ₹20,000 crore. It include Rajmahal in Faridkot, which is spread over 14 acres; Qila Mubarak built by Raja Mokulsi and reconstructed by Raja Hamir Singh around 1775; and Faridkot House on Copernicus Marg in New Delhi. Other properties include Manimajra Fort, Chandigarh, spread over four acres, Faridkot House in Mashobra (Shimla, a 260-bigha estate); 18 vintage cars; aerodrome in Faridkot, which is spread over 200 acres, and gold and jewels valued at ₹1,000 crore in Standard Chartered Bank’s custody in Mumbai.The will and the verdict The will which entrusted properties of Maharaja was purportedly signed in 1982 but surfaced in 1989 after his death. It had Deepinder and Mahip Inder Kaur at the helm, and a large number of employees as custodians. The court observed that the locker from where the will was recovered was operated by the Raja personally then how an employee of Raja opened the same without informing others. Also it was natural for him to inform his near and dear ones about such an important document, but none knew about it. Also, why the executors did not make any inventory of movable and immovable properties of Raja, nor they performed any obligation mandatorily required under Indian Succession Act. Another aspect noted by court is that why Raja would disinherit his unmarried daughter, his wife and mother in the will.Now what As per lawyers, 37.5% of share goes to both the daughters and 25% to Bharat Inder Singh. The appeal against the dispute, which started in 1992, lies in Supreme Court now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ht-explainer-battle-royale-for-the-riches/story-bWvYZGuW4hlLgDty8q5g6O.html

The court also held that descendents of Manjit Inder Singh, brother of the Maharaja, would get their mother Mohinder Kaur’s share.Crowned at the age of three in 1918, Harinder was the last ruler of the Faridkot estate and was married to Narinder Kaur. The royal couple had three daughters, Amrit Kaur, Deepinder Kaur and Maheepinder Kaur and one son, Harmohinder Singh. The son died in a road accident in 1981. One of the Maharajas of seven Sikh princely, Harinder died in 1989 and left behind prime properties in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Haryana and Chandigarh.Maharawal Khewaji Trust explore legal optionsAfter facing a second setback in a 28-year-long fight for the royal inheritance of the property, the Maharawal Khewaji Trust will look for options to challenge the Punjab and Haryana high court order.Maharawal Khewaji Trust chief executive Jagir Singh Saran said: “We have received the copy of the order and a team of advocates is looking into it and a decision will be taken accordingly.Two lawyers associated with the case, senior advocate MS Khaira and Vivek Bhandari said the properties are worth over ₹20, 000 crore. As per the judgment, 37.5% share would go to each of the two daughters and 25% to the family of Bharat Inder Singh.Maheepinder Kaur died a spinster, Deepinder Kaur died while this legal battle was on. Amrit Kaur lives in Chandigarh.The property dispute started soon after Maharaja died in October 1989 after a ‘will’ surfaced, in which he had bequeathed his properties to the trust, Maharwal Khewaji Trust, with his daughter Deepinder Kaur as its head.As of high court, the matter had reached in 2018 after a Chandigarh court declared trust as void and gave property to the daughters.The asset tussleOct 1989: Maharaja Harinder Singh dies. ‘Will’ bequeathing his properties to a trust surfacesOct 1992: Daughter Amrit Kaur files civil suit demanding 1/3 of share in propertyJuly 2013: A Chandigarh court rules that 1982 will was forged. Says as per Hindu Succession Act, properties would go to both the sisters, appeals filed against the orderFeb 2018: An additional sessions court upholds civil court order, appeals filed in HC by all partiesThe high court bench of justice Raj Mohan Singh held that property would be inherited as per Hindu Succession Act— by both the daughters and their mother. Since mother Mohinder Kaur was alive at the time of death of Maharaja, she would also inherit the property and now would go to family of Manjit Inder Singh as per her will.Amrit Kaur had staked claim on the entire estate on the basis of The Raja of Faridkot’s Estate Act, 1948. Bharat Inder Singh had staked claim on inheritance on the basis of rule of Primogeniture according to which property rights are granted to first born son or eldest living male blood relative. Deepinder Kaur had staked claim on the basis of validity of the will and trust created.The court held that Estate Act, 1948 was not a valid enactment after commencement of Constitution of India and is not applicable for succession to the estate. As of rule of primogeniture, the court said, the succession has to be governed by the personal law of succession. Even rights and privileges conferred upon the ruler, came to an end with his death, being purely personal in character, it said.As of the will in dispute, the court observed, trustees conspired to create the will to take over the property. “The will is proved to be forged, fictitious, fabricated and shrouded with suspicious circumstances..,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-verdict-on-faridkot-royals-property-dispute-daughters-to-get-lion-s-share-in-property/story-JFlrckoupQRjRcTQ7OqTAM.html

02-06-2020||Dehradun||On Day 1, confusion prevails in state over curbs, relaxations||The first day on Unlock 1.0 witnessed mixed reactions from people across the state as districts in red and orange zones were confused on what was allowed, while people from districts in green zone said that the relaxations are the same as Lockdown 4.0Nainital district was declared as red zone by Uttarakhand government on Sunday which led to confusion among people regarding the relaxations available and restrictions for the red zone on the first day of Unlock 1.0.Locals had hoped that business activity will be increased but with the district being categorized as the red zone, shops were allowed to stay open till 4 pm only.Most people were confused about moving from one district to another and were sceptical about travelling by car.Rohit Pandey, a drug trader, said “We need to supply goods to the hilly areas but due being in the red zone, we are not able to decide whether to go or not. The district administration should tell the public in detail about all the restrictions and exemptions of red zones.”Kundan Bisht, an employee with a private firm, said “I have to go to Rudrapur in Udham Singh Nagar district for my job, but as Nainital district is under red zone I am confused whether to go to my job or not.”In Dehradun, the city roads were full of traffic and most markets witnessed a good rush of customers.“We are happy that finally, life seems to be returning to some normalcy here. We are hoping that now the economy here stabilizes and people attend to their life as usual”, said Dheerinder Sharma, a private employee from Dehradun’s DalanwalaIn Haridwar , locals were seen thronging the Ganga ghats on the pious festive occasion of Ganga Saptami but the markets in the city remained deserted with many shopkeepers closing their establishments by late afternoon as fewer customers were seen in the markets.Vipin Gupta, president of City Trader Division, Jwalapur said that markets in suburban Jwalapur did not witness a major change as far rush is concerned, with fewer non-essential buyers arriving at markets.In Udham Singh Nagar district, the only green zone district in the state, people said that Unlock 1.0 was like an illusion.“Unlock-1.0 is just like an illusion for me, because there is no relief either for industries or trade. Industries are not on the priority list of the state government. All guidelines that are to be followed are the same as Lockdown-4.0. Earlier, we did not need e-passes to go to other districts but now we have to obtain that,” said Ashok Bansal, an industrialist from Rudrapur.Markets of Khatima, Sitarganj, Kichha, Gadarpur, Bazpur, Kashipur and Jaspur witnessed customers as usual.In Pithoragarh district markets closed around 2 pm despite administration allowing shops to remain open from 7 am-7 pm.Pithoragarh Vyapar Sangh, the traders’ union in the district, asked traders to close shops after 2 pm.“As the migrants who reached the district are roaming around the district headquarter markets, we cannot afford our shopkeepers to get affected by the deadly virus. Therefore, we have suggested the traders to shut down their shops by 2 pm and continue the practice till the pandemic situation improves,” said Shamsher Singh Mahar, president of Vyapar Sangh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/on-day-1-confusion-prevails-in-state-over-curbs-relaxations/story-BHAGIYyG8t5jAvFvFCc7ON.html

With nine cases, Sheohar has reported the least number of infections so far.Although the state had reported its first couple of cases in March, more than 3,000 people tested positive in May, the spike attributed mainly to the massive influx of migrants by special trains and other modes of transport.According to data released by the health department, the number of migrants who have tested positive for the disease since May 3 is 2,743.Although the migrants testing positive include returnees from 24 states, a majority of them have come back from Maharashtra (677), Delhi (628), Gujarat (405), Haryana (237), Uttar Pradesh (149), Rajasthan (126), West Bengal (107), Telangana (104) and Punjab (81).Altogether 1,741 Covid-19 patients have recovered in the state so far while the number of samples tested till date is 78,090.Anupam Kumar, Secretary in the Information and Public Relations Department, told a media briefing that the process of bringing back migrants was “almost complete”, a reason why there has been a drop in the number of Shramik Special trains.Winding up of the quarantine centres at the block level is proposed by June 15, he said.The official said with most of the lockdown restrictions being relaxed, the state will now keep an eye on observance of social distancing at public places.Additional Director General of Police (Headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said the people of the state coughed up a staggering Rs 20.42 crore towards fines imposed for violating the lockdown, which ended on Sunday. The number of arrests made was 2,442, while 2,260 FIRs were registered.As many as 85,345 vehicles were seized during the 67-day period for plying without observing the lockdown guidelines, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/covid-19-bihar-reports-138-fresh-cases-2-more-deaths/story-RdhHEVIJyGkBm5bG02TdHJ.html

This is the fifth swarm to enter the state in four days from its western border with Pakistan. Since the first locust swarm invaded the state’s Sriganganagar district from Pakistan’s Baluchistan on April 11, as many as 25 swarms have entered Rajasthan, said Locust Warning Office deputy director L K Gurjar.“It was a small swarm, and spread across 1km-by-1km,” Suwa Lal Jat, joint director of plant protection in Rajasthan’s agriculture department said on Monday. “On May 30, three swarms came from Pakistan into Ganganagar, Bikaner and Jodhpur; earlier, a swarm entered Hanumangarh on May 26,” he said.On Sunday evening, a swarm also entered two villages of Chhattisgarh in Koriya district bordering Madhya Pradesh after which agriculture departments in Jharkhand and Odisha issued advisories to farmers asking them to be in high alert.Koriya district collector DM Rathore said, “On Sunday, it was small swarm and we managed to contain their movement by spraying chemicals and using sirens of fire brigades. Most of them have died. We have not been affected till now.”On May 27, the Chhattisgarh agriculture department and farmers in districts bordering Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra were alerted after swarms of locusts attacked crops in the neighbouring states.“Every bordering district of Chhattisgarh is on alert,” said Principal Secretary Agriculture Maninder Kaur Dwivedi. “Earlier Bhandara (Maharashtra) locust swarm was expected to arrive in Kawadha district but the wind changed direction so it went towards Nagpur. On Friday, a swarm of locust which was reported in Balaghat and Mandla districts of (Madhya Pradesh) and it went towards Mirzapur (Uttar Pradesh). On Sunday one of swarms reached Koriya,” he said.According to the agriculture ministry, locusts have so far damaged crops in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Chhattisgarh. Another 12 states have been asked to be on alert and prepare for locust control measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/new-swarm-of-locusts-invades-rajasthan-fifth-to-enter-state-in-4-days/story-1TfVuYww0ecNFlrYKjkLuI.html

02-06-2020||Chandigarh||Finally, Punjab set to start mobile sample collection this week||After a delay of nearly one month, the Punjab government is finally set to launch the RT-PCR mobile sample collection facility for Covid-19 this week. The 26 mobile vans the state health department had hired for the purpose a month back were not deployed for testing due to a decision taken by the high-ups. “The vans will have technical staff and will move in areas like marketplaces, vegetable markets, and villages to collect samples of all symptomatic people. Nothing will be charged for this. We are going to launch the facility in a couple of days,” said Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, state health department’s nodal officer for Covid-19. The vans will collect nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs that will be sent to a testing facility.“It will help the staff collecting samples save time. Initially, the vans will operate for eight hours but the duration can be increased or decreased as per the requirement,” said the nodal officer.For now, one van will be deployed in each district.Why the delay?Even as many states launched RT-PCR mobile testing in the last week of April, Punjab delayed it on the recommendations of a high-powered committee.“We initially wanted to test the targeted population only. But with opening up of the lockdown, chances are that community spread will increase. It is the right time to launch this facility. There are chances of large-scale mutation of the virus now,” a senior health department official said.Lack of trained technical staff is also said to be one of the reasons behind holding back the launch of the facility. “Temporary staff has been hired for the purpose. Technicians and laboratories are not an issue,” the official said. 195 cases in past one weekAfter a thaw for a few days, Punjab has once again started seeing rise in the number of coronavirus cases with 195 people found infected in the past one week.Of the new patients, around 100 are those who came from other states or abroad and were in institutional quarantine.On a positive note, the state continues to have the best recovery rate in the country at 87%.

The district has been issued a red alert, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting extremely heavy rain in the district on Wednesday.“Despite warning, 577 boats from Palghar district had ventured into the sea, of which 477 have returned to the base. Around 100 boats, with 1,000 khalasis (fisherfolk) are stranded in the sea and we are coordinating with the Coast Guard to ensure their safety,” said Shinde. He said that the authorities have been unable to establish contact with the stranded fishermen. “The wireless systems are not working and the Coast Guard are using satellite phones to contact the fishermen stranded at sea,” said Shinde. For the next four days, fishermen from Dahanu, Palghar,Vasai and Talasari have been warned against venturing into the seas owing to the cyclone. “We have invoked section 144 of IPC in the district. We have also asked commercial establishments to remain closed for a day. Our priority is to ensure minimum loss of lives,” Shinde added.The district authorities are coordinating with Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), public works, fisheries, police and other departments to avert any major mishap. “We are conducting a survey of all kutcha (thatched) houses in the district and are shifting the elderly, pregnant women and children to shelter homes in government schools in the district,” Shinde said. The district authority has also requested locals to remain prepared for a power outage. A low pressure area has been formed over the southeast and east central Arabian Sea and the IMD has predicted that the cyclone will intensify by 2 June. The cyclonic storm will move towards South Gujarat and North Maharashtra by 3 June. The district could receive rainfall of 150-200 mm on 3 June, alongwith Srivardhan, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Raigad districts in the Konkan. Parts of Gujarat such as Anand, Surat, Bharuch,Valsad, till Daman will also receive heavy rainfall,said Dr Shinde.“We are also preparing for a possible threat of landslides, as due the first rains, the soil becomes lose,resulting in the landslides,” Shinde said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-ndrf-teams-in-palghar-100-boats-stranded/story-8YxdaLCo98aI0aXacmYoaM.html
02-06-2020||Mumbai||Cyclone Nisarga: Expect heavy rain in Mumbai, Thane on Wednesday||Cyclone Nisarga, a developing tropical cyclonic storm in the Arabian Sea, is likely to make landfall south of Mumbai, said the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Monday evening. While a ‘red alert’ has been issued for Mumbai and Thane districts for June 3, IMD said the conditions may change over the next 48 hours. On Monday, the depression lay 310 km southwest of Panjim in Goa, 570 km south-southwest of Mumbai in Maharashtra and 800 km south-southwest of Surat in Gujarat.According to IMD’s updated bulletin, the approaching weather system is expected to become a cyclonic storm by 5.30am today and a severe cyclonic storm by 5.30pm. Maximum winds are expected to range between 105-115 kilometres per hour (kmph), gusting to 125kmph around the point of landfall as the weather system moves over east-central and northeast Arabian Sea, along and off the Maharashtra coast (Raigad, Mumbai, Palghar, Thane). It is expected to make landfall by Wednesday afternoon. Earlier on Monday, IMD had predicted the cyclone would make landfall north of the city, in Palghar district, but revised its forecast in the evening. “Landfall is expected towards the south of Mumbai. Since the Arabian Sea system is dynamic, there are a few predictability issues. There might be further changes in the coming 48 hours,” said Sunitha Devi, in-charge of cyclones at IMD. “As of now we are keeping the area under impact of the cyclone from Daman in the north to Harihareshwar in Raigad in the south. It will pass over this region as a severe cyclone, but there is a marginal reduction in wind speed expected. Mumbai is likely to experience high speed winds as the cyclone makes landfall south of the city,” she said.IMD Mumbai on Monday issued a red alert (rainfall of more than 204.5mm) for Mumbai, Thane, and Raigad for June 3 (Wednesday). A red alert has been issued for Palghar for June 3 and 4. People in the areas under red alert are directed to take action to keep safe from adverse impacts of predicted weather. While a yellow alert (light to moderate rain) was issued for all four districts for Tuesday, an orange alert (be prepared — heavy rain warning) may be issued for Mumbai, Thane and Raigad for June 4 (Thursday). A red alert has been issued for Dhule, Nandurbar and Nashik for June 3.Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD, said, “Palghar, Thane, Mumbai and Raigad are the most important districts that will be affected by this severe cyclonic storm where we are expecting tree fall or property damage. A more detailed list of expected damages will be shared soon..”Mahesh Narvekar, chief officer, disaster management cell, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said, “Based on continuous updates being received from IMD, our preparation to handle the situation is underway.” Another BMC officer said warnings have been issued to the fishing community and officers were checking on Covid-19 care centres.Independent meteorologists also said the system is expected to cross south of Mumbai on the morning of June 3, around 9am. “The wind speed along with rough sea conditions in the landfall region will be capable of damaging weak structures (such as huts), affecting poor people and fishermen who live at the coastline,” said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and researcher at University of Reading.Meanwhile, even as Maharashtra braced for the impact of a cyclone within 48 hours, the IMD’s Doppler weather radar was dysfunctional throughout Monday morning. The radar located at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Colaba can carry out weather surveillance at distance of 300 km radius from its location. The radar provides long-range weather surveillance, detection and forecast for rainfall, cloud formation, thunderstorms and other weather conditions such as tropical storms. “There was maintenance work underway on the roof where the Doppler radar is located on Monday. However the work was completed by afternoon and the radar was working from 5pm onwards,” said a senior IMD official. The Doppler radar was down on December 4, 2017 when Cyclone Ockhi brushed past the Mumbai coast. During June and July last year, when the city witnessed extremely heavy rain, the Doppler radar was dysfunctional on both days due to technical difficulties. The radar is very useful for better monitoring of cloud developments, thunderstorms and rainfall on a real-time basis||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/expect-heavy-rain-in-mumbai-thane-on-wednesday-imd/story-SlY081vMB5upu0vFg01P3O.html
02-06-2020||Mumbai||Cyclone Nisarga: Rise in sea temperatures could lead to more pre-rain cyclonic storms, say experts||With the formation of Cyclone Amphan in Bay of Bengal, followed by the likely formation of Cyclone Nisarga in Arabian Sea within two weeks, scientists have warned about the possibility of more pre-monsoon cyclonic storms in coming years due to warmer ocean temperatures.Dr Roxy Mathew Koll, senior scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), said, “We are aware that post-monsoon cyclones have increased, but climate models and projections are indicating the likelihood of more cyclones before the onset of the southwest monsoon in the Arabian Sea.”Sea surface temperatures in the Arabian Sea were plotted on a map, showing the difference between long-term average temperatures and temperatures on May 30, even as the weather system that is yet to intensify into Cyclone Nisarga developed.“While the temperatures in the Bay of Bengal, were between 30-33 degrees Celsius prior to Amphan, surface temperatures over the Arabian Sea recorded 30-32 degrees Celsius prior to the depression which is now evolving as cyclone Nisarga. Such high temperatures aid rapid intensification of these cyclonic systems, which many weather models fail to capture,” Koll said.According to IITM, sea surface temperatures between 24 and 26 degrees Celsius are normal.The India Meteorological Department (IMD), however, said that higher ocean temperatures were not a factor for the intensification of Cyclone Nisarga.“During Amphan, warmer oceans allowed the system to reach a super cyclone status but not in this case so far,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general, IMD.Warmer ocean temperatures are not the only parameter for rapid intensification of cyclones, said Mohapatra. “We need to consider other parameters, such as relative humidity in middle troposphere and instability in the atmosphere, allowing moist air to form aiding cloud formation through the help of convection. There are also other dynamic parameters to be considered. However, the frequency of cyclones has been abnormally high in the Arabian Sea from the past one year and it is a fact that this zone is witnessing an increase in cyclones,” said Mohapatra.Owing to rising sea surface temperatures, rapid intensification of these weather systems are being observed, added Dr Koll.“What is more surprising is that the models are unable to pick up the rapid intensification of these systems. In case of Amphan and Nisarga, we saw that atmospheric conditions were not that favourable and may not develop into a cyclone, but warm ocean conditions are helping convection and allowing these systems to intensify faster into full-blown cyclones even during pre-monsoon period,” he said, adding that these were not conclusive results but indications were clear.Last year, the Arabian Sea had recorded five cyclones, equalling a 117-year-old record, according to data from IMD. Cyclone Vayu, a very severe cyclonic storm, was witnessed from June 10-17 last year, while Cyclone Hikka, a very severe cyclonic storm, was seen in September 22-25. In October and November, India had witnessed twin cyclones Kyarr and Maha, which was a rare event according to IMD, while Cyclone Pawan was formed in December. Flooding inevitable in low-lying areas: Ex-IMD DGFormer IMD director general (DGG) Dr KJ Ramesh said the predicted landfall dates of June 3 by IMD is in close proximity to the full moon date of June 6. “Three to four days before the full moon, the gravitational effect of moon and earth will be high, which means the wave action will be at the high- tide level. The storm surge will be over, resulting in large-scale flooding across several low-lying areas, up to the high-tide line. Wind speed of 80 kilometre per hour (kmph) and above will be more than enough to cause massive damage. This will be applicable from south Gujarat up to Raigad, and efforts to safeguard infrastructure have to be considered,” he said.Mumbai at highest risk as cyclones become the new normal: Climate scientistOne of the authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC’s) special report on Ocean and Cryosphere pointed out that warming of oceans is the main factor for increasing the intensity and occurrence of tropical cyclones, especially in the Arabian Sea. “The most-affected city is Mumbai,” said Dr Anjal Prakash, research director and adjunct associate professor, Bharti Institute of Public Policy, Indian School of Business, Hyderabad Campus. He highlighted concerns raised by the Madhav Chitale committee after the July 2005 deluge. “The committee reiterated the reasons of the flooding which was known earlier – inadequate drainage system, rapid developments and loss of ponds that used to hold water, encroachment by the slums on and over the existing drainage systems, and reduction in the coastal mangrove areas. These are the adaptation measures which Mumbai must focus on,” he said, adding that the combination of the pandemic and extreme weather events could be dangerous, especially for slum residents living in low-lying areas of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rise-in-temperatures-could-lead-to-more-pre-rain-cyclonic-storms/story-gKxzlFjPHXsCXVowTk9FWI.html

The officers of the Indian Territorial Army are helping the people with ration and hygiene kits during lockdown. Till date, they have distributed 4,500 kits in areas such as Kamathipura, Falkland road and other areas like Sion Agripada, Cotton Green, Charni Road and Kandivli.Captain Neil Shaji, Major Sanjay Raole and Major Pradeep Arya belong to the Indian Territorial Army, which is a part of the regular Indian Army but consists of civilians who apart from their regular jobs work for the Indian Army for a few months every year.“As we belong to the Army, I think it is our duty to provide help in areas which are difficult for civilians to reach to,” said Captain Shaji, who was undertaking a distribution drive in Dharavi on Friday. He is also a strategy consultant and works in the army for two months every year.The officers have provided hygiene and ration kits which they say will suffice a family of four for more than 10-15 days. The ration kit consists of 5 kg of wheat flour, 5 kg of rice, 2 kg of tur dal, 200 grams of turmeric powder, and chilli powder. The hygiene kits consist of three soaps, two soaps for washing clothes, hand wash and sanitary napkins.“These are communities which are largely ignored by the society, so we wanted to help them in our best way possible,” said Major Raole, who also owns a company.The officers took help from NGOs like Prerna Foundation, Apne Aap Collective, Rescue Foundation for their work for the sex workers and Arzoo Foundation to provide assistance to the transgender community.

The tropical cyclone is expected to make landfall south of Mumbai on June 3.Sixteen teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), comprising 45 jawans each, are on alert in the state. While 10 teams have been deployed, six are on standby. Three teams have been deployed in Mumbai, two in Palghar, two in Raigad and one each in Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri and Thane, a state official confirmed.Kishor Nimbalkar, secretary, relief and rehabilitation, said, “We are taking all measures and precautions to tackle the situation. There is no need to worry. The districts along the coast have been put on alert and we have also alerted NDRF.”A state official, on condition of anonymity, said, “We might deploy more by Tuesday afternoon. We will also get a clearer picture about the intensity and landfall by Tuesday afternoon.”Collectors in the seven districts have been instructed to shift all informal settlements as well as people living in homes with thatched roofs along the shoreline. The state has also said that those shifted to relief centres must adhere to physical distancing norms, owing to the Covid-19 outbreak.While Maharashtra government on Sunday had said beaches may open from June 3, the official said it is standard operating procedure (SOP) to close down beaches during a cyclone. The state may issue an order to close down beaches on Wednesday, owing to the cyclone.He also said that though 90% of fishermen have returned to base, many from Palghar are still out at sea. While 577 boats from Palghar district had ventured out, only 477 have returned, collector Kailash Shinde said. The collector has asked fishermen from Dahanu, Palghar, Vasai, and Talasari to not venture out. Industries, shops and commercial establishments have also been shut for a day.Palghar collector Kailash Shinde said, “We have started making announcements near the shoreline. We have also asked power stations to be on alert in case of an emergency. All beaches will also be closed and we are also considering imposing section 144 to prevent any sort of crowding near beaches.”Each district already has a disaster management plan to tackle natural or man-made disasters. The district-wise disaster management plan has detailed information about the geography of the area, the demographics and SOPs to be put in place with regard to major disasters like floods and other natural calamities. It also has details on the number of fire brigades, police stations, hospitals and health centres that need to be alerted in case of emergencies. The collectors are expected to modify the disaster management plan as per the latest developments in order to respond to the situation most effectively, and activate the plans. Collectors are expected to activate these plans this morning.In Mumbai city and suburbs, 11 teams that are adept at flood response in low-lying areas, 94 lifeguards at different beaches, and three NDRF teams are on alert. PS Rahangdale, chief fire officer of Mumbai Fire Brigade and deputy municipal commissioner of the city’s department of disaster management, said, “Altogether a team of 200 people are on high alert. We have also been undertaking periodic maintenance of equipment for a smoother response.”In his live address to the state on Sunday night, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had also asked fishermen along the stretch between Sindhudurg and Mumbai to not venture close to the shore. The state has an outlay of Rs 1,611 crore under its State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), from which funds are drawn for natural calamities such as cyclones. The Central government is expected to take up a share of 75% of the outlay. According to an official from the relief and rehabilitation department, district collectors are delegated power to use these funds in case of calamities.“Every district has its own fund reserved for natural calamities with collectors given standing powers to draw money [from it]. The district disaster management authorities headed by collectors follow SOPs prepared for evacuation and rehabilitation in case of calamities,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cyclone-nisarg-16-ndrf-teams-on-alert-in-state/story-ylsyWWJlvpjGW73C5uBPfP.html
02-06-2020||Mumbai||Was there a cyclone in Mumbai in 1882?||Cyclone Nisarga, which is expected to make landfall on June 3, is an unprecedented weather event for Mumbai. The last time a cyclone hit the city, according to newspaper articles, was back on June 6, 1882, when the Great Bombay Cyclone reportedly led to the loss of 1 lakh people. However, experts have questioned the accuracy of those old reports. A May 2019 study by America’s Columbia University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) concluded that the 1882 cyclone was a hoax.“The India Meteorological Department (IMD) maintains archives of cyclone tracks as well as daily weather summaries from 1877-1970 for both the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. Maps are available in particular for all cyclones … during the period 1877-1883. The map for June shows no cyclone originating in the Arabian Sea that year,” read the peer-reviewed research paper.Dr Parthasarathi Mukhopadhyay from IITM, one of the contributing authors, said, “After Columbia University professor Adam Sobel raised the query about the authenticity of the Great Bombay Cyclone, which found its way into various research papers, books etc. internationally, we decided to investigate the source. After extensive research, we found that the entire thing was a hoax.”However, former director general of IMD LS Rathore maintains the Great Bombay Cyclone did happen in 1882. “This is not a hoax. Owing to improper dissemination of information at the time, the true facts were never published or recorded. Even if they were, they have been lost through time.” Rathore said that the cyclone impacted the city’s port. “One would have to speak to a historian for more detailed description about the impact,” he said.City historian Deepak Rao said that geographically and demographically, contemporary Mumbai is much larger than Bombay of 1882. “Extension of Greater Mumbai, including the suburbs of Mumbai started from Mahim, which was added only in 1945. In 1882, the seven islands were not seen together as Greater Mumbai and the population would have been devastated completely if a cyclone had taken place,” he said.Dr Mukhopadhyay added that if over 1 lakh people had died in Bombay, the British administration would have documented this. “But we found nothing,” he said.Dr Mukhopadhyay said while Mumbai may never have witnessed a cyclone landfall (hit by a cyclone), the closest it came to was when Cyclone Phyan crossed the Konkan coast and the Mumbai region in November 2009. “The impact of cyclones in the Arabian Sea that may not make landfall near Mumbai have an increased impact on rainfall and wind speed over the years,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/was-there-a-cyclone-in-the-city-in-1882/story-6zfPfVHuFsrfzSoP3WJCtN.html
02-06-2020||Mumbai||‘First 2 weeks of June crucial for Mumbai’||The first 15 days of June, which will mark 11 days of relaxation of lockdown rules as part of the state’s Mission Begin Again, will prove to be crucial to determine the curve and peak of Covid-19 cases, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) analysis.The state on Sunday announced lifting of curbs with a three-phased plan, following 2.5 months of lockdown owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. The relaxations will come into effect from June 3, June 5 and June 8, and will allow plying of taxis, cabs, auto-rickshaws for essential use, and opening up of garages and workshops, restarting services such as plumbers and electricians and permitting outdoor activities such as cycling and jogging, barring containment zones.BMC has considered the 11-day period, as it is the approximate maximum incubation period for the virus before symptoms develop in any patient or the average maximum time taken for an asymptomatic positive patient to recover.The cases are expected to rise during this time. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of the public health department in BMC, said, “If an unidentified asymptomatic positive person takes public transport, which is possible during relaxation, he is likely to infect more people than he would while sitting at home during lockdown. So the number of cases in the first 11-12 days after the relaxations will help BMC estimate the surge – the extent to which the virus can spread without the lockdown. This needs to be studied.” “It is difficult to determine the exact time period of the peak for Covid-cases to Mumbai. But I believe we are nearing the peak now.”“This period will definitely give some clues about how the disease will spread after the lockdown is lifted,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer.During the lockdown, isolating the high-risk population is easier through contact-tracing, fever clinics and screening of random pool of citizens. “It helped in stopping Covid-19 suspects from socialising in the community and ensured timely medical help. However, post relaxations, the initial trend will help the government realise if the cases are stabilising, or the situation is getting worse. If figures go up during this time, we will have to scale up the resources further,” Kakani said.Kakani pointed out the government has two options. “No lockdown, so that more people interact, leading to a surge in cases. The numbers will stabilise and begin to reduce quickly, after the maximum number of people are affected. The second strategy is lockdown, where there are small jumps initially and a longer stabilising phase. BMC is prepared to handle the surge using the first strategy. This can also lead to herd immunity,” he said.Mumbai has been doing better than the earlier projections of BMC. Mumbai’s doubling rate has gone up to 16-17 days. The two worst-hit wards of G-South (Worli and Prabhadevi) and G-North (Dharavi, Dadar, and Mahim) are showing doubling rates of 25 or 26 days, according to Kakani. “Taking the multiplication factor of the virus into consideration, this is pretty good.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/first-2-weeks-of-june-crucial-for-mumbai/story-ACBdBaXVE4yVtegzZWrztO.html
02-06-2020||Mumbai||City crosses 40,000-case mark||The city crossed the 40,000-mark for Covid cases on Monday, with 1,413 new cases taking the tally to 41,099. The toll stood at 1,319, with 40 new deaths. Also, the G-North ward, which covers areas such as Dharavi, Dadar and Mahim, became the first of the 24 wards in the city to cross the 3,000-case mark with 79 new cases.The jump from 30,000 to 40,000 cases came within eight days and the city is expected to cross the case count of 50,000 next week, said civic officials. So far, 16,985 people have been discharged, putting the city’s recovery rate at 42%.Civic officials said while the cases are rising on a daily basis, the doubling rate, too, has improved. Suresh Kakani additional commissioner, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said, “We have managed to improve our doubling rate to 14 days, which was four-five days in the initial stages of the outbreak. A lot of positive cases are from among those in quarantine, which has helped contain the spread, as these people cannot come in contact with anyone in the community.”According to BMC’s ward-wise break-up of cases, as of June 1, while G-North ward topped the list, L ward (Kurla) was second with 2,668 cases. In F-South ward (Parel), the tally jumped from 2,572 on May 31 to 2,622. The sharpest spike was in N ward (Ghatkopar), from 1,804 cases on May 31 to 1,892 cases on June 1.In terms of ward-wise growth rate for a week, R-North ward (Dahisar) topped the list with 7.5%, followed by P-North ward (Malad) at 7% and S (Bhandup) ward at 6.8%. Wards such as E (Byculla), F-North (Matunga) and G- South (Worli and Prabhadevi) recorded lowest growth rate at 2.1%, 2.4% and 2.6%, respectively. Mumbai’s average growth rate stood at 3.85% on Monday, lower than Sunday’s 4.26% Meanwhile, Dharavi reported 34 cases on Monday, pushing its tally to 1,805. A total of 2.5 lakh from the area have been screened. The India’s largest slum cluster houses 8.50 lakh people.Dadar reported seven new cases, taking the total to 326. Mahim saw 17 new cases (total: 524).State health minister Rajesh Tope and additional municipal commissioner Sanjeev Jaiswal on Monday visited the Covid Care Centre in Dharavi, a 200-bed facility set up within 14 days.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, G-North ward, said, “This centre will exclusively have 200 beds with oxygen facility for moderate symptomatic patients. All medical and paramedical staff will start working in three shifts from Tuesday.”Civic body takes up sanitisation programme Along with upgrading a number of medical facilities for Covid-19 patients, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has taken up a sanitisation programme as per the guidelines issued by the government. The civic body is carrying out the work of sanitisation through three of its departments — insecticide, fire brigade and solid waste management (SWM) departments.Till date, a total of 7,764 government and semi-government buildings including BMC headquarters, municipal ward offices, private and civic hospitals, bus depots, markets, police station, railway station were sanitised. A total of 31,056 square kilometre area was sanitised by the fire brigade department while 97,306 square metre was sanitised by the insecticide department.The civic body has also taken up the work of sanitising public toilets. A total of 7,500 toilet blocks in 24 wards, where Covid positive patients were found, are being sanitised by the solid waste management department on a regular basis.The insecticide department of the civic body has also sanitised 1,08,240 houses of Covid positive patients along with the common areas and inside areas such as lifts.The civic body is using 17 quick response vehicles and 15 mist blower machines for the purpose of sanitisation of buildings and public places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-crosses-40-000-case-mark/story-YKpQUWWIMEllyAgFQFboiO.html
02-06-2020||Mumbai||Cop discharged without test, dies few hours later||A Mumbai Police head constable, who had tested positive for Covid-19, died on May 29, a day after he was discharged from the National Sports Club of India (NSCI) Covid care centre at Worli in Mumbai.The 53-year-old reported symptoms of cough and fever on May 16 and was admitted to the centre on May 18 after he was found to have been infected. He was discharged 10 days later on May 28 without being tested again as per the new guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).The new norms, which were issued on May 8, allow for patients with mild symptoms, very-mild symptoms and those who have been pre-symptomatic to be discharged without additional testing, 10 days after the onset of symptoms, and with no fever for three days. Also, patients with moderate symptoms can be discharged after 10 days of onset of symptoms if the symptoms resolve within three days and they maintain saturation above 95% for the next four days.In the case of the head constable, who was dropped off near his home by an ambulance on May 28 night, he experienced breathing issues a few hours after being discharged and his condition deteriorated. He was rushed to BYL Nair Hospital where he died before admission on May 29.Two days after his death, on Sunday, the constable’s 20-year-old son and 19-year-old daughter, too, tested positive for the virus. They have been admitted to SevenHills Hospital in Andheri.Dr Neeta Varti, in-charge of the NSCI facility, said, “The constable was admitted with a cough and fever. We followed the discharge process as per the ICMR guidelines and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) discharge policy, which states that a patient can be discharged after 10 days without a test.”Assistant municipal commissioner of G-South ward, Sharad Ughade, said, “It’s not in our hands. We follow the policy of the government.”BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal refused to comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cop-discharged-without-test-dies-few-hours-later/story-GFhtvDv8naNs6QkeLt94ZM.html
02-06-2020||Mumbai||Final-year exams cancelled: City colleges seek more clarity||A day after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced that all final-year students will be promoted based on their performance in previous semesters, colleges and students are confused. While some are unsure about how this will affect their future higher education plans, colleges too are unsure about how the decision will be applied in the coming weeks.“The government or university needs to clarify how this decision will affect students with backlog of papers from previous semesters which they need to clear in order to graduate. We are also unsure if the decision is applicable to post-graduate students as well,” said a senior professor from a south Mumbai college.Students of autonomous institutes, some of which already conducted exams for two or more papers of the final semester, are also in confusion about their situation. “How will the college grade us? We’ve already appeared for two papers for the current semester. With so many new decisions coming from the government regarding status of exams and promotion of students, we are confused about our status,” said a student.Students of Mithibai Autonomous College, Vile Parle, are also unsure about their status. Not only have students raised objection to the institute’s decision last year of introducing a new grading formula which many said lowered their scores in the previous semester, more than a hundred final-year students of the institute were also debarred by the administration for defaulting on attendance. “We had also taken this matter to court but the high court had upheld the institute’s decision. Since the Union and state government have made it clear that all students have to be promoted, regardless of attendance, we are still waiting to hear from the institute about our status. We haven’t got any help from the institute,” said a student of Mithibai Autonomous College. Principal Rajpal Hande was not available for comments.While clarity on aggregate marks in order to promote students is still unclear, many institutions are happy with the government’s decision to avoid exams and instead promote all students. “Many employers are requesting that students be relieved so that they can join the work force at the earliest. An exam for students in such large numbers is not possible anymore, so I’m glad the chief minister took the right call,” said Gopakumaran Thampi, principal of Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Bandra. He added that many students might opt for the exam session in October-November in case they don’t get grades as per their expectations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/final-year-exams-cancelled-city-colleges-seek-more-clarity/story-HkBK7JIXYDD2keaAUFH2UO.html
02-06-2020||City||Seed scam: Accused sent to two-day police remand||The owner of Brar Seeds, the store from where spurious paddy seeds were recovered during a raid, was sent to two-day police remand on Monday.Ludhiana police had sought the custody of the accused, identified as Harwinder Singh alias Kaka Brar, 56, to gather more information.His counsel, Bikram Singh Sidhu said, “My client has been implicated in the case. The seeds are genuine and were purchased from M/S Karnal Agri Seeds and Punjab Agricultural University (PAU). My client is innocent and we have full faith in the justice system.”Meanwhile, Richa Rani, Division Number 5 station house officer, who is a member of the special investigation team (SIT) formed by the commissioner of police (CP) Rakesh Agrawal, said all angles of the case are being looked into.Chief agriculture officer Narinder Singh Benipal said, “The store was selling seeds at inflated rates by branding these as high-yielding varieties of PR-128 and PR-129. The store owner’s licence has been cancelled. The seeds recovered from the store have also failed the germination test.”PAU had launched PR-128 and PR-129 seeds, both improved versions of 201 variety of PAU, in February. Agriculture department officials claim that the seeds fell into the hands of accused even before it was officially launched by PAU.“It is not possible to create the seeds of the newly launched variety within a month. The company needs at least a year to produce such a huge quality of seeds. So somewhere, either during the trial period or from some other source, the Truthfully Labelled (TL) seed landed in to the hands of the manufacturers who multiplied these seeds. However, we have sent the seed samples to PAU for gene testing,” said chief agricultural officer Benipal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/seed-scam-accused-sent-to-two-day-police-remand/story-zKLZsknbqP25nERajRzTxH.html
02-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh liquor baron gives names of ‘disgruntled associates’ to police day after firing at brother’s Sector-33 bungalow||A day after four to five men fired 17 shots at the house of liquor baron Arvind Singla’s brother in Sector 33, police have said it could be a case of business rivalry.The shots were fired from 9mm and .32 bore pistols at the bungalow of hotelier and businessman Rakesh Singla on Sunday evening.Though the police are yet to make any arrests, Arvind has given them names of four to five “disgruntled associates” who are now being questioned. It is suspected that the attack could be linked to the recent raids on illegal liquor factories in Punjab during the lockdown.Arvind Singla who owns around 500 liquor vends in Chandigarh and Punjab in his statement to the police said, “Four persons on Sunday evening had walked up to my private security guard asking to meet me, just a few minutes prior to the firing at Rakesh’s house.” The security cover provided to him by Punjab Police had been instructed to turn away anyone coming to his house. On Sunday, the security guard did exactly that, after which the accused walked to Rakesh’s house and fired 17 shots, police said.VEHICLE USED IN CRIME TRACEDAfter firing, the accused had fled in a car bearing a Punjab registration number. The police in a statement on Monday said the vehicle that was identified in the CCTV footage had been recovered from a village in Patiala. They added that the number of the vehicle was fake, and that the accused, too, had been caught on camera installed in the area.Teams had been dispatched to three different places in Punjab where the accused were likely to be traced to. Mobile dump data of the scene of crime is being obtained, they said.Chandigarh Police have said adequate security has been provided round the clock to the brothers in wake of the incident.As part of the Dhillon-Singla group, Arvind’s father Pawan Singla used to have a monopoly in liquor business in Punjab. But later the Singla group started operating separately. Arvind had even launched a beer brand recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-liquor-baron-gives-names-of-disgruntled-associates-to-police-day-after-firing-at-brother-s-sector-33-bungalow/story-f2we8CefGwEFf1uGeUVdUL.html

02-06-2020||Mumbai||State law making Marathi a must in all schools to be introduced this year||The state education department on Monday announced the implementation of the government’s rule of making Marathi a compulsory subject in schools across all education boards in Maharashtra. This academic year, the rule will be introduced for Classes one and six.In a government resolution(GR) on Monday, the department said that schools across the state, which are running different boards and offering various mediums of instructions, will have to teach Marathi as a compulsory subject starting from the academic year of 2020-21. “The rule will be implemented in phases. In the first year, it will be implemented for Classes 1 and 6. Every year, it will be extended further, in Classes 2 and 7 in 2021-22, Classes 3 and 8 in 2022-23 and likewise, until it is implemented unto Class 10,” read the GR.The mandate is a part of the Maharashtra Compulsory Teaching and Learning of Marathi Language in Schools Bill, 2020, which was passed in both the houses of the state legislature in the last budget session.Schools that follow boards other than the state boards — ICSE, CBSE, IB, among others — would have to adhere to the syllabus and teaching plan for the language as prescribed by the state education department from time to time.While most CBSE and ICSE schools have started their new academic year from April, some will begin their academic year in June. Currently, all learning across boards is happening online as schools have not reopened in the state yet. Like all other subjects, Marathi will also be taught remotely for now.Meanwhile, teachers said that it is a good step that the department has decided to implement the decision in a phase-wise manner.“Especially with the Covid-19 crisis, implementing a new decision like this is a challenge for schools because it means training teachers, making learning material available, etc. But it should not be too difficult as many schools already teach the language and those who don’t only have to introduce it for two classes this year,” said a teacher at an IGCSE school in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-law-making-marathi-a-must-in-all-schools-to-be-introduced-this-year/story-pRr3wIQFdMhdj9gPHrEU2O.html
02-06-2020||City||Now, Ludhiana residents can submit applications at suwidha kendras for getting TS1 certificate||With the municipal corporation (MC) having started public dealing in its offices from Monday, a new system has been started to get the TS1 certificate (no dues certificate) and for changing ownership of property to avoid rush of visitors at MC offices.A resident will have to submit an application along with the receipt of property tax and water-sewer user charges at suwidha kendras. If authorities find anomalies in the application or there are any pending dues, the applicant would be apprised of the same over phone.Officials said work at all the branches has not been initiated properly as many staff members were still deputed to transport migrant labourers to the railway station. The staff members, who remained in direct contact of the labourers, are also being tested for Covid-19 before they join duty. Meanwhile, a low footfall of people was witnessed at MC offices on Monday. MC secretary Neeraj Jain said the new system aimed at avoiding rush of visitors and maintain social distancing. “The residents will not have to visit offices for availing TS1 certificate and change of ownership service. People are also being provided hand sanitisers at the entry points of the offices and suwidha kendras.”REBATE ON PROPERTY TAXThe fund-starved MC has urged residents to avail 10% rebate on payment of property tax by June 30. No penalty and interest would be charged on payment of water-sewer charges by June 30. The payment of taxes can be made at suwidha kendras till 3pm and TS1 certificate can be had till 1.30 pm.FINANCE PANEL MEETING ON THURSDAYMayor Balkar Singh Sandhu said the meeting of the Finance and Contracts Committee (F&CC) of the MC would be held on Thursday (June 4) and emphasis would be given on approval of the resolutions pertaining to work orders for different development works pending for long. The mayor said that the meeting would be held in the park of his camp office to maintain social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/now-ludhiana-residents-can-submit-applications-at-suwidha-kendras-for-getting-ts1-certificate/story-DqZ7apofiwd4El8GBXFpXP.html
02-06-2020||Mumbai||Maha ready to ease curbs as tally passes 70K||Maharashtra on Monday reported 2,361 new coronavirus cases, taking its tally past 70,000 to 70,013, even as the state looks set to start easing lockdown restrictions. On the difference of three cases after adding the new cases to Sunday’s total, Dr Archana Patil, director, Directorate of Health Services, said, “Reconciliation of cases with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal is in process. That’s a reason there is a difference in the total cases.” State health officials are expecting the Covid-19 pandemic to reach its peak in the coming days as cases will surge in the post-lockdown scenario. The state is already experiencing a rise in infections in districts where there were no cases or comparatively fewer cases before curbs were relaxed from May 20.Of the total cases in state, 37,534 are active ones, accounting for 53.61% of the total, according to the state health department.On Monday, the state also reported 76 deaths, taking the toll to 2,362. Of them, 54 deaths are from the past two days, while the rest are between May 14 to 28, clarified the health department.Last Friday, the state had recorded 116 fatalities, its highest single-day figure so far. However, the government had clarified that 70 of them were from the previous 13 days. Meanwhile, Mumbai also breached the 40,000 case mark after 1,413 new cases were reported on Monday, taking its count to 41,099 cases. Of them, 22,789 are active cases. Of the 76 fatalities, 40 were in Mumbai, eight were in Pune, six each in Navi Mumbai and Mira-Bhayander, three in Vasai-Virar and Aurangabad , two each in Kalyan-Dombivli and Raigad, and one each in Thane, Nashik, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Jalna, Beed and Nagpur. The city’s toll stands at 1,319.Of the total deaths, 37 were of above 60 years of age, while 36 were in the age group of 40 to 59 years and the remaining three were below the age of 40 years. Of the deceased, 51 had high-risk co-morbidities, including diabetes, hypertension and heart ailments, health officials said.However, the rapidly rising graph of Maharashtra’s cases can pose a challenge; data shows that 84.72% of the state’s total 67,655 cases till Sunday, which is 57,323 cases, were reported in May — an average of 1,850 cases daily. Since the past 15 days, the state has recorded over 2,000 cases every day except on May 24, when it shot up to 3,041, which was the highest single-day spike at the time. In comparison, only 10,201 cases were registered in the state in April. To put the steep hike in further perspective, one should consider that the state’s first coronavirus case was reported on March 9 and it took 30 days for the figure to cross the 1,000 mark.State health Rajesh Tope on Monday said the recovery rate has improved by over three per centage points and so is the doubling rate of the cases. “The state government is trying to improve the situation. It is with effort that the recovery rate has improved by 3.5% points and is currently at 43.35%. The doubling rate has also increased to 17.5 days from 11 days,” he said.“We are trying our best to further improve the recovery rate and doubling rate of cases,” he added.Officials, however, believe there will be a surge in cases in the next few days and the pandemic will reach its peak as more people will be exposed to the virus, following the ease in restrictions. “Our concern is the rise in cases as more people will come out in red zones owing to the relaxations. It also means, more people will be exposed to the virus and hence, there will be more cases at the same time. This also could be the peak and that is the reason we have augmented the health facilities to deal with any situation,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity. The state has augmented the bed capacity to 25,000 in 2,576 hospitals, while the isolation bed capacity has been ramped up to 2.5 lakh beds.The state is already experiencing a rise in cases in districts where there were no cases or were minimal in number before fresh relaxations were given in the state on May 20. “We can take Gadchiroli as an example. Till May 18, the district didn’t have a single case, but after relaxations were given and migrant workers were also allowed to go back to their native villages, 35 people have been found infected with the coronavirus there so far,” he stated.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his live address on Sunday night, also indicated a rise in cases. He also said the lifting of curbs was being done very cautiously as the state was at a turning point. “We have either reached the peak of the curve or are about to reach. There will be a downward trend starting in the next eight-15 days,” Thackeray said.Last week, chief secretary Ajoy Mehta had clearly stated that the state expects cases to surge after lockdown curbs are lifted and are planning relaxations accordingly. “There will be a surge in cases after relaxations are given. We are planning to ease out the restrictions in phases and in a calibrated manner to avoid a sudden surge. The lifting of curbs will be announced in stages. Health infrastructure is being ramped up to ensure that cases can be handled effectively,” said Mehta.On Monday, the state also completed 70 days of lockdown, which was imposed from the midnight of March 23, a day before the nationwide lockdown imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was partially lifted on April 20 in the areas where there are no cases or minimal cases.On Sunday, the state has announced extending the lockdown to June 30, but at the same time extended more relaxations that will be applicable in three phases starting from June 3. From Wednesday, it is allowing outdoor activities like jogging, running and cycling and from June 8, private offices in red zones (excluding containment zones) will be allowed to operate.According to the state’s notification, physical activities, including walking, running, exercising, cycling, can begin from June 3 in sports complexes, stadia, playgrounds, beaches and open spaces. Shops, market places can be open (on odd-even basis) from June 5 and private offices (up to 10 per cent of staff) can start operating from June 8. These relaxations are applicable for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) [the areas governed by nine municipal corporations], Pune, Solapur, Aurangabad, Malegaon, Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Akola, Amravati and Nagpur — the 19 corporations that have been earmarked as red zones. All the containment zones within the red zones remain excluded from the relaxations.All markets, market areas and shops, except malls and market complexes, have now been allowed to open on a P1-P2 basis between 9am and 5pm. Shops on one lane will be allowed to open on odd dates, while another lane will be opened on even dates.The non-red zone areas, which include the remaining eight municipal corporations and rest of Maharashra, mostly covering the rural areas, have already been given greater relaxations.Thackeray said, “We are easing it out in a phased manner, so that we will not have to withdraw relaxations like how a few countries were forced to do so. In some countries, the lockdown curbs were reimposed because of the surge, while in some others, schools had to be shut down after they were opened.The health department declared to have conducted 4,71,573 tests at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra. Of them, 4,01,560 people tested negative, said an official.State currently has 3,294 active containment zones. A total of 18,674 survey teams, comprising doctors and assisting staff, have screened more than 70.69 lakh people.So far, 36,189 people have been kept in institutional quarantine in the state and over 5,67,552 people have been put under home quarantine.With the rise in fresh cases, the number of deaths has also started rising in the past few days. In the past 15 days, the state has recorded 1,164 deaths in the past 15 days, which is 49.28% of the total deaths recorded thus far.The mortality rate has also slightly increased to 3.38% (2,287 deaths on May 31) from 3.27% (1,792 deaths on May 26). It is also more than the national mortality rate, which is 2.83%, with 5,394 deaths till Sunday, stated the data from the state medical education department. However, the state has also succeeded in bringing down the mortality rate significantly from last month. On April 13, the mortality rate of the state was 7.41%. (148 deaths). This indicates improvement of 4.4%, the data shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-ready-to-ease-curbs-as-tally-passes-70k/story-8AD634ZJwd9Bg2fF97ztqO.html

He added that with the start of the airport, investments by NRIs, and other corporate houses would increase, that would generate thousands of employment avenues for the youth. Singh said they would also make efforts to ensure that the area also develops as a tourism hub, for which he would hold a meeting with the tourism department soon.The 161.2 acre land required for the construction of the civil terminal has already been acquired and Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) has taken possession of the said land. The MP said that they would try to get the construction of runway completed on priority, along with the terminal building, so that international flights can start operating soon.He said that in lieu of the acquired land, farmers have been paid a compensation of ₹20.6 lakh per acre. Besides this, each eligible family will be paid ₹5.5 lakh as rehabilitation and resettlement amount, he added.The Punjab government and Airport Authority of India had signed the agreement for a joint venture to set up the new civil and cargo international air terminal at the Aitiana village in Tehsil Raikot at IAF Station, Halwara, Ludhiana. The MP said the Punjab government is making efforts to ensure that the airport becomes operational in the next two and a half years.

02-06-2020||Mumbai||First pre-monsoon thundershowers of the year in Mumbai||The city woke up on Monday morning, day one of lockdown 5.0, to its first spell of the year’s pre-monsoon thundershowers, bringing some respite from the record May temperatures.The showers arrived eight days earlier than last year, when the city recorded its first spell on June 9. Light rain with lightning flashes and thunder were witnessed across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) from 4am onwards. Between 4.30am and 8.30am, the Mumbai suburbs recorded 0.2mm rain, 2mm was recorded in south Mumbai. The rain intensity reduced considerably post 7am in most parts of the city that witnessed drizzling. Traces of rain were recorded through the day in the city and suburbs. The minimum night temperature in the suburbs dropped from 29.2 degrees Celsius over the weekend to 26.8 degrees Celsius, and 24 degrees Celsius in south Mumbai, which reported 27 degrees Celsius during the weekend. The maximum temperature too, fell closer to the normal mark as the suburbs recorded 34 degrees Celsius, while 31 degrees Celsius was recorded in south Mumbai. Humidity levels were 98% in south Mumbai on Monday morning, which fell to 79% by the evening, while it was 82% and 66% during the day and evening in the suburbs. The weather bureau has predicted a cloudy sky with moderate rain or thundershowers for Tuesday morning, with the possibility of heavy rain by the evening. HT had reported on Sunday that the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted rain and thundershowers for Mumbai from June 1 onwards.“Pre-monsoon showers over the city are under the influence of the low-pressure weather system over Arabian Sea, which is moving steadily closer to the west coast and is likely to intensify into a (weather) depression soon. It has brought relief to Mumbaiites from the high humidity experienced over the past week,” said an IMD official. Under the influence of the prevailing weather systems in Arabian Sea, the Maharashtra coast, especially north Konkan, is very likely to experience an active wet spell between June 1 and 4, the official added.The IMD will be releasing information later on Monday on further intensification of the weather system and where it may make landfall between north Maharashtra and south Gujarat. The Maharashtra government on Sunday said it was prepared to deal with the tropical cyclone if it made landfall along the coastline. “A cyclone may land on our western coast in a couple of days. Though I feel this may not happen and the cyclone may change its direction, we are prepared. I am telling people from Sindhudurg to Mumbai, to be prepared. I urge our fishermen from going to the sea for four to five days,” said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his address to the state on Sunday.Meanwhile, if the weather system in Arabian Sea intensifies into a tropical cyclone, it will be the first cyclonic storm to make landfall along the Maharashtra coast during June since 1891. Only two weather depressions, one in 1948 and the other in 1980, came close to the coastline, but did not intensify into a cyclone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/first-pre-monsoon-thundershowers-of-the-year-in-mumbai/story-xr8ELp95wGisMD6wKUVnYI.html
02-06-2020||Chandigarh||From rediscovering classics to exploring non-fiction, Chandigarh warms up to book-reading during Covid lockdown||With more time at hand during the lockdown, both children and adults are turning to books to help pass time constructively.Along with the usual top-selling genres like fiction and thrillers, books about the economy and self-help are selling the most. Children have started rediscovering classic sagas like the Harry Potter series and the musings of Enid Blyton.Dev Pahuja, proprietor of Mohindras Book Shop in Sector 32, said that children’s books were starting to sell well again. “Even books on art are selling well. Art supplies and colouring books have surprisingly become one of our best-selling items as many children not interested in art previously are trying their hand at it,” he said.SELF-HELP BOOKS CATCHING PEOPLE’S FANCYAs per the proprietor of Sector-17 based English Book Shop, Rajiv Chaudhary, self-help is the genre catching people’s fancy most. “We are selling more self-help books now. Other genres like fiction and biography continue to remain popular, too.” However, the absence of tourists, who formed a large part of their clientele, was being felt during the lockdown, he added.Located on the other end of the Sector 17 market, business at the Capital Book Depot is also starting to pick up. Manager Anurag Gupta said, “People are asking for the latest books. Non-fiction is in demand and books on economics like Montek Singh Ahluwalia’s Backstage, which was published in February 2019, have become our bestsellers. People are starting to get more invested in learning about the economy during the Covid-19 crisis.”The Browser Library and Bookstore in Sector 8 has also opened its doors both for library members as well as book lovers. Chief executive officer Pankaj P Singh agreed that the interest in reading had gone up and inquiries kept pouring in: “Many of our loyal customers visited us as soon as we opened up our stores on May 4. Books for children of all ages are the current bestsellers.”Many people, however, were still cautious about coming to the store due to which they are developing a home-delivery system, Singh added.Meanwhile, schoolbooks and textbook sales continued to remain unaffected even during the lockdown. Vivek Manchanda of Manchanda Books and Stationery Store in Sector 19 said that parents had flocked the shop for the first few days after they had reopened, and even now textbooks were selling like hot cakes. “Since kids are confined to their homes, parents want them to utilise their time constructively and are, therefore, buying textbooks for them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/from-rediscovering-classics-to-exploring-non-fiction-chandigarh-warms-up-to-book-reading-during-covid-lockdown/story-TOVN4l75OidK8LrF5mCYeN.html
02-06-2020||Delhi||Our message to our officers is don’t fear the numbers, chase the case: Aaditya Thackeray||Amid the rising Covid-19 case count in Maharashtra and Mumbai, state minister Aaditya Thackeray explains the logic behind ‘Mission Begin Again’, health infrastructure and the steps the government is taking to contain the pandemic. Edited excerpts:Various states are emerging from the lockdown. Maharashtra is also facing the additional threat of a cyclone. How do you view the situation?We have been on top of the situation and fortunately people have been very cooperative and patient. No one in the world has been able to predict how long the Covid scenario will go on. We just started the mission ‘Begin Again’ yesterday as the lockdown has been in place for 2.5-3 months. But it has to be very, very slow, staggered and carefully planned. The important parameter here is the medical response, because it is life over livelihood. We went into lockdown in a measured manner starting March 8, and so the likewise has to be done while coming out of it.You have decided to open shops, but not malls? What was the thought process?There have been several deliberations – from observations from the WHO to what other countries are doing. For instance, is single-air circulation more detrimental than not having air-conditioning? Footfall was another factor to see how spacing out and social distancing could be implemented. From June 2 or 3, we’ve made it possible for people to at least step out and get into a little bit of physical exercise, but not go indoors [gyms], or touch surfaces. From June 5, shops on alternate sides of roads will open, and offices will open with 10% staff from the 8th. It is always going to be a trial-and-error method. It is a two-way process which needs cooperation of citizens. The slower we go the better.How does the government plan to open schools?June 10-13 is the time around which schools open. Most schools, especially in red zones, are quarantine facilities and we can’t open them right now. We’ve begun a process of speaking to people in the sector on how education can continue. Can we do it offline in green zones? What does social distancing mean? We are deliberating on it. The CM held an hour-long meeting yesterday on education and technology. We can’t let the academic year pass without education. Our school’s ratio is one teacher to 45 kids, so how do we do physical distancing there?The figures for the state look....Scary, yes. The principle we have to use as a government is not to fear the numbers, especially when you have a pandemic. In all cities such as New York and those in Brazil, the density of population is very different from Mumbai. One feature is Mumbai’s community toilets and the way our houses are planned and the number of people living in them…The chawls?Exactly. This is a vast difference from any other city…In comparison, we have done far better. There’s nobody to blame because the virus is an invisible enemy and there’s no point fighting it. High numbers don’t necessarily only mean more infection. They also mean the government has been more successful in identifying the carriers and isolating them. You will probably have a peak sooner rather than later. We have told all our officers on the ground to not fear the numbers, just chase the case. Why aren’t you testing asymptomatic people?We are going by the ICMR guidelines. World over, asymptomatic people don’t need any intervention. They can self-isolate. The guidelines say you have to test high-risk group between fifth and tenth day, and we are going by that. When you speak of hospital beds, we recall images from KEM hospital of patients lying amid dead bodies...We have said this before – there are a few things that have to be set in process once someone dies of Covid. You have to seal the body, wait for someone to claim it, but apart from that, we are also clearing a lot more space for the mortuary. The medical system is facing tremendous pressure across the world, as no one has seen so many patients in one place at one time. No matter what you do, you will have a shortage, as you have more people than the hospital or ICU beds. We’ve moved into creating more hospital and medical facilities. We had only 400 beds for isolation wards initially, but in the past 15 days, we’ve gone to 5,000. There has been some tension between Union and state ministers, say the exchange between CM Uddhav Thackeray and railway minister Piyush Goyal. Are you getting all help and cooperation from the Centre?I feel if you have two different parties or coalitions ruling the state and Centre, those tussles will always happen. Most importantly, there has been great cooperation within the parties in the state and with the Prime Minister, the Home Minister and the Chief Minister. They have been coordinating with each other. That, by far, has kept politics aside during this time. I don’t think this is the right time for any minister to speak about any politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/our-message-to-our-officers-is-don-t-fear-the-numbers-chase-the-case-aaditya-thackeray/story-etDt8YXx687P2noXmolvJK.html

02-06-2020||Mumbai||60 days later, 75% of Worli Koliwada is decontained||Sixty days since the first Covid-19 case was detected, Worli Koliwada, which became the city’s first containment zone, has been partially decontained and is now free of restrictions. Officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said only parts of Worli Koliwada where there are active cases, which account for 25% of the area, have been sealed.The area was declared a containment zone on March 29, after four cases were reported. It was also the first area in Mumbai where local transmission was reported as the reason behind the spread. Worli Koliwada comes under G-South ward, which covers Worli, Prabhadevi and Lower Parel. The ward has reported more than 2,008 cases, with 999 of the patients recovered.Shiv Sena MLA Aaditya Thackeray took to Twitter to thank residents: “Worli Koliwada where many patients were found and a containment zone was created, has now been decontained. Only places with active patients are sealed. Since this is the first containment zone, we encountered the problems we were experiencing for the first time. It became a model for fighting Covid-19. I thank the residents for their cooperation.”BMC has marked 12 clusters in Worli Koliwada and seven clusters in Janata Colony where the containment zone restrictions will stay. Sharad Ughade, assistant municipal commissioner of BMC’s G-South ward, said, “General lockdown conditions will stay and social distancing norms need to be followed. Containment clusters in Worli Koliwada and Janata Colony will have strict conditions. This was decided in a meeting between the police, BMC and community leaders.”A BMC official said, “Except the 19 clusters, the remaining parts will have to follow the restrictions and relaxations given by the state, Mumbai Police and BMC. Citizens will have to follow social distancing and stick to the opening hours of shops and offices.”The 12 clusters in Worli Koliwada cover Achanak Krida Mandal, Sonapur lane, Amar Prem Chowk, Tare House, Arun Prakas Sangh, Lawrence Kini House, Thomas Kini House, Omkar Niwas, Dominic Kini Chawl, Pakhaari Lane, Navjeevan Colony, Worli Fort and Sukur Master Chawl. In case of Janata Colony, the seven clusters include Saikrupa Seva Mandal, Amar Sandesh Sports Club, behind Building Number 42, Sagar Darshan, Sai Baba Mandir, Udar Krida Mandal and Golden Krida Mandal.According to BMC data, of the 717 containment zones in the city, Worli has eight, including Worli Koliwada-Janata Colony, Worli Police camp, Motilal Nehru Nagar, Mariama Nagar, Prem Nagar, Siddarth Nagar, VP Nagar and Worli BDD Chawl. Of the 3,336 sealed buildings across the city, 40 are in Worli.Meanwhile, in the first week of May, BMC had also allowed fishermen from Worli Koliwada to venture out into the sea for fishing, ahead of the onset of the monsoon. A maximum of five boats from each of the three jetties were to be allowed to be out at a time. However, there were not many takers as fishermen were not allowed to sell their catch in the market. They were asked to stock it and sell it later as dry fish.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/60-days-later-75-of-worli-koliwada-is-decontained/story-GToLEyxn7bVqGuxX6hswuK.html
02-06-2020||Mumbai||PIL seeks more Covid duties for corporators, HC seeks BMC’s reply||The Bombay high court has taken on record a list of suggestions by a petitioner in public interest litigation (PIL) and directed the BMC to respond to the same by Tuesday. The PIL was filed with the grievance that a private hospital had refused to admit a Covid-infected police constable as he was unable to deposit the huge amount demanded by the hospital and hence, there should be a cap on the charges.One of the suggestions seeks to assign more duties to the corporator of each ward in the city in the fight against the Covid-19 outbreak. The petitioner has contended that as corporators have not been assigned any specific duty or responsibility for his/her ward, and the ward officer is singlehandedly entrusted with the job of combating the outbreak. The involvement of the corporator would not only aid the ward officer, but also ensure that problems faced by Covid and non-Covid patients are addressed expeditiously.According to advocate Varsha Jagdale after the PIL was heard she was approached by many persons who wanted to join the petition, she however refused and asked them to share their inputs which they wished to be addressed through the PIL. She said that after receiving the same she made a list of suggestions and submitted them before the HC bench headed by chief justice Dipankar Datta. The bench accepted the suggestions and directed the BMC to respond to the same.The suggestions include providing PPE kits to all frontline workers as it has come to light that some health workers refuse to join duty fearing their safety. Another suggestion is to provide treatment on a priority basis to cops and health workers infected with Covid-19 infection and to permit all private clinics, small hospitals and nursing homes to start functioning.The suggestion to assign duties and responsibilities to corporators of each ward include monitoring and facilitating arrangements for Covid-19 patients and ensure implementation of government guidelines and norms in his/her respective ward. The corporator may also be assigned the responsibility to arrange for essentials services like groceries, medicines, etc in their respective wards and to provide information of Covid-19 hospitals and availability of beds therein through display boards in their wards.Jagdale said, the suggestions regarding corporators were made to relieve the burden on government and civic staff involved in the battle against the Covid outbreak and, if implemented, will go a long way in combating the spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pil-seeks-more-covid-duties-for-corporators-hc-seeks-bmc-s-reply/story-b2vZ4NI5WblSRk8WtZQMsJ.html
02-06-2020||City||Televised classes: 90% teachers found present during checking in Ludhiana||Deputy district education officer (elementary) Kuldeep Singh conducted a random checking through video calls on Monday to find out if primary school teachers were attending television lectures or not.Last month, the state education department had tied up with Doordarshan and DTH channels to telecast lectures for students of primary classes from 9am to 11am. Along with students, teachers were also asked to attend the lectures so that they could clear any queries that students had. The deputy DEO’s team called 10 teachers and found that only one of them was not attending the class. On enquiry, the teacher told the officials that she was unable to attend the class today as there was a power cut in her area.Singh said, “Our team will call teachers everyday to confirm if the topics covered that day have been taught to students. If teachers go through the lectures on television everyday, only then will they be able to resolve the issues faced by their students. We are receiving feedback from students that they enjoy attending online classes and many of them have sent pictures while attending classes too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/televised-classes-90-teachers-found-present-during-checking-in-ludhiana/story-fKaXschEdLsD6cWOkGSPiN.html

02-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi seals its borders, decision to be reviewed after a week||The Delhi government on Monday imposed stringent curbs on inter-state travel by deciding to seal the city’s borders for a week. While the move, according to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, is aimed at ensuring that hospital beds are not crowded by people coming from outside Delhi, it left many confused as to how they would go to work or board a train or flight. Addressing a digital press conference, Kejriwal sought suggestions from the public till Friday 5 pm on whether to keep the borders sealed beyond the stipulated one week. “For the time being, our government is sealing the borders of Delhi for one week. Essential services will remain functional and government officers can travel on their identity cards. Based on the suggestions received from you, we will talk to experts and decide on our future course of action on the opening of borders,” he said.A senior government official said that those who have been issued passes from the city administrations of Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram and Faridabad will be allowed as per the lockdown relaxation order.“Residents of Delhi who go for work to neighbouring cities will have to collect e-passes from their respective district magistrates. Since we have opened all private and government offices, it will be wrong to prevent employees from travelling to other cities. The passes can be taken from any neighbouring district as well. The idea is to restrict the unnecessary movement of people between NCR cities, an exercise that even the UP and Haryana administrations have undertaken,” said a senior government official. A media advisor to the chief minister said those coming from NCR cities and headed to the Indira Gandhi International Airport or any of the railway stations, the tickets would suffice as passes. “For the return of the driver to the NCR city, it is recommended that he is given a copy of the ticket. For ex-servicemen living in NCR cities and having medical appointments in their designated hospitals (army, Central government, railways, etc), their government ID card will suffice,” the spokesperson said.Delhi Police Commissioner SN Shrivastava said that the city police were yet to receive the Delhi government’s order regarding sealing of the city’s borders. “We are awaiting the DDMA guidelines on the Unlock-1. Once they are received, we will devise ways to implement the same. We will do what is best suited for the people of Delhi,” said the police commissioner.The chief minister further said the decision to open Delhi borders “can be challenging” because of the “large influx” of people from across the country for medical treatment in the Capital. He said it would lead to Covid beds getting filled in “just 2-3 days”. Kejriwal said Delhi would have 9,500 beds by Friday and currently 2,748 of the 4,456 beds are occupied. As per government’s plan, by June 15, it will have 10,000 beds ready for serious patients with 450 beds in the newly constructed Burari hospital and more private hospitals reserving their beds for Covid patients. On Monday, Delhi recorded 990 fresh cases taking the total to 20,834. The cases in the city also crossed the 20,000-mark, even as the number of active cases was 11,565 as on Monday. The Delhi government order sealing the city’s borders read: “In view of the current public health situation in the NCT of Delhi, inter-state movement of non-residents of Delhi, into the territory of Delhi shall be allowed only on the production of e-passes issued for essential services or in case of emergent circumstances, by authorities of respective state/UT and/or district magistrates of NCT of Delhi. However, government employees shall be allowed on the production of government ID card.” The order further stated that the movement of vehicles and individuals within Delhi is allowed and will not require any passes. Inter-state movement of good or cargo trucks will be allowed, it stated. The decision to seal the borders came a day after Haryana decided to lift similar restrictions on its side, assuring those travelling to and from Gurugram of a smooth commute after at least two weeks. The administrations in Noida and Ghaziabad, however, said that curbs on their borders will continue, notwithstanding the May 30 central order that eased restrictions on inter-state travel.Delhi residents who work in cities such as Gurugram and Noida were left puzzled if they will be allowed to travel to their offices or not. “Why did the government allow to open private offices if I had to restrict the movement of people. Now I will have to take an e-pass which will have a long pendency again. Last time, I got my pass after four days of application,” said Darshini Sinha, a resident of Vasant Kunj, D Block. The Delhi government’s decision was also criticised by the BJP and the Congress with the leader of the opposition in the Delhi Legislative Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, saying Kejriwal was trying to divert people’s attention from the failure of his government in handling the Corona crisis. “Delhi also has large central government hospitals like All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Ram Manohar Lohia and Safdarjung. How can Kejriwal decide that no patient from other states will come to these hospitals for the treatment. The chief minister is arguing that if borders remain open, there will be a danger of beds fixed for Corona patients being taken up by those from outside the city. But, the fact is that the increasing number of Covid patients has exposed the poor preparedness of the Kejriwal government,” he said. Delhi Congress chief Anil Chaudhary said when economic activities and vehicular movement has been restored in Delhi, there was no point in shutting off the city for neighbouring cities. “This will only create chaos on the borders. The government has not given any thought before making this announcement,” Chaudhary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-seals-its-borders-decision-to-be-reviewed-after-a-week/story-UiwdE0LGBEIkAFcILodq7I.html
02-06-2020||Gurugram||As Delhi shuts its borders with Gurugram, commuters face difficulties travelling||Just as the Haryana government decided to lift restrictions on the Gurugram border, the Delhi governments has shut it on its side. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who chaired a meeting in Chandigarh on Sunday evening, had said that the curbs should be eased even though the administration was yet to issue a written order.However, the Delhi government on Monday announced closing its borders with the neighbouring states to control the influx of Covid patients since thousands in other states depend on Delhi hospitals for treatment. The Gurugram administration has maintained restrictions on entry from Delhi side with varying degree of curbs for the past two months. The two conflicting orders on Monday evoked sharp reactions from the commuters and businessmen in the Millennium City. Nidhi Sharma, a South Delhi resident who travels to Gurugram daily for work, said the two orders have only added to the confusion. “I have been carrying my stuff in my car for the last one month. I had already shifted to Gurugram twice and returned after the relaxations were announced. This is sheer harassment,” she said.Another daily commuter, Gurugram resident Gaurav Gupta, expressed frustration over the confusion prevailing at the border connecting the two cities. “Its becoming very difficult to manage work and home with the current border situation. Every morning I leave for office thinking that what if I am not allowed to return what if cops ask me to stay back in Delhi. My family members are equally worried, “ he said.Muhammad Akil, commissioner of police, said on Monday that checking at all the 11 border crossings of the state that connect Gurugram with Delhi has been relaxed during the day. Intense checking is being carried out only during the rush hours. “We have not received any fresh orders regarding any changes at the borders. Our teams are deployed and have been directed to check the vehicles without movement passes. We are also allowing people without passes who are visiting the city for medical or personal reasons. But they need to establish their reason,” he said.There was not much congestion at the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway on Monday unlike last week, when the border was sealed again for a day. However, movement was restricted to three lanes on either side. The police personnel deployed at the border on Monday evening said that many commuters were stopping there to ask them about the situation at the Delhi border but they couldn’t help them with any information because of the lack of clarity.Several commuters who could enter Gurugram without any checks on Monday from Delhi said the governments may have taken such decisions in the wake of rising Covid cases, but for them it is a question of livelihood. Many of them have now resorted to find alternative routes. Thousands of industrial workers who stay in Delhi are now reaching their factories in Gururam through unpaved pathways in the Rajokri forest area, entering near Kapashera area and coming out near the Sirhaul border after jumping a small canal.Ram Dev, a worker of a spice factory in Udyog Vihar said that they started using the irregular paths to escape the police screening. “Coming through the main road was wastage of time as cops used to stop us and used to ask for passes, which were not provided by our employers,” he said.Shahja, a factory worker commuting from Kapashera to Udyog Vihar, said that the forest route is a short cut and more than 300 labourers travel together to reach their workplace. “Earlier we used to cross the border walking but now for the past 10 days, the police are not allowing us. So we have decided to cross the border via an irregular stretch, which is not manned by the police,” she said.The industry owners of Gurugram have also expressed surprise at the decision by the Delhi government. Shamsher Singh, a Udyog Vihar factory owner, said that how can the factories operate without labourers. There is no relaxation for the factories and, on the other hand, the labourers are facing issues in commuting. There is no transport facility for them and they have no other choice but to cycle or walk,” he said.The Union home ministry on Saturday had stated in its fresh guidelines that governments should allow free intrastate movement. However, the state governments are free to frame their own rules based on the Centre’s recommendations. Haryana government is yet to issue any formal guidelines for unlocking the city.Meanwhile a senior Delhi Police officer, requesting anonymity, said, “We are yet to receive a new notification from the Delhi government. The order will be implemented as and when we get it. Until then, existing border picket-checking will continue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/as-delhi-shuts-its-borders-with-gurugram-commuters-face-difficulties-travelling/story-sg9t3WcXkUIztcVNvEgIBP.html
02-06-2020||City||Unlock 1.0: P’kula goes beyond Centre’s guidelines to prevent Covid-19 surge||With the first phase of the country’s unlocking plan kicking in, Panchkula authorities are going beyond the central government’s guidelines to ensure that the number of cases in the district don’t surge.This includes mandatory testing of all those coming to the district from red zone states like Gujarat, Delhi and Mumbai, where the number of cases are high. The central government guidelines only advise 14-day self monitoring for such travellers.Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur says, “With the lockdown beginning to be eased and people coming from far off places, especially those returning from abroad, we are worried there is likely to be a surge in cases. Our first experience-- 27 of the 73 US deportees who reached here were found positive-- has shown this. So now, we are gearing up to deal with the influx.”She said that the plan is “quite streamlined”. “People are coming back through three modes-- air, rail and road. For international travellers, the system will be as per the central government’s guidelines – seven days’ facility quarantine and seven days’ home quarantine. As soon as they reach, they will be placed in four designated hotels in Panchkula, their sampling will be done and if they are negative after seven days, they will be sent for home quarantine of seven days.”For domestic travellers coming from red zones, the district will conduct mandatory testing even though the central government guidelines don’t recommend this. “For others, it will be 14-days self-health monitoring but they all will have to download an app developed by the Panchkula administration to help in tracking,” the civil surgeon said.Arrangements have also been made for extensive screening of passengers at Panchkula and Kalka railway stations. “We will conduct thermal scanning of every passenger exiting from the station and those with symptoms will be sent to the mobile medical unit stationed nearby. They will take a call on whether to put a person in isolation or not,” she said.Besides, the authorities will also be reaching out to the residents’ welfare associations to help keep tabs on those coming in their personal vehicles. “The idea is not to scare them, but rather to motivate and educate them to report promptly if they develop any symptoms,” she said.So far, with 26 positive cases and zero deaths, Panchkula has managed to fare much better than its neighbouring cities Chandigarh and Mohali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/unlock-1-0-p-kula-goes-beyond-centre-s-guidelines-to-prevent-covid-19-surge/story-dBEhwVXk8vBq9vW6rz1CKJ.html
02-06-2020||Delhi||Unlock 1: Malls, restaurants, religious places in Delhi to stay shut||In its order charting out guidelines for further relaxations during the ongoing nationwide lockdown, the Delhi government Monday said shopping malls, places of religious worship and restaurants would remain closed for now, even though the guidelines issued by the Centre on Saturday provides room for states to allow these to open from June 8.While senior officials in the Delhi government maintained that a review meeting is likely on June 7, following which a fresh order concerning malls, restaurants and places of religious worship may be issued, several prominent malls, restaurants and religious places in the city have their plans ready for resuming regular functioning after remaining shut or partially functioning for more than two months.“Shopping malls, restaurants and places of religious worship see large gatherings and they are places with a high risk of disease transmission. It is good that the government did not prioritise them in their relaxation strategy. But shopping malls and restaurants also employ thousands of people. One has to be very careful about policies concerning such enterprises and institutes considering the spike in Covid-19 cases that Delhi is currently witnessing,” Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, said.RELIGIOUS WORSHIPSeveral religious places have worked out their own rules to ensure social distancing on the premises if and when gatherings are allowed.Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid, said, “The government must have taken the decision after careful consultation with experts. We respect the decision.” Close to 10,000 people offer Friday prayers at the Jama Masjid in Old Delhi during summer and the number goes up to 22,000 in winter. But post-Covid, Bukhari said the numbers are going to be much fewer.Temples such as Jhandelwalan Mandir and Gauri Shankar temple in Chandni Chowk have worked out measures to control the crowd inside the complex. Jhandewalan temple authorities have decided to do away with the system of puja thalis and are doing a virtual aarti since the lockdown started. “We will continue with the online aarti even after the temple complex is allowed to open,” a member of the temple management committee said.At Sacred Heart Cathedral, Savarimuthu Shankar, the spokesperson of Delhi Catholic Archdiocese, said a plan for social distancing inside the church will be prepared only when the Delhi government gives the go-ahead.Manjinder Singh Sirsa, chairperson, Gurdwara Prabhandhak Committee, said, “We are hopeful that gurdwaras will be allowed to be opened from June 8. We are yet to receive guidelines regarding the opening from the government. However, we have made our own rules for when the gurdwaras are opened.”“We will increase the number of entry and exit points at gurdwara so that human interactions are kept to a minimum and to ensure crowd control. Hand sanitisers will be kept at a different points on the premises and central ACs will remain off. We are still unclear if devotees would be allowed to sit and pray,” Sirsa said.MALLS AND RESTAURANTSThe major city shopping malls too are ready to reopen with a long list of self-regulations from requesting shoppers to download the Aarogya Setu app, to full personal protective equipment (PPE) kits for staff and special demarcated spaces for visitors. “The shopping experience will be different from before, as safety and hygiene will be our top priority. Tweaks in design and markings will help visitors and retail outlets maintain the necessary social distancing of six feet, as per government norms. There will also be proper marking at counters and cash registers to stop crowding, fixing plexiglass shields at all checkout points are also being looked into,” a spokesperson of Select City Walk Mall, in south Delhi’s Saket, said.The spokesperson said the public areas will be sanitised every 60 minutes. An isolation room has also been identified in case a Covid-19 positive visitor is found. Besides, various retail outlets are formulating guidelines on trials and return/exchange of products. Also, parking will be restricted and will be kept to 50% of the total capacity.” Dinaz Madhukar, executive vice president, DLF, retail luxury and hospitality, said, “Masks, sanitizers, gloves, PPE kit and face shields will be stocked in every retail store. The number of visitors will be limited. We are also working on touch-less parking experience and encouraging digital payment. Valet service will not be available and there will be a strict protocol on the movement of cabs and personal drivers in the basement,” she said.Praveen Khandelwal, secretary-general, Confederation of All India Traders, said, “Covid-19 cases are increasing every day so it is advisable that malls not be opened as maintaining social distancing would be a tough task. Malls have a central AC system and the virus spread is more quicker in such environments. However, restaurants should be allowed to open from June 8 with all necessary guidelines.”Priyank Sukhija, member, National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), said, “So far, there is no clarity if restaurants with bars will be allowed to open or not. Also, if we are asked to shut by 9pm, it will not help all kinds of outlets. We are waiting for the association to come up with a set of guidelines based on which we will prepare for opening shop eventually.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/malls-restaurants-religious-places-to-stay-shut/story-6dEnJurU3qLou7HWQK9aOP.html
02-06-2020||Delhi||Unlock 1: Markets in Delhi to open fully from today||With markets in the national capital opening at full strength from Tuesday, market associations said they are yet to decide on a strategy that would facilitate full-scale operations while ensuring the safety of both shoppers and shopkeepers. This includes creating protocols for return and exchange of purchased items, trials of clothes, shoes, accessories, gadgets, electronic goods and utensils and all such activities where “touch” would be a necessity. Traders say the situation is tricky as they need to balance both sales and the safety of staff and customers.On Monday, the Delhi government announced Delhi-specific guidelines for the phased reopening of the city after the fourth phase of lockdown ended on May 31. Shops in markets were allowed to reopen from May 18 alternately open through the week, on an odd-even numbering system devised by the government. With store owners across markets opting different strategies to regulate entry of visitors and the “try and buy” system to minimise contact, customers are in for a different shopping experience. All shops are required to maintain social distancing and cannot have more than five persons inside a unit at a time.Most store owners across major markets including Connaught Place, Khan Market, South Extension, Chandni Chowk and Greater Kailash said they will urge customers to try on clothes only if it’s absolutely essential and avoid doing so if they are familiar with the sizes and fit of a particular brand.Others said they will experiment with sanitising products after each trial using a mild spray so that fabrics don’t get spoiled. Jewellery items can be tried and sanitised later, which is the case with bags and other such accessories.Also read: Unlock 1 - States differ on travel, quarantine protocolsTraders at the South Extension-1 and 2 markets, which have a large number stores selling apparel, jewellery, and accessories said they will hold a meeting with all shop owners to decide on a common protocol before relaunching full-scale operations. “So far, the footfall at the market has been too low. Now with markets allowed to open every day, we expect more customers to arrive. A common strategy has to be devised for all stores. We have already instructed all stores to hand over a pair of disposable gloves to customers upon entry. We are yet to take a decision on trials and exchanges,” Vijay Kheterpal, member, South Extension-1 market association, said.Store owners in Connaught Place and Khan Market said most of them are running franchises of various international brands, and they will wait for instructions from the brand head offices.Shopkeepers in markets such as Janpath and Sarojini Nagar, who mainly deal in accessories, footwear and clothing, said it will be tough for them to manage sales in this scenario, as items are on open display and are touched multiple times by customers. Most shops in these markets do not have trial rooms. “We plan to sanitise the items after it is touched by a customer. There was no trial policy earlier as well and now we will give a 10-day window to customers for exchanging/returning items,” Ashok Randhawa, president, Sarojini Nagar Mini Market Association, said. Traders in the Chandni Chowk market, who had voluntarily shut shop till May 31, said they were apprehensive that given the dingy lanes and crowding in Old Delhi, maintaining social distancing would be a huge challenge. The market houses all kinds of goods from clothes and daily use items to electronics.Besides, most of the electronic goods stores said that they were allowing customers to touch only select products. For instance, appliances such as television sets, and mixers and blenders, do not require the customer to touch it and a demonstration can be given by the staff wearing masks and gloves.“Many of our standalone stores are already open. We allow customers to handle only mobile phones and laptops where touch is a necessity for purchase. The gadgets are sanitised after each such use. For the rest of the products, the customers will not be allowed to handle them,” Ritesh Ghosal, chief marketing officer, Croma, an electronics appliances and gadgets retailing chain, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/markets-in-delhi-to-open-fully-from-tuesday/story-coFT6Scw4K6okP1TIbWTKP.html
02-06-2020||Delhi||Sadar Bazar traders want area to be desealed, write to CM Arvind Kejriwal||Traders in Sadar Bazar — one of Delhi’s largest wholesale market — have approached the Delhi government with a plea to de-contain their area so that they can resume business as usual. The market has been shut for almost two months since the entire area was declared a containment zone to prevent the spread of Covid-19. On Monday, the Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders Associations wrote to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal seeking permission to reopen their shops. The traders said they have been hit hard because of the continuing lockdown in their area and have now started living of their savings. The association in the letter to the CM demanded segregating the residential area from the commercial one so that shops could be reopened. Paramjeet Singh Pamma, a member of the association said, “Over 4,500 shops in Sadar Bazar have remained shut, as the whole area — including both commercial and residential — has been deemed as a containment zone. More than 70% of the area is purely commercial and has not seen any cases. It is different from the residential area, from where cases were being reported. We have suffered heavy losses and are finding it difficult to even run our houses now.” Nidhi Srivastava, district magistrate (Central district), said that the area is contained as per protocol. “Cases are still being reported from the area. The market falls in the containment zone, which has been sealed following orders of the Union home ministry,” she said. Meanwhile, Brajesh Goyal,convenor, AAP’s trade and industry wing, said, “We received their letter on Monday, which has been forwarded to the CM. A decision in the matter will be taken by appropriate authorities.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sadar-bazar-traders-want-area-to-be-desealed-write-to-cm/story-sUNaa1XXPqeeCfDWsFsYNL.html
02-06-2020||Delhi||‘Delhi Corona’ app to launch today||The ‘Delhi Corona’ app, created by the Delhi government, will be launched on Tuesday on Android and iOS. However, Android users started downloading the app on Monday itself.“You can check how many beds and ventilators are free, and in which hospitals, using an app now. We will launch the app tomorrow (Tuesday). If anyone in your family gets Covid-19, you will know where to go,” Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a press briefing on Monday.The app has been created for both Android and iOS. The app provides the number of beds available for the treatment of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients in government and private hospitals. According to government officials, the information is updated once a day.“The information will be updated on the app once every day,” a senior official from Delhi government confirmed. The app was last updated at 9am on Monday.On Monday morning, there were 6,670 beds for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in the city—2,116 in government hospitals and the rest in private, according to the app. Of these, 2,692 beds are currently occupied. Apart from these, there are a total of 302 beds with the ventilator facility available in the city—of this, 229 are in government hospitals and the rest in private hospitals. A total of 38 ventilators are occupied across the city, according to the app.By mid-June, the Delhi government plans to expand the number of beds up to 9,846. Of these 1,900 will be in three of its hospitals—1,500 beds in Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital in Dilshad Garden, 200 beds in Deep Chand Bandhu hospital in Ashok Vihar, and 200 beds in Satyawadi Raja Harishchandra Hospital in Narela.In addition to the information about the availability of beds, the app can be used to check all the containment zones declared by the government on Google Maps. Maps of all the Covid Testing Centres, Covid Care Centres, and Covid Health Centres are also available on the app. There is also a questionnaire to help people calculate their infection risk.A link to the government’s WhatsApp helpline is also provided in the app.Apart from that, the app also has daily updates on the number of cases recorded and the number of people tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-corona-app-to-launch-today/story-ONN6tA16yT6KduiwO0cfmN.html
02-06-2020||Delhi||Office-goers relieved as Delhi govt lifts restrictions on number of passengers in vehicles||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal lifted restrictions on the number of passengers in auto rickshaws, cabs and private cars, as the government moved towards “unlocking” the city on Monday. These relaxations come as a major relief to office-goers across the city who now have more options to commute to and from their workplaces. However, following the central government’s guidelines, the Delhi government has decided not to reopen the Delhi Metro services. “In light of the guidelines issued by the government, Metro services will remain closed for commuters until further notice. Our helpline services 155370 shall also not be available. You may reach us at helpline@dmrc.org,” read a Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) statement, following the government’s order on Monday.A senior Metro official, requesting anonymity, said that even though the DMRC is ready to restart operations while adhering to the norms of social distancing, they will abide by the government order. “This is a call that both the governments will have to take. If they ask us to restart services, we are in a position to do that on short notice too,” the official said. Meanwhile, commuters in the city heaved a sigh of relief at the government’s announcement on lifting passenger restrictions in auto-rickshaws, cabs, private cars, e-rickshaws and gramin sewas. Public buses will continue to operate with a passenger limit of 20 in each bus. However, with other modes of transport allowed to operate at full capacity, the load on public buses will probably be eased. “We were told that people from the same family wanting to travel in an auto-rickshaw were facing difficulties because of the one-passenger limit. Since the central government has not limited the number of passengers now, we are also removing these restrictions,” Kejriwal said, while lifting the restrictions.During the fourth round of the lockdown, the Delhi government had capped the passenger limit to one in auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws and cycle rickshaws. On two-wheelers, no pillion rider was allowed, and in private cars and cabs, only two passengers and the driver were allowed. Rajender Soni, the general secretary of Delhi Autorickshaw Sangh, said that the removal of the single passenger limit from auto-rickshaws has come as a breather to drivers. “There were barely any passengers, and we were forced to deny a ride to more than one person. Many drivers will benefit from this relaxation. Thousands of drivers were facing a major financial crisis during the lockdown,” Soni said.He also said that even though these relaxations have been issued, drivers are being instructed by unions to take all requisite precautions, such as wearing masks all the time, washing hands whenever possible and keeping a bottle of hand sanitiser in the vehicle, for their and the passengers’ safety. Cab aggregators such as Ola and Uber are also preparing a safety plan to normalise services. The Delhi government order did not specifically state if shared rides in cabs/taxis will be prohibited as was the case in the last four phases of the lockdown. A spokesperson of cab aggregator Ola said they will continue to restrict the number of passengers in their cabs to two and that they won’t restart shared rides in the Capital till there is clarity on the issue from the government. “Only two passengers per ride will be allowed in the cab. They will also be urged to sit by the windows in the rear of the car,” the company said.“All driver-partners have been asked to wear masks at all times. Before the start of each ride, they will have to upload a picture of themselves wearing their masks to authenticate the ride. They will also be provided with a hygiene kit with masks, sanitiser and disinfectants. Air conditioning will be switched off to avoid cross ventilation,” Ola cabs said in a statement on Monday. Many officer-goers said on Monday that travelling around the city had become tedious with the restrictions on transport. Tripti Yadav, who works in a private firm in Nehru Place, said she travels with a colleague, and because of the passenger limit in autos, they were being forced to take cabs to work, which was costing them a lot. “One or two days is fine, but if you have to take the cab everyday, then it starts to pinch your pocket. Even though the Metro is not operational, we will now be able to take the auto at a much lesser cost than the cabs,” Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/office-goers-relieved-as-delhi-govt-lifts-restrictions-on-number-of-passengers-in-vehicles/story-alWQO1gpxyGfO0nfNMkkxL.html

The man lived in Meethapur and was admitted to the hospital on May 20 for dialysis as he was being treated for kidney-related ailments there. He had tested positive for Covid-19 last week, the DCP said. “Around 4pm on Sunday, he hanged himself from the ceiling fan of his hospital room,” the DCP said. The police did not find a suicide note, but the DCP said that he suspected that the elderly man killed himself because of his ailments. Inquest proceedings are underway in the case, the officer said. This is the second known case of a Covid-19 patient killing themselves in the national Capital. Earlier last month, an army jawan had hanged himself from a tree at the Army Hospital after testing positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kidney-patient-who-tested-positive-for-covid-19-hangs-himself-at-hospital/story-UuajeuMq49YD7bomOhyb4N.html

02-06-2020||Pune||Pune district admin forms panel to address complaints against private hospitals||Pune The district administration, on Monday, constituted a health committee to address complaints of refusal of admission in private hospitals, or disputes over hospital fees.The committee, formed under district collector Naval Kishore Ram, will have powers to recommend action against private hospitals, as mentioned in the state government order issued on May 21, empowering the administration to take control of 80 beds across private hospitals in the city.Although currently there are various methods to register complaints with the district collector or Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), the committee will seek to ensure patients are protected during the coronavirus pandemic.Dr Ashok Nandapurkar, committee member, said, “The committee has been formed to not only look into complaints regarding Covid-19, but also non-Covid-19 patients. We have been asked to ensure that the recent state government order of cap prices on 80% of beds should be implemented properly. Also, we will look into any patient being asked to repeatedly shift from one hospital to another without any reason. In case discrepancies are found, we will take action accordingly.”Ram said, “We already have a system in place to address any complaints by patients, but in the wake of coronavirus we needed a dedicated committee for the same. This committee is not to harass private hospitals, but to seek better cooperation. Many private hospitals are doing a great job to ensure smooth treatment of patients and so we have not got many complaints in Pune. We will decide if we need a toll-free number or any other address mechanism on Tuesday and accordingly inform the public.”Dr Sunil Rao, group medical director, Sahyadri Hospital, said, “We had a meeting with the administration on Monday wherein we were informed about the committee. We have already admitted patients and are charging as per the new norms - 80% of the beds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panel-formed-to-address-complaints-against-private-hospitals-in-pune/story-A08s4IQ8HV8VWCgm7F9vuJ.html
02-06-2020||Pune||Under lockdown, Deccan Queen’s 91st birthday is a quiet celebration||The Deccan Queen, the iconic Pune-Mumbai intercity express train, for the first time since its maiden journey in 1930, failed to show up on the tracks of the Pune railway station to mark the anniversary of its existence on Monday, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.However, Harsha Shah, president, Railway Pravasi Group, ensured that the anniversary of the train was celebrated, sans its presence.“I tried asking the railway authorities to even get an empty coach of the Deccan Queen to the station for the celebration, but they did not agree. The train is stuck at the yard in Mumbai due to the lockdown,” said Shah.The train first ran the Pune-Mumbai route 91 years ago on June 1, 1930. Shah, herself, has been travelling on the train for the past 66 years.“I would accompany my father to the station and learned about the Deccan Queen when I was five years-old. It used to be a different colour when it started. The British who started the train called it the Blue Bird Baby. The Deccan Queen has never missed its anniversary until today (Monday). She maybe 182km away from me, but she is still in my mind,” said Shah.Shah conducted two celebrations - one at Laxmi road, Pune and one at the railway station with the railway authorities, including the station master officials.The train, known for its pantry car, is undergoing a facelift and will be painted a different colour. The train, which is instrumental in ferrying people in Pune and Mumbai working in either of the cities on daily basis, is not expected to be back on the tracks until June 30, said Shah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/deccan-queen-chugs-into-91st-year-of-its-reign-under-lockdown/story-qTD7D8McBv8LewYJFXEx1L.html

Besides the relaxations, Pune’s Cantonment is also likely to undergo changes.The city has seen 1,415 Covid-19-positive cases from outside the containment zones in the past few days.“A large number of cases have come from outside containment zones. The PMC has therefore reworked the containment zone map, which will be released tomorrow,” said Gaikwad.These 1,415 cases are mostly from adjoining areas of already demarcated containment zones.On the possible easing of curbs, Gaikwad said several delegations met him in the past few days. “We have given permission for the opening of Mandai and Tulshibaug. The plan is also to open the gardens in non-containment zones,” said Gaikwad.According to a senior PMC official, 150 public gardens will be opened for people to walk and exercise in, with a limited time frame.The government has deputed four IAS officers to oversee the containment strategy in Pune.On Rural Pune, which is also witnessing cases, district collector Naval Kishore Ram said relaxations will be as per the guidelines issued by state government on Sunday.Changes in 65 containment zonesIn the last 15 days, 1,450 Covid-19 positive patients have come from non-containment areas.Municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said, “A total of 1,450 Covid-19 positive cases have been found in non-containment zones in Pune. Considering the rate of new positive cases, definitely there would be a change in the existing containment zones. Some areas would get deleted and new areas would be added in. The containment zone areas will have only essential services operational. We are working on it and the orders for new containment zones would be issued on Tuesday.”Pune currently has 65 areas in the city marked out as containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/next-to-open-up-mandai-gardens-1-415-cases-from-non-containment-zones-prompt-new-containment-map/story-UiKe4xt7VFC7FQ1QeVPRFK.html

02-06-2020||Pune||Pune civic body to fill 97 medical posts to check Covid-19 spread||Pune Given the city’s current battle to contain the spread of Covid-19 (coronavirus), Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has initiated its long pending process to recruit doctors.The civic body on Sunday floated tenders to fill 97 posts for 13 cadres in the class 1 and class 2 category which includes neurosurgeon, cardiologist, medical superintendent (Kamla Nehru Hospital), assistant medical officer, paediatrician, radiologists, neonatologist, chest specialists, residential physician, physician, paediatric surgeon, intensivist and residential medical officer.Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal, who heads the health department, said that more such posts will be hired in a week’s time. “Draft Merit list declared on PMC website yesterday. 13 caders and 97 posts. It will help to strengthen PMC health dept. Thanks to hon DCM sir @AjitPawarSpeaks, who gave permission for recruitment. Rest posts draft list will publish in a week,” tweeted Agarwal.For the government-run Sassoon General Hospital too, the administration has decided to recruit doctors, besides upgrading infrastructure by adding more beds to intensive care units (ICU), and dialysis units, ventilators and other special cares.IAS officer S Chockalingam, who has been appointed as the nodal officer to look into the infrastructure needs of the hospital, said, “We will get 80 ICU beds and the unit will be ready by third week of June. Since Sassoon is a tertiary care centre, it is obvious that most patients who come here are referred for special care or require special care, but unfortunately some of them die. We will now also recruit specialists like intensivists and chest specialists to take care of critical patients.”Chockalingam said that more beds would mean more patients and more deaths with hospitals having a mortality rate of 2-3 per cent. Hence, the hospital has asked second year and third year students to attend to patients who are not critical.As of Sunday, the city had 173 critical patients out of which 42 were on ventilator and 131 were serious and in ICU. Although the government has capped the price on 80% of private hospital beds, the city would require special care for critical patients. The government has decided to take control of 80 per cent of private hospital beds. The hospitals will be allowed to charge their regular rates for the remaining 20 per cent beds. The capped charges are Rs 4,000 to Rs 9,000 for an ICU bed, including ventilator and isolation facility.In addition to adding equipment to the health infrastructure, the administration would also need specialist doctors to handle patients and equipment for which the civic body and Sassoon General hospital have floated tenders to hire specialist doctors, said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/spike-in-covid-19-cases-wakes-pmc-up-to-fill-97-medical-posts/story-ME7Zi7jag7nT8A1QVmNDbI.html

02-06-2020||Pune||Pune’s IISER, Sassoon to study loss of smell as key virus symptom||PUNE Loss of smell has been recently identified as one of the symptoms for Covid-19 (coronavirus) and to further study the symptom, Pune’s Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) and BJ Government Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital (SGH) are collaborating on a study to assess if early detection of olfactory dysfunctions can be used as a screening method for Covid-19 patients.A team headed by Dr Nixon Abraham and a team from Sassoon will circulate a questionnaire with a test for the sense of smell. The test will be simple and can be done by anybody with simple substances around them.Since it is a diagnostic method, the questionnaire will be shared among people who could be possible suspects and based on a harmless test of smell, the study would be concluded.Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Medical Education and Research, Maharashtra, which heads Sassoon, said, “Such a study is going on at many places, including Pune’s Sassoon and at Nagpur and Mumbai. However, it is too early to speak about it.” Deepak Mhaisekar, Pune divisional commissioner, said, “It is globally known that losing the sense of smell is one of the first symptoms in any Covid-19 patient. At least 80 per cent of confirmed patients are known to lose their sense of smell first and then taste.” IISER is also researching on various other projects related to Covid-19 which include to develop a synthetic biology-based solution and diagnostic test, to make an ultra-sensitive nano biosensor platform for field-effect, transistor-based point-of-care detection, synthesis of oligonucleotide probes for Covid-19 detection, to develop peptide-based diagnostics, exploring S-protein epitopes for the detection of Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19 and to develop fluorescence-based peptide diagnostics without secondary antibodies.The institute also hopes to develop a carbon nanotube (CNT)-based surveillance diagnostic tool for detecting the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19, which is in the planning phase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/smell-test-to-detect-covid-19-in-the-future/story-bba0VarfW68TtiaNqtM1kI.html

02-06-2020||Chandigarh||Doctor couple among 10 fresh cases, Ludhiana’s tally crosses 200||A doctor couple was among the 10 fresh Covid-19 cases detected in Ludhiana on Monday, taking the tally to 201.The couple-- man aged 34 and woman 29-- lives in Khanna town, and works at Mohan Dai Oswal Cancer Hospital.They are believed to have contracted the infection while treating an 80-year-old ex-serviceman from Miller Gunj, who had been admitted at the hospital’s cardiology ward, said civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga. The other doctors and paramedical staff who were treating the ex-serviceman have also been isolated. Besides, the health department has started contact tracing of the doctor couple.

02-06-2020||Delhi||As migrant workers return home, lack of workforce hits businesses in Delhi||With a large number of migrant workers returning to their hometowns amid the ongoing nationwide lockdown, a massive workforce shortage has hit the operations in industrial, transport and other sectors, which reopened after an almost two-month hiatus, according to various trade associations.Traders’ bodies estimate that nearly 60-70% of the labour force employed in Delhi left the city during the lockdown imposed to halt the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The Delhi government is likely to conduct a study on how many migrants have left the Capital and the impact of their exodus on different sectors.The workers who have returned to their hometowns are from both skilled and unskilled sectors and include those engaged as machine operators in factories, loaders, drivers, housekeeping staff, as well as those involved in packaging, construction workers, hand-embroidery workers, salespersons and security guards, among others.Business owners from the industrial, wholesale and retail, and transport sectors, and those who run small eateries and restaurants say that with a large chunk of workforce gone, the lockdown-hit business that was slowly picking up has been adversely affected.“Over 70% of the total workforce has already left the city. Local workers and those who come from neighbouring NCR towns such as Sonepat, Ghaziabad, Ballabhgarh, and Noida account for just about 20% of the total workforce. Of the local workforce, many are facing movement issues given the restrictions on state borders and only 8-10% of the workforce has been able to rejoin work in the last few weeks. As a result, compared to pre-lockdown days, only 5-7% of the usual business activity has taken place given that there is already very low demand and supply,” Praveen Khandelwal, general secretary, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), said.He added that the government must conduct a study on this mass reverse migration and come up with a consolidated policy to ensure social security and health cover for migrant workers in the future. “We have written to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs to look into the impact of the workers’ exodus on the economy and find ways to stabilise it,” he said. According to the data shared by the Delhi government, nearly three lakh migrant workers, who were stranded in the city after the nationwide lockdown came into force on March 25 rendering many jobless, have left Delhi in over 250 Shramik Special trains. According to government officials, at least 4.5 lakh people have requested the state government to send them back to their home towns and more trains are scheduled to leave Delhi in the next week. Delhi has not seen such a large-scale exodus of migrant workers in the last few decades. Soon after the lockdown was announced, a large number of migrant workers had started walking towards the city borders and the bus terminals to go back to their home states — mostly Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, West Bengal, and Odisha, among others. While several workers set out on foot, undertaking long, arduous journeys over several hundred kilometres, the Central and state governments later made arrangements to ferry workers home in the special trains.Due to the unprecedented manpower crunch, various factory units have also been hit. At Bawana industrial complex, around 6,000 factory units of the approximately 14,000 factories that are mostly involved in manufacturing plastic products, auto parts, and cardboard have resumed operations. “Earlier about 2 lakh people worked here. Now, there are only around 70,000 workers still around, which means that about 60% of workers have returned home. Our businesses have already been hit because of low demand, and not having enough people to work has just added to the challenge,” Rajeev Goyal, president, Bawana Manufacturers’ Industrial Welfare Association, said.Wholesale markets such as Khari Baoli and Naya Bazar where food grains and spices are sold are also feeling the heat of the migrants’ exodus. Naresh Gupta, president, Delhi Grain Merchants’ Association, said that even though shops in such markets deal in essential commodities and were open throughout the lockdown period, over 70% of the workers here left. “On average, of the 10 workers employed at one unit, only two or three workers are still here. From the supervising and management staff to those engaged in loading and unloading products, there are just a few workers. Now it takes us two to three days to clean, segregate and load stacks of grains, which used to be a day’s job earlier. We have also started receiving some interstate orders now, but with limited people, it has only added to the work pressure,” Gupta added.Daily operations at wholesale vegetable markets such as Azadpur Mandi have also suffered. Anil Malhotra, member, Agriculture Produce Market Committee, said most of the workers here left after some Covid-19 cases were reported at the mandi. “The workers were scared and left the city the first chance they got. Only about 35-40% of the workforce is left here now. Trucks stay lined up for hours as there are only a few men to unload the produce. This has added to the losses mounting already,” Malhotra said.According to the Delhi government, at least 25 cases have been reported from the mandi so far.Shop owners at retail markets are also trying to run their businesses smoothly even as many from the housekeeping staff, assisting salespersons, tailors, guards and even parking attendants have left town. “We will face a huge problem when more customers start pouring in. We haven’t been able to start proper parking arrangements at the market as there are no attendants, and hiring new people has also become difficult,” Ashwani Marwah, general secretary of traders’ association at Lajpat Nagar, said.Even the transport sector is not untouched. Pradeep Singhal, chairman, All India Transporters’ Welfare Association, said the transport business has suffered huge losses because of the labour shortage. “Since the initial lockdown, we have been working on 40% efficiency, and now with most labourers gone, we have come down to 30% efficiency. At times, when trucks with goods are ready to leave, there are no drivers available to transport them. The limited staff ends up doing multiple shifts often,” Singhal said.Brajesh Goyal, the convener of the traders and industries wing of the Aam Aadmi Party, confirmed that about 60%-70% of the total workforce has left the city. “The situation is becoming tough. Several migrants who remain in the city will also leave soon. We have been encouraging traders to ensure proper facilities for the available workers who are already demanding higher wages. The government is planning to set up a committee to address these issues.” A Delhi government spokesperson said the workers’ exodus will adversely impact the economy, and the government will soon conduct an assessment for the same. “The process of migration is continuing, and the lockdown has just been lifted. It will take a while to assess the impact on different sectors. The government will be undertaking a study in the matter eventually,” the spokesperson said. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/as-migrant-workers-return-home-lack-of-workforce-hits-businesses-in-delhi/story-5I90E2zIUOSiWkpvIQaq6M.html

02-06-2020||World||2 killed, 2 wounded in Kabul mosque bombing: Afghan official||A bomb exploded inside a mosque in the Afghan capital Kabul on Tuesday, killing two people, including the mosque’s prayer leader, and wounding two others an official said.Tariq Arian, spokesman for Afghanistan’s Interior Ministry, said the bomb targeted the Wazir Akber Khan Mosque at around 7:25 p.m., when worshippers had gathered for evening prayers. The mosque is located in a high-security diplomatic area near the offices of several international organizations and embassies.Mullah Mohammad Ayaz Niazi was one of two people killed in the attack, Arian said. He was wounded in the attack and died later at a hospital.Niazi was a well known cleric who was active as Friday prayer leader at the mosque. He was also a Kabul University professor in the Islamic Law department.Sediq Sediqqi, spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani tweeted that the government strongly condemned the attack, saying it “reveals the brutality and inhumanity of those who purposefully perpetrate violence against our Ulema and innocent people.”No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but the Islamic State group has been active in Kabul in recent weeks and has in the past carried out attacks inside mosques in Afghanistan.Taliban insurgents have never carried out an attack inside of a mosque.The IS claimed responsibility for the roadside bomb attack against a bus belonging to a local TV station in Kabul on Saturday, killing two employees of the station.Attacks against worshippers have increased in Afghanistan: Last month, an unknown number of attackers stormed a mosque in northern Parwan province, killed 11 worshipers and wounded several others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-killed-2-wounded-in-kabul-mosque-bombing-afghan-official/story-pB5pcSc8wDtvY8mEnyL1BL.html
02-06-2020||World||Five police officers shot, wounded in US protests||At least five U.S. police officers were shot and wounded during violent protests over the death of a black man in police custody, police and media said, hours after President Donald Trump vowed to deploy the military if unrest did not stop. Trump deepened outrage on Monday by posing at a church across from the White House clutching a Bible after law enforcement officers used teargas and rubber bullets to clear protesters.The U.S. Secret Service, charged with protecting the president, on Tuesday closed down until further notice the streets around the White House, media reports said. Demonstrators set fire to a strip mall in Los Angeles, looted stores in New York City and clashed with police in St Louis, Missouri, where four officers were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.An emotional St. Louis police commissioner, John Hayden, said about 200 protesters were looting and hurling fireworks and rocks at officers.“They had officers with gas poured on them. What is going on? How can this be? Mr Floyd was killed somewhere else and they are tearing up cities all across the country,” he told reporters.A police officer was shot during protests in Las Vegas, police there said in a statement. Another officer was “involved in a shooting” in the same area, the police said. Officers were injured in clashes elsewhere, including one who was in critical condition after being hit by a car in the Bronx, police said.Trump, a Republican, has condemned the killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American who died after a white policeman pinned his neck under a knee for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis on May 25, and has promised justice. But, with marches and rallies for racial equality and against police brutality having turned violent late each day in the last week, he said rightful protests could not be drowned out by an “angry mob.” “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,” Trump said.Floyd’s death has reignited simmering racial tensions in a politically divided country that has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with African Americans accounting for a disproportionately high number of cases. Democratic Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday urged patience, saying Americans could work through these tough issues. He pledged to take legal action if Trump carried out his military threat.“We can bring down the temperature, but not when the president ... is standing up calling for troops, and law and order, and domination,” he told MSNBC. “We will fight him, and we will take it to federal court.” Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser, in a separate MSNBC interview on Tuesday, said there were no signs of active duty U.S. military in the city overnight.CRITICISM OF CHURCH VISITAfter his address, Trump posed for pictures with his daughter, Ivanka, and U.S. Attorney General William Barr at St. John’s Episcopal Church near the White House.The presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church diocese in Washington D. C., Michael Curry, was among those who criticized Trump’s use of the historic church for a photo opportunity.“In so doing, he used a church building and the Holy Bible for partisan political purposes,” he said on Twitter. The church suffered minor fire damage during protests on Sunday night.On Tuesday, Trump was scheduled to visit the Saint John Paul II National Shrine in Washington.In New York, television images showed crowds smashing windows and looting luxury stores along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan before the city’s 11 p.m. curfew. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the curfew would be moved to 8 p.m. on Tuesday.In Hollywood, dozens of people were shown in television images looting a drug store. Windows were shattered at a nearby Starbucks and two restaurants. AUTOPSIESA second autopsy ordered by Floyd’s family and released on Monday found his death was homicide by “mechanical asphyxiation,” meaning physical force interfered with his oxygen supply. The report said three officers contributed to his death. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner later released autopsy findings that also called Floyd’s death homicide by asphyxiation. The county report said Floyd suffered cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by police and that he had arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease, fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use.Derek Chauvin, the 44-year-old Minneapolis police officer who planted his knee on Floyd’s neck, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

02-06-2020||World||6,500 Pak terrorists among foreign fighters in Afghanistan; LeT, JeM play key role: UN report||There are some 6,500 Pakistani nationals among foreign terrorists operating in Afghanistan and the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) play a key role in bringing foreign fighters into the war-torn country, according to a UN report.The report, from the UN Security Council’s analytical support and sanctions monitoring team and issued late last month, indicated Pakistani terrorists formed a significant part of foreign fighters that pose a serious threat to Afghanistan’s security because of their activities and permanent presence in the country.The report said the Afghan Taliban’s role as a credible counter-terrorism partner for the world community in the aftermath of the February agreement with the US will need careful monitoring because of the “number of foreign terrorist fighters in search of a purpose and livelihood in Afghanistan, including up to 6,500 Pakistanis”.Reacting to the report, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava expressed “serious concern” to the continued presence in Afghanistan of the senior leadership of al-Qaeda and a large number of foreign terrorists, including 6,500 Pakistan nationals. The report, he said, “vindicates India’s long-standing position that Pakistan remains the epicentre of international terrorism”.There have been reports since last year of the JeM and LeT, both blamed for high-profile attacks in India, sending hundreds of fighters to Afghanistan following increased pressure on Pakistan from the world community to crack down on terror groups.Also read: Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar’s kin linked to foiled J&K plotThe UN report said Afghan officials highlighted Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), JeM and LeT among the foreign groups posing a security threat. All three groups have a presence in the eastern Afghan provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar and Nuristan, “where they operate under the umbrella of the Afghan Taliban”, the report said.Afghan interlocutors said JeM and LeT “facilitate the trafficking of terrorist fighters into Afghanistan, who act as advisers, trainers and specialists in improvised explosive devices”.The report added: “Both groups are responsible for carrying out targeted assassinations against government officials and others. Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-i-Mohammed were stated to have approximately 800 and 200 armed fighters, respectively, co-located with Taliban forces in Mohmand Darah, Dur Baba and Sherzad Districts of Nangarhar Province.”Also read: Afghan reporter killed as govt says ready for Taliban dialogueIn Kunar province, LeT “retains a further 220 fighters” and JeM “has a further 30, all of whom are dispersed within Taliban forces”, according to the report.The TTP in Afghanistan is led by Noor Wali Mehsud and the group is thought to have about 500 fighters in Kunar and about 180 in Nangarhar.External affairs ministry spokesperson Srivastava said UN-designated entities such as LeT and JeM, “operating from Pakistan-controlled territories [were] facilitating trafficking and imparting training to other terrorists in Afghanistan”.He added, “This vindicates India’s long-standing position that Pakistan remains the epicentre of international terrorism. That proscribed terrorist entities and individuals continue to enjoy safe havens and recruit, train, arm, finance and operate with impunity from Pakistan with state support. They inflict violence and spread terrorism in the region and other parts of the world.”Pakistan, Srivastava said, has failed in fulfilling its international obligations, including under UN Security Council resolutions and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), to “put an end to support to terrorism emanating from territories under its control”. The world community should hold Pakistan accountable and seek sustained, verifiable and irreversible action against terrorism, he said.The UN report also highlighted the close and enduring links between the Afghan Taliban and al-Qaeda despite the signing of the agreement with the US in February. The agreement provided for the drawdown of American troops in exchange for counter-terrorism measures by the Afghan Taliban and intra-Afghan talks aimed at a permanent ceasefire.“Early indications are that many, if not all, of these objectives will prove challenging,” the report said.The report further said the Haqqani Network – a key component of the Afghan Taliban which Indian and Afghan officials have long contended has ties with Pakistan’s military establishment – continues to be close to al-Qaeda. It added that al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri met members of the Haqqani Network as recently as February.The report also highlighted the presence of Pakistani terrorists in the Islamic State’s Khorasan chapter, such as commander Abdullah Orakzai alias Aslam Farooqi, who was captured with 21 others in Kandahar in March. Twelve Pakistani nationals were captured along with Farooqi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-500-pak-terrorists-among-foreign-fighters-in-afghanistan-let-jem-play-key-role-un-report/story-76JHLj88PxYajUYtEgjTLN.html

02-06-2020||World||Russia backing antiviral drug Avifavir for Covid-19 fight good news for India, say scientists||Russia’s approval of the antiviral drug Avifavir to treat Covid-19 is good news for India as it is based on an influenza medication already in advanced clinical trials here, say scientists.Avifavir, described by its developers in Russia as perhaps the most promising anti Covid-19 drug in the world, is derived from Favipiravir.  Mumbai-based Glenmark Pharmaceuticals announced last week that Favipiravir is under phase 3 clinical trials -- the penultimate stage in drug testing -- in India.Stating that Avifavir has shown high efficacy in treating patients with coronavirus during clinical trials, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) on Monday said it will deliver 60,000 courses of the drug to Russian hospitals in June.It also said Avifavir has become the first Favipiravir-based drug in the world to be approved for the treatment of COVID-19, it said. The close derivative link between Avifavir and Favipiravir is reason for hope in India too, said scientists here. Favipiravir has anyway been in discussion and a point of interest in the recent past, said Arup Kumar Banerjee from the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital, Siliguri.He noted that Favipiravir is available under the name of Avigan for influenza and is often recommended for viral infections such as bunyavirus, filovirus and arenavirus.“It is  prescribed for severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), a viral hemorrhagic fever with high fatality rate and is effective against all strains of influenza viruses,” Banerjee told PTI. “Vaccine is important, so is antiviral. We need to develop both side by side. Today, if anybody comes up with a drug against COVID 19 irrespective of country or origin, it is a good news subject to validation of the same in large scale. Hence, the same applies to this derivative as well,” he added.Avifavir, developed by a joint venture between RDIF and ChemRar Group, is designed to disrupt the ability of the novel coronavirus to reproduce.“Avifavir is not only the first antiviral drug registered against coronavirus in Russia, but it is also perhaps the most promising anti Covid-19 drug in the world,” RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev said in a statement.The RDIF and the ChemRar Group last week announced that Avifavir has received a temporary registration certificate from the Russian Ministry of Health. “Avifavir is a drug that as per available information is being tested by Russia against COVID 19 and is based on Favipiravir, a drug that is known to have inhibitory function against RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity of a virus,” said virologist Upasana Ray.RdRP is an essential protein encoded in the genes of RNA-containing viruses.“Favipiravir has been shown earlier to inhibit the influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,” Ray, senior scientist at CSIR-IICB in Kolkata, told PTI.RNA polymerase is a viral enzyme that helps in replication or reproduction of the viral RNA, that is the genetic material. Hence, a drug that inhibits this activity would basically curb the functional multiplication of the virus, she explained.Glenmark last week announced a new randomised study in India to test the combined efficacy of Favipiravir and another antiviral drug Umifenovir as a potential COVID-19 treatment strategy.Glenmark also said that it is conducting Phase 3 clinical trials of Favipiravir as a COVID-19 therapy option with 150 patients, enrolled from nine leading government and private hospitals across the country.“So far, 30 patients have been randomised. The monotherapy phase 3 clinical trial results are expected by July or August 2020,” the company said in a statement last week.Glenmark said it is the first pharmaceutical company to receive approval from drug regulator Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) to conduct Favipiravir clinical trials against COVID-19 in India.Favipiravir is an oral antiviral drug approved in Japan in 2014 for the treatment of novel or re-emerging influenza virus infections. It has a unique mechanism of action by which it inhibits viral replication or reproduction, it said. “Since it (Favipiravir) was earlier tested for influenza, they (researchers) could bypass initial toxicity tests etc. It was one of (hundreds) of clinical trials against SARS-COV-2. With preliminary data for the clinical trials looking positive they jumped on it,” Durba Sengupta, from CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory in Pune, Maharashtra, told PTI. Sengupta said the drug acts on one of the main proteins that is responsible for RNA-replication.He also injected a note of caution.Till the clinical trial results are properly reported, it is difficult to say how effective it will be.“One has to be definitely cautious. First, it’s not designed to target this particular virus, and it is RdRP, so the binding may be weaker than in influenza,” Sengupta said. Though it is unknown how the different viral strains will bind, she said it is one of the better options right now.Another point, Sengupta noted, is that the drug’s action is on the same target as the antiviral remdesivir, one of the top possible drug contenders for COVID-19.“I think several people thought that remdesvir would be quite promising -- but it has been ambiguous so far. Getting robust clinical data in such short times is really tricky. It is really difficult to say without the actual clinical data and looking at the statistics,” she added.  India’s drug regulator has granted US pharma giant Gilead Sciences marketing authorisation for remdesivir for “restricted emergency use” on hospitalised COVID-19 patients in view of the crisis posed by the pandemic.The approval process for remdesivir was accelerated in view of the emergency situation and the unmet need for medicines in light of the coronavirus outbreak, a source in the know of the developments told PTI.

02-06-2020||World||Will stand by people of Hong Kong, UK tells China||The Boris Johnson government on Tuesday urged China to re-consider its new security law for Hong Kong, but if it failed to do so, the United Kingdom will offer pathways to full citizenship to holders of British National (Overseas) status in the former colony. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement in the House of Commons that “the UK will not just look the other way when it comes to the people of Hong Kong. We will stand by them, we will live up to our responsibilities”.There is cross-party consensus in the UK over official response to China’s new law, which is perceived as curtailing political and other freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong citizens under the Sino-British Joint Declaration signed before it was handed over to China in 1997.Raab’s announcement last week that the UK would offer pathways to citizenship to Hong Kong people prompted an angry response from Beijing, where it was seen as interference in the country’s internal affairs.Raab told MPs: “(We) are not seeking to intervene in China’s internal affairs. Only to hold China to its international commitments, just as China expects of the United Kingdom. We don’t seek to prevent China’s rise”.“Far from it, we welcome China as a leading member of the international community, and we look to engage with China on everything from trade to climate change. And it is precisely because we recognise China’s role in the world that we expect it to live up to the international obligations, and international responsibilities, that come with it”.Seven former foreign secretaries have urged the Johnson government to lead the international response to Beijing’s move. Soon after China’s National People’s Congress adopted the new law on May 28, four countries – UK, US, Australia and Canada – expressed ‘deep concern’.Raab reiterated the offer of citizenship to holders of BNO status, estimated to be nearly 2 million (about 3 lakh current holders of the passport and others eligible to acquire the status).He said: “The House will recall that BNO status was conferred on British Dependent Territories Citizens connected with Hong Kong as part of the package of arrangements that accompanied the Joint Declaration in 1984, in preparation for the handover of the territory”.“And under that status, currently, BNO passport holders are already entitled to UK consular assistance in third countries. And the British government also provides people with BNO passports visa-free entry into the UK for up to six months as visitors”.“If China follows through with its proposed legislation, we will put in place new arrangements to allow BNOs to come to the UK without the current 6 month limit, enabling them to live and apply to study and work for extendable periods of 12 months, thereby also providing a pathway to citizenship”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-stand-by-people-of-hong-kong-uk-tells-china/story-Y4OJnHy6OSYXPyqFcQ7wIO.html
02-06-2020||World||Covid-19 pandemic antibiotics surge will cause more deaths: WHO||Increased antibiotics use in combating the Covid-19 pandemic will strengthen bacterial resistance and ultimately lead to more deaths during the crisis and beyond, the World Health Organization said Monday.WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a “worrying number” of bacterial infections were becoming increasingly resistant to the medicines traditionally used to treat them.The UN health agency said it was concerned that the inappropriate use of antibiotics during the coronavirus crisis would further fuel the trend.“The Covid-19 pandemic has led to an increased use of antibiotics, which ultimately will lead to higher bacterial resistance rates that will impact the burden of disease and deaths during the pandemic and beyond,” Tedros told a virtual press conference from the WHO’s Geneva headquarters.The WHO said only a small proportion of Covid-19 patients needed antibiotics to treat subsequent bacterial infections.The organisation has issued guidance to medics not to provide antibiotic therapy or prophylaxis to patients with mild Covid-19, or to patients with moderate illness without a clinical suspicion of bacterial infection.Tedros said the guidelines said should help tackle antimicrobial resistance while saving lives.He called the threat of antimicrobial resistance “one of the most urgent challenges of our time”.“It’s clear that the world is losing its ability to use critically important antimicrobial medicines,” he said.Highlighting inappropriate usage, he said there was an “overuse” of antibiotics in some countries, while in low-income states, such life-saving medicines were unavailable, “leading to needless suffering and death”.- Disease treatment disrupted -Meanwhile the WHO said the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) had been severely disrupted since the Covid-19 pandemic began in December, following a survey of 155 countries.“This situation is of significant concern because people living with NCDs are at higher risk of severe Covid-19-related illness and death,” it said.The survey, during a three-week period in May, found that low-income countries were most affected.Some 53 percent of countries reported partially or completely disrupted services for hypertension treatment.The figure was 49 percent for diabetes treatment and related complications; 42 percent for cancer treatment, and 31 percent for cardiovascular emergencies. The most common reasons for discontinuing or reducing services were cancellations of planned treatments, a decrease in available public transport and a lack of staff because health workers had been reassigned to COVID-19 treatment.- Mass gatherings risk -The WHO warned about the dangers of mass gatherings, as protests rage in the United States and elsewhere over the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd, and as sports events begin a tentative resumption.“Mass gatherings have the potential to act as super-spreading events,” warned Tedros, highlighting WHO guidance designed to help organisers determine how such events can be held safely.The WHO was asked about the street protests in the United States and the fear that they could increase the spread of the virus.“With increasing social mixing and people coming together, particularly in areas if the virus is not under control, that close contact between people can pose a risk,” answered the organisation’s Covid-19 technical lead Maria Van Kerkhove -- stressing that she was speaking about mass gatherings in general.People planning mass events should undertake a “very serious, rigorous risk assessment”, she said.“Physical distancing remains a very important aspect to control and suppression of transmission of Covid-19. This is not over yet,” the expert said.- South America yet to peak -The novel coronavirus has infected at least 6.2 million people and killed more than 373,000 since the outbreak first emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP. WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said that infection rates in South America were “far from stable” following a rapid increase in cases.Brazil, Peru, Chile and Mexico were among the 10 reporting the highest new number of cases in the past 24 hours.“Central and South America in particular have very much become the intense zones for transmission of this virus,” Ryan said.“I don’t believe we have reached the peak in that transmission and, at this point, I cannot predict when we will.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-antibiotics-surge-will-cause-more-deaths-who/story-m7CWmU0Oc3mN1cR1ulVipK.html

The campaign will be difficult to replicate because of the massive mobilisation of resources required that includes deploying thousands of medics and setting up hundreds of temporary testing centres.Nearly 10 million tests could be completed in less than three weeks in Wuhan partly because medics also carried out batch testing of samples – maximum five samples at a time.If the batch result was positive, the individuals were separately tested.The cost for the tests was borne by the government.The total expenditure was around 900 million yuan or $126 million; an individual test cost 106 yuan or around $15.“The city had set up a maximum of 2907 sampling points in a single day, with more than 280,000 staff members and more than 50,000 medical staff participating in sampling and services,” Wang Weihua, deputy director of the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said at a press conference in Wuhan on Tuesday.Also on June 1, the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control collected random swab samples of tap water and domestic sewage, and from taxis, buses, subway cars and stations, shopping malls, restaurants and parks, said Li Lanjuan, a member of the high-level expert group of the National Health and Health Commission and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering:A total of “…2314 samples, the test results are negative,” Li said.Hu Yabo, Wuhan’s deputy mayor said the testing will bring “peace of mind” to the residents of the city, which is gradually returning to normalcy.“It (the testing) will definitely promote urban economic and social development on the right track as soon as possible. This investment is totally worth it,” Hu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-wraps-up-covid-19-tests-300-silent-spreaders-isolated-from-10-million/story-x3274Uaf9ULRhaHYmsD7RK.html
02-06-2020||World||George Floyd family autopsy could help accused policeman’s defence, legal experts say||An independent autopsy that found George Floyd died solely from asphyxiation could actually bolster the defence of the former Minneapolis police officer charged with killing him, legal experts said.The autopsy released on Monday said Floyd’s death, which sparked nationwide protests, was a homicide and that he had no underlying medical conditions.Later on Monday, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner released details of its autopsy findings that also said Floyd’s death was a homicide caused by asphyxiation but that he had possible underlying health conditions and intoxicants in his body that may have been contributing factors in his death..On the surface, the independent autopsy would seem to bolster the prosecution’s case against Derek Chauvin, the police officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck for several minutes before he died last week.But legal experts said it could do the opposite by creating confusion in the mind of the jury.“It will be part of the defence strategy to say they can’t even get the cause of death right,” said Gerald Lefcourt, a criminal defence attorney.The independent report was prepared for the Floyd family by Dr. Allecia Wilson of the University of Michigan and Dr. Michael Baden, who has worked on several high-profile murder cases.Graphic video footage showed Chauvin, who is white, pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, gasped for air and repeatedly groaned: “Please, I can’t breathe,” while bystanders shouted at police to let him up.Chauvin was charged on Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter. He has been fired from the Minneapolis police department.The video reignited an outpouring of rage that civil rights activists said has long simmered in cities across the country over persistent racial bias in the U.S. criminal justice system.Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is leading the prosecution, is not obligated to use the independent autopsy or introduce it as evidence at trial.Dan Alonso, a former chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, said the prosecution “wouldn’t be doing their job if they ignored it.”Former prosecutors and defence attorneys told Reuters that Chauvin faced a very difficult case given the strong video evidence.If prosecutors introduce the independent report, the defence could seize on the conflicting autopsies to create questions in the jury’s mind about the cause of death.Under U.S. law, prosecutors must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Introducing the report would also allow the defence team to cross-examine Baden and use his long history of work in celebrity trials to cast him as a hired gun, according to defence attorneys.“This report created a lot of ammunition for a defence team to use in a criminal case or a subsequent civil case,” said Paul Callan, a former New York prosecutor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/george-floyd-family-autopsy-could-help-accused-policeman-s-defense-legal-experts-say/story-qL9kKDbqQVJ9hcsppNnM2N.html
02-06-2020||World||China’s Wuhan tests nearly 10 million people for Covid-19, finds only 300 infections||China tested almost 10 million people for coronavirus in just over two weeks in Wuhan, the city where the pandemic began, officials said Tuesday, reporting only a few hundred positive cases.Chinese authorities claim to have largely brought the virus under control but Wuhan officials -- wary of a second wave -- launched the programme after new infections emerged for the first time since the city re-opened in April following more than two months in lockdown.More than 9.8 million people were tested in the city of 11 million people between May 14 and June 1, officials said at a press conference.Officials added that the 300 positive results were among asymptomatic patients.“These numbers show that Wuhan is now the safest city,” said Feng Zijian, deputy director of China’s national Center for Disease Control and Prevention.Residents queued up across the city at makeshift sites set up under tents in parking lots, parks and residential communities to give nucleic acid test samples -- with roughly half a million such medical checks conducted every day during the period.China does not include asymptomatic cases in its tally of confirmed infections.No asymptomatic people were found to have infected others, said Lu Zuxun, a public health expert from Wuhan’s Huazhong University of Science and Technology.The city found a handful of asymptomatic cases on most days of the testing campaign, which was initially described as a 10-day “decisive battle,” but reported zero asymptomatic cases for the first time on Monday.The virus first emerged in Wuhan late last year, but cases have dwindled dramatically from the peak in mid-February as China appears to have brought the outbreak largely under control.The official death toll in the country of 1.4 billion people stands at 4,634 -- most in Wuhan, and well below the number of fatalities in much smaller countries.However, doubt has been cast on the reliability of China’s numbers and the United States has led the charge in questioning how much information Beijing has shared with the international community.Wuhan’s testing blitz cost the city government around 900 million yuan ($127 million), vice mayor Hu Yabo said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-wuhan-tests-nearly-10-million-people-finds-only-300-infections/story-KTH1vvSGOnXT2pktwcQvmN.html

The Express Tribune reported that the meeting was informed that a tripartite agreement has been finalised among China’s Three Gorges Corporation, the authorities in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and the PPIB to implement the 1,124-megawatt Kohala hydroelectric power project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) framework.The project will be built on the Jhelum River and aims at annually providing more than five billion units of clean and low-cost electricity for consumers in Pakistan.The paper further reported that this marks one of the largest investments of USD 2.4 billion in an independent power producer (IPP) in the region.The 3,000-km-long CEPC is aimed at connecting China and Pakistan with rail, road, pipelines and optical cable fiber networks. It connects China’s Xinjiang province with Pakistan Gwadar port, providing access to China to the Arabian Sea.The CPEC passes through PoK, over which India has conveyed its protests to China. Last month, India protested to Pakistan awarding a mega contract to build a dam in Gilgit-Baltistan, saying carrying out of such projects in territories under Pakistan’s illegal occupation was not proper. The Pakistan government has signed a whopping Rs 442 billion contract with a joint venture of a Chinese state-run firm and a commercial arm of Pakistan’s powerful military for construction of the Diamer-Bhasha dam.“Our position is consistent and clear that entire territory of the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh have been, are and will continue to be integral and inalienable part of India,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in New Delhi last month.“We have consistently conveyed our protests and shared concerns with both Pakistan and China on all such projects in the Indian territories under Pakistan’s illegal occupation,” it said. Ayub, a grandson of former military ruler Ayub Khan, in his remarks, lauded the infrastructure board for playing a crucial role in optimising hydroelectric power generation.He said the government was determined to ensure long-term energy sustainability and reliability for which renewable energy, hydroelectric power and indigenous coal-based projects were being prioritised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-construct-1-124-megawatt-power-project-in-pok-under-cpec/story-0O0wIsdDYL42gguWiqOdeJ.html

This shocking tragedy clearly crossed that line.” pic.twitter.com/Wn7EoTInzUFloyd, an African-American man, died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck while Floyd was handcuffed and saying that he couldn’t breathe. His death sparked protests in Minneapolis and around the country, some of which became violent.Woods’ statement comes one day after former NBA star and current Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan made his first public remarks on Floyd and the killings of black people at the hands of police.“I see and feel everyone’s pain, outrage and frustration,” Jordan said in the statement posted on the Jordan brand’s social media accounts and the team’s Twitter account. “I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough.”Woods grew up in Southern California, and he said he learned from the Los Angeles riots in 1992 that “education is the best path forward.” Thousands in the city’s largely minority south side took to the streets after an all-white jury acquitted four white police officers of attacking Rodney King, a black driver, after a traffic stop.“We can make our points without burning the very neighbourhoods we live in,” Woods said. “I hope that through constructive, honest conversations we can build a safer, unified society.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiger-woods-speaks-out-for-first-time-since-george-floyd-s-death/story-e1hk5uSkYVB34pnIuqhg2K.html

Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg hosted a nearly hour-long video call with U.S. civil rights leaders to discuss ongoing issues around his company’s policies as they relate to race, elections and other topics. But participants were left disappointed, according to Color of Change President Rashad Robinson, who concluded that Zuckerberg can’t fully grasp the change they seek.In an interview with Bloomberg News immediately after the call, Robinson said that “the problem with my ongoing conversations with Mark, is that I feel like I spent a lot of time, and my colleagues spent a lot of time, explaining to him why these things are a problem, and I think he just very much lacks the ability to understand it.”These comments come at a time when the US is roiled by daily protests for racial justice triggered by the death of George Floyd, an African-American man, while in police custody in Minneapolis. Facebook has come in for criticism from within its own ranks, with an upswell of dismay among employees after the CEO adopted a hands-off approach to messages posted by President Donald Trump that seemed to threaten violence with the words “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”“His employees are outraged,” said Robinson. “I’ve got outreach from some of them. Saying Black Lives Matter, saying I’m going to give money, but having your policies actually hurt black people, people will know the difference.” Some of the company’s senior staff have taken to Twitter to make their discontent public.Facebook didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. In a statement sent to Axios, Facebook said it was “grateful that leaders in the civil rights community took the time to share candid, honest feedback.” The company added that “it is an important moment to listen, and we look forward to continuing these conversations.”Robinson also recently spoke up at a Facebook shareholder meeting and said he’s had dinner at Zuckerberg’s home and been on other calls with the CEO to talk about similar topics. Joining the Monday call was Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. All of this effort from Facebook’s executive team suggests the company is serious at least about bringing civil rights leaders on its side, however Robinson expressed more frustration than hope.“He continues to do things and make decisions that hurt communities and put people in harm’s way and is not accountable for it,” said Robinson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zuckerberg-leaves-racial-justice-leader-frustrated-after-call/story-W7sFwWuS10iGxPEXRCmJQJ.html
02-06-2020||World||Indian-American doctors outraged at Floyd’s death, racial discrimination in the US||An influential community of Indian-American doctors in the US has expressed outrage at the custodial killing of George Floyd and the “long history” of racial discrimination in America, saying that the “divisive rhetoric” seem to be getting worse each day in the country.African-American Floyd, 46, died after a white police officer kneeled on his neck as he gasped for breath till life left his body in Minneapolis on May 25. His death has triggered violent nationwide protests.Police have used tear gas to disperse the crowds and hundreds of people have been arrested as protests turned violent in some cities.The American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI), the largest body representing Indian-American doctors, in a statement on Monday condemned racial discrimination and violence against minority communities.“As American Physicians of Indian-origin, we are unanimously outraged by George Floyd’s death and the long history of racial discrimination that lives in this country. We are aware that these are difficult and distressing times for everyone,” said AAPI president Suresh Reddy.Reddy said that as physicians, they are dedicated to improving the health of everyone but they cannot fulfil this mission without directly confronting racism that is hurting the health of so many and contribute significantly to excess morbidity and death of the minority communities.Sudhakar Jonnalgadda, AAPI president-elect, said, “we are saddened by the divisive rhetoric and racial tensions that seem to be getting worse each day. We need to find solutions that ensure everyone in this nation receives fair and equal treatment and that police officers – who put their lives on the line every day to protect us all – are respected and supported.” AAPI endorsed the statement by American Medical Association (AMA), which described the “police violence as a striking reflection of our American legacy of racism— a system that assigns value and structures opportunity while unfairly advantaging some and disadvantaging others based on their skin colour and saps the strength of the whole society through the waste of human resources.” Sanku Rao, chair, AAPI Ethics and Grievance Committee, said that along with other leading health organisations, including American Medical Association, the Indian-American doctors denounce incidents of racism and violence that continue to ravage the communities.Standing in solidarity with peaceful protestors across the nation condemning the horrific death of George Floyd, AAPI secretary Ravi Kolli called out systemic racism and excessive violence by the nation’s police.“We call upon police departments across the country to, meaningfully address the twin problems of systemic racism and excessive, disproportionate use of force by officers in their ranks, working with local communities to end both, and hold accountable the police officers with misconduct and excessive force,” he said.Namratha R. Kandula, chair, AAPI’s Diversity and Equity Committee, said, “As immigrants to the US, our families may not always understand this history, but we join in solidarity with the minority communities and call for justice for George Floyd and for many others who have lost their lives to police brutality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-doctors-outraged-at-floyd-s-death-racial-discrimination-in-the-us/story-cWSkPZdgSweDdYpbnN5peP.html
02-06-2020||World||Iran scientist acquitted in US trade secrets case deported||An Iranian scientist imprisoned in the US and acquitted in a federal trade secrets case is on his way back to Iran after being deported, the country’s foreign minister said Tuesday.Sirous Asgari was in the air on a flight back to Iran, Mohammad Javad Zarif said in an Instagram post.“Congratulations to his wife and his esteemed family,” Zarif wrote.Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency later reported the news, citing Zarif.Asgari, a professor at Iran’s Sharif University of Technology, had been indicted in April 2016, accused by federal prosecutors of trying to steal secret research from Case Western Reserve University. The Cleveland school had been working on a project for the US Navy Office of Naval Research to create and produce anti-corrosive stainless steel.Asgari ultimately was acquitted in November after US District Judge James Gwin tossed out the case by the prosecutors.Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy Homeland Security secretary, earlier told The Associated Press that the DHS had started to try to deport Asgari on Dec. 12 following his acquittal. However, he said, Iran refused to recognize him as legitimately Iranian and provide him with a valid passport until late February.Once Asgari received the passport, DHS made several attempts to fly him back to Iran, purchasing tickets for flights on March 10, March 18, March 23, April 1 and May 1, according to Cuccinelli. Each of those flights was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, he said.Asgari’s supporters told The Guardian newspaper in April he had contracted the coronavirus while imprisoned. He had been held at Louisiana’s Winn Correctional Center by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement before his deportation, they said.Iran’s deputy education minister, Hossein Salar Amoli, recently said Asgari had recovered from the virus and would be able to travel, IRNA reported.Iranian officials had associated Asgari’s release with US prisoners held in Iran potentially being freed, something Cuccinelli strongly disputed. Iranian officials in recent days had been saying they believed Asgari soon would return to Iran.Among the US citizens held in Iran is US Navy veteran Michael White, of Imperial Beach, California. White was detained in July 2018 while visiting a girlfriend in Iran. He was convicted of insulting Iran’s supreme leader and posting private information online.He was released from prison in March on a medical furlough that required him to remain in the country in the care of the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, which represents America’s interests in Iran. White is among tens of thousands of prisoners granted medical furloughs by Iran, which was one of the first countries to be hit hard by the spread of the coronavirus.In December, Iran released a Princeton University scholar held for three years on widely disputed espionage charges in exchange for the release of a detained Iranian scientist.In March, the family of former FBI agent Robert Levinson, who vanished in Iran 13 years ago on an unauthorized CIA mission, said they had been informed by US officials that they had determined that Levinson was probably dead. They have not elaborated on how they made that determination.Westerners and Iranian dual nationals with ties to the West often find themselves tried and convicted in closed-door trials in Iran, only later to be used as bargaining chips in negotiations.The release comes as the US under President Donald Trump continues a maximum-pressure campaign targeting Iran after unilaterally withdrawing from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers in May 2018. In the time since, the two countries have seen a series of escalating incidents, including the US drone strike killing an Iranian general in Baghdad and an Iranian ballistic missile attack targeting American troops in Iraq.___Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-scientist-acquitted-in-us-trade-secrets-case-deported/story-cUPnFVCBQd4ZbSH8sJClbP.html
02-06-2020||World||Donald Trump visits historic church that was set on fire by protestors||US President Donald Trump has visited a historic church that was partially burned down in violent protests here over the custodial killing of African-American George Floyd, a day after he was forced to take shelter in a White House bunker. St. John’s church was set ablaze on Sunday night as protestors demanded justice for the killing of Floyd, a 46-year-old man who was pinned to the ground in Minneapolis last week by a white police officer who kneeled on his neck as he gasped for breath.His death triggered violent protests across the US. After the protests escalated on Sunday, the Secret Service rushed the president to an underground bunker previously used during terrorist attacks.On Monday, Trump stood in front of the boarded-up St John’s church with a Bible in his hand.“Greatest country in the world. And we’re going to keep it safe,” said the president who was accompanied by US Attorney General William Barr, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany.Trump announced his decision to walk down to the historic park during his address to the nation from the Rose Garden of the White House.“And now I’m going to pay my respects a very, very special place,” he said. Minutes later, he was seen walking out of the main entrance of the White House with secret service lined up on both sides.Known as “the Church of the Presidents”, St. John’s Episcopal Church held its first service on October 27, 1816, and the church was consecrated on December 27, 1816.The church is at a walking distance across the White House through the Lafayette Park, which has been a hub of violent protest in Washington DC for the past few days. Beginning with James Madison, until the present, every person who has held the office of President of the United States has attended a service at St. John’s, according to the information available on its website.“The protests that began peacefully grew to something more, and eventually a fire was lit in the nursery, in the basement of Ashburton House,” Rev. Rob Fisher, church rector, wrote in a blog post.Some reports said that small groups of people began setting fires and smashing windows once darkness fell. According to local police, a small fire was deliberately set in the basement.“It’s heart-rending. This is a very historic building. A person sprayed graffiti at the church: ‘The Devil is across (the) street’,” Fisher said.Earlier, the entire Lafayette Park was cleared of protestors. The protestors were forcefully removed from the park with police using tear gas.Since Sunday, Trump’s opponents and a section of the media have been slamming him for not being seen in the public.However, Trump’s family members, close aides and supporters hailed him for leading the country from the front.“This is the guy that the media and left just spent days telling us was a coward hiding in his basement,” said his son Donald J Trump Jr as he re-tweeted a video of his father walking down the Lafayette Park from the White House to the church.The president went to the church after an address to the nation from Rose Garden of the White House.“I will fight to protect you. I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,” Trump said, as he spelled out concrete steps to restore normalcy in the country which for the past seven days has experiences a spate of violent protests over the custodial killing of African-American George Floyd.“Powerful remarks by President”, said Kimberly Guilfoyle, advisor to Donald J Trump for President, Inc. and National Chair of the Trump Victory Finance Committees.“He truly is the President and leader for all Americans and he will stand up to defend both the peaceful protests, as well as the safety and security of our communities!” she said.Describing Trump as “the law and order president”, Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, said in a statement that Trump supports the rights of peaceful protestors, but anarchy, rioting and looting needs to end.“He has correctly called Antifa - a domestic terrorist entity. He is right in mobilising US military to end riots and lawlessness,” Mason said.Responding to questions, during her news conference, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said burning of the church was hurtful.“It’s hurtful, honestly. I think it’s hurtful on a number of levels,” she said. “That doesn’t honor the legacy of George Floyd. It doesn’t. And certainly not the burning of St. John’s Church,” she added.Considered to be the worst ever civil unrest in the US in decades, the violent protests have engulfed at least 140 cities across America in the days following the death of Floyd.Over 4,000 people have been arrested and curfews imposed in at least 40 cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-visits-historic-church-that-was-set-on-fire-by-protestors/story-3g9KUjtCdgeuIJPy2YVudM.html
02-06-2020||World||Explainer: Can you catch Covid-19 from delivered packages?||An outbreak of Covid-19 at a logistics centre run by one of South Korea’s largest online shopping companies has raised concerns over whether the virus can be transmitted by package deliveries.Who’s been infected?More than 117 cases of Covid-19 have been linked to the warehouse near Seoul owned by e-commerce giant Coupang facility. No cases have been related to deliveries and South Korean health officials have played down the chance of infection from packages.While infection from touching surfaces of boxes or bubble wraps couriered by an infected logistics centre worker would be concerning, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said transmission in this manner was unlikely.“There has been no precedent of a global transmission so far from delivered packages,” Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told a briefing.But health authorities and infectious disease experts have not ruled out the possibility of infection if a person touches their eyes, nose or mouth after contact with a contaminated package.Contaminated surfacesThe World Health Organization (WHO) has cited laboratory research that found the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 could persist for up to 24 hours on cardboard and 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel.Kim Woo-joo, a professor of Infectious Diseases at Korea University Guro Hospital, said the virus could also survive on surfaces like bubble wrap.“The virus can last up to 24 hours on cardboards and over three days on hard surfaces like stainless steel. There is no research on bubble wraps yet, but it could be between a cardboard and a stainless steel,” he said.Speedy delivery dangers?Many of South Korea’s e-commerce brands are known for their less-than-24-hour “bullet delivery”. Both Coupang and Market Kurly, which have reported infections from their logistics centres, provide fast grocery delivery services.This could raise the risk of spreading the virus, as packages don’t sit for long, some experts said.“We should take into account the temperature and the humidity of the package, but there is a possibility of infection as they pack it overnight,” said Shin Hyoung-shik, president of the Korean Society for Zoonoses, a leading expert in infectious diseases.However, Ki Mo-ran, professor of cancer control and population health at the National Cancer Center, said it was not so easy to contaminate packaging, and people should be safe as long as they wash their hands.“Just a small amount of virus is not that contagious ... the handles of a public restroom could be more dangerous.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-can-you-catch-covid-19-from-delivered-packages/story-Yg67EMuj9HTIBfMr1lG2CI.html
02-06-2020||World||First Rohingya refugee dies from coronavirus in Bangladesh||A 71-year-old man has become the first Rohingya living in vast refugee camps in Bangladesh to die from the coronavirus, an official said Tuesday.Health experts have long warned that the deadly virus could race through the vast network of settlements housing almost a million refugees in the country’s southeast.“He died on May 31. But last night we got the confirmation that he died of COVID-19,” said Toha Bhuiyan, a senior health official in the Cox’s Bazar district.The fatality was in Kutupalong, the largest of the camps, which is home to roughly 600,000 people.The man was among at least 29 Rohingya to have tested positive for the virus in the camps.Bhuiyan said the victim died in an isolation centre run by the medical charity Doctors Without Borders and was buried in the camp the same day. “We are going to speak to administrators in the camp and alert people about the death,” Bhuiyan said, adding they were trying to find people the deceased had been in contact with.Mahbubur Rahman, head of the health department in Cox’s Bazar district, told AFP officials were waiting for a full report on the death.A UN spokesperson said they would comment later.More than 740,000 Rohingya fled a brutal 2017 military crackdown in Myanmar to Cox’s Bazar, where around 200,000 refugees were already living.In early April authorities imposed a complete lockdown on the district -- home to 3.4 million people including the refugees -- after a number of infections were recorded.The first cases in the camps were detected in mid-May.Officials have since blocked roads leading to several areas of the camps where most of the infections have been recorded.Last week about 15,000 refugees were placed in quarantine as the number of cases increased. Bangladesh and UN authorities have prepared seven isolation centres with the capacity to treat more than 700 patients inside the camps.Aid workers say many of the refugees know very little about the virus.They blame this partly on local authorities cutting off access to the internet in September to combat what they said were drug traffickers and other criminals.Bangladesh has also seen a sharp rise in coronavirus infections in recent weeks, with more than 60,000 cases and around 700 deaths.Despite this the country lifted its coronavirus lockdown on Sunday, with millions heading back to work in densely populated cities and towns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-rohingya-refugee-dies-from-coronavirus-in-bangladesh/story-02Ak42RbOwmLzkMn0SiIZO.html
02-06-2020||World||Former US President Obama condemns violence at protests||Former US President Barack Obama on Monday condemned the use of violence at nationwide protests over racial inequities and excessive police force, while praising the actions of peaceful protesters seeking change. The vast majority of protesters have been peaceful, but a “small minority” were putting people at risk and harming the very communities the protests are intended to help, Obama wrote in an online essay posted on Medium. Obama, a Democrat who served two terms as president prior to Republican Donald Trump’s administration, said the violence was “compounding the destruction of neighborhoods that are often already short on services and investment and detracting from the larger cause.”The United States has been rocked by six straight nights of tumult over the death last week of a black man in Minneapolis, George Floyd, after a white police officer pinned him to the ground by kneeling on his neck.Obama’s latest remarks came three days after his first comments on the Floyd case, which called for justice but did not mention the violent nature of some protests. His shift in tone on Monday came as some protesters have set fires, smashed windows and looted stores, forcing mayors in large cities to impose nighttime curfews.On Sunday, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who served as Obama’s vice president and will face Trump in the Nov. 3 election, also called for an end to the violence. “Protesting such brutality is right and necessary,” Biden said in a statement. “But burning down communities and needless destruction is not.”Obama, who remains perhaps the most popular figure in the Democratic Party, endorsed Biden for president in April and has said he will campaign for him in the months ahead. Largely avoiding politics since he left office in 2017, Obama recently has been critical of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. As the first black US president, Obama dealt with civil unrest in cities such as Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, where there were widespread, sometimes violent, protests over the deaths of young black men at the hands of the police. In both cases, Obama was critical of the violence, saying they hindered efforts to curb police misconduct. In 2015, during the Baltimore protests, he blasted “the criminals and thugs who tore up the place.”Obama’s Justice Department launched probes into police departments in those cities and others such as Chicago in an effort to bring about internal reforms, a practice the Trump administration has employed much less frequently.In his Medium essay, Obama urged protesters not to be cynical about politics, arguing that electing new leaders on the national and local levels would bring about change. “Eventually, aspirations have to be translated into specific laws and institutional practices — and in a democracy, that only happens when we elect government officials who are responsive to our demands,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-us-president-obama-condemns-violence-at-protests/story-OLcWB3Wv62q7MKhXUtSvoM.html
02-06-2020||World||World’s latest billionaire emerges from costly divorce in Asia||A new female billionaire has emerged from one of Asia’s most-expensive breakups.Du Weimin, the chairman of Shenzhen Kangtai Biological Products Co., transferred 161.3 million shares of the vaccine maker to his ex-wife, Yuan Liping, according to a May 29 filing, immediately catapulting her into the ranks of the world’s richest.The stock was worth $3.2 billion as of Monday’s close.Yuan, 49 this year, owns the shares directly, but signed an agreement delegating the voting rights to her ex-husband, the filing shows. The Canadian citizen, who resides in Shenzhen, served as a director of Kangtai between May 2011 and August 2018. She’s now the vice general manager of subsidiary Beijing Minhai Biotechnology Co. Yuan holds a bachelor’s degree in economics from Beijing’s University of International Business and Economics.Kangtai shares have more than doubled in the past year and have continued their ascent since February, when the company announced a plan to develop a vaccine to fight the coronavirus. They slipped for a second day Tuesday following news of the divorce terms, losing 3.1% as of 9:43 a.m. in Hong Kong and bringing the company’s market value to $12.9 billion.Du’s net worth has now dropped to about $3.1 billion from $6.5 billion before the split, excluding his pledged shares.The 56-year-old was born into a farming family in China’s Jiangxi province. After studying chemistry in college, he began working in a clinic in 1987 and became a sales manager for a biotech company in 1995, according to the prospectus of Kangtai’s 2017 initial public offering. In 2009, Kangtai acquired Minhai, the company Du founded in 2004, and he became the chairman of the combined entity.China’s rapidly growing economy has been an engine for the country’s richest, and Du is not the only tycoon who’s had to pay a steep price for a divorce. In 2012, Wu Yajun, at one point the nation’s richest woman, transferred a stake worth about $2.3 billion to her ex-husband, Cai Kui, who co-founded developer Longfor Group Holdings Ltd. In 2016, tech billionaire Zhou Yahui gave $1.1 billion of shares in his online gaming company, Beijing Kunlun Tech Co., to ex-wife Li Qiong after a civil court settlement.Sometimes, a goodbye can be time-consuming too. South Korean tycoon Chey Tae-won’s wife filed a lawsuit in December asking for a 42.3% stake in SK Holdings Co. valued at $1.2 billion. That would make her the second-largest shareholder of the company should she win the case, which is still ongoing.The most expensive divorce in history is that of Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos. The Amazon.com Inc. founder gave 4% of the online retailer to Mackenzie, who now has a $48 billion fortune and is the world’s fourth-richest woman.(Updates Tuesday move in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-s-latest-billionaire-emerges-from-costly-divorce-in-asia/story-L2Ft9NrGWGBWoKNsTKZH6I.html
02-06-2020||World||Curfew imposed in NYC as protesters loot stores across Manhattan||The authorities in the upscale New York City have imposed a curfew and ramped up police presence after violence and looting incidents were reported across the city amid widespread protests triggered by the custodial killing of African-American George Floyd. Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio announced on Monday that the citywide curfew in New York City will begin at 11 PM on Monday and will be lifted at 5 AM Tuesday morning.They also announced that the New York City Police Department will double its presence, bringing nearly 8000 police personnel to help prevent violence and damage to property, in angry response to the killing of Floyd, a 46-year-old man who was pinned to the ground in Minneapolis last week by a white police officer who kneeled on his neck as he gasped for breath. The additional officers will be deployed in areas where violence broke out and property was damage during the previous night’s protests - specifically in lower Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn.Videos and photos posted on social media showed that while demonstrators protested peacefully around most areas in the city, there were several instances of looting as well.Also read: George Floyd died of ‘neck compression’, says medical examinerPeople were seen breaking into high end stores around Manhattan’s Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue, home to almost all luxury and high-end brands from around the world, and running way with merchandise from the shops. Groups of people also looted pharmacies, electronic stores and other businesses across the city.Governor Cuomo said that the curfew was imposed is to help separate the overwhelming majority of peaceful protesters from “people who are looking to exploit the moment by looting”. “New York City, they looted high end stores with high end merchandise. That wasn’t a coincidence. There were people who knew what they were doing. If you wanted to commit a crime…that was the time and night to do it, right?” he told CNN. Cuomo said while there are “extremist groups that just want to propose anarchy”, the majority of the people are making a very valid point that discrimination and abuse by police should finally end.The governor said in a statement that while the state authorities encourage people to protest peacefully and make their voices heard, the safety of the general public was paramount and cannot be compromised. “I stand behind the protestors and their message, but unfortunately there are people who are looking to distract and discredit this moment. The violence and the looting has been bad for the city, the state and this entire national movement, undermining and distracting from this righteous cause,” Cuomo said.He also criticised President Donald Trump for threatening to call in the military to end protests around the country.“What the president today did was he called out the American military against American citizens. That’s what they did. They used the American military to push back a peaceful protest, which everyone watched on TV, just so he could have a photo-op of walking to a church. When was the last time you saw the American military called out against Americans?,” he said. Trump, who was taken to an underground bunker in the White House on Friday as protesters gathered outside the presidential residence, on Monday ventured outside the White House grounds to pose for photographs at a nearby church. Before Trump came out of the White House, riot police and National Guard troops used tear gas and flash grenades to disperse a peaceful protest in a nearby park. Mayor Blasio said he supported peaceful protest in the city.The mayor said while demonstrations have been generally peaceful, “we can’t let violence undermine the message of this moment. It is too important and the message must be heard”. He said there had been incidents over the past few days, as the protests intensified, where police officers did not uphold the values of New York City or of the Police Department. “We agree on the need for swift action,” he said, adding that it will be ensured that such officers are held accountable. Considered to be the worst ever civil unrest in the US in decades, the violent protests have engulfed at least 140 cities across America in the days following the death of Floyd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/curfew-imposed-in-nyc-as-protesters-loot-stores-across-manhattan/story-XGKwDhlITtNbK1MFc4A4lL.html
02-06-2020||World||Louisville police chief fired over death of restaurant owner David McAtee||Riot police firing tear gas scattered a protest crowd from a downtown Louisville square Monday night, hours after the firing of the city’s police chief in the uproar over the early morning shooting death of a popular restaurant owner by security forces.David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue spot who was known for offering meals to police officers, died while police and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew early Monday amid waves of protests over a previous police shooting in Kentucky’s largest city. Police said they were responding to gunfire from a crowd.Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced the firing of Police Chief Steve Conrad at a news conference Monday. He said officers involved in the shooting failed to activate body cameras at the chaotic scene. Authorities had sought footage for their investigation, after Kentucky’s governor demanded the release of police video.“This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,” Fischer said. “Accordingly, I have relieved Steve Conrad of his duties as chief of Louisville Metro Police Department.”Gov. Andy Beshear later called the lack of body camera footage unacceptable.“This is the entire reason that we have those cameras,” the Democratic governor said at the state Capitol in Frankfort.Beshear authorized state police to independently investigate, promising the probe will be conducted in an “honest and transparent way that will not take months.”US Attorney Russell Coleman announced that federal authorities will be part of the investigation.The governor said he had counted on body camera footage to help determine “the truth in a way that spoke for itself, at a time when trust is difficult and people deserve to be able to see and evaluate.”Late Monday afternoon, a huge group stretching several city blocks marched peacefully from downtown Louisville to the spot where McAtee was shot. Some motorists honked horns and raised fists in solidarity.Hundreds of protesters regrouped later Monday night at downtown Jefferson Square and riot police standing shoulder to shoulder advanced amid burts of fired tear gas, dispersing the crowd. Military-style vehicles could later be seen occupying the emptied-out square.The shakeup at the top of the city’s police department came a month earlier than expected. Conrad had previously announced his resignation, which was to take effect at the end of June. Deputy Chief Robert Schroeder will step in immediately as chief, Fischer said.The mayor also said the city’s curfew was being extended until June 8.Police did retrieve video from crime center cameras that showed how the shooting unfolded, Schroeder said.Two Louisville officers and two Guard soldiers returned fire, he said. The two officers violated policy by not wearing or activating body cameras, Schroeder said, adding they have been placed on administrative leave.McAtee, whose YaYa’s BBQ Shack is near where the shooting occurred, was mourned by hundreds.Christopher 2X, an anti-violence activist and executive director of the group Game Changers, said McAtee was well-liked.“I’ve never known him to be aggressive in any kind of way,” he said.Schroeder agreed that McAtee was friendly to police officers. “Over the years he’s been a good friend to the police officers ... frequently making sure our officers had a good meal on their shifts,” he said.Before his dismissal, Conrad confirmed the shooting happened around 12:15 a.m. Monday outside a food market on West Broadway, where police and the National Guard had been called to break up a group of curfew violators.Someone fired a shot at law enforcement officials, and both soldiers and officers returned fire, he said. Several “persons of interest” were being interviewed, he said.News outlets showed video taken by someone in a car parked at a gas station. It recorded the sound of bullets being fired as groups of police and Guard soldiers crouched behind cars.Kris Smith said he was at a restaurant — “just outside having a good time, having drinks, eating barbecue” — when the soldiers arrived.“As soon as I walk to my car they jump out with the sticks, the police jump out with their sticks and their shields and stuff on,” Smith said. “It looked like something out of a movie. It looked like a freaking war zone.”He said he heard a loud noise, then gunfire minutes later.Smith, who is black, said the group had nothing to do with the protests.Protesters have been demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home.After Taylor’s death, the mayor said Louisville police would be required to wear body cameras.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/louisville-police-chief-fired-over-death-of-restaurant-owner-david-mcatee/story-MmEbjOr2mzhJtDwJwtVkOP.html
02-06-2020||World||UN Security Council elections to be held on June 17||Elections for five non-permanent members of the UN Security Council will be held on June 17, according to the world body’s provisional programme.The programme was released on Monday as France took over the Presidency of the 15-nation Council for the month of June. According to the informal provisional programme of work of the Security Council for this month, Security Council elections are scheduled for June 17. India is a candidate for a non-permanent seat from the Asia-Pacific category for the 2021-22 term. Its victory is given since it is the sole candidate vying for the lone seat from the grouping. New Delhi’s candidature was unanimously endorsed by the 55-member Asia-Pacific grouping, including China and Pakistan, in June last year.The General Assembly last week adopted a decision to hold the Security Council elections under new voting arrangements taking into account restrictions in place due to the Covid-19 pandemic. From India’s perspective, any change in how the voting is conducted will not impact much since it is the sole candidate from the Asia Pacific region and its term starts only in January 2021.The UNSC elections are held in the General Assembly hall with each of the 193 member states casting its vote in a secret ballot. However, large in-person meetings at the world body’s headquarters stand postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic till end of June. Under the new voting arrangement, President of the General Assembly Tijjani Muhammad-Bande will circulate a letter to all Member States at least 10 working days prior to the first round of secret balloting for the elections, informing them of the date on which the elections will be held, the number of vacant seats, the venue where ballots may be cast and other logistical details.On the day of the elections, the voter will be required to visit the designated venue during a specific time slot to cast its ballots. Only ballots cast in the ballot boxes at the designated venue will be accepted and no ballots would be accepted after the last time slot has expired.If the total number of ballot papers cast in all the ballot boxes do not amount to at least a majority of the members of the Assembly, the President would circulate a letter to all Member States indicating a new date and time for the elections. The General Assembly President will circulate a letter to all Member States informing them of the results once the voting is complete and the ballots counted. Canada, Ireland and Norway are vying for two seats in the Western Europe and Other countries category, Mexico is the only candidate for the one Latin America and Caribbean seat and Kenya and Djibouti will contest the seat available for the African group.Previously, India has been elected as a non-permanent member of the Council for the years 1950—1951, 1967—1968, 1972—1973, 1977—1978, 1984—1985, 1991—1992 and most recently in 2011—2012. India has been at the forefront of the years-long efforts to reform the Security Council saying it rightly deserves a place as a permanent member of the Council, which in its current form does not represent the geo-political realities of the 21st Century.Each year the General Assembly elects five non-permanent members (out of 10 in total) for a two-year term. The 10 non-permanent seats are distributed on a regional basis - five for African and Asian States; one for Eastern European States; two for the Latin American and Caribbean States; and two for Western European and other States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-security-council-elections-to-be-held-on-june-17/story-wUyB4LNbRVSDuD94skQiNM.html

WHO said it already had teams on the ground.Covid-19 already has touched seven of Congo’s 25 provinces, with more than 3,000 confirmed cases and 72 deaths. However, like many African countries Congo has conducted extremely limited testing, and observers fear the true toll may be far higher.“This quadruple threat could prove lethal for millions of children and their families,” said Anne-Marie Connor, national director in Congo for the aid organization World Vision.According to WHO, new outbreaks of Ebola are expected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo given the existence of the virus in an animal reservoir in many parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ebola-strikes-congo-again-who-says-covid-19-not-the-only-health-threat/story-DS3Ma0PWGDHAlOBSMMFz2N.html

At least one appeared to go under the vehicle’s wheels.The SUV drove around an armored vehicle and sped off as more gunfire sounded.The officers were taken to Erie County Medical Center. Authorities said their condition was stable.Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz tweeted shortly before 11 p.m. that the driver and passengers of the vehicle were believed to be in custody.Buffalo Police spokesman Michael DeGeorge said two people were struck by gunfire during Monday’s protest. It was not immediately known whether the shots came from police or others, he said. They were being treated at the same hospital.As a police helicopter flew overhead, officers in armored vehicles later fired tear gas to disperse the crowd within a few blocks of where the police were struck. Several stores in the area were broken into, and people were seen entering and leaving with goods.One woman on her front stoop said, “I’m scared,” to a person over phone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suv-hits-2-officers-at-floyd-protest-in-buffalo-speeds-off/story-qXvoPaT2MGjUVdfcXuAEKI.html
02-06-2020||World||Few Black CEOs from US are speaking out on killings, protests||Some of the country’s most prominent black corporate leaders are weighing in publicly on the protests gripping the US, drawing from their own personal histories as they call for unity and seek to reassure employees.The chief executive officers from companies including Tapestry Inc. and Merck & Co. are hardly the first prominent executives to comment on the topic. But by calling attention to their own backgrounds and relating painful experiences of discrimination, they are adding their voices to corporate America’s call for unity and calm.Jide Zeitlin, the CEO of Coach and Kate Spade owner Tapestry, wrote of his own personal experiences dating back to his early-20s in a posting on the LinkedIn website. He recalled flying to a racially divided South Africa after business school to advocate for disenfranchised black miners. Within a week of his arrival, he had his first contact with tear gas and rubber bullets. The lessons, he wrote, have lasted a lifetime.“We can replace our windows and handbags, but we cannot bring back George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Emmett Till, and too many others,” Zeitlin wrote. “Each of these black lives matter.”Merck & Co.’s Ken Frazier said in an interview on CNBC that the protests were sparked by public officials’ delayed response to the killing of George Floyd by police officers in Minneapolis on May 25.“What the African American community sees in that video tape, is that this African-American man, who could be me or any other African-American man, is being treated as less than human,” Frazier said, adding that it took four days for an arrest to be made.‘Inhumane Treatment’“What the community saw, was -- until they went out into the streets -- this officer, much less the other officers, was not going to be arrested for what was clearly inhumane treatment of a citizen,” he said.Lowe’s Cos. CEO Marvin Ellison wrote about growing up in the segregated South and the systemic oppression of the racial caste system his family was subjected to. He called for unity against racism and hate.“I have a personal understanding of the fear and frustration that many of you are feeling,” Ellison wrote in a post on Twitter. “To overcome the challenges that we all face, we must use our voices and demand that ignorance and racism must come to an end.”The small number of black voices weighing in from the top of U.S. companies draws attention to the reality that only about 1% of CEOs in the S&P 500 Index are black and progress has been mostly stalled for the last several years.In the S&P 500, African-American directors also made up only about 1% of board members, and 37% of boards didn’t have a single black member, according to an analysis last year by Black Enterprise magazine.Black voices also don’t appear to be gaining ground at the top of companies. Fewer than 10% of senior executives in so-called “profit and loss jobs,” or those that operate units, at the largest U.S. companies are black, according to an analysis late last year by executive recruiter Korn Ferry. The study was conducted for the Executive Leadership Council, which advocates for the promotion of African-American executives into the top executive ranks and boardrooms.“At some point the C-Level Suite is where you get to if you have certain experience and talents,” said Karen Boykin-Towns, vice chairman of the NAACP national board of directors and a senior counselor at public relations firm Sard Verbinnen & Co. “Not everyone can be CEO, for sure, but why is it that this crop of people, who consistently perform, aren’t given the opportunity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/few-black-ceos-from-us-are-speaking-out-on-killings-protests/story-MKubr93X99ilHqUqi4VljN.html
02-06-2020||World||China delayed releasing coronavirus info, frustrating WHO||Throughout January, the World Health Organization publicly praised China for what it called a speedy response to the new coronavirus and thanked the Chinese government for sharing the genetic map of the virus “immediately,.”But in fact, Chinese officials sat on releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the deadly virus for over a week after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, not sharing details key to designing tests, drugs and vaccines. Strict controls on information and competition within the Chinese public health system were largely to blame, The Associated Press has found from internal documents, emails and dozens of interviews.Health officials only released the genome after a Chinese lab published it ahead of authorities on a virology website on Jan 11. Even then, China stalled for at least two weeks more on giving WHO the details it needed, according to recordings of multiple internal meetings held by the UN health agency in January — all at a time when the outbreak arguably might have been dramatically slowed.Although WHO continued to publicly commend China, the recordings obtained by the AP show they were concerned China was not sharing enough information to assess the risk posed by the new virus, costing the world valuable time.“We’re currently at the stage where yes, they’re giving it to us 15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,” said WHO’s top official in China, Dr. Gauden Galea, referring to the state-owned China Central Television, in one meeting.The story behind the early response to the pandemic comes at a time when the UN health agency is under siege. US President Trump cut ties with WHO on Friday, after blasting the agency for allegedly colluding with China to hide the extent of the epidemic. Chinese President Xi Jinping said China has always provided information to WHO and the world “in a most timely fashion.”The new information does not support the narrative of either the US or China, but portrays an agency now stuck in the middle that was urgently trying to solicit more data. Although international law obliges countries to report information to WHO that could have an impact on public health, the UN agency has no enforcement powers. Instead, it must rely on the cooperation of member states.The AP has found rather than colluding with China, WHO was itself largely kept in the dark, as China gave it only the minimal information required. But the agency did attempt to portray China in the best light, most likely to coax the country into providing more outbreak details.WHO officials worried about how to press China for more information without angering authorities or jeopardizing Chinese scientists, whom they praised for decoding the genome with astonishing speed. Dr. Michael Ryan, WHO’s emergencies chief, said the best way to “protect China” was for WHO to do its own independent analysis, because otherwise the spread of the virus between people would be in question and “other countries will take action accordingly.”From the time the virus was first decoded on Jan. 2 to when WHO declared a global emergency on Jan. 30, the outbreak grew by a factor of 100 to 200 times, according to retrospective Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention data.WHO and officials named in this story declined to answer questions asked by the AP without audio or written transcripts of the recorded meetings, which the AP was unable to supply to protect its sources.“Our leadership and staff have worked night and day….to support and share information with all Member States equally, and engage in frank and forthright conversations with governments at all levels,” a WHO statement said.China’s National Health Commission and Ministry of Foreign Affairs had no comment. But in the past few months, China has repeatedly defended its actions, and many other countries — including the US — have responded to the virus with even longer delays of weeks and even months.In late December, doctors noticed mysterious clusters of patients with unusual pneumonia. Seeking answers, they sent samples to commercial labs. By Dec. 27, one company, Vision Medicals, had pieced together most of the genome of a new virus with striking similarities to SARS. They alerted Wuhan officials, who, days later, issued internal notices warning of the unusual pneumonia.On Dec. 30, Shi Zhengli, a renowned coronavirus expert at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, was alerted to the disease, and by Jan. 2, her team had fully decoded it.But when it came to sharing the genome with the world, things went awry. China’s top medical authority, the National Health Commission, issued a confidential notice forbidding labs from publishing about the virus without authorization. The order barred Shi’s lab from publishing the sequence or warning of the possible danger.Commission officials later said the order was to prevent any accidental release of the then-unknown pathogen, and to ensure consistent results by giving it to four state labs to identify at the same time.By Jan. 5, two other government labs sequenced the virus, and another lab in Shanghai led by Zhang Yongzhen had also decoded it. Zhang warned the National Health Commission the virus was “likely infectious.” The Chinese CDC raised its emergency level to the second highest, but did not have the authority to alert the public.Suspicious cases starting surfacing across the region. In Thailand, airport officials pulled aside a woman traveling from Wuhan with a runny nose, sore throat and high temperature. Scientists at Chulalongkorn University soon figured out she was infected with a new coronavirus, but did not have a sequence from China to match it.WHO officials, meanwhile, grumbled in internal meetings that China was stalling on providing crucial outbreak details even though it was technically meeting its obligations under international law. Ryan, WHO’s emergencies chief, said it was time to “shift gears” and push for more information.“The danger now is that despite our good intent...there will be a lot of finger-pointing at WHO if something does happen,” he said.On Jan. 11, Shanghai’s Zhang finally published the coronavirus sequence ahead of health authorities on virological.org, used by researchers to swap tips on pathogens. It was only then that the Chinese CDC, Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences raced to publish their sequences, doing so on Jan. 12.On Jan. 20, Chinese authorities warned the virus spread between people. WHO dispatched a small team to Wuhan from its Asia offices. China representative Galea told colleagues the Chinese were “talking openly and consistently about human-to-human transmission.”WHO’s emergency committee of independent experts met twice that week and decided against recommending an emergency. But the agency’s concern prompted an unusual trip to Beijing by WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and top scientists.At the end of Tedros’ trip, WHO convened another emergency meeting, finally declaring a global emergency on Jan. 30. Tedros thanked China profusely, declining to mention any of WHO’s earlier frustrations.“We should have actually expressed our respect and gratitude to China for what it’s doing,” he said. “It has already done incredible things to limit the transmission of the virus to other countries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-delayed-releasing-coronavirus-info-frustrating-who/story-iLlrOe2Ad876sikBmOzRmK.html
02-06-2020||World||Hong Kong’s leader decries US ‘double standards’ over protests||Hong Kong’s leader blasted the US for “double standards” in the way it handles protests after the Trump administration vocally supported sometimes-violent demonstrations in the Asian financial hub.“Look at how the local governments handle chaos in the US and what stance they took on a similar level of chaos in Hong Kong last year,” Chief Executive Carrie Lam said at a weekly news briefing Tuesday. “They are highly concerned about their national security, while holding different standards for our country, especially over Hong Kong’s situation.”Lam’s government is facing renewed anti-government protests as China’s plan to enact sweeping national security legislation over the city fuels public anger. President Donald Trump vowed to revoke some of the city’s special trading privileges and impose sanctions against Chinese and Hong Kong officials “directly or indirectly involved” in eroding the city’s autonomy.The US, which has passed bipartisan legislation backing Hong Kong’s pro-democracy camp, now finds itself engulfed by widespread unrest of its own, triggered by the death of African-American man George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis.Also read: Police fire rubber bullets, tear gas to disperse peaceful protest near White HouseLam’s backers in Beijing have seized the opportunity to needle the Trump administration over the protests in recent days, with Chinese propaganda outlets showing scenes from the US of burning buildings, harsh police responses and demonstrators decrying the government.China Trolls US Over Protests After Trump Criticized Hong KongLam on Tuesday addressed the possibility of US sanctions, saying there was “no justification whatsoever” for any foreign governments to level them on Hong Kong.“For the time being, I have not seen or heard any details from the US administration,” she said. “My stance is to point out to the American government, and any other governments if that arises, is that they will be hurting their own interests in Hong Kong,” she added.Vigil BannedEarlier this week, Hong Kong’s police for the first time banned people from gathering June 4 to commemorate the 1989 crackdown on activists in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, a day that has typically been a flashpoint for protests. In anticipation of the order, the organizer said Sunday that it planned to conduct the event online.June 4 coincides with the final day that the Hong Kong government is enforcing social-distancing rules -- unless there are any extensions -- that bar gatherings of more than eight people. Officials have denied that the Tiananmen vigil had anything to do with the timing of the rules.Lam said Hong Kong was cautious about further relaxing coronavirus-related social distancing measures after the discovery of a cluster of new virus cases spread within the community, and that it would make announcements on the issue as soon as possible, without giving further details. The city has seen relative success in containing the spread of the pandemic, and has slowly returned to a sense of normalcy in recent weeks.But as parts of the world begin reopening after virus-induced closures, Lam cautioned that governments shouldn’t take measures that would further undermine the global economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-leader-decries-us-double-standards-over-protests/story-V7Nqq1XzYf9moTrA0UnMbO.html
02-06-2020||World||CNG price in Delhi hiked by Re 1 per kg||CNG price in the national capital and adjoining cities on Monday was hiked by Re 1 per kg to make up for the additional cost incurred to keep stations coronavirus ready. Indraprastha Gas Ltd (IGL), the firm that retails CNG to automobiles and piped natural gas to household kitchens, revised CNG price in the national capital “from Rs 42/ kg to Rs 43/ kg, w.e.f. 6 am on 2nd June 2020,” the firm tweeted. There will, however, be no change in piped cooking gas prices. The company had last cut CNG price by Rs 3.2 per kg and piped natural gas rate by Rs 1.55 per unit from April 3. The nationwide lockdown imposed from March 25 saw fuel sales drop by as much as 90 per cent but relaxations thereafter have not helped demand recover to pre-COVID levels. Despite the drop in sales, the company continued to incur expenditure on paying salaries, fixed charges for power connections, maintenance of equipment and rent, sources said. To recover these charges, the firm has raised CNG prices, they said. “CNG retail price in Noida, Greater Noida & Ghaziabad being revised from Rs 47.75/ kg to Rs 48.75/ kg, w.e.f. 6 am on 2nd June 2020,” IGL said in another tweet.

02-06-2020||World||Police fire rubber bullets, tear gas to disperse peaceful protest near White House||Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday as U.S. President Donald Trump vowed a massive show of force to end violent protests over the death of a black man in police custody. Law enforcement, including officers on horseback, moved on protesters in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House as Trump made his remarks from the Rose Garden.The president pledged to end six nights of looting and violence in major cities across the nation “now,” saying he would deploy the U.S. military if state governors refused to call out the National Guard. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.”The police action against protesters cleared the way for Trump to walk from the White House to nearby St. John’s Episcopal Church along with other officials including U.S. Attorney General William Barr. Trump posed for photos at the church, which suffered minor damage the night before, holding up a Bible.The security forces that moved against protesters at the White House included National Guard military police, Secret Service, Department of Homeland Security police as well as District of Columbia police. Just a few hours later, thousands of people marched through the streets of Brooklyn, shouting “justice now!” while cars drove alongside, some drivers honking in support while police vans followed.A smaller march took place in Hollywood, where protesters defied a curfew imposed by Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti to march to a line of police, where they knelt down with their arms raised.‘MECHANICAL ASPHYXIATION’Anti-police brutality marches and rallies, which have turned violent after dark each night over the last week, erupted over the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American who died in Minneapolis police custody after being pinned beneath a white officer’s knee for nearly nine minutes.A second autopsy ordered by Floyd’s family and released on Monday found that his death was a homicide by “mechanical asphyxiation,” meaning that physical force interfered with his oxygen supply. The report says three officers contributed to Floyd’s death. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner then released details of its autopsy findings that also said Floyd’s death was a homicide caused by asphyxiation. The county report added that Floyd suffered cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by police and that he had arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease, fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use.Derek Chauvin, the 44-year-old Minneapolis police officer who kneeled on Floyd, was arrested on third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges. Three other officers involved in the arrest have not been charged. Floyd’s death was the latest case of police brutality against black men caught on videotape and prompting an outcry over racism in U.S. law enforcement. It reignited simmering racial tensions in a politically divided country that has been hit hard by the pandemic, with African Americans accounting for a disproportionately high number of cases. Dozens of cities across the United States remain under curfews not seen since riots after the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The National Guard deployed in 23 states and Washington, D.C.The curfews were imposed as most Americans were still emerging from weeks of strict “stay-at-home” orders imposed in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.On Monday, dozens of people paid their respects to Floyd outside Cup Foods, the scene of his death, leaving flowers and signs. A little girl wrote, “I’ll fight with you,” in aqua blue chalk in the road.“This is therapeutic. My heart was real heavy this morning so I came down extra early and when I got here, the heaviness lifted,” said Diana Jones, 40, the mother of four children. “This right here let’s me know that things are going to be OK.”Terrence Floyd, the victim’s brother, told the gathering he wanted people to get educated and vote rather than resort to violence and destruction. “Let’s do this another way,” he said. Trump, a Republican, has condemned the killing of Floyd and promised justice but has described protesters as “thugs.” Opponents accuse him of stoking conflict and racial tension when he should be uniting the nation and addressing underlying issues, and his campaign-style appearance at St. John’s Church sparked criticism.“I am outraged,” Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes the church, said on CNN. Trump’s message was antithetical to church teachings, she said. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo criticized the use of force against demonstrators to make way for Trump to hold the picture-taking opportunity. “It was really, truly shameful,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-fire-rubber-bullets-tear-gas-to-disperse-peaceful-protest-near-white-house/story-X6cTooB49CrOEwaURw4WdJ.html
02-06-2020||World||George Floyd died of ‘neck compression’, says medical examiner||A medical examiner on Monday classified George Floyd’s death as a homicide, saying his heart stopped as police restrained him and compressed his neck, in a widely seen video that has sparked protests across the nation.“Decedent experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s),” the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office said in a news release. Cause of death was listed as “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression.”Under “other significant conditions” it said Floyd suffered from heart disease and hypertension, and listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use. Those factors were not listed under cause of death.A Minneapolis police officer was charged last week with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, and three other officers were fired. Bystander video showed the officer, Derek Chauvin, holding his knee on Floyd’s neck despite the man’s cries that he can’t breathe until he eventually stopped moving.A separate autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family also called his death a homicide. It concluded that that he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression, said the family’s attorney, Ben Crump, who called for the charge against Chauvin to be upgraded to first-degree murder and for three other officers to be charged. He didn’t say what the charges against the other officers should be.That autopsy, by a forensic pathologist who also examined Eric Garner’s body, found the compression cut off blood to Floyd’s brain, and that the pressure of other officers’ knees on his back made it impossible for him to breathe, Crump said.Both the medical examiner and the family’s experts differed from the description in last week’s criminal complaint against the officer of how Floyd died. The complaint, citing preliminary findings from the medical examiner, listed the effects of being restrained, along with underlying health issues and potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system. But it also said nothing was found “to support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” Neither side has released its full autopsy report so far.The family’s autopsy found no evidence of heart disease and concluded he had been healthy.Floyd, a black man who was in handcuffs at the time, died after Chauvin, who is white, ignored bystander shouts to get off Floyd and Floyd’s cries that he couldn’t breathe. His death sparked days of protests in Minneapolis and around America.The complaint provided no details about intoxicants. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller described the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.”Floyd’s family and attorneys, like the families of other black men killed by police, commissioned their own autopsy because they didn’t trust local authorities to produce an unbiased report.The family’s autopsy was done by Michael Baden and Allecia Wilson. Baden is the former chief medical examiner of New York City, and was hired to do an autopsy of Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe.Baden also did an autopsy at the family’s request for Michael Brown, an 18-year-old shot by police in Ferguson, Missouri. He said Brown didn’t reveal signs of a struggle, casting doubt on a claim by police that a struggle between Brown and the officer led to the shooting.Dr. Judy Melinek, a forensic pathologist from the San Francisco Bay area who blogs about the subject and is not connected with the case, said the key difference between the medical examiner’s conclusions and those of Baden and Walker are the official finding of “significant” conditions for Floyd, including heart disease and drugs in his system.Baden and Wilson acknowledged on a conference call with reporters that they didn’t have access to the tissue samples that the medical examiner kept that might have given more information on his health. Nor did they have their own toxicology results yet.Melinek said it’s not unusual for different pathologists to reach different determinations, given that they may be looking at different information and that they’ve had different experiences and training.Under the law, a medical examiner determines the cause and manner of death, but it’s up to prosecutors to decide whether criminal charges are warranted. The term homicide means only that a person’s death was caused by another person.Chauvin, who was also charged with manslaughter, is being held in a state prison. The other three officers on scene, like Chauvin, were fired the day after the incident but have not been charged.The head of the Minneapolis police union said in a letter to members that the officers were fired without due process and labor attorneys are fighting for their jobs. Lt. Bob Kroll, the union president, also criticized city leadership, saying a lack of support is to blame for the days of sometimes violent protests.When asked to respond, Mayor Jacob Frey said Kroll’s opposition to reform and lack of empathy for the community has undermined trust in the police.Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that Attorney General Keith Ellison would take the lead in any prosecutions in Floyd’s death. Local civil rights activists have said Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman doesn’t have the trust of the black community. They have protested outside his house, and pressed him to charge the other three officers.Freeman remains on the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/floyd-s-heart-stopped-while-restrained-says-medical-examiner/story-G7ExB6oEb38L4pEeBkQkbO.html
02-06-2020||World||South America ignores Europe and reopens as virus peak nears||South American countries on Monday began easing COVID-19 restrictions even as the region hurtles toward its viral peak, disregarding the example set by European nations that were battered earlier by the virus.Some of Brazil’s hardest hit cities, including the jungle metropolis Manaus and coastal Rio de Janeiro, are starting to allow more activity. Bolivia’s government authorized reopening most of the country and the government of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro unwound restrictions. Ecuador’s airports were resuming flights and shoppers returning to some of Colombia’s malls.Rolling back measures runs counter to Europe’s approach of waiting for the worst to pass before resuming activity, and South America trails much further behind on its viral curve. Even European nations that lifted restrictions earliest in their respective outbreaks – the U.K. and Russia - did so only after clearing their initial peaks.The executive director of the World Health Organization’s emergencies program, Mike Ryan, expressed concern over South America’s climbing contagion, telling reporters Monday that the region had become an “intense zone of transmission for this virus,” which had not yet reached its peak.“Clearly the situation in many South American countries is far from stable. There is a rapid increase in cases and those systems are coming under increasing pressure,” he said.Data from the WHO’s Pan American Health Organisation shows the region’s seven-day rolling average of new cases continues rising, due in large part to Brazil, which accounts for more than half the total.Manaus, the Amazon rainforest’s largest city, was the first Brazilian metropolis whose health care system collapsed. For weeks, overwhelmed intensive-care units were unable to admit patients, deaths at home surged and a city cemetery buried bodies in mass graves.Such burials continue, yet the capital of Amazonas state on Monday began loosening its clamp on non-essential businesses. Amazonas registered 818 new COVID-19 cases Sunday, bringing the total number of cases above 40,000. There are more than 500,000 confirmed cases in Brazil, the second most in the world, and experts believe the true toll to be much higher due to insufficient testing.Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian city with the second-most cases after Sao Paulo, on Monday announced it would begin gradually relaxing restrictions the following day. A Already a city in its metropolitan region, Sao Joao de Meriti, started allowing salons, auto mechanics, and hotels to operate on Monday.“Brazil tends to look at Europe, and the problem is that there they did one or two months of strict quarantine and are now reopening,” said Renato Mendes Coutinho, a specialist in mathematical biology at COVID-19 BR Observatory, an independent group of more than 50 Brazilian researchers. “The difference is that the lockdown they implemented and the restriction measures were much more efficient and thorough.” Ecuador was one of the first South American nations slammed, with grim scenes of people leaving corpses outside their doorsteps in Guayaquil through March and April. The nation’s caseload continues to surge, yet its airport will resume international flights on June 3, according to Nicolás Romero, the airport’s spokesperson, though he said arriving passengers must spend 15 days in quarantine, without specifying how such quarantine will be enforced.The airport in capital, Quito, recorded its first flight in 80 days on Monday, and flights to Miami and Houston will take off on June 4.“It has just been one flight so far, but the important thing is the message it gives, of flying safely,” Luis Galárraga, the airport’s spokesperson, told The Associated Press.Across Ecuador’s border, Colombia has shut the international airport in its capital, Bogotá, until September and locked down an entire working-class district home to 1.5 million people. But in the nation’s second city, Medellin, malls cautiously began opening their doors on Monday, though checking customers’ temperatures upon entry.

02-06-2020||World||Trump describes protests in US as ‘terror’, threatens to deploy military||President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to deploy US military troops in towns and cities where local officials failed to stop the violence, looting and vandalism that have accompanied protests, which he described as “terror”, against the death of an African American man in police custody.In a speech from the White House, the president said he has asked state officials to deploy military reservists of the National Guard in “sufficient numbers to dominate the streets”. If a state of official refuses, he said, “I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them”.’To protesters, he said, “I want the organisers of this terror to be on notice that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail.”The president also said he had ordered “swift and decisive action” to bring the situation under control in Washington DC.Even as he spoke, National Guard troops moved up to the front of the phalanx of law enforcement personnel facing protesters outside the White House. Flash-bang bombs, tear gas shells and rubber bullets were used to disperse a peaceful demonstration from a side of the White House facing Lafayette Square, a park that is an unofficial venue for White House protests.The president walked out of the White House shortly after and headed to a church on one side of the park that was damaged by protesters Sunday night. He was accompanied by some members of his cabinet such as Mark Esper and William Barr and new chief of staff Mark Meadows and son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka trump.The president held up a copy of the Bible on he steps of the church, which was closed, and posed for pictures with some members of the entourage. Church officials told reporters later the president was there without their permission and wanted to have nothing to do with his appearance.“Greatest country in the world,” Trump said when asked for what message he was seeking to deliver. “And we’re going to keep it safe.”Critics saw it as a stunt to counter the uncharitable but brutal blowback for taking shelter in an underground bunker on the first night of protests at the White House last Friday. The president, who likes to project himself as a tough-guy, has been seething over the scorn and mockery that followed.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who had praised Trump for federal help deal with Covid-19 in a state that had became the epicentre of the global and American epidemic, was characteristically blunt. “Calling out the American military for a photo opportunity. That’s what it was. I mean, it was shameful. It was really, truly shameful.”Trump had berated governors, specially those of the Democratic party, in a conference call earlier for being “weak” against protesters and had pressed them to do more, essentially giving them the same message that he delivered in the evening form the White House - “dominate” the streets with heavy presence of law enforcement personnel, including National Guard reservists.The president’s threat to deploy soldiers triggered debate about whether he had legal authority to do do. Under the Insurrection Act, a more than 200-year-old law, the president can deploy US military on American soil to deal with civil disorder, insurrection or rebellion.But it was last used at the request of a state, California in1992 to send troops into Los Angeles, a city rocked by protests in the aftermath of the acquittal of police officers accused of severely beating Rodney King, an African American man.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-describes-protests-in-us-as-terror-threatens-to-deploy-military/story-5Pou3Mdv3yqVXTXmxLljxI.html

Pakistan is facing a balance of payment crisis with the fiscal deficit likely to rise as high as 9.4% and the revenue shortfall.In a televised address, Khan said the country couldn’t afford to match the losses incurred during the lockdown as many other countries had done. He cited 50 million people who live below the poverty line and 25 million daily wagers. Khan said his government gave cash handouts to the poor, which wasn’t possible to continue on such a large scale, adding around 130 million to 150 million people were adversely affected by the coronavirus shutdowns. “Our conditions don’t allow that we keep feeding money to them, how long we can give them money,” Khan said.Khan was reluctant to call for a sweeping lockdown, so instead, the country’s four provinces ordered their own closures.“Unfortunately, the way lockdown occurred, that was very painful for our lower class,” Khan said, adding that the lockdown had affected the country’s tax-revenue collections. He defended his decision to reopen, arguing lockdowns don’t stop the virus.“You will have to understand this coronavirus, it’s not going to go unless a vaccine is discovered. We have to live with the coronavirus. The entire world has reached this conclusion,” Khan said, pointing to eased restrictions in US states.“Today, America, the richest country in the world, where 100,000 people have died because of corona, they too have decided that their economy would collapse if they (continue) a lockdown,” Khan said.He urged people to act responsibly but added that more infections and deaths were inevitable.“This virus will spread more. I have to say it with regret that there will be more deaths,” Khan said.“I request you all to please follow SOPs (standard operating procedures), as we are opening everything on the conditions of these SOPs,” Khan said in his address, warning people will suffer if they do not take precautions.According to its health ministry, 28,245 Covid-19 cases have been diagnosed in Sindh, 26,240 in Punjab, 10,027 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 4,393 in Balochistan, 2,589 in Islamabad, 711 in Gilgit-Baltistan and 255 in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The ministry showed that 26,083 patients have recovered so far from the virus and authorities have conducted 561,136 tests.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-lifts-lockdown-amid-rising-covid-19-cases-urges-pakistan-to-live-with-the-virus/story-9lmwJzHv9zc0owqy3GQW4M.html
02-06-2020||World||US adversaries highlight unrest to undercut criticism||Standing at a lectern with a backdrop map of the world behind him reminiscent of one at the State Department, the spokesman of Iran’s Foreign Ministry made a point Monday to criticize the US in English amid ongoing protests over police killings of black people.“To the American people, the world has ... heard your outcry over this state oppression,” Abbas Mousavi told reporters in Tehran.So too have Washington’s adversaries in Iran and elsewhere.Long the target of American criticism, these nations have used the protests over the killing of George Floyd as an opportunity to hit back at the country held up by US leaders for decades as “the shining city upon a hill.”By putting forth images of the unrest, they portray the US as a hypocritical superpower unable to secure its own people, as well as normalizing the violence and repression they visit on their own citizens.“To be clear, though they are trying to sympathize with protesters in the US, their aim is to leverage the internal divisions in America, ... not to advance the debate on this,” said Ariane Tabatabai, a Middle East fellow who studies Iran at the Washington-based German Marshall Fund.“Regime officials particularly like the theme of racial tensions in the US because it allows them to point the finger at Washington, which is often front and center condemning human rights abuses by the regime,” she said.That’s particularly valuable to Iran, which has violently put down recent nationwide economic demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access. The Islamic Republic has seen its already-ailing economy crater since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew Washington from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers, cutting off its oil sales.“The American regime is pursuing violence and bullying at home and abroad,” Mousavi said.That criticism has extended to Twitter, which Iranian officials use extensively despite the website being banned since the mass protests and crackdown surrounding its disputed 2009 presidential election.Former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose disputed re-election sparked the 2009 unrest, called Floyd’s killing “disturbing & upsetting.”Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif offered a rewritten statement earlier issued by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, crossing out Iran and replacing it with America.Pompeo responded by tweeting: “You hang homosexuals, stone women and exterminate Jews.”State-controlled media in China saw the protests through the prism of American views on Hong Kong’s anti-government demonstrations, which China has long said the US encouraged. In a commentary, the ruling Communist Party newspaper Global Times said Chinese experts had noted that US politicians might think twice before commenting again on Hong Kong, knowing “their words might backfire.”Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian offered his own criticism at a Beijing news conference.The protests “once again reflect the racial discrimination in the US, the serious problems of police violent enforcement and the urgency of solving these problems,” Zhao said.He added that China hopes the US will “safeguard and guarantee the legal rights of ethnic minorities.” That’s as China continues a yearslong, massive crackdown that has locked away more than 1 million ethnic minorities, most of them Muslims.In North Korea, the country’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper reported about the demonstrations, saying that protesters “harshly condemned” a white policeman’s “lawless and brutal murder” of a black citizen.Three large photos showed protests from recent days from Minneapolis, where Floyd died May 25 after a white police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes. The officer was fired and charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the three other officers at the scene be prosecuted.Rodong Sinmun noted hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting, “No justice, no peace.” It did not make any direct comments about Trump, whom North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has met three times in high-profile summits.Russia said the United States had systemic human rights problems, criticism that followed a pattern dating to the Cold War. The 1957 integration of Little Rock Central High School by nine African American students supported by bayonet-carrying soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division saw one Soviet newspaper use the headline: “Troops Advance Against Children!”That information warfare continues today in the cyber-realm, as US intelligence agencies say Russia meddled America’s 2016 presidential election. Tabatabai said she and her colleagues had been tracking Chinese, Iranian and Russian social media accounts using the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloyd.US allies as well have been expressing their own opinions on the unrest. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the arrests and assaults on journalists were “very concerning.” Zimbabwe summoned the US ambassador over US national security adviser Robert O’Brien’s allegation this weekend that Harare could be one of several foreign adversaries taking advantage of the demonstrations.Meanwhile, Germany’s center-left Social Democratic Party, which is a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition, on Monday described itself as “157 (years old) and Antifa. Naturally.”The tweet appeared to be a response to Trump’s assertion that he would designate Antifa, an umbrella description for the far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations and other events, “a terrorist organization.”Across from the US Embassy in Paris, dozens of people knelt in silent protest, urging the French government to take racism and police violence more seriously. Despite a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people because of the coronavirus, they held signs reading “I Can’t Breathe” in English, or “Racism is suffocating us” and “We are all George Floyd” in French.Thousands of people packed Dam Square in central Amsterdam and spilled into several side streets in an unexpectedly large protest to denounce police brutality in the US and Europe. They chanted “Black lives matter!” raising their fists and holding anti-racism signs.In Perth, Australia, the hundreds of demonstrators who peacefully protested Floyd’s death also sought to highlight injustices against indigenous Australians.“I believe it’s important as a young indigenous woman to vocalise that this isn’t just an American issue, this is a black people issue and indigenous people fit into that category,” organizer Tanesha Bennell told Nine Network television.Protesters carried banners with messages including “No Pride in Genocide” and tears appeared as the names of indigenous people who have died in Australian police custody were read to the crowd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-adversaries-highlight-unrest-to-undercut-criticism/story-IaD9VVaepx6Pry66YrPc9O.html
02-06-2020||World||Hundreds of Facebook employees walk out over Zuckerberg’s inaction on Trump’s posts||Facebook employees walked away from their work-from-home desks on Monday and took to Twitter to accuse Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg of inadequately policing US President Donald Trump’s posts as strictly as the rival platform has done.Reuters saw dozens of online posts from employees critical of Zuckerberg’s decision to leave Trump’s most inflammatory verbiage unchallenged where Twitter had labelled it. Some top managers participated in the protest, reminiscent of a 2018 walkout at Alphabet Inc’s Google over sexual harassment.It was a rare case of staff publicly taking their CEO to task, with one employee tweeting that thousands participated. Among them were all seven engineers on the team maintaining the React code library which supports Facebook’s apps.In photos: Rage and anguish from George Floyd protests spreading across US cities“Facebook’s recent decision to not act on posts that incite violence ignores other options to keep our community safe. We implore the Facebook leadership to #TakeAction,” they said in a joint statement published on Twitter. The React Core team is joining the Facebook employee walkout in solidarity with the Black community.Facebookʼs recent decision to not act on posts that incite violence ignores other options to keep our community safe. We implore the Facebook leadership to #TakeAction. pic.twitter.com/0i33nNQTLN“Mark is wrong, and I will endeavor in the loudest possible way to change his mind,” wrote Ryan Freitas, identified on Twitter as director of product design for Facebook’s News Feed. He added he had mobilized “50+ likeminded folks” to lobby for internal change. Mark is wrong, and I will endeavor in the loudest possible way to change his mind.A Facebook employee said Zuckerberg’s weekly Friday question-and-answer session would be moved up this week to Tuesday.Katie Zhu, a product manager at Instagram, tweeted a screenshot showing she had entered “#BLACKLIVESMATTER” to describe her request for time off as part of the walkout.Facebook Inc will allow employees participating in the protest to take the time off without drawing down their vacation days, spokesman Andy Stone said.Separately, online therapy company Talkspace said it ended partnership discussions with Facebook. Talkspace CEO Oren Frank tweeted he would “not support a platform that incites violence, racism, and lies.”Social justiceTech workers at companies including Facebook, Google, and Amazon.com Inc have pursued social justice issues in recent years, urging the companies to change policies. Employees “recognize the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our Black community,” Stone wrote in a text.“We encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership. As we face additional difficult decisions around content ahead, we’ll continue seeking their honest feedback.”Last week, nationwide unrest erupted after the death of a black man, George Floyd, in police custody in Minneapolis last Monday. Video footage showed a white officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes before he died. On Friday, Twitter Inc affixed a warning label to a Trump tweet that included the phrase “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Twitter said it violated rules against glorifying violence but was left up as a public interest exception.Facebook declined to act on the same message, and Zuckerberg sought to distance his company from the fight between the president and Twitter.On Friday, Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post that while he found Trump’s remarks “deeply offensive,” they did not violate company policy against incitements to violence and people should know whether the government was planning to deploy force.Zuckerberg’s post also said Facebook had been in touch with the White House to explain its policies.Jason Toff, a director of product management and former head of short-form video app Vine, was one of several Facebook employees organizing fundraisers for racial justice groups in Minnesota. Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook on Monday the company would contribute an additional $10 million to social justice causes.Toff tweeted: “I work at Facebook and I am not proud of how we’re showing up. The majority of coworkers I’ve spoken to feel the same way. We are making our voice heard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-of-facebook-employees-walk-out-over-zuckerberg-s-inaction-on-trump-s-posts/story-36GpTo94FnMp8xGfOxqAvJ.html
02-06-2020||World||‘Hate just hides’: Biden vows to take on systematic racism in US||Joe Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice Monday in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality.The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support.“Hate just hides. It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke.Without offering specifics, he promised to “deal with institutional racism” and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he’d be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and “access to capital” and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month.“I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,” Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. “I realize we’ve got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.”Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March.His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as “weak” during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.”Biden’s softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump’s much louder voice.On Monday evening, Trump declared himself “the president of law and order” from the White House as military police and law enforcement fired tear gas and cleared protesters from nearby Lafayette Park. Biden made no mention of the unfolding events during an online fundraiser that took place at the same time, though he talked at length about persistent racism in the U.S.“He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.”Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer.Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veterans’ memorial near his Wilmington home last week, and the former vice president’s campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd.In the early moments of Monday’s gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke.“The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer.Biden’s standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden’s flailing primary campaign, but it’s unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November.“I want to make something clear. I don’t expect anything from the black community,” Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black.”Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media.“To see the president of the United States say that he’s going to send the military into our communities but hadn’t mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,” said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.Much of Biden’s campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump’s handling of moments of racial tension.In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in.Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now.“I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That’s not who he is,” said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hate-just-hides-biden-vows-to-take-on-systematic-racism-in-us/story-yNg8tJCpKEIWrjcOgr2dlI.html
02-06-2020||World||Boris Johnson revamps agenda to meet worst UK recession in 300 years||Boris Johnson plans to re-set his government’s agenda with a major speech and a financial statement to prepare the U.K. for the new reality after the coronavirus pandemic.Amid forecasts of the worst recession in 300 years, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is drawing up options to bolster the economy after the government withdraws its vast package of financial support in the months ahead, according to people familiar with the matter.For Johnson, the priority will be to focus on reasserting his broader political mission in the age of the virus, one person said. The Conservative Party leader and public face of Brexit, Johnson was elected with a large majority just six months ago on a promise to “level up” the forgotten parts of the country.Yet his plans have been derailed by the global pandemic, with his government’s agenda put on ice as the coronavirus crisis took over. Work has begun on preparing for a key speech, expected at the end of June, one person said.On Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock promised more details on the “economic response” later this summer after he was asked about government preparations for a recession amid fears of bankruptcies and job losses.‘Working So Hard’“The economy’s going to have to change,” Hancock told the government’s daily virus briefing in London. “We’re going to have to be a different type of economy as we come out of this and you’re going to hear more of that from the chancellor and the prime minister, who’ve been working so hard on this, in the weeks and months to come.”Officials privately confirmed work is under way on a fiscal event but said it is too early to be precise about the detailed policy proposals, or about the date, though one person said it is likely to be in July.Among the questions that have been discussed among Johnson’s allies include whether there is potential to raise income tax or national insurance specifically to pay for investment in the National Health Service. Business taxes may also rise, as internal polling suggests there is public support for increases in corporation tax.Support MeasuresOther options could include a windfall tax on sectors that have profited during the pandemic -- such as supermarkets or technology companies, one person familiar with discussions said.Sunak, who has spent unprecedented amounts supporting the UK economy during the coronavirus crisis, kept the spending taps firmly on last week as he announced plans to taper his job support program, unveiling an incremental withdrawal in a bid to avert a mass wave of unemployment this summer.The self-employed will be offered a grant of as much as 6,570 pounds ($8,205) in August to cover another three months of earnings, while furloughed workers will continue to receive 80% of wages through October. Employers will only start taking the burden of their National Insurance and pension contributions in August, before paying 10% of workers’ wages in September, and 20% the following month, the chancellor said.The two jobs’ plans are currently supporting 10.7 million jobs, and have come at a cost of almost 22 billion pounds. The cost of both programs could easily breach 100 billion pounds, about 11% of total government spending in a normal year and equivalent to the amount spent on the National Health Service, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-revamps-agenda-to-meet-worst-uk-recession-in-300-years/story-A6lDmwvovGE9sauAVT8E7L.html
02-06-2020||World||Trump threatens to deploy military amid rising protests against police violence||Amid racial unrest across the nation, President Donald Trump on Monday declared himself “the president of law and order” and threatened to deploy the United States military to American cities to quell a rise of violent protests. As Trump spoke, an incredible TV split screen developed around the White House. While he addressed the nation in the White House’s idyllic Rose Garden, a series of military vehicles rolled out front on Pennsylvania Avenue and military police and law enforcement clashed with protesters at Lafayette Park. Trump said he would mobilize “thousands and thousands” of soldiers to keep the peace if governors did not use the National Guard to shut down the protests. Loud tear gas explosions could be heard as authorities moved what appeared to be peaceful protests in the park. The escalation came just after Attorney General William Barr came to the park to to survey the demonstrators. According to senior defense officials, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were being sent to Washington to provide assistance. Those troops were either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. Under the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act, federal troops are prohibited from performing domestic law enforcement actions such as making arrests, seizing property or searching people. In extreme cases, however, the president can invoke the Insurrection Act, also from the Civil War, which allows the use of active-duty or National Guard troops for law enforcement. The officials said that some of the National Guard in DC will be armed and others will not. They said that the DC guard members do not have non-lethal weapons. The military police that are visible in the city are members of the Guard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-declares-he-s-president-of-law-order-amid-protests/story-sC0e0F2kTzFN25961khx0I.html
02-06-2020||World||Gilead says Remdesivir Drug helped moderately ill Covid-19 patients||A California biotech company said on Monday that its experimental drug remdesivir improved symptoms when given for five days to moderately ill, hospitalised patients with Covid-19.Gilead Sciences gave few details on Monday, but said full results would soon be published in a medical journal.Remdesivir is the only treatment that’s been shown in a rigorous experiment to help fight the coronavirus. A large study led by the National Institutes of Health recently found it could shorten average recovery time from 15 days to 11 days in hospitalised patients with severe disease.The drug is given through an IV and is designed to interfere with an enzyme the virus uses to copy its genetic material. It’s approved for treating Covid-19 in Japan and is authorised for emergency use in the US for certain patients.The company-led study involved nearly 600 patients who had moderate pneumonia but did not need oxygen support. All were randomly assigned to get five or 10 days of the drug plus standard care, or standard care alone. Patients and their doctors knew who was getting what, which limits the objectivity of the results.By the 11th day in the study, those on five days of remdesivir were 65% more likely to improve by at least one on a seven-point scale, Gilead said.Ten days of treatment did not prove better than standard care alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gilead-says-remdesivir-drug-helped-moderately-ill-covid-19-patients/story-zqNKqNZylbXQqL3WFEho5K.html
02-06-2020||World||4,000 across US arrested as protests over George Floyd’s death continue||Around 4,000 people across the United States have been arrested during the massive protests over the death of African-American man George Floyd last month.The first arrests were made on May 26 and since then there have been around 4,000 arrests across the US so far, CNN reported.While the anger continues to spread, the country is waiting for an address from President Donald Trump about the protests following the death of Floyd.On Friday night (local time), Trump had briefly moved to an underground bunker as violence raged outside the White House. He again took shelter on Sunday night.Meanwhile, several organisations like Google and YouTube have expressed support for racial equality.Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai shared a picture of Google homepage which had a black ribbon at the bottom with a message that read, “We stand in support of racial equality and all those who search for it.”Also, YouTube’s official Twitter handle’s icon has been changed to black from red.Protests erupted in Minneapolis and other US cities last Tuesday after Floyd died following his arrest by four officers.A viral video showed a police officer, Derek Chauvin, pinning the 46-year-old Floyd to the ground with his knee on his neck for nearly eight minutes. Floyd died at a local hospital shortly thereafter.The four police officers were fired. Chauvin was also charged with murder and manslaughter, according to Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-000-across-us-arrested-as-protests-over-george-floyd-s-death-continue/story-jSLN2FEXSnugQLNtVBthRK.html
02-06-2020||World||Europe loosens lockdown as Coronavirus tightens grip on Americas||Europe took bolder steps in easing coronavirus lockdowns Monday, with some pubs, tourist sites, pools and schools reopening despite fears of a second wave of infections, while in Latin America new cases piled up past the one million mark.The pandemic has now killed more than 372,000 people and infected at least 6.1 million since erupting in China last year -- and efforts to halt its spread by imposing restrictions on everyday life have plunged several economies into recession. The United States, where the ongoing crisis has now been overshadowed by anti-racism protests provoked by police killings, is by some distance the worst affected country, but cases are also spreading quickly in Latin America, particularly in troubled giant Brazil.Nevertheless, from Russia to France, Italy and Britain, countries have started to emerge from months-long lockdowns, cautiously adopting a post-pandemic version of normal. Bars began to serve again n Finland and Finland -- albeit with distancing restrictions or shortened hours -- while some schools in Britain and Greece opened their doors again. But the decision to allow schools to partially reopen in Britain drew criticism from some who accuse Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government of moving too fast to end a lockdown that he has been accused of being too slow to impose.“Covid-19 spreading too fast to lift lockdown in England,” scientific advisor Jeremy Farrar said on Twitter.There has also been scepticism in Russia, where Moscow shopping malls and parks reopened on Monday despite the still-high number of cases, although there was also cautious hope among shopkeepers eager to see business pick up again. “We opened two hours ago but we already have a few clients. I’m pretty optimistic, I think people will come back little by little,” Olga told AFP at her shop selling handbags and jewelry in central Moscow. While reopening parts of his own country, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin also called Armenia’s Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to wish him a speedy recovery, as he became the latest leader to test positive.‘Beloved beer’Elsewhere in Europe, still bolder steps were taken. Greece opened some hotels, schools, pools and tattoo parlours, while in Slovenia a mandatory rule to wear masks was eased as the country declared the end of the outbreak.Slovenes enjoyed a fly-over by US and local military jets to mark the “end of the pandemic” and to thank frontline health workers, while in Romania excited families queued for the reopening of Bucharest’s Grigore Antipa Natural History Museum.“I love animals, dinosaurs!” declared seven-year-old Robert, as his mum Manuela expressed relief that the lockdown was ending and she could bring him out to follow his passion. “It was his most ardent wish,” she smiled.Rome’s famed Colosseum also opened to visitors -- Italian nationals only -- for the first time since March, drawing sparse crowds. “We took advantage of the fact that foreign tourists aren’t here yet,” said Pierluigi, adding that it was his first visit to the massive ancient amphitheatre.And in South Africa, scores of people queued outside liquor stores in the Johannesburg township of Soweto, waiting to stock up after a nine-week ban on alcohol sales.The mood was festive with customers carrying crates of empty beer bottles, blasting loud music from their stereos.“We are overwhelmed, over the moon, so excited. This place is jamming,” said Bongani Khumalo. “I’m here to buy my beloved beer,” said 31-year-old Anele Mapoma. “It has been a while since I had a taste of that foam and burping.” 1 million cases The pandemic has devastated the global economy, which is facing its worst downturn since the Great Depression. With businesses and citizens growing tired of confinement, there is pressure on many leaders to press on with reopenings -- especially in nations where outbreaks appear to be slowing.But health experts have continued to warn of the possibility of a second wave of infections if authorities and citizens let their guard down.Brazil has more than half a million known infections and the second highest caseload in the world after the US, but President Jair Bolsonaro has defied lockdown recommendations and many of his supporters dismiss the disease as a myth.In a grim new landmark, infections in Latin America and the Caribbean surged past one million, according to an AFP tally based on official sources. In the United States -- the worst-affected nation in the world, and now faced with a wave of street protests against police killings of unarmed black suspects -- Washington and Los Angeles resumed outdoor dining, while New York City is on track to begin reopening from June 8.The US now has more than 104,000 coronavirus deaths and over 1.7 million cases. Meanwhile, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, there was a reminder that while much of the world struggles with coronavirus, other infectious threats continue. The health ministry reported a fresh Ebola outbreak in the northwest of the huge central African country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-loosens-lockdown-as-coronavirus-tightens-grip-on-americas/story-fAPvG87WrYBMvPgiWqCPSJ.html
02-06-2020||World||Indian government rejects Pakistan’s assertions about expelled officials||India rejected Pakistan’s contention that two of its high commission staff were detained on unsubstantiated charges and tortured, people familiar with developments said on Monday that the officials were caught red handed while indulging in spying. New Delhi on Sunday expelled two junior officials of the Pakistan high commission after they were detained during an operation by the Delhi Police and Military Intelligence while trying to obtain classified documents on security installations. Pakistan condemned India’s decision to declare the two officials persona non grata and to expel them, saying they were detained on “false and unsubstantiated charges”. A statement from Pakistan’s Foreign Office also contended that the two men were tortured and threatened to “accept false charges” despite identifying themselves as diplomatic staff. “The assertions of the Pakistan Foreign Office are false. The two officials were caught red handed while indulging in espionage activities,” said one of the people cited above, speaking on condition of anonymity. “They did not disclose their identity that they were high commission officials. When they were taken into custody and questioned, they confessed to indulging in espionage and also informed that they were high commission officials,” the person added. The Pakistani mission was immediately informed and the two men were handed over, the person said. “They were never subjected to any torture. They have also undergone medical examination. Pakistan appears to be making false accusations and possibly creating ground for some tit for tat reaction and torture of Indian officials in Islamabad,” the person cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-government-rejects-pakistan-s-assertions-about-expelled-officials/story-ptFEsA3Ol0eLd6DWrBIVzN.html
02-06-2020||World||‘I can’t breathe’ protests spread across America after Minneapolis killing||Thousands of protesters stormed the perimeter of Barclays Center in New York as protests spread across the United States over the killing of George Floyd, a Minneapolis black man who died after being pinned by the neck under a white police officer’s knee.Police made scores of arrests at Friday’s massive demonstration in Brooklyn, loading cuffed protesters onto city buses lined up on Atlantic Avenue, shutting down a major thoroughfare. A diverse group of protesters cheered to hip hop music and tried to argue about police brutality with police officers in riot gear, who occasionally lunged into crowds to pluck people out for arrest after bottles and other projectiles were thrown.The demonstrators at a “We can’t breathe” vigil and rally in lower Manhattan were pressing for legislation outlawing the police “chokehold” used by a city police officer in the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was also black. ATLANTAIn an impassioned speech, Bernice King, the youngest daughter of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., implored people to go home after more than 1,000 protesters marched to the state capitol from the Centennial Olympic Park, blocking traffic and an interstate highway along the way.“The only way we get what we really want is through non-violence,” Bernice King said in her father’s hometown. “Let’s do this the non-violent way to deal with the evil of our time.”King was assassinated in 1968, a year after race riots spread across many big cities.The Atlanta demonstration turned chaotic and at times violent. Fires were burning in downtown Atlanta near the CNN Center, the network’s headquarters.At least one police car was among several vehicles burnt. Windows were smashed at the CNN building, along with store fronts. Police pushed back the crowd, but they hurled bottles at officers.MINNEAPOLISHundreds of protesters defied an 8 p.m. curfew to gather in the streets around a police station burnt the previous night.“We are out here because we, as a generation, realize things have to change,” said one marcher, Paul Selman, a 25-year-old black man, who had just graduated with a master’s degree in English from Minnesota State. “We need peace.” “Our parents and grandparents are tired of seeing their kids die all of the time, so we have to take it upon ourselves to make a better future.”Peter McMahon, 26, a resident of the area around the police station and owner of two nearby properties, said, “This is my generation and these are the people I went to high school with,” adding, “This is not a surprise. I have lost good friends over this Black Lives Matter shit.”DETROITHundreds in the automotive capital joined a “March Against Police Brutality” late in the afternoon outside the Detroit Public Safety Headquarters. Many chanted, “No justice, no peace.” Some carried signs that read, “End police brutality” and “I won’t stop yelling until everyone can breathe.”DENVERDenver saw a second day of protests after hundreds marched peacefully through its downtown demanding justice for Floyd.On Thursday night, Denver police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds after parked cars were vandalized. There were 13 arrests related to the protests.HOUSTONHundreds gathered on Friday in a protest organized by the group Black Lives Matter at City Hall. The crowd spilled onto Interstate 45’s entrance ramp near downtown chanting, “I can’t breathe,” and “No justice, no peace.” LOUISVILLEAfter a night of violence in which at least seven people were shot, police in the Kentucky city braced for more protests over the killing of Floyd and several others, such as Breonna Taylor, shot by police in her Louisville home in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-can-t-breathe-protests-spread-across-america-after-minneapolis-killing/story-lPadfXDQf5QUPFgDZDZXsO.html
02-06-2020||World||Minneapolis cop who knelt on man’s neck charged with murder||The white Minneapolis police officer who knelt on George Floyd’s neck was arrested and charged with murder Friday, and authorities imposed an overnight curfew to try to stem three nights of often-violent protests that left dozens of stores burned and looted. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the case. He was also accused of ignoring another officer at the scene who expressed concerns about the black man as he lay handcuffed on the ground, pleading that he could not breathe. Floyd had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a small grocery store.Also Read: Officer who put knee on man’s neck should be charged, says Minneapolis mayor An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest, but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants all four officers involved to be arrested. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said more charges were possible. He said the investigation into the other three officers continues, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Meanwhile, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey declared a curfew from 8 pm to 6 am on Friday and Saturday. The order said no one can be out in public except emergency responders and people seeking medical care, fleeing danger or those who are homeless. “I know that whatever hope you feel today is tempered with scepticism and a righteous outrage,” Frey said in a statement. “Today’s decision from the County Attorney is an essential first step on a longer road toward justice and healing our city.” According to the criminal complaint, Chauvin allegedly disregarded the concerns of another officer, who wanted to roll Floyd onto his side as he was being held down. The papers also said that an autopsy revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. The exam concluded that the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. Floyd’s family was seeking an independent autopsy. Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car when he stiffened up and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, the complaint said. Chauvin and officer Tou Thoa arrived to help and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car, it said. At one point, Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the car’s passenger side, and Floyd, who was handcuffed, went to the ground face down. Officer JK Kueng held Floyd’s back, and officer Thomas Lane held his legs, while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever,” and Chauvin replied, “That’s why we have him on his stomach,” according to the complaint. After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Chauvin onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, the complaint said. In all, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, including nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking, according to the complaint. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. Freeman, whose home has been picketed by protesters, highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case just four days after Floyd’s death, but also defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. He said his office needed time to put together evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. All four officers at the scene of Floyd’s arrest on Monday were fired the next day. After the charges were announced, protesters outside government offices chanted, “All four got to go.” It was not immediately clear whether Chauvin’s arrest would quiet the unrest, which escalated again Thursday night as demonstrators burned a Minneapolis police station soon after officers abandoned it. Protests also spread across the US, fuelled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Governor Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to the protests and called for swift justice for the officers. Walz said the state had taken over the response to the violence. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” Trump later said he was referring to shooting that had happened during the protests.

02-06-2020||World||Minnesota governor apologizes for arrest of CNN crew||Following the arrest of a CNN crew on live television by police on Friday, an apologetic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz promised that journalists would not be interfered with in reporting on violent protests following the death of George Floyd.CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and two colleagues were released within an hour after network chief executive Jeff Zucker called Walz to demand answers about why they were led away and held in a police van.“We have got to ensure that there is a safe spot for journalism to tell this story,” Walz said.Jimenez and colleagues Bill Kirkos and Leonel Mendez were doing a live shot for CNN’s “New Day” shortly after 5 a.m. Central Time, describing a night of fire and anger in the wake of Floyd’s death after a Minneapolis police office knelt on his neck. Fired officer Derek Chauvin was charged with murder in that case later Friday.When first approached by officers, Jimenez, who is black, told them, “put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way.”After being told he was being arrested and his hands were tied behind his back, Jimenez asked why he was being arrested. He did not get an answer.The Minnesota State Patrol said on Twitter that the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order” following the protests. The patrol said the CNN journalists “were released once they were confirmed to be members of the media.”It’s not clear why they were confused: Jimenez was holding what appeared to be a laminated ID card before his hands were secured, and his fellow crew members told police that they were from CNN and showing the scene live on the air.“I’ve never seen anything like this,” CNN “New Day” co-anchor John Berman said.After being released, Jimenez said that he was glad that his arrest was shown on the air.“You don’t have to doubt my story,” he said. “It’s not filtered in any way. You saw it for your own eyes. That gave me a little bit of comfort. But it was definitely nerve-wracking.”At a later news conference, Walz said that “I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like that should happen ... This is a very public apology to that team.”The arrest drew widespread condemnation across the news industry. CNN competitors MSNBC, CBS News and Fox News all issued statements in support of Jimenez, along with the Society of Professional Journalists and the National Association of Black Journalists.CNN accepted Walz’s apology, saying the network appreciated the sincerity of his words.Walz’s words in support of journalists have impact at a time when the news media is often under attack, said Jane E. Kirtley, Silha Professor of Media Ethics and Law and director of the Silha Center at the University of Minnesota.“It’s really important for the governor to make that kind of statement to emphasize to everyone, especially law enforcement, that the press has an important job to do ... and they need to be respected,” said Kirtley, who lives blocks away from the protests and could still smell smoke from the fires on Friday.Later Friday, the network was again thrust into the story when hundreds of protesters confronted police outside CNN’s downtown Atlanta headquarters. Activists spray-painted a large CNN logo outside the building, breaking a window and tagging doors. One protester climbed on top of the CNN sign and waved a “Black Lives Matter” flag to cheers from the crowd.As anchor Chris Cuomo opened his prime-time show, he told viewers the network’s headquarters had been “swarmed and defaced.” Footage of the damage outside was mixed with scenes from other protests around the country.Meanwhile, there were signs Friday that cable news networks, who were spending much of their time covering the story, have become sensitive to the impact of showing witness video of Floyd’s treatment by police.News anchors on all three networks usually warned viewers of its graphic nature before showing the video.“I must warn you that this is difficult to watch,” said CNN’s Brianna Keilar, “but it is important to remember.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minnesota-governor-apologizes-for-arrest-of-cnn-crew/story-fuvzHegW3sLA5cSgJcnmbJ.html

People will still “be able to retweet with comment, but will not be able to like, reply or retweet it.”Twitter’s action came just hours after Trump said he would introduce legislation that may scrap or weaken a law that has protected internet companies, including Twitter and Facebook , in an extraordinary attempt to regulate social media platforms where he has been criticized.Also Read: Officer who put knee on man’s neck should be charged, says Minneapolis mayor....These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen.

02-06-2020||World||George Floyd protesters set Minneapolis police station afire||Cheering protesters broke into a Minneapolis police precinct station on Thursday after the department abandoned it, setting it ablaze and setting off fireworks as three days of violent protests spread to nearby St. Paul and angry demonstrations flared across the U.S over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man.A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel” shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set.Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket and cheering.Also Read: Twitter attaches disclaimer to Trump’s Minneapolis tweet for ‘glorifying violence’Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading that he can’t breathe as Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneels on his neck. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd died.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request, but it wasn’t immediately clear when and where the Guard was being deployed, and none could be seen during protests in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area.The Guard tweeted that a “key objective” was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was “here with the Minneapolis Fire Department” to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. A department spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a phone call. Fire Chief John Fruetel told CNN that the department couldn’t get to the scene for safety reasons.Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns.In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city’s main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses.Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song.” Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby.But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice.Floyd’s death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence.“Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black.Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing.Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters.“We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.”Hennepin County Sheriff David Hutchinson said the rally had been peaceful and there had been no arrests by late evening.After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death.“It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said.Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed.“WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition.Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing.“We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station.“What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said.Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage.Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood.“They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.”The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage.Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm but the city’s response to the protests was quickly questioned as things started spiraling into violence. “If the strategy was to keep residents safe — it failed,” City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who is black, tweeted. “Prevent property damage — it failed.” On Thursday, he urged police to leave the scene of the overnight violence, saying their presence brings people into the streets.But Eric Kowalczyk, a police captain in Baltimore during the Freddie Gray riots in 2015, generally supported the Minneapolis police strategy to avoid confrontations with protesters when possible, saying heavy-handed police responses are only met with more violence.“Nobody wants to see their city on fire, but at the same time, you don’t want to see citizens injured by the very police department they are protesting,” he said.Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis.Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said.Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes.The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect.The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. President Donald Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited.The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated.Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard.___Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, and Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-protesters-set-minneapolis-police-station-afire/story-lXOtbRAijTLLCZdm36NKwJ.html
02-06-2020||World||Trump tries a new response after George Floyd’s death||It was the kind of personal statement expected from a president in response to the disturbing video of a black man gasping for help as a white policeman pinned him to the street by the neck. But it was a very different tone for President Donald Trump, who has often been silent in the face of white-on-black violence and has a long history of defending police.“I feel very, very badly,” Trump said Thursday of George Floyd’s death while handcuffed and in the custody of Minneapolis police. “That’s a very shocking sight.”Once more likely to hew to the “blue lives matter” mantra, Trump and his allies are questioning an officer’s conduct and calling for justice for Floyd. But some activists doubt that Trump has suddenly evolved on the issue of police brutality and instead see election-year political calculations.“This is the first race-tinged case that I’ve ever heard him address” as president, said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and Trump critic who has known the president for decades. “So therefore he cannot be upset when people feel that it’s empty words because it is so out of character.”White House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump was taking the death seriously.“This has nothing to do with politics and is only about making sure justice is done, and anyone who suggests otherwise is only seeking to sow division and ignore the President’s unwavering support for the African-American community,” Deere said, citing Trump’s support for criminal justice reform legislation, Opportunity Zones and historically black colleges and universities.Trump has been silent on a number of high-profile police-involved killings, including that of Stephon Clark, a black man shot by Sacramento police in 2018.“This is something that is a local matter and that’s something that we feel should be left up to the local authorities,” then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at the time.He has never addressed the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold by police trying to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes. Video of the encounter was viewed millions of times online and Garner’s dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump has, however, invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.Trump has a long history of injecting himself into racially sensitive cases. In 1989, he took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of a brutal assault on a jogger. Trump has never apologized, telling reporters last year: “You have people on both sides of that.”Trump also spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And he has even appeared to advocate for the rougher treatment of people in police custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars.But Trump’s tone has changed in recent weeks as he has repeatedly expressed dismay at footage of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old black man fatally shot in February in Georgia while jogging.“You know, my heart goes out to the parents and the family and the friends,” he told reporters this month. “It’s a heartbreaking thing.”The president has notably left open the possibility of some other explanation, saying: “it could be something that we didn’t see on tape.”Trump and his allies have been even clearer on the death of Floyd, who can be heard and seen on tape pleading that he couldn’t breathe before he slowly stops talking and moving.Trump “was very upset when he saw that video,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Thursday. “He wants justice to be served.”Trump’s conservative allies also rallied to the cause.Fox News host Sean Hannity said he is “a big supporter of law enforcement,” but expressed outrage Wednesday night, telling his audience: “The lack of training here is breathtaking.”“It defies common sense. It defies training. It defies arrest policies and procedures. There was no resistance,” echoed Bernie Kerik, the former New York police commissioner pardoned by Trump.“We got to get to the very bottom of how this poor individual was treated, and the death of him on the video itself is shocking from what I saw,” said Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.Even conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who once called Black Lives Matter a “terrorist group,” said Thursday that Floyd’s death was totally “unjustified” and he was “so mad.”The outpouring comes as the Trump campaign has sought to chip into the advantage Democrats have with black voters. The campaign hopes either to win enough black support to keep pivotal states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in play or minimize enthusiasm for Democratic rival Joe Biden. There could be a small window after Biden last week told a prominent black radio host that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black,” a gaffe he later said he regretted.Trump and his allies have seized on that and other Biden statements, even though Biden, who served as vice president under the nation’s first black president, remains deeply popular among black voters, who helped him secure the Democratic nomination.Indeed, a recent Fox News poll found that just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of Trump, versus 75% who have a favorable view of Biden.Chris White, the longtime director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, questioned the sincerity of Republicans’ response to the deaths of Arbery and Floyd. The White House and Department of Justice have long had the power to address these issues.“Any time we hear politicians speaking about dealing with police brutality in the middle of election year, it’s just meaningless rhetoric that has a hollow promise,” he said.Sharpton credited both the magnitude of outrage in response to Floyd’s death as well as the upcoming election for the changed approach. But he doubted many black voters will be swayed with an approach they may see as too little, too late.“It’s like a father that misses a kid’s graduation of high school, graduation of college,” he said. “He can’t be upset when the kid looks at him suspiciously when he’s there when he graduates with his Ph.D.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-tries-a-new-response-after-george-floyd-s-death/story-foAxL9xfePHKZeXDHrt6fN.html
02-06-2020||World||Officer who put knee on man’s neck should be charged, says Minneapolis mayor||The mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges against the white police officer seen on video kneeling against the neck of a handcuffed black man who complained that he could not breathe and died in police custody.Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in the death of George Floyd. The footage by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s neck as Floyd gasps for breath on the ground with his face against the pavement. The officer does not move for at least eight minutes, even after Floyd stops speaking and moving.“I’ve wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white.He later added: “I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.”The day after Floyd died, Chauvin and three other officers were fired — an act that did not stem the flood of anger that followed the widely seen video shot on Memorial Day outside a convenience store.Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. A smaller protest was underway Wednesday afternoon outside the same precinct, with roughly a dozen officers behind barriers and a couple hundred protesters occasionally yelling at them and throwing objects.Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin’s suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door.Many activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd’s family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete.Floyd family attorney Ben Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests.“We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” he said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.”Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department’s culture.“One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said.The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons.Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota’s two top law enforcement officials — Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, both black — promised a thorough, transparent investigation. But Walz and Ellison didn’t endorse the mayor’s call to immediately charge the officer, saying the legal process needs to play out.“I understand the emotions are running high, and I think it’s important for the mayor to channel the emotion of the people who he represents. But I think it is critical that we adhere very closely to the facts and the law and the normal process,” Ellison said.The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, which would prosecute any state charges, issued a statement saying that Floyd’s death had “outraged us and people across the country” and that the case “deserves the best we can give.”The FBI was investigating whether officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights.Floyd’s death and that of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia have reopened the divide between minority communities and police that grew to a national uproar following the 2014 killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray and others.Speaking to reporters at Cape Canaveral, Florida, President Donald Trump called the death in Minneapolis “a very, very sad event” and said his administration was going to “look at it.” Later, he tweeted that he had asked for the federal investigation be expedited.Democrat Joe Biden said Floyd’s death was “part of an ingrained, systemic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country” and “cuts at the very heart of our sacred belief that all Americans are equal in rights.”It also “sends a very clear message to the black community and black lives that are under threat every single day,” Biden added, saying he was glad the mayor and the police department fired the officers, “but I don’t think that’s enough.”A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that police think the public does not understand the risks they face. A more recent study from September showed police were considered more trustworthy than Congress, but only 33% of black adults and half of Hispanics say they believe officers treat racial and ethnic groups equally.Shocking videos of black men dying continue to emerge during the pandemic, which is hitting communities of color harder than white communities. Floyd himself had been laid off from his nightclub security job in the pandemic, a friend told the AP. Police say Floyd matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at the convenience store.It was unclear why Floyd was arrested in such a physical way for what would have been a low-level crime. Police in most large cities have backed away from certain arrests to guard against further spread of the virus. The officers in the video were not wearing masks.A Minneapolis Fire Department report shows that paramedics moved Floyd from the scene, and two fire crew members got into the ambulance to help. Medics were doing chest compressions and other lifesaving measures on an “unresponsive, pulseless male,” the report said. Floyd was pronounced dead at a hospital.An autopsy will be performed to determine if the neck compression led to his death.News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record.In calling for charges, the mayor contrasted Floyd’s death with others involving police that turned on split-second decisions by officers.“We are not talking about a split-second decision that was made incorrectly,” Frey said. “There’s somewhere around 300 seconds in those five minutes — every one of which that officer could have turned back, every second of which he could have removed his knee from George Floyd’s neck.”___Long reported from Washington.

He also ordered priority testing for anyone in the above group displaying Covid-19 symptoms.Reviewing the coronavirus containment measures, Nitish asked health department officials to ensure that the second leg of the intensive door-to-door screening exercise ring fenced the ‘vulnerable’ categories from the infection through proper identification and testing protocols.For Coronavirus Live Updates“In view of the increase in the number of Covid-19 positive cases, immediate measures for augmenting the required health facilities, including adequate isolation wards and beds, should be initiated to ensure that there is no difficulty in their treatment,” Nitish said, while urging people to reach out for healthcare support as soon as they notice any symptoms.Insisting on the need for a massive awareness drive to involve the people in the fight against the disease, the chief minister asked for roping in elected representatives of panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies.“The idea is to impress upon the masses that the use of face masks, observance of social distancing norms, following government guidelines and testing were the four key tools in fighting the pandemic,” the chief minister said.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“Preventive steps are the key to staying safe. But if someone displays symptoms, he should immediately come forward for Covid-19 test and get treated in the event of a positive report, without wasting any time. All those staying at home quarantine, too, should follow the same approach. This is necessary to keep your family and neigbourhood safe,” he said.As a large number of migrant workers, including Covid-19 patients, are returning home after serving the mandatory quarantine period and or successful treatment, the chief minister appealed that they should not be subjected to any form of social stigmatisation.He also directed officials to expand the free distribution of face masks and soaps in the rural pockets to include poor families, rickshaw pullers, daily wage earners, street vendors and other needy persons living in urban areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-shifts-focus-on-the-vulnerable-in-2nd-phase-of-door-to-door-screening/story-UWMqkzSsBYjHcp50LMeixK.html
02-06-2020||India||Enforcement Directorate files chargesheet against P Chidambaram, son Karti in INX Media case||The Enforcement Directorate has filed charges against former finance minister P Chidambaram and son Karti in the INX Media case, people familiar with the development said. The charge-sheet was filed in special judge Ajay Kumar’s court on Tuesday.The ED, a federal agency that investigates financial crimes and money laundering, has accused the 74-year-old veteran Congress politician and Karti of being beneficial owners of shell firms incorporated in India and abroad that received bribes.There has been no statement from the ED detailing provisions of the money laundering law that the two Congress leaders that have been invoked in the charge-sheet. But the Enforcement Directorate has alleged in the past that nearly Rs 3 crore had been paid to Karti Chidambaram’s companies by INX Media co-founder, Peter Mukerjea. This money was allegedly paid at the behest of the senior Congress politician who was the finance minister when approvals to receive foreign investments were granted to INX Media.P Chidambaram was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in October last year when he was in Tihar jail. The arrest came around the same time that his bail application in a related case filed by the CBI was coming up for hearing. The Rajya Sabha MP was eventually released in December 2019 after spending nearly 105 days in Tihar jail.The former Union minister and his son have repeatedly denied the allegations.Also Read: ‘P Chidambaram, Karti met Mukerjeas, officials buried violations’: CBI in INX charge sheetAsked about the charge-sheet filed by the Enforcement Directorate, Karti Chidabaram declined to say anything. “I will not comment until something is served to me formally,” he said.The ED and CBI cases are linked to grant of Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance to INX Media to receive overseas funds to the tune of Rs 307 crore in 2007, when the Congress politician was finance minister in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government.Investigators have alleged that when Peter Mukerjea and wife Indrani met Chidambaram to get the foreign investment approvals, the minister told them to keep his son’s business interests in mind. At earlier court hearings, the ED has claimed that they had been able to identify payments of “Rs 3.09 crore by Peter Mukerjea to ASCPL (Advantage Strategic Consultancy Pvt Ltd) and associated entities controlled by Karti P Chidambaram through manipulated debit notes.”“During investigation, it was admitted that debit notes were raised on the directions of Karti Chidambaram to show some transaction which in fact did not occur,” the agency had alleged. It said the money so received by associated entities was channelled back into ASCPL.“The funds received by ASCPL were invested and ASCPL also purchased shares of Vasan Health Care. A part of these shares was sold at a profit of nearly Rs 41 crore. ASCPL also earned Rs.18.49 crore from sale of shares in another company for an amount of Rs 29.49 crore. These funds arising from sale of laundered property is also property involved in money laundering,” it has claimed.The agency had, in February 2019, attached properties worth Rs 54 crore allegedly belonging to Karti in Spain, the UK and India.Indrani Mukherjea, in her statement to CBI, has claimed that US dollars 5 million and US dollars 4,50,000 were transferred in overseas account of Congress leader in 2007 and 2009 respectively after getting money from INX’s foreign investors while a cash payment of Rs 1 crore was made to Karti in Delhi in 2009.

02-06-2020||India||31 Covid-19 cases outside quarantine centres in Odisha trigger concerns of community transmission||For the first time since migrant workers started arriving in Odisha on May 1, the state on Tuesday reported 31 cases of local infections triggering apprehension among experts that community transmission may have set in.The health and family welfare department said 146 Covid-19 cases were reported on Tuesday across the State taking the total to 2,245. Over 95 per cent of the total cases in Odisha have been reported from quarantine centres housing 115 migrant workers, several of whom have carried the disease from outside, however, 31 cases reported today were locals without any travel history.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThis is the first time that such a large number of locals have tested positive since May 1- when the migrant workers started arriving in Odisha after the lockdown norms were eased. Since May 5, when the returning migrant workers started testing positive in a large number, the number of infections among locals has been limited to anything between 2 and 10 and on some days no local tested positive. The Odisha government, too, has been indicating that there was no need to worry since the bulk of the cases were confined to quarantine centres through a successful execution of government strategy.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19But with 31 local infections on Tuesday, epidemiologist Binod Patra of AIIMS Bhubaneswar said it was not a good sign. “Community infection may not have happened right now, but 31 local infections on a single day shows local infections have begun. Despite the official claim that the infection is under control as migrant workers are being quarantined, it may not be happening on the ground as many of the returning workers seem to be infecting locals by not obeying the guidelines. This would lead to an explosive situation this month and July,” he warned.On Monday, Odisha announced stricter guidelines for 11 districts, including the six coastal districts that now account for 80 per cent of the total cases, ordering complete shutdown on Saturdays and Sundays. Though the order has been opposed by people all across the state, chief secretary Asit Tripathy said it was essential as cases will peak in Odisha in June and thus the next 3 weeks are crucial. As per the government, the shutdown was necessary to reduce social contact in 11 districts where most of the migrant workers have arrived.However, virologist T Jacob John of CMC Vellore said there was no doubt that community transmission had started in Odisha.“Community transmission happened the day migrant workers started arriving in Odisha in large numbers as there were media reports of many of them jumping quarantine centres and trains. Community transmission is occurring in Gujarat, Chennai, Maharashtra and Delhi since March. As 80 per cent of the infected people are asymptomatic, how would the government know that community transmission has not happened,” he asked.The virologist said Odisha’s 4,000 tests a day was not enough to rule out community transmission as the state was only testing symptomatic people in quarantine centres. “The government needs to test more people outside the quarantine centre and do more contact tracing to find out the extent of spread. But there is no doubt that community transmission has started in Odisha like other States,” he said.But Dr Jayant Panda, technical advisor to the health department on Covid-19 matters denied the possibility of any community transmission in Odisha despite 31 local infections being reported. “The 31 cases that we found today were from the high risk contacts of the positive cases in the quarantine centres. So far there is no community transmission. As advised by the ICMR, we would do Sero tests among people to see whether community transmission has happened,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/31-covid-19-cases-outside-quarantine-centres-in-odisha-trigger-concerns/story-Wh5mcX0W02NfYu0vDTI54L.html
02-06-2020||India||Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar takes on Mamata Banerjee’s govt over universities||A day after appointing Professor Goutam Chandra as pro-Vice Chancellor of Burdwan University West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar locked horns with the Mamata Banerjee administration yet again on Tuesday over the way state-run state universities are functioning.While in December 2019, the Bengal government had introduced a rule asking state-run universities to route all their communications with the governor through the higher education department, Dhankhar on Tuesday issued an order setting aside the six-month old rule.“Such communications are not required to be routed through any authority. Several vice chancellors have routed communications through the higher education department quoting provisions of the 2019 rules. Such a stance betrays lack of appreciation that no rule can override a provision of the Act,” the Governor’s order said.The governor by virtue of his position is the chancellor of all state-run universities. On Monday, Dhankhar appointed Professor Goutam Chandra as the pro vice-chancellor of Burdwan University without consulting the state administration. State education minister Partha Chatterjee called the governor a ‘BJP man’.“This is very unfortunate. We sent him our choice, but he appointed a person not on the list. He always wanted to appoint people loyal to the BJP. This is not done. We will not accept him in that position. The governor should have remembered that the government pays his salaries,” said Chatterjee.Ever since he assumed office on July 30, 2019, Dhankhar has been at loggerheads with the ruling Trinamool Congress TMC on a host of issues. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee once called him “an agent” of the Centre.In December 2019 the higher education department issued a gazette notification that abolished the chancellor’s secretariat, reduced the chancellor’s role in choosing vice-chancellors, took away his power to convene meetings of the highest bodies of the universities or take action against vice-chancellors.The Bharatiya Janata Party lashed out at the TMC for changing the protocol and accused it of neither abiding by tradition nor the Constitution.“Will they not abide by any tradition? Will they not follow what’s in the Constitution? It is the governor’s right,” said Rahul Sinha, national secretary of the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/governor-jadgeep-dhankhar-takes-on-mamata-banerjee-s-govt-over-universities/story-bc2NdjLIO7EtBY71Wfx6uN.html
02-06-2020||India||How five states in India are leading economy to recovery from lockdown||Five Indian states contributing nearly 27% of the country’s gross domestic product are leading a recovery in the economy as it slowly emerges from the world’s biggest lockdown, a study by Elara Securities Inc. shows.Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Haryana and Karnataka have seen a pickup in activity, based on an analysis of indicators such as power consumption, traffic movement, arrival of farm products at wholesale markets and Google mobility data, Garima Kapoor, an economist at Elara Securities in Mumbai, wrote in a note.Some of the most industrialized states such as Maharashtra and Gujarat were trailing because of tough measures still in place to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, she said.India will begin a phased lifting of the nationwide lockdown from June 8, allowing shopping malls, restaurants and places of worship to reopen in areas where virus infections are under control.“The best stimulus India can have is resumption of normal economic activity,” Kapoor said. “The country is witnessing an improvement in activity but it remains sporadic.”Punjab and Haryana were among states that saw an improvement in electricity requirement, reflecting demand from farm operations, the study showed. National capital Delhi also showed an increase in power demand as well as mobility trends.Kapoor examined Google search trends to see if consumers are shifting consumption patterns as they adapt to a “new way of life.”The analysis showed there was pent-up demand for salon services, air conditioners, air travel, bikes, vacuum cleaners and washing machines. Searches associated with panic-buying when the lockdown was first announced -- such as pharmacy and grocery stores and liquid soaps -- have eased. Consumers haven’t given up looking for items such as earphones, hair oil, laptops, mobile phones, jewelery, mops, toys and microwave ovens.“We anticipate demand to persist in the upcoming months, as some are virus-related shifts in patterns,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-five-states-in-india-are-leading-economy-to-recovery-from-lockdown/story-TMqx6WJ5q7LBqxxZKOKURO.html

Officials said that out of the new cases, 40 were from Jammu division and 77 from Kashmir division.Among the positive cases was Kashmir’s leading pulmonologist who was heading the fight against Covid-19 in a prominent government hospital.The doctor took to Twitter to announce that he had tested positive and that he followed protocol and got admitted. He also requested the administration to prepare a scientific SOP for duties and testing of all frontline workers to safeguard all.An official statement from the government informed that two persons also died.“Two Covid-19 deaths have been reported from Kashmir division,” the statement said.One of the deceased was an elderly woman from Baramulla, who had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and died on Monday. She tested positive on Tuesday.Another was a 27-year-old man, the youngest victim of the disease in the union territory.“A 27-year-old male from Lolab, Kupwara was admitted in SMHS Hospital Srinagar on Monday with bilateral pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and died within an hour of admission. He tested positive for SARS CoV-2 (Covid) today,” said nodal officer Covid-19, Dr Salim Khan.The two casualties took the death toll in the union territory to 33 out of which 29 are from Kashmir division and four are from the Jammu division.Fresh cases were reported in eight districts of Kashmir valley, taking the tally in the division to 2,076.The highest jump in Kashmir was in Srinagar with 15 new cases, while Pulwama recorded 14 new cases followed by Kulgam and Kupwara with 11 and 10 cases respectively.

02-06-2020||India||Tirumala temple opens on June 8, devotees told to keep 6ft distance||The famous temple of Lord Venkateshwara on Tirumala hills in Andhra Pradesh’s Chittoor district will be thrown open for devotees from June 8, after a gap of over two months.The order to this effect was issued by special chief secretary (endowments) JSV Prasad on Tuesday to Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), which manages the country’s richest temple.However, initially, the opening of Tirumala temple would only be for a trial run for a few days to test the implementation of physical distancing norms to contain spread of Covid-19.“During the trial run, only TTD employees and local people of Tirumala would be allowed to have darshan of the Lord. Only a limited number of people would be allowed at a time, duly maintaining a physical distance of 6 feet between persons at all times and all points,” Prasad said.The TTD will take a call on resumption of darshan of Lord for all the other pilgrims after assessing the situation during the trial run.The Tirumala was shut on March 19. This is for the first time in the history of the temple that it was closed for darshan for such a long period.The endowments department is yet to take a decision on opening of other temples. However, last month, the department suggested a series of measures to be followed in all major temples in the state which had been closed since March 20, prior to the imposition of nationwide lockdown.According to the instructions issued by the department to the temple authorities, devotees intending to have darshan of the deity should book the time slot for the same in advance. The time slot allotments would be made a day in advance and communicated to the devotees by way of text messages to their mobiles.The devotees have to produce Aadhaar card as an ID proof at the time of coming for darshan as per the time slot allotted to them. The darshans would be provided only from 6 am to 6 pm. “On an average, not more than 250 devotees would be allowed per hour for darshan,” the circular said.Unlike in the past, devotees cannot enter into inner circles of the temple (Antaralaya darshanams) or sanctum sanctorum (Garbhalaya darshanams) at least for the time being. They would also not be blessed with Satari (a replica of Lord’s feet to be placed on the head of devotee) or offered Teertham (Holy water) as minimum physical distance has to be maintained for the safety of Archakas (priests).The temple authorities have also been asked to ensure adequate safety measures in the temples so as to avoid spread of virus. Every temple should plan installation of disinfectant tunnels wherever feasible so that devotees can pass through them before entering the temple.They should also have facilities for the devotees to wash their feet and with soaps, besides sanitisers with stands at all entry points. All devotees should invariably wear face masks which should be readily available in sufficient numbers for sale in the nearby shops.The temple authorities shall workout methods for maintaining minimum physical distance of 6 ft between two devotees at any given point of time. They shall also examine the feasibility of arranging queue lines with alternative materials like queue makers (like in airports), instead of metal railings.In order to mobilise financial resources, the endowments department has also asked the temple authorities to increase online subscriptions for in-absentia pujas (Paroksha Seva) in their respective temples and give publicity for such worship.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tirumala-temple-opens-on-june-8-devotees-told-to-keep-6ft-distance/story-FLBNHEKyi5m2QNA78kcAoJ.html

This includes 52 deaths, 2,339 active cases and 1,403 patients who have been discharged after being cured.Of the new cases on Tuesday, all but 20 patients were people who had returned to Karnataka from Maharashtra, the worst-affected state in the country.The maximum -150 cases - were reported from Udupi district where a large number of people, working in the hotel industry in Mumbai, have come back in the last few weeks.Kalburgi, Yadigiri, Mandya, Hassan and Bangalore are the other districts that account for the bulk of the active cases in Karnataka.A health department official who did not want to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to the media, claimed that the state had done relatively well compared to other major counterparts across the country. “There is no organic transmission at a large scale happening here. The spurt is primarily because of people who have returned from Maharashtra. If we were to bar everybody coming from that state alone, we would have seen hardly 20 cases today.”The state government has made it compulsory for anybody coming from Maharashtra to undergo one week of institutional quarantine, a requirement which is not there for travellers from any other part of the country.The record spurt in cases came on a day when Karnataka’s health and family welfare minister B Sriramulu found himself at the centre of a controversy for reportedly flouting social distancing norms at an event in Chitradurga district.In a video, the minister was seen mobbed by hundreds of supporters and party workers, taken in a procession and garlanded while participating in a function to offer prayers to the Vedavati river in the district. Not everyone present was wearing a face mask or observing social distancing norms.The main opposition Congress has demanded the resignation of the minister and asked the Yediyurappa government to take action against him as per the law. However, the government was yet to react to the opposition charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-388-new-covid-19-positive-cases-karnataka-sees-biggest-single-day-spike/story-xrSUseVCdQ17zl1Moz0T9I.html

Both leaders have been votaries of reforms in the WHO but have chosen to take a vastly different approach. US President Donald Trump has threatened to exit the global health body to push the WHO to carry out the reforms. PM Modi, in contrast, has decided to push hard on reforms while staying as part of the WHO.Also Read: India is sensitive to China but won’t allow change in any border sector | AnalysisPM Modi also expressed concern regarding the ongoing civil disturbances in the US, conveyed his best wishes for an early resolution of the situation, a PMO statement said.“The phone conversation underscores that even in such an unsettled world and the changing dynamics in the post-Covid-19 pandemic, the relationship between India and the United States remains strong,” a top government functionary told Hindustan Times. The richness and depth of India-US consultations will remain an important pillar of the post-COVID global architecture.“The Indo-US relationship is at a historic high,” a second official said. He explained.“When was the last time that a prime minister of India spoke about civil disturbances in the US and expressed confidence that the US President would be able to handle it. Or when did the US President call the Indian Prime Minister during a serious border standoff. All this shows that both the leaders have taken the relationship to a very different level,” he said.Donald Trump had first given an indication of his intent to invite India to the G-7 on Saturday when he described the grouping of the seven countries - some of them among the most advanced economies of the world - as “outdated” and advocated rechristening it as “G-10 or G-11” to include India, Australia, South Korea and Russia.“We want Australia, we want India, we want South Korea. And what do we have? That’s a nice group of countries right there,” he had said, hinting that the heads of these nations could be invited for the next summit to be hosted by the US on a reschedule date in September or November.Prime Minister Modi commended President Trump for his creative and far-sighted approach, acknowledging that such an expanded forum would be in keeping with the emerging realities of the post-Covid world. PM Modi said that India would be happy to work with the US and other countries to ensure the success of the proposed Summit.The G-7 currently includes the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. India is a member of the larger version of the body that is called the G-20. However, according to an aide of the US President quoted by HT earlier, Trump’s plan seems to bring together important allies on a platform to deal with China, a country with which the United States’ relations have gone from bad to worse under the Trump administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-phone-call-to-pm-modi-us-president-donald-trump-invites-india-to-next-g-7-summit-in-usa/story-GZ3bRMQMQOwBOSLsg0i4fI.html

02-06-2020||India||MP Raj Bhawan delisted as containment zone in 5 days, Congress protests||The Madhya Pradesh Congress has alleged that the decision to denotify the containment zone at the Raj Bhawan campus, the official residence of the state governor, is tied to the cabinet expansion plan of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. The decision to place it under the containment zone was taken just five days ago.“The district administration in Bhopal denotified the containment zone at the Raj Bhavan campus on Monday evening, within five days of its notification, at the instance of the BJP government to facilitate expansion of Shivraj Singh Chouhan cabinet which is expected anytime,” said state Congress leader and MLA PC Sharma.Such decisions, the MLA said, corroborated their charge that the BJP government is not serious about the lives of people and is only focused on political gains.Notably, an official release from directorate of public relations ,on Monday night, stated, “Raj Bhavan has become containment free area. All the 10 persons infected with Covid-19 are under treatment in hospitals. Members of other 10 families of containment zone have been shifted to a quarantine centre.”After six Covid-19 patients were identified on the Raj Bhavan campus on Wednesday, the area around the patients’ houses was declared as a containment zone by the district administration.“The area covered under practical distance from these houses (10/0 to 10/9) which have been declared as epicentre, is being declared as a containment area,” read the district administration order rather than declaring the area within one kilometre radius as part of the containment zone.The order also said that the practical distance would be earmarked by the chief medical health officer (CMHO) and the RRT (rapid response team).“Containment area is defined as marking of first contact areas of the reported positive case,” said the order.The decision regarding the practical demarcation means that the main building on the campus, which is hardly 500 meters away from the employee quarters, is not covered under the containment zone. The area has been notified as containment zone free, said a district administration officer who did not wish to be named.Tarun Kumar Pithode, Collector of Bhopal, said, “I have not taken any such decision to declare the area (Raj Bhavan) as containment zone free area. I have got a proposal to the effect and am examining the same.”Manoharlal Dubey, secretary to the governor, said, “All I can say is as many as 11 families living in the zone have been shifted to some other place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-raj-bhawan-delisted-as-containment-zone-in-5-days-congress-protests/story-b6bNVyKyTSDTaq1bizMOrN.html

It will also touch Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Ludhiana in Punjab alongwith Kathua and Jammu in J&K.Dr Jitendra Singh, who is a Lok Sabha MP from Udhampur in Jammu division, has been pursuing this project since 2015 and about three and half years ago told the people in Katra that the proposal for the corridor has been accepted by Gadkari but it would take time to materialise because of procedural issues like survey, land acquisition, forest clearance etc.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesAccording to Dr Jitendra Singh, the survey has been completed and the process of acquisition of land is nearly complete in Haryana and will now be taken up in Punjab followed by the Jammu and Kashmir segment of the corridor.The formal approval of the proposal has been obtained from Punjab. Jammu and Kashmir had approved it earlier.Singh said after the completion of the corridor, people would prefer to travel between Jammu and Delhi by road instead of train or by air. The corridor has been planned to connect the two holy cities of Katra and Amritsar along with some other important religious shrines between the two destinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drive-from-delhi-to-katra-in-just-6-5-hours-by-2023-on-the-express-corridor-dr-jitendra-singh/story-cEPj9N5Et63XKIFyBQNWAP.html
02-06-2020||India||Odisha to alert 15 lakh farmers with text and voice messages about locusts||The Odisha government plans to send text messages to around 6.5 lakh farmers through WhatsApp and voice message to nearly 8 lakh farmers of western Odisha districts for spreading awareness on a possible locust invasion from neighbouring Chhattisgarh.Director of Agriculture and Food Production M Muthukumar told reporters on Tuesday that on a WhatsApp group, the farmers would be advised to form groups and make noise by beating utensils, tin boxes to drive away insects. The farmers are also being asked to take preventive measures like spraying neem seed kernel extract or neem-based insecticide on standing crops, he said.“The locust swarms have returned to Madhya Pradesh due to wind direction from Chhattisgarh after reaching Koria district of Chhattisgarh yesterday. However, there is a possibility of the swarm of locusts entering Odisha,” said the director.Chances of locust attack are high in Nabarangpur, Nuapada, Kalahandi, Malkangiri, Koraput, Rayagada, Jharsuguda, Sundargarh and Bargarh districts of the state. “The districts bordering Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have been asked to stay on high alert. We are keeping a watch on the movement of locusts for next 10 days even as the insects are yet to reach Odisha. If required, Fire Service personnel will be engaged for spraying insecticide for locust control,” he said.The director said Standard Operating Procedures have been formulated at district-level and block-level for irrigation officials to monitor the situation and submit a report stating the density of the locusts area-wise. Based on this report, action to control them will be taken. Also, a district-level monitoring committee and a state-level control room will be set-up.Pawan Kumar Agarwal, the Vice-Chancellor of the Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology said the government will use drones to spray insecticides in remote or difficult areas to kill locusts. The arrival of the locust swarm mainly depends on monsoon and the direction of the wind. Control rooms have been set up at state and district levels for locust control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-alert-15-lakh-farmers-with-text-and-voice-messages-about-locusts/story-P8L0UNl9enRHfhzXyNqFuM.html
02-06-2020||India||Supreme Court mulls allowing physical hearings after lawyers complain||Nearly 95 per cent of the lawyers are not comfortable with virtual court hearings, the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA) told Chief Justice of India (CJI), SA Bobde on Tuesday. The body of lawyers said that video hearings posed a major deterrent to present cases effectively. The SCAORA, body of lawyers eligible to file cases in the Supreme Court, urged the CJI to commence physical court hearings at the Supreme Court from July.“Most lawyers (almost 95%) are not comfortable with the virtual court hearings. The common feedback seems to be that the lawyers are unable to present their cases effectively in the virtual medium and the same is acting as a major deterrent for lawyers to consent for such virtual hearings,” the SCAORA said in a letter addressed to the CJI through its president, Shivaji M Jadhav.The court, after receiving such requests from various quarters, agreed to consider the feasibility of allowing physical appearance of advocates while adhering to social distancing norms. A notice to that effect was issued on Tuesday evening.All the advocates involved in a case should give their consent for physical hearing for a case to be listed in open court, the notice said.“Only on receipt of consent of all the parties to that effect, the matter will be considered for listing before the hon’ble court, subject to availability of the bench”, the notice issued by the court stated.The apex court started hearing cases through video conferencing on March 23, a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the nationwide lockdown in view of the coronavirus pandemic.The top court also issued a circular on March 23, suspending entry of lawyers and litigants to the court premises. It said only extremely urgent cases will be taken up for hearing through video conferencing during the lockdown period.The hearing in the top court is conducted through ‘Vidyo app’, which can be downloaded on mobile phones and computers. The platform is hosted on the servers of the National Data Centre of National Informatics Centre. While the judges on the bench join the video conference from the residence of one of the judges, the lawyers join from their respective houses.“In matters involving several parties and appearances by many lawyers, not all lawyers are given a chance to speak and sometimes their mics are put on mute by the coordinator as a result of which their matters get heard in their absence. There are problems with audio and video quality of hearings, which results in the lawyers not being able to effectively put forth their arguments,” SCAORA said in its letter.The SCAORA, while acknowledging the work done by the court during the lockdown period, pointed out that many lawyers are not well equipped with knowledge of the use of computers and are, hence, unable to participate in the hearings effectively.“Many a time, when a Senior Advocate or arguing Counsel appears, he/she is left to appear on their own. The AOR/briefing lawyer is unable to assist them effectively in this virtual medium,” the letter added.The bar body also highlighted the difficulties faced by lawyers due to staggered working of courts for the past 3 months. The number of cases which are being heard by courts, including the Supreme Court, reduced drastically after video conference hearings were introduced.From March 23 to May 1, the Supreme Court heard 835 cases. On a normal working day when physical hearings used to happen, the court used to hear 800 cases in a single day.“Several lawyers have expressed their concern over to the Executive Committee of SCAORA over the loss of livelihood during the past few months. Unless the normal functioning of Courts is resumed, the said concern will not abate,” Jadhav said in the letter.The SCAORA, therefore, requested the CJI to go back to physical court hearings from July when the court reopens after the summer break. The court is expected to shut on June 19 and go on a summer break till the first week of July.“I, on behalf of SCAORA and thousands of lawyers, request the court to resume physical Court hearings upon re-opening in July 2020 after summer vacations. More so, in light of the announcement of the Unlock 1.0 and measures to be undertaken to resume normalcy in a phased manner,” Jadhav said.Justice DY Chandrachud, Supreme Court judge and chairperson of the e-committee of the court, had said on May 24 that virtual court hearings will not replace or be a substitute to physical courts“I want to dissuade people from the idea that virtual court hearings are some sort of a panacea. They will not be able to replace physical court hearings. We had to resort to virtual court hearings because Covid-19 descended without warning and we had no other choice. We had to protect those who come to court: lawyers, litigants, media personnel, para-legal, interns,” he said at a webinar organised by Nyaya Forum of National Academy of Legal Studies and Research, Hyderabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-mulls-allowing-physical-hearings-after-lawyers-complain/story-VdkMjiMFo20a3prTK9XTQI.html
02-06-2020||India||Covid-19: Bihar stops registration of migrants for quarantine||Patna: Bihar government on Tuesday announced that it would stop registration of migrant workers, who have returned to their home state amid the easing of nationwide lockdown restrictions that were imposed on March 25 to stop the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, to be lodged in quarantine centres.The new norms have come into effect from Monday evening. Now, migrants returning to Bihar are not required to undergo the mandatory 14-day stay at the quarantine centres set up by the state government to prevent the spread of the pandemic.Earlier, the state government had announced the closure of these quarantine centres from June 15, as the inmates would have completed their 14-day isolation period by then.The state disaster management department’s (DMD) data until Monday showed that 1,424,548 people were registered in 11,124 quarantine centres across the state. So far, the state government authorities have discharged 948,900 people and 475,648 are yet to complete their mandatory 14-day quarantine period at these centres. Around 28 lakh people have returned to Bihar either by road or via Shramik Special trains since the easing of lockdown restrictions.Pratyaya Amrit, principal secretary, DMD, explained the state government’s decision to close down these quarantine centres from June 15. “The last batch of migrants reached Bihar on Monday. Hence, the quarantine period for all the migrant returnees will end by June 15,” Amrit said.Be that as it may, on Tuesday, too, 24,750 people arrived in the state by 15 Shramik Special trains, while another six trains are expected to ferry around 9,900 on Wednesday.Amrit, however, doesn’t want to consider the recent returnees as migrants.“How do you know they’re migrants? Inter-state travel restrictions have been lifted, and people are free to arrive in Bihar by any mode of conveyance from any part of the country,” he said.He argued that the quarantine facility was introduced during lockdown restrictions or when they were partially eased.“There is no need for fresh registration for migrants, as restrictions on inter-state movement have been lifted across the country,” he added.Amrit, however, made it clear that door-to-door health monitoring would continue, as part of the state government’s bid to ramp up surveillance to prevent the spread of the viral outbreak.Most of the makeshift quarantine centres across the state are operating out of schools, which need to be vacated, as the authorities are looking at reopening them. An announcement is likely to be made in July regarding the reopening of schools after assessing the ground reality about the pandemic, the authorities said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-bihar-stops-registration-of-migrants-for-quarantine/story-1Dv52KWGm3Ws1X2P5dlT7J.html

However, later on Tuesday the weather agency said that Nisarga is likely to make a landfall in Alibagh, near Mumbai on the afternoon of June 3.Though this has come as a major relief for people living in the coastal areas of Gujarat, but the cyclonic storm will have an impact in the form of gusty winds coupled with heavy rainfall in these areas, state MeT centre director Jayanta Sarkar said.The district administrations of Navsari as well as Valsad have already have started the evacuation process as a precautionary measure. Nearly 20,000 people from 47 villages located close to the coastline in these districts are being evacuated to safer place, news agency PTI reported on Tuesday quoting state officials.Valsad collector RR Rawal told PTI that nearly 10,000 people from 35 coastal villages are being shifted. “We have already identified shelter homes and started the evacuation process,” he added.The Navsari administration also has begun the evacuation process.“As per the alert issued by India Meteorological Department, there is a possibility that Cyclone Nisarga may hit Navsari area tonight or by morning of June 4; all required measures have been taken,” Navsari district collector Ardra Agarwal told news agency ANI.Besides this, the National Disaster Response Force, NDRF, has deployed 16 teams in the state. NDRF director-general SN Pradhan said that most of the teams have been deployed in coastal areas.(With inputs from PTI and ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-braces-for-cyclone-nisarga-thousands-evacuated-from-coastal-areas/story-jajQk8qgb5YQC2qWXgdBXP.html
02-06-2020||India||MP minister’s praise for private hospitals’ role in Covid-19 fight upsets govt health professionals||Madhya Pradesh government’s applause for state’s private hospitals’ contribution in the fight against Covid-19 has not gone down well with the public health professionals, who claim, it has undermined their efforts, sacrifice and challenges.On Monday, health minister Narottam Mishra attended a function organised by Chirayu Medical College, Bhopal, to mark the recovery of about 1,000 Covid patients at the facility.Mishra showered praises on the medical college chairman Dr Ajay Goenka who he said had rendered “a yeoman service” to people of Bhopal and added, that “Chirayu hospital has become no. 1 in the country to send back a 1,000 patients home after successful treatment.”In the health bulletin released on Monday night, Mishra’s department suggested that the total number of patients discharged from hospitals in Bhopal till date stood at 963. As per health department officials, these 963 patients out of the total 1,515 registered in Bhopal, include 125 patients discharged from AIIMS, Bhopal, about 50 from Hamidia Hospital, 43 from Homoeopathy Medical College and two from a private hospital.Bhopal has registered the second highest number of deaths in the state- 59-- after Indore, which has witnessed 135 deaths as per the health department bulletin. Of the 59 deaths in the city, 38 were reported from Hamidia hospital, 11 from AIIMS, Bhopal and remaining from Chirayu. Ujjain has the third highest number of deaths at 58.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe function at Chirayu Hospital, Bhopal was followed by advertisement by Sri Aurobindo Institute of Medical Sciences, Indore on Tuesday, claiming to be only such hospital in the country that has discharged more than 1,600 Covid patients. Notably, the medical college also highlighted a Tweet post of health minister Narottam Mishra, which read, “Congratulations to Aurobindo Medical college for remarkable achievements in the field of plasma therapy. This has come as a new ray of hope for treatment of Covid-19.”Medical fraternity associated with the public health system reacted to the private medical colleges’ claims and the state government’s support to them with disappointment.“We expect of the government to highlight the achievements of the public health system too. The government doctors and other health department personnel have risked their lives during survey, screening, collection of samples, test and treatment,” said Dr Devendra Goswami, president of MP Medical Officers Association, Madhya Pradesh.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Dr Jyoti Bindal, dean of MGM Medical College, Indore said, “Since more patients were admitted to private medical colleges, the number of recoveries is on the higher side. We are also doing well and there is good recovery (rate) of patients in our medical college also.”Dr Pravin Jadia, ex-chief medical and health officer of Indore, agreed with Dr Bindal.“Both government and private facilities are giving same medical treatment as per WHO guidelines, but since government hospitals have limited number of beds in comparison to private medical colleges, the number of patients discharged from private facilities is on the higher side,” he said. A health department official, who didn’t want to be named, said, “The government must understand that going gaga over private medical colleges’ claims without knowing the number of serious patients and asymptomatic ones will adversely affect the morale of the government doctors and the para medical staff.”Public health expert Amulya Nidhi said, “It’s unfortunate that instead of focusing on strengthening the public health system and boosting the morale of its own doctors and para-medical staff, the government is sending out a message that public healthcare system is unable to control the situation and treat the patients.”Dr Parag Sharma, spokesperson for Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal said there was a reason for more Covid-19 deaths at Hamidia.“Hamidia and AIIMS, Bhopal have been receiving such patients who fall under severe acute respiratory syndrome, right from day one, when many hospitals didn’t accept patients with respiratory illness. But, still the death rate of such patients in Hamidia has been about 20% as against 25% to 30% at the global level,” Dr Sharma said.A health department official, who was not willing to be named, said, “Only health minister can comment on the government affairs.”The health minister did not respond to phone calls and text messages.However, state BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai said, “Praising private facilities doesn’t mean criticising the public health system. From our Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to every citizen in the country, all have appreciated the efforts by our doctors and para medical staff for doing their best.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-minister-s-praise-for-private-hospitals-role-in-coved-19-fight-upsets-govt-health-professionals/story-gmNQm28mQLLIeqQlqQFXYP.html

This was communicated to defence minister Rajnath Singh by his French counterpart Florence Parly during a phone call on Tuesday. “France reaffirmed its commitment to ensure timely delivery of Rafale aircraft despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic,” the defence ministry said in a statement after the two ministers spoke.The IAF is likely to get the delivery of the first batch of four Rafale jets from France by July-end. The four fighters were supposed to fly to their home base in India in May 2020, but the plan was delayed due to the Covid-19 outbreak.Confinement measures announced by France to battle the outbreak had temporarily halted production at aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation’s Merignac facility.India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 as an emergency purchase to arrest the worrying slide in the air force’s combat capabilities.According to the delivery schedule, the first 18 jets (including the four in the first batch) are supposed to be delivered to the IAF by February 2021, with the rest expected by April-May 2022.France handed over to India its first Rafale fighter during a ceremony attended by Singh and Parly in Merignac on October 8, 2019, which coincided with the IAF’s 87th founding day and the Hindu festival of Dussehra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/france-says-will-deliver-rafale-on-time-despite-covid-19/story-LsSZpWc9vLD1KJsHiuSCaL.html

He replaced former MP Vikram Usendi.This will be the former Central leader’s third stint as the state president of the BJP. Sai, elected as Member of Parliament from Raigarh four times (1999-2014), served as Union minister in the first Narendra Modi’s government. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, he was not fielded by the BJP, as the party in Chhattisgarh had decided to not repeat any of its sitting MPs after losing the state assembly elections in 2018.The new BJP chief is viewed as an influential tribal leader, particularly in the plains of Chhattisgarh. Sources within the party say that there was consensus around his name because of his influence among the tribals and his extensive track record in the state.Meanwhile, Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel congratulated Sai for his appointment as the BJP state chief. छत्तीसगढ़ के मुख्य विपक्षी दल भारतीय जनता पार्टी के प्रदेश अध्यक्ष के रूप में चुने जाने पर मैं पूर्व केंद्रीय मंत्री एवं छत्तीसगढ़ भाजपा के नेता @vishnudsai जी को बधाई देता हूँ।आशा करता हूँ कि आपके नेतृत्व में छत्तीसगढ़ भाजपा सकारात्मक विपक्ष की भूमिका निभाए।“ …..

The blowout at Baghjan occurred at 10.30 am on May 27, while work was underway to produce gas from a new oil and gas reservoir at a depth of 3,729 metres.“The operation to contain the blowout requires a large amount of water and lot of heavy machinery. Therefore, it will take several days to put everything in place before the actual effort to control the well can start,” OIL spokesperson Tridiv Hazarika said.A water reservoir is being dug near the well to place two 2,500-gallon pumps and a pipeline is being laid from a nearby river to ensure continuous supply of water. OIL and Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) personnel are pumping water to the well to minimise the chances of a fire.“It has been assessed that approach to the vicinity of the well would not be safe due to gas gushing at high pressure. Hence, necessary equipment is being mobilised and fit-for-purpose equipment is being fabricated at OIL workshop,” OIL said in a statement on Tuesday.Help from several foreign firms is being sought to contain the blowout. OIL said on Tuesday experts from Singapore-based Alert Disaster Control could reach the site in the next few days.A retired senior OIL executive, who declined to be named, said: “The process to control a blowout requires lot of heavy equipment, which will have to be brought from other parts of the country, as well as services of global experts in dealing with such situations. In 2005, it took more than a month to bring things under control. This time could it could take longer.”Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal dialled Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan for the second time in a week on Tuesday and sought foreign experts to plug the natural gas flow at Baghjan well.Sonowal also sought adequate compensation for families affected by the blowout. His office said an expert team from Singapore would reach Assam on Wednesday to lend its expertise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/blowout-in-assam-gas-well-may-take-a-few-weeks-before-it-s-under-control/story-5VTfE1F2IFmCdUqHgJnonM.html

The DMs will coordinate with them and provide them funds on the requirement basis”, said Mainali, a Nainital-based advocate.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.Advocate Shiv Bhatt, counsel of Sachdanand Dabral had said on May 27 that the HC had sought a report on the condition of quarantine centres in four districts - Nainital, Udham Singh Nagar, Haridwar and Dehradun - with a high Covid-19 numbers after a PIL alleged they were in pathetic condition and lacked basic facilities.The court had directed secretaries of the District Legal Services Authorities of Nainital, Udham Singh Nagar, Haridwar and Dehradun to visit quarantine centers and submit a report to the court Mainali, petitioner in one of the PILs, said the District Legal Services Authorities of these four districts submitted their report to the HC, pointing out the pathetic condition and lack of basic facilities in quarantine centres in rural areas of these districts. The report highlighted poor conditions of sanitation, toilet facilities and food provided in the quarantine centres, he said.Mainali said the HC also directed the state government that it should address the findings of the report submitted by the District Legal Services Authorities and come up with suggestions. “For this, the secretary health department has been asked to submit a report within two weeks”, he said.On earlier directions of the HC regarding conducting rapid tests, Mainali said the state government apprised the court that 11,000 rapid test kits have been procured by it and so far 2,100 rapid tests have been conducted. “The HC directed the state government to submit state-wide details regarding rapid test kits distributed and tests conducted across the state within two weeks”, he said.On May 20, the HC had directed the state government to procure rapid test kits immediately and start testing on an experimental basis at the border points. It had said “although rapid antibody test has not been approved by ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which is the nodal agency spearheading the fight against Cocid-19 pandemic in the country) for diagnostic purposes, but since the result of this test is available in much less time, such tests can be used for surveillance purposes alone.

02-06-2020||India||198 migrant workers killed in road accidents during lockdown: Report||One hundred and ninety eight migrant workers lost their lives in road accidents during the lockdown period, according to data compiled by the SaveLIFE Foundation, a road safety NGO.There were at least 1,461 accidents over the course of the nationwide lockdown - from March 25 to May 31 - in which at least 750 people were killed, including 198 migrant workers. There were 1,390 who got injured, according to the data. Migrant workers, killed during their efforts to go back home, comprise 26.4% of the overall deaths during the lockdown whereas essential workers comprise 5.3% of the total deaths. The overall deaths involving other other road users stands at 68.3 percent.The report contributes fatigue among bus and truck drivers, hired to transport migrants, combined with over speeding and poor engineering of roads as the top reason for deaths. Out of the reported deaths, Uttar Pradesh accounted for over 30% (245) of the total deaths followed by Telangana (56), Madhya Pradesh (56), Bihar (43), Punjab (38) and Maharashtra (36).The top five states that reported road crash deaths of migrant workers are Uttar Pradesh (94), Madhya Pradesh (38), Bihar (16), Telangana (11) and Maharashtra (9).To be clear, the report says that the data has been compiled using media-tracking and multi-source verification.Further analysis reveals that around 27% of the victims were migrant workers whereas 5% were essential workers like police, doctors, and others. About 68% of the overall deaths involved pedestrians, two-wheelers and three-wheelers – categorised as Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs).“Since the lockdown began, nearly 200 migrant workers have lost their lives while walking, cycling back home, traveling in HMVs and LMV commercial vehicles, and in mass fatality crashes involving state-organised buses. One of the recurring reasons for mass casualties in most of the incidents was speeding and driver fatigue due to continuous driving on tenuous routes,” the report said.Out of the four phases of lockdown, phase four was the deadliest overall in terms of road deaths with 322 deaths (43%) and phase three was the deadliest in particular for migrant workers. Phase three reported 60% of all migrant deaths in road crashes during lockdown followed by phase four with 19% of total migrant deaths reported in the media. “With Covid-19 still very much around, we simply can’t afford to burden our already overburdened healthcare system with road crash related trauma. The data collated by us suggests that there has been a surge in road crashes with lifting of the restrictions across the states in Phase 3 and Phase 4. It is critical that states enhance enforcement to prevent road crashes and the citizens inculcate essential safety habits for the road like they did for personal hygiene during the lockdown,” said Piyush Tewari, Founder and CEO, SaveLIFE Foundation.According to the report, vehicle-on-vehicle collisions constituted the highest crash configuration with 43% of all road crash deaths. In 15% cases, speeding was highlighted as a factor, though it is likely that speeding was involved in most fatal crashes though not highlighted in the media reports tracked, it said. Pedestrian rundowns constituted 9% of the total death toll.The union home minister had issued several communications to states to ensure that migrant workers do not have to walk back to their home states. On May 15, union home secretary Ajay Bhalla wrote to states instructing them to urge migrants to take the Shramik Special trains, which are currently in operation.“In case they are found in such conditions, they should be taken to nearby shelters, appropriately counseled and provided food and water till such time they are facilitated to board the Shramik Special trains or buses to their native places,” Bhalla had said, adding that incidents of migrants walking back to their homes were still being reported from across the country.So far, more than 56 lakh migrants have been sent back home in Shramik Special trains, according to the ministry of railways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/198-migrant-workers-killed-in-road-accidents-during-lockdown-report/story-hTWzAWMYn0kyycKw1dyKqL.html

The fatal second bite occurred when she was undergoing treatment for the first bite by a viper at her husband’s home two months ago. Later, police did a post-mortem on the carcass of the black cobra that had bit the deceased to collect scientific evidences.After her death, Uthra’s parents alleged that it was a well-planned murder and her in-laws and sister (in- law) were aware of the crime. During questioning, Sooraj reportedly told the police that his parents also knew about the plot and they hid her ornaments. The police then recovered 37 sovereigns of gold on Monday which was buried in two packets. Uthra’s parents alleged that a major portion of the gold gifted as dowry was missing.Crime branch deputy superintendent A Ashokan said all three, Sooraj’s parents and sister, will be booked for domestic violence, anti-dowry provisions, abetment to crime and destroying evidences. Earlier, the state women’s commission had also directed the police to book them. The case surfaced after Uthra’s parents filed a complaint a week after her death. They alleged that Sooraj and his family members often harassed her for dowry. The couple had got married two years ago and has a one-year-old son. Her father said that he had gifted over 100 sovereigns of gold, a new car and Rs 10 lakh cash to appease her ever- demanding in-laws.Later, probe revealed that Sooraj had bought a cobra from a snake handler for Rs 10,000. On May 6, he reportedly took the snake to Uthra’s paternal house in Anchal, where she was undergoing treatment for the first snake bite. The police said after Uthra fell asleep, Sooraj allegedly took out the snake from the bottle and threw it on her. Later, he also said Uthra was sedated by lacing sleeping pills in her food.Also Read: Kerala woman’s death after second snake bite turns out to be a murderHe told pgolice he kept awake all night to ensure that he could escape unscathed. He left the room in the morning and started reading a newspaper in the verandah as if nothing happened. Soon, Uthra’s mother found her daughter lying unconscious in the bed. She was rushed to a hospital, where doctors said she died of a snake bite. Later, the cobra was found from Uthra’s room and killed.Expert snake handler Vava Suresh, who has rescued more than 500 king cobras and many other snakes, said the accused might have taken training in snake handling and might have inflicted pain on the reptile to provoke it to bite. The post-mortem revealed that Uthra was bitten twice by the cobra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-snake-bite-murder-three-more-arrested-hidden-gold-ornaments-dug-out/story-STR75oMUJfRKuR6JNPu50I.html

Lack of support to the poor and the MSME sector means the worst is yet to come,” he tweeted.Downgrading India’s rating by a notch to ‘Baa3’ from ‘Baa2’ assigned in November 2018, Moody’s on Monday estimated India’s GDP would shrink by 4% -- the first full fiscal contraction in more than four decades.Addressing a virtual news conference, Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar questioned the Central government’s intention of helping farmers, saying Modi’s aim of doubling their income by 2022 will remain a “pipe dream” if they don’t get the promised minimum support price (MSP) for their produce.He said a majority of farm produce is purchased in the open market at rates much lower than the MSP declared by the government.“The government’s intention is doubtful. If it wants to help farmers, give them the due price for their produce,” he said.Jakhar urged the prime minister to make MSP a “legally binding right” of farmers to ensure they get right and remunerative prices for their produce.The government on Monday raised MSP of paddy by a marginal Rs 53 a quintal to Rs 1,868 a quintal for 2020-21, while the rates for oilseeds, pulses and cereals were hiked substantially.Jakhar charged the government with “betraying” farmers for not coming out with the CACP (Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices) report on fixing MSPs of different crops.Except for wheat and paddy, a majority of crops is sold at prices much below MSP as agencies do not buy them at government rates, he said.“The farmers lose out in the bargain. The prime minister wants to revive the economy, but what has the farmer got in his Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package?” asked the Punjab Congress chief.Instead of giving any cash benefits to farmers, he said the Centre advised them to take more credit. “Farmers are already reeling under debt and are committing suicides,” Jakhar said, urging the prime minister to grant fiscal incentives to farmers and waive off their loans.Jakhar said the exodus of migrant workers to their home states will further impact the country’s Coronavirus-hit economy.The input cost of farmers has risen during the pandemic, as labour is not easily available because migrant workers have left for their homes, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/moody-s-rated-modi-s-handling-of-economy-a-step-above-junk-rahul-gandhi/story-L8ogdYm4CaY6GOEDB3Uu1M.html

A police team immediately reached the spot but agitated villagers in Bhujaini clashed with them and set afire two vehicles. Ambika Prasad Patel was tied to a tree on Monday night allegedly by Harishankar, Shubham, Ram Milan and others, who set him on fire, Superintendent of Police Abhishek Singh said. Harishankar and Shubham have been arrested, and an FIR was registered, police said, adding that the situation was under control now. Harishankar had lodged an FIR against Patel on March 1 for allegedly harassing his daughter and posting an objectionable photo of her on social media. Police suspect this to be the cause behind the killing. Patel was arrested at that time and also sent to jail. An FIR was lodged against Patel under sections 67 (publishing or transmitting obscene material) of the Information Technology Act, and 354 (outraging the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-tied-to-tree-burnt-alive-for-harassing-girl/story-Mum4IxJszeXd0UAxL0HOZO.html
02-06-2020||India||Adesh Kumar Gupta replaces Manoj Tiwari as Delhi BJP chief||New Delhi: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda on Tuesday appointed Adesh Kumar Gupta, a councillor from West Patel Nagar, as the new chief of its Delhi unit over three months after the saffron party got a drubbing from the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the assembly elections.Gupta will replace Bhojpuri actor-turned-politician and a Member of Parliament (MP) from north-east Delhi, Manoj Tiwari, who held the post for three-and-a-half years.Gupta (51), who started his political career with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, has risen through the ranks in the party and was elected the mayor of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation in 2018. He held various posts in the BJP’s Delhi unit, including the office secretary in 2012.Political analysts are of the opinion that Gupta’s appointment is a part of the BJP strategy to woo baniyas, or traders, and Punjabis, its core support base, in the national capital.The BJP appointed Tiwari, who had joined the party just before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, as its Delhi unit chief in December 2016 in a bid to woo the Purvanchal community, those who hail from eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and a significant vote bank in state politics.His elevation was also predicated to Delhi elections that were held in February, where the BJP performed disastrously and managed to win only eight of the 70 seats. Initially, Tiwari’s ascent in Delhi BJP had benefitted the party, as it not only won the municipal elections in 2017 for the third consecutive term, despite huge anti-incumbency, but also bettered its score in several seats.The party had projected Tiwari as its Purvanchali face to galvanise the support of the community. The BJP won all seven seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections under Tiwari’s leadership. But the humiliating defeat in Delhi polls put paid to his rising career graph. “This is a routine appointment, which was due for long. The appointment couldn’t be done earlier due to elections in Delhi, followed by riots and then the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak,” said a senior BJP leader.“The decision to appoint a baniya shows that the party wants to keep its core support base intact. Besides, the next elections in Delhi are of the civic bodies that are still two years away. Gupta will be able to win civic polls for the party,” he added.This is not the first time that the BJP has appointed a councillor as its Delhi chief. In 2014, the BJP had appointed Satish Upadhyay, a one-time councillor from Malviya Nagar in south Delhi, as its state unit chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adesh-kumar-gupta-replaces-manoj-tiwari-as-delhi-bjp-chief/story-pTmrGnYQ4G8VwrKpCEADcK.html

02-06-2020||India||Govt says India’s ranking as 7th worst affected nation misleading, it’s faring better than the rest||The Union health ministry on Tuesday claimed that it was wrong to judge the success of India’s coronavirus containment efforts by the number of positive cases-- 198,706—alone, which has led to the country climbing up the charts of the worst-affected countries to reach the 7th spot overall and stated that a balanced view could only be obtained by comparing data from a clutch of worst-affected countries with a combined population similar to India’s.“If we look at 14 countries with a combined population similar to India then we find that they even today, they have reported 22.5% more positive cases and 55.2 times more deaths,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry. The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Agarwal also said that India’s recovery and fatality rates are much better than the world average. “The fatality rate in our country is 2.82%, one of the lowest—compared to the world average of 6.13%,” he said, before adding that even the figure of case fatality per lakh population in India is 0.41 compared to the world average of 4.9.Pushing the argument that India had shown better disease management, agarwal said that India’s fatalities were concentrated among patients of a particular age group and with pre-existing health conditions. Covid-19 outbreaks may be seasonal, scientists sayOne in every two Coved-19 deaths in India has been from the senior citizen population, who constitute 10% of our total population. 73% of India’s Covid-19 fatalities are cases of co-morbiities such as diabetes, hypertension, heart and respiratory diseases,” he said.He listed several focus areas in the containment effort which were behind this relative success.“Early case identification, clinical management, surveillance, contact tracing; these efforts has helped us improve our fatality rate to 2.82%,” said Lav Agarwal. India’s Covid-19 tally was just a little over 37,000 a month ago and has jumped more than five times. The number of deaths has also climbed—1,218 people were reported dead on May 2. According to the latest data, 95,526 people have been cured which translates into 48.07% recovery rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-says-india-s-ranking-as-7th-worst-affected-nation-misleading-it-s-faring-better-than-the-rest/story-gS9j3LThTMr4uQwQcKxX9I.html

02-06-2020||India||Rajasthan explores feasibility of creating manufacturing hubs along highways||The Rajasthan government is exploring the possibility of establishing manufacturing hubs along highways in the state to bring in investment and create jobs, a senior official of the industry department has said.Under the proposal, the state is looking at designating areas along highways as manufacturing hubs. These projects would be on the lines of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor and Bharatmala, which focus on developing economic corridors, the official said on condition of anonymity.The state government has asked the task force of the industry department to study the possibility of declaring land on both the sides of state and national highways as manufacturing zones and easing the process of conversion of land, the official said.Referring to the benefits of such hubs, the official said: “Along the highways, there are generally no residential areas. The transportation cost of raw materials will be low, and warehouses will be close as they usually are located along highways.”As a pilot, the state has started some projects, such as the upcoming oil refinery in Barmer, and a petroleum chemicals and petrochemicals investment region (PCPIR) being developed along the Jodhpur-Barmer highway. A detailed project report has also been prepared.The official said two locations had been identified by the Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment Corporation (RIICO) for PCRIP –Borawas Kalawa (where land has been acquired to develop an industrial area) and Ram Nagar Thob (where land has been identified).“Two major express highways – Delhi-Vadodara and Jamnagar Amritsar – cross Rajasthan. Now, industrial development is mostly near highways and railways. The state is looking for land banks close to highways as it is all about connectivity,” the official said.Besides PCPIR, the state has developed and sold clusters for sports goods and toys at Khuskheda in Bhiwadi, which will benefit domestic business.Similarly, gas grids are being established in Rajasthan so that raw materials going from the state to Gujarat for making ceramic goods, in the absence of a gas grid, will be utilised here. The state has identified two locations for gas grids and six firms have shown interest.CII Rajasthan chairman Vishal Baid said the National Highways Authority of India accomplished the figure for the highest ever highway construction of 3,979 km in fiscal 2020.“We should take advantage of this widespread facility and establish industrial manufacturing hubs alongside these national highways, which will provide easy access to transport raw material and finished goods to various places, with minimum traffic congestion. It will save fuel and lead time and also decrease pollution levels in cities due to the movement of heavy vehicles,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-explores-feasibility-of-creating-manufacturing-hubs-along-highways/story-rwchTTSi8m0OP2WxU4t2CL.html

An alert has been sounded in Mumbai, its suburban districts, Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts in view of the cyclonic storm. According to the Met department, there is a possibility of extremely heavy rain in these districts on June 3 and 4 under the impact of the cyclone. Along with Maharashtra and Gujarat governments, agencies like the NDRF and the NDMA, the armed forces have also geared up to deal assist in the relief and rescue operations.To that end, Indian Navy’s Western Naval Command has mobilised adequate resources for flood relief, rescue and diving assistance in the event of excessive rainfall and flooding of both urban and rural areas in coordination with the respective state governments on the Western seaboard. According to a press release, In Mumbai, the Navy will be on standby with five Flood Rescue Teams and three Diving Teams throughout the monsoon season. These teams are stationed at various naval areas across the city to enable early response over a larger area. These teams are fully equipped and have been trained for rescue operations.

02-06-2020||India||Jessica Lal’s murderer Manu Sharma walks out of Tihar jail||Manu Sharma, who was serving a life term after being convicted of the murder of model Jessica Lal in 1999, was released from Tihar jail on Monday evening after lieutenant governor (LG) Anil Baijal accepted the recommendations of the Sentence Review Board (SRB). “The lieutenant governor had accepted the recommendations of the SRB meeting held on May 11,” Sharma’s lawyer Amit Sahni said.Any convict -- barring one found guilty of heinous crimes such as rape and murder, murder and robbery, murder in cases of terrorism and murder while out on parole -- who has completed 14 years in prison without remission is eligible for early release.Watch | Manu Sharma, who killed Jessica Lal in 1999, released from Delhi’s Tihar jail The prison’s director general Sandeep Goel confirmed Sharma was released on Monday. Siddharth Vashishta, 43, better known by his alias Manu Sharma, shot dead model Jessica Lal, who was tending an unlicensed bar at a private party on April 30, 1999, after she refused to serve him a drink well past midnight. He is the son of Haryana politician Venod Sharma.In November 2019, Sahni approached the Delhi high court seeking Sharma’s release. In his plea, he said that despite spending 23 years in jail (with remission added), and a record of good conduct in prison, the SRB denied his client’s release on four separate occasions in an “unfair and unlawful manner.”Remission is when a prisoner displays good conduct in prison, and his/her sentence is reduced. While Sharma has served around 16 years of actual sentencing, he has completed 23 years with remission.The Delhi high court had then asked the board to consider Sharma’s case for release in its next meeting, which took place on May 11. The board consists of the state home minister, who is its chairman, and the prison’s director-general, state home secretary, state law secretary, a district judge, the government’s chief probationary officer and a joint commissioner-rank officer of the Delhi Police.Last month Lal’s sister Sabrina had said that she had forgiven Sharma and that he had served his time for the crime. Sabrina had also said that it was time for her to move on. “ My fight was always for justice. We got justice. If he is released. I have no problem.” Sharma’s acquittal by a city court in February 2006 triggered protests across the country, after which the Delhi high court took up the case. The high court reversed the order, saying the lower court ignored or misread material evidence. Sharma was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in December 2006. The Supreme Court upheld the order in 2010.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jessica-lal-s-murderer-manu-sharma-walks-out-of-tihar-jail/story-vqmiGQ58U8jZzaJte1Q68H.html

The lifting of a ban on inter-state movement on May 4 is believed to be the prime factor for the jump in cases.The first case in the region was detected on March 24, when a 23-year-old woman who returned from the UK tested positive in Manipur. On May 5, the figure for the entire region was just 103 cases. The total population of the region is more than 45 million.On May 5, Assam had 44 positive cases, one death, 32 recoveries and 11 people under treatment. Four weeks later, on June 1, the state’s tally stood at 1,486 cases, four deaths, 285 recoveries and 1,194 people under treatment. The total cases included 1,337 people who had returned to state since May 4.“The surge in positive cases is because of the homecoming of our residents from other states. Nearly 800 of the new cases are those of people who returned from Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Delhi,” Assam’s health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Sunday.Tripura recorded its biggest one-day spike on Monday, when 107 people tested positive, taking the state’s tally to 421 cases. Of the total, 166 were Border Security Force (BSF) personnel from two battalions based in the state and their family members. On May 5, the state had just 42 cases.On Tuesday morning, Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga Tweeted about 12 new cases in the state, including 10 people who had returned from Delhi and two from Kolkata.The state had recorded just one case prior to this, of a 50-year-old pastor who was found positive on March 24 and recovered by May 9.Nagaland recorded six new cases on Tuesday morning, taking the state’s total to 49. The state’s first Covid-19 cases were detected on May 25, when three people who returned on a Shramik Special train from Chennai tested positive.Meghalaya had 13 Covid-19 cases till May 5, all of them connected to a family in the state capital Shillong in the East Khasi Hills. Two weeks later, a person who returned from Chennai tested positive in the Garo Hills, the first Covid-19 patient in the region. The state’s tally now stands at 28.With both its first two positive cases recovering, Manipur didn’t have an active Covid-19 case as of May 5. But the status changed 10 days later, with the detection of an infection. The state now has 83 cases with 11 recoveries and no deaths.Arunachal Pradesh was Covid-19 free as of May 5, with the lone patient in the state recovering the previous month. But with the return of the state’s residents from other parts of the country, the figures started increasing. On Monday, the state recorded 16 new cases, taking its tally to 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-just-assam-other-ne-states-witness-spike-in-covid-19-cases-as-people-return-to-region/story-ZRrmFswaKhrLBsbeGAgalJ.html

Muneer Raqib, Jammu and Kashmir’s secretary for art, culture and language, said the local academy for art, culture and languages started the trend and he hoped this would be replicated across the country. “We have organised six full-fledged mushairas, sessions for songs, skits and magic shows, and plan to have similar activities in the near future,” he said.The academy started with online sessions of songs in different languages, and poets then requested that online mushairas be arranged. This was done along with several cultural organisations of Kashmir, he said.“From the past one year, the academy had plans to switch over to online and virtual sessions to reach a larger audience, especially among youngsters. The Covid-19 gave us an opportunity. We have asked people to use our facilities or help to reach their target audience,” Raqib said.Two days ago, one of the oldest cultural organisations in Jammu and Kashmir, the Rafiabad Adbi Markaz, joined hands with the Academy of Art, Culture and Languages for a long online poetic symposium that was joined by more than 17 poets.Mohammad Ashraf Tak, chief editor of the academy, said local literary organisations played a key role in making the online platform a great success at a time when such activities have been curtailed by the Covid-19 crisis. “This is just the beginning and more programmes and projects are in the offing,” he said.The verses and compositions of some of the poets and writers were inspired by the Coronavirus and its deadly impact on day-to-day activities. “These online sessions have attracted good audiences and people have liked this very much. For us, it is lockdown literature. We have done two so far and it’s just the beginning,” said Rafiq Masoodi, who served as secretary of the academy for several years.Many poets are now regularly uploading their latest poems in English, Urdu, Hindi and Kashmiri on social media and some have written long verses on the pandemic as they try to give the people hope that it won’t last long.However, Tajamul, one of the participants in an online mushaira, said: “It’s not easy to conduct a mushaira on 2G connection, and despite the slow internet speed, we completed it. For us, this mushaira was an act of resilience.”Authorities snapped internet connectivity across Kashmir after the erstwhile state’s special status was scrapped last August. Recently, 2G connectivity was restored in the region but there have been numerous complaints about the slow speeds.Athar Bashir, a young poet well versed with social media, said the Covid-19 lockdown has given a fillip to poets to write about recent happenings.“Through social media, we can share our literary creations to a cross-section of society and it’s encouraging when they reach a large audience, especially among the younger generation who are hooked to social media. Also, it helps us to maintain social distancing and poets are not at risk of being infected by the Coronavirus,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-s-poets-take-mushairas-online-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-tt88y8tJUGPCvw0T9JK3kK.html

Now, the forest department has been entrusted with the responsibility to coordinate with the tribal affairs department in the implementation of the Act,” said Rakesh Chaturvedi, principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF), Chhattisgarh.The tribal rights activists have welcomed the state government’s revised order.Alok Shukla, convener, Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan, a pressure group, said the state government’s revised order upholds the basic spirit of the Act and respects democratic values.Earlier last Saturday, the state government had also issued a press release. “Community members will be given community forest rights for the conservation of forests. Forest dwellers will be allowed to manage the proper use of trees. The state forest department has been made the nodal department as far as community forest resource rights under the Act is concerned,” the release had said.However, Section 11 of the Act clearly states that the Union Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal agency for the implementation of all provisions of the legislation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-govt-revises-order-in-which-forest-dept-was-made-nodal-agency-for-implementing-fra/story-zgKpjGtYckn66LY6QzlFZK.html

Prime Minister Modi announced a special relief package of Rs 1,000 crore for Bengal and Rs 500 crore for Odisha after conducting an aerial survey of affected areas in both states. Now that another approaches, he has extended his prayers for the well being of people in the region that may come in the path of the cyclone that first turned into a deep depression into the Arabian Sea and then into a storm before it was assessed to gather enough power to turn into a severe cyclonic storm in the next 24 hours.Also Read: Cyclone Nisarga: Landfall expected over Raigad district on Wednesday afternoon“Praying for everyone’s well-being.

But what matters is that people understand the message. Many people have uninstalled Chinese apps. So when crores uninstall apps. It will be a message for the Chinese government when they are intruding into India,” Wangchuk said.He insisted the people’s “wallet power” could be an ideal supplement for the army’s capabilities to safeguard our borders in Ladakh. “It is not only the army which will give a fitting reply to the Chinese but the people are also with the army and they will respond with their wallets,” he said.Wangchuk said that boycott is a powerful weapon that could make China realise that antagonizing India could prove to be a costly affair.“When traders will start cancelling orders from China it will send a powerful message to Chinese government that antagonising India will extract a huge price. The government will be apprehensive that the Chinese population may turn against it because trade is the only support for the people of that country who otherwise are like bonded labour. So if their income from trade is disturbed there could be a possibility of a revolt. It is imperative to ensure that the boycott of Chinese products is successful. I hope the conduct of Indians can become an example for the rest of the world to follow,” said the engineer-turned-education reformer who inspired Aamir Khan’s character in the Bollywood blockbuster 3 Idiots.India’s trade deficit with China is massive at $56.77 billion. The bilateral trade between India and China was $93 billion last year after it fell by about $3 billion as both countries experienced economic slowdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/boycott-will-make-china-pay-heavily-for-provoking-india-sonam-wangchuk/story-nKgktimhHmq6m8H4C5XU6M.html

02-06-2020||India||Cyclone Nisarga: How was the cyclonic storm set to hit Maharashtra, Gujarat named||The deep depression in the Arabian Sea intensified into a cyclonic storm, which has been officially named as Cyclone Nisarga by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), around 12pm on Tuesday, officials said.Cyclone Nisarga, headed towards the coastline of Maharashtra and Gujarat, comes a week after Cyclone Amphan wreaked havoc in West Bengal. Nisarga, which is currently brewing in the Arabian Sea, means nature and was named by Bangladesh. The name was accorded in a list formulated by a group of countries.Bangladesh had also suggested ‘Fani’, which had made a landfall in Odisha on May 3, 2019, and the extremely severe cyclone had caused extensive damage in the eastern state.Tropical cyclones are named to help the scientific community and disaster managers to identify cyclones, create awareness and effectively disseminate warnings to wider audiences.The naming of cyclones in the Indian Ocean began in 2000 and a formula was agreed in 2004.The World Meteorological Organisation and the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific had, at its 27th session held in 2000, agreed to assign names to the tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand were part of the panel. Later in 2018 Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Yemen were added to the list.Cyclones around the world are named by Regional Specialised Meteorological Centres and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres. There are a total of six RSMCs and five TCWCs, including the India Meteorological Department.The Indian weather bureau has been mandated with the duty to name cyclones that develop over the North Indian ocean, including Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, by following a standard procedure.IMD released a list of cyclone names in April 2020 as suggested by the 13 countries. The names like Arnab, Nisarga, Aag, Vyom, Azar, Prabhanjan, Tej, Gati, Lulu among 160 other names were listed.The next few cyclones will be named Gati (named by India), Nivar (Iran), Burevi (Maldives), Tauktae (Myanmar) and Yaas (Oman).The new list included the last name from the previous list ‘Amphan’ as it remained unused at the time of release. After ‘Amphan’, ‘Nisarga’ name was picked up for the ensuing cyclone.IMD has said the names should be gender, politics, religion and culture neutral, not hurt sentiments, not be offensive, be short, easy to pronounce.Cyclone Nisarga is expected to make landfall very close to Alibag, 94km south of Mumbai, on the afternoon of June 3.“The landfall location will be very close to Alibag but extensive damage can be expected in Mumbai also,” Sunita Devi, in-charge of cyclones at IMD, said.Cyclone Nisarga is likely to cross north Maharashtra and adjoining south Gujarat coast between Harihareshwar (Maharashtra) and Daman during the afternoon of June 3.The storm surge is expected to be one to two metres above the astronomical tide and is very likely to inundate low-lying areas of Mumbai, Thane and Raigad districts at the time of landfall. It is also expected to be about 0.5 to one metre above the astronomical tide and likely to inundate low-lying areas of Ratnagiri district.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-nisarga-how-was-the-cyclonic-storm-set-to-hit-maharashtra-gujarat-named/story-yft0m40tmspjXc0qEHcSGN.html

Besides, 5.30 lakh migrants are still lodged in block and district level quarantine centres  “We have stopped the registration of migrants from Monday for putting them in 14-day institutional quarantine...Why will anyone (migrant) be registered and for what when restrictions on the movement of people have been lifted in the country. How do you know who is migrant because now anyone can come either by train, bus, car or any other mode?” Disaster Management Departments Principal Secretary Pratyaya Amrit told PTI.He said quarantine facilities were introduced when movement of people was either banned or restricted.During the lockdown, people had to obtain passes from the competent authorities to undertake travel from one place to another. But with the introduction of unlock 1, such requirement has been done away with, he said.He, however, asserted that door-to-door health monitoring will continue.The officer said quarantine centres will be closed after June 15 when the 14-day quarantine period of the last batch of registered migrants will end.“Why quarantine centres will remain open when there will be no one at these centres after the arrival of last batch which was supposed to reach Bihar by June 1? “We had written a letter to the official concerned to send the special (Shramik) train by June 1. If we take that into account, the quarantine period will come to an end on June 15,” he said.Schools also have to be vacated for starting academic activities, he said.So far, 28 to 29 lakh migrants have reached Bihar in its biggest ever evacuation exercise, he claimed.The state governments decision comes at a time when many migrants returning to Bihar have tested positive for Covid-19, leading to a massive surge in the number of cases.According to the data released by the state Health department, the number of migrants who have tested positive since May 3 is 2,743. Bihar had reported 3,872 cases and 23 deaths till Monday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-government-closes-migrants-registration-for-quarantine/story-yFq10wOTr9ted7ooubN17K.html
02-06-2020||India||‘Not random, aimed at self-reliant India’: PM Modi on policy announcements||The government’s policy announcements are not “random”, underscored Prime Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, adding that they will help create a self-reliant India that aims to cater to the world’s economy. The PM also put his faith in the country’s entrepreneurship for “definitely” getting the growth back.Addressing a conference on ‘Getting Growth Back’ organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) at its 125th anniversary, he said he would go beyond the theme to say, “Yes ! We will definitely get our growth back.”“Some of you may think in this time of crisis how could I say this with such confidence? There are many reasons for this confidence. I’ve confidence in India’s capabilities and crisis management. I’ve confidence in India’s talent and technology. I’ve confidence in India’s innovation and intellect. I’ve confidence in India’s farmers, MSMEs and entrepreneurs,” he said in Hindi through a virtual address.The Covid-19 pandemic has battered the global economy and India is not an exception. According to official data released on Friday, the Indian economy grew by 3.1% in the first three months this year and 4.2% in the financial year 2019-20. Prolonged nationwide lockdown is expected to dent the economy further in this financial year.The PM said Covid-19 has slowed India’s growth, but the biggest truth is that India has left behind the lockdown and has entered into the “un-lock phase one” and a major part of the economy has restarted.“Today we are able to do this because when Coronavirus was spreading globally, India took the right steps at the right time. When we compare ourselves with other countries, we come to know about the effectiveness of the lockdown in India,” he said.One of the “highest priorities” of the government, the PM added, is to strengthen the economy again. “For this, the government is taking decisions required to be taken immediately. And simultaneously, such decisions have also been taken that would help the country in the long run,” he said.Modi was referring to the Rs 20.97 lakh crore economic stimulus package announced between March 26 and May 17 that included free foodgrains and direct cash benefits to the poor, credit guarantee schemes for the industry, monetary measures by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and wide-ranging policy reforms.“The Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) helped in giving immediate relief to the poor. Under this scheme, ration has been provided to 74 crore beneficiaries. Free ration is also being supplied to the migrant labourers,” he said. The package helped the poor and 80 million of them got a free cooking gas cylinder under the scheme, he added. The PMGKY was the first response to Covid-19 that was announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on March 26.The entire package is a combination of providing relief to the underprivileged section of the society and restoration of the economy along with policy reforms, Modi said.“For us reform is not a random or scattered decision. For us, reform is a systematic, planned, integrated, inter-connected and futuristic process. For us, reform means dare to take decisions and take them to the logical conclusion,” he said.On the things necessary to take India on a higher growth trajectory, the PM spotlighted five things: intent, inclusion, investment, infrastructure and innovation. “You can get a glimpse of them also in the bold decisions taken recently,” he said.The PM was referring to the recent decision of giving full freedom to the farmer to sell produce without involving the middleman. He said that labour laws are being reformed to create more job opportunities and private sector participation has been allowed in strategic sectors such as space and nuclear energy.The path of growth is self-reliance and the world has great expectations from India, said Modi. “India has potential, strength and ability. “All of you should, India’s industry should take full advantage of the trust the world has for India,” he said.“Getting growth back is not that difficult. And, above all, Indian industries have a clear path, which is the path of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India),” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-random-aimed-at-self-reliant-india-pm-modi-on-policy-announcements/story-PiWDx3QCLA4BLfWci4hK5N.html

The dead workers have been identified as Rajesh and Arjaiah from Kamanpur village and Rakesh and Praveen of Godavarikhani—all in the age group of around 30 years who were working on contract in the coal mine. The bodies were shifted to Singareni Area Hospital at Godavarikhani for post-mortem.Ramagunda commissioner of police V Satyanarayana said while speaking to reporters that three other contract workers—Venkatesh from Kamanpur, Bheemaiah from Ratnapur and Shankar form Julapalli villages—received grievous injuries and were shifted to the same hospital for treatment.The accident happened in the open cast mine-I of Ramagundam Region-III of Singareni coal mines of Ramagiri mandal.Though it is not exactly known how the explosion took place in the mine, preliminary inquiries by the police revealed that explosive material used in coal mines to blast stones in the open cast mines went off accidentally.“The workers dig holes to coal stocks and blast them by fixing detonators in the holes. Later, the coal would be shifted to surface. The blast is learnt to have occurred while fixing detonators in the holes,” a police official from Ramagundam said.Peddapalli MP Venkatesh Netha, Ramagundam MLA Korukanti Chander, Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC) general secretary Janak Prasad and Bharatiya Janata Party Ramagundam district unit president Somarapu Satyanarayana called on the injured in the hospital.Leaders of the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC) demanded that the Singareni management should pay ex gratia of Rs 1 crore to each of the families of the deceased.“We also demand that all the three injured be paid a compensation of Rs 50 lakh each.

Video footage showed the officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he gasped for breath, sparking widespread protests across the US. “Floyd’s killing by police and the ‘Black lives matter’ agitation in the US have given a clear message to the world that a common man’s life has value and it should not be taken for granted,” Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi.“India’s constitution guarantees independence, security, self-respect and pride and governments should give special attention to it. If it was followed, crores of migrant labourers would not have to witness such bad days,” she added.She also demanded better coordination between states to check the spread of coronavirus and said the Centre should intervene.“While coronavirus patients are rising, there is lack of coordination between states and with the Centre, and allegation and counter allegations are going on and sealing of state borders is unjustified and it is weakening the fight against the virus.

02-06-2020||India||Chhattisgarh sees record intake of labourers under MGNREGS in last two months||Chhattisgarh ranks third after Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh as far as the intake of labourers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) is concerned because of the nationwide lockdown restrictions, which were imposed on March 25 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.“Chhattisgarh government has issued 39,55,163 job cards under MGNREGS. In the last two months 21,84,291, or 55% of the total job cards were issued because of the pandemic,” said Mazhar Khan, nodal officer, MGNREGS, Chhattisgarh.The percentage of job cards is calculated as per a financial year – from April 1 to March 31 – and in 2019 around 63% were issued by the state government.“We’re expecting that MGNREGS will generate up to 80% of rural employment in this financial year because of the pandemic,” Khan added.The state government authorities said the intake under MGNREGS has doubled in Chhattisgarh that has an estimated population of about 29 million. Data showed that the total number of registered rural households in Chhattisgarh is 41,22,882, of which 39,55,163, or about 96% have job cards. A registered household refers to a person from a family living in rural areas, who have applied to avail of the benefits under the MGNREGS and his application has been accepted by the secretary of a panchayat.The state government is yet to issue 167,779 job cards to MGNREGS aspirants.Dharmlal Kaushik, leader of opposition in Chhattisgarh assembly, has demanded that the state government must increase the mandatory workdays from 100 to 150 under the scheme, as several labourers have exhausted their 100-day quota and are facing joblessness because of the Covid-19-induced economic crisis.“Our data showed that 2,227 households have completed their 100 days of work,” Khan said.State panchayat minister Tribhuvaneshwar Saran Singh Deo has countered Kaushik’s suggestions. “I’ve already written to the Centre government, stating that the state government is willing to ensure an additional 50 days of works for those enrolled under the MGNREGS. However, we’d like to impress upon the Centre that it must mandatorily double the assured workdays from 100 to 200 because of the deepening economic crisis.”The minister did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation to arrive at the proposed increase in the number of the workdays under the scheme. “Usually, a calendar year has 365 days, of which 52 are either Sundays or a weekly off. At least three months account for monsoon, or another 100-odd days are lost. The rest of the days can be easily utilised for MGNREGS,” he said.Singh Deo urged the Centre to mandate more workdays under the scheme and also ensure prompt payment facilities. In normal circumstances, a labourer in Chhattisgarh clock around 36 workdays, even though the cap is on 100 days. “Now, this option should be doubled to 200 workdays to tide over the growing unemployment woes in rural areas,” he added.Singh Deo has instructed officials to create new job cards for migrant workers under MGNREGS, farm and allied sectors, water conservation and irrigation on a priority basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-sees-record-intake-of-labourers-under-mgnregs-in-last-two-months/story-VRUcwRco71t3JrPbIFQX3J.html

Citing lack of support to the poor and MSME sector, Gandhi has also issued a warning, saying that the worst is yet to come. “Moody’s has rated Modi’s handling of India’s economy a step above JUNK. Lack of support to the poor and the MSME sector means the worst is yet to come,” Gandhi said on Twitter.Moody's has rated Modi's handling of India's economy a step above JUNK.Lack of support to the poor and the MSME sector means the worst is yet to come.https://t.co/bOtH1P3pBZThe country’s credit rating by Moody’s was downgraded to Baa3 from Baa2, according to a statement. The outlook remained unchanged. “The decision to downgrade India’s ratings reflects Moody’s view that the country’s policymaking institutions will be challenged in enacting and implementing policies which effectively mitigate the risks of a sustained period of relatively low growth, significant further deterioration in the general government fiscal position and stress in the financial sector,” the ratings firm said on Monday.Moody, which last assigned a rating on India’s sovereign credit rating in November 2018, has also estimated a decrease in India’s GDP by 4 per cent. ‘Baa3’ rating is the lowest investment grade -- just a notch above ‘junk’ status. Moody’s had last downgraded India’s rating in 1998.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-s-handling-of-economy-a-step-above-junk-rahul-gandhi-on-moody-s-rating/story-5T2wj9ocnnkBL99LkfnAZM.html

Nisarga is expected to have a wind speed of 100 kmph to 110 kmph, with gusts of up to 120 kmph. “The landfall location will be very close to Alibag but extensive damage can be expected in Mumbai also,” said Sunita Devi, in-charge of cyclones at the India Meteorological Department (IMD).

He added, “If this happens over Mumbai during the high tide time on 3rd June morning—the rains and storm surge and the tide can work together to flood a city that is already clogged.

A 14-year-old student, a girl, allegedly committed suicide in Malappuram and her parents alleged that she was disturbed as she could not attend online classes since the family did not have either a TV or smartphone.The girl was missing from her house since Monday afternoon and her fully burnt body was later recovered from an isolated plot near her house in Valancherry. The police also recovered an empty bottle of kerosene near her body. The police said that after preliminary investigation, they found it to be a suicide and recovered a suicide note too. The body of the girl was later sent to post-mortem in Manjeri medical college hospital.School authorities say the Class 9 student was good in her studies. Her parents said though they had a small TV, it was under repair for last three months. The repair was delayed because the family head, a Dalit farm hand, was without work in last three months due to lockdown.“It was a sad incident. The government started virtual classes without preparations. There are at least 20,000 students in Malappuram and Wayanad districts alone who have no access to TV or smartphones. Big publicity to online classes pushed the deprived students to a corner,” said local legislator Abid Hussain Thangal who later visited the house of the deceased.State Education Minister C Raveendranath has sought a report from the district education officer. The virtual classes were inaugurated by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday and he said the new system will revolutionise the system.Many educational activists and others had warned the government to not rush with virtual classes as there are two lakh students who have no access to TV or smartphones. “We warned the government about this. The government should have done this after ensuring access to all students,” said educational activist Shajir Khan.Meanwhile, Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi has sought a list of families and others who have no access to TV and smartphones. In a letter to the district collector, Gandhi said that online classes pose significant challenges for students with limited access to smartphones, computers and reliable internet connections.Gandhi also said that he would like to extend his support and assistance in procurement of devices for students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-girl-allegedly-commits-suicide-for-missing-online-classes-mp-rahul-gandhi-offers-help/story-RbYEOiznZWZPfvELnEkGwI.html

That by far has kept politics aside during the time of the pandemic,” Thackeray, who is also Maharashtra’s minister for tourism, environment and protocol, told Hindustan Times in an interview.Aaditya Thackeray’s surprise praise for PM Modi and Amit Shah in an interview to Hindustan Times comes a week after a war of words broke out between Uddhav Thackeray and Railways Minister Piyush Goyal on Twitter over the Shramik Specials to ferry back migrant labourers that carried on past midnight.Also read: Amit Shah dials Uddhav Thackeray after Bandra protest sets off political firestormUddhav Thackeray was last month seen to be critical of the central government for allotting only half the 80 trains requested by the state for migrant workers, mostly from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, who wanted to go home.Piyush Goyal had promptly hit back, telling Maharashtra that he could arrange to send 125 trains for the stranded migrants provided the state makes sure that they do not run “empty”. Goyal also asked the state to send a list of stranded migrants who had to be accommodated in these trains and then fired a string of reminders on social media to drive home the point that it was the Shiv Sena-led coalition that was unprepared, not the railways.Asked about this back-and-forth between the Shiv Sena government and the central minister, Aaditya Thackeray appeared to suggest that some amount of friction was inevitable when different parties are in power at the Centre and the state.WATCH: Aaditya Thackeray on unlocking Maharashtra | On The Record“I feel that if you have two different parties or two different coalitions are ruling at the state and Centre, then there will always be those tussles,” the 29-year-old Thackeray said before going ahead to underscore that Uddhav Thackeray was in sync with PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. And this had helped in the fight against coronavirus disease.“I don’t think this is the right time for any minister to speak about any politics,” Thackeray said.The Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party have been bitter rivals after the Sena walked out of their alliance of 30 years over the chief minister’s chair. Uddhav Thackeray took over as chief minister in November last year in coalition with erstwhile rivals - Congress and the NCP - after a short spell of central rule.Also read: ‘Not the right time for any minister to speak about politics,’ says Aaditya ThackerayBut Uddhav Thackeray, whose party frequently criticises the BJP-led central government, rarely directs his attacks at PM Modi or Shah.When Uddhav Thackeray was staring at the possibility of missing the six-month deadline to become a member of the legislative council, Thackeray had sent an SOS to PM Modi for help. Within two days, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari wrote to the Election Commission to hold elections to the legislative council that eventually led to Thackeray being elected a member of the council unopposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-praise-for-pm-modi-aaditya-thackeray-delivers-a-message-to-ministers/story-ve8pKQEiF695t54Odf72mK.html

IMD issues red alert, low-lying areas to be evacuated||Nisarga, the deep depression that is currently moving northwards in the Arabian Sea, will hit the Maharashtra coast on Wednesday.The India Meteorological Department said in its weather outlook on Tuesday morning that Nisarga is expected to become a cyclonic storm on Monday morning and a severe cyclonic storm by 5.30 pm on June 2.It further said that Nisarga is moving at a speed of 11 kmph. “It lay centred over East-Central Arabian Sea about 280 km west-southwest of Panjim (Goa), 490 km south-southwest of Mumbai (Maharashtra) and 710 km south-southwest of Surat (Gujarat),” said the IMD.“It is very likely to move nearly northwards during next six hours and recurve north-northeastwards thereafter and cross north Maharashtra and adjoining south Gujarat coast between Harihareshwar (in Maharashtra’s Raigad) and Daman during the afternoon of June 3,” the IMD further said.The storm is currently packing in winds upto 90-100 kmph. The wind speed is expected to be 105-115 kmph gusting to 125 kmph when it nears landfall. Scientists said that Nisarga could inundate low-lying areas especially in cities like Mumbai and cause structural damage from falling trees and power poles. This has raised concern over how the city, already strained for healthcare resources on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, will cope.The weather department has advised fishermen to not venture into the southeast Arabian Sea, Lakshadweep area and along and off Kerala coast during next 48 hours.Alert has been sounded in Mumbai, its suburban districts, Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts in view of Nisarga. The IMD on Monday issued a red alert for these districts for June 3 and 4. A red alert - which indicates the possibility of extremely heavy rain of more than 204.5 mm - is a warning for residents to take action and keep safe from adverse impact. Both Maharashtra and Gujarat governments have ordered people living in low-lying areas on the coastal regions to be evacuated and shifted to safer places.With the formation of two cyclones - in the Bay of Bengal (Amphan) and Arabian Sea (Nisarga) - within two weeks of each other, scientists warn about the possibility of more pre-monsoon cyclonic storms in coming years due to warmer ocean temperatures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-dangerous-is-cyclone-nisarga-imd-issues-red-alert-low-lying-areas-to-be-evacuated/story-X2gyMvZXSmkJa4iHcYoc5L.html
02-06-2020||India||Copyright extends to theme, plot and storyline of literary works: Bombay High Court||Bombay High Court has held that in the case of literary artworks, copyright extends not only to the expression of the core idea but also to its theme, plot and the storyline.The order pronounced on Friday came on a plea filed by Urdu writer Shamoil Ahmad Khan who claimed that Falguni Shah and two others had infringed his copyright in one of his short stories, Singardan (Dressing Table), and produced a web series under the same title.It is being aired on an online platform, Ullu, and is also available on YouTube, Khan said. Khan claimed that producers of the web series had not only copied the title but also the entire plot, narrative and characters of his story.Producers of the web series opposed his plea for an injunction claiming that save and except the central idea of Singardaan, there was no other similarity between Khan’s work and the web series. They claimed that the central idea—a man taking away a dressing table from a brothel to his home during riots and its use leading to changes in the behaviour of the womenfolk at home—by itself was not entitled to any copyright protection.They submitted that the depiction of the central idea in the web series, including the pathos, texture, treatment, purport and presentation, was materially different from Khan’s story and therefore there was no question of infringement.The argument, however, failed to impress upon justice SC Gupte.The judge said it’s true that copyright does not extend to ideas, or schemes, or systems, or methods and it is confined to their expression, and if the expression is not copied the copyright is not infringed.Justice Gupte clarified that in a literary artwork a germ of an idea is developed into a theme and then into a plot and then the final story with the help of characters and settings. It is the combination of all these elements which give a substance to the work, he said.“If one goes on stripping the final work of these various elements, one may finally come to the bare idea or abstraction which no longer enjoys copyright protection.”Justice Gupte said when someone strips the story of Singardaan of its embellishments, the motivations and the tribulations of its characters and their actual actions, they get the plot and the storyline.“The above narration is the life and blood of the plaintiff’s (Khan’s) story,” said the judge. He added it cannot be said that the writer has copyright only in the details of expression and that those are embellishments - the details which have no essential bearing on the theme, plot and storyline of Khan’s work.“If someone steals this theme, plot and storyline, is he not thereby plagiarising the expression of the plaintiff’s work? Can the above theme, plot and storyline be simply dismissed as non-protectable ideas of the plaintiff’s work and not its expression? I think not. We have not yet reached that level of extraction where the work can be stripped to its non-protectable idea,” he said.The judge concluded that though the producers of the web series developed Khan’s theme, plot and storyline in a different manner, prima face it was a case of copyright infringement, and restrained them from making any further adaptation of Singardaan. The court also directed them to maintain accounts of the revenue earned from the web series, right from its inception till disposal of Khan’s suit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/copyright-extends-to-theme-plot-and-storyline-of-literary-works-bombay-high-court/story-nacCJnUag2BLmg68XMf4IN.html

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Nisarga is likely to make landfall between Harihareshwar in Maharashtra’s Raigad and Daman on June 3.The IMD has issued a red alert for six other districts - Palghar, Thane, Raigad, Dhule, Nandurbar and Nashik, between June 3 and 4.The development of NisargaA low pressure area and a depression are the first two levels used by the IMD to classify cyclones based on their intensity. The depression is likely to intensify and become furious and turn into a cyclonic storm in the wee hours of the morning on June 2 and then into a severe cyclonic storm by June 3.Nisarga’s pathThe deep depression is currently 550 kilometre south-southwest of Mumbai in Maharashtra and 800 km south-southwest of Surat in Gujarat. The depression is likely to move northwards till June 2 morning. It will then re-curve north-northeastwards and cross north Maharashtra and south Gujarat coasts during June 3 afternoon, which is when it is likely to make landfall.Wind speed accompanying NisargaWhen it becomes a severe cyclonic storm, Nisarga will be packing in a wind speed of 105-115 kmph, gusting to 125 kilometre per hour on June 3. According to the IMD, it again will weaken into a cyclonic storm with wind speed of 60-70, gusting to 80 kilometre per hour on June 4. Cyclone Amphan, which struck India’s eastern coast last month, was packing in winds upto 180 kmph. It had turned into a super cyclone (category 5 according to IMD) and made landfall ad extremely severe cyclonic storm.Cyclone’s impactThe coastal areas of Maharashtra and Gujarat may experience high speed winds and extremely heavy rainfall during this period. The fishermen have been advised not to venture in the sea. IMD’s cyclone track shows that Nisarga will cross very close to the Mumbai coast while entering the land.PreparationsThe Maharashtra government on Monday sounded an alert in Mumbai and neighbouring districts in view of the approaching cyclonic storm Nisarga. Ten units of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) have been deployed in vulnerable districts, while six others have been kept on a stand-by, officials said. Union Home Minister Amit Shah spoke to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray through video conference and took stock of the state’s preparedness to tackle any eventuality. Adequate precautions are being taken to safeguard chemical and atomic energy plants located in coastal Palghar and Raigad districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cycline-nisarga-expected-to-bring-100-kmph-winds-all-you-need-to-know/story-zYUtFQgNywgoABgnGcdCvJ.html
02-06-2020||India||Amid Covid-19 restrictions, Kashmir cherry farmers demand minimum support price||Fruit growers in Kashmir have demanded minimum support price (MSP) for cherry as despite the high yield this year farmers are facing massive losses due to limited demand amid the coronavirus pandemic.Kashmir Fruit Growers cum Dealers Union (KFGDU) has criticised the administration of Jammu and Kashmir for its “failure” in providing adequate air and railway facilities for transporting the fruit during the Covid-19 restrictions as well as disregarding their request to provide minimum support price to help farmers during the crisis.“The union has also suggested and made a humble request to the Lt Governor’s administration for consideration of minimum support prices of cherry at Rs 100/kg so that the poor cherry growers of the valley, who have constantly suffered heavy losses since 2014 devastating floods, may feel a sigh of relief but it is unfortunate that LG’s administration did not pay any attention to the said proposal,” Bashir Ahmad Basheer, KFGDU’s chairperson, said in a statement.Officials say the tentative figures showed the production of cherries in the Kashmir Valley this year is about 12,000 metric tonnes. Last year, the figure was around 11,700 metric tonnes.Kashmir exports some 3,500 to 4000 metric tonnes of cherries to other states every year.Despite the sizeable yield, farmers are a worried lot because of the lack of demand following the closure of markets and difficulties in transporting the cherries from farms to markets amid Covid-19-related restrictions. They are getting a price of Rs 45-50 per kg as against double the amount last year.Basheer said that owing to the apprehension of total damage of the cherry crop this year owing to the restrictions, the growers in the valley are staring at losses of crores of rupees with around 10 lakh families directly or indirectly connected with this industry.“In case, the preventive measures are not taken well in advance there is a threat of the fruit industry of the UT, which is the backbone of J&K’s economy, turning sick,” he said.Pandurang K Pole, the divisional commissioner of Kashmir, said there was no past precedent for such demand or its fulfilment. “Is there an example that such a thing has happened in the past which we could emulate?” he asked.He said they met the growers’ union and apprised them of what was possible and what was not.“Given the circumstances, the supply chain of every commodity is disrupted not just cherry. They know what is possible and not possible. Nevertheless, we are facilitating them,” he said.The union said that there was around Rs 150-200 crore turnover cherry annually of which 60% of the total comes from Makhmali and Mishri varieties which were traditionally sent to Mumbai markets.“As per past practice, these varieties are transported to Mumbai market through Air Cargo or by railways. Since Mumbai is extremely hit by Covid, the fruit mandi in Mumbai is therefore completely non-functional for any business,” he said.Kashmir produces four types of cherries—Awwal Number, Double, Mishri and Makhmali —with the last two sold to other states.“In this connection, the management of KFGDU took up the matter with LG administration and airlines for providing air and rail facilities for transportation of cherry to different stations of the country but despite vigorous follow-up, the governor’s admin failed to provide facilities causing acute mental agony to cherry growers,” the union president said.Pole said that the administration was facilitating the transport of the fruit to Delhi while Mumbai was a red zone.“Every day five to seven trucks are going to major markets of Delhi. Although 70% of the supply of cherry goes to Mumbai, but that is closed. There are no flights and the fruit is very perishable,” he said.The union also said the Canning Owners Association, which lift the Double Cherry variety of the fruit, are reluctant in view of the closure of canning factories and uncertainty of its marketing.Pole said they have given a go-ahead to 20 canning units to start functioning. “The units will be opening and some 4,000 metric tons will be used for canning,” he said.Cherries are grown on an estimated 2,713 hectares in Kashmir and over the years the production has increased. From 8,282 metric tonnes during 2016-17, the figure increased to 11,280 metric tonnes in 2017-18 and further to 11,789 metric tonnes in 2018-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-19-restrictions-kashmir-cherry-farmers-demand-minimum-support-price/story-LI0xqbeJ8vZFb72JR2RIwN.html
02-06-2020||India||India’s drug regulator grants Gilead Sciences marketing authorisation for remdesivir||India’s drug regulator has granted US pharma giant Gilead Sciences marketing authorisation for its anti-viral drug remdesivir for “restricted emergency use” on hospitalised Covid-19 patients in view of the crisis posed by the pandemic.The approval process for remdesivir was accelerated in view of the emergency situation and the unmet need for medicines in light of the coronavirus outbreak, a source in the know of the developments told PTI.The drug has been allowed for restricted emergency use for treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe symptoms, subject to several safeguards, the source said.“The drug, which is administered in the form of an injection, has been approved to be sold by retail on the prescription of specialists for use in hospital or institutional setup only,” the source told PTI.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“The approval process for remdesivir was accelerated by invoking special provisions under the New Drug and Clinical Trial Rules, 2019, which provides for waiver of clinical trials in special circumstances,” the source said.Gilead Sciences had on May 29 applied for marketing authorisation for remdesivir in India. The drug is being touted as a potential treatment for Covid-19.The approval was given following consultation with the subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO).“The drug is given in the form of an injection and that is why it has to be administered under the supervision of a doctor in a hospital setting,” the source said.Gilead Sciences, the patent holder of the drug, has the complete data about the pre-clinical and clinical studies for remdesivir, the source added.The medicine has been issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hospitalised coronavirus-infected patients.Meanwhile, the applications of two Indian pharmaceutical companies -- Cipla and Hetero Labs -- seeking permission to manufacture and sell remdesivir in India is still under consideration.Gilead Sciences Inc has entered into non-exclusive licensing agreements with pharma firms, including three domestic majors Cipla, Jubilant Life Sciences and Hetero, for manufacture and distribution of remdesivir.The Indian Council of Medical Research had earlier said anti-viral medication remdesivir, which was used during the Ebola outbreak, may inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 replication and research on its efficacy in the treatment of Covid-19 is a part of WHO’s ‘Solidarity Trial’.According to a recently published study in the New England Journal of Medicine, two out of three critically ill coronavirus patients who were on oxygen support showed signs of improvement when they were administered remdesivir.All new drugs have to undergo trials before getting approval for marketing them in India.But the New Drug and Clinical Trial Rules, 2019, provide for certain clauses, according to which the provision of waiver of local phase-III clinical trials of the drug is approved and marketed in certain countries (as notified from time to time) subject to certain conditions like national emergency or epidemics in public interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-drug-regulator-grants-gilead-sciences-marketing-authorisation-for-remdesivir/story-J3uUtC6afBNPR7Qb1RWEWL.html

Considered to be the worst-ever civil unrest in the US in decades, violent protests have engulfed at least 140 cities across the country in the days following the death of George Floyd, the 46-year-old African-American man who was pinned to the ground in Minneapolis on May 25 by a white police officer who kneeled on his neck as he gasped for breath. “We all have a responsibility to recognize this pain and the systemic racism that has caused it, and also to act by listening, reading, and supporting organizations that make justice their mission. This is especially important if you come from a place of privilege that protects you in some capacity,” wrote the top India American corporate leader, who is counted among the world’s most powerful women.In photos: Rage and anguish from George Floyd protests spreading across US cities “As we all consider how to heal this wound, I ask that we not lose sight of the power of our voices. I’ve always believed that confronting bias publicly is essential. If you see a bad actor, say it out loud and set an example for those around you,” she said. “And don’t be afraid of what you don’t know. Instead, be eager to participate in conversations that may make you uncomfortable and commit to learn more. It may not be easy, but it is critical,” she asserted. Nooyi cautioned that the road ahead will “undoubtedly be challenging”, and the scale of the work that needs to be accomplished is staggering. “Let’s vow to be kind, to roll up our sleeves, and to be part of the force that bends this path toward justice,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-all-have-a-role-to-play-says-indra-nooyi-as-protests-sweep-us/story-byHwnqINeR8S13dbgKkcmM.html
02-06-2020||India||‘Not the right time for any minister to speak about politics,’ says Aaditya Thackeray||Maharashtra’s tourism, environment and protocol minister Aaditya Thackeray spoke to Hindustan Times about the Covid-19 numbers, the unlocking plan, testing protocols, and the condition in state hospitals, among other issues. Edited excerpts:We’re speaking at a time when various states are emerging from the lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19, which has hit Maharashtra particularly hard. We’ve been on top of the situation, and the public has been very cooperative. Covid is one scenario where no one in the world has been able to predict how long it will go on for. We just started the mission “begin again” yesterday because lockdown has been around for 2-3 months and as we start opening up, it has to be very slow, staggered, carefully planned. We went into lockdown in a measured manner starting March 8, and the same has to be done while coming out of it.What’s the thought process behind opening shops but not malls? There have been several deliberations on this, from directions and observations from the World Health Organization to what other countries are doing. For instance, if there is single air circulation, is that more detrimental than not having air conditioning was one of the factors. Footfall was another factor. From June 2 or 3, we’ve made it possible for people to at least step out and get into a little bit of physical exercise but not go indoors. Then June 5 onwards, alternate sides of roads for shops, and from June 8 onwards, offices with 10% staff. All of this is always going to be trial and error, it will be a system of cooperation of citizens, a two-way process. What’s the thinking on schools? They usually open in June. Most of the schools, especially in red zones, are quarantine facilities and so we can’t open them right now. But, we’ve begun a process of speaking to people in the sector and how education can continue. Can we do it offline in green zones, what does social distancing mean, these are some of the deliberations that we are having. There was a meeting that the CM held with people yesterday in terms of education and technology and we can’t let academic year pass by without education beginning. Our school’s ratio is one teacher to 45 kids, so how do we do physical distancing there?The numbers in Maharashtra look... Scary, yes. The first and foremost principle we have to use as a government is to not fear the numbers. In cities such as New York and those in Brazil, the population is very different from the density in Mumbai. A higher number isn’t a higher infection that a neighbouring city or state, it only means that the government has been more successful in identifying the carriers and isolating them. You will probably have a peak sooner rather than later and so we have told all our officers on the ground, don’t fear the numbers, chase the case. Why aren’t you testing asymptomatic people? We are going by ICMR guidelines. The world over, asymptomatic people don’t need any intervention; they can self-isolate. Guidelines say you have to test high risk group between fifth and tenth day, and we are going by that. When you speak of hospital beds, we recall images from KEM hospital with patients lying amid dead bodies. Can you explain those pictures? We have said this before - there are a few things that have to be set in process once someone dies of Covid. You have to seal the body, you have to wait for someone to claim it, but apart from that, we are also clearing a lot more space for the mortuary. You have to understand the pressure the medical system is facing around the world, as no one has seen so many patients at one time in one place. So no matter what you do, you will have a shortage, as you have tons more people than you have hospital beds or ICU beds. We’ve moved into creating more hospital and medical facilities. In terms of beds for isolation wards, we had only 400 but in the last 15 days, we’ve gone to 5,000. We have to grapple with the gravity of the situation.Do you feel that you are getting all the help and cooperation you need from the Centre? If you have two different parties or two different coalitions are ruling at the state and Centre, then there will always be tussles. There has been great cooperation within the parties in the state and with the Prime Minister, the home minister and the chief minister. These three major entities have been in great cooperation and coordination with each other. That by far has kept politics aside during the time of the pandemic. I don’t think this is the right time for any minister to speak about any politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-don-t-think-this-is-the-right-time-for-any-minister-to-speak-about-politics/story-fs5LD63hBdasto12ekMjBK.html
02-06-2020||India||AP moves Supreme Court challenging HC verdict on reinstatement of state election commissioner||The Andhra Pradesh government on Monday moved the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the state high court’s orders reinstating retired IAS officer Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar as the State Election Commissioner (SEC).In a special leave petition filed in the apex court, the state government challenged the high court’s order striking down the ordinance promulgated last month which sought to reduce the tenure of the SEC from five years to three years and appointing a judicial officer of the rank of a high court judge as the SEC.The SLP is expected to come up for hearing on Tuesday or Wednesday, a state government official familiar with the development said.Meanwhile, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is leaving for New Delhi on Tuesday to discuss the issue with legal experts in New Delhi to present the government’s case in the Supreme Court. He would also be meeting Union home minister Amit Shah and other ministers to discuss certain issues pertaining to the state, the official quoted above said.On Friday, the high court bench comprising chief justice JK Maheshwari and senior judge Satyanarayana Murthy also struck down two government orders that followed the ordinance removing Ramesh Kumar as SEC and appointing retired judge of Madras high court V Kanagaraj in his place. The high court ruled that Kanagaraj’s appointment was illegal and Ramesh Kumar be allowed to continue for the rest of his tenure.Challenging the high court judgment, the Andhra Pradesh government argued that it had all the powers to appoint the SEC and the appointment of Justice Kanagaraj was done as per the statute. It appealed to the court to set aside the orders of the high court and allow Justice Kanagaraj to continue as the SEC.The state government, however, ignored the circular issued by Ramesh Kumar, soon after the judgment, that he was resuming charge as the SEC as per the court order and that he would discharge his duties fairly and impartially as he had done in the past and as mandated.State advocate general Sriram Subrahmanyam said Ramesh Kumar had no right to resume charge as the SEC as the high court had not mentioned when he should be reinstated. “There are several ambiguities in the high court judgment and we are filing an SLP in the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the high court order,” the advocate general said.Ramesh Kumar, however, said the high court had clearly directed the state government to restore his position as SEC and allowed him to continue in office until completion of his tenure which ends on March 31, 2021.“In the wake of the high court judgment, Justice Kanagaraju ceases to hold office as SEC. Since the office of SEC, a Constitutional post, cannot remain vacant, my position becomes status quo ante and I stand restored to the office of the SEC. Hence, I resumed the charge and proceedings were issued accordingly,” he said.Stating that the stand taken by the government was illegal, he said he was contemplating moving the high court again seeking restoration of his position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ap-moves-supreme-court-challenging-hc-verdict-on-reinstatement-of-state-election-commissioner/story-v0p8vmeHDr5ZbiW0uKU63J.html

He posed as Gautam, brother of a media person, to establish contact with an individual working in the Indian Railways. He tried to gain his confidence by pretending that he needed information about rail movements for his brother who was supposedly doing a story on the Indian Railways and for which he was willing to pay, said Anil Mittal, Additional PRO (Delhi Police).However, police said the real motive was to lure and trap the railway staff and then acquire information about movement of Army units and hardware via trains.In a statement released on Sunday, the Ministry of External Affairs had said, “The government has declared both these officials persona non grata for indulging in activities incompatible with their status as members of a diplomatic mission and asked them to leave the country within 24 four hours.” Sources had said the officials were working at the visa section of the Pakistan High Commission and confessed during the interrogation that they worked for Pakistani spy agency ISI.The sources had also said that the two officials were handing over Indian currency and an iPhone for providing them the documents.They had initially claimed that they were Indian nationals and even produced fake Aadhaar cards, the sources had said. In 2016, Delhi Police had busted an espionage racket, involving a Pakistan High Commission staffer, Mehmood Akhtar, who was allegedly involved in getting information about BSF deployments along the Indo-Pak border. He was expelled by India for spying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-high-commission-officials-wanted-to-extract-details-of-army-movements-via-trains-report/story-VBsWlxKPh7xmgbusqvxmYK.html

The central government which granted relaxations in a fresh set of guidelines that will be effective this week onwards has allowed for the reopening of restaurants, malls as well as places of worship from June 8 onwards. “All activities which have been allowed by the central government will be allowed in Goa too, but in Goa we may take some other steps too. We will finalise the decision by Monday evening if some other relaxations need to be given,” Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said. Goa being a ‘green zone’ state with all the recent cases of Covid-19 being detected among those who are entering the state, already enjoys considerable relaxations including the reopening of markets, public transport, shops and private offices. Ahead of the end of the fourth phase of the lockdown, the Goa Chief Minister had raised the issue of the reopening of restaurants and malls. “Most activities have started in Goa except for restaurants, hotels, malls, gyms. We believe that at least restaurants, malls and gyms should start with social distancing norms,” Sawant had said.The Goa government has already relaxed curfew norms allowing people to remain out of their homes up to 9 pm except for the movement of goods and essential services. “The night curfew period has been relaxed a bit as per the new guidelines. Goa will stick to the new timings and we will try to enforce this curfew at border check posts to ensure that our team can handle the flow of incoming people,” Revenue Secretary Sanjay Kumar had said at a press conference on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-to-allow-malls-restaurants-to-reopen-in-tune-with-central-guidelines-cm-sawant/story-1hKXY5Yj1zX95ao5Br4lJP.html
02-06-2020||India||Infighting surfaces in TMC in Amphan-hit districts, BJP alleges corruption in relief work||At a time when West Bengal is trying hard to recover from the losses suffered during Cyclone Amphan, incidents of infighting and clashes among Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers in the North and South 24 Parganas, two of the worst-hit districts, is making news.While top TMC leaders said internal differences are being sorted out, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders alleged that the infighting is over illegal commission from relief funds being distributed in these districts and share of timber collected from hundreds of uprooted trees.On Saturday, there were clashes between two groups of TMC workers in the Bhangar area of South 24 Parganas in which at least seven people were injured. A local TMC youth leader, Badal Mollah, allegedly sustained injuries from a crude bomb. One of the factions blocked the Basanti highway, demanding the arrest of TMC leader Kaiser Ahmed who is known to be close to a powerful leader. Bombs were also hurled at Ahmed’s office.“The police will take action. No one, no matter how powerful he might be, will be spared. I have briefed top leaders of the party,” said Saukat Molla, district president of the TMC’s youth wing, who is alleged to be a rival of Ahmed. Molla refused to comment on the cause of the infighting. “If there is infighting, the party is capable of taking care of it,” TMC secretary general and education minister Partha Chatterjee said on Sunday.“The infighting is over share of money being used for relief work. The ‘cut money’ (illegal commission) culture is an integral part of the TMC. With central funds coming in, the infighting has increased,” said BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu.In the North 24 Parganas, BJP MP from Barrackpore Lok Sabha seat Arjun Singh said, “Thousands of fully-grown trees fell during the cyclone. Some of this wood is very expensive. Infighting has started in many pockets over share of money from the sale proceeds. In this confusion, TMC workers attacked our men as well and police slapped a case against me. This is the 77th case filed against me. Once the number touches 100, I will offer a grand treat to people.”TMC North 24 Parganas district president and state food minister Jyotipriyo Mullick was busy in a series of meetings and could not be contacted despite several attempts. “The BJP’s allegations are baseless,” said a TMC MLA who did not want to be identified.Incidentally, one year ago chief minister Mamata Banerjee curtailed Mullick’s organizational powers following allegations that beneficiaries of state-funded welfare schemes were being forced to pay bribe. She divided North 24 Parganas in five organizational zones and empowered five legislators to take charge of each. Mullick was asked to consult them before taking any decision.Incidents of infighting in TMC units were reported over distribution of free ration and food during the lockdown as well. Mamata Banerjee had to say in public that nobody should try to take credit for relief work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/infighting-surfaces-in-tmc-in-amphan-hit-districts-bjp-alleges-corruption-in-relief-work/story-Hg1H2EtYYT7EyhpTVpgs4H.html

All of them have travel history. As the numbers are rising, I urge everyone to stay extra conscious, follow government instructions and co-operate with us,” Deb tweeted late evening. A total of 27,475 people have been tested for Covid-19 so far in the state. At least, 173 patients have recovered from the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-records-107-new-covid-19-cases-in-highest-single-day-spike-tally-rises-to-421/story-9FUqbhKyBHKaJ5c87QDteL.html
02-06-2020||India||Lok Sabha proceedings may move to Central Hall in Covid-19 reshuffle||To ensure the functioning of Parliament within constraints imposed by the coronavirus pandemic, Rajya Sabha (RS) chairperson Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha (LS) Speaker Om Birla have asked officials to explore the possibility of shifting the Lok Sabha proceedings to the Central Hall of Parliament for the upcoming monsoon session that usually starts in July.They have also asked if this can be accompanied with Rajya Sabha meetings being shifted to the Lok Sabha chamber, in a move that will be unprecedented in the history of Indian Parliament. Keeping in mind that the battle against the Covid pandemic might be a prolonged one, the presiding officers of both houses met on Monday to discuss various possibilities related to the monsoon session, said an official familiar with the development. Naidu and Birla also asked the two secretaries general of both Houses to look at the feasibility to hold the sitting of the two Houses on alternate days. In the longer term, they also explored the idea of having a virtual parliament with the use of technology. A column in Hindustan Times, on May 22, had floated the proposal to shift the LS to the central hall, and the RS to the LS chambers. All these measures, officials pointed out, are to ensure the government’s social distancing and health norms are adhered to while ensuring the normal functioning of the House. Naidu and Birla “have directed the Secretaries-General to examine the feasibility of using the Central Hall of Parliament appropriately to ensure social distancing,” said the official quoted above. “The options to be considered include; holding the meeting of Lok Sabha in the Central Hall with the Rajya Sabha shifting to the chamber of Lok Sabha and the sittings of both the Houses to be held on alternate days. The two officials were also directed to examine in detail various technical and other arrangements to be ensured to enable smooth functioning of both the Houses,” he added. The Central Hall, right in the middle of the Parliament Building, has a capacity to hold more than 800 people. This will allow 543 members of the Lok Sabha to sit, while maintaining a degree of distance. Similarly, 245 members of the Rajya Sabha can sit comfortably in the Lok Sabha chamber, ensuring social distancing. Chakshu Roy, head of legislative and civic engagement, PRS Legislative Research, said, “Putting the central hall for legislative functioning will be another innovative use of Parliament’s physical resources. And after a gap of 70-odd years, central hall will reverberate with the sound of spirited debate. And it’s not the first time, that the chamber of one house has been used by the other. In Hyderabad, the chambers in the legislative assembly complex were used by the two houses of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana legislatures in different shifts.”Even as the usual schedule of the monsoon session is from July to August, the government, however, has the power to hold it later. The Constitution of India says that the gap between the last day of the previous session and the first day of the next session should not be more than six months. As the budget session of Parliament was abruptly ended on March 23 amid Covid pandemic, the government has the liberty to call the session even in September, if it wants.The dates of the monsoon session will be decided after the proposals of cabinet committee on Parliamentary affairs proposals are cleared by the union cabinet.Both the presiding officers also discussed the need to adopt technology to enable online Parliament sessions as a long-term option when regular meetings look possible. “They have noted that since there is no requirement of maintaining confidentiality of the proceedings of both the Houses, which are open to general public besides being telecast live, virtual Parliament is an option to be explored,” said the official. In the meeting, the two presiding officers decided to refer the issue of virtual meetings of the parliamentary standing committees to the Rules Committees of both the Houses.The two Secretaries-General gave a briefing on the possibilities of virtual meetings of various committees of Parliament. They maintained that apart from a safe technological platform, complying with the rules of confidentiality of deliberations in such meetings is important. They also spoke about infrastructure upgrade to be undertaken to enable virtual meetings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ls-may-move-to-central-hall-in-covid-19-reshuffle/story-RRXXLex5U3LL4FdiGJFDyM.html
02-06-2020||India||Minimum Support Price for summer-sown crops hiked by 50-80%||The Union Cabinet on Monday approved federally fixed minimum support prices (MSP) for 14 kharif or summer-sown crops, which will give farmers a 50-83% return on their cultivation cost, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said.The announcement came as the June-to-September monsoon for 2020, predicted by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to be normal, made its onset over Kerala, its first port of call in the Indian mainland, on June 1, as predicted. A normal monsoon will likely lessen the strain on the agriculture economy from widespread disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The summer rains are critical because nearly 60% of India’s net arable land lacks irrigation and nearly half the population depends on a farm-based livelihood.The MSP for paddy, the main summer staple, has been raised by ~53 per to ~1,868 per quintal for the 2020-21 crop year, which will give a return of 50% on the cost of cultivation, according to an official statement. “(The) government has increased the MSP of Kharif crops for marketing season 2020-21, to ensure remunerative prices to the growers for their produce,” a Cabinet statement said. The highest increases in MSP are for nigerseed (~755 per quintal) followed by sesamum (~370 per quintal), urad (~300 per quintal) and cotton (~260 per quintal). “The differential remuneration is aimed at encouraging crop diversification,” the official statement said.For cotton, the MSP has been increased by ~260 to ~5,515 per quintal, Tomar said. The support prices of arhar or tur, a type of lentil, has been fixed at ~6,000, which represents a 58% return over cost of cultivation. This is an increase of ~300.The increase in MSP for kharif crops is in line with the Union Budget 2018-19 announcement of fixing the MSPs at a level of at least 1.5 times of the countrywide weighted average cost of production, which aims to give at least 50% returns for each crop. According to official calculations, the returns to farmers over cost of production are estimated to be highest in case of the coarse cereal, bajra (83%), followed by urad (64%), tur (58%) and maize (53%).“To correct demand-supply imbalances, the government has realigned the MSPs more in favour of oilseeds, pulses and coarse cereals to encourage farmers to shift to these crops,” said Abhishek Agrawal, an analyst with Comtrade, a commodities trading firm.Fresh indicators show the country’s farm sector, which employs nearly half the population, has coped well with the Covid-19 crisis, with a larger summer crop area than last year, higher sales of fertilisers and seeds, and better prices, leading Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das to last month call it a “beacon of hope”.The farm sector is poised to grow at least 3% in 2020-21, despite disruption in the economy due to the coronavirus pandemic, which will aid overall growth, according to state-run think-tank Niti Aayog’s assessment in April.There are other indicators too, ranging from sowing to input sales, which show the agriculture economy is heading into the summer-sown or kharif operations in decent shape.Farmers have planted rice in about 3.48 million hectares (1 hectare equals 2.4 acre) compared to 2.52 million hectares during the corresponding period of last year, an increase of nearly 37%, official data as on May 21 show.The area under pulses — a major summer crop with up to 70% share in farm incomes in some state — stands at nearly 1.28 million hectares against 0.96 million hectares during the same period of last year, which is higher by one-third (33%).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/msp-for-summer-sown-crops-hiked-by-50-80/story-FRkkFbeDm4gGRSovW6SOBN.html

The panel on Monday submitted its report dated May 28 to the National Green Tribunal that had constituted it. The leak left 12 people dead and caused hospitalisation of nearly 500 people. The committee, which included retired high court judge justice B Seshaseyana Reddy, conducted the inquiry at the plant on May 11, 12 and 14.The plant’s director (operation) and production manager G Raju tried to explain that he and others tried to add para-tertiary butyl catechol to reduce the intensity of the leakage. But two other employees of the company – M Achyut, shift-in-charge and P Balaji, manager – who were on the duty when the accident took place, told the panel that the moment they saw dense vapours coming from the tank, they ran away.“The mishap at LG Polymers plant was only due to human failure and negligence of the persons in charge of the plant and maintenance personnel of the storage tank. The management did not take proper care of the affected storage tank and it resulted in the leakage of Styrene due to auto-polymerisation,” the committee said in its report, a copy of which HT has seen.The employees told the committee that they did not see anyone making any effort to subside the intensity of the vapours. “Had any workmen been present at the effected tank, he should have been the victim of vapour gas and he should have been shifted to the hospital for treatment,” the committee observed. “The accident occurred on the wee hours of May 7 because of the excessive generation of heat...,” LG Polymers officials were not immediately available for a comment||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lg-polymers-staff-ran-away-at-time-of-leak-panel-report/story-ZTCj2IQBGdlZApKf1PdKsK.html

Clearly it’s going to be a matter that India and China will resolve.”Australia, he said, has a “substantial interest in stability and adherence to international law” in the South China Sea, where it is “concerned about the militarisation of disputed features” and has urged all parties to take meaningful steps to ease tensions.While Australian vessels and aircraft will continue to exercise their rights to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, all claims in that region should be resolved according to international law, and the “most sensible place” to resolve such matters is the UN, he said.The virtual summit, organised after Morrison called off a visit to India in January because of bushfires in Australia and also due to the impact on the Covid-19 crisis, is expected to see the signing of several agreements, including the Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) for reciprocal access to military logistics facilities.O’Farrell said the summit is also expected to advance an ambitious agenda that will include working together to improve regional and multilateral institutions, including on Covid-19 and public health, boosting science and tech cooperation, stronger collaboration on cyber-security and critical technology, maritime issues in the Indo-Pacific, critical mineral supply chains, education, and water resource management.“It’s as crucial as ever for like-minded democracies and important partners like Australia and India, at this time, work together to shape the type of region and type of world in which we want to live presently but importantly, post-Covid,” he said.India and Australia are committed to a free, open, inclusive and secure Indo-Pacific and strengthening and making their economies more resilient, have a shared goal of strengthening international institutions, he added.“I think there are many opportunities for India and Australia to assist each other’s supply chains. We support India’s policy of Make in India…but we have elements and resources that can strengthen and make more resilient the supply chain here in India,” O’Farrell said.The MLSA will make it easier for the militaries of both countries to conduct complex exercises and facilitate access to each other’s bases. Asked if Australia still hopes to be part of the Malabar naval exercise conducted by India, the US and Japan, the envoy replied: “Would we like to join Malabar? Yes, but we recognise that’s a matter for the partners who run the exercise to decide.”Defence ties between Australia and India, he said, are at a historic peak and activities had quadrupled in the past six years. The two sides also have a shared commitment as Indian Ocean powers and an obligation to secure a free and inclusive Indo-Pacific, he added.“That alone is going to ensure that our defence relationship in this part of the world is maintained,” O’Farrell said, adding last year’s edition of AusIndex, a bilateral naval exercise, witnessed Australia’s largest ever military deployment to India and MLSA will assist in future submarine patrols in the Bay of Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stand-off-along-lac-is-for-india-china-to-resolve-australia-envoy/story-xdrE4KgfVs6btkVFrIyntI.html
02-06-2020||India||For online reach, Rahul Gandhi may soon start podcasts||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi may soon try his hand at podcasting to counter Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s monthly radio broadcast Mann Ki Baat, people familiar with the development said.“Right now, we are at the planning stage and are discussing the finer points with the experts and asking them how to go about it,” said a Congress office bearer who refused to be named.A podcast is an audio message or discussion that is transferred or relayed digitally. “Once finalised, Gandhi’s podcast will be a counter to the Prime Minister Mann Ki Baat radio broadcast,” claimed the functionary quoted above.The former Congress chief launched his YouTube channel some time ago but started promoting it only during the lockdown period. It has so far got 294,000 subscribers.While Gandhi’s conversation with migrant workers saw a viewership of 752,000, his video interaction with health experts professor Ashish Jha and professor Johan Giesecke on coronavirus had over 90,000 views.PM Modi’s YouTube channel has 6.45 million subscribers apart from 57.9 million followers on Twitter and 45 million on Facebook. Gandhi has 14.4 million followers on Twitter and 3.2 million on Facebook.“We are also exploring other platforms such as LinkedIn,” the Congress functionary said.He claimed that the party’s social media campaigns during the coronavirus-induced lockdown had attracted “huge response” from the public.“Our ‘Speak Up India’ online campaign on May 28 was a huge hit. Over 5.7 million party leaders and workers uploaded their messages on different social media platforms throughout the day,” the functionary added.The daylong campaign was launched to put pressure on the central government to accept demands for providing immediate financial aid to farmers, migrant workers, daily wage earners and small businesses hit by the pandemic.“It is important for politicians to communicate with citizens in whatever ways they can. Podcasting can be a great way to interact, but only if the politician allows for a two-way communication. They have to find a way of talking with the people, not just to the people,” said Amit Verma, a Mumbai-based podcaster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-online-reach-rahul-may-soon-start-podcasts/story-9VSrmxUsS8HoxSLmqXqniP.html
02-06-2020||India||Rainfall favourable for breeding of locusts, but may slow march||Good rainfall in Rajasthan, other parts of northwest India, and cyclone Nisarga forming over the Arabian Sea will create favourable conditions for the breeding of crop-munching desert locusts along the India-Pakistan border but temporarily stall their movement as well, the Centre’s Locust Warning Organisation (LWO) said. “If there are good rains in Rajasthan, they will stay in the desert region and not move away, and if mature swarms come, they will breed here in the next 15 to 30 days depending on weather conditions,” said LWO deputy director K L Gurjar.Locust swarms reached new locations, chomped through vegetation and crops across farmlands in Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and prompted the Centre to issue a warning to 16 states last week. “They are presently in Madhya Pradesh’s Shivpuri area and moving towards Ashok Nagar, Bikaner and Nagaur in Rajasthan, Nagpur in Maharashtra and Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh. They are unlikely to move towards Bihar,” said Gurjar. He added LWO controlled a new swarm that entered Jaisalmer on Sunday. Locust swarms pose a severe risk to India’s agriculture this year, the UN has warned, and prompted the authorities to step up vigil, and deploy drones and other equipment to detect their movement. Their attacks are known to cause a considerable drop in agricultural output. Locusts can fly up to 150km in a day and a one-square-kilometre swarm can eat as much food as 35,000 people.R K Jenamani, a senior scientist at the National Weather Forecasting Centre, said the formation of any cyclonic circulation over the Arabian Sea brings moisture into north India and causes rain. “We are expecting thunderstorm and rainfall activity in east Rajasthan and in Delhi NCR [National Capital Region] on June 4 and 5. It has already been raining in parts of east Rajasthan,” he said.Northwest India is expected to receive excess monsoon rainfall at 107% of the long-period average this year, according to India Meteorological Department. Excess monsoon rains will also provide favourable conditions for the breeding of locusts in arid areas.According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), moist sandy or sand/clay soil to depths of 10-15 cm below the surface, some bare areas for egg-laying, and green vegetation for hopper development are the favourable conditions for their breeding. LWO has said it has controlled swarms over 55,000 ha across Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh mainly by spraying pesticides. According to FAO’s update dated May 27, locust swarms are forming in the spring breeding areas and migrating east to the India-Pakistan border ahead of the monsoon.“Spring-bred immature adult groups and swarms that arrived in Rajasthan from the west continued to move east in the eastern portion of the state and to the central states of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. As of 26 May, at least one swarm had reached to the northeast of Bhopal. Much of these movements were associated with strong westerly winds from Cyclone Amphan in the Bay of Bengal. Control operations are underway,” it said.Several successive waves of swarms can be expected until July in Rajasthan with eastward surges across India as far as Bihar and Odisha followed by westward movements and a return to Rajasthan based on changing monsoon winds. These movements will cease as swarms begin to breed and become less mobile. Swarms are less likely to reach south India, FAO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rainfall-favourable-for-breeding-of-locusts-but-may-slow-march/story-nK2lQMh5GaKFm42hx2egIP.html
02-06-2020||India||Pak mission official posed as journo kin: Police||A day after two Pakistan high commission officials – Abid Hussain Abid and Mohammad Tahir Khan – were apprehended on charges of espionage, the Delhi Police special cell probing the case said “Abid operated under several fake identities to lure persons working in organisations and departments of his interest”.Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah said during the investigation, it emerged that Abid impersonated posed as the brother of a media person to establish contact with an individual working in Indian Railways.“Abid tried to gain that individual’s confidence by pretending that he needed information about rail movements for his brother who was supposedly doing a story on Indian Railways and for which he was willing to pay money. The real motive was to lure and trap the railway staff and then acquire information about movements of Army units and hardware via trains,” added Kushwah said.A case under the Official Secrets Act has been registered by the special cell.A senior Delhi Police officer privy to the development said two Pakistani nationals were expelled by India after a joint team of Military Intelligence (MI) and special cell caught them allegedly obtaining classified materials on Indian security installations from defence personnel, who were used as decoy, at Bikanerwala Chowk in Karol Bagh at 10.45am on Sunday, A third Pakistani national was driving the car, in which the two came to collect classified materials and landed in the trap. The driver was let off after the Indian law enforcement authorities questioned him and found that he was not involved in the espionage.“It was the driver who confirmed that Abid and Tahir were associated with the ISI,” the officer said, adding that both of them were handed over to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).A statement issued by Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesperson, Aisha Farooqui, said the Indian Charge d’Affaires was summoned to the Foreign Office in Islamabad on Sunday for a strong demarche that conveyed Pakistan’s condemnation of the Indian decision to declare two officials persona non grata.“It was conveyed that the Indian action was in clear violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the diplomatic norms,” Farooqui said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-mission-official-posed-as-journo-kin/story-feOhFNxEAEejqCWDZruGYK.html
02-06-2020||India||Global factors lead to cooking gas price hike||India is losing the advantage of low international oil prices as its cost of crude imports in the rupee terms has surged by 69% in just two months, forcing state-run oil marketing companies to raise cooking gas prices for the first time after February by Rs 11.50 per cylinder. “For the month of June 2020, there has been an increase in international prices of LPG. Due to an increase in the prices in the international market, the RSP [retail selling price] of LPG in the Delhi market will be increased by Rs 11.50 per cylinder,” state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) said in a statement on Sunday.A 14.2 kg cooking gas cylinder in Delhi is now priced at Rs 593. Prices in other cities will vary depending on local levies.IOC said retail prices of cooking gas was slashed substantially by Rs 162.5 a cylinder in Delhi last month to Rs 581.50 because of a steep decline in international prices.India’s average crude oil import price surged by about 69% to Rs 2,516.77 per barrel in just two months, from Rs 1,491.57 a barrel on April 1, according to Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell of the oil ministry.Benchmark Brent crude, which had plunged from over $51.9 per barrel on March 2 to below $20 a barrel by April 21 due to slack demand and oversupply, is now hovering around $38 a barrel amid chances of prolonged supply cut by producers’ cartel and demand revival due to lifting of Covid-19 lockdowns in many countries, including India.There are indications that international oil prices may go further up as the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, particularly Russia (together OPEC+), are expected to meet on June 4 to discuss extending production cuts beyond this month.On April 12, OPEC+ decided to cut overall crude oil production by 9.7 million barrels per day or a 10th of global output from May 1 for an initial period of two months ending June 30. The producers’ cartel decided to shun the price-war among them and agreed to a synchronised supply cut to stabilise crude prices.SC Sharma, a former officer on special duty at the erstwhile Planning Commission, said two signs of international oil prices firming up are global demand is picking up fast, and OPEC+ could further extend the production cuts. “That may lead to oil prices going beyond $40 per barrel. In that situation, the oil companies may have to hike petrol and diesel prices by Rs 5 and Rs 6.5 per litre [respectively] or the government may have to reduce the additional excise. As the prices have not been revised by OMCs [oil marketing companies] for a month, any increase in import price beyond $30 per barrel may adversely impact OMCs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-factors-lead-to-cooking-gas-price-hike/story-jY6Tarsw6BODLm5ErtBaVN.html
02-06-2020||India||Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar’s kin linked to foiled J&K plot||The initial investigation into last week’s failed bombing in Pulwama’s Ayangund area has revealed the involvement of Mohammad Ismail Alvi, alias Lambu -- a close relative of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) chief Maulana Masood Azhar and the current head of the Jaish in the Valley -- who also played a key role in February 14, 2019 suicide bombing that killed 40 CRPF troopers, according to two counterterrorism officers familiar with the matter.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is likely to take over the probe of the failed bombing soon, the officials added. Ismail Lambu is already wanted by the federal agency for last year’s attack. One of the officers cited above said that Lambu, who is often referred to as Ismail Bhai and also goes by the moniker Fauji Baba, came to India sometime in late 2018 and helped Mudassir Khan, Khalid, and Mohammad Umar Farooq (last year’s Pulwama attack co-conspirators who were killed in encounters a month later) in collecting explosive material including gelatin sticks from stone quarries in the Valley, and ammonium nitrate from local shops.He took over the reins of Jaish in Kashmir this January after its Kari Mufti Yasir was killed by Indian forces.Ismail is an IED expert and helped other bombers of February 14, 2019 attack fit the bomb in Maruti Eeco van,” said the officer. Ismail’s deputy Sameer Ahmed Dar was also involved in last year’s suicide bombing, which was followed by an Indian launching air strike on a terror facility in Pakistan’s Balakot, and a subsequent dogfight between the air forces of the two countries.“We have information that Ismail Lambu planned to carry out similar car bombing in one of the camps or a convoy. The bomb was placed in the Santro car but it was detected on time in the wee hours on Thursday (May 28),” a second officer said. Forensic experts have hinted that the unexploded bomb was made of RDX, ammonium nitrate and nitroglycerin -- the same combination as the 2019 Pulwama bomb.“The similarities in both incidents shows the signature of JeM although it appears that Hizbul Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Taiba also may have participated in last week’s attempt as all the outfits are under pressure from Pakistan army to conduct a spectacular terror strike” the second officer said.The officers said they are scouring several “virtual mobile numbers”, social media accounts and emails to ascertain further plans of JeM, LeT and HM, which are operating under the banner of The Resistance Front (TRF), a front propped up by Pakistan to avoid embarrassment at international level.A virtual mobile number works through a server for which users sign up for a service by downloading and app on their smartphones. A number is generated by the app syncing it with a social media platform or an email account without linking it to a SIM card.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/azhar-kin-linked-to-foiled-j-k-plot/story-N73YV6YQTjBysnVGnWf3eP.html
02-06-2020||India||Monsoon arrives, normal rains likely, says IMD||The south-west monsoon made an onset over Kerala on Monday morning, keeping its normal arrival date of June 1, with heavy to very heavy rains and strong southwesterly winds blowing many parts of the state.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast on Monday that the monsoon this year was likely to be “normal” at 102% of long period average (LPA) with a model error of (+/-) 4% According to IMD’s second long-range forecast update for the monsoon, north-west India is expected to receive excess monsoon rainfall at 107% of LPA; Central India is likely to get 103% of LPA, while south peninsula and north-east India area likely to receive 102% and 96% of LPA respectively with a model error of (+/-) 8%. The forecast added that there is a 41% probability of a “normal” monsoon, 25% probability of an “above normal” monsoon, and only 5% probability of deficient rains. In its first long-range forecast released in April, IMD predicted that monsoon rain will be 100% of LPA this year. Normal is defined as 96 to 104% and above normal as 104 to 110% of LPA.Monsoon rains are critical for farmers in India, where nearly half the people directly or indirectly depend on agriculture for a living. Around 60% of the country’s net-sown area does not have any form of irrigation. Millions of farmers wait for the rains to begin the summer sowing of major crops such as rice, sugar, cotton, coarse cereals and oilseeds. Half of India’s farm output comes from summer crops dependent on these rains.“We are expecting very good rains this year. As you can see the forecast is skewed towards the positive side,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, Union ministry of earth sciences.According to global weather experts, El Nino Southern Oscillation (Enso) neutral conditions are prevailing over the equatorial Pacific, and neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions are prevailing over the Indian Ocean. El Nino is a climate pattern characterised by high sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean. El Nino years in India are linked to below-normal monsoon rains and higher-than-normal heat waves. Last year, weak El Nino conditions prevailed, leading to the delayed onset of monsoon.Global models are also indicating cool Enso conditions are likely to prevail this monsoon with some possibility of development of weak La Nina conditions, characterised by low sea surface temperatures across the east-central Equatorial Pacific in the later part of the monsoon season. “La Nina is good for the monsoon unlike El Nino. This is good news,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.“We can’t say anything this year because we haven’t made a forecast. Conditions are favourable for a good monsoon because of Enso neutral conditions. In fact, personally I think there will be above normal rains,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president (climate and meteorology) at Skymet Weather, which couldn’t release a forecast this year because of logisitical issues related to the national lockdown and because they are in the process of updating their models.According to IMD’s national weather forecasting centre, the monsoon has already advanced into all of the South Arabian Sea; Lakshadweep, most parts of Kerala and even some parts of Tamil Nadu. Kozhikode received 15cm rain from Sunday morning to Monday 8.30am, while Trivandrum and Kannur received 6cm rain each.“Kerala received very good rains and monsoon is advancing well. The winds are south-westerly and westerly, very strong winds. There are convective clouds over south-east Arabian Sea. All parameters for monsoon onset are now met,” said K Sathi Devi, head of the National Weather Forecasting Centre. He added that the monsoon winds were strengthened by the depression formed over south-east Arabian Sea, which is likely to develop into a cyclone on Tuesday. More than 70% of the 14 rainfall monitoring stations used to declare the monsoon onset over Kerala have reported rainfall during last 48 hours. Westerly winds have strengthened in the lower levels (wind speed up to 20 knots) and deepened up to 4.5km over the south Arabian Sea, IMD said. IMD’s onset guidelines include a clause that says 60% of 14 stations enlisted in Lakshadweep, Kerala and Coastal Karnataka should report rainfall of 2.5mm or more for two consecutive days.The south-west monsoon normally sets in over Kerala around June 1. It advances northwards, usually in surges, and covers the entire country around July 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-arrives-normal-rains-likely/story-7YUJ5BqDnobgxW5NDeCByN.html

Maharashtra state officials have snapped into disaster preparation mode as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) sounded a red alert for seven districts, including Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and Raigad on Monday, on account of a depression in the Arabian Sea that is expected to form into cyclone Nisarga, a severe cyclonic storm, on June 2 and make landfall on June 3 as well as cause heavy rainfall within inland districts till Thursday.Shah reportedly offered Thackeray the use of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams from neighbouring states. Maharashtra has 16 teams of which 10 are deployed in areas likely to be affected including three in Mumbai, two each in Palghar and Raigad and one in Thane. Each team comprises 45 jawans, and a 24x7 control room is also expected to function out of the Mantralaya building in Mumbai. More teams may be deployed on Tuesday, as the IMD revises its bulletin based on the progress of the weather system.Maharashtra, which is already reeling under the highest case load of Covid-19 infections in the country — it crossed the 40,000 mark on Monday — has issued special instructions to officials to devise ways in which positive patients can be shifted to safer locations in case the cyclone makes landfall as expected on Wednesday afternoon. It has also advised districts to maintain social distancing norms during the shift to relief shelters, if and when that happens. Non-Covid hospitals across the districts would be made available to tackle the disaster, a press note released by the CM’s office on Monday stated. Those living in “kaccha houses” along the coastline would also be shifted, and are being informed about the cyclone via loudspeakers, the note stated.Thackeray has also asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to shift slum dwellers staying in low-lying areas of the city to safer locations. Mahesh Narvekar, chief officer of BMC disaster management cell said, “Our preparations are underway based on the regular updates from IMD authorities.”Strict warnings have been issued to the fishing community to avoid entering the Arabian Sea and municipal officials are focusing on low-lying areas in Mumbai to determine whether Covid-19 centres would need to be re-located due to the very heavy rainfall expected over the following two days, an official said on the condition of anonymity.Prominent low lying areas in Mumbai include Hindmata and the flower market at Dadar, Century Bazar in Worli, Lower Parel station, SV Road Sacred Heart Church in Andheri, Malad and Marol naka, among others. Many of these areas are also part of wards which have some of the highest cases in the Mumbai city. At least 11 teams comprising officials of the fire, health and disaster management departments, as wells as 94 lifeguards are on alert, PS Rahangdale, chief fire officer of the Mumbai fire brigade and deputy municipal commissioner of the city disaster department said.The state has an outlay of Rs 1611 crore under its State Disaster Management Fund (SDRF), from which the funds are drawn for the natural calamities such as cyclones. The central government is expected to take up a share of 75% of the outlay. According to an official from the relief and rehabilitation department, district collectors are delegated the power to use these funds in case of calamities. “We have started making announcements near the shoreline. We have also asked power stations to be on alert in case of an emergency. All beaches will also be closed and we are also considering imposing section 144 to prevent any sort of crowding near the beaches,” Palghar district collector Kailash Shinde said.A cyclone alert has been sounded to all residents living within three km of the coast and a list of people who need to be evacuated from the low-lying in Palghar is being prepared, said Kiran Mahajan, deputy collector (general administration) said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-reeling-under-covid-19-braces-for-impact/story-FB062bzXCad4iGrLcYDavI.html
02-06-2020||India||Cyclone Nisarga: IMD issues red alert for Mumbai||Nisarga, a possible severe cyclonic storm that is expected to result from a depression forming in the southeast and adjoining east-central Arabian Sea and Lakshadweep area will impact Mumbai city which may experience high speed winds and extremely heavy rainfall, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said Monday as it issued a red alert for six other districts including Palghar, Thane, Raigad, Dhule, Nandurbar and Nashik between June 3 and 4. On Monday, the depression lay 310 km southwest of Panjim in Goa, 570 km south-southwest of Mumbai in Maharashtra and 800 km south-southwest of Surat in Gujarat. The depression is likely to move northwards till June 2 morning and then re-curve north-northeastwards and cross north Maharashtra and south Gujarat coasts during June 3 afternoon, which is when it is likely to make landfall. As per the current IMD forecast, the entire region between Daman (near Gujarat) and Harihareshwar in Raigad — comprising the Konkan coastline, which encompasses Mumbai — as well as some inland districts of Maharashtra, stand to be affected. However, the next 48 hours may bring further changes to the forecast Sunitha Devi, in-charge of cyclones at the IMD, said.“The landfall is expected towards the south of Mumbai. Since the Arabian Sea system is dynamic there are a few predictability issues. There might be further changes in the coming 48 hours depending on how the [weather] system moves,” she said. “An orange alert (to be prepared) will be issued 48 hours before the landfall while a red alert (to take action) will be issued 12 to 24 hours for the affected areas,” she said. Also read: Here’s how to live track Cyclonic storm Nisarga“It will pass over this region as a severe cyclone but there is a marginal reduction in wind speed expected. Mumbai is likely to experience high speed winds as the cyclone makes landfall south of the city,” Devi said.“We haven’t given an exact location of landfall yet. It will be shared as soon as reliable information is available but Mumbai will be impacted,” M Mohapatra, director general, IMD confirmed.Scientists said that Nisarga, which is likely to make landfall on June 3 afternoon could inundate low lying areas especially in cities like Mumbai and cause structural damage from falling trees and power poles. This has raised concern over how the city, already strained for healthcare resources on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, will cope. What’s more, each year the monsoon brings the city to a halt as train lines, streets and drains get flooded leaving lakhs of commuters stranded for hours. A red alert — which indicates the possibility of extremely heavy rain of more than 204.5 mm — is a warning for residents to take action and keep safe from adverse impact. It has been sounded for seven districts including Mumbai for Wednesday, and additionally on Thursday for Palghar. An orange alert has been sounded for Mumbai and Thane for Thursday.“The wind speed along with rough sea conditions in the landfall region will be capable of damaging weak structures such as huts, and thus affect poor people and fishermen who live on the coastline,” Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and doctoral researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom, said. While it is still early to ascertain where the storm might make landfall, the experience of cyclone Amphan — which the eastern coastline on May 21 and left 86 dead as well as millions homeless — is still fresh in national memory. “In the interest of public safety, local evacuation is advisable in such areas, which is likely to be challenging in the ongoing Covid-19 scenario.” Mumbai is facing a severe healthcare infrastructure crunch as hospitals and care facilities are unable to cope with the high number of cases, which stood at 41,099 cases as on June 1. “Central and state government agencies are trying to take all steps possible to prevent damage. We are specially advising fishermen in Maharashtra, Kerala, Coastal Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa, Lakshadweep to avoid going to the sea till June 4. Those out at sea should return immediately as sea can be very rough from now on,” Mohapatra said.According to the IMD bulletin, the system is expected to become a cyclonic storm by 11.30 am and a severe cyclonic storm by 5.30 pm on June 2. It is likely to make landfall by Wednesday afternoon. The wind speed is expected to be 105-115 kmph gusting to 125 kmph over east-central and northeast Arabian Sea along and off Maharashtra coast. “It is very unusual for a cyclone to make landfall in or near Mumbai or even on the Maharashtra coast. The storms that form during monsoon onset over Arabian Sea usually move towards Oman. Cyclone Phyan had impacted these districts in 2009 and even Mumbai had recorded extremely heavy rains,” Devi said.With the formation of two cyclones — in the Bay of Bengal (Amphan) and Arabian Sea (yet to be formed Cyclone Nisarga) — within two weeks of each other, scientists warn about the possibility of more pre-monsoon cyclonic storms in coming years due to warmer ocean temperatures. Dr. Roxy Mathew Koll, senior scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) Pune said, “We already see a detectable increase in the number of post-monsoon tropical cyclones over the Arabian Sea— and we need to ask if we are we moving towards a similar trend during the pre-monsoon also. We don’t know yet if this is part of a rising trend.”Scientists argue that anomalously warm ocean temperatures have aided in the genesis and rapid intensification of recent cyclones. The sea surface temperature in the Arabian Sea presently is as high as 32°C compared to a normal of 28°C expected during this season.However Mohapatra said that other parameters also need to be considered in the case of the expected cyclone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-on-cyclone-red-alert/story-9tip0ZW71o5U58RQonBS7L.html
02-06-2020||India||I don’t think this is the right time for any minister to speak about politics: Aaditya Thackeray||Edited excerpts:We’re speaking at a time when various states are emerging from the lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19, which has hit Maharashtra particularly hard.We’ve been on top of the situation, and fortunately, the public has been very cooperative and patient. Covid is one scenario where no one in the world has been able to predict how long it will go on for. We just started the mission “begin again” yesterday because lockdown has been around for 2-3 months and as we start opening up, it has to be very, very slow, staggered, carefully planned. We went into lockdown in a measured manner starting March 8, and the same has to be done while coming out of it.In this slow unlocking you have decided to open shops but not malls? What’s the thought process?There have been several deliberations on this, from directions and observations from the World Health Organization to what other countries are doing. For instance, if there is single air circulation, is that more detrimental than not having air conditioning was one of the factors. Footfall was another factor to see how spacing and social distancing would happen. From June 2 or 3, we’ve made it possible for people to at least step out and get into a little bit of physical exercise but not go indoors. Then June 5 onwards, alternate sides of roads for shops, and from June 8 onwards, offices with 10% staff. All of this is always going to be trial and error, it will be a system of cooperation of citizens, a two-way process. The slower we go the better.What’s the thinking on schools? They usually opens in June.Around June 10-13 is usual opening time. Most of the schools, especially in red zones, are quarantine facilities and so we can’t open them right now. But, we’ve begun a process of speaking to people in the sector and how education can continue. Can we do it offline in green zones, what does social distancing mean, these are some of the deliberations that we are having. There was an hour-long meeting that the CM held with people yesterday in terms of education and technology and we can’t let academic year pass by without education beginning. Our school’s ratio is one teacher to 45 kids, so how do we do physical distancing there?The numbers in Maharashtra look...Scary, yes. The first and foremost principle we have to use as a government is to not fear the numbers, especially when you have a pandemic of a global scale. In all cities such as New York and those in Brazil, the population is very different from the density in Mumbai. One feature is Mumbai’s community toilets and the way our houses are planned and the number of people living in them. A higher number isn’t a higher infection that a neighbouring city or state, it only means that the government has been more successful in identifying the carriers and isolating them. You will probably have a peak sooner rather than later and so we have told all our officers on the ground, don’t fear the numbers, chase the case. Why aren’t you testing asymptomatic people?We are going by ICMR guidelines. The world over, asymptomatic people don’t need any intervention; they can self-isolate. Guidelines say you have to test high risk group between fifth and tenth day, and we are going by that. When you speak of hospital beds, we recall images from KEM hospital with patients lying amid dead bodies. Can you explain those pictures?We have said this before -- there are a few things that have to be set in process once someone dies of Covid. You have to seal the body, you have to wait for someone to claim it, but apart from that, we are also clearing a lot more space for the mortuary. You have to understand the pressure the medical system is facing around the world, as no one has seen so many patients at one time in one place. So no matter what you do, you will have a shortage, as you have tons more people than you have hospital beds or ICU beds. We’ve moved into creating more hospital and medical facilities. In terms of beds for isolation wards, we had only 400 but in the last 15 days, we’ve gone to 5,000. We have to grapple with the gravity of the situation.There has been some amount of tension between Union ministers and state ministers, the exchange between CM Uddhav Thackeray and railway minister Piyush Goel. Do you feel that you are getting all the help and cooperation you need from the Centre?If you have two different parties or two different coalitions are ruling at the state and Centre, then there will always be those tussles. Most importantly, there has been great cooperation within the parties in the state and with the Prime Minister, the home minister and the chief minister. These three major entities have been in great cooperation and coordination with each other. That by far has kept politics aside during the time of the pandemic. I don’t think this is the right time for any minister to speak about any politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-don-t-think-this-is-the-right-time-for-any-minister-to-speak-about-politics-aaditya-thackeray/story-Fr94E5LgQO6Xvub1t7Hb1N.html
02-06-2020||India||Unlock 1: States differ on travel, quarantine protocols||Hyderabad/ Thiruvananthapuram: Andhra Pradesh and Kerala on Monday decided to continue with the requirement of electronic passes for entry into the states even as the Centre’s fresh guidelines allowed unrestricted interstate movement from June 1.The Centre on Saturday released details of the first of a three-phase plan--Unlock 1.0--to lift stringent restrictions imposed over two months ago to stop the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Places of worship, shopping malls, hotels and restaurants can also open from June 8.Hundreds of people from Telangana on their way to Andhra Pradesh were sent back because they did not have electronic passes. There was much confusion until 11 am on Monday when Andhra Pradesh police chief Gautam Sawang issued a statement saying restrictions on interstate movement would remain in force “till a further decision is taken”. The statement said all those seeking to come to Andhra in private vehicles should obtain an e-passes and undergo medical tests.“Those seeking to come from less coronavirus-affected states will be sent to home quarantine. Those coming from highly-affected states will be sent to institutional quarantine for seven days and they have to undergo tests for Covid-19. If they test positive, they should be sent to hospitals and if they test negative, they would have to be home quarantined for another seven days,” Sawang said. Kerala announced a series of measures to ease the Covid-19 lockdown even as curfew in containment areas (121) until June 30 will continue and there will be no entry into the state without passes. “...people who come for brief visits and for business are exempted but they will have to produce travel details. We cannot take chances now. More than 75% of the state’s [Covid-19] cases are imported,” said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. He added interstate travellers will have to obtain passes. Vijayan said a decision on religious places and restaurants will be taken after June 8 in consultation with the Centre. “In containment areas, the lockdown will be complete. It will be a curfew. There is no room for any complacency in such areas,” he said. The government has allowed marriage functions but guests should not exceed 50.Odisha said it will impose a weekend lockdown in 11 of the state’s 30 districts, where Covid-19 cases have surged. The highest single-day spike of 156 cases pushed the state’s tally to 2,104 on Monday. Odisha chief secretary Asit Tripathy said everything in these 11 districts will remain shut over weekends except hospitals, nursing homes, medical stores and fuel stations. He added the cases have risen because of the migrant workers, who have returned from Covid-19 hotspot states like Maharashtra and Gujarat. Tripathy said the workers account for 95% of the new Covid-19 cases in quarantine centres.States like Goa and Madhya Pradesh said they have adopted the guidelines fully and allowed interstate travel without passes and reopening of stand-alone shops. These states would decide on opening restaurants, malls, gyms and religious places on June 8 as per the Centre’s order.Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said they will grant all relaxations the Centre has allowed. “Most activities have started in Goa except for restaurants, hotels, malls, gyms. We believe that at least restaurants, malls and gyms should start with social distancing norms,” Sawant had earlier said.Himachal Pradesh chief secretary Anil Khachi said hotels have been opened only for non-tourism purposes for businesspersons and those coming on official tours. He added other than them, only residents of Himachal can book rooms there. Khachi said for the interstate travellers, seven-day institutional quarantine would continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-differ-on-travel-quarantine-protocols/story-TOfqcLEbFlLKqW1eHYN0NL.html
02-06-2020||India||Govt issues list of over 1,000 imported items banned at CAPF canteens, then revokes it||An order issued by an authority under ministry of home affairs over the weekend listing “imported” products removed from the list items for sale at canteens run for central police force personnel was rescinded on Monday after confusion over some of the items classified as foreign, people aware of the matter said. A reworked list would be issued soon, one of them added.Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) director-general AP Maheshwari, who heads the Welfare And Rehabilitation Board of central police forces, said the order regarding the delisting of certain products was erroneously issued. “The list has been withdrawn and action is being initiated for the lapse,” he said.Among the products listed in the rescinded circular were Dabur’s products like Real Juice, around 30 products of Bajaj Electricals, almost entire range of VIP Industries that produces bags and trolleys, and several electronics and electrical items of international brands which are largely made in India only. Other items that were delisted by rescinded order were Timex’s watches, Proctor and Gamble’s shaving range, Philips home appliances, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Panasonic’s vacuum cleaners, speakers, etc, Nestle’s milk powder, LG’s range of appliances as well as Colgate’s oral hygiene products. Kendriya Police Kalyan Bhandar (KPKB) chief executive officer RM Meena, who is a deputy inspector general rank officer, issued the order on May 29, a fortnight after Union home minister Amit Shah on May 13 announced the canteens will sell only indigenous products beginning June 1. Shah’s announcement came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for popularising local commodities to make India a self-reliant country in the face of the challenges the Covid-19 pandemic poses.KPKB, which runs the canteens across India, created three categories of the products sold there, according to the order, a copy of which HT has seen. Category 1 included those made in India from scratch. Category 2 listed products manufactured or assembled in India with imported raw material. Category 3 specified 1,026 “purely imported products” and included chocolates, air conditioners and televisions manufactured by Italian and South Korean firms.The order said there were seven companies importing finished products and selling them in India. It underlined that they had categorised the products solely based on the information provided by the firms manufacturing them. “In case of any litigation, the information provided by the firm will be used as evidence and the onus to prove the information is correct will be on the respective firm,” the order said.Shah on May 13 said the canteens do an estimated business worth Rs 2,800 crore annually. The canteens cater to 5 million family members of about one million personnel involved in internal security and border guarding duties.The central police forces include CRPF, Border Security Force, Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Central Industrial Security Force, Sashastra Seema Bal, National Security Guards and the Assam Rifles.There are around 119 master and 1,625 subsidiary canteens across the country — from border to Maoist-insurgency-hit areas. The canteens were set up in 2006 following demands by central paramilitary personnel who cited the army has such canteens. They have been selling local products to a large extent, following an October 2019 order that asked them to shun foreign brands and introduce “swadeshi” goods, including food items, accoutrements for combat and regular duty uniform, bed sheets, towels, household goods, clothing and stationery. Harish Bijoor, Brand Guru and founder at Harish Bijoor Consults Inc said “These are rather quick reactions which certain central bodies have taken. It’s not a good thing to do. You (government) should not hurt a made in India product. The fallouts need to well thought-out before jumping the gun, which definitely was the case here. There is a need to have greater degree of care, intent and listing. Just because a brand name sounds foreign, it doesn’t mean it is foreign made”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-issues-list-of-over-1-000-imported-items-banned-at-capf-canteens-then-revokes-it/story-X6ePa6gOYIIElCXT5ncEGO.html
02-06-2020||India||24 Rajya Sabha seats to go to polls on June 19: Election Commission||Elections to fill 24 seats in the Rajya Sabha — 18 older vacancies and six new ones — will be held on June 19, the Election Commission (EC) announced on Monday. Earlier this year, 55 vacancies had arisen in the Upper House, of which 37 candidates were elected unopposed in March. Elections for 18 remaining seats were earlier scheduled for March 26, but had to be deferred after the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and the imposition of the national lockdown to curb its spread.As per the EC’s revised schedule, polling will be conducted for four seats each from Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka; three seats each from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan; two seats from Jharkhand; and one seat each from Manipur, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya. For the six new seats, the last date for nominations is June 9, and last date of withdrawal is June 12.The commission has also decided that chief secretaries will depute a senior officer from the state to ensure that the extant instructions regarding Covid-19 containment measures are complied with while making arrangements for conducting the elections.The current strength of the house is 224; of which the BJP has 75 members and the NDA’s tally is 88. Parties that are not part of the NDA, but are friendly to the BJP include YSRCP, AIADMK, BJD and TRS — these together have 27 MPs. The Congress has 39 MPs and the opposition block with regional parties has 69 MPs. There are three independents and one nominated member. MDMK, PMK and Tamil Maanila Congress have a single member each. Of the 24 seats going to polls, the BJP is expected to bag 2 of the three seats in MP, one each in Rajasthan and Jharkhand, two in Karnataka, and one each in Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram. In Andhra Pradesh, YSRCP is expected to win all four. The battle for the upper house will also see some significant political heavyweights in the fray. The BJP is aiming to win both the seats from MP; it has named Jyotiraditya Scindia and Sumer Singh Solanki as candidates here. The Congress has nominated Digvijaya Singh and Phool Singh Baraiya.In Jharkhand, the BJP’s candidate is state unit president Deepak Prakash while the Congress has named Shahzada Anwar. In Gujarat, the BJP’s candidates are Ramilaben Bara and Abhay Bhardwaj and the Congress has named Shaktisinh Gohil and Bharatsinh Solanki.From Rajasthan, the BJP has named its state vice-president Rajendra Gehlot as candidate, while the Congress contestants here are KC Venugopal and Neeraj Dangi. In Andhra Pradesh, the YSR Congress nominees are P Subhash Chandrabose, Mopidevi Venkataramana, Alla Ayodhya Rami Reddy and Parimal Nathwani.The 37 MPs elected unopposed have not yet been able to take oath. Though the Rajya Sabha secretariat had picked two sets of dates for the ceremony, several MPs have expressed their inability to travel. The dates for oath ceremony will now be announced afresh, said an official aware of the details.Gujarat-based political commentator Vidyut Joshi said there is nothing wrong with the Election Commission announcing the election schedules in the middle of a pandemic since these are indirect polls that do not involve rallies and campaigns. “All eyes will be on how the BJP manages to win three of the four seats in Gujarat. The calculations favour two seats each to the Congress and the BJP; however since the BJP fielded a Congress rebel Narhari Amin to woo the Patel votes, there will be a keen contest,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/24-rs-seats-to-go-to-polls-on-june-19-ec/story-hnmLbowKUmaPc9j2qBQOJL.html
02-06-2020||India||Unemployment rate in May unchanged at 23.5%: Data||The country’s unemployment rate remained unchanged at 23.5% in May 2020, despite easing of a nationwide lockdown, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). The number people looking for work has however increased significantly, the CMIE’s survey showed. According to data from CMIE’s website, the rate of unemployment in urban India stood at 25.6%, higher than rural India’s 22.6%.Not surprisingly, the country’s factory output, a key measure of economic activity, shrunk by 16.7%, data from the Central Statistics Office had shown on May 12, signalling that a widespread shutdown hit the economy hard. But according to CMIE’s data, the lockdown’s relaxation seems to have impacted the labour participation rate, which indicates the percentage of all people of working age who are employed or are actively seeking work. “Evidently, people are coming back to the labour markets as the lockdown eases,” CMIE’s Mahesh Vyas said.The labour force participation rate has bounced back up from its lowest level of 35.4% in the week ended April 26. In the next week ended May 3, it stood at 36.2%. It then shot up to 37.6% in the week ended May 10. In the latest week of May 17, it increased to 38.8%, indicating demand for work.In any jobs survey, people with jobs are categorised as employed. People without jobs but looking for work are considered unemployed. However, the labour force participation rate is simply equal to people who are employed plus people who are not employed. In a rough-and-ready sense, the unemployment rate is then simply the number of unemployed divided by the total labour force times 100.According to Vyas, on a weekly basis, the week ended May 24 recorded an unemployment rate of 24.3%. This is a shade higher than the 24.0% unemployment rate recorded in the preceding week. “It appears that the unemployment rate is around the same level as it was in April. It is higher by a whisker. The small relaxations in the lockdown since April 20 have not had any positive impact on the unemployment rate, yet,” Vyas said.According to data sourced from the CMIE’s unemployment tracker, unemployment was highest in Jharkhand at 59.2%, followed by Bihar at 46.2% and Delhi at 44.9%. The rate of joblessness was lowest in Uttarakhand at 8.0%, followed by Assam and Odisha, both at 9.6%.When growth stumbles, vulnerable jobs without safety nets take the first hit. Unemployment then spreads to more secure setors.Job losses in the consumer durables manufacturing sector has been huge, analysts say, leading to de-growth. “Discretionary segments such as household appliances, readymade garments and quick service restaurants (QSRs) will bear the brunt of the pandemic blow and see the steepest revenue declines under both scenarios as stretched working capital cycles will put a squeeze on liquidity and hurt profitability. These segments will also take the longest to recover post-lockdown, with discretionary spending taking up to a year to revive,” said Rahul Prithiani, director Crisil Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unemployment-rate-in-may-unchanged-at-23-5-data/story-8YfiFHljEHvpwwDR0ksU1K.html
02-06-2020||India||Try to keep middle seats empty: DGCA to airlines||The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Monday told commercial airlines to ensure middle seats are kept vacant on flights if the passenger load permits, or provide flyers seated on these seats with additional protective equipment such as wraparound gowns. DGCA said the guidelines on air travel were tweaked based on the recommendations of an experts’ panel the civil aviation ministry constituted on May 26 to review and strengthen public health protocols. “The airlines shall allot the seats in such a manner that the middle seat/seat between two passengers is kept vacant if the passenger load and seat capacity permits the same,” the civil aviation regulator said in its order. It added that members of a family may be allowed to sit together.“If the middle seat is occupied due to passenger load, then additional protective equipment like ‘wraparound gown’ (ministry of textiles approved standards) shall be provided to the individual occupying the intervening seat in addition to the three-layer face mask and face shield,” said the order.The directive came a week after the Supreme Court allowed Air India to keep middle seats occupied till June 6 on its “Vande Bharat” flights for the repatriation of Indians stuck abroad because of the national lockdown, but said that the airline must follow an interim order passed by the Bombay high court in this matter. To be sure, the matter in question was only related to international rescue flights, and the high court’s interim order (to be delivered on June 4, according to the top court), or the Supreme Court’s observations on May 25, were unlikely to have a bearing on domestic flights, which resumed after a two-month break starting on March 25.While commenting on keeping middle seats occupied, the Supreme Court had observed: “How can you say it will not affect anyone? Outside [aircraft], there should be a social distancing of at least six feet. Will the virus know it is in the aircraft and is not supposed to infect?” The reference was to strict social distancing norms in terminals -- during check-in, security check, and boarding.Earlier this month, civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri earlier this month said keeping the middle seats vacant has not been an option for any airline in the world. “Airlines already operate on very thin margins and if you keep one-third of aircraft empty, many of them will choose not to fly. This might be counterproductive. We would need to take other precautions,” he said.Flyers have to be provided safety kits, including three-layered surgical masks, face shields and sanitizers as per the guidelines.“The MHA [ministry of home affairs] guidelines for [Covid-19] lockdown 5.0 announced on May 30 will facilitate the gradual & calibrated reopening of aviation sector. As we move towards critical mass of 50-60 per cent operation of domestic flights, our ability to resume international operations will also improve,” Puri tweeted on Monday.“We are reviewing the order and will incorporate amendments as necessary to our operations to comply with it.

02-06-2020||India||‘Too busy’: BS Yediyurappa as dissent swirls around in Karnataka unit||Even as the BS Yediyurappa government completes its first year in office next month, several senior leaders and legislators are reportedly unhappy with the chief minister’s style of functioning. The party received a jolt last week after several leaders - majority of them hailing from Northern Karnataka and part of the powerful Lingayat community - met to discuss their unhappiness.Among the key leaders at this luncheon meet were: Umesh Katti, an eight-time legislator and a former minister; Murugesh Nirani, a former minister and an industrialist, Basvraj Patil Yatnal, a former union minister known for his straight-talking ways. Katti and Nirani have been aspirants for a cabinet berth even as Yatnal is eyeing a role either at the Centre or in the state.Even as they publicly swore loyalty to the party and said that they were disciplined soldiers, a crisis has been brewing in the party over several issues. These include rewarding loyalists who feel that those who joined from the Congress-JDS have walked away with plum ministerial berths, perceived interference in the government by Yediyurappa’s family members - especially by his second son Vijayendra, who is the head of the state youth wing - as well as need for a leadership change.Seventy seven-year-old Yediyurappa is an exception at a senior level in the BJP as the party has a national policy of retiring leaders once they cross the 75-year mark. After the by-elections, while the BJP got an absolute majority, the price it paid was rewarding the Congress-JDS legislators who crossed over to help it form government with ministerial berths at the cost of loyalists.Chitradurga MLA and senior BJP legislator GH Thippa Reddy, admitting to the media unhappiness on that front, said “Yes, there is unhappiness in the party about senior leaders being ignored and social justice not being given consideration in the constitution of the cabinet.” Reddy’s angst was directed at legislators who had crossed over from the Congress and the JDS and were made ministers while loyalists who had stood by the party have been ignored.Ramesh Katti, the brother of Umesh Katti, said that he has reminded the chief minister of his promise to send him to the Rajya Sabha after he was denied a ticket in the Lok Sabha polls. Not to be left behind, several other legislators have now publicly thrown their hat into the ministerial ring with some of them, say, Haveri legislator Nehru Olekar publicly saying that they are also aspirants for the same.The other sore point has been what is seen as interference in the administration by BSY’s family members. BY Vijayendra, the politically ambitious younger son of Yediyurappa, had to clarify that he was not an aspirant for an MLC berth, saying “there are several senior people deserving ahead of me”.When queried about the hush-hush meetings of senior legislators, Yediyurappa on Monday tried to display nonchalance, saying, “I am too busy with work regarding development of the state and controlling the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, I have decided not to worry about such developments and will thus not comment on the (dissidence) issue.”However, a senior minister in the BSY’s cabinet, who did not want to be identified, told HT: “We still have three more years (in power) and high command knows he (Yediyurappa) will be 80 by then and we need to have a replacement. Several of our legislators who have worked for decades in the party have not been rewarded but because of the circumstances those who came from elsewhere have been, this needs to be rectified. Also whoever replaces him needs to be given adequate time to make a mark.”Two of the deputy CM’s Lakshman Savadi and CN Ashwath Narayan also claimed that while there was no dissension in the party, there were some issues which need to be addressed.Congress spokesperson VS Ugrappa said that while they are not concerned about the internal strife within the BJP, but are worried about the impact it is having on the state administration which has almost “come to a standstill”.“Karnataka is facing one of its biggest financial and humanitarian crises and all the ruling party can do is fight amongst itself, which is unfortunate,” said Ugrappa.Senior political analyst Prof Harish Ramaswamy says that it is just a matter of time before Yeddiyurappa is replaced.“While the high command may want somebody like a BL Santhosh (national organisation secretary) or Pralhad Joshi (union minister for parliamentary affairs), the caste matrix amongst the support base of BJP will not permit it. The Lingayat leaders realise that it has to be amongst them which is why somebody like Jagadish Shettar, who is a former CM and a Lingayat, could be a candidate or a Umesh Katti who is also a senior legislator,” said Ramaswamy.Yediyurappa might have been necessary for the BJP if it wanted to come to power, added the professor, but now it may look to replace him and build a long-term younger leadership for the party in the state.“For this they would need to have Yediyurappa and his family agree to the leadership transition as he has shown his power to take away a chunk of the vote when he walked out of the BJP in 2012,” said the political analyst.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-s-unhappiness-karnataka-mla-complains-leaders-ignored-in-bsy-govt/story-R5xZIn5kO00ovQXEYxDUaP.html

The PM also wore it during his address to the nation on the occasion of the Independence Day on August 15, 2019, and several other public events as well, the letter said.The letter cited that the traditional ‘Leirum Phee’ designed as official ‘Lengyan’ (muffler) has cultural, historical, and emotional importance for the people from Manipur. The directorate has started the process of acquiring a geographical indication (GI) tag for ‘phee’, which means cloth in Manipur’s Meitei language, but the Covid-19 outbreak has stalled the process.On Saturday, a video started doing the rounds on social media that purportedly showed the production of ‘Leirum Phee Lengyan’, which was identified as a ‘gamcha’, in a power loom-run textile manufacturing unit in UP’s Barabanki district.Manipuri weavers and locals took exception to the mass production of what they claimed to be a product indigenous to their state and raised concerns about their loss of livelihood because it’s production has been undertaken at an industrial in UP, the country’s most populous state.Several social and civil society organisations, including Ethno Heritage Council, ACOAM-Lup, Kangleipak, Handlooms Promotion Council, Manipur, and All Manipur Ethnical Socio-Cultural Organisation, also urged the state government and the authorities concerned to safeguard the traditional ‘Leirum Lengyan’ and get it registered as intellectual property of Manipur.The production of traditional ‘Leirum Phee’ had started during the reign of the Manipuri king Loyumba in 1074-1112 AD, the letter said.‘Leirum Phee’ is woven on a handloom and used mandatorily during the Meitei community’s wedding ceremonies.The more popular ‘Leirum Phee’ was officially used in the first India ASEAN Motor Car Rally in 2004, the letter said.‘Leirum Phee’ has been used as a symbol in the state on every sociocultural occasion since the 2004 event, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-handloom-authority-urges-textile-ministry-to-stop-production-of-traditional-cloth-in-up/story-RjSN1idswMnWNp9w2WBqGP.html

He said that the scrapping of Article 370 was a bold decision that strengthened the country and realised the “one nation, one constitution,” which many had considered as an impossible task.Similarly, he cited the abolition of Triple Talaq as a laudable move that ensured justice to Muslim women. The decision not to join the “anti-farmer” Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a proposed free trade agreement in the Asia-Pacific region, was another such case in the point, the BJP chief said.Nadda accepted that the Covid-19 is an unimaginable crisis and there are no ready solutions to the pandemic.“However, the country stands with Modiji,” he added.He said the party would continue to move ahead with a progressive approach.Nadda hit back at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s criticism of the government’s inept handling of the viral outbreak and the migrant workers’ travails of returning to their native places amid the lockdown restrictions.The BJP president alleged that Gandhi did not display an “in-depth understanding” of these critical issues.“His statements smacked of bad politics,” he alleged.He also blamed the Congress for its “delaying tactics” on a resolution of the Ayodhya dispute and credited the government for its bid to construct a “grand Ram temple” under PM Modi’s leadership.Nadda said that the party is working towards launching a digital campaign, as the conventional poll campaign has to be dispensed with because of strict adherence to social distancing norms due to the viral outbreak.He announced that the party would hold digital rallies across the country to mark the first anniversary of the Modi government 2.0.On social media, the BJP posted videos claiming “bade faisle, kam hue fassle” (big decisions, bridging distances) is the hallmark of its rule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unimaginable-challenges-and-bold-accomplishments-bjp-chief-jp-nadda-lauds-one-year-of-modi-2-0/story-asgs3tl0gDOuYXjJUpALLI.html

02-06-2020||Editorials||Donald Trump presides over an anarchic turn||With his country experiencing its worst race riots since the 1960s, the standing of United States (US) President Donald Trump continues to shrink both at home and abroad. Over 40 cities are locked down in the original sense — under curfew for law and order reasons. And all this even as the country struggles with the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed over 100,000 lives. Both crises have shown up Mr Trump’s minimal leadership capacities. After the horrific manner of George Floyd’s death, the US president’s first tweets seemed to encourage police to shoot demonstrators. Though he has occasionally sought to rise above the occasion, Mr Trump continues to be a president with minimal presidential qualities. Mr Trump’s political success is partly attributable to deliberate polarisation. He has repeatedly sought confrontation with the supposed enemies of his white working-class base. The present riots, many of which have inevitably devolved into wanton destruction, may yet help his flagging poll figures. But even Republican strategists fear independent and suburban women, two key swing votes, will see things differently. Overseas, the riots have been gleefully highlighted by China. Beijing has been in the news for the wrong reasons recently, whether due to the pandemic or the crackdown on Hong Kong. Watching its geopolitical rival fumble the ball repeatedly will come as a relief. More worrying, it may encourage an already heightened sense that the Middle Kingdom faces no real check or balance in the international system. The US can do better and, for reasons well beyond its borders, it needs to.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/donald-trump-presides-over-an-anarchic-turn/story-nYjDHBEoSZdZmnfFzDnvBJ.html
02-06-2020||Editorials||Convene Parliament, now||With the coronavirus pandemic spreading in India, the budget session of Parliament ended abruptly on March 23, 12 days ahead of the schedule. This was the right call at the time. Social distancing norms were not being enforced; there was speculation about the possible spread of the disease among Members of Parliament (MPs); and the nation soon went into a lockdown. But a lot has happened since then. India is facing the most serious public health, economic, and humanitarian challenge in its independent history. This has led to a range of both immediate and far-reaching decisions by the government. Migrant workers across the country are heading back home and are largely subject to what can only be termed as rather arbitrary orders of the central government. India is now opening up — but this is expected to increase the number of cases. Through this process, while the government has addressed regular press briefings, and the prime minister has spoken to the nation, there has been no institutional accountability. It is time to convene Parliament and perhaps even call a special session. In this backdrop, the presiding officers of both houses met on Monday and came up with a set of options, including the possibility of a virtual Parliament using technology. This initiative is positive. But in the more immediate context, the big question is of logistics. A column in this newspaper had suggested the possibility of using the Central Hall for Lok Sabha sittings, and holding Rajya Sabha sittings in the Lok Sabha chambers. The Lok Sabha speaker and the Rajya Sabha chairperson have asked their officials to explore this option, as a way to enforce social distancing norms. With air travel and limited passenger trains operational, it is also possible for MPs to come to Delhi. The fact that the parliamentary standing committee on home affairs is scheduled to meet on June 3 in Parliament House itself is also a sign that other committees can be activated soon, through either direct meetings or on secure digital mediums. There are, of course, risks and precautions need to be taken. But democracy is too precious and Parliament is too valuable an institution to sit out a national crisis. India’s battle against the pandemic and its economic revival needs national buy-in; it also requires the executive to be accountable. And this can only happen in Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/convene-parliament-now/story-7ggA82RIgCUj5FDp32iRsK.html
