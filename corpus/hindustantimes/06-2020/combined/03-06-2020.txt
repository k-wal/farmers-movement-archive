03-06-2020||News||Corporate managers must rise to the challenge||Countries have been pushed into wartime-like efforts to combat the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-sparked crisis. The only parallel is the time when in the 1940s, large swathes of industry in the United States (US) were pressed into the production of goods required for the war. The current war against the virus has, by reopening debates about the deepening inequalities in society, raised the question of how companies, with their talents and efficiencies, can play a larger role in solving some of the challenges. The slew of economic reforms announced by the government provides an opportunity for Indian companies to now play such a role. Achieving this will require a paradigm shift in thinking across banks, company-owners and the government.The government’s stimulus package has some broad themes. First, the government intends to revive micro, medium and small enterprises (MSMEs) through the provision of guarantees to ensure the flow of credit. It will also do so by releasing capital locked into the reverse repo with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) or the cash reserve ratios with banks. However, transmitting unlocked reserves requires a different approach to risk-taking. Bankers will play a national role if they can, at least in the case of MSMEs who are existing borrowers, avoid total risk aversion, and encourage sensible lending that balances the need to keep jobs and consumption intact. After the depression, JM Keynes noted that when the facts change, economic theory must change. So too after Covid-19, lending practices must change to enable small business to recover.In this connection fintech lenders have, since 2015, made deep inroads into precisely the types of businesses facing the maximum pain now. In the US, major fintech lenders have been eligible for direct Federal Reserve funds, which are fully guaranteed, as a means to help fund small businesses. If banks and non-banking financial companies were to refinance fintech platforms, this will speed up credit flow. Large sums have been identified for investment through funds in the small and medium enterprises and agriculture space largely overseen by the Small Industries Development Bank of India. Here too conventional investment logic, which requires all projects to meet high hurdles for return, has less meaning when the more urgent need is to revive a stalled economy. There needs to be a clear acceptance that the multiplier effect of job creation, wages generation and demand can largely offset the impact of poor investment or lending.The desire to reform and privatise agricultural procurement, coal, defence and power distribution is commendable. In doing so, it is important to put aside old hang-ups which include concerns about anti-competitive behaviour and corruption during bidding processes, which held back past reforms. In the light of the fears among officials by the 2G and coal scams, there has to be clear communication from the government that officers will be rewarded for bona fide, aggressive steps to bring about change. This is not to say that gross negligence or cases of corruption should be allowed to pass muster. While not denying the likelihood of these risks, economies do not come out of crises by playing safe. A less noticeable-but-important change in approach is required of large shareholder investors. In assessing the returns they want from investments, they need to examine why when shareholders have done well in recent years, these increases in valuation have not touched other critical issues such as job creation, improving their green quotient or providing even two months of salary safety nets. In recent years, valuations of a few companies, especially in the technology sector, have left behind organisations which create high quality jobs, in the way General Motors (GM), Hilton or Unilever do. The desire for the market outperforming returns at all times has seemingly meant an unwillingness for investment in solid, useful, economy-enhancing plays, which pay 3-4% above the cost of capital but do not provide dramatic pay-offs. This is why, for example, in India, there is no market for a mortgage guarantee company, which would materially improve the quality of life. The institutional investing community may need to re-examine the lens through which it reviews its investments.Last and most critical, the proposed reforms provide a chance for industry to rise to the occasion as their forbearers had done in the immediate post-Independence era. Large corporate houses, which drive most of industry, have the opportunity to pick up the gauntlet in several new areas where privatisation has been offered. There is a full alignment between meaningful risk taking and national reconstruction as demonstrated by groups such as the Tatas, whose investments in power, software, chemicals and other industries were, in their day, pioneering, even though they might have been seen as risky at the time. Many other Indian groups have similar stories involving entering unrelated areas and placing their best talent behind new projects.Even with supportive mindsets from the groups above, successful national rebuilding will come by only if India’s large management pool relishes the opportunity to thrive under uncertainty and challenge. In the 1950’s Charlie Wilson, the CEO of GM said, “What is good for GM is good for America”. The opposite was also true. What is good for the country is also good for the individual company. As the government faces arguably the biggest challenge in India’s history, managers can play a greater part in the national response as some already do. Great managers are used to operating in difficult competitive environments. They will do a fantastic job of facilitating nationally meaningful outcomes such as job creation or privatisations of key industries without compromising on-long term returns if they are backed by their investors and promoters to do so. One hopes that the response to these bold reforms will be India’s World War II moment, after which the corporate sector applies its talent, financial muscle and risk appetite to the task of nation-building.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/corporate-managers-must-rise-to-the-challenge/story-JBLpDj5XCt85KfoJPbak1H.html
03-06-2020||News||‘Immune organisations’ can withstand disruptions||There is this immortal verse in JRR Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings to describe the all-powerful Ring, which has the power to destroy the biggest known evil, Sauron, the Lord of Mordor: “In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie/ One Ring to rule them all/ One Ring to find them/ One Ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them.”The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic is unfolding around us in all its destructive horror as the world races to find the One Ring which can destroy it — a vaccine. The right vaccine, it is hoped, will grant immunity by triggering the creation of the right antibodies against a future outbreak. But what if Covid-19 itself was a vaccine, and the organisations and societies of today could learn from it to build the antibodies they need to garner immunity against future disruptive calamities? If vaccine technology can help a human body become immune with an inoculation of “weak” pathogens, then it is conceivable that we can adopt the same approach for our companies. Could we use and apply the learnings of this disruption and leverage technology and design to build an “Immune Organisation”, which is resilient to future shocks? So, when the next big disruption (perhaps triggered by global warming, for instance) comes, it may not prevent a complete business interruption, but could help the world get on its feet much faster if the right antibodies were developed. As Gandalf, the Grey says in the Lord of the Rings, “The burned hand teaches best.” I have identified seven such “antibodies” which an organisation can develop. One, the decentralisation of work. Decentralisation resists disruption much better than centralisation. Take work for example, where working from home, and in fact anywhere, has saved the day for many companies. Decentralised kirana stores perform better than malls, a decentralised gig-economy such as food-delivery and e-commerce has kept many countries running. To survive future disruption, companies need to decentralise their operations.Two, re-imagining business models. Businesses with purely digital models have gained; those with purely physical ones have ground to a halt. Not all businesses can be totally digitised, but companies will need to rework business models to digitise whatever they can — build e-commerce, health companies to develop tele-health, schools to build online education.Three, building a partnership ecosystem. Companies will need to build a strong, unconventional partner ecosystem. Witness the ITC Foods-Dominos tie-up, or liquor companies riding on Zomato and Swiggy. Four, automation. Everything that can be automated needs to be. This will ensure business continuity and productivity, even when people cannot be there to do the work. It will also cut costs, unfortunately often at the cost of jobs. But automation is inevitable for companies and a powerful antibody to immunise a company.Five, lifelong learning, multiple jobs. The future of work has been fast-forwarded by the virus. Work from anywhere is one indication of that. The other is that employees will need to continuously re-skill to stay relevant. Additionally, employees may hold multiple jobs, so that if one goes, the other survives. Companies will be far more tolerant of this, and the permanent-temporary employee distinction will disappear. Lifelong learning, not lifelong jobs, will be the norm. Six, re-imagining customer journeys. Covid-19 has change the customer journey, with social distancing, sanitisation and work-from-home becoming the norm. This will mean that every company will have to tweak its business for this new customer journey, and future proof itself.Seven, mindset and cultural transformation. This is the most formidable, the Gandalf of antibodies. While culture and organisation changes move sometimes in glacial, geological time frames, a cataclysmic event such as a pandemic can change mindsets and cultures almost instantly. All the other antibodies require this most potent one to be developed first. Once created and internalised, it is so much easier to build the others, and develop a high degree of organisational immunity. For example, CEOs have had an instant change of heart on a previous anathema, working from anywhere. The pandemic has also forced delegation, and authority has moved down to the customer-facing roles. One of the great paradoxes of this pandemic is that it has slowed the world down, but simultaneously accelerated change. It is not the easiest of times to live in. But we need to make the most of it; we need to grasp this change, learn from it, and immunise ourselves against future shock. “I wish it need not have happened in my time,” said Frodo Baggins in the Lord of the Rings. “So do I,” said Gandalf, the Grey, “and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.”Jaspreet Bindra’s latest book, a short read called The Immune Organisation released recently on Kindle. He has also authored The Tech Whisperer, and is a digital transformation and technology expert The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/immune-organisations-can-withstand-disruptions/story-F7ZJ3diop4K2YWB4pJ3pzI.html
03-06-2020||News||India is sensitive to China but won’t allow change in any border sector||At the 2019 informal summit between India and China at Mamallapuram, on the periphery of Chennai, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping decided to celebrate the 70th anniversary of bilateral relations in 2020 by deepening exchanges at all levels — between the legislatures, political parties, cultural and youth organisations, even the militaries of the two countries. The two leaders also decided to organise 70 activities, including a conference on a ship that would trace the historical connect between the two civilisations.No one expected that rosy diplomatic picture would turn as grim as it has now, with the spread of the coronavirus that was first reported from Wuhan — ironically, the site of the 2018 informal summit between India and China — and with war clouds gathering over eastern Ladakh. This has happened within seven months of the Mamallapuram meet, which saw the reiteration of a desire for peace and tranquillity in the border areas and a commitment to work on additional Confidence Building Measures (CBMs). Yet, today, the Indian Army is facing two aggressive Combined Arms Brigades of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at Galwan Valley and Pangong Tso patrolling points along the 3,488-kilometre-long Line of Actual Control (LAC).ALSO WATCH | Explained: Trump’s G7 offer for India, how it may help amid China standoffIn May, PLA first activated LAC at Naku La area in north Sikkim and then at three points in Galwan and one point at Pangong Tso. While the Chinese defence ministry spokesperson has said that the situation in Ladakh is “stable and controllable,” this appears to be a gross understatement as the two armies are literally at each other’s throats. This fragile situation does not augur well for bilateral relations. It has already turned the normally-dormant LAC active, forcing India to deploy troops on the northern border and prepare for the worst-case scenario. Much as India’s detractors would like to remind it about the 1962 border skirmish with China, the fact is that even PLA would have to move troops from the hinterland to protect its own territory if the red flag goes up. As of now China has 76 and 77 group armies (around 45,000 men) along with an option of six to eight divisions of troops from Tibet and Xinjiang military district holding the Western Theatre Command facing India. With India rapidly building force levels in eastern Ladakh, it will be only a matter a time before PLA calls for reinforcements from the hinterland if status quo ante is not restored.Given that India’s lines of communication and air bases are closer to LAC, the scenario may not favour PLA. For instance, its Russian copy fighters will suffer severe load penalty if they take off from the rarefied Tibetan plateau. The PLA has already lost the element of surprise after days of stand-off, and the next question facing Chinese generals would be whether their troops can force a decisive victory. The PLA generals, who have studied the Kargil war more seriously that anyone, know that the Indian Army can and will fight against all odds. Even though China is now sabre-rattling at the border, it also knows that India has a very strong leader in PM Narendra Modi, who has not named China for spreading the Covid-19 virus, maintained a studied silence over the treatment of minorities in Xinjiang, not commented on the draconian laws in Hong Kong, and stayed silent while others have pushed for an observer status for Taiwan at the World Health Organization.By openly favouring a direct dialogue with China on the border issue, India has also kept its ally, the United States, at bay as it does not believe in hyphenation and fiercely guards its strategic independence. PM Modi’s move to restrict foreign direct investment from neighbouring countries — a move clearly aimed at China — shows that India has the capacity and capability to react. But it is also not catalysing the resentment against China at the behest of the Trump administration. The fact is, it is Beijing which is using neighbours such as Pakistan and, more recently, Nepal to project its dominance in the Indian subcontinent and beyond. The argument that the Ladakh stand-off is a result of the Modi government abrogating article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir does not hold good as no less than Foreign Minister S Jaishankar flew to Beijing last August to reassure China that India was not raising any additional territorial claim on contested areas in the region. By aggressively posturing on the border, China has added insult to injury as Beijing has hardly addressed India’s demand to reduce the trade deficit, which stood at $51.68 billion from January-November 2019 before the pandemic struck the world.Still, with both leaders previously committing to not turning bilateral differences into disputes, it would be in the interest of both parties to withdraw to their respective base camps in Eastern Ladakh as there is no way that India is going to allow China to make unilateral changes in either of the sectors. The Modi government will also not come under pressure from China on its legitimate border infrastructure upgrade, which is happening well within its own territory. After 21 rounds of hardly productive Special Representative Dialogue on the resolution of the boundary issue, it is time that the two sides at least exchange maps of the western and eastern sector so that the two armies know each other’s positions on the ground. The two leaders need to keep their communication channels open as both their bureaucracies and militaries carry a huge historical baggage and cannot think beyond protecting their silos. The direct channel will assume further importance as the succession of the Dalai Lama is on the horizon with China expected to come up with its own candidate as it did in the case of the Panchen Lama. The two most-populated nations in the world, the countries with the first and second largest armies in the world, cannot be adversaries forever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/defusing-the-india-china-dispute/story-JZX8lbEALeBGCc2E7SSlmK.html
03-06-2020||News||Migrant workers: The emergence of invisible India||We are living in challenging times brought on by the coronavirus diseases (Covid-19). When India imposed its lockdown, everyone extended full support to the move in the belief that we need to stand as one in the fight against the virus.Now that India is opening up, it is clear that the strategy to combat the virus did not consider all Indians as one. A country of over 1.3 billion people was locked down, at four hours’ notice, ignoring the needs of the poorest and migrant workers. The government’s response came with an inherent class bias built into it. If you were an Indian abroad, the national carrier was pressed into service to fly you back, even from countries such as China, where the virus had already spread. I support this as an action any responsible country must take for its citizens stranded abroad. Yet, migrant workers, stranded away from their homes and families, found themselves out of jobs with no money or food security.I am from Padrauna in Kushinagar district in eastern Uttar Pradesh. Thousands of men leave this district every year to find work in the cities often leaving their families behind. Within days of the lockdown, Congress workers reported that many migrants from my district were stranded in different states. I set up a helpline with my team. As soon as we made the numbers public, we were deluged with calls. They all had one demand in common: Basic rations to get by. All their money had been exhausted with the overnight shutdown of factories.One of the saddest calls was from a group of young boys stuck in central UP. Left with no wages, they had pooled together and sold three mobile phones to buy food. Selling a mobile phone, the only connection with their families, has become an act of ultimate desperation to survive in these times.The Congress Working Committee and president as well as Rahul Gandhi warned the government that this was becoming a humanitarian crisis of unimaginable proportions. This was dismissed as carping by the Opposition.The irony is, we have treated migrant workers as outsiders, though they have been crucial to nation-building. Their needs were invisible to those who made grand announcements, until they came out to walk on the very streets and highways they had built, on the way back to their homes.During election campaigns, I have often gone to areas where there is a dominance of people from UP. They have all told me the same thing — they are considered outsiders who are good enough to build metros and skyscrapers, but not considered deserving even of habitable accommodations. They are outside the safety net of most state government schemes because they don’t have domicile documents.There are three constructive action points we need to consider urgently. One, we need a database of people working and living outside their states. For too long, the fact that they are working in the informal sector as contract labour has made them almost non-existent. This database would make it easier to accurately assess how many need to be given food or shelter or transported during a crisis such as this.Two, the government has now taken up the proposal put forward by the former United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government of one-nation, one-ration card. This must be taken a step further. Workers with an identity document from another state should be allowed to access all government schemes and facilities of the central government or of the state where they are currently living. Also, workers from other states must be allowed to vote where they are living. This will give them political value and access to the local elected representative. Both Aadhaar and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme are UPA government schemes. They must now be strengthened.Three, instituting labour reforms does not mean making it easier to exploit workers. We must now formulate a universal social security scheme for workers using an authentic database. In reply to a recent public interest litigation in Gujarat, the state said only 7,512 of an estimated 2.25 million migrant workers were registered. The government has no accurate estimates of the numbers of migrant workers or their locations which explains the inadequate response to their plight today.The only silver lining in a dark cloud is that India’s urban residents seem to have finally woken up to the circumstances in which many of their fellow citizens are living. They have begun to realise how much these voiceless, faceless people contribute to their lives.The most humbling conversation I have had during these last two months was with the father of a 19-year-old boy, Arjun Chauhan, who came from my district. He was killed in a road accident in Auraiya, UP, on his way home in the back of a crowded truck. His father told me his son had left his village for the first time in his young life, just a few months ago, to earn a decent living for himself and his family. Will his death be seen as a fall-out of the pandemic, the apathy of the State, or just another statistic to be forgotten? Most importantly, will it be a wake up call to India’s policy makers?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/migrant-workers-the-emergence-of-invisible-india/story-NfDyNBSpOxI45KjxnSNXML.html

Therefore, incident commanders have been appointed,” the order issued on June 1 mentioned.One official has been appointed for each of the five areas—Majri Chowk and Sector 20, near village Kundi; Sector 16/17 chowk near Budhanpur village; Gandhi Chowk, Kalka and Pinjore police station triangle; bus stand, Barwala; and Anaj Mandi, Raipur Rani.The incident commanders will check whether construction workers are registered with Haryana Building and Other Construction Workers (BOCW) Welfare Board. If yes, then whether the fortnightly welfare amount has been credited to their account, and if no, then whether the construction worker has a yellow ration card issued by the Haryana government. If they don’t have a ration card, they will get a Distress Ration Token issued to them.The incident commanders have been directed to visit the labour chowks daily till all construction workers at these chowks are covered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panchkula-dc-appoints-five-incident-commanders-to-take-care-of-daily-wage-labourers/story-1BCN5FEHpfPOe9y9kfBdAJ.html
03-06-2020||Chandigarh||Mansa court employee charged with ‘scandalising judiciary’ on YouTube||CHANDIGARHA Mansa court employee will face a trial for allegedly scandalising judiciary by posting videos criticising judges on the social networking site YouTube. The high court bench of justice Jaswant Singh and justice Sant Prakash on Wednesday framed charges against Harmeet Singh, a clerk. The employee has been accused of making a page “Ugly face of Indian Judiciary, Ludhiana” and uploading videos lambasting the judicial officers by levelling “false allegations and conveying wrong message” to the public. In the charges framed, the bench said by uploading video clips on social media, he talked about his transfer and scandalised the names of sitting judges by concocting stories of corruption, bribery and nepotism prevailing in the district judiciary, which court termed “nothing but a figment of (his) imagination”.“Uploading such videos which scandalises the whole judicial institution and particularly the names of honourable judges of this court (HC) do not come under the purview of liberty of free expression,” the bench observed adding that the move was “certainly an attack on the Judges” integrity, besides it being offensive, intimidatory and malicious.It was also stated that he uploaded videos and made statements in the media without sanction of the competent authority. The content of charges were read out before him but he pleaded not guilty, the order said. As per the reference sent to the high court for taking action against him under Contempt of Courts Act, he joined in 2009 as a clerk at district and sessions division, Ludhiana. He was posted at Jargaon but kept on pressurising for transfer to Ludhiana. Later, he was transferred to Mansa. As the posting was not of his liking, he started filing RTIs and opened an account on YouTube criticising the judges and making allegations against them, the reference says. The contempt proceedings were initiated in 2013 and in 2016 he also faced stoppage of four annual grade increments for his conduct.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mansa-court-employee-charged-with-scandalising-judiciary-on-youtube/story-Tgq6v9xPLKLZ4lPrgri7UJ.html
03-06-2020||Chandigarh||SAD not to be party to centre’s move to dilute federalism: Chandumajra||Akali leader and former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra on Wednesday said the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) would not be party to any legislation brought by the central government that erodes the powers of the states.Reacting to the centre’s announcement to virtually do away with the state agricultural marketing produce legislation, Chadumajra said the SAD was the only party in the country that consistently fought for state autonomy and made sacrifices. He added every action of the party on this sensitive issue would be dictated by that glorious history. “Any intervention by the centre will tantamount to encroachment on the rights of the states,” he said in a release.Chandumajra’s statement signals that the SAD may be upping the ante against the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), of which it is one of the oldest partners, on the issue of federalism and farmers. He said the move was skewed against the farmers in general, and Punjab in particular, whose contribution to the country’s food security continued to be the highest.The Akali leader said the governance model being implemented by the centre was exhibiting tendency towards centralisation and weakening the powers of the states vis-a-vis the centre, with the move to amend the marketing produce act its latest manifestation. “No sacrifice will be too big for the party in its endeavour to protect the rights of the state in accordance with the past struggles of the Akali Dal,” he claimed. Chandumajra added that minimum support price (MSP) system would not be allowed to be tinkered to permit unhindered operationalisation of the market forces and that would destroy the farm economy and the farmers, adding that it protected the farmers from the vagaries of the exploitative market forces.He said yet another move by the centre in this regard was interfering in the functioning of the state electricity boards with special reference to the powers of the states to sign power purchase agreements. “The centre’s move would dilute these powers. Moreover, making direct transfer of subsidy will directly harm interests of the farmers in Punjab where power is supplied free to tubewells for farm operations,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-not-to-be-party-to-centre-s-move-to-dilute-federalism-chandumajra/story-c2Qd8ZeU0qdfOcvP0mAoEO.html
03-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai on edge as first cyclone in 72 years makes landfall; trains rescheduled, thousands evacuated||Mumbai and neighbouring areas on Wednesday braced for Cyclone Nisarga as it slammed the coast with wind speeds of up to 120 kmph after tens of thousands of people in its path were evacuated, trains rescheduled, flights cancelled, fishermen ordered out of the seas and rescue workers put on standby.Nisarga blew in from the Arabian Sea, making landfall at the coastal town Alibag at around 12.30 pm and the process will finish by 4 pm, officials said. Already down on its knees from the raging Covid-19 pandemic, Mumabi will be hit by a cyclone for the first time in 72 years, Adam Soebel, a professor of atmospheric science at Columbia University in New York, tweeted. Earlier, Soebel had said the last severe cyclone to hit Mumbai was 1891 but on Wednesday corrected to say the city was hit by a cyclone in 1948. “It is likely to cross with an intensity of a severe cyclonic storm close to south of Alibag,” India Meteorological Department (IMD) Mumbai’s deputy director general of meteorology K S Hosalikar said.“At that time, its speed is likely to be 100 kmph to 110 kmph, he added.Steeped in colonial history, Alibag is a quaint little town located about 110 km from Mumbai, and is dotted with sandy beaches, unpolluted air and several forts and temples. A speedboat from Mumbai to Mandwa jetty near Alibag takes 20 minutes and is an easy option for those wishing to avoid the arduous road journey. It is also home to many Bollywood stars and other rich people. Nisarga, which is also expected to pummel the coastline of Gujarat besides Maharashtra, comes a week after Cyclone Amphan wreaked havoc in West Bengal.Hosalikar said Mumbai, Thane, Raigad and Palghar will be hit with winds of up to 100 kmph to 110 kmph. The IMD said the storm may also gust to 120 kmph. The winds will be accompanied by heavy to very heavy rainfall in the coastal districts of the state.The department has forecast the storm will have an impact on areas in North Maharashtra, Pune, Ahmednagar.The department has said kuccha houses, trees, electric poles may fall as they may not be able to withstand the speed of the storm. Pune-based Sucheta Nadkarny, 81, who lived in Mumbai suburb Vile Parle in 1948 said, “I remember huge trees in our area were uprooted and plants in our garden destroyed.“I was 10 years old then and remember this because my mother was heartbroken as the plants she had lovingly nurtured were destroyed,” Nadkarny told PTI.The state government authorities have already asked people in vulnerable areas to shift to safer places.Bracing for the impact of what is being billed as the most severe cyclone to hit Mumbai, the Central Railway (CR) rescheduled special trains and many airlines also cancelled their Mumbai operations.The CR has rescheduled, diverted and regulated some trains on Wednesday, an official said. These include five special trains departing from Mumbai. Three special trains will be either diverted or regulated enroute, he added.Maharashtra and Gujarat activated their disaster response mechanism, deploying NDRF teams and evacuating people from areas likely to be hit.As a precautionary measure, the NDRF has evacuated around 1500 people staying in a shelter at Thal near Alibag, an official said. The teams also evacuated people from Uttan and Mira Bhayandar, he added.The teams conducted a reconnaissance of Palghar and Raigad coasts early on Wednesday, the official said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Maharashtra and Gujarat chief ministers on Tuesday and assured them all possible help from the Centre.Nearly 43,000 people living near the coastline in Gujarat’s Valsad and Navsari districts have been shifted to safer places as the state prepares to face the approaching cyclonic storm, officials said.All fishing boats which were out in the sea off Palghar coast have returned, an official said.As many as 577 fishing boats from Palghar had gone out in the sea and till Monday evening, 564 came back.Later, help was sought from the Coast Guard, Navy and the fisheries department and the remaining 13 boats also returned to the shore late Tuesday evening, Palghar district disaster control chief Vivekanand Kadam said.Ten teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) have been deployed in parts of Maharashtra for rescue operations in view of the cyclonic storm, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said.An alert has been issued for Mumbai city and suburbs, Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts.Town planning authority MMRDA said nearly 150 patients at its Covid facility in Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) in Mumbai were shifted as a precaution ahead of the cyclone.The Navy has has kept five flood teams and three diving teams on stand-by in Mumbai, the official said.These teams, trained and equipped for rescue operations, are stationed at various naval areas across Mumbai and can provide early response over a larger area, he said.“We have evacuated more than 3,500 people from koliwadas (fishermen colonies) and temporary houses to safer structures like schools, community halls and government buildings,” superintendent of police Raigad, Anil Paraskar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-on-edge-as-first-cyclone-in-72-years-makes-landfall-trains-rescheduled-thousands-evacuated/story-DkoZn4igD9gLvL0FhUfm1J.html
03-06-2020||City||Gangster Sonu Kancha, aides hack rival to death in Ludhiana, injure another||Three years after a murderous attack on his brother, gangster Sonu Kancha, along with his accomplices, allegedly hacked his rival to death and injured another at Matharu Chowk in Shimlapuri on Monday night. Police have launched a manhunt after registering a case of murder against Sonu Kancha of Gobind Nagar and his accomplices, Sonu Kumar, Vijay Kumar, Jaswinder and Karan Manim Bina. Five other accomplices remain unidentified.The deceased, Ramandeep, 30, hailed from Bulara village in Ludhiana district. His friend Gagandeep Singh, 27, of Jujhar Nagar, Shimlapuri, told the police that they both were present at Matharu Chowk around 10pm on Monday night. Suddenly, several men arrived there on multiple motorcycles and attacked them with sharp-edged weapons without any provocation. Gagandeep said they raised the alarm, but no one came to their aid. It was only after the assailants left that onlookers rushed them to the local ESIC hospital, where Ramandeep succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday. A case under Sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code was registered against the accused after the death of Ramandeep.Inspector Amandeep Singh Brar, SHO, Shimlapuri police station, said both groups were old rivals.Gagandeep and Ramandeep were facing trial in various criminal cases.

Until the end of April, Yeida had allotted 14 industrial and six institutional plots to different firms and earned ₹1,375 crore during the nationwide lockdown which began on March 25. Most businesses and commercial activities were shut down across the country due to the lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The Yeida allotted around 50 acres of land to investors from March 25 to the end of April. “We were running an open-ended scheme that allows interested applicants to apply for and buy land to set up businesses without any restrictions of a deadline. We have examined the applications of several who applied and selected 14 industrial and six institutional applicants. All these units and institutional businesses will create 7,800 jobs in this region,” Arun Vir Singh, the chief executive officer of Yeida, said.The Yeida began the allotment after the Uttar Pradesh government directed all top officials to carry out the process online, instead of manually. The objective was to attract investments and create jobs in the region along the 165km Yamuna Expressway that connects Greater Noida with Agra.“We invited online applications for our plot schemes. The interested applicants sent us all their details, along with the required documents. We first examined their proposals and checked whether they would be able to set up their business within the stipulated time frame or not. And we also checked their financial status to ensure that they can create jobs in this region,” Singh said.The Yeida said that they were successful in selling because people wanted to buy land along the Yamuna Expressway as the Noida International Greenfield Airport will come up at Jewar. The work on the airport is likely to start by August 2020.“We could sell the land in this region because the airport project is coming up at Jewar. And the investors know that the airport project will boost the local economy and help set up their businesses,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/yeida-allots-land-online-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-FheZJikvq2UJZJELqZ4LJJ.html

Residents said the incident took place over the replacement of electricity meters in the society from pre-paid to post-paid, without any prior notice to the residents. Residents allege that the electricity issue in the society is an old one.“Some residents had filed a request with the power department for an audit of the builder’s (power) consumption and subsequent collection of dues from us. Due to this, people from the developer’s end had come to install 100 new post-paid meters last week but when we said that other electricity-related issues needed to be addressed as well, they left. They came back Tuesday with at least 10-12 armed goons. They misbehaved with women and threatened us. When we called the cops, they scattered while a few were rounded by the police,” Rajendra Kotnala, a resident of the society, alleged.In the complaint, filed by some women of the society, it has been alleged that the suspects misbehaved with them, pointed a pistol at them and threatened them.“Due to the lockdown, many residents were around to help us during the security threat. The whole thing happened at the behest of the CEO, after which the security in-charges threatened us,” said the complaint by the residents.The CEO did not respond to calls while the GM chose not to comment on the situation.However, Anuj Chaudhary, the director of the Panchsheel Group, said: “Certain flats did not have meters installed and our people had gone there for that purpose only. But the residents refused the installation, despite having used electricity. The CEO and GM were not even present at the spot and the residents blamed the security in-charge for pointing a pistol at them, even though that was not the case.The two arrested suspects were identified as Jitendra and Rahul.“Two other people, including the chief executive officer (CEO) and the general manager (construction) have been named in the FIR and a probe is on to verify their role in the incident, after which thorough action will be taken. Jitendra is former a CRPF personnel and also had a licensed pistol on him which has been seized, while the process to revoke the same is underway,” said Harish Chandra, deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida Zone 2.Based on it, a case was registered against the four under Indian Penal Code sections 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) and 120B (Punishment of criminal conspiracy) and relevant sections of the Arms Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/security-in-charges-of-greater-noida-west-society-held-for-harassing-women-threatening-residents/story-qRU6ANi0W9kL28hjrei0NL.html

Officials of the industries department said that earlier the premises of any such unit was to be shut for 14 days as a precautionary measure.“The directions have now come from the UP chief secretary that any industrial unit where an employee turns positive will now need to shut only for 24 hours, during which extensive sanitization and cleaning process will be taken up by the unit officials. The unit will bear the expenses. Previously, units were asked to shut for 14 days as a precautionary measure,” said Virendra Kumar, deputy commissioner (industries).The Ghaziabad district has presence of about 27,000 industrial units, including 5,024 small, 149 medium and 45 heavy industrial units. The rest are under micro category and also include those in service sectors like salons, beauty parlours, consultants and architects, among others.“We have about 17,000 units which have opened up after the lockdown relaxations were announced. Presently, there are about 3.5 lakh workers who have started working. So, the directions received from the government will help the units as they don’t need to shut down for long. On recommendation of the health department we have also asked the units to get tested their workers through the health department,” Kumar said.He further said Covid-19 positive cases have emerged from two units in Sahibabad Industrial Area so far.Owners of the industrial units in Ghaziabad have taken a sigh of relief and said that they are also taking every precautionary measures, such as sanitization of premises and thermal screening of workers.“The units have been able to open after a long time, and the unit owners are taking every precaution.

The UP government has already procured 41 such machines while 34 more will arrive in the next three-four days.“The machine will help us test samples and give report within an hour. We expect that testing operations with Truenat will start by the end of this week. If deployed for 24 hours in three shifts, we will be able to test in-house about 50-60 samples per day,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.The Ghaziabad district at present has no testing facility and is dependent on labs in Noida, Meerut or Delhi. “Our daily average sampling capacity is about 250-300, while sampling done by private laboratories is about 75-100 samples per day. Since cases are rising and three major areas of Khoda, Loni and Vaishali are also under sealing, we need more testing to be taken up. The Truenat machine will be very helpful,” Gupta said.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has approved the use of Truenat, which is used to test tuberculosis (TB), for conducting Covid-19 tests.According to official data till Tuesday night, the Ghaziabad district had taken 10,487 samples while reports of 467 were pending. The total samples taken up also include samples taken by private labs.UP government officials said that the chief minister has stressed on increasing the testing capabilities to 15,000 against 10,000 at presen. “Truenat machines have been procured.

The minister had also met Ghaziabad officials on Monday and inspected a tertiary care facility in the district on Tuesday where he spoke to several patients, district and health officials, and doctors.Doctors from both Covid-19 tertiary care hospitals -- Meerut Medical College and Santosh Medical College, Ghaziabad -- say they had taken utmost precautions, including social distancing, during the minister’s visit. They, however, advised all those who were at the hospital at the time to quarantine themselves.The time between exposure to the virus and developing symptoms is usually five to six days but can range between one to 14 days as well. During this time, the infected person could infect others as well.“At the Meerut Medical College, The minister met people admitted in a holding area, which is a ward created for those who may have the virus and were awaiting test results. As per our knowledge, the minister was there for a couple of minutes. He later went to Ghaziabad. When the daily test reports arrived on Tuesday night, two persons from the same ward tested positive, while a third from a nearby ward also tested positive,” said Dr. Raj Kumar, the chief medical officer (CMO) of Meerut. He said that there were others along with the minister, including those from the media in the ward that had at least six people at the time.“There is little possibility of infection as we had asked all those who visited the ward to take precautions. They were asked to take precautions for 5-6 days in case they show any symptoms. They have been asked to stay in home quarantine. Officials from Lucknow also contacted the district authorities and have taken note about the minister’s visit,” Kumar said.The next day, Khanna headed to the Ghaziabad hospital near Old Bus Stand. He was accompanied by Ghaziabad district magistrate, the chief medical officer along with other officers and staff members of the hospital.“The minister stayed for about two hours at the hospital but every precaution was taken. After the issue at Meerut came to light on Wednesday, we are also cautious and keeping a tab on patients’ health. We have told those who were present at the hospital to report to us in case they show any symptom,” said Dr. NK Gupta, CMO of Ghaziabad. After this, Khanna left for Lucknow. PPE kits found dumped at DasnaOn Wednesday, the UP pollution control board (UPPCB) issued show cause to the officials of the Dasna Nagar Panchayat after personal protection equipment (PPE) were found dumped at an open dumping ground.“The teams of administration along with those from pollution board and the health department went for inspection. Normally, PPE kits come under the category of bio-medical waste and an outsourcing agency is already collecting from government and private establishments. So the reason of PPE kits lying dumped in Dasna is being inquired,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.Following the inspection, the officials of the UPPCB said that they have decided to issue show cause to the executive officer of Dasna Nagar Panchayat.“During inspection we found two PPE kits which were disposed off at the dumping ground. Our teams went there for inspection. In the meantime we are issuing show cause,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB.Dasna authorities said that the two PPE kits were found disposed near Usman Colony in Dasna and the area has no habitation.“The dumpinig ground is in isolated area. During inspection, I myself went to the location. There were two PPE kits but these were found to be unused ones. We suspect that these could be sampling kits thrown here by some unidentified persons. All biomedical waste and even those from the facility quarantine centres in Dasna is being collected by an agency and safely disposed of.The officials from the quarantine centres also inspected the site,” said Manoj Kumar Mishra, executive officer of Dasna Nagar Panchayat. “We will be replying to the show cause issued by the UPPCB. In the meantime we have disposed off the PPE kits, found in Dasna, as per norms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hours-after-up-minister-met-patients-in-meerut-hospital-three-test-positive-for-virus/story-b4onnShkeZLyZOklhANz8L.html
03-06-2020||Delhi||120 eateries, guest houses, banquets in Delhi wait for fire dept clearance to operate||Around 120 establishments in Delhi — restaurants, guest houses and banquet halls — have run out of validity to operate as their no-objection certificates (NoC) have lapsed and the owners are not being able to renew their documents due to the Covid-19 lockdown.To get their NoCs renewed, the operators have approached the Delhi Fire Services, which says it cannot carry out a mandatory clearance inspection till all lockdown restrictions are lifted. The department advised people to make sure the banquet halls or guest houses they have booked had renewed permission to hold functions.All such facilities in Delhi are required to have basic firefighting norms to operate. After a detailed inspection, the Delhi Fire Services issues them a NoC , which is valid for three years.To ensure safety measures are in place, the fire department checks for a particular width of exit staircases, at least two entrances and exits in case of an emergency, restricted number of seating as per the space available, no blocked passages and arrangements for basic firefighting equipment, etc.A senior fire officer, who wished not to be named, said they get renewal requests throughout the year. “Many banquet halls and guest houses have said they have bookings for weddings and requested for the NoC. But since the lockdown was imposed in March, our department is not dealing in public services due to government restrictions and so no inspections have been conducted nor NoCs issued. 120 requests are pending with us,” the officer said. All these facilities are shut not at present because of the lockdown. “Once restrictions are lifted, they will have to stay shut till their NoCs are renewed. We advise people to make sure the places they are booking are valid permission to organise functions,” the officer said. Atul Garg, director of Delhi Fire Services, confirmed that 120 establishments could not be inspected due to the lockdown. “The number of requests for NoC renewal is expected to rise till the time lockdown is in force,” Garg said.Anshu Tandon, president of the Khan Market welfare association, said the New Delhi Municipal Council had two days ago told a few restaurants to obtain NoCs from the Delhi department or face action. Khan Market has 35 restaurants, out of which only four have valid NoCs at present.“It is a double whammy. Our restaurants are shut and the fire department is not issuing any clearance. The pendency is so much, it will be difficult for the fire department to give us our clearances on time,” he said.Tandon said this was harassment as restaurants with a seating capacity of less than 50 do not need a fire clearance. “This is why just four of our restaurants have NoCs from the fire department at present,, he said.Dinesh Arora, president of the Delhi restaurants association, suggested that NoCs can be issued online. “If government lifts restrictions tomorrow, many of us will still not be able to function because of pending NoCs. We have already suffered losses . The government should allow us to operate either without fire NoC or expedite the process of inspection by issuing NoCs online,” Arora said. In Connaught Place alone, Arora said, there are at least 70-80 restaurants that are waiting for the green light.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/120-eateries-guest-houses-banquets-in-delhi-wait-for-fire-dept-clearance-to-operate/story-1LTJfBVIv0q9fT0Q5mHbjM.html

03-06-2020||City||Traffic crawls at Delhi-Ghaziabad border as cops screen all vehicles for passes||Ghaziabad: Thousands of commuters were caught in a long traffic jam at the Delhi-Ghaziabad border due to the strict checking by the police on Wednesday. The snarls, say commuters, began around 9am and led to long tailbacks that stretched to the internal roads of Ghaziabad.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said Delhi borders will be sealed for a week. Ghaziabad has put in similar restrictions since April 22, citing a rising number of Covid-19 cases in the district which were linked to city residents who travelled to Delhi.“I came to drop off my wife who goes to Delhi by carpool. But we got stuck as there is heavy jam from UP Gate up to Dabur crossing on the Link Road and also up to Gaur Green Avenue in Indirapuram on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway. The police were checking every vehicle, which led to the snarls,” Jeevan Singh, a resident of Vasundhara, said.Dr Swati Sinha, a resident of Indirapuram, who works as a senior consultant with a hospital in Qutub Institutional Area in Delhi, said she was stuck up for about two and half hours and had to return home on Wednesday morning.“My patient was waiting at the hospital for a surgery scheduled at 11am. But I was stuck in the jam at the border till 11.30am. So I handed over the patient to another doctor and returned home. The jam on Wednesday took me by surprise as traffic was smooth on the other days. There was also some road work going on near the Hindon canal. I generally move out by 8am but today I left at 9am and got stuck,” she said.The Ghaziabad police said the checking of vehicles by the Delhi Police led to traffic jams on the UP side.“The Delhi Police are checking vehicles at the border and the traffic movement was slow. We had long queues on the Ghaziabad side. On our side, we are checking vehicles which are entering Ghaziabad from Delhi,” Anshu Jain, circle officer (Indirapuram), said.Delhi Police said they intensified checking on Wednesday after getting complaints that no checking was being done. “Initially, we were only checking vehicles intermittently to spare commuters the inconvenience. But when many complaints were received that no checking was being done at the border, we put up barricades and increased the checking. That caused long snarls. Later, we relaxed the checking to avoid further congestion,” deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said.Some of the commuters who left Ghaziabad for Delhi early morning said there were no checks around 7.30am.“I crossed the UP Gate border around 7.30m and there were no checks either on the Ghaziabad or the Delhi side. There was less traffic and I reached my office within 45 minutes. The National Highways Authority of India is also undertaking repair work on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME) and this has also added to jams near UP Gate,” Kuldeep Saxena, Indirapuram resident, said.Among vehicles stranded in the gridlock were ambulances destined for Delhi.“I am carrying a critical patient to AIIMS from UP’s Sambhal. Our entire journey till Indirapuram was smooth. But from there onwards, the traffic was thick. We got stuck in the jam for more than 45 minutes,” the ambulance driver, who refused to share his name, said.The NHAI officials said the jams were not due to DME work but due to barricading at the border area of NH-9.“According to our estimates, there is about 80,000 PCUs (passenger car units) at UP Gate on Wednesday, which is just one fourth the traffic on a normal day. The volume is the same at our toll at Chhajarsi (at Pilkhuwa town in Hapur). Our road has full capacity to cater to the traffic and our works have not hampered movement of vehicles. It is because of barricading and checks taken up by the Delhi and UP police,” Garg said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/traffic-crawls-at-delhi-ghaziabad-border-as-cops-screen-all-vehicles-for-passes/story-PQH1QRJ6gLZzGYcA9CLBPM.html

It’s much more efficient than walks in parks or gyms where it might not be possible to keep people at a distance. The idea was to highlight how important it is to stay healthy so that it boosts immunity while also ensuring ways to keep us safe from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19),” Dharmendra Kumar Sharma, a resident of Sector 34, who was a part of the cycling crew, said.The group started cycling from Sector 50 and rode all the way to the Sector 145 Metro station via the Noida-Greater Noida expressway and back, covering the 30-kilometre distance in an hour-and-a-half.“During these times, social distancing is the key to staying safe. Staying at home for more than two months has further highlighted the importance of health and fitness, and cycling is a sport which ensures both social distancing and fitness. It’s environment friendly and improves both lung and brain health, decreases stress and improves joint mobility,” Rajiva Singh, a resident of Sector 50, said.Residents said that even wearing a mask while cycling does not feel like a hindrance.The group said it hopes to get together repeatedly on weekends for similar outings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-residents-get-together-to-cycle-for-a-healthier-lifestyle/story-KBImTWCh4PYEY8fIOtiNIM.html

03-06-2020||Delhi||Oppn targets govt over Covid app, govt calls it important tool||A day after the Delhi government launched a mobile application to provide information about the number of vacant hospital beds in the city, several users complained that hospitals denied them admission despite the application showing vacant beds.While the Congress and the BJP alleged that the government was misleading the people, a Delhi government spokesperson said that the hospitals were supposed to provide status of vacant beds. “If the hospitals do not admit patients despite beds being available, the government will take immediate action,” the spokesperson added. The spokesperson conceded “teething problems” in the application but termed it an “extremely useful tool for the citizens”. “Over the next few days, we aim to provide real-time information to everyone,” the spokesperson said. Delhi Congress president Anil Chaudhary released a video, showing a retired municipal worker being denied admission to Max Hospital, Patparganj, despite the mobile app showing available beds. “Angoori Devi is a retired municipal worker, who lives in Patparganj Village. The family took her to the hospital after checking bed availability on the app. When they reached there, they were told that no beds were available,” Chaudhary said.Shankar Mehrauliya, Devi’s nephew, said the hospital staff showed him a screen at the reception which showed that there were no beds for Covid-19 or even non-Covid patients. “We kept requesting for admission, but nothing happened,” Mehrauliya said.In an email response to HT regarding the allegation, Max Healthcare Institute said its Patparganj wing had commissioned 80 beds (29 in ICU and 51 ward beds) dedicated to treat Covid-19 patients on May 29.“... These beds were fully occupied within three days. Yesterday (Tuesday) night, all beds in the hospital were occupied. For the convenience of patients, we have installed screens at the hospital, reflecting the occupancy of Covid beds. We are trying our best to accommodate as many patients as possible in the hospital and are also appealing to patients with minor symptoms to self-quarantine at home,” the Institute said in the statement. In another instance, a Delhi-based journalist tweeted that his brother, who showed severe Covid symptoms, had to be shuttled between hospitals because the government portal showed bed availability but the hospitals said there were none. “My brother has severe Covid symptoms. We contacted Max, Apollo and Gangaram—all three said no beds. But your website shows they have beds. Please look into this,” tweeted the journalist, Vikas Pandey.A senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader responded to Pandey’s tweet, offering assistance, while another replied to the SOS and asked the journalist to report the hospital, denying admission to the government helpline 1031.Another Twitter user, Naman S Kedia, claimed in a tweet that while the government app showed 56 beds vacant on Tuesday afternoon, the hospital denied availability. “We have a Covid positive patient and we contacted Max Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, which, as per Delhi coronavirus app, had 56 beds vacant. But on calling them (the hospital) they said there were no beds vacant. What do we do?” Kedia tweeted.Max Healthcare Institute maintained that all the information on bed availability was being displayed in their hospitals. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta on Wednesday said that the party conducted a “reality check”, wherein four of the seven hospitals on the app were not admitting Covid-19 patients. The remaining three hospitals reported they were full.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/oppn-targets-govt-over-covid-app-govt-calls-it-important-tool/story-H289Oul6WM5E20yLTeQcmK.html

03-06-2020||City||132 test Covid-19 positive, poor case reporting in past adding to figures: Health dept||Gurugram: The district on Tuesday registered 132 new Covid-19 cases, the second highest single-day spike in a week. The total count of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus has reached 1,195. Of these, 903 are active cases, health department officials said. The previous highest spike was reported on Tuesday when 160 new cases were confirmed.On Wednesday, four people were discharged, while the death toll stood at four, according to the state health bulletin. Official data shows that the district, which accounts for about 40% of Haryana’s total tally of 2,954 cases, has the highest Covid-19 burden in the state till now. The sudden spike in coronavirus cases in Gurugram started from May 28 when 68 cases were reported, taking the total count to 407. In the following six days, 790 cases were added, which has been the highest increase in a week till now. DATA INACCURACYThe state and district health officials initially claimed that the sudden spike in positive cases was due to ease in lockdown, leading to intermingling of infected and non-infected persons. On Tuesday, however, they raised the issue of data inaccuracy, with state home minister Anil Vij writing a letter to Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan.Vij in his letter said that the labs in Delhi, which are taking Covid-19 samples of Haryana residents, are not sharing reports properly with the authorities concerned, resulting in delay of contact tracing and surveillance activities, besides creating mismatch on website of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and state portal.At least nine to 10 labs in Delhi have taken samples of Gurugram residents, the officials said. On May 31, the Director General Health Services (DGHS), Haryana, issued notices to 18 private labs of Delhi, approved by ICMR for doing Covid-19 testing in the national capital, for taking samples of Haryana patients without keeping the Haryana health department in the loop. Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, said, “These labs were not conveying results to concerned district health authorities. In many cases, incomplete or wrong addresses or incorrect contact details were shared, which has a direct consequences on the surveillance activities. We have strongly taken up the issue of data inaccuracies.”The district health department also confirmed that at least 300 new cases reported last week are mostly the backlog cases which have been uploaded by the private labs in the last few days. Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer, said, “Most of the private labs were doing incomplete entries in the portal or putting incomplete addresses. There are at least nine to 10 labs in Delhi which have taken samples of Gurugram residents and have not shared the test results timely. Now, they are putting up the data, which is adding up to the overall figure.”The state health department accepted that the delay in sharing test results has impacted contact tracing and surveillance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/132-test-covid-19-positive-poor-case-reporting-in-past-adding-to-figures-health-dept/story-T6HhD9NJEK17Wt3FXjRYjM.html
03-06-2020||Gurugram||Private hospitals start homecare packages for Covid-19 patients||Private hospitals in the city are reaching out to Covid-19 patients to provide extensive care during their home isolation. As more than 54% such patients in the city are isolated at home at present, the hospitals have introduced homecare packages where patients are monitored 24x7 by nurses and doctors through video calls.The private hospitals are also offering to deliver medicines and safety gears at the doorstep of such patients, and if required sample collection too. Even how to wear and dispose of a personal protection equipment (PPE) kit is being taught to caregivers. For 14-17 days of isolation period, the health facilities are providing comprehensive medical care under these packages, which may cost anything between Rs 4,900 and Rs 25,000.As per the protocol, after a patient and the district health department receive the test results from a diagnostic lab, the local health team suggests home isolation if there are no or mild symptoms. Only after a written consent from the patient, he/she is allowed to be isolated at home. Such patient can depend upon the monitoring by the district health team or opt for the homecare packages introduced by various private hospitals. “Under our home isolation support programme, the patient who is asymptomatic can isolate themselves at home with complete training and education on ‘How to live in home isolation’ with information education system. The patient can avail doctor’s consultation through video or call who will monitor the patient’s medical needs,” said Dr Ritu Garg, zonal director, Fortis Memorial Research Institute.She said that their consultants are available 24x7 on call in case the symptoms vary, and the patient requires medical attention or hospitalization. Also, the hospital allows patients to consult a nutritionist or a psychologist and avail a tele-rehabilitation call. Earlier this week, Medanta hospital also started 17-day remote homecare package. At least 75 patients are availing the service under the package. It includes daily monitoring of patients by nurses trained in handling Covid-19 cases. Through video calls, doctors review patients on every fourth or fifth day. It starts on the 3rd day of the home isolation, then 7th day, followed by 12th and 17th day. Dr Sushila Katariya, who has been handling Covid-19 patients at Medanta hospital since March, said, “At least 75 patients are availing our package. A team of five doctors decide whether a patient can be isolated at home or not. Then we communicate with them, guiding them to take daily vitals and feeding it on our online system. We are available 24x7 for patients.”Adding that patients have anxiety issues while in home isolation, Katariya said, “Most of them report breathlessness due to anxiety issues. We ask specific questions like do they face difficulties in walking even 10 steps. Sometimes, they ask whether home isolation is legal or can two Covid-19 positive patients stay in a room. Even they ask how to dispose of the waste. Everyday queries are addressed so that patients do not panic.” According to her, home isolation is the best way to cure until patients show critical signs.On Wednesday, Artemis Hospital also shared a 14-day personal caregiver package on their website and social media account. A representative of the hospital said, “The services are starting from today. We are providing 24x7 dedicated care by doctors which includes medical advice and psychological support, monitoring of vital parameters and timely support for a quick recovery.”All these hospitals are guiding patients to use equipment like pulse oximetre to check pulse rate, blood pressure machine and glucometer. If required, these devices are provided at doorstep of the patient as a part of the package. They also provide masks, gloves, and PPE kits. Fortis hospital is providing disposable crockery and bio medical waste management bags on request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/private-hospitals-start-homecare-packages-for-covid-19-patients/story-7OxKfkconGpI0apL4vksdK.html
03-06-2020||Gurugram||Govt allows sports complexes, stadiums with safeguards||The state government on Wednesday allowed athletes to train and take part in other related activities in sports complexes and stadia across Haryana, while strictly adhering to the standard operating procedures (SOP) issued by the Central government for the containment of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.A spokesperson of the sports and youth affairs department said that trainees shall be allowed to train/practice between 5am and 9pm.“Gymnasiums and swimming pools at these complexes will not be allowed to reopen in any circumstances. Trainers and coaches need to take heat conditions into account when designing a training programme,” the spokesperson said. The spokesperson further said that neither spectators nor any event/function will be allowed in sports stadia/ complexes until further directions.The government also directed district sports and youth affairs officers to ensure that social distancing is followed at sports venues under their jurisdiction. Sanitiser should be made available at every place as per requirements and all officers, trainers and trainees should wear masks. The spokesperson further said that officers concerned have been asked to ensure strict compliance of these guidelines.Raj Yadav, district sports officer, Gurugram, said that the Nehru Sports Stadium in the city was reopened earlier on May 21 with restrictions. But a Covid-19 case was reported and the stadium had to be closed as a preventive measure. “The stadium will be opened next Monday. All measures pertaining to social distancing will be practised,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/govt-allows-sports-complexes-stadiums-with-safeguards/story-Bv6R8welNUFrQ0l7mLy7YP.html
03-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab crosses 1 lakh test-mark, focus now on frontline warriors||With Punjab on Wednesday crossing the mark of 1 lakh Covid-19 tests since the pandemic outbreak in the state, the health department said its top priority now is to get all frontline workers tested as they are at higher risk of contracting the virus. Earlier, only symptomatic doctors, paramedics and ASHA workers besides pregnant health department staff members were being tested for the infection. Besides, sanitation workers and police personnel on frontline duties will also be tested in the coming days whether they are symptomatic or not.The state government is planning to carry out at least 6,000 tests a day as it now has a daily capacity of conducting 9,000 tests. “The main reason behind testing frontline workers is the amount of risk involved. In case anyone gets virus and is not tested, they can become super spreader as they come in contact with many people while performing their duties,” Punjab’s Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said. The health department is also planning to screen all aanganwadi workers and carry out tests of those with having history of serious ailments. These workers have been conducting door-to-door Covid-19 surveys.A senior health department official said 17 government departments have been asked to prepare lists of employees deployed on frontline duties as 4,000 daily tests, including pool tests, will be carried out of such workers.50,000 TESTS IN PAST 20 DAYSOf the more than 1.01 lakh Covid-19 tests conducted in Punjab so far, 50,000 were done in the past 20 days, figures reveal. Maximum 4,327 tests were done in a single day on May 30.The neighboring Haryana, which on June 1 surpassed Punjab in the total number of positive cases, conducted 1.26 lakh tests till Wednesday morning. Till May 1, only 23,176 tests were conducted in the state, with the Government Medical College (GMC), Amritsar, being the first to start testing in the last week of March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-crosses-1-lakh-test-mark-focus-now-on-frontline-warriors/story-3uCkEwUuOPnaVKalpCQz1O.html
03-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram officials to ascertain if workers received financial assistance, compile data||To ensure that financial assistance and other relief measures reach construction labourers and migrant workers, the Haryana government has asked the district administrations and labour departments in the state to form local committees and reach out to them. The government directed that in case these workers have not received help, then labour officials should register them at the earliest with the Construction Labour Welfare Board. It has also asked the local authorities to compile district-wise data in this regard. Haryana chief secretary Keshni Anand Arora on Monday, while presiding over a meeting of the crisis coordination committee, said that as per the instructions of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, the local-level committees and respective deputy commissioners (DCs) should contact the labourers, who gather at labour chowks in search of work and find out whether they are registered with the Construction Labour Welfare Board. “If not, they should be registered under the unorganised sector and local committees to ensure ration is distributed to them,” Arora said, adding that the local administration should also inquire from the labourers whether they have received the state’s financial assistance (ranging between ₹2,000 and ₹5,000) during the last two months of the pandemic. Arora also asked the DCs to compile the data and upload the labourers’ latest mobile numbers on the portal of the labour department.The directions issued by the state government assume significance because Gurugram is one of the largest real estate and construction hubs not only in the state but across the national capital region.There were around 2.5 to 3 lakh construction workers in Gurugram before the lockdown, who worked on real estate projects. Of these, around 1.5 to 2 lakh have already left the city, local trade union leaders associated with the construction industry say. The city has around 11 large labour chowks where labourers would gather in large numbers in the morning to look for various kinds of construction and other civic works, but now the number of workers gathering there post-lockdown has gone down considerably. The prominent labour chowks in the city are at Railway Road Chowk, Bhuteshwar Mandir Chowk, sector 21/22 Crossing, Hero Honda Chowk, Bhardwaj Chowk near Qadipur, Sikanderpur Metro Station, Sector 56/57, Wazirabad and South City 1.“Around 1.5 to 2 lakh construction workers have already left for home as they did not have money to pay rent or buy essential items like food. I have not come across any worker who received financial help from the government. If they had got money, why would they leave?” Rajender Saroha, joint secretary, Bhawan Nirmaan Kamgar Union, said.Saroha, however, said that government should compile the data and release the names of workers who have received financial or any other kind of assistance from the construction welfare board so everyone would come to know who received money, if at all. “This is an exercise on paper and will remain hidden in the government files. We will see how many workers are actually contacted by officials,” he said.The district labour department, however, said that they are taking steps to help migrant workers. “We are taking several steps to help the labour and construction workers. Around 1.25 lakh workers are registered with the department and those eligible have been granted financial assistance of ₹5,000. The direct transfer of money takes place via a centralised system from Chandigarh,” Ravinder Malik, the deputy director, (IS&H) labour department, said.Gurugram deputy commissioner Amit Khatri said that labour committees are already in place and have now been activated to get information from the workers in this regard. “We will soon have feedback on the assistance given to workers and efforts will be made to register those workers who are still not covered by the welfare board,” he added.Additional labour commissioner Munish Sharma said that work on helping the labourers is going on and all steps are being taken to ensure that assistance reaches everyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-officials-to-ascertain-if-workers-received-financial-assistance-compile-data/story-zgu14e3ecnLojaZ8SnbfrL.html
03-06-2020||Chandigarh||Man booked for killing wife, nephew in Rupnagar||A man has been booked for killing his wife and nephew with a sharp-edged weapon on the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday. The accused has been identified as Alam, a resident of ward no 1 on Sugar Mill road, who consumed a poisonous substance after committing the crime and is currently admitted to the local government hospital, police said.The deceased have been identified as Kajal, 28, and Sahil, 12. Kajal’s younger sister Jaspreet alias Jassi and Sahil’s brother Bobby, 15, were also injured in the attack and referred to Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh.According to Kajal’s mother Babli, the accused was staying with them after marriage. She alleged that he and Kajal had a strained relationship and Alam used to quarrel with her over petty issues.She said that at around 1.30 am, Alam first killed his wife with a sharp-edged weapon and then attacked Jassi and Sahil and Bobby, the sons of her eldest daughter, Sweety, who was not at home.A case has been registered under Sections 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder) of Indian Penal Code (IPC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/man-booked-for-killing-wife-nephew-in-rupnagar/story-bSBVZb6G5CXzCVkTh8HcWN.html
03-06-2020||Gurugram||More than 54% Covid-19 patients in Gurugram under home isolation||Gurugram has seen a surge in number of people testing positive for Covid-19 in the last six days, with the total number of cases breaching the 1,000 mark on June 2.Around, 54% of the active Covid-19 cases, according to data available with Gurugram administration, are under home isolation, and 9% patients are in government paid isolation facilities. According to the district health department, only 32% patients are under treatment at private and government hospitals.According to data available till June 2, of the 1,063 Covid-19 cases in the district, 775 were still active. Out of these, only 252 patients are hospitalized, while the remaining 523 are in home isolation or in government paid facilities — like hotels and guest houses. Health officials said that nearly 80% of the patients infected with Covid-19 are asymptomatic and therefore can stay in home isolation. The challenge, however, is inadequate public health infrastructure — with less than 300 beds being allocated for Covid-19 patients in the district at government hospitals — and dependency upon private hospitals, who in the past have shown reluctance in admitting patients afflicted with the virus. The private hospitals started admitting only a limited number Covid patients, after the district administration issued orders earlier this week stating they cannot turn away or refer Covid-19 patients. Currently, hospital beds in government and private hospitals are reserved only for patients who show symptoms of the virus and have underlining health issues. It is in the last five days, cases have rapidly increased in the city — by almost 235% according to the district health department’s estimate — as compared to last week. Though some of them are backlog cases, which have been updated in the last few days, Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer of the district, confirmed that the cases were increasing . “Cases are increasing by the hundreds every day. This will continue to be the new norm.”“As most of the patients are asymptomatic, we are advising home isolation. Hospital care is only for those who have symptoms and co-morbidity issues, like hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. At least 252 Covid-19 patients are admitted in 21 hospitals, including ESIC hospital,” said Punia.According to him, 25 teams in different primary health centres will contact those under home isolation in their areas to monitor their recovery. “On the first day of isolation, health workers — like an ASHA worker or a medical officer — will visit the house of the patient. Then on every third day, these health workers will visit or call the patient’s house to check if there is any deterioration of symptoms and to check if home isolation protocols are being followed,” he said.According to Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, teams will enquire about the patients’ health for at least 17 days through telephonic calls. The home isolation will be over if there is no onset of symptoms, like fever and cold, for 10 days. HOSPITAL FACILITY: A CHALLENGE In Gurugram, in the absence of proper public healthcare system, both the health department and the administration depend on private hospitals. According to the health department, at least 21 hospitals in the city have accommodated almost 100 patients, while remaining 150 are admitted in government’s ESIC Hospital and Medeor Hospital.In the government set up, there are 100 beds in ESIC hospital, 31 beds in Sector 31 polyclinic, almost 100 in Covid-19 care facility in Sector 9, which was earlier a quarantine centre and 60 beds in Medeor Hospital, Manesar. The administration and health department have been asked to reserve at least 1,000-bed for coronavirus patients in different hospitals, out of which 500 should have oxygen equipment and 100 must have ventilators. “We are coordinating with private hospitals for this,” said Punia.The decision to increase the hospital facility was taken on May 7, when the cases were just 117. The district administration roped in six private hospitals to add 600 beds to the existing capacity for the treatment of patients. But district health officials privy to the matter, said that hospitals were reluctant to take Covid-19 patients. On May 25, Gurugram deputy commissioner, Amit Khatri had issued a revised order making it mandatory for all private hospitals and nursing homes to treat Covid-19 patients who require critical health services. On May 28 and 29, notices were served to three private hospitals for flouting the order.“There are 21 private hospitals who have been asked to admit patients, while we are trying to increase the bed capacity of Medeor hospital to 120,” said Punia. Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, last Thursday had issued an order for self-paid and government paid isolation facility. “People who do not have requisite space at home can opt for facilities such as hotels and guest houses,” reads the order. While those tested positive in containment zones and want to be treated at home will have to give a written consent.Ajay Gupta, vice president, Indian Medical Association (Gurugram) said, “Small hospitals and nursing homes should be exempted from taking Covid-19 patients as they lack infrastructure, equipment and safety gears. Chances of infection are more in such hospitals. Like Delhi, tertiary care hospitals in the city should reserve at least some percentage of their total bed capacity for infected persons. Currently, that is not happening. And, the capacity of the government designated Covid-19 hospital should be increased to 100-bed at least.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/more-than-54-covid-19-patients-in-gurugram-under-home-isolation/story-vyqC8BypmhFZJO3iekvFgL.html
03-06-2020||Gurugram||Monsoon preparation takes a hit as Covid-19 works given higher priority||Authorities are running out of time to make preparations for the upcoming monsoon, which may lead to waterlogging and subsequent traffic snarls at key points of the city. Tenders for desilting drains are pending in some areas while allocated works are going on at a slow pace due to labour shortage.Over the years, waterlogging has been a major problem for Gurugram due to overflow of drains and the city being located downhill from the Aravallis. In 2016, commuters were stuck on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway for 20 hours, with the incident since being referred to as Gurujam.The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is responsible for the maintenance of master drains, while the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) undertakes the maintenance of arterial drains. Master drains carry sewage or stormwater from two or more residential sectors, while arterial drains is a network within an area or sector.GMDA and MCG are facing issues to undertake the pre-monsoon preparations.From March 21 till April 15, MCG had directed its officials to concentrate solely on ensuring basic services, such as sanitation, water, sewage, and streetlights, due to the Covid-19 outbreak. An order had restricted officials from taking up other works until further notice.It was only on April 15 during a video conference between senior MCG officials and councillors that a decision was taken to start allocation of tenders, via e-tendering, for cleaning and desilting of drains.The first set of tenders was allotted by MCG to contractors in the first week of May. However, tenders for a few areas remain pending. Contractors who have been allotted tenders say that work is progressing at a slow pace due to lack of manpower, as a large number of migrant workers have returned to their home states.“We have identified critical waterlogging points across the city and have initiated remedial measures there. Our focus this year is to ensure that rainwater does not accumulate at any point for more than 30 minutes,” said Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG.A senior MCG official privy to the matter said that the period between March 21 and April 15, when no drainage work could be initiated, has severely impacted preparedness measures.“We cannot start desilting preparations in January or February as the drains may once again clog with silt. It is in the March-May period that the bulk of cleaning operations is initiated. We lost more than a month due to the concentration of resources for dealing with Covid-19 and ensuring basic municipal services continue. The best case scenario is that 40-45% of the total drains under MCG will be desilted before monsoon,” the official said.GMDA, on the other hand, has a bit more of a head start, as it had floated tenders for cleaning drains in key waterlogging-prone stretches — the Golf Course Road, Southern Peripheral Road (SPR), Golf Course Extension Road, Jwala Mill Road, Old Delhi-Road, and Shankar Chowk Marg — in January and allotted tenders in the first week of March.However, tenders for cleaning drains along a few key stretches remain in the works. Tenders for the Iffco Chowk-Rajiv Chowk stretch, located along the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, was floated on May 19, while tenders for the Subhash Chowk-Vatika Chowk stretch on Sohna Road and the Bakhtawar Chowk-Subhash Chowk-Sector 34 marble market (located near Hero Honda Chowk) stretch were floated on May 27, with the opening of bids to be conducted on June 12.“Although we are better prepared than last year, we are not in the ideal position that we expected to be in. We had expected to clean some sewer lines and desilt a few stormwater drains before the arrival of monsoon in certain areas, which we will not be able to complete in time due to the lockdown and subsequent shortage of workers,” said VS Kundu, chief executive officer (CEO), GMDA.Kundu said that GMDA is better prepared in comparison to last year as more critical waterlogging points have been identified. “Over the last three months, every time it rained, both the MCG and GMDA officials concerned, with flood control management, were asked to travel around the city and mark every single point where there was a heavy accumulation of rainwater and also identify the reason behind it. Hence, we have a larger database of critical waterlogging points in comparison to last year to concentrate our resources,” said Kundu.Similar to last year, GMDA and MCG have agreed to work together to clean drains across the city.On Friday, during a meeting at PWD rest house in Civil Lines, the two identified as many as 79 key waterlogging points across the city, each of which will be monitored by CCTV cameras by officials who will be fixed the responsibility.Last year, there were 44 key waterlogging-prone spots identified by GMDA and MCG.This year, the two have also formed a WhatsApp group to share information and send alerts to its respective officials about waterlogging points so that a rapid action team from GMDA’s flood control room can be sent to the spot immediately for resolution. The team will either unclog or channel accumulated rainwater towards a different path, said officials.GMDA’s flood control room is equipped with dewatering pump sets, tractor-mounted suction pumps, earthmovers, super sucker machines and gunny bags to resolve waterlogging-related problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/monsoon-preparation-takes-a-hit-as-covid-19-works-given-higher-priority/story-TyhOS1FZiDpyT6jzL3pcWO.html

03-06-2020||Chandigarh||Private schools in Chandigarh barred from hiking fee this year||Amid a series of protests by parents against collection of tuition fee, the Chandigarh administration on Wednesday invoked provisions of the Disaster Management Act to rein in private schools. Now, no private school in Chandigarh can increase the fee for the current academic year. Also, they can charge only tuition fee, at the same rates as in 2019-2020. The schools have also been told to display details of the fee structure, specifically tuition fee, as per provisions of the Fee Regulation Act, 2016, on their websites and intimate the administration by June 15. The orders have been issued by UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida under Section 39 (i) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The orders effect 77 private schools in the city, which have over 1 lakh students. Earlier, the principal education secretary had issued orders deferring collection of fee in view of the Covid-19 lockdown. After schools protested, schools were allowed to collect only tuition fee.Schools had been questioning the earlier two orders, arguing that only the fee regulatory authority can issue any such direction, that too if it finds any infirmity with the school’s decision. The matter is still pending in the Punjab and Haryana high court, where schools have challenged the UT’s decision to charge only tuition fee. Meanwhile, there has been a spurt in protests outside schools across the city.Nitin Goyal, president, Chandigarh Parents Association, said: “We welcome the relief in form of reversal of fee hike. However, the term tuition fee continues to be the bone of contention since most schools merged all other heads under it in the recent years. So they will try to wriggle their way out.”‘DISASTROUS DECISION’However, HS Mamik, president, Independent Schools’ Association, Chandigarh, said: “The order has put schools in a quandary as 90% of the fee has been received, and by June 10, entire fee will be collected under the previous model.” “It is a disastrous decision under the garb of the Disaster Management Act. We are totally confused. We will have to go to court to get our grievances addressed,” he said.In the fresh notification, the UT has reasoned that schools were asked to display their balance sheets on their website, which they failed to do. Also, the fee structure has not been uploaded. This was done despite the fact that schools have to comply with all directions of the administration under the land allotment policy. The UT has also reasoned that it was receiving a lot of complaints from parents about a hike in tuition fee and various funds being collected under its head.FEE REGULATORY BODY TO MEET ON JUNE 15As the seven-day deadline given to 51 schools to respond to show-cause notices issued to them lapsed on Wednesday, director school education Rubinderjit Singh Brar said district education officer Alka Mehta has been tasked with preparing a report of the replies.All private schools had been asked to upload their balance sheets on their respective websites. However, only a few complied with the orders. The remaining were put on notice. “The DEO will submit a report, which will be discussed in the meeting of the fee regulatory body on June 15,” said Brar.Also, as some schools that did upload the balance sheets showed surplus of funds, Brar said another committee under the accounts branch has been constituted to check for profiteering. He said the penalty on erring schools will be decided by the fee regulatory body in the upcoming meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/private-schools-in-chandigarh-barred-from-hiking-fee-this-year/story-fOeQ0izbo1K4nKDcdKZWLI.html

03-06-2020||Chandigarh||World Bicycle Day: Industry sees a gloomy future in absence of government support||The city’s bicycle industry, which sees a gloomy future in the absence of governmental support, observed World Bicycle Day here on Wednesday and urged the government to help the industry in grabbing a major international market share amid the anti-China sentiment across the world. The city, known as industrial hub, produces over one crore cycles every year, but is lagging behind in terms of technology, needed to manufacture high-end bicycles.Expressing concern over the closure of Atlas Cycles in Haryana, publicity secretary of the United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) RS Sarhali said, “The government needs to pay heed to the problems of the industry, as many other units are at the verge of closure. If not provided any relief soon, the bicycle industry will not be able to survive.” Senior vice-president, Wholesale Bicycle Dealers Association, Achhru Ram Gupta, said, “The Union government is making tall claims regarding ‘Made In India’ drive, but no support package has been announced at a time when the industry is burdened with power bills, salaries, bank loans, etc and even the GST refunds are pending with the government.” Members of the Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisations (FICO) observed the day by organising a cycle rally in association with the Cyclists’ Club, Janta Nagar. President, FICO, Gurmeet Singh Kular, said, “The industry is facing a gloomy future with no support from the state or the Union government.”UCPMA president DS Chawla, however, pointed out the opportunity for the bicycle industry in the international market if the government helps industry in upgrading technology.“India produces around 2 crore cycles and caters to up to 40% of the world’s demand. However, its production is around 10% in comparison to that of China, which leads in terms of technology. If the government supports the industry at this time, the industry will surely grab a major share in the international market,” said Chawla, while adding cycling habit should also be inculcated among the students in schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/world-bicycle-day-industry-sees-a-gloomy-future-in-absence-of-government-support/story-Gv4oonEqvTobtxtDIGgZRJ.html

03-06-2020||City||Students seek mass promotion, but Central University of Kashmir in doubt over assessment mode||The students of Central University of Kashmir (CUK) are in stress as the varsity authorities have been indecisive about their examinations amid the Covid-19 pandemic.The students have demanded that they should be given mass promotion in their previous semesters as per the UGC guidelines, so they could concentrate on their current semester.“The university is not taking any decision despite the UGC guidelines. Our two semesters are pending. We want them to mass promote us in our previous semester and give relaxation in the current semester because we have faced a lot of problems due to the continuous Covid-19 lockdown,” said Gazi Ahmad Khan, president of CUK Students’ Federation.The students claimed that they were ready to appear in exams for the current semester.“Many are in their final semester and need to go for research or further studies. Their exams should be held immediately with some leniency in the syllabus and their backlogs cleared,” he said.Owing to the pandemic, the UGC had recommended that universities should conduct exams for final semesters only in July, while the students in intermediate semesters should be graded based on an internal assessment or in states where the Covid-19 situation has normalised, exams should be conducted in July only.“Since August 5, 2019 (when restrictions were imposed in J&K after revocation of its special status) up to March and then amid this lockdown, the students couldn’t attend their classes. Even online classes couldn’t be attended by the most of the students due to the non-availability of high-speed internet,” said Nadiya Rashid, spokesperson of the students’ federation.“Students are suffering from depression and seeing psychiatrists. It is our request to higher authorities of the varsity to give us mass promotion along with clearing our backlog subjects. Do justice to us and don’t force us to come on the streets,” she said.Varsity’s controller of examination Prof Parveen Pandit said the students have already been promoted to their next semesters, though they were yet to decide the mode of assessment.“We are yet to decide whether we will go for internal assessment or any other mode, keeping the UGC recommendations in mind,” she said.Last week, the University of Kashmir had announced that there will be no end-term exams for the current and previous semesters, wherever due, during the lockdown period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/students-seek-mass-promotion-but-central-university-of-kashmir-in-doubt-over-assessment-mode/story-lHjy9ftvF8yrzBayeQcGeP.html

The gym owners are also miffed at what they feel is step-motherly treatment being meted out to the industry by the government. Their contention is that despite Unlock 1.0 seeing another client interaction based industry – ‘salons & hair dressers’ reopening, and with restaurants and malls slated to reopen on June 8, the government is ignoring and delaying reopening of gyms.Sanjeev Kumar, president of TGOA said, “The prolonged lockdown has meant financial distress for owners of 200 fitness centres and gyms across tricity. Another issue is that almost 3,000 employees have had to go without pay for the last two months. Despite writing to UT adviser and administrator and deputy commissioners of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula asking for reopening of gyms under standard operating procedure, there has been no positive response.”The TGOA has also written to the Prime Minister asking for his intervention to resolve the problems of the industry in tricity. These include the financial burden on gym owners as well as large scale unemployment being faced by trainers, sales staff, spotters, house-keeping staff etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mohali-gym-owners-demand-reopening-of-their-establishments/story-mTg7cGrlUOZomEeiFvYpiO.html

As per information, permission was given for felling of 6,000 trees but the contractor cut 300 extra trees. The probe was conducted on the directions of the Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh after the chief minister’s office received a complaint in this regard.A senior official of the forest department said that Rs 5.72 lakh has already been deducted from the contractor’s security deposits and a notice has been issued to him for recovery of the remaining fine amount, which comes to Rs 3.30 lakh.VIOLATIONS GALOREThe team, led by assistant inspector general (vigilance) Ashish Kapoor, found that the contractor maintained no register to record the number of trees felled. Besides, fresh saplings were not planted in place of the felled trees, which is mandatory under the management plan approved by the Government of India. The contractor also violated the felling and marking rules by opening up the closed canopy of the forest. There were no records of labourers entering and exiting the forest area and even the condition of not felling trees after sunset was violated. No effort was made to apportion the common land, said vigilance officer.When contacted, contractor Kapil Sharma said, “We had got six permits to cut the trees. I got to know about the fine but I have not received any official intimation. The labourers had cut the trees by mistake.”The forest department gives permission to fell trees after every five years as per silvicultural practices. Vigilance sources revealed that even as felling trees having a diameter of less than 2-ft is not allowed, several such trees were chopped off.There are also reports that though the contractor was asked to complete the task by March 15 and ensure that logs are moved to the store by March 31, tree felling continued till mid-April, even after the lockdown was imposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rs-9-lakh-fine-on-contractor-for-felling-300-extra-khair-trees-in-mohali-forest/story-ZPShAkBM4Aki1XQZ3tuxXN.html

03-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab Local bodies dept relaxes single-bid tender norms||The Punjab local bodies department has announced relaxation in single-bid tender norms, introduced in 2018 on the recommendations of the then local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu citing corruption.The municipal corporations (MCs) in the state will now not have to float the tender for a project for the third, if there are less than three valid technical bids for the same each time. The contract can now be awarded to the bidder in the second attempt. Earlier, the authorities were allowed to award the contract with less than three bids in the third attempt. The officials said this would not only save money on publication of tenders, but will also save time. The process to award the contract, which used to take around one-and-a-half months, would now be completed in 35 days. An MC official, requesting anonymity, said even after Sidhu imposed single-bid norms, not much change was witnessed at the ground level. In most cases, the MC received less than three bids even after floating the tender for the third time. The same contractor, who had submitted a bid in the first attempt, got the contract even after the contract was floated for the third time. It may be due to a pool, formed by the contractors, or due to the less number of contractors with expertise to take up a particular project. MC superintending engineer (SE) HS Bhullar said, “The MC has received the notification and the single-bid contracts can now be awarded in the second attempt. This will save both time and money.” Sidhu had suspended four SEs in Ludhiana, Amritsar and Jalandhar in 2017 stating that projects worth hundreds of crores were allotted to contractors on a single bid with no competition, during the SAD-BJP regime in the state. The single-bid tender row had remained in the headlines as Congress MLAs, including Bharat Bhushan Ashu (now cabinet minister) and Sanjay Talwar, also lashed out at Sidhu in 2018, claiming that the single-bid tender norms were delaying only development projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-local-bodies-dept-relaxes-single-bid-tender-norms/story-K5gCAtOdKs49eNQzXJTXqO.html
03-06-2020||Chandigarh||Spurious paddy seed scam: Farmers in Ludhiana worried about ‘poor quality’ nursery||As investigation agencies are making inroads into the spurious paddy seed scam case, the farmers, who had purchased seed from Brar Seed Store, the shop accused of selling spurious seed, and raised paddy nurseries (paneeri), have started making distress calls to agriculture department officials complaining about the stunted growth of seedlings and deficiency in yield.“We are receiving distress calls each day from the farmers complaining about the less growth of paddy seedlings. As a solution, we are telling them to buy new seed and create a new nursery, if they are sowing rice with conventional pudding method. Similarly, those opting for DSR have also been advised to buy new seed as this is the right time to sow crops through the DSR,” said chief agricultural officer Narinder Singh Benipal.”“The department has also asked farmers to submit bills so that action could be taken against the dealers selling spurious seed. Sadly, many farmers do not have the bills,” said Benipal.Director agriculture, Punjab, Dr Sutantar Kumar Airi, said the department was stressing that farmers should take proper bills while buying agro inputs, including seed, fertilisers and pesticides to ensure stringent action against the firms selling substandard or unauthorised seed of crops.A Jagraon-based farmer, Baljinder Singh Bhundri, who is one of the key members of the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Kisan Club, was arrested on Tuesday as he was allegedly involved in the scam.According to police, Bhundri was providing the seed of PR 128 and PR 129 varieties of paddy, developed last year by PAU to assess the results as trial.However, he used the resultant crop to mass produce more seed and sold it to the Brar Seeds Store in Ludhiana without authorisation, the police said.The raid by the department at the Brar Seed Store, located in front of PAU Gate No 1 on March 11, had taken the lid off the nexus.The main accused, Hawinder Singh Kaka Brar, was arrested on May 31. Kaka is the son of Hardyal Singh, a former seed expert of PAU. Initially, the FIR was registered against octogenarian Hardyal Singh, but, as Singh was not keeping well, so his son Kaka Brar was arrested as he actually handling the business.The action against Brar Seed Store owners was taken on the complaint of the district’s chief agricultural officer after a Moga-based farmer alleged that the store was selling PR 128 and PR 129 seeds for Rs 200-250 per kg whereas PAU was selling it for Rs 70/kg only.The department had collected 11 samples of different rice verities, but out of 11 samples, 10 failed germination test and turned out to be spurious.The state agriculture department has so far carried out raid on 1,900 seed dealers across the state and revoked the licences of 12 seed stores.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/spurious-paddy-seed-scam-farmers-in-ludhiana-worried-about-poor-quality-nursery/story-M0X11sCQs6G60Dn0xiOF4M.html

More than 600 people are being registered everyday through the telephone lines, following which our doctors reach back to them and provide appointments to patients who need in-person consultation. But, there is no decision on reopening of OPDs as of now,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER. The hospital, however, is mulling to convert a part of the mutli-level parking outside the OPD into a holding area where patients can be screened before entering the building.“There is a fear of spread of infection. Even if one positive person enters the crowded OPD, it can create havoc. Who will be responsible for that?” Dr Ram questioned.On reopening of OPD services at GMCH-32 and GMSH-16, UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta said, “It is going to take time as UT’s health staff is still engaged in various activities like screening train and air passengers and are also working in containment zones in addition to taking care of Covid positive patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/two-months-on-crowding-concern-keeps-opds-at-chandigarh-s-govt-hospitals-shut/story-EKIJkzu43tOEFSOf3hLZzO.html
03-06-2020||City||Centre asks J&K L-G to defer reopening of schools from mid-June||Union minister Dr Jitendra Singh on Wednesday asked the Jammu and Kashmir administration to defer its decision of reopening schools and charging vehicle registration tax.“Have spoken to Jammu and Kashmir UT administration and suggested that decisions regarding vehicle registration tax and reopening of schools may be deferred,” the Union minister of state Dr Jitendra Singh tweeted on Wednesday.There had been strong resentment among the people over the UT adminitration’s purported move to reopen schools from June 15, especially among the parents.Former J&K women commission chairperson Vasundra Pathak Masoodi in a letter to lieutenant governor had described the plan as “an abject contravention and violation of the guidelines issued by the home ministry under the National Disaster Act”.In her letter on June 1 to the L-G, Masoodi had taken strong exception to the education department’s circular issued in Srinagar wherein it was stated that the administration intended to re-open schools in mid-June.“I have been approached by many parents across the UT who shared their fear and unwillingness to let their wards join school until the threat of Covid-19 pandemic is over as they are apprehensive that the children may not be able to strictly adhere to the social distancing norms,” she had stated in her letter.Reportedly, in an official circular, directors of education department in Kashmir and Jammu divisions were directed to ensure pairs of reusable masks and gloves to every student and ensure availability of 1,000ml hand sanitisers and 1,200ml liquid soap at the entry point of each government school.National Conference Jammu president Devender Singh Rana had exhorted the administration to exercise caution while deciding to reopen schools amid unfortunate increase in Covid-19 cases, saying any wrong move could be detrimental to the students.NO DECISION TAKEN YET, SAYS LG ADVISERFollowing the centre’s intervention, L-G adviser K K Sharma, who is also in-charge of the school education department, said the UT administration has not taken any decision to reopen the schools on June 15 yet.He, however, said instructions have been issued to schools to ensure sanitisation of the premises in view of Covid-19 across J&K.KASHMIRI PARENTS EXPRESS RESENTMENTMeanwhile in Kashmir, many parents termed the school reopening decision idiotic and risky for their children.“What is the logic of opening schools when every day more than 100 people are testing positive for Covid-19. Even the shops and markets are still closed. How can we put the life of our children at risk,” asked Ateeqa Begum, 45, mother of three schoolgoers.Resentment was expressed on the social media as well.“...Expecting school children to undertake social distancing and follow safety protocols, when top officers and doctors are falling prey to the deadly virus, is nothing but idiocy,” said Faheem Aslam, a Srinagar resident.Calls to commissioner secretary education Asgar Samoon and school education director Younis Malik went unanswered.The number of Covid-19 cases in Jammu and Kashmir has crossed 2,700 and the fatality tally is at 33.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centre-asks-j-k-l-g-to-defer-reopening-of-schools-from-mid-june/story-HeYfpeqhOl88LUggZA3UtI.html

On Tuesday as well, the Congress MP, along with three party MLAs, wrote an open letter to the chief minister seeking immediate release of the pending sugarcane arrears.“This does not convey the right message. A letter addressed to the CM should reach him and not the media. By releasing the letters to the media before dispatching it to the chief minister makes the motive and purpose of such letters obvious that the public concern (raised in these letters) is the last thing in the mind of the person,” said Mohindra.The minister suggested to Bajwa that he should act as the spokesperson of the Punjab government and highlight the achievements of the state in fighting the Covid-19.“Punjab has the highest recovery rate of about 90% while the death rate is less than 2%. This was despite huge influx of non-resident Indians (NRIs) and infected pilgrims all of whom were properly treated and most have recovered,” said Mohindra, who is the number two in the cabinet in seniority after the chief minister.“Bajwa as a loyal Congressman has every right to raise issues of public interest, but there is a proper way of doing things,” said the minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/send-letters-meant-for-cm-to-capt-not-media-brahm-to-mp-bajwa/story-69UXNMJ5fN2n9lg66jbZkO.html

03-06-2020||Mumbai||Only senior citizens or parents can file appeal under Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act: HC||The Bombay high court (HC) has held that only senior citizens or parents can file appeal under provisions of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007.“Sub-section (1) of section 16 permits ‘any senior citizen or a parent, as the case may be’ aggrieved by an order of a senior citizen tribunal, to prefer an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal,” justice AS Gadkari said last week while dismissing a petition filed by a 59-year-old World resident and her two children challenging a January 31, 2017 order of the senior citizen appellate tribunal.The appellate tribunal had refused to entertain their appeal against August 12, 2016 order of the senior citizen tribunal evicting them from a shop, an office at Prabhadevi and a workshop at Worli, owned by the petitioner’s estranged husband, a senior citizen.“A plain reading of the said section would clearly disclose that ‘children’ under Section 2(a) or ‘relative’ under Section 2(g) of the said Act are precluded from preferring an Appeal against an order of a tribunal,” said the court. “It is only the ‘senior citizen’ or ‘a parent’, as the case may be, is permitted to prefer an Appeal to the Appellate Tribunal under Section 16 of the said Act,” it added.All the three properties were self-acquired properties of the senior citizen and he had exclusive right over the properties. However, in October 2002, when the husband left his family residence, a power of attorney was executed conferring all powers over the properties to his wife, the petitioner, who had executed documents conferring tenancy rights of the properties to her children.Justice Gadkari held that transfer of the properties by the petitioner to her children was a fraud and therefore, the tribunal had rightly passed an order holding the transfer agreements as unauthorised and directing the petitioners to handover their possession to the senior citizen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/only-senior-citizens-or-parents-can-file-appeal-under-maintenance-and-welfare-of-parents-and-senior-citizens-act-hc/story-9r11tjrXt776C7gxU60CBK.html

They added that the trains will run again in case there is any fresh request, news agency PTI reported.“There is no demand for Shramik Special trains from the Delhi government as of now. There are no migrant trains scheduled from railway stations in Delhi. However a train from Gurgaon to Odisha’s Balasore is scheduled today,” a railway official was quoted as saying by PTI. The last trains to operate from Delhi were on May 31. They were : Anand Vihar- Purnia, Anand Vihar- Bhagalpur and Hazrat Nizamuddin-Mahoba Express. Indian Railways began running Shramik Special trains from May 1 to ferry back home migrant labourers stranded in various parts of the country due to the nationwide lockdown in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. From the five railway stations in Delhi, 242 of these special trains were run in the last one month. Of these, 111 took migrants to Bihar and 101 terminated in Uttar Pradesh. Over all, around 5.7 million stranded migrants across India have returned to their states in 4,155 such special trains thus far. However, there has been a decline in the demand to run these trains by the states in recent weeks. On Sunday, the Railways operated only 69 Shramik trains while on Tuesday only 102 Shramik trains operated till 10 am, railway officials said. “The demand for trains has reduced and only a very few trains are running as mostly all stranded migrants have been sent.

03-06-2020||Mumbai||Not equipped to start online teaching as students have not paid fees: Unaided pvt schools||Unaided private schools in the state have said that they are not equipped to start the new academic year online, as students have not paid fees.Three associations--the Private Unaided School Managements Association (PUSMA), Independent English Schools Association(IESA) and Unaided Schools Forum--declared that nearly 60% unaided private schools in Maharashtra are in financial distress and cannot start online teaching. “In budget private schools, many parents have not paid fees after the state education department issued a circular allowing them to make partial payments. Thus, we are unable to pay our teachers and take care of our basic expenses. How can we provide online education in such a situation”, said Bharat Malik from PUSMA. The association said that nearly 78% of the total private schools in the state are budget schools, which charge up to Rs 15,000 per year.On May 18, the three associations wrote to the state education department with their grievances but said there has been no response so far. “The decision to come up with government resolutions was taken without consulting all stakeholders. While it is true that parents are facing financial constraints due to the Covid-19 pandemic, schools are also struggling to make ends meet. These are also grim times for a lot of teachers who are having difficulties in getting their salaries,” said Rajendra Singh, working president, IESA. When asked about several big school chains imposing a fee hike even as the government has asked them not to, SC Kedia, secretary of the unaided schools forum said that the hikes were approved before the pandemic. “Due process has been followed while imposing hikes. Schools are offering some concessions to parents facing difficulties but as a whole, they cannot reduce fees because now expenses will increase with sanitisation costs and expenditure towards IT infrastructure for online teaching,” he added. As per a government resolution (GR) released in May first week, schools cannot hike fees for the academic year 2020-21 and have to allow parents to pay in instalments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/not-equipped-to-start-online-teaching-as-students-have-not-paid-fees-unaided-pvt-schools/story-Gny7GZoOyO0oHzMsoNSL0J.html

The protestors said the Punjab government had taken an ‘anti-people and anti-poor decision’ which will make medical education impossible for the middle class and economically weaker sections.‘PLUTOCRATIC DECISION’Amritsar Medical Student Association president Dr Vaibhav Chawla said, “Around 1,000 students, interns, senior residents and faculty members of GMC, Amritsar, wore black badges to show solidarity against the plutocratic decision of the government. MBBS students also staged a peaceful protest on the college premises.” ‘FEE ALREADY 55% HIGHER THAN OTHER STATES’“The government had earlier hiked the MBBS fee by 160% in 2015 and now it has announced another 80% hike. The fee of MBBS courses in Punjab is already the highest in India. It is around 55% higher than other states. Non-meritorious students from rich families will now get admission,” he said. Meanwhile, APP workers held a protest march from Valmiki Chowk to the residence of the medical education minister. Barnala AAP MLA Meet Hayer, Suman AAP MLA Aman Arora and AAP state youth wing president Manjinder Singh participated in the march. Majha Zone AAP president Kuldeep Dhaliwal, said, “Around 200 AAP workers raised slogans against the minister after gheraoing of his house. Later, we came to know the minister was in Patiala so we handed over a memorandum to his office workers, demanding roll-back of the decision to hike fee.”“The MBBS fee in government-run colleges in the state has been increased 12 times in 10 years and the 80% hike will be a setback for aspiring doctors,” he said. INCREASE DOCTORS’ SALARIES: AAP “The government is filling its own pockets by hiking students’ fee at a time when they are working as frontline warriors while combating the Covid-19 outbreak. Instead of hiking the fee, the government should increase doctors’ salaries and inters’ stipends,” said Dhaliwal, adding that AAP will intensify its protest if the government does not roll back the decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mbbs-fee-hike-gmc-doctors-aap-workers-stage-protest-in-amritsar/story-hxLuaZUtdDwAEMF2qEE5kM.html
03-06-2020||Mumbai||From Nisarga to Amphan: How do tropical cyclones form||India has been hit by two cyclones, Nisarga and Amphan, in less than a month as the country is already in the grip of the coronavirus pandemic and there is a severe strain on the health care system and personnel.Nisarga, like Amphan which battered West Bengal and Odisha last month, is expected to submerge low-lying areas, uproot trees, destroy uncemented houses and critical infrastructure, and worse, kill people and animals. The aftermath of the storm will be challenging too. Here is how tropical cyclones form:* Tropical cyclones form in the tropics when the sea is warm (sea surface temperature ≥ 26.50 degree C)* When the water vapour from the warm ocean condenses to form clouds, it releases its heat to the air* The warmed air rises and is pulled into the column of clouds. Evaporation and condensation continue, building the cloud columns higher and larger* A pattern develops, with the wind circulating around a centre (like water going down a drain). As the moving column of air encounters more clouds, it becomes a cluster of thunderstorm clouds, called a tropical disturbance* As the thunderstorm grows higher and larger, the air at the top of the cloud column is cooling and becoming unstable* The heat energy is released from the cooling water vapour, the air at the top of the clouds becomes warmer, making the air pressure higher and causing winds to move outward away from the high-pressure area* This movement and warming cause pressures at the surface to drop. Then air at the surface moves toward the lower pressure area, rises, and creates more thunderstorms* Winds in the storm cloud column spin faster and faster, whipping around in a circular motion. When the winds reach between 25 and 38mph, the storm is called a tropical depression* When the wind speeds reach 70 kmph, the tropical depression becomes a tropical storm. This is also when the storm gets a name* The winds blow faster and begin twisting and turning around the eye, or calm centre, of the stormFavourable environmental conditions for their formation:* Warm ocean waters (of at least 26.5°C) throughout a sufficient depth (at least 50m). Warm waters are necessary to fuel the heat engine of the tropical cyclone* An atmosphere which cools fast enough with height such that it is potentially unstable to moist convection* Relatively moist layers near the mid-troposphere (5km). Dry mid levels are not conducive for allowing the continuing development of widespread thunderstorm activity* A minimum distance of at least 500km from the equator* Coriolis force so that the low pressure of the disturbance can be maintained. The Coriolis effect is the pattern of deflection taken by objects not firmly connected to the ground as they travel long distances around the Earth.* Low values of vertical wind shear--the magnitude of wind change with height.(Source: IMD/ NOAA/National Geographic)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/from-nisarga-to-amphan-how-do-tropical-cyclones-form/story-6FIRALmbTQbSurQmpOPW3I.html
03-06-2020||Chandigarh||Hectic lobbying underway for Himachal BJP chief’s post, panel of five names sent to Nadda||Shimla: A week after Rajeev Bindal stepped down as the Himachal Pradesh BJP chief when his name surfaced in the health department medical equipment scam, hectic lobbying is underway for the coveted post.A vigilance and anti-corruption department probe into the irregularities in the purchase of medical equipment was ordered after an audio clip of former health director Dr Ajay Gupta’s conversation with a dealer surfaced on social media in which he was heard seeking a bribe of Rs 5 lakh. Though Bindal, 65, denied any link to the case, he quit on moral grounds.Former chief minister Shanta Kumar was critical of the scam in the purchase of equipment amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the matter reached the offices of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and party national president Jagat Parkash Nadda. Bindal was Nadda’s choice for the state president in January, but he wasted no time in accepting his resignation as the opposition Congress scaled up its attack on chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, who also holds the health portfolio.Among the aspirants, backed by party stalwarts, lobbying for the post is Randhir Sharma, a two-time legislator who also remained the BJP state general secretary. Sharma, who is the chief spokesman of the party, is backed by former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal.Shanta Kumar is once again backing Rajeev Bhardwaj, who is chairman of the Kangra Co-operative Bank. He remained the state secretary of the party and also served as its vice-president. Bhardwaj was also the district president of the BJP’s Kangra unit.Party general secretary Trilok Jamwal is another frontrunner. His name had also cropped up when Bindal replaced the party’s longest serving president Satpal Singh Satti five months ago. Trilok is from Bilaspur district and considered close to Nadda. The party’s powerful organisational secretary, Pawan Rana, backs Trilok.First-time legislator from Sundernagar and party general secretary Rakesh Jamwal is the blue-eyed boy of the chief minister and a keen contender for the post. He was earlier president of the party’s Mandi district unit.Ram Singh, who is from the Scheduled Caste community, may have unsuccessfully contested the assembly elections from Kullu in 2012 but he enjoys the backing of Sangh leaders and is also vying for the post. Ram Singh had been president of the party’s Kullu district unit.The state unit has drawn up a panel of the names of all five aspirants and forwarded them to Nadda. There is every likelihood that the party high command may have its own choice for state BJP president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hectic-lobbying-underway-for-himachal-bjp-chief-s-post-panel-of-five-names-sent-to-nadda/story-2j8b2eFEpYvRUY6YLVaMmO.html

They are in judicial custody after they were produced in a local court.Explaining their modus operandi, Jain said Sridhar, the cab driver, created a fake vehicle insurance policy document when his car’s insurance got expired.“He first tried it on himself and easily got away when stopped by the traffic police. The documents looked like original and the police let him go,” he said.On passing the police test, Sridhar and Santosh identified a way to make money creating such fake documents and vehicle registration cards.“It will cost some Rs 20-25 thousand to buy insurance per year, but the two were selling these fake insurance documents for around Rs 2,000, creating them at home,” said Jain.The fake papers were so well made that the two could replicate the documents of all major insurance companies in the market which easily passed the traffic police test.Using 60-70 seals, and following the latest format of such papers, the two continued with their “trade” for six months.Most enforcement agencies would not spend a much time on the genuineness of the documents, he said.“It was difficult to apprehend the duo. Based on some leads, we raided their home and seized a lot of seals, documents, a printer and a computer,” said Jain.Likewise, Sridhar and Santosh were also creating fake vehicle registration cards by defacing the flip-side of a card and reprinting with new information, mostly for second vehicles.“A CCB team led by police Inspector Hazresh detected fake insurance and registration card scam. Two accused have been arrested and fake seals, registration cards, insurance policies have been seized. Further investigation is on,” tweeted Joint Commissioner of Police Sandeep Patil.Some of the leading insurance companies the two used for creating the fake papers included Tata AIG Insurance, Shriram, Reliance and United India Insurance among others.(The story has been published from a wire feed without any modifications to the text, only the headline has been changed.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/bengaluru-duo-arrested-for-selling-fake-insurance-registration-papers/story-J72MRROjIKdY8fVlE9nFsJ.html

03-06-2020||Chandigarh||Stranded migrant workers stage protest outside DC’s office in Amritsar||At least two hundred migrant workers and their families staged a protest outside the deputy commissioner’s (DC’s) office here on Wednesday, and demanded that their return to their native places be facilitated. They said they had been stranded in the district for three months. “We do not have any accommodation, food or employment. It is difficult for us to continue like this any longer, especially for those with young children,” a protesting migrant labourer said.MIGRANTS CAMPING NEAR RAILWAY STATION TOLD TO MOVE The protestors had been waiting to return home for the last four-five days near the Amritsar railway station. “Now, we have been asked to vacate the area near the railway station as shops have started opening,” a protestor said. The protest started around 9am. Labourers say they will continue the sit-in until they get some assurance from the administration. “Around 50 of us had been working in Beas town before the coronavirus-induced lockdown. Now, we have been sacked. We cannot live here anymore and want to return home,” said migrant labourer Vidhya Devi Chauhan.“For the last four days we had been living outside the railway station. Some of us had been sleeping without food. There was no toilet facility. We have applied to return home, but have not received any response. Yesterday, some policemen took copies of our Aadhaar cards, but we don’t know when we will be allowed to return to our native places,” said Chauhan.Mithun Kumar of Bihar said, “We have been out of work for the last three months. At least 1,000 labourers are still stranded here. The Bihar government should arrange for our return.”Rajesh Kumar of Chattisgarh said, “We have been living on the roads. Arranging food and a bath has become difficult for us.”“For last four days, we have been told that no trains are available. The lockdown is killing us, not coronavirus,” said a woman cradling her child. Shramik trains will be arranged: ADC Additional deputy commissioner (ADC-general) Himanshu Aggarwal said the migrant workers had come to the railway station on Tuesday night. “Those who had come to the railway station before yesterday were sent to shelter homes,” he said.“Most of the workers who have gathered outside the DC’s office had been working in brick kilns. They are from Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh,” Aggarwal said.Aggarwal said, “We have asked the owners of the brick kilns to provide the exact number of migrant workers who want to return home.”“Earlier, half-empty Shramik trains had run from Amritsar to various states. If we had the details of these migrants labourers, we would have sent them home. Now, these migrants will be shifted to shelters. After ascertaining the total migrants who want to go to their native places we will arrange Sharmik trains for them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/stranded-migrant-workers-stage-protest-outside-dc-s-office-in-amritsar/story-drRUxeNgCG7Nqz5PxlUOYO.html

03-06-2020||Delhi||Traffic crawls at Delhi-Ghaziabad border as cops screen vehicles for passes||Thousands of commuters were caught in a long traffic jam at the Delhi-Ghaziabad border due to strict checking. The jam, say commuters, began at around 9am and led to long queues which then spread to the internal roads in Ghaziabad.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that borders of Delhi will be sealed for one week. Ghaziabad has put in similar restrictions since April 22, citing a rising number of cases in the district when city residents travel to Delhi.“I came to drop off my wife who goes to Delhi by car pool. But we got stuck as there is heavy jam from the UP-Gate up to Dabur-crossing on the Link Road and also up to Gaur Green Avenue in Indirapuram on the Delhi-Meerut expressway. The cops are checking every vehicle at the border, which has led to this. Every vehicle is getting checked for passes,” said Jeevan Singh, a resident of Vasundhara.The Ghaziabad police officials said the checking of vehicles by the Delhi police led to traffic jams on the UP side.“The Delhi police are checking vehicles at the border so there is very slow movement of vehicles and have led to long queues in Ghaziabad jurisdiction. On our side, we are checking vehicles which are entering Ghaziabad from Delhi,” said Anshu Jain, circle officer (Indirapuram).The officials have even restricted passage of vehicles before 9am and have advised commuters to return from Delhi after 6pm. Fresh instructions were issued on May 25 with certain categories of commuters exempted upon production of their identification cards and valid authorisation letters from their offices.Some of the commuters who left Ghaziabad for Delhi early morning said that there were no checks around 7.30am.“I crossed the UP-Gate border around 7.30m but there were no checks either by the Ghaziabad police or the Delhi police. There was less traffic and I reached my office within 45 minutes. The National Highways Authority of India is also performing repair work on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway and this has also added to traffic jams near the UP-Gate,” said Kuldeep Saxena, Indirapuram resident.The officials of the NHAI said that the traffic jams were not due to DME works but due to barricading put up at the border area of NH-9.“Generally the barricading or blocking the highway is not allowed but cops do it to maintain law and order. Earlier we had written to the Delhi authorities about this in order to remove barricading near Akshardham. Otherwise, the purpose of highway and expressway gets defeated,” said Mudit Garg, deputy general manager of NHAI.According to NHAI officials, the traffic on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, which is under construction from the UP-Gate to Dasna in Ghaziabad, the passenger car units (PCUs) have reduced to one-fourth during the lockdown period.“According to our estimates, there is about 80,000 PCU traffic at the UP-Gate which is just one fourth during the present times. The ratio is the same at our toll at Chijarsi (at Pilkhuwa town in Hapur). Our road has full capacity to cater to traffic and our works have not hampered movement of vehicles. It is because of barricading and checks taken up by police,” Garg added.The phase 1 of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, about 10km, stretches from Akshardham to the UP-Gate and is operational. The stretch caters to about 1.2 lakh PCUs per day.The under construction phase 2 of the project is in Ghaziabad and spreads to about 19.8km from the UP-Gate to Dasna. This stretch caters to about 80,000 PCUs per day.The officials said that different works under phase 2 are taking place at Hindon canal, near Khoda, near CISF camp and Vijay Nagar areas in the Ghaziabad district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/traffic-crawls-at-delhi-ghaziabad-border-as-cops-screen-vehicles-for-passes/story-d1OYj7IlD55z51BDnht5GJ.html

It has also asked citizens to keep their mobile phones and power banks charged to ensure connectivity, and to keep candles handy. The city has been receiving light rains in several places since early morning.However, power distribution firms have said there will be no scheduled shutdowns. The Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company (Mahatransco) has created a contingency plan for all stakeholders for Wednesday and Thursday to prevent power outage in the state.There will be no planned shutdown of power supply in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and north Maharashtra on the two days, the plan, accessed by HT, stated. All the sub-station, operation and maintenance personnel and engineers have been asked to remain alert at power stations, to analyse the cause of tripping and take quick action, in case of any glitches. Mahatransco has also asked an adequate number of experienced staffers to be deployed at the control centres for ‘crisis management’. “A system restoration procedure will also be readily available for the teams to take quick action,” an official from the transmission arm said.The BrihanMumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking, which supplies power to Mumbai’s island city, said it will keep its engineers on standby so that immediate action can be taken in case of a power failure, especially at Covid-19 hospitals or care centres. Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML), a major power supplier in the city and its suburbs, said all necessary precautions have been taken. “Our specialised quick response teams are on standby. Consumers can call our helpline 19122, and our teams will attend to their concerns at the earliest,” an AEML spokesperson said.According to BMC’S disaster management department, officers from each of the 24 wards are on standby, followed by 150-plus members from MFB who will activate the flood response plan, in case of an emergency. Further, 94 lifeguards are on standby at several beaches in the city including Girgaon Chowpatty, Juhu, Versova, Aksa and Gorai, BMC officials said. Citizens have been barred from going to beaches in the city under a Section 144 order by the Mumbai Police.Three NDRF teams of 45 members each were already stationed in Mumbai until Tuesday. An additional five teams of 45 members each were airlifted from Andhra Pradesh late on Tuesday night.The NDRF team is on standby with equipment such as rescue boats, tree and pole cutters, life jackets, ropes, breathing masks, floaters, etc.An official from BMC’s Disaster Management Cell said, “The main worry is slums in places like Versova and Colaba, considering they are almost on the seashore. Many of those residing in these slums were identified and evacuated on Tuesday night.”The official added, “We are expecting a lot of trees to fall, and the ward level and MFB officials are already on standby for the same. Thankfully, as per the predictions, the landfall is in afternoon when there is a low tide, however, it will be worrying if during the landfall there is heavy rainfall.”In the next three days, there will be three high tides of over four metres at least thrice. The first high tide of 4.26 metres was on Wednesday at 10.06 am. This will be followed by a 4.56 metre high tide at 10.57 am on Thursday, and a third one is expected at 11.45 am on Friday of 4.75 metres.Meanwhile, in an advisory issued on Tuesday, the BMC said, “If for some unavoidable reason, you need to drive your car, please ensure that you carry a hammer or objects that can help you break the glass in case your car doors get jammed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/500-emergency-response-team-members-on-standby-as-mumbai-braces-for-cyclone-nisarga/story-ACbQsC3U2M8Cc7J9OJVwxH.html

03-06-2020||Kolkata||Bengal Guv takes ‘strong exception’ to TMC minister for calling him as ‘BJP man’||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankar on Tuesday took a ‘strong exception’ to widely reported statement of state’s Education Minister Partha Chatterjee in which he has called the Governor ‘BJP man’ for the appointment of Prof Goutam Chandra the Pro-Vice chancellor of Burdwan University.“This is very unfortunate. We sent him our choice but he appointed a person, not on the list. He always wanted to appoint the people loyal to the BJP. This is not done. We will not accept him in that position ... The Governor should have remembered that the government pays salaries in all the universities,” Chatterjee has said, according to a statement issued by the Raj Bhavan.Responding to these allegations, West Bengal Governor Dhankar said that on a point of fact also he has tripped and the names were shared with him and the consultation as per Act effected.“Such an allegatory stance, apart from being highly regretful, is unbecoming for the position he holds as Minister. It is also an outrage of the Oath of Office he has taken as a Minister. His earlier attempts to politicise the Office of the Governor/Chancellor and now this outrageous comment cannot be countenanced, as the approach is indicative of a strategy to embroil the Office of Governor in the public domain in controversy,” Governor Dhankar was quoted as saying in the statement.“His stance that the Governor should remember that ‘government pays salaries in all the universities’ is not only lamentable but betrays ignorance about the working of the Constitution and democracy. Does he intend to indicate that by paying salaries such vital educational institutions are required to be at his beck and call, be in subordination and compliance mode? Such a situation will be a death-knell of education in the State, and is unacceptable,” he added.According to the Governor, the appointment of the Pro Vice-Chancellor of Burdwan University was effected after due consultation with the Minister on more than one occasion in accordance with the Statutory provisions of the Burdwan University Act. “The same is in accordance with the legal regime and competence of the Chancellor enjoys under the provisions of the Act. Suggestion by the Government received full consideration but the final decision in the mater as per the Statute rests with the Chancellor and that was taken fully in accordance with the provisions,” Governor said.The West Bengal Governor said that the rationale of Minister Chatterjee’s logic is otherwise also fragile. “By his logic, institutions like that of the Governor under Article 158, the Public Service Commission under Article 322, the High Court and the like, whose salaries are paid by the State government, should be in subordination or compliance mode. It is hoped such unthoughtful and constitutionally repugnant statement is immediately withdrawn and the intervention of the Chief Minister on the point is called for,” he said.The Governor further said that the appointment of Prof Goutam Chandra by the Chancellor as Pro-Vice chancellor, Burdwan University, was in accordance with the provision contained in Section 9A (1) (b) of the West Bengal University Laws (Amendment) Act, 2011. “The Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Administration and Academic) shall be appointed by the Chancellor in consultation with the Minister. The term of his office shall be for four years and he shall be eligible for re-appointment for a period not exceeding four years but shall not hold office beyond the age of sixty-five years,” provisions read as quoted by West Bengal Governor Dhankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-guv-takes-strong-exception-to-tmc-minister-for-calling-him-as-bjp-man/story-9tMwZ3qjz2Jry9lSVz8LqN.html
03-06-2020||Jaipur||Centre’s hike in MSP ‘insignificant’, raise procurement limit to 50%: Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said on Tuesday the raise in the minimum support price (MSP) announced by the central government was “totally insignificant” and demanded an increase in the limit of procurement for crops to at least 50%.Ashok Gehlot said in a series of tweets that the Centre’s promise to double the income of farmers by 2022 was just another “jumla”.His comments came after the Centre on Monday raised paddy MSP marginally by Rs 53 per quintal to Rs 1,868 per quintal for the 2020-21 crop year and hiked the rates for oilseeds, pulses and cereals substantially.Cotton’s MSP was increased by Rs 260 per quintal to Rs 5,515 for medium staple variety and by Rs 275 per quintal to Rs 5,825 for long-staple variety of cotton for the current crop year (July-June).“Hike in MSP announced by government is totally insignificant looking at the hardships faced by our farmers, who have been hit hard by not only corona but sliding economy, locust attacks, cyclone etc. Farmers have been desperately waiting to get concrete relief but their hopes have been dashed,” Ashok Gehlot tweeted. Hike in MSP announced by Govt is totally insignificant looking at hardships faced by our farmers, who hv been hit hard by not only corona but sliding economy, locust attacks, cyclone,etc. Farmers have been desperately waiting to get concrete relief but their hopes hv been dashed.“If the government of India really wants to help the Annadata, it should increase the limit of MSP procurement from 25% of the crop produce to at least 50% under the Price Stabilization Scheme and fix MSP as recommended in the Swaminathan report,” he said. If the government of India really wants to help the Annadata, it should increase the limit of MSP procurement from 25% of the crop produce to at least 50% under the Price Stabilization Scheme and fix MSP as recommended in the Swaminathan report.“The so called raised MSP is a paltry amount, which doesn’t even cover farmers’ input costs. The increase is just 2.07 % for moong and 7.5 % for bajra, which makes the tall promise of GoI of doubling the farmers’ income by 2022, look like yet another jumla (sic),” he added.Recently, the state government had announced relief to farmers, industries and domestic consumers in the payment of electricity bills on April 2. It has extended the payment of electricity bills to June 30, which earlier was till May 31 amid the coronavirus pandemic. The government had also extended the amnesty scheme period till June 30 for such agricultural and domestic connections, which were disconnected before March 31, 2019, over pending arrears.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/centre-s-hike-in-msp-insignificant-raise-procurement-limit-to-50-rajasthan-cm-ashok-gehlot/story-NfT2liwX2yxrOjtLXem3fL.html

Srikanta Biswal, his 55-year-old mother and three sisters in the age group of 30 to 38 years from Lahandabud under BTM police station area of Jharsuguda district were admitted to the district headquarters hospital on Tuesday morning in critical condition.One of the deceased youth’s sisters, who first tried hanging herself before drinking phenyl, was shifted to Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Hospital after her condition worsened.Suchismita Mohanty, the inspector of BTM police station, said the five people were traumatised after 22-year-old Dipak Biswal succumbed to his injuries in a nursing home on Monday, two years after he met with a road accident.“The family’s head Golak Bihari Biswal, an employee of PSU Mahanadi Coalfields Limited, had also died after retiring from service in 2016. After the accident involving Dipak in 2018, the family had spent over Rs 30 lakh on his treatment but there was very little recovery. On Monday, he was admitted to a nursing home after his condition deteriorated but he passed away,” Mohanty said.One of the members of Biswal family, who too attempted suicide, told the police that they were very close and could not bear the thought of losing their brother.“When my brother died last evening we decided to die along with him and consumed phenyl and herbicides,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/5-family-members-in-odisha-attempt-suicide-after-son-s-death/story-t7dgnfHNvkrqGCEmiUjsmM.html
03-06-2020||Delhi||Uncertainty dogs commuters but Delhi’s borders stay open for now||Traffic moved smoothly at some of the 29 border points in Delhi while intermittent checking was conducted at some others on Tuesday, a day after the Delhi government put stringent curbs on interstate travel for a week to protect the city’s health care resources as Covid-19 cases crossed the 20,000-mark.On Tuesday, Delhi reported 1,298 Covid cases with the total tally reaching 22,132. Eleven more people died over the last 24 hours, taking the toll to 556, according to the Delhi government’s daily bulletin. The average number of daily new cases in the last week has been 1,095 and the Delhi government has been taking several measures to augment bed strength across hospitals and medical institutions. Senior Delhi Police officers said their personnel were briefed not to “unnecessarily harass anyone” and “allow Delhi residents to enter the Capital after seeing their residential proof”. Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageMany regular commuters Hindustan Times spoke to said that their travel to Delhi from Ghaziabad and Noida was smoother than what they had experienced in the past few weeks despite curbs imposed by the district administrations of the two Uttar Pradesh cities.A Delhi government spokesperson said, “The Delhi government had sent the order to seal all borders to the Delhi police. It is now the job of the police to enforce it. The Delhi police is not under us.” At the Gurugram border, there was no restriction on the Delhi side as commuters, including officer-goers, drove across without any checking by the Delhi Police staff. At the Ghaziabad (UP)-Ghazipur (Delhi) border, the police conducted random checks occasionally during the day time. But in the evening peak hour, no car was being stopped from entering or leaving Delhi. Many commuters said they were confused about whether the restrictions on the border had been relaxed.The Gurugram police, however, closed the barricades to check for movement passes and turned away a few commuters who could not establish a reason to visit the city. The police also asked people to paste the movement pass issued by the district administration on the windscreen of their cars so that their personnel deployed at the border can check it without disrupting the traffic flow.The Haryana government had decided on Sunday evening to ease restrictions on the state’s borders with Delhi in Gurugram that had been in place since May 1. Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday said talks will be held with the Delhi government to build a consensus on the inter-state movement issue. He, however, said some restrictions should stay in place. “Our borders were already closed but when the Delhi government said these should not be opened, we felt what they are saying holds weight. Strictness should be there for now along the Delhi-Haryana border,” Khattar said.Mandeep Singh, a senior executive of a private company in Gurugram, said he had left his home in Hauz Khaz for his office at 7am to avoid any screening from the police at the border. “I left way ahead of my office reporting time because I did not have any pass to show to the police had they stopped me. But, my colleagues who came from Delhi at the usual office time, later told me that there was no checking of any kind. I had a sleepless night for no reason. The government should have made its intention clear,” he said. At the Badarpur border, however, the police checked the identity cards and passes of all commuters entering the national capital by cars or motorcycles, but no questions were asked of those leaving the city.Many motorists had a tough time trying to convince the police that they belonged to Delhi and should be allowed to pass through.“So many people are showing old passes. We don’t know how to deal with them. So, we are going by our judgement in each case,” said an assistant sub-inspector deployed there.“I had gone to a client’s home in Indirapuram in the morning. Nobody stopped me or asked for any pass. Now that I want to return home, the policemen at Delhi border refused to let me in as I do not have a movement pass. I told them Delhi CM has banned other states’ residents and showed them my Delhi residence proof. But they are not letting me in,” said east Delhi’s Mandawali resident Anil Pandit, after a brief argument with police at the Ghazipur border.Deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said, “Personnel deployed at borders have been briefed to assist people who are facing urgent situations.”At the Dundahera and Mandi Border-(Chattarpur farms) in south Delhi, commuters were seen crossing the border without any checks, even as police barricades and policemen were present. Similarly, no restrictions were seen at the Maharajpur, Mayur Vihar, and Bhopura borders in east and northeast Delhi, as motorists were crossing the barricades freely.“We are implementing all provisions mentioned in the new notification. Whatever issues have come to our notice will soon be resolved. Those who need to visit Delhi should get movement passes,” said Delhi Police spokesperson, Mandeep Singh Randhawa.While traffic flow was mostly smooth, the issuance of travel passes by district magistrates in Delhi appeared to be a source of confusion. While senior officials in the government said those working in private firms will also be issued passes by the district magistrates (DMs), administrations remained divided over whether to give passes only to those engaged in emergency and essential services, or grant permission to others in non-essential sectors as well. “At a time when all offices and other economic activities have opened up nationally, it is difficult to restrict movement. There are over 4,000 e-pass applications pending, accumulated over two days,” said one DM, on condition of anonymity.

Authorities have also shifted around 1,400 residents of Narpad, Ambewadi and Dahanu areas to nearby schools, resorts and other places.However, some locals of Satpati village have been refusing to shift into temporary shelters. “While we have successfully evacuated 50 families of Toofanpada in Satpati village to safer locations, such as nearby schools and resorts, some villagers have been refusing to relocate stating that they prefer to stay at their relatives’ homes. We are trying to convince them. Dr Shinde and superintendent of police Duttatray Shinde are overlooking the evacuation process,” said Jitendra Thakur, assistant inspector, Satpati police station. Meanwhile, the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) said the nuclear power installations of four units of Tarapur Atomic Power Station (TAPS), as well as the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) in Tarapur do not face any threat as installations can withstand cyclonic winds with a speed of more than 180 kilometre/hour, said Dr Shinde. The Adani Thermal Power Station (ATPS) in Dahanu, which generates 500 megawatts of thermal power will continue to operate, authorities have informed. “But we have directed the employees residing outside Dahanu to not to report to work. The unit from Dahanu supplies power to suburban Mumbai and there will be no power generation issues,” said Shinde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cyclone-nisarga-22-villages-in-palghar-on-red-alert/story-bYimA0b8r929Fgelxlc0uK.html

03-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police impose Section 144 in view of Cyclone Nisarga||In view of the threat posed by impending Cyclone Nisarga, the Mumbai Police on Wednesday imposed Section 144 in the entire city from midnight to Thursday afternoon and banned people from coming to places like beaches, parks and promenades along the coastline. Section 144 (CrPC) has been promulgated in the city from 00:00 hours, June 3rd till 12:00 hours, June 4th.Refrain from venturing out to coast-beaches, promenade, parks and other similar places along the coastline.#TakingOnNisargaDue to the cyclone, there are 8 arrivals and 11 departures of flights for Wednesday, instead of 25 departures and 25 arrivals, said a statement.A deep depression over east-central Arabian Sea, which intensified into cyclone Nisarga on Tuesday noon is expected to make landfall as a severe cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 100 to 110 kmph gusting to 120 kmph near Alibag in Raigad district on June 3, the India Metereological Department (IMD) said on Tuesday. It started as a warning on Sunday for mid-week heavy rains in Mumbai and by Monday, rapidly developed into a red alert for several coastal districts as the deep depression progressed over the Arabian Sea. As of Tuesday noon, cyclone Nisarga was 280 km west-southwest of Goa, 490 km south-southwest of Mumbai and 710 km south-southwest of Surat . The IMD said that the cyclone was likely to cross north Maharashtra and adjoining south Gujarat coast between Daman and Harihareshwar in Raigad on Wednesday afternoon.The western coastline from Konkan’s Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri to Saurashtra’s Bhavnagar and other districts of Gujarat including Surat and Baruch have received wind warnings ranging from 55-65 kmph (gusting to 75kmph) and increasing to gusting speeds of 115-120kmph in four Maharashtra districts of Palghar, Mumbai, Thane and Raigad. Though a wide expanse of districts stands to be affected across coastal Maharashtra and Gujarat, higher wind speeds in the four districts mentioned above offer an indication of where the cyclone is likely to have maximum impact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-issue-section-144-in-view-of-cyclone-nisarga/story-VLDN0920h7hKyx7UsqFCEJ.html
03-06-2020||Mumbai||Residents say BMC did not issue any cyclone warning||From shelter homes in municipal schools and transport arrangements to evacuate people to team of labourers to remove debris, arrangements for food packets and regular announcements in coastal areas, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has started preparations, in the wake of the Cyclone Nisarga warning. However, residents of several coastal areas said they are clueless about the civic body’s advisory.Areas such as Worli, Dadar, Marine Drive, Cuffe Parade, Mahim, Bandra, Versova and Malad have several sea-facing buildings and slum pockets along the coastline. Some residents’ associations complained the local ward offices are not interacting with people living on the coastline. Some have, however, taken precautionary measures. Ashok Patel from Cuffe Parade Residents’ Association said no special advisory has been issued to them, even though 30 towers in the area are sea-facing. “There has been no communication from the ward office. Several residents are clueless and are only relying on forwarded messages,” he said. Mehjabeen Barwani of Juhu Citizens’ Welfare Group, said, “As yet, there has been no official communication. Our local representatives are updating us with all precautionary measures. The BMC should be in contact with the residents’ associations in the city, as it is easier to communicate during such times.”Mahendra Hemdev, coordinator of Marine Drive Residents’ Association, said, “We are shifting all loose material from the balconies. The local corporator is in constant touch with us and updating us. All residents are in touch with each other.” The 4-km stretch of Marine Drive has at least 80 sea-facing buildings.A senior civic official said a team of ward officials is being sent to coastal areas, where they are making announcements on safety measures. The BMC’s official Twitter handle has also put out ‘dos and don’ts’.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of G North (Dadar-Mahim), said, “We have identified three municipal schools which were to be turned into quarantine centres for Covid-19, but will now be used to shift people from high-risk zones.” Another ward official from Juhu said they are making announcements and removing temporary structures on the beach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/residents-say-bmc-did-not-issue-any-cyclone-warning/story-HgtLa0fbNZLmV2a1D0zUlO.html

03-06-2020||City||Cyclone Nisarga: No planned power shutdown in Mumbai Metropolitan Region||With Cyclone Nisarga likely to have an impact over power supply and distribution across the west coast, the Maharashtra transmission authority Mahatransco has created a contingency plan for all stakeholders for June 3 and 4. On Tuesday night, the Union ministry of power also released a press statement, in which it said that it will closely monitor the power status in the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra on an hourly basis.There will be no planned shut-down of power supply in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and North Maharashtra on the two days, the plan, accessed by HT, stated. All the substation, operation and maintenance personnel and engineers have been asked to remain alert at power stations, to analyse the cause of tripping and take quick action, in case of any glitches pertaining to power supply.It has also asked an adequate number of experienced staffers to be deployed at the control centres for “crisis management.” “A system restoration procedure will also be readily available for the teams to take quick action,” an official from the transmission arm said.Officials said that power failure can occur owing to the collapse of overhead wires, tree-collapse or inundation resulting in damage to underground wires. “In some cases, supply might have to be temporarily shut if there is massive flooding in some areas to avoid any mishaps,” an official from the distribution arm of the state power said.The Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) Undertaking, which supplies power to the Island city, will also deploy its engineers on stand-by so that immediate action is taken in case of a power failure, especially at Covid-19 hospitals or care centres. Meanwhile, Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML), which supplies to a major part of the city, said that all necessary precautions have been taken from their end. “To ensure the continuity of power supply and mitigate any disruptions owing to the cyclone, AEML has taken all necessary precautions, and our specialised quick response teams are on standby. During these testing times, we request our consumers to stay indoors. In case of any issues with the power supply, consumers can call our helpline 19122, and our teams will attend to their concerns at the earliest,” an AEML spokesperson said.Precautions have been taken at infrastructure sites, too. An official said that measures such as locking gantry cranes at casting yards, removal of loose materials from concourse/platform levels at Metro sites, lowering piling rigs and keeping them in a horizontal position, and protecting electrical boards, were underway on Tuesday to avoid any mishap. “The electrical boards will also be switched-off during cyclone hours,” an official said.The Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC), which is building a 33.5 km underground metro in Mumbai, has also adopted several measures at its sites. A spokesperson said that piling rigs and boom of cranes have been lowered, gantry cranes locked, de-watering pumps readied and flash-lights will be on for the next 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cyclone-nisarga-no-planned-power-shutdown-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region/story-5llkgjnd4S6NmH38Hr9tvL.html
03-06-2020||City||With Covid-19 lockdown, poetry flowers virtually in Valley||Srinagar: “Again a long lonely night to kill my dreams alas;tears will shower again and dreams too will shatter,” reads out poet Tariq AhmadTariq, referring to his life during the Covid-19 lockdown.The virus outbreak that kept all creative souls confined indoors in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) has led to an outpouring of feelings and emotions now taking the form of poetry that’s going online. Not surprisingly then, virtual poetry sessions or mushairas have now become a part of life here.“We have organised six full-fledged mushairas, songs, skits, magic shows (since the lockdown) and plan to carry out similar activities in the near future,’’ says Muneer Raquib, secretary, J&K Academy of Art, Culture, and Languages.Such sessions first started with singing performances in different languages, and then poets requested online readings, which were arranged in cooperation with various cultural organisations of the Valley.The Covid-19 lockdown actually helped the academy cement plans to go online. “From the last one year the academy had plans to switch over to online and virtual sessions to reach a bigger audience, especially the younger generation. The lockdown has given us that opportunity. We have asked people too to use our facilities to reach their audiences.’’ Two days ago, one of the oldest cultural organisations in J&K, Rafiabad Adbi Markaz, along with the academy, held a joint online poetic session in which more than 17 poets from various parts of Kashmir participated.Mohammad Ashraf Tak, chief editor of the academy, said the role of literary organisations in the state to ensure the success of the online platform was important as cultural events remained suspended for months across the Valley. “This is the beginning and more programmes and projects are in the offing,’’ Tak added.Many poets and writers have written about Covid-19 and its deadly impact on day-to-day activities. “The sessions attract knowledgeable audience that cheer the creativity of the poets. For us, it is lockdown literature,’’ said Rafiq Masoodi, a former secretary of the academy.Not only, this many poets are now regularly updating their work in English, Urdu, Hindi and Kashmiri on social media, with many focusing on Covid-19, giving people the hope that such times will not last long.“It is not easy to conduct mushairas using 2G phone connections, but we have managed to successfully hold such events,” says Tajamul, a participant in a poetic session.Athar Bashir, a young poet who is adept at using social media said the lockdown had helped them write about “things happening around us. Through social media we can share our literary work with a cross-section of society and it’s encouraging when it reaches larger audiences, especially the younger generation. Also, it helps us maintain social distancing.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-covid-19-lockdown-poetry-flowers-virtually-in-valley/story-TsIIGILIv7a31PQfYoCnwM.html
03-06-2020||Mumbai||Airports come up with ways to keep ops smooth in Mumbai||City’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) along with Juhu airport has placed a contingency plan to tackle cyclone Nisarga. A majority of the flights were cancelled by airlines due to the cyclone on Wednesday. Instead of 25 departures and 25 arrivals, only 8 arrivals and 11 departures were scheduled.A statement by the Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) said, “In the wake of cyclone Nisarga, CSMIA convened a meeting with its stakeholders to devise preventive measures to tackle potential adversities accompanied by the cyclone. Preventive checks at different airport functions have been carried out and the airport has ensured uninterrupted power supply. Water pumps have been positioned across the airport to clear water in case of waterlogging and food and beverage counters will be operational 24/7 at the airport for passengers.” Sources from CSMIA said that the small aircraft parked at the airport have been interlocked (tied close to each other) for their safety.“Around 15 aircraft parked at CSMIA do not have hangars, in such cases, the airlines have been given an option to fly their aircraft and park them in any other airport, if suitable,” said the source. A dedicated team has been placed on standby at the airport to assist amid cyclone.“Special precautions have been taken for smaller and lighter aircraft as they are vulnerable to strong winds. Some aircraft have flown out of Mumbai until the cyclone passes while others have been asked to park inside the hangar. The airport has ensured that minimum aircraft are parked on the apron. The airport is closely coordinating with IMD to monitor the progress/dissipation of adverse weather,” the statement said.Operators at Juhu airport too have shifted all the helicopters in their respective hangars. Juhu airport director Ashok Kumar Verma said, “We are prepared to face the cyclone as we have not only taken care of our helicopters but also cleaned our drainage system in order to keep our airfield operational. We also have put in place pumping stations to remove all the accumulated water, if any, from the low lying area of the airport.” Juhu airport handles around 120 helicopter and charter aircraft movements per day. However, after the lockdown, it is currently handling around 50 movements. A Pawan Hans official said that currently they operate four helicopters everyday (for ONGC) and have continued to schedule them on Wednesday too. However, the decision on flying operations will be taken based on the weather conditions on Wednesday morning. Stakeholders at CSMIA have also made arrangements for additional ground staff at the airport. “Measures have been taken to have sufficient staff at the airport for the smooth functioning of flight operations which include airport, airlines, security and air traffic staff. This is in case the other set of staff are unable to reach the airport on Wednesday due to the cyclone,” said an airport official. The aviation regulator — Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) too issued a circular to airline operators and pilots to re-iterate the existing guidelines and bring awareness on adverse weather and monsoon operations. DGCA asked the airline operators to operate with pilots a level higher than the minimum experience, especially in cases where both crew members are operating after a long gap in flying. The operators were also asked to ensure the flight duty time limit (FDTL) requirements for crew should not be exceeded more than the approved limit by the DGCA. “Runway surface condition and effect of the same on aircraft performance should be understood and taken into account for performance. Selection of a suitable destination alternate is also an important aspect during adverse and monsoon conditions,” the DGCA stated. DGCA also asked the airlines to understand and decide their fuel availability before their flight before it starts to descend or diverts due to bad weather. In adverse weather, a stabilised approach is the first step towards a safe landing, the DGCA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-airports-prepare-for-cyclone-nisarga/story-vArV58TR0gmRwnnhmWlh1K.html
03-06-2020||Mumbai||How Mumbai steered clear of cyclones||Despite cyclones frequently forming in the Arabian Sea, Mumbai has been shielded from being directly hit by these weather systems thanks to what climate scientists describe as steering winds and a subtropical ridge.Steering winds are way above the earth’s surface and control the movement of weather systems. In case of a cyclone, these upper-level winds steer the cyclone in the direction that they are flowing. “Cyclones in the Arabian Sea are mostly formed in the central Arabian Sea. The reason Mumbai has been shielded is because they [cyclones] do not form close to the coast. Even if they do form close to the coast, they move towards Oman, Yemen or Somalia because of upper-level steering winds that move from east to west,” said Sridhar Balasubramanian, associate professor, department of mechanical engineering and associated faculty, IDP in Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. Looking at cyclone Nisarga making landfall south of Mumbai and last year’s severe cyclonic storm Vayu, professor Raghu Murtugudde, from University of Maryland’s department of atmospheric and oceanic science, said the possibility of a change in the steering wind pattern could be a factor.“Something is changing about these winds, given last year cyclone Vayu and this year Nisarga have come straight to the coast,” said Murtugudde, who is currently in Mumbai. “My guess is that [ocean] warming has weakened the steering wind in a way that the direction of cyclones will probably begin to change. Overall, this dynamic change is in response to global warming, which is similar to observations of a slight weakening and changes in monsoon circulation.”Mumbai has also evaded being hit by cyclones in the past because of a high-pressure zone called the subtropical ridge. “Normally, during the pre-monsoon season, the subtropical ridge acts as a barrier and doesn’t allow the cyclone to come towards us,” said Balasubramanian. “The cyclone moves along the line of the ridge, which is usually over Mumbai-Gujarat and therefore the system ends up towards the Gulf.”Taking into account the probability of climate change-driven increase in pre-monsoon cyclones hitting the coastline, Murtugudde said that going forward, policy makers must incorporate cyclone-level storm surge and inundation in the city’s disaster management plan. “There is a need to modify the plan that goes beyond flooding to factor in the consequences of the ocean being pulled into the city. Policy makers need to keep in mind that a one-in-100-year event can begin to occur once in 20 years,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/how-mumbai-steered-clear-of-cyclones/story-LKPqsXxe1beBuyL6DdhX7K.html
03-06-2020||Mumbai||‘Coastal flooding is major threat after cyclone’||In an email interview with Hindustan Times, Jonathan E Martin, professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences, University of Wisconsin–Madison, USA, spoke about the impact of Cyclone Nisarga over Mumbai, which is expected to make landfall 19 km south of the city on Wednesday. Martin has carried out extensive research for almost 30 years on the evolution of cyclones across the world.Will Cyclone Nisarga cause severe damage to Mumbai’s infrastructure?Cyclone Nisarga is likely to develop into a major tropical storm and may possess sustained winds of 35 mph (56-60 kmph) over Mumbai on Wednesday. Such winds can damage tall buildings, but our experience in the US shows that such damage is often not drastic. We suffer much more substantial damage with hurricane-force winds (at or above 120 kmph). Nevertheless, winds will be destructive to structures in a major city like Mumbai.Has Mumbai ever witnessed a cyclone landfall in history?This storm may be the first tropical cyclone to strike Mumbai or move very close to the city in 129 years. However, there are stray reports of a cyclone landfall near Mumbai in 1948 and one that was quite close in 2009.What are some of the most critical measures to be taken while tackling intense cyclones?Coastal flooding is a major threat from a hurricane landfall. The biggest errors in the past have involved lack of adequate evacuation plans which often traps large numbers of people in desperate situations during flooding. The impact of flooding on the most impoverished areas of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region needs to be the primary response. Providing adequate shelter for those who are displaced by such floods is very important for recovery.Are pre-monsoon and post-monsoon cyclones increasing in the Arabian Sea?Cyclones preferentially form in the eastern portion of the Arabian Sea as opposed to the western portion as the waters are much warmer in the east and warm sea surface temperature is a key ingredient for cyclone formation. Considering storms that eventually affect the Arabian Peninsula, there is a slight increase in their frequency over the last 40 years (two in the year 1980, six in 1990, five in 2000 and 12 in 2010) but this trend needs to be further studied.Are tropical storms intensifying much faster which climate models are failing to identify?Rising sea surface temperatures encourage more frequent and more intense tropical cyclone development. Modern numerical forecast models including those used by the Indian Meteorological Department is generally quite good at tropical cyclone forecasting. Some developments are missed by these models, but since the storms have life cycles of over a week, even if the models miss their initial development they catch on during the lifecycle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coastal-flooding-is-major-threat-after-cyclone/story-XioMxrBOVOwGEiHzIcmEfM.html
03-06-2020||Mumbai||My kid thinks a monster will appear from sea: Fisherman in Alibag||A 30-year-old fisherman, Ganesh Kashnath Lohar, who resides 500-metres from the Arabian Sea coast close to Mandwa jetty in Alibag, was surprised to see four boats and 13 men in formals standing close to the shoreline on Tuesday morning. On consulting with other fishermen, he learnt that they were officials from the Maharashtra Maritime Board, district collector’s office and National Disaster Response Force who were assessing the level of storm surge in the region.“We had only heard about devastating impacts that cyclones had caused in south Konkan but now, based on warnings issued by district officials, we are expecting to witness it first hand,” said Lohar as it started heavily in the region. “My daughter is frightened as if a monster from the sea is going to appear but we have calmed her down telling her its just loud thunder and rain. Nothing more. But we ourselves don’t know what to expect after hearing stories from friends how fishermen were affected off the coast of Bengal (during cyclone Amphan),” he added.Though Lohar did not know what the name of the cyclone was, he said owing to the “Chakrivadal” (cyclone), he was asked to pull his boat out of the sea, and park it closer to his home.“Our entire village has pucca structures, thus nobody was relocated from here. An announcement was made in the village on Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning directing us to keep doors and windows shut when rain commences from Tuesday afternoon onwards.” Lohar lives with his wife, daughter and mother in a one-room house. “First it was the lockdown that restricted fishing for almost the entire month of March, and then when we began fishing for just over a month, now a cyclone is coming. There have been a lot of losses for us this year but the safety of my daughter is of prime concern for me,” he said adding, “A few fishermen even went fishing within a 2-km radius on Tuesday but the coast guard sent them back within an hour of their departure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/my-kid-thinks-a-monster-will-appear-from-sea-fisherman-in-alibag/story-N7FrNPARBcFJX5z3ch48KI.html
03-06-2020||Mumbai||Cyclone during Covid: Stormy weather for BMC||Already reeling under the pressure of handling the pandemic, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday scrambled to activate its disaster response plan in the face of the likely landfall of Cyclone Nisarga near Alibaug on Wednesday.Mumbai is likely to experience extremely heavy rain and high speed winds due to the cyclone. It could impact slums, informal settlements, power and water supply, besides causing flooding and tree falls, etc. BMC announced by Tuesday evening that it had identified localities at high risk due to strong winds, low-lying areas likely to be inundated and residents who needed to be moved to safe shelters being readied in municipal schools. So far, other than the 150 Covid-19 patients residing in field facilities, evacuees have not been shifted.Moreover, the civic body’s emergency helpline for disaster response and Covid-19 related help for patient and bed management - 1916 - operated via 60-odd hotlines from the main disaster control room at BMC headquarters in Fort stopped working on Tuesday evening. It started to work late at night. Officers from the disaster management department remained unavailable for comment. A senior civic officer said, “The overall preparedness is good because we were getting ready for the monsoon. Trees have been trimmed, dewatering pumps are active, along with measures to handle inundation in low-lying areas. Evacuation plan for residents living along Mithi is activated, landslide-prone areas and dilapidated buildings have been identified.”However, details of the location of the safe shelters, identified and rescued evacuees remained unavailable. In a press release, BMC said municipal commissioner IS Chahal has instructed all ward officers to identify evacuees and safe shelters, and prepare evacuation plans.Assistant commissioners of at least three wards that HT spoke to confirmed that all preparations were being made, but evacuees were not actually moved to safe shelters. This will be done if it is absolutely necessary.An officer said, “I have identified evacuees, and have two-three schools ready as shelters. But social distancing is a must. So they are safe in their homes also. They will be moved immediately if it appears cyclonic conditions are worsening.”BMC, however, moved 150 odd Covid-19 patients from its temporary jumbo facility constructed at the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BMC) to the NSCI dome at Worli, and the NESCO exhibition grounds at Goregaon. A senior civic officer said, “Structural stability of all temporary Covid Care Centres, or health facilities is being checked. But the one at BKC is constructed temporarily in an open ground, to house Covid-19 patients. Other jumbo facilities are in existing buildings.”In a statement, MMRDA that constructed the facility on its BKC ground, said, “Although the Covid-19 hospital can sustain strong winds of up to 80km-100km per hour, with human lives at stake, as a precautionary measure, all patients (about 150) from the hospital are being shifted by BMC.”Chahal also instructed all BMC officers to move Covid-19 patients from such temporary erected facilities if necessary, upon conducting stability tests on the structures.BMC also issued an advisory of dos and don’ts for all Mumbaiites on Tuesday with general instructions on how to stay safe during cyclonic conditions. The civic body also issued a notice to all construction sites to prevent accidents such as dislodging of cranes/scaffolding, possibility of roof blowing away, falling of any construction material, or anything likely to cause damage to human life and property especially which the gusty winds forecast. The notice said, “In case of any such accident which may cause damage to the properties/human lives because of any negligence on your part, you will be held responsible.”Meanwhile, the Mumbai fire brigade activated its standard operating procedure on Wednesday. Equipped to handle disasters such as tree collapse, house collapse, fires due to short circuit, land slide, and floods due to monsoon, the Mumbai fire brigade said all 35 fire stations are on high alert for disaster response, with 150 personnel on stand-by. It also said 63 fire engines fitted with hydraulic, electrical and mechanical gears for cutting, lifting, spreading, and quenching are on stand-by, along with five rescue vans equipped with pneumatic lifting bags, portable chain saws, various cutters, portable generators, flood lights, and stretchers.For beach safety, the fire brigade has stationed 96 lifeguards at the six beaches in Mumbai - Girgaum, Dadar, Versova, Juhu, Aksa, and Gorai, with five jet skis, six boats, six kayaks, and two floating stretchers for rescue.Mumbai will also have eight teams from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) on standby. Three of these teams are already stationed at Andheri, while five more were flown to Mumbai from Vishakhapatnam on Tuesday afternoon. Each team has 45 personnel, and equipment such as tree and pole cutters, rescue boats, life jackets, rescue ropes, breathing apparatus, floaters and life buoys.In a meeting with Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray, Chahal, and other bureaucrats in the civic body on Tuesday, the municipal commissioner informed Thackeray that in light of possibility of torrential rains, dewatering pumps have been installed at potential water storage sites; notices have been issued to all contractors concerned to secure cranes at infrastructure construction sites; lifeguards have been deployed at various intersections and equipment like rescue boats and jet skis have been deployed for flood relief. The department offices have been directed to hold an emergency meeting to ensure there is no risk, the release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/will-cyclone-impact-onset-of-monsoon/story-nueKRgEScspx5rTcBtOMgI.html

03-06-2020||Mumbai||Cyclone Nisarga: 65,000 people living close to coast of Maharashtra evacuated||With the Cyclone Nisarga likely to hit the coastal parts of the state on Wednesday afternoon, the authorities have evacuated more than 65,000 people living close to the coast of Maharashtra. Of them, 35,000 are in Raigad, 21,080 in Palghar, over 5,000 in Ratnagiri and 1,586 in Sindhudurg.Seven coastal districts of Maharashtra – Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Raigad, Thane, Mumbai City, Mumbai Suburban and Palghar– have been put on alert. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has deployed 20 teams – 8 teams in Mumbai, 4 in Raigad, two each in Palghar, Thane and Ratnagiri and one each in Navi Mumbai and Sindhudurg. Four teams of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), too, have been deployed in these districts, while one NDRF team is on standby. An NDRF team comprises 35-45 jawans, depending on the severity in the region.“Guhagar, Dapoli and Mandangad in Ratnagiri are expected to be the worst-hit. We have identified schools and colleges for evacuation and adequate stock of food grain and other essential commodities has been kept ready,” said an official from the district collectorate.Ratnagiri collector Laxminarayan Mishra said the government will made arrangements for food and shelter for people if their houses are damaged in the cyclone before they are rehabilitated. After the change in the forecast that projected the landfall of the Cyclone Nisarga at Alibaug, instead of the earlier Harihareshwar in Raigad district, two more teams of NDRF have been deployed at Alibaug. “Two more teams of NDRF are deployed at Murud and Shrivardhan,” said Bharat Shitole, resident deputy collector of Raigad.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, too, appealed to citizens to not step out of their homes on Wednesday and Thursday. He asked establishments, which had started operations in the past few days, to remain shut for two days. In a notification issued on Sunday, the state had said that public gardens can open from Wednesday, but Thackeray appealed to citizens to stay indoors.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also called Thackeray. “He has assured us of help from the Centre,” Thackeray said in his live address to citizens. He asked citizens to take precautions. “Keep your phones and emergency lights charged. Keep all your essentials, including medicines, at a safe, accessible place. Make sure you store drinking water and avoid unnecessary usage of electricity, as there might be chances of a power cut owing to heavy rain,” he said. He also asked citizens to not venture near dilapidated buildings or temporary sheds and identify a corner in the house where they can take refuge during gusty winds. He asked citizens to collect loose items near the house and tie it together or keep it at home, so it doesn’t cause any mishap.Meanwhile, the Palghar district collectorate has identified 21 villages that are vulnerable and 21,080 of its residents are expected to be evacuated. “Most of the families are shifting to their relatives’ homes in safer areas. We have identified 85 places for evacuation and have made adequate arrangements,” said Kiran Mahajan, resident deputy collector.Lokesh Chandra, divisional commissioner, Konkan division, said, “The evacuation will be completed late by Tuesday night. The 13 fishing boats that are deep in the sea are expected to return by late night. We have deployed 13 NDRF teams in these districts, five of them are in Raigad and two in Palghar.”Need for social distancing owing to the pandemic may add to the challenge for the NDRF. Anupam Srivastava, NDRF Maharashtra commandant, said each jawan has been provided with a “rescuer Covid kit”, which includes a hand wash, soap, gloves, face masks and shields. They have also been provided with two biological suits, one which can be disposed of and one which can be washed. “It will be a difficult rescue operation, but we are well-prepared,” Srivastava said.NDRF teams have been conducting briefings with people to explain the damage possible from the cyclone. Five additional NDRF teams from Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh will also be airlifted and deployed in Mumbai by Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning, a senior commander from NDRF said. Officials said the Indian Coast Guard ships, aircraft and on-shore stations are continuously relaying warnings about the impending adverse weather to marine vessels and fishermen.On Tuesday, NDRF men also briefed citizens living near the coast to be alert and prepared for the cyclone. “These are people who have lived near the sea for generations. They say we have already seen these events, so it is a little difficult to convince them, but we are trying our best. We have started evacuation in Alibaug, Palghar and Sindhudurg,” Srivastava said. “Besides village-level meetings and appeal over public address system, we have formed teams of senior officials to oversee the evacuation and mitigation operation,” said Shitole.The state government has released special funds to all district collectors for relief measures. “The district collectors have been directed to undertake evacuation operation in low-lying areas that are expected to be hit the most. Machinery has been geared up in all seven districts,” said Abhay Yavalkar, director disaster management units. The state has directed evacuation of people living in kutcha, semi pucca and houses with metal roof sheets, along with their livestock. Most district collectors have imposed curfew for the next three days in the tehsils expected to be hit by the cyclone.The state cabinet met on Tuesday to discuss the impending threat of the cyclone and the measures being taken to combat it. The disaster management unit made a presentation at the meeting. “We have requested the Centre to keep the additional teams of NDRF from the neighbouring states on standby. The authorities have also been directed to ensure that Covid-19 and non-Covid hospitals do not suffer. The power supply authorities have been directed to arrange for generators for the hospital for uninterrupted health services. The cabinet was also informed that except the field hospital at Bandra-Kurla Complex, the newly erected Covid-19 field hospitals at Worli, Goregaon are safe and can sustain the cyclone as they are in pucca structures,” said a government official from the relief and rehabilitation department.Palghar district officials on Tuesday also released an order to shut shops, commercial establishments on Wednesday. It has also asked chemical factories to take precautions and practise “safe shutdown” on account of the cyclone. A state government advisory to citizens also assured that the nuclear plant at Tarapur in Palghar is safe and can withstand the impact of cyclone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cyclone-nisarga-65-000-people-living-close-to-coast-of-maharashtra-evacuated/story-tJ4iXT8Fi8MJ5gxmExTioO.html
03-06-2020||Mumbai||Will cyclone impact onset of monsoon in Maharashtra?||With the southwest monsoon expected to reach Mumbai around June 11, experts are divided over whether its onset will be impacted by cyclone Nisarga, which is the first pre-monsoon cyclone to hit Maharashtra in 59 years.On Tuesday, IMD said it didn’t expect Nisarga to delay the monsoon. “Sometimes, such large weather systems favour monsoon conditions by aiding convection and allowing the faster progression of the overall system. This is likely to happen for areas impacted by the cyclone,” said Sunitha Devi, in-charge of cyclones, IMD.Other meteorologists predicted the onset for around June 12. “Since the cyclone has formed early in the season, a delay may not happen,” said Sridhar Balasubramanian, associate professor, IDP in Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay. Mahesh Palawat, vice president of private weather forecasting agency Skymet, said the onset was expected around June 13.Generally, a cyclone is followed by a lull in monsoon progression. “This is because the cyclone changes the thermodynamic and dynamic conditions such as temperature, humidity, and circulation of the entire region. But in this case, hopefully, the southwest monsoon should reorganise soon,” said Dr. Roxy Mathew Koll, senior scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune.Last year, the onset of the monsoon over Mumbai was on June 25. It was the most delayed onset in 45 years because of the very severe cyclonic storm Vayu (June 10-17) over the Arabian Sea.Independent meteorologist and researcher at the University of Reading, Akshay Deoras believes Nisarga will delay the monsoon’s onset. “In Mumbai and the Konkan, monsoon’s arrival will perhaps be a little before June 15. This southerly wind pattern will be extremely similar to mid-June 2019 when Vayu had disturbed the monsoon’s progression,” said Deoras. He also said farmers should wait a week after June 4 before sowing crops. “The state might witness a resurgence in the rainfall activity from June 12 and the monsoon’s probable arrival in interior areas is expected after June 15. A few days before this would be the appropriate sowing period,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/will-cyclone-impact-onset-of-monsoon-in-maharashtra/story-JPKSSjIzcKIyQoWaEV89xL.html

03-06-2020||Chandigarh||GREENFIELD CONNECTIVITY: Capt govt, Harsimrat in credit war||The Capt Amarinder Singh government and Union food processing industries minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal on Tuesday claimed credit for a new Greenfield Road link to Amritsar from Nakodar via Sultanpur Lodhi, Goindwal Sahib and Khadoor Sahib announced by the Centre as part of Delhi-Amritsar Expressway.Both the Congress government and Harsimrat, who belongs to the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), said the Centre had acceded to their requests. A Punjab government spokesperson said the Centre had accepted the CM’s proposal to convert the Punjab stretch of Delhi-Amritsar-Katra expressway to ‘Greenfield project’, whereas Harsimrat Badal thanked Union highways minister Nitin Gadkari for acceding to her request to amend the alignment of the Delhi-Amritsar-Katra expressway to create a new direct link between Amritsar and Delhi.In a release, the Punjab government said the CM had raised the issue with the Centre after local citizens and their representatives expressed concern over the project’s failure to connect the religious and historical towns of Sultanpur Lodhi, Goindwal Sahib, and Tarn Taran. “During the VC today, the Union minister told the CM that, after detailed deliberations with the state government officials and examination of all aspects of the proposal, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) had approved the alignment of Phase-I of the Delhi–Amritsar–Katra Expressway with Delhi-Gurdaspur section as Greenfield project,” said the spokesperson. Amarinder has also agreed to an early meeting between NHAI and state government authorities, as suggested by Gadkari.Harsimrat Badal, while terming the decision as a “historic development”, said it had fulfilled a long standing demand of the residents of Amritsar and was also in tune with the original alignment proposed during SAD-BJP tenure.“Under the new alignment which she had proposed, the expressway will now connect the five historic Sikh shrines at Sultanpur Lodhi, Goindwal Sahib, Khadoor Sahib, Tarn Taran and Sri Amritsar Sahib,” she said in a statement. It said the Union minister also requested Gadkari to name the expressway between Nakodar and Amritsar in honour of Guru Sahiban and he assured to take this request into consideration.MALIK ALSO CLAIMS CREDITNot to be left behind, BJP Rajya Sabha MP from Amritsar Shwait Malik said that Gadkari has acceded to his request for inclusion of Amritsar in the project. Malik said that with his efforts, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gadkari and Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri got this express highway passed in 2016 as he had raised this matter in Parliament three times. “Amritsar is more in need of this express highway because it has several important religious and historic venues,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/greenfield-connectivity-capt-govt-harsimrat-in-credit-war/story-IuXM2BrzPVZfjgTgDfYVhO.html

The unpaid dues for the 2018-19 season are Rs 96.36 crore and the amount left to be paid for the 2019-20 season is Rs 585.12 crore,” the Congress leaders wrote. The letter was signed by Congress MLAs Fatehjung Singh Bajwa (Qadian), Balwinder Singh Laddi (Hargobindpur) and Joginder Pal (Bhoa).They said as per the Sugarcane Control Order and clause 3(3) of the Sugarcane Purchase and Regulation Act, the sugar mills must make payment within 14 days of purchase of sugarcane otherwise the mills will have to make these payments along with interest for the delayed period. “It is a matter of grave concern that there are outstanding payments for years. These unpaid dues have caused financial distress to thousands of sugarcane farmers, leaving many with huge debts,” reads the letter which also gives the names of nine cooperative and five private sugar mills that have pending payments.Citing the example of two private mills which have made payments for both seasons, Bajwa said if these two could pay for their goods, why the rest were unable to do so. “It is a major lapse of the government where sugar mills break the rules and regulations of the state and do not face any punishment,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bajwa-three-cong-mlas-seek-release-of-rs-681-cr-cane-arrears-to-farmers/story-QizYl0oLwOcZoBAxqDVB6N.html

In addition to it, teachers were also doing routine work such as distribution of books to children and sending day to day information required by the department.The teachers were confused and were wondering whether they should work or not. “They are working continuously from home during the lockdown and even during the summer vacation so there is no question of deduction of leave,” said Bhag Singh Kairon, JAC president.Apart from Kairon, the meeting was attended by various JAC leaders, including Savinder Singh, Ranbir Rana, Khushali Ram Sharma and Shamsher Singh. An appeal was also submitted to the education department officials to “not issue such orders which demotivate the teachers and request them to withdraw these unjustified orders as these orders have no meaning in prevailing situations,” said Kairon.When questioned, director, school education, Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “We will consider their request on merit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/orders-to-work-during-winter-break-not-justified-ut-teachers/story-pPIq2u2IiscI9qkvQ0IpxI.html

The judge presented his report to the government on 20 October, 2019, in which the discrepancies related to the purchase of the machine were confirmed.WHAT THEY SAYI have already issued a notice to the officials concerned to locate the file in three days, following which a legal action will be taken against them.

The cyclone is very likely to intensify into a “severe cyclonic storm” around 5.30am on Wednesday, and cross Maharashtra and the south Gujarat coast on Wednesday afternoon, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.The prediction is extremely heavy rain for Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and Raigad with high-speed winds, gusting to a maximum of 120kmph along the coast. The landfall site has been identified close to Alibag, Raigad district, which is 16km south of Mumbai over the sea, with extensive damage expected for Mumbai, the weather bureau said. However, private weather forecasters maintained their earlier predictions of the cyclone’s landfall in Palghar, north of Mumbai.“The major impact of the landfall over Alibag is expected around 12 noon and the impact will continue till around 3pm, which will be felt across all four districts,” said Sunitha Devi, in-charge of cyclones at India Meteorological Department (IMD).Maharashtra and Gujarat activated their disaster-response mechanisms as the two western states, which are already battling a raging pandemic that has put their health infrastructure under severe strain, deployed National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams and started evacuating people from vulnerable areas on Tuesday. In Maharashtra, authorities have started to evacuate more than 65,000 people living close to the coast. Seven coastal districts of Maharashtra – Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Raigad, Thane, Mumbai City, Mumbai Suburban and Palghar district – have been put on alert, as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray appealed to citizens to stay indoors on Wednesday and Thursday and establishments to remain shut. NDRF has deployed 20 teams – eight teams in Mumbai, four in Raigad, two each in Palghar, Thane and Ratnagiri and one each in Navi Mumbai and Sindhudurg. Four teams of State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) too have been deployed in these districts, while one NDRF team is on stand-by. These teams comprise 35-45 jawans, depending on the expected severity of the cyclone in the region.Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to chief ministers of both states and assured them all possible help from the Centre. “He has promised help from the Centre,” Thackeray said in his live address to citizens. He asked citizens to take precautions. “Keep your phones and emergency lights charged. Keep all your essentials, including medicines, at a safe and accessible place. Make sure you store drinking water and avoid unnecessary usage of electricity as there might be chances of a power cut owing to heavy rain,” he said.In Mumbai, the police have issued a prohibitory order restricting public movement of one or more persons near the coast, including on promenades at Marine Drive, Nariman Point, Bandra, Worli sea face, and at beaches and parks which are near the coastline on Wednesday and Thursday. The BMC, too, has started its preparations, said a senior civic official, adding that a team of ward officials is being sent to coastal areas, where they are making announcements on safety measures. The BMC’s official Twitter handle has also put out a list of ‘dos and don’ts’.The weather system, currently a cyclonic storm, was located about 310km south-southwest of Mumbai, and 270km south-southwest of Alibag. It is likely to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm by 5.30am on Wednesday. Maximum wind speed is expected to range between 100-110 kmph on Wednesday afternoon (expected landfall), gusting to 120 kmph along Mumbai coast.“The current trajectory of the system shows landfall over Raigad district, just scraping the south of Mumbai, which is likely to impact the financial capital with the possibility of extremely heavy rain and high-speed winds,” said Devi.“Authorities across all four districts — Mumbai, Thane, Raigad and Palghar — have been warned about the severity of the weather event as all four districts are expected to be affected when the severe cyclonic storm moves closer to landfall on Wednesday afternoon.”Meanwhile, the city and suburbs recorded light to moderate showers from 5pm onwards on Tuesday. Between 5.30pm and 8.30pm, south Mumbai recorded 18.6 mm (moderate) rain, while 11 mm (light) rain was recorded in south Mumbai. Moderate wind speed of 10-12 knots was recorded at south Mumbai.On Monday morning, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had expected the landfall over Palghar district (north of Mumbai), but based on studying the trajectory of the system, revised their prediction by Monday evening.Meanwhile, private weather forecasting agency Skymet on Tuesday said they still expected landfall over Palghar district. “Our weather models are showing landfall north of Mumbai with a crucial period of extremely heavy rain and gale winds expected from Tuesday evening to Wednesday afternoon,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet. “Heavy rain over Mumbai will have the potential for intense flooding.”The IMD’s latest bulletin issued warnings for the expected storm surge and damage expected across four districts — Mumbai, Thane, Raigad and Ratnagiri — for Wednesday. “Storm surge of about 1-2m above astronomical tide (tidal characteristics associated with gravitational effects) is very likely to inundate low-lying areas of Mumbai, Thane and Raigad districts, and 0.5-1m height above the astronomical tide likely to inundate low-lying areas of Ratnagiri district during the time of landfall,” the IMD release said.Major damage was expected for thatched houses, huts and those with unattached metal sheets as rooftops, which are located across several areas in the Mumbai slums, which may blow away due to high speed winds, the IMD bulletin said, adding that there was expected damage to power and communication lines, breaking of tree branches. Uprooting of large avenue trees, damage to banana and papaya trees , large dead limbs blown from trees, major damage to coastal crops, damage to embankments and salt pans were some of the other warnings.Dr Roxy Mathew Koll, senior scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, said if landfall happens over Raigad, maximum rainfall is expected over northern regions (Mumbai). “Not just the direct impact of winds, but forecasts indicate heavy rain up to 200mm, while the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services has forecasted storm surges with waves of 3-6m as the cyclone approaches landfall,” he said. “If this happens during high tide on June 3 then flooding will be a major concern for a city that is already clogged.”Dr Koll pointed out that natural defences such as mangroves and river flood plains had been constructed on many parts of the city for infrastructure and real estate, giving rise to prolonged inundation concerns.Other experts said that in order to respond to such extreme weather events, there was need to develop a granular understanding of climate risks at the state, district, and city levels. “Cyclone Nisarga could severely test the climate resilience of infrastructure in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra. Given our vulnerability to climate change, the tail-end risks of today could become more frequent and more intense in future with severe economic and security consequences. Restoration of natural ecosystems must be prioritised. We also need to evolve our emergency preparedness beyond ‘disaster management’ and build resilient physical and digital infrastructure, strengthen training given to relief personnel, and inculcate social and behavioural changes in citizens and communities,” said Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive officer, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).In times of social distancing, it is going to be a difficult and different rescue operation in Maharashtra for NDRF. A commander said the jawans have, however, been preparing to battle monsoon amid the Covid-19 outbreak and adequate measures have been taken. Anupam Srivastava, NDRF Maharashtra commandant, said that each jawan has been provided a “rescuer Covid kit”, which includes a hand-wash, soap, gloves, face masks and shields. They have also been provided with two biological suits, one which can be disposed of and one which can be washed. “It will be a difficult rescue operation, but we are well-prepared,” Srivastava said. On Tuesday, NDRF men were also briefing citizens living near the coast to be alert and prepared for the cyclone. “These are people who have lived near the sea for generations. They say we have already seen these events, so it is a little difficult to convince them, but we are trying our best. We have started evacuation in Alibaug, Palghar and Sindhudurg,” he said.

03-06-2020||Mumbai||Maha tally at 72,300, but unlocking begins||After 71 days, Maharashtra will allow its citizens to walk, run, exercise and cycle at open spaces, playgrounds and sports complexes from today, as the government eases lockdown restrictions on Wednesday, when the first phase of state’s three-phase ‘Mission Begin Again’ kicks in. The government has allowed relaxations, including opening of markets and private offices in red zones, but not in containment zones, even as 2,287 new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases were reported on Tuesday, pushing the infection count to 72,300. Of the fresh infections, 38,493 are active cases, which accounts for 53.24% of the total cases, according to the state health department.However, despite the scheduled lifting of curbs, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray appealed to people to stay indoors in view of Cyclone Nisarga, which is likely to make landfall by Wednesday afternoon. Mumbai is likely to be affected by the cyclone.“Although, we have decided to give relaxations from tomorrow, it will be in the interest of everyone to stay at home tomorrow and day after as we all know the cyclone is likely to come at Alibaug (near Mumbai). Everything will remain closed for two days, including industries,” Thackeray said in his live address to the state on Tuesday evening.On Tuesday, it also reported 103 deaths. The toll stands at 2,465. Of them, 38 deaths are from past two days, while the rest are between May 1 to May 30, clarified the health department.Last Friday, the state had recorded 116 fatalities, highest so far. However, the government had clarified that 70 of them were from past 13 days.Of 103 deaths, 49 are in Mumbai, 10 each in Mira Bhayander and Pune, six each in Raigad, Satara, five in Solapur, four each in Navi Mumbai, Panvel, three each in Sangli and Akola and one each in Thane, Nashik and Ahmednagar.Of the deaths, 59 were of above 60 years of age, while 39 were in the age group of 40 to 59 years and the remaining five were below the age of 40 years. Of the deceased, 69 had high-risk co-morbidities, including diabetes, hypertension and heart ailments, health officials said.Mumbai also recorded 1,117 new cases on Saturday and its case count stands at 42,216. Of them, 23,629 are active cases. The city’s toll stands at 1,368.On May 22, Mumbai had reported its highest one-day jump in cases — 1,751.Officials said that the cases are likely to surge for a few more days after which they are expecting decline in numbers. “We are concerned that with more relaxations, more people will step out and get exposed to the virus. This ultimately will result in asurge in cases. We are already experiencing a rise in cases in the districts where there were no cases or were minimal in number before relaxations were given in the state on May 20,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said, “We are of the opinion that the trend will continue till the sixth incubation cycle of 14 days is completed, after which the decline in cases will start.”The sixth incubation cycle will be completed on June 14.In the state cabinet meeting held on Tuesday, the state health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas informed that 35.23%, of the total patients in the country are in the state and the recovery rate of the state is 43.33%. He also said that maximum 40% of patients are in the age group of 30-40 years, while 18% patients are in the age group of 40-50 years and 16.5% patients are in the age group of 50-60 years.After the Centre announced its guidelines on lockdown 5.0 billed as ‘Unlock 1’, allowing for significant relaxations, the state government on Sunday announced more relaxations that will be applicable in three phases starting from June 3.According to the state’s notification, physical activities, including walking, running, exercising, cycling, can begin from June 3 in sports complexes, stadia, playgrounds, beaches and open spaces. From June 5, shops, market places can be open (on odd-even basis) and from June 8 private offices (up to 10 per cent of staff) can start operating. The relaxations are applicable for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) (the areas governed by nine municipal corporations including Mumbai) Pune, Solapur, Aurangabad, Malegaon, Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Akola, Amravati and Nagpur — the 19 corporations, which have been earmarked as red zones. All the containment zones within the red zones remain excluded from the relaxations.The non-red zone areas, which include the remaining eight municipal corporations and rest of Maharashra, mostly covering the rural areas, have already been given greater relaxations. All markets, market areas and shops, except malls and market complexes, have now been allowed to open on a P1-P2 basis between 9am and 5pm. Shops on one lane will be allowed to open on odd dates, while another lane will be opened on even dates.Private offices in all the red zones can now operate at 10% of their strength, with the remaining staff working from home. “The offices will have to take care of transportation facilities for its employees as public transport has not been allowed in red zones,” said a government official. Government offices have been allowed to operate with 15% of their strength of the staff, up from the current permission of 5%. “It is the beginning of the lifting of curbs in a phased manner. Although we have extended the lockdown till June 30, there will be graded relaxations coming in the next four weeks. Industrial and commercial activities will see greater relaxations on the need-base criterion. Few more civic corporations may see exclusion from red zones,” said another official, wishing not to be namedIt, however, has also extended lockdown till June 30, which means trains, metro, inter-district transport, educational institutions, malls, multiplexes, please of worship, political-religious-social gatherings, barber shops, spas, saloons will remain closed across the state, irrespective of the zones.Meanwhile, the state cabinet reviewed the situation arising due to the Covid-19 outbreak on Tuesday. Considering problem being faced by the staff related to the emergency services, it was decided to follow up with the Centre to starting local trains only for them, said a minister, privy to the development.BMC commissioner IS Chahal also gave a presentation and stated that they have decided to make it mandatory for the laboratories to give Covid-19 test reports in 24 hours. The doubling rate of the cases also rose to 19 days in the city. Some 3,750 private doctors have agreed to serve the city and are being trained for the task.The health department declared to have conducted 4,83,875 tests at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra. Of them, 4,11,575 people tested negative, said an official. State currently has 3,730 active containment zones. A total of 19,019 survey teams, comprising doctors and assisting staff, have screened more than 71.61 lakh people.So far, 35,097 people have been kept in institutional quarantine in the state and over 5,70,453 people have been put under home quarantine.The mortality rate has also slightly increased to 3.40% (2,465 deaths on June 2) from 3.27% (1,792 deaths on May 26). It is also more than the national mortality rate, which is 2.83%, with 5,394 deaths till Sunday, stated the data shared by the state health department.However, the state has also succeeded in bringing down the mortality rate significantly from last month. On April 13, the mortality rate of the state was 7.41%. (148 deaths). This indicates improvement of 4.4%, the data shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-tally-at-72-300-but-unlocking-begins/story-aZmLejLUctHMh3isLKJRfO.html
03-06-2020||Mumbai||Copyright extends to theme, plot and storyline of a literary work: HC||The Bombay high court (HC) has held that in the case of literary works, copyright extends not only to expression of the core idea but also to its theme, plot, and storyline.The order, which was pronounced on Friday, was in regards to a plea filed by Urdu writer Shamoil Ahmad Khan claiming that Falguni Shah and two others had infringed his copyright on one of his short stories, ‘Singardan’ and produced a web series under the same title which was being aired on online platforms. Khan claimed that producers of the web series had not only copied his title, but also the entire plot, narrative, and characters of his story.Producers of the web series opposed his plea for an injunction, claiming that except for the central idea of ‘Singardaan’, there was no other similarity between Khan’s literary work and the web series. They claimed that the central idea, set during riots, about a man taking a dressing table from a brothel to his home and how its use leads to changes in the behaviour of the womenfolk at home, was not entitled to any copyright protection.They submitted that the depiction of the central idea in the web series, scene to scene, situation to situation, in-climax to anti-climax, including the pathos, texture, treatment, purport, and presentation, was materially different from Khan’s story and therefore, there was no question of infringement.The argument, however, failed to impress upon justice SC Gupte. The judge agreed that that copyright does not extend to ideas, schemes, systems, or methods and it is confined to their expression; and if the expression is not copied, the copyright is not infringed.However, he clarified that in a literary work, a germ of an idea is developed into a theme and then into a plot and then finally a story, with the help of characters and settings. It is the combination of all these elements which give substance to the work. “If one goes on stripping the final work of these various elements, one may finally come to the bare idea or abstraction which no longer enjoys copyright protection,” Gupte said.“The narration is the life and blood of the plaintiff’s [Khan’s] story,” said the judge, adding that it cannot be said that the writer has copyright only in the details of expression.“If someone steals this theme, plot, and storyline, is he not thereby plagiarising the expression of the plaintiff’s work? Can the theme, plot, and storyline be simply dismissed as non-protectable ideas of the plaintiff’s work and not its expression? I think not. We have not yet reached that level of extraction where the work can be stripped to its non-protectable idea,” the judge said.Gupte concluded that though the producers of the web series developed Khan’s theme, plot, and storyline differently, prima facie it was a case of copyright infringement. The court restrained the producers from making any further adaptation of ‘Singardaan’ and directed them to maintain accounts of the revenue earned from the web series, right from its inception till the disposal of Khan’s suit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/copyright-extends-to-theme-plot-and-storyline-of-a-literary-work-hc/story-F9aKE5UPzCxHyPwkx7lqFN.html
03-06-2020||Mumbai||BMC issues circular on lockdown relief in 3 phases||Even as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray made a plea to citizens to stay indoors in view of the Cyclone Nisarga, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) late on Tuesday evening issued detailed guidelines to ease restrictions in Mumbai, as part of lockdown 5.0 in light of the Covid-19 outbreak. In tandem with the Maharashtra government’s ‘Mission Begin Again’ announced on May 31, BMC has allowed easing of restrictions in a three-phased manner, from June 3, June 5 and June 8. Municipal commissioner IS Chahal, who issued the circular, said, “We will follow government orders.” He implied that people should stay at home for two to three days during which the cyclone is expected to make landfall in Mumbai. From June 3, outdoor recreational activities such as jogging, cycling, running, and walking in open public spaces, parks, and playgrounds will be allowed, along with opening of government offices with 15% staff, or 15 staff members, whichever is lower, and businesses such as garages for motor repairs. From June 5, markets, market areas and shops, except malls or shopping complexes, will be opened between 9am and 5pm, along with plying of taxis, auto-rickshaws and cabs for essential purposes. From June 8, private offices will be allowed to operate with 10% staff, while the remaining staff will work from home. These relaxations will not apply to containment zones, where only essential services of medical and grocery stores will remain open. The periphery of containment zones will be defined strictly by respective ward officers and no one can enter or exit a containment zone, except for medical emergencies, the circular read. It also advises pregnant women and elderly citizens to stay home. The circular allows outdoor activities from June 3 strictly between 5am and 7am. Group activities will not be allowed. Children must be accompanied by adults. Also, people can undertake such recreational activity only in their neighbourhoods, and long-distance travelling is not allowed. Shops and markets will be allowed to remain open on the condition that they are open on either side of the road on alternate days. All shops and markets will remain shut on Sunday.

03-06-2020||Chandigarh||Paddy cultivation in full swing in Karnal villages||Cultivation of water-guzzling paddy is in full swing in several Karnal villages despite government’s orders banning the transplantation before June 15. Farmers could be seen pumping out groundwater and flooding their fields in Samora, Ramba, Salaru, Darar, Churni and Bibipur villages of Indri and Karnal. Most of them claimed they weren’t worried about any action against them and were ready to pay the fine of Rs 133 per day per acre than delaying the paddy sowing.They said they have to clear their fields in September to grow vegetables, which is why most of them sow early varieties of paddy and begin the transplantation in the last week of May and first week of June. “These farmers own acres of land and are politically connected. It is difficult for officials to take action against them. That is why they start transplantation in the first week of June every year,” said a labourer working for a farmer in Ramba village, pleading anonymity. Karnal deputy director (agriculture) Aditya Dabas said some farmers had gone for early transplantation fearing labour shortage. “It is difficult to uproot the paddy sown at this scale, but I believe that imposing a penalty is a better option. We have decided to charge a fine of Rs 133 per day for per acre of transplantation and have issued notices to 57 farmers,” he added. Dabas said notices will be issued to the erring farmers and the fine will be added to their revenue records which will be chargeable whenever they visit their tehsil office. VIOLATION OF SUBSOIL WATER ACT The advanced sowing has also exposed negligence on the part of ground-level officials as these farmers have also violated the Haryana Preservation of Subsoil Water Act by preparing nursery beds before May 15. A nursery takes 25 to 30 days before saplings are ready for transplantation. Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said, “A committee comprising the local halqa patwari, sarpanch, a policeman and an official from agriculture department will conduct a village-to-village survey and the transplanted crop will be destroyed to leave strong message.” As per a recent research carried out by Karnal-based Central Soil Salinity Research Institute, flood-based irrigation is putting enormous stress on the groundwater supplies and paddy alone consumes about 50% of the overall irrigation water. The research revealed that the yearly dip of about 3ft in groundwater table in north-west India between 1973 and 2001 had multiplied five times between 2000 and 2006 in central Punjab and parts of Haryana. During 2008-2012, total freshwater withdrawals in India were about 761 billion cubic metre of which, about 90% was used for agriculture, the report stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/paddy-cultivation-in-full-swing-in-karnal-villages/story-PuYZ1TKVFfC5VsMSrbtatM.html

This put parents in unnecessary hardship, he had told the court.The bench observed that the UT administration had already passed orders giving specific directions to private schools not to take any coercive steps against students in case of non-payment of fee.The bench disposed of the plea observing that adequate arrangement for accommodating students and parents unable to deposit fees has already been made. Therefore, no further direction was required to be issued in the matter, the bench added.The court, however, gave liberty to individual parents and students to approach the schools, the grievance redressal authority, or even the UT administration in case of any hardship.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/schools-can-t-strike-off-students-names-over-non-payment-of-tuition-fee-chandigarh-admn-tells-hc/story-AUQYVuvedq5cs1DEBZQraM.html
03-06-2020||Mumbai||State issues show-cause notice to 4 hospitals for violating Covid-19 orders||The state government on Tuesday issued show-cause notices to four major hospitals in the city for violating its guidelines for the treatment of Covid-19. In a separate development, following the state cabinet’s approval, Maharashtra became the first state in India to extend health insurance that covers Covid-19 to all its citizens.Late on Monday, state health minister Rajesh Tope had made a surprise visit to the four private hospitals. During this inspection, he found the hospitals were flouting the rules laid down for treatment of Covid-19 patients, some of whom were made to wait despite less than 50% occupancy of hospital beds. “We found the hospitals had not put up boards specifying availability of beds and treatment charges for Covid-19. A few hospitals had sufficient beds, but they chose to keep Covid-19 patients waiting,” said Tope, adding that strict action will be taken against the hospitals for their non-compliance.On May 22, the state decided to reserve 80% of beds in all private hospitals in the city to tackle the shortage of beds for Covid-19 patients. Following reports of patients being charged exorbitant fees at private hospitals, the state health department also issued an order that capped Covid-19 treatment charges at private hospitals and required hospitals to put up boards with details of available beds and the treatment charges. Restrictions were also imposed on billing of medicines.In a state cabinet meeting on Tuesday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray directed the state administration to appoint civic officials in private hospitals to monitor the situation. “This will ensure patients won’t have to face difficulties,” said Thackeray.The state cabinet also approved its free health insurance scheme being extended to all citizens of the state, making Maharashtra the first state in India to take this initiative. Under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana, people in the state can avail free Covid treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-issues-show-cause-notice-to-4-hospitals-for-violating-covid-19-orders/story-vA3FQBpv8K4MpOPySNFJDP.html
03-06-2020||City||Asymptomatic patients can be isolated in clubhouses: TMC||Asymptomatic Covid-19 patients or those with mild symptoms in Thane will no longer have to be admitted at quarantine centres. The Thane civic commissioner has asked housing societies to create isolation centres in their clubhouses and common halls for infected residents in this category.Societies will be required to register their Covid centres three days from the time they receive orders from the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC). However, civic officials claimed that the order is not mandatory.With the increasing number of Covid cases in the city, the availability of beds in quarantine centres is rapidly decreasing. Moreover, given residents’ concerns about the quality of these centres, Thane civic commissioner Vijay Singhal issued directives to all residential societies to set up quarantine units in the premises.“If a positive patient is found in any society, who has no symptoms or has minor symptoms, he can be quarantined in the society itself. The clubhouse or multipurpose hall in the society will now be turned into a Covid care centre for these patients. Societies will have to set up these centres three days from the time they receive the orders. This will also ensure that those who are critical and need hospitals, will have beds available,” said Singhal.The circular states that no outsider, including friends and relatives of the people residing in the society, will be allowed to use this centre. “Only residents will be admitted here. If the number of positive patients is more than the beds, patients will be admitted on a first-come-first-serve basis. Persons isolated at these centres can get all meals from their families, provided the members wear protective gear and maintain social distance. Food will be kept outside the centre from where the patient will have to pick it up. Disposable plates and containers will be used to provide meals,” Singhal added.Patients admitted at the centre will have to clean the area on their own, or else a sanitation worker with a proper PPE suit will be permitted. The waste generated will be given to a biomedical waste centre. Regular examination of patients will be conducted by doctors from the society but if none are available, the society should approach the corporation for a medical officer. The doctor appointed by the society will get remuneration from the concerned patient, his family, or the society.“The isolation facility will also have jumbo oxygen cylinders and oxygen masks. The concerned doctors appointed by the society will help to secure these masks or they can seek help from us,” said Singhal.While the move would ease the burden on the TMC, residential societies claimed that these directives are not feasible. K Kumar, president of Progressive Thane Resident’s Welfare Association (PTRWA), Vasant Vihar, said, “Most societies do not have such a large space to set up quarantine centres. The clubhouse is small and there is just one washroom.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/asymptomatic-patients-can-be-isolated-in-clubhouses-tmc/story-XMBWtHDf0J7WKvSoOgy85H.html

In all 10 shots were fired before the duo fled. Police suspect financial dispute behind the shooting.The incident comes just two days after four to five unidentified men drove up to the Sector 33 bungalow of hotelier and businessman Rakesh Singla on Sunday evening, firing 17 shots in what police said was a targeted attack on his younger brother, liquor baron Arvind Singla.The Tuesday attack took place outside a liquor shop owned by Ram Avtar Batra, 69, in the Sector 9 inner market near the police headquarters. The Sector-21 resident told police he has been running the shop since April 2018 and also owns a petrol pump in Sector 35.Batra said he suspects “his dispute over a money transaction with some people” led to the shooting, said Chandigarh senior superintendent of police Nilambari Jagdale.It was around 7:25pm that two men reached the spot in a white Honda Amaze car. After parking it outside a house opposite the market, the duo — one in red and the other in blue T-shirt — walked across the road and started firing at the shop. They later fled.In all 10 rounds were fired from .22 bore and .32 pistols, said police, who have recovered eight shells from the spot.One of Batra’s employees, Rajesh, sustained a bullet injury in his right arm while his son-in-law Ankur Narang received splinter injuries. Two other employees — Madan and Pawan — were also injured by shards of the shattered windowpanes.Rajesh was rushed to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research while others were taken to Government Multi Specialty Hospital. Their condition is stated to be stable. Police were in the process of registering a case at the time of filing of this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/four-injured-as-2-men-open-fire-outside-liquor-shop-in-chandigarh-s-posh-sector-9-market/story-7KlUobSJpMjUQaUFwbgAiN.html
03-06-2020||Chandigarh||Inflated property tax bills add to Chandigarh industrialists’ woes||Counting their losses in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, city’s industrialists claim they have now been hit hard by municipal corporation’s inflated property tax bills.Businesses in the city’s twin industrial areas contend that MC has issued grossly inflated property tax bills, with some even going up to Rs 12 lakh, even as most tax payers have only received SMSes about the outstanding bill amount, and no hard copy of the bills.“While we have been expecting some relief from the government for mitigating our suffering due to the two-month lockdown, here we were shocked to get inflated property tax bills. In addition to the annual payment, these bills also contain arrears for several past years. This is despite no dues pending for past years with MC,” said a tax payer, based in Industrial Area Phase 1, requesting anonymity.“I received a tax bill for Rs 90,000. On an average, my tax is only Rs 10,000. The bill also mentioned outstanding amounts for past 10 years. Thankfully, I had the payment receipts for all these years and showed it to MC officials. They mercifully corrected their records,” said an industrialist, requesting anonymity.Majority of industrial units are getting 4 to 5 times inflated property tax, which include unreasonable arrears and interests, said Naveen Manglani, president, Chambers of Chandigarh Industries, adding that worse, MC wanted tax payers to visit its office, along with records since 2004, to get the bills rectified, without looking into its own errors.“There is a 20% hike in property tax this year, which is like rubbing salt on our wounds, when we were assured by the administration that property tax will be waived for at least the lockdown period. E-sampark as well as online payments accompany collection fees, which is also unjustified. It is the MC responsibility. No such charges are levied on payment of water and electricity bills,” said Manglani.Stating that he is aware of the problem, which will be soon resolved, MC commissioner KK Yadav said, “We have received complaints regarding the inflated bills. We will be starting a helpline number on Wednesday. Those affected can contact MC on this number and rectify any mistake in the bills.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/inflated-property-tax-bills-add-to-chandigarh-industrialists-woes/story-gKrwPosUWWJn3lVYjMlUFK.html

He was rounded up by the police on Tuesday with a friend and a man from whom they reportedly borrowed the vehicle used for the shooting. Suspect’s residence raidedPolice teams tracing the vehicle to a Ropar resident were told that he had sold it to the current owner, who when questioned, said it had been borrowed by the gym owner. After receiving the information, a search was carried out in the prime suspect’s Zirakpur house, where he lives with his family, including his brother and mother while his sister is settled abroad.“We have recovered the vehicle and investigations are continuing,” said Vineet kumar, superintendent of police (operations). He did not reveal any other details.It has also been learnt that the gym owner was also involved in a case of firing in Sector 26 six months ago.Chandigarh police in its statement later on Tuesday said investigating officials were working on technical details such as call records of the suspects. Raids had also been conducted at three places in Haryana and three in Punjab, it was learnt.All names of the suspects have been withheld as they are yet to be arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gym-owner-detained-in-sector-33-firing-case-for-rivalry-with-liquor-baron/story-57mWx8N1zOTZwlwVAruZeO.html

03-06-2020||Delhi||Plea in Delhi HC against sealing of borders||A plea was filed in the Delhi High Court on Tuesday against the sealing of the borders of Delhi for a week by the Delhi government. The plea, filed by advocate Kushagra Kumar, stated that it was an “illogical, irrational, unreasonable and unconstitutional” move. The plea contended that the order of the Delhi government is in violation of the Indian Constitution. It also said that by sealing the border, the Delhi government is taking away the rights of those working in Delhi and staying in NCR cities like Noida and Gurugram to avail of the health facilities in Delhi. In addition, the citizens in other states like UP and Haryana are also denied the basic right to access the central hospital in Delhi. The matter will be now heard on June 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/plea-in-hc-against-sealing-of-borders/story-5nEiBsgLgP4gJIL4B6tFXI.html
03-06-2020||Delhi||Rising Covid deaths push Delhi’s largest cemetery at ITO to brink||The rise in coronavirus-linked deaths in the Capital, and the relatively complicated and space-consuming protocols set to bury those who have died or are suspected to have died of the pathogen, are pushing the largest Muslim cemetery in the city to the brink, according to officials who say it may run out of space if the rate of Covid-19 deaths continues to spike.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe problem, the officials said, is that these bodies take up more space than other bodies, and the land they are buried in cannot be reused, unlike when other dead bodies are buried there.In April, when hospitals across the city first started sending bodies to the cemetery in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) suits, the authorities earmarked a two-acre space within the 44-acre cemetery for those who were infected with Covid-19.“No one knew then that we would get so many bodies. We have already buried such 193 bodies since April 3,” Haji Mian Faiyazuddin, the secretary of New Cemetery for Mohammedans (Qabristan Ahle Islam), said. Though Delhi’s total Covid-19 death toll, according to the Delhi government bulletin on Tuesday, was 556, it was not clear how many of those buried in the cemetery were listed in the figures as confirmed cases.“The protocol is the same for suspected and confirmed Covid-19 deaths. They cannot be buried next to the other non-Covid bodies. Instead of the normal four-by-three, we have to dig a hole that is 12 feet deep and four feet wide. We also have to keep extra space between bodies. That means much more space than a normal burial,” Faiyazuddin said.Apart from the ITO cemetery, two other cemeteries at Shastri Park and Mangolpuri have been allowed to accept Covid-19 confirmed and suspected cases. The other grounds are smaller in size and measure less than five acres each. Faiyazuddin said the space at the ITO burial ground has anyway been filing up over the years. “This cemetery was started in 1924. In the time to come, there will be a problem for non-Covid bodies too; but burying Covid-19 bodies is the immediate problem. The rate at which we are getting the bodies, the government should provide some other space immediately. It should be earmarked far away from the main city,” he said. On Monday evening, the Delhi District Management Authority (DDMA) wrote to all district magistrates (DMs) asking them to identify space to create more cremation and burial grounds far from residential areas. The additional chief executive officer (CEO) of the DDMA, Rajesh Goyal, in a letter to the DMs, asked them to find such spaces and provide the requisite information on “topmost priority”. HT has seen a copy of the letter.The Delhi Waqf Board’s chief executive officer, SM Ali, however said there was no problem of space at the ITO graveyard, and added that there were other options.“Burial grounds across the city are managed by our committees, which are allowed to create more space in the graveyard by taking necessary steps, if required. We have enough of graveyards dedicated to bury Covid-19 related bodies in the city, so there is no need to panic.”Officials at the ITO graveyard, however, held a different view. The supervisor of the cemetery, Shamim, said that in April the cemetery got only 3-4 Covid-19 bodies every day, which was manageable. “But the numbers have increased now. On Sunday, we got eight bodies; nine bodies were brought on Saturday. Unlike the non-Covid burial space, we cannot dig the same ground and bury another body after a year, so this space cannot be used again. It is gone forever. We may have space for around 300 more bodies -- no more than that,” he said.Another official said, asking not to be named, added: “Non-Covid bodies can be buried in four-feet holes. We do it manually, but for Covid deaths, we use the [eathmover] machine. We pay Rs 3,000 for the machine per body. The bodies come wrapped in PPE kit and are lowered using ropes. We also have to keep a distance of at least four feet between two bodies. People come here from across the city. Either we bury only confirmed Covid bodies if the government says the numbers are less or the within a month, we will run out of space,” A Delhi government spokesperson did not respond to queries seeking a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rising-covid-deaths-push-delhi-s-largest-cemetery-at-ito-to-brink/story-vGeqf4Clwu5jbfgXPXlb6H.html
03-06-2020||Delhi||13 staffers in L-G’s office test positive for Covid-19||At least 13 employees in Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal’s office, Raj Niwas, have tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), an official spokesperson said on Tuesday.However, Baijal himself was not tested, because tracing teams found that the L-G had no contact with any of the infected staffers.According to a Raj Niwas spokesperson, the first case came to light after a junior assistant officer from the extended branch of the office contracted the infection from his father. After the first case was detected, all 300 employees of the office in Civil Lines were tested, and 13 results returned positive.“The first employee who tested positive was asymptomatic and so was coming to work. As a result, others who came in contact with him contracted the infection. But, the situation is under control because none of them are in a serious condition,” said the spokesperson.All 13 have been put under home quarantine as per the Centre’s guidelines, the spokesperson added. “The L-G was not tested for Covid because the surveillance teams did not find any link to him during contact tracing. Him apart, every senior and junior employee has been tested,” the spokesperson said. The official further stated that the L-G office is not being sealed and that frequent disinfection drives are being carried out. In the evening, Baijal tweeted, “Deeply concerned about health of officials of my secretariat who tested positive for COVID-19 Health of all officials is stable & is being closely monitored. All of these officials were working tirelessly in these difficult times shoulder to shoulder with other frontline workers.”“I applaud their commitment towards work & pray for their speedy recovery. All precautionary measures to contain spread of Covid-19 to continue strictly as per govt protocol,” he said in another tweet.“All protocols laid down by the ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research] and the Delhi government are being followed here,” the L-G’s office said. The infections at Baijal’s office come just a day after a NITI Aayog official who worked in the body’s Delhi office tested positive for Covid-19. The third floor of the office was sealed on Monday for sanitisation .Earlier this week, at least two officials working at the headquarters of the Union ministry of external affairs tested positive for the infectious disease as well.The L-G on Tuesday also held a Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) review meeting at his office that was attended by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, his deputy Manish Sisodia, revenue minister Kailash Gahlot, Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev and Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava, among other senior officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/13-staffers-in-l-g-s-office-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-Fd6tVPFHhW05gNyUEJlppJ.html
03-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC to monitor implementation of govt’s disposal norms for bodies||The Delhi high court on Tuesday said it will monitor the implementation of the Delhi government’s guidelines issued on May 30 for the timely disposal of bodies of Covid-19 patients, or those suspected to have died of the disease. A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan said it wants to review the government’s work on the ground.The Delhi health department’s May 30 order has made responsible the medical director/director of Covid-designated hospitals for timely disposal of bodies on time. The order mandated that such bodies must be disposed of within 24 hours and asked municipal agencies to make all arrangements necessary. The high court had, last week, taken suo moto cognisance of bodies piling up in Covid-19 mortuaries. The court had quoted an HT report dated May 28 that detailed how all 80 storage racks at the Covid-19 mortuary of the Lok Nayak Hospital were full and 28 bodies were stacked on the floor. The court also quoted the report stating that eight bodies were returned from Nigambodh Ghat on Tuesday because the facility was not in a position to accept more bodies, as only two of the three CNG furnaces were working and the bodies of those who had died five days before that were yet to be cremated. On the last day, the court had sought status reports from the Delhi government and three municipal corporations. On Tuesday, Delhi government’s standing counsel, advocate Sanjoy Ghose, said that the court particularly wanted to see whether the May 30 order has worked with regard to bodies of those who died on May 31 and June 1. Ghose also said that the court asked the government to file an updated status report two days before the next date of hearing on June 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-hc-to-monitor-implementation-of-govt-s-disposal-norms-for-bodies/story-FXRgk1VIZ26fihay2PZ5XJ.html
03-06-2020||Delhi||Debt-ridden man attempts to kill self, goes into hiding; caught||Neck-deep in debt, a 43-year-old former national-level powerlifter attempted to kill himself two weeks ago in outer Delhi’s Kanjhawala in such a way that it would appear to be accidental death and his family could receive his life insurance benefits, the police said on Tuesday. But when the suicide didn’t go through as planned, the man went into hiding to escape his moneylenders, forcing the police to investigate his disappearance as a case of kidnapping. On Monday, as the homesick man tried to return to Delhi from Haridwar, the police intercepted him on a train in Meerut.The man, Deepak Dabas, lives with his wife and two sons in Kanjhawala. “He had won a gold medal in powerlifting at the national level years ago,” PK Mishra, the deputy commissioner of police (Rohini), said.Later, he began dealing in property and opened a gymnasium. “The problem began when he borrowed money from his relatives and friends at an interest of 2% per month and lend it to others at a higher rate of interest,” the DCP said. He borrowed nearly ₹1.5 crore just to earn the interest, the DCP said, adding that he had also borrowed another ₹50 lakh to construct a house.“Soon, he was neck-deep in debt and had no way to get out of it even as the lenders began insisting that he return their money, along with the interest. Meanwhile, he could not make any money off lending,” the officer said.Finally, he decided to get out of the mess by killing himself, the DCP said. But, he added, he needed to make the suicide look like an accidental death. “He had an accidental death policy of ₹1 crore and life insurance of ₹50 lakh. He thought at least his family could benefit from his death,” the DCP said. On May 15, Dabas allegedly drove his Renault Duster car to an isolated stretch of road near the Bawana-Kanjhawala Road and doused his vehicle with diesel. “He thought if he was burnt inside the car, it would look like an accidental death. But when the car caught fire, he couldn’t bear the dense smoke and got out,” the DCP said. Leaving his burning car behind, the man walked for six days to Haridwar, allegedly to go into hiding forever. “He walked all the way since he could not find transport,” the DCP said. His family, meanwhile, registered a kidnapping case at Kanjhawala police station as they thought someone had abducted him for not returning the borrowed money. “We questioned his family and friends. We checked his and his family’s bank accounts to find that all the accounts had maintained only the minimum balance. We continued to keep a watch on their bank transactions,” the DCP said. The burnt car also aroused the police’s suspicion—why would kidnappers trouble themselves with burning the car if they just wanted Dabas?On May 19, the police found that ₹2,500 had been withdrawn from Dabas’ account from an ATM in Muzaffarnagar. “We checked the CCTV camera footage from the ATM and saw that it was Dabas who had withdrawn the money and that he was alone,” the DCP said, adding that sources were deployed to gather more information about his movements. “We alerted people in and around hotels and ashrams in Haridwar and neighbouring areas to alert us if they saw any man matching his description. On Monday, one of our informers alerted us that Dabas had boarded a Jan Shatabdi Express from Haridwar to Delhi,” the DCP said. A police team intercepted the train in Meerut and found Dabas on board. The police are still contemplating whether to press charges against Dabas and if so, under what sections of the Indian Penal Code. “As of now, the possible offence he has committed is attempting to trick insurance companies. But neither he nor his family had proceeded with claiming insurance so far. So, we are still contemplating what legal action to take against him,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/debt-ridden-man-attempts-to-kill-self-goes-into-hiding-caught/story-N9gJZ3SnGFxVVJVXTGDXSL.html

03-06-2020||Pune||Covid-19: Cases rise from 18 to 158 in Pune’s Janata Vasahat causing concern||Janata Vasahat, Pune’s largest slum at the foothills of Parvati hill, has seen an exponential rise in the number of Covid-19 positive cases in May.As per the data with Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) smart city war room, the Janata Vasahat-Dattawadi area which had about 18 Covid-19 positive cases as of May 16, reported that the count touched 158 by May 31.The maximum number of cases were reported on May 31 (53 cases) and May 28 (36 cases). The area falls under the Sinhgad road ward which had reported a total of 193 cases as of May 31, of which 158 were from Janata Vasahat and Dattawadi.The slum is located between a canal and the Parvati hills which restricts the movement of people from outside. However, intermingling within the slums has made it difficult for the authorities to keep a check on the spread of the virus.The area is spread across approximately 2.5-3 sq km and has about 7,000 to 7,500 houses with 4-5 members in each house. The civic administration which is currently dealing with the slums and congested areas in Tadiwala road and Bhawani peth is now facing new challenges with this rise in cases. Bosekar Jayant Shyamsundar, deputy commissioner, PMC Zone 3 said, “The first index cases found in these areas was that of one person who was infected possibly from the medical store at Sadashiv peth and another who was visiting a hospital for dialysis. These two were the index cases and the remaining were also close contacts.”He added, “As soon as we recorded the first case, we identified as many close contacts as possible and started testing them. Since the area was a non-containment zone, people freely moved and so there were too many contacts. We have currently sealed around 10 gallis (narrow slum lanes) from 0-56 lanes which have cases, while the remaining 7- 108 lanes do not have any cases as of yet. The public toilets in the area are thoroughly washed with sodium hypochlorite for at least 3-4 times a day. We have sealed the entry exit points of all these lanes, but we cannot stop the mingling of people within the area. The geographical area of the slum is such that we cannot completely seal if off physically.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-cases-rise-from-18-to-158-in-pune-s-janata-vasahat-causing-concern/story-O9FE2yf8fnLGuIPHha7vyJ.html
03-06-2020||Mumbai||Cyclone Nisarga to be second pre-rain cyclone to hit Maha coast in 129 years: Study||Even as the districts along the north Konkan coast prepare to handle the impact of a tropical storm brewing in the Arabian Sea, researchers from Pune’s Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology have said that Cyclone Nisarga would be the second pre-monsoon cyclone to hit the Maharashtra coast in 129 years – the first having been in May 1961.Cyclone Nisarga was officially declared as a cyclonic storm by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), after it intensified from a deep depression on Tuesday afternoon. It is currently located 450 km south-southwest of Mumbai.Click here for cyclone Nisarga live updatesThe system is expected to intensify into a cyclonic storm by Tuesday afternoon, and make landfall over Alibag in Raigad district by Wednesday afternoon, IMD said.IITM researchers analysed cyclone landfall data for Maharashtra and the west coast, since 1891 onwards, when authorities began officially recording cyclone formations. The analysis found that for June, the developing cyclone would be the first one to hit Maharashtra since 1891 and only the second pre-monsoon (April-June) cyclone in recorded history to hit the Konkan coast.“If we consider excluding Gujarat, then this will be the fourth cyclone to hit the west coast during pre-monsoon months, with previous instances recorded on May 1932, May 1941, and May 1961. We can also say that this is the first-ever June cyclone to hit the west coast, excluding Gujarat,” said IITM’s senior scientist Dr Roxy Mathew Koll, whose team carried out the analysis.Experts have said that pre-monsoon cyclones have become common phenomenon in the Arabian Sea.“As IPCC author, our report shows that future climate projections are indicating more intense cyclones growing in the Arabian Sea during the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods, which is very dangerous for coastal cities, especially Mumbai,” Dr Koll said.Experts have cited the example of very severe Cyclone Vayu, which had developed last year and ended as a low pressure system over Gujarat. “We are observing the increase in pre-monsoon cyclones in Arabian Sea. While we should not draw a trend until observing such weather systems for at least a few years, the formation of Cyclone Nisarga should not be called a rare event. However, we are assessing whether these systems are intensifying faster than before due to numerous factors including rising ocean temperatures,” said Sunitha Devi, the in-charge of cyclones at IMD.Meanwhile, there is no clarity so far if Mumbai has ever witnessed a cyclone landfall.On Tuesday, HT had reported that a tropical cyclone, which was said to have made landfall on June 6, 1882, in the city had led to more than one lakh deaths, but it was termed as an “event that never occurred” by national and international researchers in a peer-reviewed research paper.“The last major cyclone was Phyan, which also made a landfall over Alibaug in November 2009, leading to heavy rain and gusty winds over Mumbai. Other than that, there have been similar stray incidents during the 1940’s, but we are not aware of any cyclone making a landfall over Mumbai,” said Dr Koll.Another IPCC author, Anjal Prakash, said that rising ocean temperatures, increase in rainfall during storms, rising sea levels and faster intensification of cyclones in the Arabian Sea can all be attributed to climate change.“Some of the weakest cyclones at sea are being strengthened due to global warming and climate change impacts. This is no more a theory, and is being witnessed every monsoon in Arabian Sea now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cyclone-nisarga-to-be-2nd-pre-rain-cyclone-to-hit-maha-coast-in-129-years-study/story-ljNA1xkfOAlnKY14slLaJK.html
03-06-2020||Pune||Two held for murder of a man in broad daylight in Kondhwa||The Pune police arrested two persons and are on the lookout for two other accused of murdering a 46-year-old man in broad daylight in Kondhwa on Monday.The deceased has been identified as Babul Ibrahim Sayyed, a resident of Navajish Park in Kondhwa. He was the owner of a garage in Kasba peth. The two arrested have been identified as Saeeb Fareed Sayyed, 26, and Tousif Fareed Sayyed, 24, both residents of Kondhwa.The deceased man was walking down the street on Monday at 6:30pm when the four men approached him, one of them was carrying a long blade. The four assaulted him with blows and kicks before attacking him with the blade on his head and neck. In the close circuit television (CCTV) footage from the area, the man appears to have sustained a grievous head injury.According to the police, the reason behind the murder is suspected to be a dispute between the deceased and one of the four attackers since the past several years.“They had been in a fight over something related to the shop since several years. We are yet to get the details of the reason behind the murder. However, on Monday, the father of the two arrested men complained to them about the now deceased man looking at him with anger during the day. The father of the two accused was going out to get gas filled in their cylinder,” said police inspector VinayaK Gaikwad of the Kondhwa police station who is investigating the case. A complaint has been lodged by the relative of the deceased, who owns a spare parts shop in Kasba peth.“There are three cases of physical violence registered at Faraskhana police station related to these two families starting 2015. The deceased has one of those cases registered against him while one of the accused has a total of four cases registered against him,” said PI Gaikwad.A case under Sections 302 (murder), 504 (insult with an intention of provoking breach of peace), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered at the Kondhwa police station against four persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/two-held-for-murder-of-a-man-in-broad-daylight-in-kondhwa/story-fekkH2m5P8pRXfQOHzgsGI.html
03-06-2020||Delhi||Manu Sharma, who shot dead Jessica Lal in 1999, released from Delhi prison||Siddharth Vashisht aka Manu Sharma, who shot dead model Jessica Lal tending an unlicensed bar at a private party in south Delhi in 1999, was released from jail on Monday evening after the government accepted the recommendation of the Sentence Review Board.Sharma walked out of jail on Monday evening, hours after the Lt Governor Anil Baijal signed off on the recommendation of the seven-member board. Under the law, any convict who serves 14 years in prison without remission can be considered for early release if the person hasn’t committed a heinous crime when he or she was out on parole.The board had earlier rejected his release, prompting Sharma’s lawyer to approach the high court to secure his release. He told the high court in November 2019 that the board had rejected his request for early release on four occasions in an “unfair and unlawful manner.”Watch | Manu Sharma, who killed Jessica Lal in 1999, released from Delhi’s Tihar jail The court had asked the board to consider Sharma’s case for release at its next board meeting. This meeting took place on May 11.Manu Sharma was accused of violating his parole conditions when he was released for two months in 2009, ostensibly to attend to his ailing mother in Chandigarh. A huge controversy erupted when his ailing mother was seen addressing a press conference in Delhi while the son was spotted in a Delhi nightclub where he got into another brawl. This one, involved the police commissioner’s son. As per his parole conditions, he should have been in Chandigarh.Sharma eventually returned to Tihar to serve the remainder of his life term 12 days before his parole was to end.Jessica Lal murder caseManu Sharma had pulled out his gun and shot Jessica Lal after she refused to serve another drink at the Qutub Colonnade party well past midnight in April 1999. He left with his friends soon after.Sharma eventually surrendered to the police about a week later amid massive outrage against the police and his father Venod Sharma, then a Congress leader. It was alleged that his father had exerted pressure to go soft on Manu Sharma.Sharma was acquitted by the trial court in February 2006, triggering sharp protests across the country. There were suggestions that some police officers had botched up the probe.The Delhi High Court, which in an unusual move, took up appeals against the conviction on its own to respond to the nationwide outrage. In a hard-hitting verdict that didn’t spare the trial court either, the high court reversed the acquittal and pronounced Manu Sharma guilty in December 2006.Justices RS Sodhi and PK Bhasin held that the trial judge’s reasoning for acquitting Manu Sharma was “immature”, “positively perverse”, “totally wrong” and the “result of non-application of mind”. The Supreme Court upheld the order in 2010.Moved to open jail in 2018Manu Sharma was moved to an open jail in 2018 that allowed him to work with a NGO outside the jail premises in view of his good conduct. Open-jail inmates are allowed to step out of prison gates and work every day. They cannot leave the city or spend time anywhere but the place of work mentioned in the transfer order.Forgiven, says Jessica’s sisterJessica Lal’s sister Sabrina who had led fronted the legal battles for justice, told HT last month that she had forgiven Manu Sharma.“It has been 21 years [since the incident].My fight was always for justice. He has served time for what he did. Now if he is free, it does not bother me much. It is fine. There comes a time when we have to move on. I have clearly moved on. One can only hope that he(Sharma) does not ever repeat what he did 21 years ago,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-lieutenant-governor-allows-release-of-manu-sharma-convicted-for-killing-jessica-lal/story-JHu7iQyL3GD6MMGwyeBBkK.html
03-06-2020||Chandigarh||Online learning: Digital divide hurting economically disadvantaged students||With schools closed for over two months now because of the Covid19 pandemic, the only source of learning for students is through mobile, SMS, television, radio or social media. For students from families that can afford it, keeping up with studies is not much of a problem. But what happens to those who cannot afford a Wi-Fi connection at home, let alone a smartphone?Consider this, both Agamjot Bajri and Harpali Chauhan study in Class 10. Son of two marketing agents, Bahri is a student of Chitkara International School in Sector 25. Logging in to an online class comes easy to him as he has an iPhone and four computers. Chauhan, who studies in Government High School (GHS), Sector 24, can only join her e-class through her daily wager father’s mobile phone, which she also shares with four of her siblings.Sumedha Gautam, a teacher at a Sector 38 based school, says, “Now access to the internet and technology is a class-marker for lakhs of students. This means economically disadvantaged students will not get as much access to quality education as their peers will, which will push them even behind in studies.”Bahri’s mother, Deepika complains that he has been spending too much time on his mobile phone and computers during the lockdown.“Earlier it was just an hour and now it stretches to over 10 hours, starting with social media, going on to online classes, games, coaching classes, cooking classes and finally back to social media again,” she says.In comparison, Shiv Kumar, the son of a waste collector and Class 6 student at Government High School, Dadu Majra, is helping his father with the collection work and so has no time for studies. “I don’t have access to a mobile phone at all, let alone the online classes,” adds KumarMeeting overheads is not easy for families living under constrained budgets. Class 12 student Nishu’s mother is a domestic helper who recharges her mobile phone with a Rs 10 voucher for 1 GB data only when her teacher sends assignments on WhatsApp.Comparatively, the spends of a middleclass family on WiFi and mobile connections probably match what people like Nishu’s mother earn after a month’s hard labour.“I spend Rs 2,000 every month on Wi-Fi and around Rs 1,000 on mobile data so that my son can access the online classes,” says Khushpreet Singh, a software engineer, whose son, Gagan, is in Class 11.The parents of Manjot, a Class 10 student in a Sector 26 based private school, have also subscribed to an expensive e-learning app to help him stay ahead of his class in academics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/online-learning-digital-divide-hurting-economically-disadvantaged-students/story-Mdssf7S7t0azD7Ui843LVJ.html

New Jersey and Connecticut were also scheduled to hold their primaries on Tuesday but have postposed to a later date in July.Georgia and West Virginia are next, on June 7.In all, 4,750 delates — included 3,979 pledged delegates and 771 superdelegates (past and former presidents, other elected officials) — will pick the Democratic nominee at the party convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin starting August 17.Biden’s nomination is assured and despite early talk of a contested convention when Sanders had looked strong. The South Carolina primaries of February 29 changed the course of the race completely, setting Biden on the path to the nomination.Just the formal nomination now stands in the way of Biden, who is the presumptive Democratic nominee, in a direct fight President Donald Trump in the November 3 elections.The former vice-president has been beating Trump in polls, and by wide margin.

Booms were laid in the Ambarnaya River to block the fuel; the river feeds a lake from which springs another river that leads to the environmentally delicate Arctic Ocean.Putin on Wednesday ordered officials to minimize the consequences of the spill. But Alexei Knizhnikov of the World Wildlife Fund’s Russia operation said the damage to fish and other resources could exceed 1 billion rubles ($13 million).The plant is operated by a division of Norilsk Nickel, whose factories in the area have made Norilsk one of the most heavily polluted places on Earth.No cause for the accident has been determined, but a company statement said it was concerned about facilities constructed on sinking soil above permafrost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emergency-declared-in-siberia-after-20-000-tons-of-diesel-fuel-leaks-from-power-plant/story-BlNoh8vxLXD4HEPwqBT66K.html

The debate has become highly politicized, and many scientists have voiced concern.Nearly 150 doctors signed an open letter to the Lancet last week calling the article’s conclusions into question and asking to make public the peer review comments that preceded publication.“This is not some sideshow or minor issue,” said Dr. Walid Gellad, a professor at University of Pittsburgh’s medical school, who was not a signatory of the letter but has been critical of the study.“We’re in an unprecedented pandemic. We’ve organized these enormous clinical trials to figure out if something works. And this study stopped or paused a couple of those trials, and changed the narrative around a drug that no one knows if it works or not,” he said.The observational study published in the Lancet on May 22 looked at 96,000 hospitalized Covid-19 patients, some treated with the decades-old malaria drug that Trump said he took and has urged others to use.Several clinical trials were put on hold after the study was published.The study, using data provided by healthcare data analytics firm Surgisphere, was not a traditional clinical trial that would have compared hydroxychloroquine to a placebo or other medicine.The Lancet’s editors said in a note that serious scientific questions about the study were brought to their attention and an independent audit of the data has already been commissioned.Surgisphere said in a statement that the audit “will bring further transparency to our work (and) further highlight the quality of our work.”Earlier on Tuesday, the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) said it was concerned about the quality of the data behind a different study it published in May that also used data from Surgisphere and had the same lead author. Dr. Mandeep Mehra, the lead author and a professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, defended the use of the Surgisphere dataset as an intermediary step until clinical data is available.“I eagerly await word from the independent audits, the results of which will inform any further action,” Mehra said in a statement after the Lancet note. The World Health Organization (WHO) suspended hydroxychloroquine’s use in a large trial on Covid-19 patients after the Lancet study. Following the WHO trial suspension, the governments of France, Italy and Belgium halted the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 patients.Among the critics of the study to sign the letter last week were several academics from the University of Oxford and Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU) in Bangkok, which had been conducting the global “COPCOV” trial of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment of Covid-19.The trial was paused last week, after the Lancet article.In March, Trump, with little scientific evidence, said hydroxychloroquine used in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin had “a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.” He later said he took the drugs preventively after two people who worked at the White House were diagnosed with Covid-19.Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro discussed a joint research effort on using hydroxychloroquine as both a prophylaxis and treatment for the coronavirus, the White House said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-study-that-linked-hcq-to-deaths-in-covid-19-patients-comes-under-a-cloud/story-17VRlHE2g5VtBtQBkVfzpM.html

The people killed are four men, seven women and five children all aged under five,” the administrator of Djugu territory, Adel Alingi, told AFP.The toll was separately confirmed by a source in the United Nations’ peacekeeping force, MONUSCO.The attack unfolded at a village in the area of Mambisa, north of the Ituri capital Bunia, the sources said.The authorities attributed it to a notorious ethnic militia called CODECO, for the Cooperative for the Development of the Congo.The organisation is mainly drawn from the Lendu ethnic group, who are predominantly farmers and clash repeatedly with the Hema community of traders and herders.Nearly 300 civilians have been killed since the start of the year in attacks blamed on CODECO, while the UN says around 200,000 people have fled their homes.UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, in a visit to Ituri in late January, said “crimes against humanity” had been perpetrated.Tens of thousands of people were killed in Hema-Lendu fighting between 1999 and 2003.A surge in violence in 2003 triggered the European Union’s first military mission outside Europe -- Operation Artemis, under which a rapid-response force was deployed for three months to dampen the fighting. Ituri is one of several provinces gripped by militia violence in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, a country the size of continental western Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/16-dead-including-5-children-in-new-eastern-dr-congo-massacre/story-Jxd2ZkaP62a1JHiM8Na9qJ.html
03-06-2020||World||George Floyd death: US protesters flout curfew but violence subsides||US protesters ignored curfews overnight as they vented their anger over the death of an unarmed black man at the hands of police, but there was a marked drop in the violence that prompted President Donald Trump to threaten to deploy the military.George Floyd died after a white policeman pinned his neck under a knee for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis on May 25, reigniting the explosive issue of police brutality against African Americans five months before the November presidential election. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of cities coast to coast for an eighth night as National Guard troops lined the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington.There was sporadic violence in Washington and Portland, Oregon, with protesters tossing fireworks and bottles answered by police flash grenades and tear gas.Also read: Floyd protests: Indian-American hailed as hero after he opens his home for over 70 protestorsClashes between protesters and police and looting of some stores in New York gave way to relative quiet in the early hours of Wednesday. Police told media they made 200 arrests, largely for curfew violations.In Los Angeles, many demonstrators who defied the curfew were arrested but by mid-evening, calm had been restored to the extent that television stations switched from wall-to-wall coverage back to regular programming.Large marches and rallies also took place in Philadelphia, Atlanta, Denver and Seattle.The officer who knelt on Floyd, Derek Chauvin, 44, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers involved were fired but have not been charged.‘SILENCE IS VIOLENCE’Although rallies on behalf of Floyd and other victims of police brutality in recent days have been largely peaceful, after dark many have turned to vandalism, arson and looting. On Monday night, five police officers were hit by gunfire in two cities. Outside the US Capitol building on Tuesday afternoon a throng took to one knee, chanting “silence is violence” and “no justice, no peace,” as officers faced them just before the government-imposed curfew.Many of the protesters used the slogan “take a knee”, referring both to how Floyd died and a long-standing protest against racism in America that started in 2016 with a football player taking a knee instead of standing during the National Anthem.The crowd remained after dark, despite the curfew and vows by Trump to crack down on what he has called lawlessness by “hoodlums” and “thugs,” using National Guard troops or even the US military if necessary.In Atlanta, four officers and two former officers were charged with using excessive force while arresting two students. Minneapolis launched an investigation into possible discriminatory practices in the police department over the last 10 years.In New York, thousands of chanting protesters ignored the curfew to march from the Barclays Center in Flatbush toward the Brooklyn Bridge as police helicopters whirred overheard.The crowd halted at an entrance to the Manhattan Bridge roadway, chanted at riot police: “Walk with us! Walk with us.”New York state police arrested a 30-year-old woman Tuesday after she drove a car striking three police at a demonstration in Buffalo on Monday.On Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, hundreds of people filled the street, marching past famous landmarks of the film center. Others gathered outside Los Angeles Police Department headquarters downtown, in some cases hugging and shaking hands with a line of officers outside.Los Angeles was the scene of violent riots in 1992, following the acquittal of four policemen charged in the beating of black motorist Rodney King, that saw more than 60 people killed and an estimated $1 billion in damage.In Rome, Pope Francis called for national reconciliation in the United States, saying that while racism is intolerable, the street violence that has broken out is “self-destructive and self-defeating”.A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday found a majority of Americans sympathize with the protesters. The survey conducted on Monday and Tuesday found 64% of American adults were “sympathetic to people who are out protesting right now,” while 27% said they were not and 9% were unsure.In Minneapolis, Roxie Washington, mother of Floyd’s six-year-old daughter, Gianna, told a news conference he was a good man.“I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took from me....,” she said, sobbing. “Gianna does not have a father. He will never see her grow up, graduate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-death-us-protesters-flout-curfew-but-violence-subsides/story-RxnLFUQvqv3NJAjJtuE7KJ.html
03-06-2020||World||‘Nobody is safe unless everybody is safe’: Global vaccine group on Covid-19 pandemic||The head of the global vaccine alliance has warned “nobody is safe unless everybody is safe” from the new coronavirus, urging international solidarity ahead of a fundraising summit as the pandemic threatens to trigger a resurgence of preventable diseases. Scientists are racing to identify and test possible vaccines for Covid-19 as nations grapple with the economic and societal consequences of the virus lockdowns.Follow coronavirus latest updates here Seth Berkley of Gavi, the vaccine alliance, said the international community must ensure all countries will have access to any potential vaccines, regardless of their wealth. “This is a global problem that needs a global solution and we have to all work together,” he said.He spoke ahead of a virtual summit hosted by Britain on Thursday, where Gavi hopes to raise at least $7.4 billion to continue vaccination programmes against diseases like measles, polio and typhoid that have been severely disrupted by the pandemic.Also read: Covid-19 cases in India to cross 15K-a-day mark by mid-June, predicts ChinaThe meeting will also see Gavi and its partners launch a financing drive to purchase potential Covid-19 vaccines, scale up their production, and support delivery to developing nations. The fundraising goal for Covid-19 is $2 billion, although Berkley said it was an initial sum as they kickstart negotiations with manufacturers and could go up “substantially”. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The meeting comes as the pandemic exposes new ruptures in international cooperation. US President Donald Trump last week announced he would pull out of the World Health Organization and there are fears America may use its economic clout to buy up vaccines. Berkley said that countries needed a “different mindset”, adding that sharing access to drugs was not just a humanitarian and equality issue, but a global health security one. “Nobody is safe unless everybody is safe. We saw the virus move from somewhere around Wuhan to 180 countries in less than three months, including islands and isolated areas,” he said.‘Perfect storm’The World Health Organization, UN children’s agency UNICEF and Gavi warned last month that the pandemic had hindered routine immunisation services in nearly 70 countries, affecting around 80 million children under the age of one.Polio eradication drives were suspended in dozens of countries, including those still struggling with the debilitating illness, while measles vaccination campaigns were also put on hold in 27 countries, UNICEF said. Recent Gavi-supported modelling from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine estimated that for every Covid-19 death prevented by halting vaccination campaigns in Africa, up to 140 people could die from vaccine-preventable diseases. Berkley said the situation was improving, with new guidance on how to carry out immunisation campaigns safely.But he said locating all the children who missed out on vaccines before new outbreaks emerge will be a “real challenge”.Thursday’s funding drive is for a five-year period in which the organisation aims to reboot halted programmes in the countries it supports -- allowing them to access vaccines at a much reduced cost -- with the goal of reaching some 300 million children. Berkley said he was “cautiously optimistic” that the target would be reached, with more new countries pledging donations despite the economic strains of the pandemic. Recalling past episodes when vaccine work was stalled by the outbreak of diseases such as Ebola and SARS, another coronavirus, he urged nations to move beyond “boom and bust” cycles of crisis planning. “I don’t think this coronavirus is going to go away like SARS did,” he said. He also warned of an “unprecedented” level of rumour and conspiracy theory around vaccinations, particularly from the northern hemisphere. “Distrust between people in their government, the rumours and the intentional spread of false information is not only at an all time high, but it also is being amplified by social media tools that didn’t exist 20 years ago,” he said.“So we have almost a perfect storm of problems.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobody-is-safe-unless-everybody-is-safe-global-vaccine-group-on-covid-19-pandemic/story-HWmyMt8S5DzgXY4JPnPpFJ.html

There was no immediate word on any casualties.The activists said the strikes on and near Idlib province were the first to be conducted by Russian planes since a truce brought relative calm to the volatile region in early March.The truce, brokered by Turkey and Russia, halted a terrifying three-month air and ground campaign that had killed hundreds and sent 1 million people fleeing toward the Turkish border.Russia is a main backer of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces while Turkey supports the opposition. In recent years, Moscow and Ankara have become the main power-brokers in Syria, shattered by a civil war since 2011.Opposition activists said that in recent days, both Turkey and the government in Damascus have been sending reinforcements to northwestern Syria. There have also been repeated violations of the truce on the ground in recent weeks.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitoring group, said Russian warplanes targeted rebel-held areas just south of Idlib province late Tuesday and Wednesday morning. It had no immediate word on casualties in the four airstrikes.Idlib-based activist Taher al-Omar said Russian warplanes fired missiles that caused wide destruction. He also gave no word on casualties.Another Idlib-based activist, Hadi Abdullah, said Wednesday’s strikes hit a mountain region in Latakia province on the edge of Idlib, and a power station on the northern edge of Hama province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-activists-report-russian-airstrikes-on-idlib-province/story-TM21XB7dZGVHI0czpoQTlM.html

Foreign Minister Heiko Maas will talk with EU counterparts in the next two weeks about “how travel within Europe can be gradually re-established,” he said in Berlin Tuesday.Germany’s shift away from an across-the-board travel warning, put in place in March as the pandemic was sweeping across Europe, will hinge on coordination with EU member states and on whether the spread of the disease is kept in check.Maas, who said he didn’t yet have vacation plans of his own, has indicated that opening up travel in Europe will be gradual and that holidays this year would not be the same as in the past. Germany has gradually moved to lift border restrictions with neighboring countries such as France and Austria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-moves-to-reactivate-european-travel-as-coronavirus-ebbs/story-P8ZXgOc6mzNv0A9nlbviBK.html

China could enact the law later this month or at the end of August, analysts have said.About 350,000 Hong Kong citizens hold British National Overseas passports, a legacy of the colonial era, and 2.5 million others are eligible to apply for them, Johnson said in his column. Long lines have formed at DHL courier offices in the city since the announcement as people rush to apply for or renew their BNO passports.Johnson, echoing earlier statements by Cabinet ministers, said that if China imposes a national security law, Britain would allow holders of the BNO passports to remain for 12 months on a renewable basis and would grant them the right to work, placing them on a possible path to UK citizenship.“This would amount to one of the biggest changes in our visa system in British history,” Johnson wrote, adding, “I hope it will not come to this.”BNO passport holders currently can stay in the UK for only up to six months.Separately on Wednesday, Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong called on leaders in Europe to oppose the national security law, saying it erodes the “one country, two systems” framework promised to the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.Wong said that after President Donald Trump threatened to impose sanctions on Hong Kong last week, the momentum should be kept to build a “global alliance to stand with Hong Kong.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-pledges-to-let-in-hong-kong-citizens-if-needed/story-NJg6honyHl44PriN6EHpvO.html

Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost,” he said.He asked Americans to implore God for “the national reconciliation and peace for which we yearn” and asked the Madonna to “intercede for all those who work for peace and justice in your land and throughout the world”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-condemns-racism-and-acts-of-violence-in-us/story-B7sjKkEZZIZUTuDcTUoiDJ.html

Gatherings of more than 50 people continue to be banned, but throughout the crisis Swedes have been able to visit restaurants, go shopping, attend gyms and send children under 16 to school.The laxer approach to containing the virus has drawn both praise and indignation from across the globe. What is beyond debate, however, is the effect the strategy has had on the country’s death toll.At 43 deaths per 100,000, Sweden’s death rate is among the highest globally and far exceeds that of neighboring Denmark and Norway, which imposed much tougher lockdowns at the outset of the pandemic.Now, Tegnell has for the first time admitted publicly that the strategy is resulting in too many deaths.“Clearly, there is potential for improvement in what we have done in Sweden,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-behind-sweden-s-controversial-covid-19-strategy-admits-mistakes/story-DOVF7OKXg7sHbXmeM2JHwK.html

Groups of people also looted pharmacies, electronic stores and other businesses across the city.“The NYPD (New York Police Department) and the Mayor did not do their job last night. I believe that…. What happened in New York City was inexcusable,” New York State Governor Cuomo said at his daily briefing Tuesday, referring to widespread looting and violence across the city on Monday night.“Use the police, protect property, and people. Look in the videos. It was a disgrace,” he said, referring to several videos posted on social media that showed looters break into stores in Manhattan, including Macy’s flagship retail and stealing merchandise.Cuomo said that while protestors are outraged over the killing of Floyd, there is “criminal activity, looting, extremist groups, who are using this moment for their own purposes and exploiting this movement and moment. Two very different things.” “New York City was looted. It was looted yesterday. In Manhattan, middle of Manhattan, also in communities of colour, in the Bronx and in Brooklyn, where we’ve spent years doing economic development in distressed communities and these looters destroyed businesses that were essential to the community and the very people we’re trying to help,” the governor said.He said the looters are breaking store windows, going in and stealing and are demeaning Floyd’s murder by using the protests as an opportunity for criminal activity. “They have no right to wrap themselves in the flag of righteous indignation of Floyd’s murder. And that’s what they’re doing. They’re opportunists who are seizing and exploiting the moment.” Cuomo said with a 38,000 strong force, the NYPD is the largest police department in the US and those personnel should be brought in to protect the city’s property. “The police must stop the looting and the criminal activity. That is the essence of the police force. They are supported to protect the community, protect the property. They did not do that in New York City last night,” he said.Expressing disappointment and outrage at the incidents in the New York City on Monday night, Cuomo said the looters and their vandalism hurt everyone. “And the police in New York City were not effective at doing their job last night, period. They have to do a better job. But, separate the protestors from the looting.” Mayor de Blasio had on Monday extended the citywide curfew from 8 pm to 500 am for the whole week.US President Donald Trump, a Republican, tweeted that the curfew in the New York City should begin at 7pm daily and that the National Guard should be brought in to control the protests and looting. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” he tweeted.On the looting inside the Macy’s store, over 2.5 million square feet of retail space and one of the largest retail stores in the world, Trump said the largest single department store in the world and a “point of pride in NYC, was devastated yesterday when hoodlums and thieves vandalized it, breaking almost all of its large panels of storefront glass. What a shame. Bring in National Guard!” Cuomo said 13,000 National Guard are on standby and he has offered de Blasio and all other mayors of the cities in the state to deploy the special forces. The mayor has said that New York City does not need the National Guard and the police force will be sufficient to manage the situation.“The mayor said he can handle it with the NYPD. My option is to displace the mayor of New York City and bring in the National Guard as the governor in a state of emergency and basically take over the mayor’s job,” Cuomo said, adding that such an option does not make any sense since the city is already in a chaotic situation due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the protests. On Trump’s call for deploying the National Guard in the New York City, Cuomo, a Democrat, said Trump “doesn’t want to distinguish between the looters and the protestors. See the president doesn’t want to speak about the killing of Floyd, the President wants to talk about just looting because if he’s talking about looting, he doesn’t have to talk about the killing of Floyd, and he doesn’t want to talk about… reforming the justice system, he doesn’t want to talk about that so he wants to say they’re all looters. They’re not all looters. That’s his political spin on all of this.” Mayor de Blasio also stressed that “we do not need nor do we think it’s wise for the National Guard to be in New York City nor any armed forces… A National Guard – a member of the guard called up from any part of this state doesn’t have that particular training, doesn’t know our environment, but is carrying a loaded weapon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/violence-looting-in-new-york-city-inexcusable-disgrace-cuomo/story-NpUZgy1I7ckD9VLLZ9IHJO.html
03-06-2020||World||San Diego police ban controversial neck restraint which killed George Floyd||More than a week after the death of George Floyd, the San Diego police said that it will end the controversial practice of carotid restraint.San Diego mayor Kevin Faulconer and police chief David Nisleit said at a press conference on Monday that the practice will be “immediately stopped”.Nisleit also said that this is the right thing to do for the community.Also read: He will never see her grow up, graduate, says mother of George Floyd’s daughterUnder the carotid restraint, an immobilisation technique, a police officer applies pressure to sides of a detainee’s neck to render him unconscious. “But no police academy that we know of teaches a police officer to use their knee, to put it on their neck,” Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, which researches and advises on police practices, to,d news agency Associated Press.“That’s just not taught because that can impact their breathing and their carotid artery (a crucial vessel that supplies blood to the brain),” he added.Officers are also taught to get a suspect up from the ground as soon as possible, either sitting or standing, since lying on one’s stomach can cause breathing problems, especially for larger people.Also Read: Donald Trump threatens to send in army as protests against Floyd’s death simmerFloyd, 46, was arrested on Monday (May 25) in Minneapolis after an employee at a grocery store called police to accuse him of trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill. The cellphone video shows Floyd, who is black, face-down on the ground with his hands cuffed behind his back, as officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, uses the knee restraint on his neck.Floyd’s head is turned to the side and he does not appear to be resisting. As the minutes tick by and Chauvin continues to hold him down, Floyd’s complaints about not being able to breathe stop as he falls silent and motionless. Toward the end of the video, paramedics arrive, lift a limp Floyd onto a stretcher and place him in an ambulance.“He wasn’t actively resisting, and he was saying he couldn’t breathe,” said Charles P. Stephenson, a former police officer and FBI agent with expertise in use-of-force tactics. “You have to understand that possibility is there (that Floyd couldn’t breathe), and you release any kind of restriction you might have on an airway immediately.”Chauvin and the three other responding officers have been fired, and the FBI is investigating whether they willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights.Other cities like New York and Chicago have already banned the practice of restraining a person throug this controversial hold. However, Minneapolis where Floyd was killed, allows it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/san-diego-police-ban-controversial-neck-restraint-which-killed-george-floyd/story-CjHUPO6Oim2qFNYqEngRaI.html
03-06-2020||World||‘He will never see her grow up, graduate’: Mother of George Floyd’s daughter||The grieving mother of George Floyd’s daughter on Tuesday demanded justice for him, saying he was a good father who did not deserve to die face down on the pavement, pinned under the weight of a police officer.“At the end of the day, they get to go home and be with their families,” Washington said. “Gianna doesn’t have a father. He will never see her grow up, graduate. He will never walk her down the aisle,” she said with six-year-old Gianna clinging to her.Washington said she wants all four officers involved in Floyd’s death to pay for the killing.“He loved her, he loved her so much,” Washington said in her first comments since the incident on May 25. “I’m here for my baby. I’m here for George because I want justice for him, and I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.”Floyd, 46, was handcuffed and pinned to the ground in Minneapolis on Monday last week by a white police officer who kneeled on his neck as he gasped for breath.Protests and violence began across the US soon after the incident and have been continuing since then.Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of major US cities on Tuesday for an eighth consecutive night of protests over Floyd’s death, defying pleas by mayors, strict curfews and other measures meant to curtail them.Major marches took place in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Atlanta and New York City as well as in Washington, DC, near the park where demonstrators were cleared on Monday to make a path for President Donald Trump so he could walk from the White House to a historic church for a photo. Although rallies on behalf of Floyd and other victims of police brutality have been largely peaceful during the day, after dark each night crowds have turned to rioting, vandalism, arson and looting. On Monday night, five police officers were hit by gunfire in two cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/he-will-never-see-her-grow-up-graduate-mother-of-george-floyd-s-daughter/story-ij7GvXNgs50WUH88BmdnYI.html
03-06-2020||World||‘Not stopping’: Defiant New York City protesters march through curfew||An 8 p.m. curfew didn’t stop thousands of defiant demonstrators from marching through the streets of New York City throughout the night Tuesday, though some of the rampant destruction seen over the past few nights was quelled.The citywide curfew, which is in place through Sunday and was moved earlier from the previous night, was instated to prevent the widespread damage and destruction that has filled the city’s streets over the last two nights after largely peaceful dayside protests.Mayor Bill de Blasio doubled down on a citywide curfew, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard.“Everyone, time to go home so we can keep people safe,” he said on WINS-AM radio shortly after the curfew took effect.But demonstrators continued winding through the streets, mostly in Manhattan and Brooklyn, as part of ongoing nationwide protests following the May 25 death of George Floyd and other recent racially charged killings.“I’m surprised,” said Risha Munoz, on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, where at points they were greeted with cheers and horns by onlookers in building windows. “I didn’t think they were gonna let us go on, but we just kept on moving and we’re not stopping.”“Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening.Police began making arrests around 9 p.m. and shut down parts of the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, blocking it off to huge crowds of protesters. The police department announced it would not allow vehicle traffic south of 96th Street in Manhattan after curfew, though residents, essential workers, buses and truck deliveries were exempt.“We’re going to have a tough few days. We’re going to beat it back,” de Blasio, a Democrat, said.Jane Rossi said she witnessed officers rip a man out of his car and arrest him in Chelsea around 10:45 p.m.The car was behind a group of several hundred protesters that had roamed Manhattan peacefully since leaving Trump Tower at 8 p.m. Tensions had risen moments earlier when some in the group began trying to damage a bike rental station and banged on the windows of a JCPenny’s. The vast majority of the crowd moved to stop the them.Officers surrounded the car and arrested the driver moments later.“They were just driving behind the protesters making sure that we were safe,” Rossi said. “They were part of the protest.”Just after midnight Wednesday, most of the city’s streets were cleared aside from police patrolling, especially in hot-spot areas for demonstrations in areas of Brooklyn and Manhattan. There was a heavy police presence in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Crown Heights, where authorities say police fatally shot a man after responding to reports of shots fired. NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan said the officer-involved shooting was not connected to the protests.Protests continued in New York City and across the country Tuesday following the death of Floyd, a black man who died last week after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on Floyd’s neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.While de Blasio insisted the city would put a stop to the violence and vandalism that have marred largely peaceful mass demonstrations surrounding Floyd’s death, both the Republican president and the Democratic governor laid into the city’s handling of the mayhem thus far.“The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. “Look at the videos. It was a disgrace.”He said the mayor was underestimating the problem and the nation’s largest police force wasn’t deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence.Cuomo’s remarks infuriated Monahan, the New York Police Department’s highest-ranking uniformed member.. Officers are “giving their blood to keep this city safe,” he told the New York Post, adding that he’d been hit by a bike and bloodied himself while arresting suspects Monday night. Cuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi later said the governor “has respect and confidence in the NYPD” and felt the mayor should put more officers on the streets.Unprompted, Cuomo brought up the possibility of using his power as governor to replace the mayor and deploy the National Guard over de Blasio’s objections, then immediately shot down the idea as legally impractical and unnecessary.On Twitter, Trump urged a 7 p.m. curfew and National Guard deployment in his native city.“The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” he wrote.But de Blasio said the NYPD was “best equipped” to handle the lawbreaking, arguing that bringing in the National Guard risked fueling worse conflict in a city on edge.“We will regret it if we bring outside armed forces,” he said. “When you bring in people not trained for the circumstance but still with loaded weapons and put under horrible stress, really bad things happen.”The mayhem over the last four nights has challenged the 36,000-officer police force, which has a reputation as a muscular, well-resourced agency that has driven down crime and faced down terror threats in the nation’s biggest city.On Monday night and early Tuesday, police again struggled to keep up with, let alone get ahead of, roving groups of people bashing their way into shops, including Macy’s flagship Manhattan store.Nearly 700 people were arrested overnight, and several officers were injured. A sergeant was struck by a hit-and-run driver in the Bronx and was hospitalized in serious but stable condition, police said. Video also showed a group of people hitting a police officer with pieces of wreckage until he pulled his gun and they ran.De Blasio said officials expected problems farther downtown, as had happened the night before, and “adjustments were made” once officials realized that the hot spots had shifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-stopping-defiant-new-york-city-protesters-march-through-curfew/story-XYREVPRuI0MwjFhMxLxKKI.html

The 46-year-old man was handcuffed and pinned to the ground in Minneapolis on May 25 by a white police officer who kneeled on his neck as he gasped for breath.“As the night approaches I urge all citizens to obey the curfews, clear the streets & stay inside to spend time with loved ones,” Melania Trump said on Tuesday.“All cities, communities and citizens deserve to be kept safe and that can only be done if we work together towards healing and peace,” the First Lady said in a tweet.A day earlier she had said that she was saddened to see “our country and communities being damaged and vandalized.” In a tweet, Melania Trump asked everyone to protest peacefully and focus on taking care of one another and healing the great nation.In one of her tweets, she asked Americans not to turn violent during their protests.“Our country allows for peaceful protests, but there is no reason for violence. I’ve seen our citizens unify and take care of one another through Covid-19 and we can’t stop now,” she said.“My deepest condolences to the family of George Floyd. As a nation, let’s focus on peace, prayers and healing,” Melania Trump said.On Tuesday she joined President Donald Trump in visiting the Saint John Paul II National Shrine. The First Couple laid a ceremonial wreath and observe a moment of remembrance under the Statue of Saint John Paul II. The President and First Lady also visited the Luminous Mysteries Chapel, John Paul II Blood Relic, and the Madonna Icon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-lady-melania-trump-asks-people-to-stay-inside-their-homes/story-raFBaHn1u5VjRi2JJBUduM.html
03-06-2020||World||EU looks to Boris Johnson to stop No-Deal Brexit with talks at impasse||The European Union will try to convince Boris Johnson to forge a compromise later this month in an attempt to stop the UK from breaking away from the bloc without a trade deal.With the negotiations deadlocked, and the latest talks set to end Friday without a breakthrough, the EU is pinning its hopes on a dramatic intervention by the British Prime Minister when he speaks to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and EU Council President Charles Michel later this month, according to people familiar with the matter in Brussels.Johnson will be told where the EU could potentially make concessions -- as long as the UK takes a similarly conciliatory approach, the people said. That could allow the two sides to reach an accord in the second half, they said.But there is no guarantee that the Prime Minister will agree. On Tuesday, Johnson’s spokesman, James Slack, dismissed suggestions of a compromise as “wishful thinking by the EU.” The UK government has threatened to walk away from the negotiations in June if they haven’t made adequate progress.If the two sides fail to reach an agreement by year-end, Britain will default to trading with the bloc on terms set by the World Trade Organization, leaving businesses and consumers grappling with the return of tariffs and quotas.Compromise EffortsThe EU is demanding that, in return for any deal, the UK agrees to apply some of the bloc’s rules after Brexit to maintain a level competitive playing field. It also wants the European Court of Justice to continue to have jurisdiction in the UK and for European fishing vessels to maintain their access to British waters.So far, though, British officials have ruled out accepting those demands. Johnson has made it clear that he believes Britain’s vote to leave the bloc means that the country should be fully independent, one UK official said.Behind the rhetoric, though, diplomats say the two sides have started to map out where a deal could be done as they work out which positions are genuine red lines and which leave room for maneuver.European diplomats say the bloc could water down its demands on fishing and, to a more limited extent, on the level playing field.In return, they expect the UK to make a similar leap -- but so far, one hasn’t been forthcoming. While the UK has offered to stick to current EU standards to prevent unfair competition by way of a so-called non-regression clause, the EU doesn’t believe that promise goes far enough.Much of this week’s discussions will be focused on fisheries. The EU’s public position is to demand the status quo, where European fishing boats have access to British waters under a quota system based on historic catch areas. The UK wants to replace that with annual negotiations that reflect more accurately where fish are found today.‘Manifestly Unbalanced’At the end of the last round of talks, the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, called the European approach “manifestly unbalanced.” His EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, acknowledged that both sides had taken “maximalist” starting positions that they could move away from.Even if the two sides inch closer toward agreement on fishing, though, they will still have to reconcile their divisions on the role of the EU courts. One UK official warned that Britain will never agree to align with EU laws or accept the continued jurisdiction of the European courts -- and accused the EU of ignoring the political realities of Brexit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-looks-to-boris-johnson-to-stop-no-deal-brexit-with-talks-at-impasse/story-rUgDz9tpnr1UA1MJMcdnEM.html
03-06-2020||World||Perils for Pentagon as Trump threatens to militarize response to civil unrest||“Battlespace” was the word Defense Secretary Mark Esper used to describe protest sites in the United States. The top US general reinforced that image by appearing in downtown Washington in camouflage during a Monday evening crackdown. Helicopters that could easily be mistaken for active duty US military ones staged show-of-force maneuvers in Washington above people protesting the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis.As President Donald Trump increasingly turns to militaristic rhetoric at a time of national upheaval, the US military appears to be playing a supporting role - alarming current and former officials who see danger to the US armed forces, one of America’s most revered and well funded institutions.“America is not a battleground. Our fellow citizens are not the enemy,” Martin Dempsey, the retired four-star general who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote on Twitter.A current military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, voiced concern about the lasting damage that would come from using the military as a “political prop.”“Presidents come and go ... the uniform has to be maintained,” the official said.For Trump’s critics, the Republican president’s reliance on the military in domestic endeavors risks making the armed forces, which are meant to be apolitical, appear aligned with Trump’s political agenda. He has previously employed the military to help stem illegal immigration and used defense funding to build his border wall.But drawing the military into his response to the sometimes violent civil unrest that broke out in Minneapolis last week and spread to dozens of cities, is particularly problematic.At the core of the discomfort is a single idea: The military was designed to protect the United States from foreign adversaries and uphold a constitution that explicitly protects the rights of citizens to protest peacefully.Even the head of the National Guard acknowledged that responding to domestic crises makes his troops uneasy. So far, more than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up to assist local law enforcement with protests around the country.“This mission is an uncomfortable mission. They don’t like doing it, but we can do it,” said General Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau.UNWITTING SUPPORT?Esper and General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, accompanied Trump on Monday as he posed at a church near the White House while holding a Bible after law enforcement officers used teargas and rubber bullets to clear the area of peaceful protesters.Trump had just delivered a speech condemning “acts of domestic terror” and saying the United States was in the grips of professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals and others.A senior defense official suggested neither Esper nor Milley knew about the photo-op and had been at the White House to give Trump an update on response efforts.“As that meeting concluded, the president indicated an interest in viewing the troops that were outside and the secretary and the chairman went with him to do so. That’s the extent of what was taking place,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.In a memo to Defense Department employees on Tuesday, Esper called on personnel to “stay apolitical in these turbulent days.”James Miller, a former Pentagon official who sits on the Defense Science Board, said he was resigning from the board after seeing the peaceful protesters being cleared by tear gas and rubber bullets before a curfew on Monday and Esper’s accompanying Trump to the church.“You may not have been able to stop President Trump from directing this appalling use of force, but you could have chosen to oppose it,” Miller said in his letter of resignation, which he published in the Washington Post.Kori Schake, of the conservative American Enterprise Institute and an expert on US civilian-military relations, said Esper and Milley need to be held to account for their “shocking” decision to appear in that setting.“They made choices. They could have said, Mr. President, I think it would send a bad signal for me to do this,” Schake said. Alice Friend, a former Pentagon official, said Esper and Milley, by using terms like battlespace, were blurring the lines between American citizens in the United States and enemies in war zones.“To divide and conquer at home, using the United States military, is an incredible escalation of the government’s coercive power,” said Friend, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.A senior defense official, asked about such criticism, said Esper was simply using the terminology he’s accustomed to using as the leader of America’s military.But the Pentagon’s role in the civil unrest could soon dramatically deepen if Trump decides to deploy active duty forces, something the US military has been reluctant so far to do.Trump on Monday threatened to send active duty US troops to stamp out the civil unrest gripping several cities.To deploy the military on US soil for law enforcement purposes, Trump would need to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act something last done in 1992 in response to the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.To that end, the US military has pre-positioned active duty forces, largely military police and engineers, on the outskirts of the Washington, D.C.-area to potentially deploy, if needed.The top Republican on the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, Mac Thornberry, said discussions about the Insurrection Act could easily make US troops “political pawns.”His Democratic counterpart and chair of the committee, Adam Smith, said he called on Esper and Milley to testify.“I remain gravely concerned about President Trump’s seemingly autocratic rule and how it affects the judgment of our military leadership,” Smith said. “The fate of our democracy depends on how we navigate this time of crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/perils-for-pentagon-as-trump-threatens-to-militarize-response-to-civil-unrest/story-lZS80RwKnsyzn4FxvhWXkL.html

Three days later, Twitter slapped a rule-violation notice on another post by Trump warning protesters in Minnesota that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”“We are NOT attempting to address all misinformation,” the company’s @twittersafety account wrote on Tuesday. “Instead, we prioritize based on the highest potential for harm, focusing on manipulated media, civic integrity, and Covid-19. Likelihood, severity and type of potential harm — along with reach and scale — factor into this.”Still, the company has resisted other calls to drop Trump from its service entirely. “It’s important people can read and speak about what world leaders say, even if they violate our rules,” Twitter wrote on Tuesday.The San Francisco-based company said it “shouldn’t determine the truthfulness of tweets,” but tries to “provide context to help people make up their own minds in cases where the substance of a Tweet is disputed.”“Hence, our focus is on providing context, not fact-checking,” it added.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-signals-trump-tweets-will-stay-even-if-they-break-rules/story-VnxiyfVoxzd9zd2NglsfVK.html
03-06-2020||World||Facebook takes down white nationalist and fake antifa accounts||Facebook Inc said on Tuesday it has suspended accounts associated with white nationalist groups after some advocated bringing weapons to the current wave of anti-racist protests.Company officials also said they removed accounts falsely claiming allegiance to antifa in order to bring discredit to the anti-fascist movement.Antifa adherents have said they focus on defending people from attacks by authorities or vigilantes, but they have been vilified by President Donald Trump who, without citing evidence, said they were instigators of anti-police violence.Some of the removed white nationalist accounts were associated with the Proud Boys, which Facebook previously classified as a dangerous group. The others had connections to a group called the American Guard, which is now classified the same way.Multiple Facebook executives described the action on condition they not be identified. They said they acted based on behavior, not the politics of any content, and that Facebook had not designated antifa as dangerous.The company said it was looking closer at accounts discussing protests when it saw what it deemed white nationalist accounts encouraging violence.The misleading antifa accounts were removed for “inauthentic behavior,” because they purported to be something they were not, Facebook said.As with a false antifa tweet that Twitter Inc tied to a third white nationalist group and which was widely distributed as a screen shot, the Facebook executives said Tuesday the goal of such content is often not to win thousands of followers but to plant a single false flag that can be used to sow distrust about the target group.Facebook declined to comment on whether it had been in touch with law enforcement, which it typically does in cases of an imminent threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-takes-down-white-nationalist-and-fake-antifa-accounts/story-X2iZjhrySnlbaoqxKQ7kjN.html
03-06-2020||World||Not so ‘Incognito’: Google faces lawsuit for tracking ‘private’ surfing||Google was sued on Tuesday in a proposed class action accusing the internet search company of illegally invading the privacy of millions of users by pervasively tracking their internet use through browsers set in “private” mode.The lawsuit seeks at least $5 billion (4 billion pounds), accusing the Alphabet Inc unit of surreptitiously collecting information about what people view online and where they browse, despite their using what Google calls Incognito mode.According to the complaint filed in the federal court in San Jose, California, Google gathers data through Google Analytics, Google Ad Manager and other applications and website plug-ins, including smartphone apps, regardless of whether users click on Google-supported ads.This helps Google learn about users’ friends, hobbies, favorite foods, shopping habits, and even the “most intimate and potentially embarrassing things” they search for online, the complaint said.Google “cannot continue to engage in the covert and unauthorized data collection from virtually every American with a computer or phone,” the complaint said.Jose Castaneda, a Google spokesman, said the Mountain View, California-based company will defend itself vigorously against the claims.“As we clearly state each time you open a new incognito tab, websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity,” he said.While users may view private browsing as a safe haven from watchful eyes, computer security researchers have long raised concern that Google and rivals might augment user profiles by tracking people’s identities across different browsing modes, combining data from private and ordinary internet surfing.The complaint said the proposed class likely includes “millions” of Google users who since June 1, 2016 browsed the internet in “private” mode.It seeks at least $5,000 of damages per user for violations of federal wiretapping and California privacy laws.Boies Schiller & Flexner represents the plaintiffs Chasom Brown, Maria Nguyen and William Byatt.

03-06-2020||World||Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg still under fire over inflammatory Trump posts||Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg isn’t budging over his refusal to take action on inflammatory posts by President Donald Trump that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, many said, encouraged violence against protesters.His critics, however, are multiplying. Some employees have publicly quit over the issue and civil-rights leaders who met with him Monday night denounced Zuckerberg’s explanation for choosing to leave Trump’s posts alone as “incomprehensible.”A day after dozens of Facebook employees staged a virtual walkout over the issue, the Facebook chief met Tuesday with employees for a Q&A session held via online video. During that session, which had been moved forward from later in the week, Zuckerberg reportedly doubled down on his stance to leave Trump’s posts alone — although he did suggest that the company was considering changes to its existing policies around “state use of force,” which Trump’s Minneapolis post fell under.Facebook rival Twitter flagged and demoted a Trump tweet in which he referenced protests over police violence in Minneapolis using the phrase “when the looting starts the shooting starts.” But Facebook let an identical message stand on its service. Zuckerberg explained his reasoning in a Facebook post Friday, a position he has since reiterated several times.In photos: Rage and anguish from George Floyd protests spreading across US cities“I know many people are upset that we’ve left the President’s posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,” Zuckerberg wrote.The resignations, which multiple engineers tweeted and posted on LinkedIn and Facebook, also began Tuesday.“I am proud to announce that as of the end of today, I am no longer a Facebook employee,” tweeted Owen Anderson, who was an engineering manager at the company for two years. “To be clear, this was in the works for a while. But after last week, I am happy to no longer support policies and values I vehemently disagree with.”Anderson did not immediately respond to a message for comment on Tuesday. But he wasn’t alone.“Today, I submitted my resignation to Facebook,” Timothy J. Aveni, a software engineer who’d been at the company for a year, wrote on LinkedIn and on his Facebook page. “I cannot stand by Facebook’s continued refusal to act on the president’s bigoted messages aimed at radicalizing the American public. I’m scared for my country, and I’m watching my company do nothing to challenge the increasingly dangerous status quo.”Aveni did not immediately respond to a message for further comment.“We recognize the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our Black community. We encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership,” Facebook said in a statement. “As we face additional difficult decisions around content ahead, we’ll continue seeking their honest feedback.”Barry Schnitt, who served as Facebook’s director of communications and public policy from 2008 until 2012, wrote a blistering Medium post Monday. “Facebook says, and may even believe, that it is on the side of free speech,” he wrote. “In fact, it has put itself on the side of profit and cowardice.”“I do not think it is a coincidence that Facebook’s choices appease those in power who have made misinformation, blatant racism and inciting violence part of their platform,” he added, urging Facebook leaders to take responsibility and “show the world that you are not putting profit over values.”Zuckerberg and other Facebook leaders also met with civil rights leaders on Monday night. That conversation apparently didn’t go well.“We are disappointed and stunned by Mark’s incomprehensible explanations for allowing the Trump posts to remain up,” three civil-rights leaders wrote in a joint statement. “He did not demonstrate understanding of historic or modern-day voter suppression and he refuses to acknowledge how Facebook is facilitating Trump’s call for violence against protesters.”Signing that statement were Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights; Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change.“Mark is setting a very dangerous precedent for other voices who would say similar harmful things on Facebook,” the three leaders added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-s-mark-zuckerberg-still-under-fire-over-inflammatory-trump-posts/story-9J08uSbOqb1e9LXXkaoUII.html
03-06-2020||World||Canadian PM pauses when asked about US protests, avoids naming Trump||Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has refused to directly address the announcements and actions of US President Donald Trump with regard to violence following the killing of African-American George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis. Trudeau paused for as long as 21 seconds when asked for his reaction, and avoided naming Trump in his response and instead focused upon race relations in Canada.Following the lengthy silence during his daily media briefing on the Covid-19 pandemic, Trudeau said that everyone was watching with “horror and consternation at what is going on in the United States.” He went on to add that this was a time to “pull people together” and to “listen and learn”, when injustices continue despite progress over years and decades.”Trudeau was asked again about Trump, but he would not name the American President in his response. He also said there was the need to look at Canadian institutions and “ensure that those barriers that may be invisible to many of us but are far too present for black Canadians and racialized Canadians, are addressed.”This matter came up again as Trudeau addressed the House of Commons, the lower chamber of Canada’s Parliament. “I’m not here today to describe a reality I do not know or speak to a pain I have not felt. I want you to know that our government is listening,” he said.Late last year, as the October Federal elections were imminent, several photographs and videos of Trudeau emerged showing him in brown and black face. He apologised for those acts during his younger days, and again riffed on those failures, as he said, “I’m not perfect.” He added that was not a free pass not to do the “right thing.”Trudeau said, “I’m not here today to describe a reality I do not know or speak to a pain I have not felt. I want you to know that our government is listening.” However, he acknowledged the presence of systematic discrimination against minorities in Canada and need to address that challenge that not everyone saw.Canada has also witnessed protests in cities like Toronto and Montreal after the eruption in the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-trudeau-focuses-on-race-relations-in-canada-avoids-naming-trump-in-response-to-us-protests/story-E22bhetWVBm6igkRHUAdXJ.html
03-06-2020||World||Have to push for justice, examine nation’s ‘tragic failures’: George W Bush on Floyd protests||Former US president George W Bush has called upon Americans to examine the nation’s “tragic failures” and collectively push for equal justice, amid violent protests across the country over the custodial killing of an African-American man.George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American, was handcuffed and pinned to the ground in Minneapolis on May 25 by a white police officer who kneeled on his neck as he gasped for breath.His death has triggered violent protests across the US, leading to the death of at least five persons, arrest of over 4,000 people and damage to property worth billions of dollars.George Bush said he and his wife, Laura, were “disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country”.The Bushes said in a statement on Tuesday that they did not feel like it was their time to speak out, but rather it was time for them to listen. George Bush and Laura Bush said they believe that peaceful marches are good for the country.“It remains a shocking failure that many African-Americans, especially young African-American men, are harassed and threatened in their own country,” the statement read.“Laura and I are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country. Yet we have resisted the urge to speak out, because this is not the time for us to lecture. It is time for us to listen,” George Bush said. “It is time for America to examine our tragic failures – and as we do, we will also see some of our redeeming strengths. It remains a shocking failure that many African Americans, especially young African American men, are harassed and threatened in their own country. It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future,” he said. This tragedy, in a long series of similar tragedies, raises a long overdue question of “how do we end systemic racism in our society?” George Bush asked.“The only way to see ourselves in a true light is to listen to the voices of so many who are hurting and grieving. Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America — or how it becomes a better place,” he said.America’s greatest challenge has long been to unite people of very different backgrounds into a single nation of justice and opportunity. The doctrine and habits of racial superiority, which once nearly split the country, still threatens our Union, he said. The answers to American problems are found by living up to American ideals, to the fundamental truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by God with certain rights, the former president said.  “We have often underestimated how radical that quest really is, and how our cherished principles challenge systems of intended or assumed injustice. The heroes of America — from Frederick Douglass, to Harriet Tubman, to Abraham Lincoln, to Martin Luther King, Jr. — are heroes of unity,” he said. “Their calling has never been for the fainthearted. They often revealed the nation’s disturbing bigotry and exploitation — stains on our character sometimes difficult for the American majority to examine. We can only see the reality of America’s need by seeing it through the eyes of the threatened, oppressed, and disenfranchised,” George Bush said.“That is exactly where we now stand. Many doubt the justice of our country, and with good reason. Black people see the repeated violation of their rights without an urgent and adequate response from American institutions. We know that lasting justice will only come by peaceful means. Looting is not liberation, and destruction is not progress,” he said . Lasting peace in communities requires truly equal justice. The rule of law ultimately depends on the fairness and legitimacy of the legal system, and achieving justice for all is the duty of all, George Bush said.“This will require a consistent, courageous, and creative effort. We serve our neighbours best when we try to understand their experience. We love our neighbours as ourselves when we treat them as equals, in both protection and compassion,” the statement read. There is a better way.

But Trudeau, who is usually quick to answer, paused and struggled to come up with the right words when asked about Trump calling for military action against protesters and the use of tear gas for a photo opportunity.The prime minister avoided mentioning Trump directly. Also Watch | Trump threatens to use military force to crush protests sparked by Floyd’s death“We all watch in horror and consternation at what is going on the United States,” he said. “It is time to pull people together.” Police violently broke up a peaceful and legal protest by several thousand people in Lafayette Park across from the White House ahead of a speech in the Rose Garden by Trump on Monday. The protesters had gathered following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week earlier.Afterward, Trump strolled out of the White House gates and walked across the cleared Lafayette Park to make a surprise visit to St John’s Church. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, raised a Bible. He didn’t mention Floyd, the church or the peaceful protesters police had just cleared away.In the same question Trudeau was also asked what message he is sending if he he didn’t comment about Trump’s actions.“Clearly, Trudeau was not expecting this pointed question. I think he was considering whether to respond at all, which could have been taken to mean he was not going to criticize Trump,” said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto.“His comments are a criticism of Trump without naming Trump,” he said.Wiseman said Trudeau was wise not to mention Trump directly.“Trudeau is smart enough to know that. Trump has shown that he can blow a fuse even if he isn’t mentioned directly, as happened at the end of the G7,” Wiseman said.Trump vowed to make Canada pay after Trudeau said he wouldn’t be bullied in trade talks at the conclusion of the G7 meeting in Quebec in 2018. Trump called Trudeau “weak” and “dishonest.” He threatened tariffs on cars and slapped them on steel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-questions-render-trudeau-speechless-for-21-seconds/story-pf0DS8cjo2aFv2HiEkz6OO.html
03-06-2020||World||Donors rally to Biden in wake of Trump’s response to protests||Democratic donors are pouring money into Joe Biden’s campaign in the wake of the protests spurred by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week.Two fundraisers said President Donald Trump’s response to the protests and violence that has accompanied some of them have motivated donors to give even more to support Biden.“As a ‘bundler,’ you’re usually out chasing the bundle but now the bundle is chasing me,” said John Morgan, a longtime Florida-based Democratic fundraiser and one of Biden’s biggest backers. Bundlers raise contributions for candidates and parties from their professional and personal networks and “bundle” them together.Employees of Morgan’s law firm, Morgan & Morgan, gave Biden more than $435,000, his third largest source of funds for the primary. Those donations were capped at $2,800, but now Morgan, who’s preparing to raise bigger sums in the general election, can collect bigger checks through different channels.Biden has set up a fundraising vehicle that can accept much bigger amounts, split between the Democratic National Committee, his campaign and 26 state parties, the general election fundraising will far outpace the primaries. He says he’s fielded multiple calls this week from donors who can write large checks – the maximum donation is now $620,300 – asking how they can support the campaign.“It’s a whole new ballgame,” Morgan said. And it could help Biden narrow the financial advantage Trump, who faced no serious primary opposition, has built for November. Biden’s fundraising has trailed Trump, whose re-election effort raised $742 million in the last 16 months. Biden and the Democratic National Committee took in less than half of that, $342 million, through the end of April. Trump, the Republican National Committee and two fundraising vehicles had $255 million in the bank at the end of that month compared to $103 million for Biden and the DNC.Unlike Biden, Trump spent heavily on media, including pricey television ads, in May, in response to falling poll numbers. His campaign booked $17.8 million worth of ads, including $4.1 million on digital platforms, that month, according to Advertising Analytics, compared to $3 million for Biden, which was all spent on online ads. Campaigns and parties report their May fundraising numbers to the Federal Election Commission on June 20.Democratic fundraisers say their donors have been energized by Trump’s performance since the killing of Floyd, who died after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck for more than eight minutes. Violence erupted in dozens of cities, from Minneapolis to New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington.Trump’s confrontational tone – he urged governors to “dominate the streets” in a call on Monday and vowed to deploy the military to quell violence – are one factor in the surge, but even more significant is his failure to offer a unifying message to a country already reeling from the coronavirus epidemic and now facing racially charged violence, said Mitchell Berger, a longtime Democratic fundraiser from Florida.“Donors are saying he’s not doing it, he’s not capable of doing it, so our only option is to dig deeper and make sure he doesn’t win a second term,” Berger said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donors-rally-to-biden-in-wake-of-trump-s-response-to-protests/story-zalqgm4nQV33HZ053YXk8K.html
03-06-2020||World||Man gets 10-month sentence for threatening Muslim politician||A North Carolina man was sentenced Tuesday to 10 months in prison for anonymously threatening on social media to lynch a Muslim-American man who ran for a state Senate seat in Virginia, according to prosecutors.Joseph Cecil Vandevere, 53, of Black Mountain, had faced a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison after a federal jury in Asheville, North Carolina, convicted him in December of interstate communication of a threat to injure a person.US District Judge Max Cogburn Jr. also sentenced Vandevere to a year of supervised release after his prison term, said Lia Bantavani, a spokeswoman for US Attorney’s office for the Western District of North Carolina. Vandevere will report to prison at a date to be determined, according to Bantavani, who said sentencing guidelines called for a prison term of 10 to 16 months.Vandevere was charged last June in connection with a tweet directed at candidate Qasim Rashid. The March 2018 tweet included a picture of a lynching and read, “VIEW YOUR DESTINY.” Rashid posted a screenshot of the threatening tweet and reported it to the FBI.The judge also ordered Vandevere to pay $224 in restitution to Rashid.Rashid didn’t express support for a prison sentence but said he had urged the court to fine Vandevere $250,000, the statutory maximum, to “send the strongest message that there are material consequences for this kind of violent behaviour.” “Our goal from the get-go was to emphasize rehabilitation and reform,” he told The Associated Press after the hearing. “We’re a bit concerned that this (sentence) may not send that kind of deterrent message.” In a statement submitted to the court after the trial, Rashid said Vandevere’s threat evoked painful memories of a cousin who was lynched and dragged through the streets of Pakistan two decades ago, “his neck broken and his life taken because of his faith.”  “Seeing Mr. Vandevere’s threat, I felt found, thousands of miles away, by that same generational pain of violent religious persecution that my family had fled,” Rashid wrote.Authorities also accused Vandevere of posting an anti-Semitic threat on a Florida synagogue’s Facebook page.Investigators linked Vandevere to a threatening comment posted in February 2018 on the website of a synagogue in Plantation, Florida, according to an FBI agent’s affidavit. A rabbi at Ramat Shalom Synagogue contacted the FBI after somebody using the name Bob Smith posted a “disturbing” comment in response to the rabbi’s post showing support for the Parkland, Florida, high school where a gunman killed 17 people earlier that month, the agent wrote.Investigators linked Vandevere’s telephone number to the same Twitter account — with the handle “DaDUTCHMAN5″ — that posted the threat against Rashid, according to the affidavit. The post was accompanied by a black-and-white photograph of the infamous 1915 lynching of a Jewish man, Leo Frank, in Marietta, Georgia.Twitter suspended the “DaDUTCHMAN5” account.Rashid, a Democrat, lost his November 2019 bid to defeat an incumbent Republican state senator in Virginia. Prosecutors have said Rashid’s political campaign started well after the threat was made “and had no bearing on the threat.” Rashid, an attorney who works on immigrant rights cases, testified at Vandevere’s two-day trial. Rashid said in his post-trial statement to the court that Vandevere’s threat still haunts him and his family, with his wife constantly fearing for his safety.“I am forced to act now, in many ways, like someone who is hunted,” he wrote in January.In September, Cogburn rejected Vandevere’s argument that his indictment must be dismissed on First Amendment free speech grounds.Vandevere’s attorney, Andrew Banzhoff, claimed the communication in question was not a “true threat.” “In 2019, the political arena necessarily includes the public exchange of political views that occurs daily on Twitter and other social media sites,” Banzhoff wrote.But the judge said he couldn’t rule as a matter of law that the alleged threat was “political hyperbole” or that “no reasonable person would interpret this communication as a serious expression of intent to do harm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-gets-10-month-sentence-for-threatening-muslim-politician/story-pB7sDZ60o5Rp7IFeQMVp9J.html

Also Watch | ‘From my personal experience…’: UK PM Boris Johnson returns to work after covid boutHe described China’s step as being in conflict with the obligations under the Joint Declaration.“If China imposes its national security law, the British government will change our immigration rules,” Johnson said.Under the change, holders of British National Overseas passports from Hong Kong would be allowed to enter the UK for a renewable period of 12 months and given further immigration rights, he added, “including the right to work, which could place them on a route to citizenship”.About 350,000 of the territory’s people currently hold such passports and another 2.5 million would be eligible to apply for them, Johnson said.China’s parliament last week approved a decision to create laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorism and foreign interference. Mainland security and intelligence agents may be stationed in the city for the first time.On Tuesday, Britain warned Beijing to step back from the brink over the national security law in Hong Kong, saying it risked destroying one of the jewels of Asia’s economy while ruining the reputation of China.Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered his administration to begin the process of eliminating special U.S. treatment for Hong Kong to punish China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-change-immigration-rules-if-china-imposes-security-law-on-hong-kong-boris-johnson/story-neGCZizugF2K8NosMrYaZN.html

Prime Minister Modi said that India would be happy to work with the US and other countries to ensure the success of the proposed Summit, the PMO said.Expressing concern regarding the ongoing civil disturbances in the US, Modi conveyed his best wishes for an early resolution of the situation.“The two leaders also exchanged views on other topical issues, such as the COVID-19 situation in the two countries, the situation on the India-China border, and the need for reforms in the World Health Organisation,” the PMO said. During the call, Trump warmly recalled his visit to India in February this year. “Modi said that the visit had been memorable and historic on many accounts, and had also added new dynamism to the bilateral relationship,” the statement said. “The exceptional warmth and candour of the conversation reflected the special nature of the Indo-US ties, as well as the friendship and mutual esteem between both leaders,” the PMO statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-ship-first-tranche-of-100-ventilators-to-india-next-week-white-house/story-x7UNG2ecAUL9Lz2Bw5wcpI.html
03-06-2020||World||George Floyd death: Donald Trump threatens to send in army||At least six police officers were shot at during violent protests over the death of George Floyd, an African-American man in police custody, hours after US President Donald Trump threatened he would deploy the military if the ongoing unrest does not stop. Protests and clashes took place in more than 40 US cities as four American policemen were shot at in St Louis and one each in Los Angeles and Las Vegas. In another escalatory incident, an SUV hit two officers at a protest in Buffalo, New York, which slapped a curfew as looters hit luxury stores. Thousands marched in Sydney on Tuesday in solidarity with US protests as demonstrators from Australia to Europe identified with the cause of the protests and urged their own governments to address racism and police violence. Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam criticised the “double standards” of foreign governments over national security matters.Trump said on Monday that he had asked state officials to deploy military reservists of the National Guard in “sufficient numbers to dominate the streets”. If a state official refuses, he said, “I will deploy the US military and quickly solve the problem for them”.“I want the organisers of this terror to be own notice that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail,” the US president threatened, adding that he had ordered “swift and decisive action” to bring the situation under control in Washington, DC as National Guard troops moved on protesters outside the White House. Trump’s threat to deploy soldiers sparked a debate about whether he had legal authority to do so. Under the Insurrection Act, a law that is over 200 years old, the US president can deploy the military on American soil to deal with civil disorder, insurrection or rebellion.Flash-bang bombs, tear gas shells and rubber bullets were used to disperse a peaceful demonstration from a side of the White House facing Lafayette Square Park. More than 5,000 people were arrested from around the country.On Tuesday night, the BBC reported that the White House had “asked about taking over Washington, DC police”. Trump administration officials had reportedly considered the idea of taking over the capital city’s police force, according to an official in the city mayor’s office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-threatens-to-send-in-army/story-d56uYfm8IzBkBmiUGN1HTO.html
03-06-2020||World||NYC placed under curfew as looters raid luxury store||New York was under a curfew that would last until Tuesday, officials said, after looters raided stores in central Manhattan, targeting some of the city’s top retailers.Upmarket fashion store Michael Kors on Fifth Avenue was among the luxury outlets hit, along with Nike, Lego and electronics shops across Midtown, before the 11pm to 5am curfew came into effect, AFP journalists said.Groups of young people moved from block to block around the district, usually bustling with tourists but deserted due to the coronavirus pandemic, with entire streets blocked by police.Images from local NY1 television showed some young people running out of a Best Buy electronics store before being apprehended by the police. Stores in the south of Manhattan suffered a similar fate, according to an AFP photographer.The New York Times reported that the flagship Macy’s department store had also been targeted by looters.Police did not immediately confirm this, simply saying that “numerous stores were hit” and arrests made “in the hundreds” across the city.Mayor Bill de Blasio said a lot of stores around Madison Avenue had been hit and the situation was “really not acceptable.” As a result, he said the curfew would start from 8pm on Tuesday instead of 11pm. “The city is fully under control, and overwhelmingly calm and peaceful,” he nevertheless insisted on NY1.The imposition of the curfew had been announced a few hours earlier by the mayor and New York state governor Andrew Cuomo after protests and looting during the weekend - notably in the trendy SoHo district.The mayor tweeted on Monday that “protesters were overwhelmingly peaceful today” but that some people were out to damage property and steal. “We support peaceful protest in this city. But right now it’s time to go home,” de Blasio said. “Some people are out tonight not to protest but to destroy property and hurt others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nyc-placed-under-curfew-as-looters-raid/story-ppH6aYSuFsGNNYTR6ekBqJ.html

The pandemic has now killed more than 377,000 people and infected at least 6.3 million since erupting in China in late 2019. Four of the 10 countries across the globe with the greatest number of new Covid-19 cases on Monday were in Latin America, WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said. Brazil, Peru and Chile are suffering the highest daily increases but numbers are also on the rise in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia and Haiti.The region has logged one million cases and recorded more than 50,000 deaths, with Brazil having more than half of cases and close to 60% of fatalities.The mayor of Rio de Janeiro said on Monday however that the popular tourist city would start gradually easing lockdown measures from Tuesday, beginning with the reopening of places of worship and water sports. Ryan warned that the region faces a tough battle in the weeks ahead. “I don’t believe we have reached the peak in that transmission and, at this point, I cannot predict when we will,” he said.In Europe, however, from Russia to France, Italy and Britain, countries have started to emerge from lockdowns, cautiously adopting a post-pandemic version of normal. Bars began to serve again in Finland and Norway - with social distancing restrictions or shortened hours in place - while some schools in Britain and Greece opened their doors. Greece opened some hotels, schools, pools and tattoo parlours, while Italy reopened the Colosseum, although only to Italians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-torments-south-america-while-europe-limps/story-9XffZDU6mJ9cz1q8WHiuxN.html

And I won’t either. But I promise you this. I won’t traffic in fear and division. I won’t fan the flames of hate.”This was Biden’s first speech outside his home state of Delaware to a live audience since Covid-19 sent his and all other election campaigns indoors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-blasts-donald-trump-s-church-photo-op-handling-of-protests/story-sewtiOWeLZv8JBNExd8rML.html

A total of 5,000 masks for the families of the veterans were handed over to the Korean War Veterans Association (KWVA), while 20,000 masks for the under-privileged were donated to Chikitsa Trust, an NGO that works to ensure free access to quality healthcare for people in need. The donation to KWVA was meant to commemorate the dedication and sacrifice made by India’s non-combatant troop contribution to the Korean War, which broke out on June 25, 1950. South Korean ambassador Shin Bong-kil, together with defence attaché Col Lee In and representatives of KWVA, visited Chikitsa Trust’s charitable clinic in Gurugram and delivered the 20,000 masks. KWVA suggested the South Korean embassy should donate the masks to Chikitsa Trust, which has dedicated itself to providing primary healthcare to people in need just like the Indian 60 Para Field Hospital did during the Korean War, said a statement from the embassy. Ajai Malhotra, chairman of Chikitsa Trust,Trustthree Indian Army war veterans, one of whom commanded 60 Para Field Hospital, also joined the ceremony. Today’s event was part of the South Korean government’s “#StayStrongCampaign” and also commemorated the 70th anniversary of the start of the Korean War and the landing of India’s non-combatant troops in Pusan in November 1950, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/south-korean-embassy-donates-25-000-masks-to-korean-war-veterans-association-and-chikitsa-trust/story-pxDV73qETx0epamltffJQP.html
03-06-2020||India||No death in Shramik trains caused by starvation, issue being politicised: BJP||The BJP on Wednesday rejected the allegation that starvation was behind the death of passengers on ‘Shramik Special’ trains and said the manner in which the issue was being “politicised” was unprecedented. “None of the deaths in Shramik trains has been caused by hunger or starvation as per postmortem reports. Natural deaths have occurred on trains earlier too but the manner in which unfortunate deaths of shramiks (labourers) have been politicised is unprecedented without (critics) waiting to know about the exact cause of deaths,” the BJP said in a statement. Its spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain cited details of postmortem reports and comments of some of the deceased’s family members to claim that they suffered from pre-existing conditions. Dashrath Prajapati (30) suffered from chronic kidney disease, the health of Ram Ratan Ground (63) had been deteriorating, Ibrar Ahmed’s postmortem report found brain stroke as cause of death and not dehydration while Arbina Khatoon suffered from pre-existing mental ailment, Hussain said, referring to some of those who died during their journey. “We are not here to do petty politics. Government believes in tackling the problems head on, and addressing it,” he said. The BJP’s statement came after Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi hit out at the central government, saying this has been “admitted” that at least 81 deaths have happened and there are allegations that more fatalities occurred but were not being declared by the railways. The opposition party demanded resignation of Railway Minister Piyush Goyal, accusing the government of distorting facts on payments for these train services.The Congress said the central government has not spent a single penny on running special trains for migrant workers returning home as Solicitor General Tushar Mehta has made it clear before the Supreme Court that state governments receiving or sending migrants were to pay for them. Hussain reiterated that the Railways bore 85 per cent of the total cost of getting the migrants back to their home states, while the remaining 15 per cent was charged from the states. The solicitor general also said the same in the Supreme Court when asked who will pay the fare which is covered by the state, Hussain said.‘Shramik Special’ trains are being supplied with multiple meals and adequate drinking water, with over 1.5 crore meals and two crore packaged water bottles having been provided by the railways free of cost, he said. As many as 4197 of these special trains have carried 58 lakh passengers to their home states between May 1 and June 3, the BJP leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-death-in-shramik-trains-caused-by-starvation-issue-being-politicised-bjp/story-h1NZKA6ySluhBLtdoM2V9I.html

The petitioner, Namah, a Delhi resident, said the word Bharat instilled national pride while India is of Greek origin. “Now the time is ripe to recognise the country by its original and authentic name Bharat, especially when our cities have been renamed to identify with the Indian ethos.” A Chief Justice of India S A Bobde-led bench was unconvinced and read out Article 1 of the Constitution to the petitioner’s lawyer that says “India that is Bharat.”The petitioner sought an amendment to the Article and referred to the Constituent Assembly debates that made a strong pitch for the adoption of Bharat and not India. “The removal of the English name will instill a sense of pride in our own nationality, especially our future generation,” the petition said.The bench refused to interfere but send the petition as a representation to the Centre for its consideration.Minutes later, it took up another plea to replace “Bombay” in Bombay High Court with Maharashtra. The plea has been filed by V P Patil, a retired judicial officer.Patil cited Clause 4(1) of Maharashtra (Adaptation of Laws-State and Concerned Subjects) Order, 1960, which substitutes “High Court of Bombay” with “High Court of Maharashtra”. “The word ‘Maharashtra’ denotes special significance in life of Maharashtrian and that its usage must also find expression in the name of the HC as an expression of culture and right to heritage as protected under Articles 19, 21 and 29 of the Constitution,” the plea said.The court issued a notice to the Centre for its response to the second plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-sends-plea-to-rename-india-as-bharat-to-govt/story-HU5XXwV6x8NRTzC8Ppgu2M.html

03-06-2020||India||Panel set up to facilitate investment||The Union cabinet, at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Wednesday approved the setting up of an empowered group of secretaries headed by cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba that would work to make India a more investor-friendly destination.In the midst of the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, India senses an opportunity to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, especially from large companies that seek to diversify their investments into new geographies and mitigate the risks they confront. Ramping up manufacturing capacity across product lines will also help to serve large markets in the US, European Union China and elsewhere. The idea is to take advantage of the emerging opportunities from the global economic situation to position India among the largest entities in the global value chain, the government said.“We know the world situation. Industries are looking to diversify in different world locations. So, to ensure investments are enhanced in India, an empowered group of secretaries has been formed. And simultaneously project development cells will be set up in every ministry,” Information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar said at a press briefing after the cabinet meeting.The step will help make India a more investor-friendly destination and also enable the government handhold new industries, the minister said. The step will also give a fillip to domestic industry, he added.The empowered committee of secretaries will reinforce India’s ambition of becoming a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25, said an official statement.The statement said the he Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) proposes strategic implementation of an integrated approach that will eventually bring about synergies between ministries/departments and among the central and state Governments in investment and related incentive policies.Apart from Gauba, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant would be a member of the empowered group of secretaries as would be the secretaries of the departments of commerce, revenue and economic affairs. The secretary of DPIIT would be the member-convenor, and the secretary of any related department would be co-opted onto the panel, the official statement said.Apart from facilitating top investors, the empowered group will evaluate investments put forward by the departments on the basis of project creation and actual investments that flow in. Further, these departments would be set targets for completion of various stages of projects by the empowered group.Project development cells would work to create projects with all approvals, land available for allocation and with complete detailed project reports for investment.“The decision is in line with the government’s strategy of Make in India and Make for the Wold, which was articulated by the Prime Minister yesterday. This is the characteristic of major economies like the United States and China. Focused attention and inter-departmental coordination is required to implement wide-ranging reforms announced recently; hence this is a move in the right direction,” said Nilaya Varma, co-founder and CEO of consulting firm Primus Partners. It is also necessary to involve states’ officials in the group for effective implementation of the policies and the government should create a forum to resolve business disputes speedily, he said. The cabinet also approved the renaming of Kolkata Port as Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port. The Board of Trustees of Kolkata Port Trust, in its meeting held on 25 February, 2020, also passed a resolution to re-name Kolkata Port. Mookerjee, a jurist, academician, thinker and leader, is also a prominent icon of the Bharatiya Janata Party.Prime Minister Narendra Modi made this announcement earlier, Javadekar said at the briefing.Another major decision taken by the cabinet on Wednesday was to re-establish the Pharmacopoeia Commission for Indian Medicine & Homoeopathy (PCIM&H) as a subordinate office under the ministry of AYUSH by merging into it Pharmacopoeia Laboratory for Indian Medicine (PLIM) and Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia Laboratory (HPL)-- the two central laboratories established in Ghaziabad in 1975.Presently, PCIM&H is an autonomous body under the ministry of AYUSH established in 2010.

03-06-2020||India||A tweet to Sonu Sood triggers Congress-BJP slugfest in Madhya Pradesh||A Madhya Pradesh BJP MLA’s tweet seeking Bollywood actor Sonu Sood’s help in facilitating return of stranded migrant labourers in Mumbai to their native place in the Vindhya region became fodder for Congress attack on Shivraj Singh Chouhan government on Wednesday.The Congress’ attack came in the backdrop of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s claims that the state government had facilitated return of more than 5.5 lakh migrant labourers from various states and also provided food and transportation for migrant labourers passing through Madhya Pradesh.MLA Rajendra Shukla, a minister in Chouhan’s previous cabinet until December 2018, tagged a Twitter post with a list of stranded migrants to Sonu Sood on Monday with an appeal, “@SonuSood ji these residents of Rewa/Satna are stranded in Mumbai for a long time and have not been able to return. Please help them get back home.”Sonu Sood has been in the spotlight for assisting stranded migrants in Maharashtra with food and transport to get home. In his reply Sonu Sood said, “Sir, now no brother will remain stranded anywhere. Your migrant brothers will be sent back tomorrow. Please treat me with Poha whenever I come to MP.”Reacting upon the former minister’s appeal, former state Congress president Arun Yadav alleged it was BJP MLA’s expression of loss of faith in his own party’s government run by Shivraj Singh Chouhan.“Exposing the bitter truth of Madhya Pradesh is this tweet of Rajendra Shukla. Shivraj ji! Please see ex-minister and incumbent BJP MLA from Rewa doesn’t have faith in your government. Hence, he has to seek help from Sonu Sood to facilitate return of migrant labourers stranded in Mumbai,” Yadav tweeted.Congress leader in Delhi, Alka Lamba, too, joined the attack and demanded the resignation of BJP MLA.“I don’t believe (my) eyes, who is an MLA and has been a minister, it’s his government in Madhya Pradesh and the Centre, CM/PM are from his party, in Maharashtra too there are BJP MPs and MLAs but he is seeking help from Sonu Sood, he should better resign,” she said.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19As his tweet and reactions went viral on social media, Rajendra Shukla presented data to highlight the work done by the state government in ensuring migrants’ return.“My indolent friends in the Congress must note that 45 Shramik trains have brought back more than 42,000 people in the past 3 weeks. Besides, another 75,000 residents of Vindhya region have been brought back by 1,500 buses. This could be made possible with assistance and coordination between the state and the central governments.”State BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai accused the Congress of doing politics over the sensitive issue of migrants’ plight.“It’s unfortunate that even the labourers’ pain and plight is a political issue for the Congress. The entire country has seen how Congress leaders were sincere in helping migrant labourers of Uttar Pradesh. If the Congress leaders don’t have compassion for migrant labourers, they should at least not make mockery of genuine efforts made by BJP leaders for the labourers stranded in other states,” Bajpai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-tweet-to-sonu-sood-triggers-congress-bjp-slugfest-in-madhya-pradesh/story-vOKcsHmBgByndlmotuhg7N.html
03-06-2020||India||Rajasthan health secy seeks report on PPE kits after complaints of poor quality||Rajasthan health secretary Rohit Kumar Singh on Wednesday sought a report from the Rajasthan Medical Services Corporation Ltd after complaints of poor-quality PPE kits being supplied to medical staff at SMS hospital in Jaipur.“I have asked RMSCL managing director Pritam Yaswant to submit a report on the tendering and procurement of the PPE (personal protective equipment) kits,” said Singh who is also the additional chief secretary (ACS).He said there was no shortage of PPE kits and procurement was in line with the Centre’s guidelines.“I can tell you there is no shortage of good PPE kits in the state,” he said. “We are procuring kits as per the guidelines set by the government of India. RMSCL procures kits and we get some from the central government. We are supplying the ones we get from the Centre to SMS hospital.” Singh’s directive came after SMS hospital principal Dr Sudhir Bhandari wrote about complaints regarding the quality of PPE kits, which are used by medical staff while tending to Covid-19 patients.Dr Bhandari said he had forwarded the complaint letter that was received 5-6 days back to the health secretary. “I received a written complaint from 8-10 nursing staff and I forwarded it to ACS asking that the matter be looked into,” he said.Dr Bhandari’s letter (HT has a copy) says complaints have been received that the PPE kits are of poor quality, torn and made from plastic. It says medical staff complained about suffocation and discomfort after wearing the kits.He said he did not think there was an issue with the quality of the PPE kits. “After I received the complaint, I enquired from professors and doctors about the quality of PPE kits but they did not express any dissatisfaction with the kits,” he said. “There are 1,800 nursing staff in the hospital but no major complaints have been received. A few of them have complained. It’s not a serious matter.”Meanwhile, a day after SMS hospital was declared corona-free and opened to the general public, a rash of cases from the hospital staff were recorded. The hospital administration was in a flap as 23 staff from various departments tested positive. Most of those infected are from Ramganj area which was a Covid-19 hotspot but the health department has said the situation is now normalising.Those who tested positive include a doctor from the microbiology department, seven ward boys, one ward lady, five helpers in the pharmacy, one computer operator, two sanitation staff, two trolleymen, three guards and one medical machine repairman, according to the health department.Meanwhile, tourism minister Vishvendra Singh took to social media to highlight alleged negligence by the Bharatpur medical college. He said the sample reports of his security guard and RTDC staff which had been negative after testing in SMS hospital were listed as positive by the Bharatpur Medical College.In his tweet, he said after the news came out, there was a feeling of fear among people. The minister said he had got the matter investigated and it came to light that the error occurred due to wrong data entry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raj-health-secy-seeks-report-on-ppe-kits-after-complaints-of-poor-quality/story-IA2J9SEnbvmRZV0Rm0KiHO.html

The Dhikala range alone had 242 elephants.In Rajaji national park, another stronghold for the elephants in the state, 309 elephants were recorded.“The elephant census after a gap of five years will begin on June 6. According to the last elephant census, there were 1,797 wild elephants in the state. We are expecting a good surge in the elephant numbers across the state this time”, said Parag Madhukar Dhakate, chief conservator forests, (western circle) Kumaun region.“The elephant census will be conducted from June 6 to June 8 in the morning and evening hours. This census will be done on the basis of direct sighting method,” Parag said.To avoid double-counting, elephants will also be tracked for all three days, he said.“If there is a possibility of the same elephant showing up at two or more places, then it will be counted only once. The forest staff has been trained for the census and as such we are expecting an accurate census. The data generated from the census will be analysed, after which the exact number of elephants will be ascertained,” he said.Dhakate, who is also the coordinator of the forest department’s drone force, said for the first time drones will also be used in the census of the jumbos. “We have divided forests into blocks. The drone will fly over these blocks in a zigzag manner and capture the elephants,” he said.“Use of drones will expedite the census process and increase the accuracy of the counting process via direct sight method through drone cameras,” he said.Around 2,000 personnel will be deployed for the exercise. Last year in January, Uttarakhand forest department had initiated drone-based crocodile counting in the Terai area of the state, claiming it to be first such initiative in the state. Also, in September last year, for the first time the state forest department had used a drone with a flying range of up to 15 km to reroute an elephant herd that had raided a sugarcane field in Tarai area of Udham Singh Nagar.The state forest department officials said that elephant census is carried out in the state after every four years. They said it helps them to deal with the man-elephant conflict and making policy changes in conservation initiativesMan-elephant conflict is on the rise in the state. The aggression of elephants in Uttarakhand’s Corbett landscape, Rajaji National Park landscape and Tarai areas is becoming a major concern for wildlife officials.People have been killed by elephants on a regular basis while many jumbos lost their lives due to electrocution and after getting hit by trains||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-preps-for-elephant-census-will-use-drones-for-first-time/story-EmiTa1i8ccPfEizAjZtBTM.html

03-06-2020||India||Doubts cast over US firm’s study linking HCQ with higher Covid-19 deaths||A research published last month in reputed medical journal Lancet, which claimed to have analysed data of 90,000 coronavirus patients admitted in 671 hospitals across the world to conclude that the use of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was associated with increased mortality and heart disease has been questioned by a British daily. The Guardian claims to have conducted an investigation, which not only found contradictions in the study but also uncovered the alleged dubious record of the organization that carried out the study along with its owner, who co-authored it.The study which gained the world’s attention after it was published in Lancet led to several countries changing theCovid-19 treatment protocol and the world health organization (WHO) along with several other research institutions halting hydroxichloroquine trials.The Guardian investigation claims that the US-based company Surgisphere and its handful of employees had very little record in the field of scientific research and the company’s chief executive—Sapan Desai- a vascular surgeon, who had two lawsuits registered against him in the US, has been previously involved in ambitious projects that have not seen the light of the day. It further claims that the company has also not been able to explain in detail how it procured data from several jurisdictions and the research methodology employed to arrive at the conclusion.The Guardian also cites several doctors--120 to be precise- and experts who are equally suspicious of Surgisphere’s study which created a big shift in Covid-19 treatment protocols across the world and an “expression of concern” over the study published by Lancet to support its investigation. It says that Lancet has also decided to launch an independent audit of the provenance and validity of the data.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19According to The Guardian’s investigation, several of Surgisphere’s handful of employees have little or no data or scientific background. It says the company’s science editor “appears to be a science fiction author and fantasy artist” and another of its employees, listed as a marketing executive, is an “adult model” and events hostess.It also claimed that the company’s LinkedIn page has less than 100 followers and had listed just six employees last week, which was later changed to three employees as of Wednesday.Furthermore, Surgisphere has almost no online presence despite claims to run one of the largest and fastest hospital databases in the world, the publication claims. The firm’s Twitter handle has fewer than 170 followers, with no posts between October 2017 and March 2020, it says, to illustrate the point about the firm being nondescript.The investigation also refers to a 2008 crowd funding campaign launched on the website indiegogo by Sapan Desai for promoting a “next generation human augmentation device” that could unleash the full potential of any human being. The campaign flopped and the device never came into existence, says the UK daily.Also Read: India approves emergency use of remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patientsIt adds that Desai’s Wikipedia page has been deleted following questions about Surgisphere and his history.The investigation also pointed to errors in the publication first noticed by Guardian Australia, which highlighted that Surgisphere had mixed up data of Australian hospitals with two other hospitals leading to over reporting of the number of Covid-19 deaths in Australia. The newspaper adds that further investigation revealed that seven Australian hospitals, whose cooperation would have been necessary for Surgisphere’s study, had denied any association with the research or the database the firm claimed to have accessed.The study co-authored by Mandeep R Mehra, Sapan S Desai, Frank Ruschitzka and Amit N Patel was published on May 22 and it claimed that benefits of administering hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine when used alone or in combination with a macrolide, to a Covid-19 positive patient, led to increased mortality rate and heart problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doubts-cast-over-us-firm-s-study-linking-hcq-with-higher-covid-19-deaths/story-xNv51H8oOMDK3q0EwNb38I.html
03-06-2020||India||Uttarakhand increases quarantine for returnees from 75 cities to 3 weeks||The Uttarakhand government on Wednesday increased the mandatory quarantine period for people coming from 75 “high load Covid-19 cities” across the country from 14 to 21 days amid a rise in the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in the state. The government issued a fresh standard operating procedure (SOP) for people coming to the state by any mode of transport from the list of 75 cities designated as high load Covid-19 ones which include major cities like, Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Noida, Varanasi, Jaipur, Indore, Pune, Ahmedabad, Agra, Lucknow, Jaipur and Hyderabad. According to the SOP released by chief secretary Utpal Kumar Singh, the people coming from the 75 listed cities, will have to go into the institutional quarantine of seven days followed by home quarantine of 14 days. People coming from other non-high load Covid-19 cities will only have to undergo home quarantine of 14 days as it was earlier. The SOP states that those coming from any of the listed cities will have to follow the latest guideline irrespective of their mode of transport.Inbound people will have an option for institutional quarantine. They can either choose government institutional quarantine which is a non-payment based, or a payment based institutional quarantine which would likely be in a hotel for which the payment would be made by the quarantined person. Earlier on Wednesday, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said that so far about 2.50 lakh migrants have come from other states in Uttarakhand. As a precautionary measure, they are being screened on their arrival at railway stations and airports followed by quarantine. If anyone is found with symptoms of Covid-19, he/she is being immediately admitted to a hospital. Uttarakhand has reported a total 1,066 cases of the virus till Wednesday evening of which 259 have recovered. There has been no Covid-19 casualty so far in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-increases-quarantine-for-returnees-from-75-cities-to-3-weeks/story-mJ9Ii8YeAb41AmRCjCnQTL.html

The work couldn’t be taken up earlier due to the Covid-19 lockdown.”Officials said that earth laying work is already going at full pace and special passes have been issued to people engaged with the construction.Once completed, the airstrip could be used in emergency situations, the officials said adding that the area where the strip is coming up is centrally placed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-ladakh-border-tension-nhai-starts-work-on-emergency-airstrip-in-south-kashmir/story-FnHg1pLEcijPxWps6TAX9H.html
03-06-2020||India||47 new Covid-19 cases in Goa in largest spike as tally crosses 100||Goa witnessed its biggest single day surge in coronavirus cases on Wednesday after 47 people -- most of them from within the containment zone at Mangor Hill in Vasco da Gama – tested positive taking the state’s tally past the 100 mark. The fresh positive cases -- around 40 of whom were from within Mangor Hill that was declared a containment zone on Monday and where extensive testing has begun -- has sparked panic in the port town of Vasco with people resorting to panic buying after reports that the entire city would be subjected to a lockdown. Another two patients -- a mother daughter duo who entered the state from Hyderabad and two passengers who entered the state via a Vande Bharat flight from Dubai -- have also tested positive. Goa’s Covid-19 tally now stands at 126 while the number of active cases rising overnight from 22 to 57. The Health Department has collected a total of over 555 swabs across two days from within the containment zone and tests are ongoing, health authorities said. Covid-19 cases have snowballed since a couple tested positive on Monday.Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said the family’s decision to wait it out hoping the fever would subside rather than get themselves tested was part of the ‘mistake’ that led to the situation. “But it is a misdeed of one family. No sooner they developed symptoms, they should have not gone to a private doctor and instead got themselves tested at our facilities. We feel they are still hiding the truth. Definitely someone from their family came from outside or has come in contact with someone from outside. It cannot be from here,” Sawant said while denying the incidence of community transmission.The couple without a clear travel history tested positive for the novel coronavirus marking for the first time in Goa a case of local transmission in the state. The state administration quickly declared the area a containment zone while the local MLA has demanded that the entire port town which contains several vital installations like the port, the naval base, the airport, shipyard customs and coast guard offices to be sealed off. More cases are expected to emerge as testing of the 2,000 residents within the containment zone continues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/47-new-covid-19-cases-in-goa-in-largest-spike-as-tally-crosses-100/story-CDZr2M4ODNQ18HbQnt2sYI.html

The levy is restricted to non-resident companies and is expected to chiefly affect American digital services giants Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.Other countries that have already levied this tax or are considering them are Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, the European Union, Indonesia, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. Most of them are close allies of the United States.“President Trump is concerned that many of our trading partners are adopting tax schemes designed to unfairly target our companies,” said Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative and America’s top trade negotiator, in a statement announcing the investigation. “We are prepared to take all appropriate action to defend our businesses and workers against any such discrimination.”The trade investigation has been launched under Section 301 of the Trade Act, 1974, the same provision that was used by the Trump administration to slap an additional 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of imports from China in March-April 2018, triggering a trade war between the world’s two largest economies.Any potential retaliatory action against India would add to a growing list of trade differences that the two countries have struggled to reconcile despite unprecedented pressure mounted in recent years by President Donald Trump through public and private exhortation. And ended India’s special trade status last summer, and, among other things, he has taken to calling India “Tariff King”.Negotiations had reached a feverish pitch in the run up to his February visit to India, but collapsed in the final days. The two sides have since decided to work on a smaller initial deal, which, one official indicated is “expected in a few weeks”, to be followed by a larger deal at an indeterminate date.The United States has pushed India for greater access to its market in dairy and medical devices and India wants the restoration of special benefits under a US preferential trade system, which allowed India to export around $6.5 billion worth of good free of import duty. There are other issues on the table as well, such as new e-commerce rules.Trade tensions have long been seen by both sides as the chief drag on a relationship that has grown stronger in recent years, with bipartisan support on either side. The Section 301 investigation will include, typically, a public hearing based on written objections and comments, which, according to a simultaneous announcement in the Federal Register, the US government’s gazette, can be submitted till July 15.“In March 2020, India adopted a 2% DST,” said the Federal Register announcement about India. “The tax applies only to non- resident companies, and covers online sales of goods and services to, or aimed at, persons in India. The tax applies only to companies with annual revenues in excess of approximately Rs. 20 million (approximately US$ $267,000). The tax went into effect on April 1, 2020.”The Section 301 investigation is aimed at determining whether DSTs whether US companies are being discriminated against, “retroactivity; and (were) possibly unreasonable tax policy”. The Federal Register added that on tax policy, the investigation will seek to determine if, among other things, the intention it of “penalizing particular technology companies for their commercial success”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-probe-into-digital-services-taxes-may-trigger-another-trade-tussle-with-india/story-FPBDlBDUASrKsMSXFqEFHK.html
03-06-2020||India||In Rajasthan, Rs 55 lakh recovered from govt officials in bid to clean PDS list||The Rajasthan state food department has launched a campaign to cleanse the National Food Security Act (NFSA) list of beneficiaries and removed more than 100,000 cards. The department has recovered Rs 55 lakh from government servants, who lifted PDS grains despite not being eligible for it.“We have cancelled 104,343 duplicate ration cards since May 8,” said food secretary Siddharth Mahajan. The cancelled cards include 70,058 households eligible for PDS grains under the NFSA. The remaining cards were of households that are ineligible under the food security law.Mahajan said around two months ago, the food department ordered district collectors to wean NFSA lists after it found out that fake units (individuals) were added in many ration cards. “Around two months ago, we started looking at ration cards in which three or more units were added recently, after complaints that fake units (individuals) were being added,” he said.There are at least 400,000 such cards in the state. The department data showed that there are 70,000 ration cards from which 94,155 units have been removed. Units are added to ration cards by block development officers (BDOs) or executive officers of urban local bodies.The food secretary said this was part of the government’s larger plan of cleaning the NFSA list. “We have also removed thousands of government servants and recovered Rs 55 lakh from them,” he said.The district supply officers (DSOs), who are in charge of PDS in the districts, were asked to check at the backend for duplicate cards and fake units. In Rajasthan, around 70% of the population is NFSA beneficiaries and there are 26,816 fair price shops (FPSs) in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-rajasthan-rs-55-lakh-recovered-from-govt-officials-in-bid-to-clean-pds-list/story-Wfy1VltudmuZbhtgvW4mEO.html
03-06-2020||India||SC junks plea to rename India as Bharat, asks Centre to consider it as representation||There were two petitions in the Supreme Court on Wednesday regarding change in names –one that of the country and the other of a high court. Dismissing the plea to replace India with Bharat in the Constitution, the apex court chose to send the petition to the Centre for consideration. In the second matter - to rename Bombay High Court as the High Court of Maharashtra – it issued a notice to the central government seeking its response. In the two petitions, filed by separate individuals, there was one common thread: The names being sought to be changed - India and Bombay HC – were relics of the British Raj, according to the petitioners.Namah, the petitioner in the first case, asserted that the name “Bharat” instilled national pride while the “India” is of Greek origin.“Now the time is ripe to recognise the country by its original and authentic name Bharat, especially when our cities have been renamed to identify with the Indian ethos,” the Delhi resident said in his plea.However, the three-judge Supreme Court bench, headed by CJI SA Bobde, which was hearing the matter through video-conferencing, wasn’t convinced by it. Saying that Article 1 of Indian Constitution already states that “India that is Bharat”, the apex court dismissed the plea, instead choosing to send it as a representation for the concerned central ministries to consider.The second petition regarding name change was filed by VP Patil, a retired judicial officer from Maharashtra, asking for Bombay High Court to be renamed as the High Court of Maharashtra.Patil cited Clause 4(1) of Maharashtra (Adaptation of Laws-State and Concerned Subjects) Order, 1960 which substitutes “High Court of Bombay” with “High Court of Maharashtra”. According to the petition, the coinage of Bombay High Court dates back to British Raj when British Parliament passed the Indian High Courts Act in 1861 naming the three High Courts in India after the name of their respective States – Madras, Calcutta and Bombay.Patil, who filed the plea through his advocate Shivaji M Jadhav, said the concerned authorities in other states should also be directed to change the names of their high courts as per the name of the states where they are located.The apex court asked the Centre, governments of Maharashtra and Goa and Registrar General of the Bombay High Court seeking their responses on the petition.

I appeal to Central Govt to transfer ₹10,000 each as one-time assistance to migrant labourers including people in the unorganized sector. A portion of PM-CARES could be used for this,” Banerjee wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.Later in the evening, she said that “some people from outside” were trying to incite the state’s migrant workers against the state government and urged the workers “not to fall in their trap”.“We had transferred Rs 1,000 to 4.5 lakh migrant workers, spending Rs 45 crore. Our state has taken care of the entire expenditure of 235 trains to carry back migrant workers, spending another Rs 25 crore on this account. Besides, Rs 4 crore was spent as bus fare and another Rs 11 crore in intra-state transport to send them back home. In contrast, other states took train fares from migrant workers,” Banerjee said.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19During a meeting with the officials in different districts, Banerjee asked them to look for alternative employment for migrant workers who had returned to Bengal.Following her demand of direct cash transfers, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national secretary Rahul Sinha said the chief minister was trying to divert the attention from the mismanagement in bringing back migrant workers from other states.“The Centre had to push the state government to allow special Shramik trains to bring back stranded workers to West Bengal. BJP did not incite the migrant workers. They were angered by her apathy. She is trying to skip her responsibility of finding these workers alternative jobs,” Sinha said.According to the state government, more than 8.5 lakh people, mostly migrant workers, have returned to Bengal so far and another 1.5 lakh are expected to enter the state in a few days.TMC has been alleging that the crisis of the migrant workers was created by the Centre’s “unplanned lockdown announcement.” The chief minister had also alleged that the railways’ move to send trains packed with migrant workers – with the middle berths occupied – has led to a spike in Covid-19 virus among the migrant workers, ultimately resulting in the spread of the disease in rural Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-ups-ante-on-migrant-workers-issue-seeks-rs-10-000-cash-transfer-to-each/story-bWzc2wiBozTj8DgD95O1cI.html

03-06-2020||India||Ahead of Madhya Pradesh bypolls, Congress intensifies social media campaign||Win an eye on the bye-elections to 24 assembly seats, the Congress unit in Madhya Pradesh has intensified its social media campaign to make up for the lack of physical campaign in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.The Congress has stepped up its efforts amid reports that poll strategist Prashant Kishor has refused to work for the party. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is yet to announce dates of the bye-elections which are supposed to be held by September this year.On Wednesday, the party circulated a video clip on Kamal Nath with a recital of a verse in the background to highlight qualities of his leadership and underline his commitment to fulfilling his dream for development of Madhya Pradesh.Another video posted on social media shows chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan talking of the then Congress government’s earmarking a sum of Rs 6,000 crore for farm loan waiver whereas. Chouhan had earlier accused the then Congress government of not keeping its word to waive farmers’ loans.On Tuesday, political strategist Prashant Kishor told a news channel that Kamal Nath and Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had approached him to take over the campaign for the bye-elections but ‘he had not accepted the offer as he was not inclined to take Congress’ work in bits and pieces’.A state Congress leader who didn’t want to be named said, “It’s true that the party was in touch with Kishor but the party didn’t depend on him entirely to push its election campaign. We have been preparing for the bypolls for the past over two months since the 22 Congress MLAs resigned. I can’t say how the presence of Kishor would have made a difference in our election campaign.”State Congress spokesperson Abhay Dubey said, “I can’t comment on Prashant Kishor episode as I am not aware of it. But I can say that we have already launched our campaign for the by-polls and betrayal of the 22 ex-Congress MLAs to the party and to people in their constituencies is our main issue that we are raising.”The 230-member Legislative Assembly currently has 206 members out of which 107 are BJP lawmakers. The Congress has 92 members. There are four independents, one Samajwadi Party and three BSP MLAs who are supporting the BJP government. The majority mark at present is 104. BJP needs to win at least nine seats to reach the figure of 116 for a majority in the House on its own without support of any other MLA from outside.To deny the BJP the chance of continuing in power Congress will have to win at least 16 seats and then have the support of all non-BJP MLAs, a goal which will be tough for the party to achieve if there is no massive undercurrent in its favour, said another Congress leader.Dubey said he was confident that the party would win all the seats.“The biggest factor in our favour is that people have not forgiven the ex-MLAs and the fight is going to take place between these ex-MLAs if they get tickets from BJP and people themselves who are eager to teach them a lesson. That’s why we will win all the seats convincingly,” he said.The BJP has rubbished the Congress’ optimism saying it has nothing to show for development of Madhya Pradesh.“Congress lost its opportunity to do something for people as the then Congress government’s major focus during its 15-month rule was on running a transfer-posting industry. Major worry in Congress is how to face people during bypolls when its government neglected development across the state and was further busy with glamorous programmes like International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) award function that couldn’t be held,” state BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-madhya-pradesh-bypolls-congress-intensifies-social-media-campaign/story-caE6gw2BmaGyOmRfIOWTGN.html

Local villagers said that most of those who died didn’t have the strength even to walk or stand properly and suffered acute respiratory problems.“As the village is a little remote and accessibility is difficult, many of the villagers consult a local witch doctor. Though a village sub-centre was located some 4-5 km away at Padmagiri and primary health centre at Pandripani, villagers did not go there for treatment of their ailments,” said Dasharath Padiami, a member of Malkangiri zilla parishad.The village is deep inside the Malkangiri block and is not easily accessible as the 20 km stretch of the road that connects the village to the mainland is in a bad shape, local villagers said. The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Malkangiri health officials said those who died were in the age group of 25 to 65 years and all of them showed symptoms such as cold, fever, vomiting and swelling of legs before they died. The first death due to the ‘mysterious disease’ was reported on February 24, while the latest occurred on Monday, when a 35 year-old man Mona Kabasi died. There are at least 10 more, who are showing similar symptoms.A medical team from Malkangiri that visited the village suspects the deceased could be suffering from kidney or heart ailments. “Though our team is still there and still trying to find out more details, we suspect them to be suffering from chronic kidney disease, anemia and tuberculosis. We are trying to get the villagers to hospital, but they seem to repose more faith in witch doctors that worsened their problems. Most of the villagers are reluctant to come to the hospital,” said chief district medical officer of Malkangiri, Arun Kumar Padhi.“We are camping in the village and screening patients and sending them to district headquarters hospital if necessary. But the patients are returning back to their homes and consulting witch doctors,” said one of the doctors, who has been sent to the area. He refused to give his name. Malkangiri district collector Manish Agrawal said there is some pressure on the health infrastructure of the district as several doctors have been diverted towards Covid-19 duties. “I would be able to get a clear picture once the medical team return after analysing the causes of the deaths and disease,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-probes-death-of-15-tribals-in-malkangiri-due-to-mysterious-diseases/story-hB7i2bEnP3DKlhuq9jLbHI.html

Rahul Gandhi is from that area, why has he not taken action?,” she told ANI.The inhuman act has sparked an outrage as the elephant died a painful death. The incident is believed to have occurred on May 27. According to forest officials the elephant might have swallowed the fruit filled with crackers which was meant as a snare to catch wild boars.“Her jaw was broken as the blast inflicted serious injuries. It is an inhuman act. Our investigation is on and we will question people who are living in fringe areas of forests. Strict charges will be imposed on offenders,” said Chief Wildlife Warden Surendra Kumar. The incident came to light after a forest officer who witnessed jumbo’s painful death wrote a touching post.“She was in the river for long. When we saw her trunk and a portion of her head was dipped in the water. She later took a ‘jal samdhi’ in standing position. Watching her struggle was a most painful incident in my career,” wrote Mohan Krishnan, who was deputed to bring back the elephant to the river bank. The post-mortem later revealed that the cause of death was asphyxia as a result of water entering its lungs.Many wildlife activists and others took to social media to vent their anger. Actors Shraddha Kapoor and Randeep Hooda are among those who took to Twitter to speak against the cruel act. People also drew innumerable sketches and drawings to express their indignation and sorrow.An animal protection group, Humane Society International/India, on Wednesday offered a reward of Rs 50,000 for any information leading to the arrest of people involved in a gruesome incident in Malappuram.“Crop loss caused by wild animals is no justification for people taking up law into their hands to maim or kill animals in question. Incidents like this stress upon the need to improve the government systems of ex-gratia payment and crop insurance schemes that will safeguard the interest of communities while not compromising on the welfare of animals,” said Sumanth Bindumadhav, campaign manager for wildlife at HSI India while announcing a reward for those who give information about the incident(With inputs from Ramesh Babu in Thiruvananthapuram)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maneka-gandhi-questions-rahul-gandhi-s-silence-on-jumbo-s-death-in-kerala/story-Q2tKsdixePEA4N8pS9IVAK.html

03-06-2020||India||Lt Gen-level talks between India, China on June 6 a significant step: Top expert||A meeting on June 6 between Indian and Chinese military officials, led by lieutenant generals from both armies, will be a significant step towards resolving the weeks-long row along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), said National Security Advisory Board member Lt Gen (retired) SL Narasimhan.The general officer commanding of Leh-based 14 Corps, Lt Gen Harinder Singh, is expected to meet his Chinese counterpart almost a month after tensions between India and China began building up along the disputed border. The row has already taken bilateral ties to a new low.This is perhaps the first time that lieutenant generals from both sides will meet in a sensitive sector to defuse border tensions – the highest talks between India and China at the tactical level have so far usually involved major generals.Narasimhan, a top China expert, said modalities for resolving the border situation, with a focus on concerns brought to the table by both sides, could figure in the agenda for the upcoming meeting.Defence minister Rajnath Singh had on Tuesday announced that a meeting between senior Indian and Chinese military officers will be held on June 6 to discuss the border situation.The Northern Army commander, Lt Gen YK Joshi, was in Leh on Wednesday for a security review of the sensitive sector, where Indian and Chinese soldiers are eyeball-to-eyeball at four locations along the LAC.Several rounds of talks between local military commanders, including three rounds of discussions between major generals, have failed to break the impasse that began with a violent confrontation between rival patrols near Pangong lake four weeks ago.Around 250 soldiers from the two sides clashed near Pangong lake on the night of May 5-6, and the scuffle left scores of troops injured. While an immediate flare-up was avoided as both armies stuck to protocols to resolve the immediate situation, tensions swiftly spread to other pockets along the LAC.China has marshalled close to 5,000 soldiers and deployed tanks and artillery on its side of the disputed border in Ladakh sector, where India has also sent military reinforcements and matched the neighbour’s military moves, as reported by Hindustan Times on May 26.Chinese state-run media has described the latest tensions as the worst since the 2017 Doklam standoff that lasted 73 days.HT was the first to report on May 10 about tensions flaring up between India and China in north Sikkim, where 150 soldiers were involved in a tense standoff a day earlier. Four Indian and seven Chinese soldiers were injured at Naku La during the confrontation.The external affairs ministry has said that Chinese troops have hindered patrols by Indian forces on the Indian side of the LAC and that contacts have been established through military and diplomatic channels to address the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lt-gen-level-talks-between-india-china-significant-top-expert/story-0wRotij9xR4ZBJEBiT8BXK.html

No action has ever been taken against a single poacher or wildlife killer so they keep doing it. I can only suggest that you call/email and ask for action,” she tweeted.She also attached a document along with her tweet claiming that “About 600 elephants are killed by the temples by breaking their legs, beating and starving them and otherwise by private owners by insuring them and then deliberately drowning them or giving them gangrene by putting rusted nails on them. I talk to the department almost every week about an elephant and they do absolutely nothing.”Maneka Gandhi further posted telephone numbers of the state forest minister as well as other officials urging people to reach out to them.The elephant had died on May 27 after she ate the pineapple stuffed with crackers and forest officials said that it died standing in river Velliyar after it suffered an injury in its lower jaw. The elephant was seen standing in the river with her mouth and trunk in the water, for some relief from the pain after the fruit exploded in her mouth.Meanwhile on Wednesday, Mannarkkad forest range officer said that an FIR has been lodged against unidentified people under relevant sections of Wild Life Protection Act over incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maneka-gandhi-tears-into-state-govt-over-elephant-s-death-in-kerala-s-mallapuram/story-RDq2Ot4N0pKYmaXyo6yuUN.html
03-06-2020||India||Lawyers’ associations demand reopening of courts||Several lawyers’ bodies have started pressuring the chief justices of high courts (HCs) and the Supreme Court (SC) to revert to normal physical court hearings citing an acute financial crunch and other difficulties being faced by lawyers due to the restricted functioning of courts because of the nationwide lockdown that was imposed by the central government from March 25 to contain the spread of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.The Bar Council of India (BCI), the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA) and the Gujarat High Court Advocates Association (GHCAA) have urged chief justices of HCs and the SC to resume physical hearings.Courts have been hearing only urgent matters through the video-conferencing facility, which have led to a growing pendency of cases in an overburdened higher judiciary. Lockdown restrictions have hit the legal profession hard and many lawyers are struggling to make both ends meet.Senior advocate Yatin Oza highlighted an incident from Gujarat to bolster his argument about the financial struggles being faced by lawyers due to the prevailing lockdown restrictions. Oza, who quit as the president of the Gujarat High Court Advocates’ Association (GHCAA) on Tuesday following differences within the managing committee of the association, ciated in his resignation letter that when he recently placed an order for food from Swiggy, an online food ordering and delivering platform, the delivery person turned out to be a lawyer, who used to practice in the Gujarat HC.“Over 700 junior lawyers have expressed their financial woes to me,” Oza said.The GHCAA had conducted a referendum to arrive at a consensus on whether they should petition the chief justice for resuming physical hearings.In the referendum, over 64 percent of the respondents had voted in favour of the resumption of physical hearings. The GHCCA’s vice-president and joint secretary were at odds with the members of the managing committee and requested the chief justice to persist with the ongoing video-conferencing facility.This led to Oza’s resignation on Tuesday even though he withdrew it later in the day after the Bar members pressured him to stay on.Oza told HT that he is in favour of the resumption of physical court hearings.“If judges want to continue with the virtual court, they should sit five days in a week with all the judges attending as per the roster. The judges should adhere to the normal court timings. There cannot be five judges, who’re hearing only four categories of cases,” Oza said.There has been a drastic reduction in the cases heard by courts, including the SC, since the video-conferencing facility was introduced in end-March because of the nationwide lockdown restrictions.For instance, the apex court heard only 835 cases between March 23 and May 1. While on a normal working day, the SC hears around 800 cases. The HCs, too, are grappling with a growing pendency of cases.“The pendency of cases is running into lakhs. People are waiting for justice for at least a decade. The Gujarat HC hears only five types of cases through the video-conferencing facility. Many advocates are waiting for weeks to get their cases listed,” Oza said.The BCI had also appealed to courts to revert to physical court hearings citing the difficulties being faced by a majority of lawyers, who do not have access to technology. On May 26, the BCI chairperson wrote a letter to the Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde and alleged that only a handful of privileged advocates have been able to utilise the benefit of hearings conducted via the video-conference facility. On Tuesday, the SCAORA wrote a similar letter to the CJI.Shivaji M Jadhav, president, SCAORA, wrote in the letter that around 95% of the lawyers are not comfortable with virtual court hearings since they are a major deterrent to argue cases effectively before a bench.The SCAORA, which is the body of lawyers eligible to file cases in the SC, urged the CJI to commence physical court hearings from July. Jadhav exuded confidence about the SC acceding to their plea.“It’s uncertain at this point in time when the pandemic will end and we’ve no option but to live with the viral outbreak. The SC should resume physical hearings from July because many lawyers are suffering. I know that it’s a risky proposition but the apex court still has one month to ensure that adequate arrangements are made and precautions are taken before it reopens,” Jadhav told HT.Advocate Mukund P Unny, a young lawyer practicing in Delhi courts, had a counter-point to resume physical court hearings.“It’s true that the livelihood of many lawyers has been affected. However, the resumption of physical hearings may aggravate the problem. For instance, a judge at a Rohini court, tested Covid-19 positive on Wednesday. Courts can become hotspots. Perhaps, the video-conferencing facility can be ramped up and all the cases can be heard and not just urgent matters,” said Unny.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lawyers-associations-demand-reopening-of-courts/story-G95N05V87N72Db2P7XlPLP.html

03-06-2020||India||Bengal govt to review proposal for women on night shift in jute mills||Mamata Banerjee’s government will review an appeal by Bengal’s jute mill owners to allow women to work on night shifts and let mills employ temporary workers without provident fund for six months, the state’s labour minister Moloy Ghatak said Wednesday.The appeal came as the jute industry ran into manpower shortage following the exodus of workers from states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh during the lockdown.If the government allows it, it will mean that women will be working at night in Bengal’s jute mills for the first time. Bengal is the highest producer of jute in the country. In neighbouring Bangladesh, women constitute around 18 per cent of the workforce in jute mills. On May 29, chief minister Mamata Banerjee allowed the 59 operational jute mills in Bengal to start production with 100 per cent manpower from June 1. A day later, Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA), the apex business chamber for India’s jute industry, requested labour minister Moloy Ghatak to let women work at night and allow employment of temporary workers without provident fund for six months.“A lot of people from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh etc have returned home, leading to staff shortage. On the other hand, a large number of migrant workers from Bengal have come back. They need jobs. If the government agrees to our proposals this crisis can be turned into a win-win situation for many unemployed people,” R K Poddar, a senior member of IJMA, told HT.“We will review the appeals and a committee will look into this. Earlier, we allowed two industries, including a soft drink giant, to let women work at night,” labour minister Moloy Ghatak told HT. “As far as letting temporary workers work without provident fund is concerned, the industry has said their money will be transferred to bank accounts. We will review this,” the minister added.On May 29, Bhaskar Khulbe, an advisor to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, wrote to Bengal’s chief secretary Rajiva Sinha. “I would request you to kindly consider assisting the jute mills in reaching the assured production of 10,000 bales per day as early as possible and definitely by June 15. We shall appreciate your feedback by June 4 to enable us to further review the matter on June 8,” said the letter from PMO.Since April, the Centre has been urging the Bengal government to direct jute mills to resume operation in view of shortage of jute bags in food grain producing states. In one of the letters, the Centre said, “…packaging material like jute bales are immensely required by major procuring states like Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madya Pradesh.”On April 5, Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao requested the Prime Minister to open jute bag manufacturing units in Bengal and ensure transportation of jute bags through special goods trains to his state.Till May 29, however, Bengal allowed deployment of only 50 per cent manpower in most of the mills. The jute industry suffered a nationwide loss of Rs 1,250 crore during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-govt-reviews-proposal-for-women-on-night-shift-in-jute-mills/story-omJjIURUR80P0meFkOVJQO.html
03-06-2020||India||Uttarakhand govt gears up for Char Dham Yatra; priest body apprehensive||Devbhoomi Tirtha Purohit Haqhakudhari Mahapanchayat, a priests’ body in Uttarakhand that has representatives from all the major shrines in the hill state, has opposed the state government’s proposed move to start the annual Char Dham yatra from June 8 in line with the Union Ministry of Home Affairs’(MHA) guidelines on opening religious places of worship amid the easing of lockdown restrictions that were imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. Brijesh Sati, the spokesperson of the mahapanchayat, said the priests of the four main shrines of Uttarakhand are against starting the Char Dham yatra from Monday, as they have expressed their reservations about maintaining strict social distancing norms and sanitisation of vehicles as a precautionary measure to prevent the pandemic. “The opening of the Char Dham yatra is fraught with the risk of the spread of the infection, as it may not be feasible to maintain strict social distancing norms and sanitisation of vehicles. Besides, our hill state has been reporting a growing number of Covid-19 positive cases daily,” Sati said.On Tuesday, representatives of the priests from the Kedarnath shrine met the district magistrate of Rudraprayag to discuss the matter. The priests from Gangotri and Yamunotri Dham Temple Committees have also raised similar objections. The priests want the decision to open the shrines for pilgrims to be postponed for a few more weeks because of the spiralling number of Covid-19 positive cases in the hill state.Rajesh Semwal, co-secretary, Gangotri Dham Temple Committee, said Covid-19 positive cases are comparatively lesser in the hilly districts and most of them have been reported among the migrants who have returned to their home state amid the easing of lockdown restrictions.“Those who tested Covid-19 positive have had a travel history from other states. If Char Dham yatra begins and pilgrims start coming from outside, then the infection is likely to spread. Under such circumstances, it’s prudent not to start the yatra from Monday,” said Semwal.State cabinet minister Madan Kaushik, who is also the official spokesperson of the state government, said that the priests’ apprehensions would be taken into consideration before taking a final call on starting the Char Dham yatra from Monday.“We’re closely studying the MHA guidelines. If the yatra starts from Monday, then it’ll be restricted to only pilgrims from Uttarakhand, as the interstate travel restrictions are still in place and state borders are closed. Besides, there are issues about acquiring passes while coming from the red zones. All these issues will be discussed threadbare before a final decision is taken on starting the Char Dham yatra from Monday,” Kaushik said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-govt-gears-up-for-char-dham-yatra-priest-body-apprehensive/story-inHl64WW2SqC9tR3iQXZhI.html

It is a very beneficial programme for those who are dependent on the ration provided by the government,” said Rawat at a digital interaction where he spoke about the achievements of NDA-2 under Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the first year of its second term.Rawat is now in home quarantine after tourism minister Satpal Maharaj tested positive for Covid-19 a few days ago. During the video chat of about 45 minutes, he spoke on various issues including the measures taken by the state to fight the pandemic along with the achievements of the Centre.He said the government will gradually start the Char Dham Yatra but it would be a limited, controlled and a safe one.“After the Centre had allowed the states to open religious places, the Uttarakhand government will soon start the much revered Char Dham Yatra. However, we are looking at a limited, controlled and safe Char Dham Yatra this time considering the pandemic.”“So far a date has not been fixed because for the same, as we have to first check many aspects including whether the locals are mentally prepared to welcome the yatris or not and whether there are enough facilities with required precautions for the pandemic. Our authorities concerned will evaluate all these factors before we could give a go-ahead to the yatra,” said Rawat. Rawat also said that the government was taking necessary steps to quarantine incoming migrants after the Covid-19 tally in the state went past 1,000 on Tuesday.“We are collecting complete data on the number of migrants who have returned, for which the process will be completed soon. The government is taking all necessary steps to screen them and quarantine them as per guidelines,” said Rawat. On the revival of the state’s economy he said that many of the industries have already resumed their operations after the government started the online permission process for them on the same. He said, “We have already started the registry process of properties for which revenue is being generated. We have also started the Mukhyamantri Swarojgar Yojana under which we have stated about 125 livelihood options for which our residents especially in the hilly areas could get a subsidy in loans. Apart from this, the Mukhyamantri Krishi Vikas Yojana has also been implemented for the development of agriculture in the state.”Rawat said the Centre’s recent package will revive the economy.“To counter the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic, PM Modi recently announced an economic package which would be very helpful for the service sector and MSME sector. With all these measures the economy would surely get a boost and big developments under the leadership of PM Modi,” said Rawat||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-to-implement-one-nation-one-ration-card-scheme-from-august-cm/story-gcooKw9LZ7xm4wUQlMABQN.html

The apex council, comprising Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and chief ministers of both states, will meet at a later date.The meeting of KRMB, being held on the directions of Shekhawat, will be attended by the principal secretaries and engineers-in-chief of irrigation of both states.The latest water dispute between the two states erupted last month, when the Andhra Pradesh government headed by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy issued an order proposing the construction of a lift irrigation scheme on Krishna river on the foreshore of Srisailam reservoir, located between the two states, and the expansion of the Pothireddypadu head regulator to draw an additional six to eight thousand million cubic feet (tmc) of water from the river.The Telangana government wrote to KRMB, strongly objecting to the new projects proposed by the neighbouring state. It said they were a gross violation of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act and went against the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT)’s award.KRMB sought an explanation from the Andhra Pradesh government, while the Jal Sakthi ministry directed the government to stop proceeding with the projects. Subsequently, the National Green Tribunal too issued an order staying the new projects.While replying to KRMB’s letter, the Andhra Pradesh government defended the projects, saying they would be well within the water share allocated to the state. It made a counter-complaint against Telangana, saying it too had taken up schemes such as the Palamuru-Ranga Reddy, Dindi, Bhakta Ramadasa and Tummilla projects on Krishna river that violated the state bifurcation act and KWDT’s award.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/krmb-to-hold-meeting-of-ap-telangana-officials-on-thursday-to-resolve-water-row/story-q77b2478YaN1xdHZjKu4aN.html
03-06-2020||India||USTR launches investigation into digital services taxes by India, nine other countries||New Delhi: The Trump administration has launched investigations into digital services taxes levied or under consideration by 10 countries, including India, to determine whether they discriminate against American tech companies, though people familiar with developments said New Delhi has no plans to change its levy.The investigations announced on Tuesday by the US Trade Representative (USTR) will cover digital taxes either adopted or under consideration in the European Union and 10 countries, including Austria, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Italy and the UK.The people cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said India has no plans to roll back the tax on e-commerce transactions introduced in the 2020 budget in February.“These investigations are just the start of a process. It’s not as if some actions have already been taken by the US,” said one of the people cited above.“Everything will depend on the findings of the investigations. So, it’s too early to say,” the person added.The USTR’s probe, called a “section 301 investigation” because it is conducted under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, will determine whether taxes on electronic commerce by the EU and the 10 countries discriminate against US tech giants such Apple, Google and Amazon.“This provision gives the USTR broad authority to investigate and respond to a foreign country’s action which may be unfair or discriminatory and negatively affect US commerce,” USTR said in a statement.Such investigations by the USTR can take months before the US administration decides whether to retaliate against taxes through tariffs or other measures.Amit Maheshwari, a partner at AKM Global, a tax and consulting firm, said: “The US investigation initially will focus on whether the digital services taxes (DSTs) discriminate against US companies, they are retroactive, and they reflect unreasonable tax policy, which would be when the DSTs may diverge from norms reflected in the US tax system and the international tax system in several respects such as extraterritoriality, taxing revenue not income, and a purpose of penalising particular technology companies for their commercial success.”He added, “The Indian tax, which is the subject of this investigation, was rushed in the recent Finance Act and made into law from April 1, 2020 without any consultations and gave very little time for the industry to prepare. Several countries in the world, including India, are adopting unilateral measures in the absence of multilateral consensus spearheaded by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). We don’t foresee global consensus happening anytime soon.”US tech companies, which have been very successful globally, are facing the brunt of “unilateral measures” and therefore this investigation has been launched, Maheshwari said.USTR has launched and completed a 301 probe into France’s digital services tax regime but held off on levying duties on the country as the two sides are negotiating a global regime at the OECD, Bloomberg reported. The OECD is trying to forge consensus among nearly 140 countries on a global tax overhaul to address how multinationals, especially tech giants, are taxed in countries where they have users or consumers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ustr-launches-investigation-into-digital-services-taxes-by-india-nine-other-countries/story-mNnoyZSzHwGyp90GHOAaaK.html

Testing facilities were increased in the past one week but results are taking time. According to the state health department’s bulletin, there were 7,004 results pending as of Wednesday.Amit Singh Negi, secretary health in the state said that testing facilities are gradually being ramped up in the state.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.“We understand that testing facilities were increased a little late in the state but we are working to increase them as much as possible. We are trying to tie up with two more private hospitals in Dehradun so that their labs can be used which will have a capacity of testing 200 samples each per day. We have also issued tenders for private laboratories to be used as testing centers,” said Negi.From Wednesday, a new testing center at Indian Institute of Petroleum, Dehradun was added in the state which has a capacity of testing around a hundred samples a day.“Not just in the state, we are trying to tie-up with labs already approved by the Central government in nearby areas like Chandigarh so that more samples can be tested in the coming days and the backlog can be reduced,” added the official.Speaking on chances of further spread of infection on account of delayed results of the samples, Negi said that the state government has increased the quarantine period to reduce the rate of infection.“Cases saw a sudden spike in the state after migrants started returning and now anyone returning to the state will first have to stay at an institutional quarantine facility for seven days and then strictly under home quarantine for 14 days. They will not be allowed to leave their house so even if they are carriers of the virus, it will be restricted to their homes,” said the secretary.Meanwhile, a senior official from the state health department who did not wish to be named said that in normal circumstances, it takes around one and a half days for results to be declared given that samples have been sent to the testing centers from remote areas.“It usually takes one and a half days or a maximum of two days if samples are sent for testing from remote areas of the state. In any situation, it should not take more than three days,” said the official.

Initially we felt soon everything will be under control and things will be back to normal but the spread is just unstoppable, I feel we have to learn to live with it. Its June now and Mumbai rains will soon start so now the situation is becoming more and more daunting.”Gungun is staying with her daughter (14), husband and a permanent help. “Since, she stays with us so I am not so helpless but I do pitch-in and cook or bake something off and on which was very rare before. Now, that I have time so this all is again a good utilisation of my time.”Just before the lockdown she shot for a web show, ‘Casino,’ telling more about the venture Gungun said, “We shot in Kathmandu and later in Mumbai. I have a small but an interesting role also it will be my first OTT show. The show stars Karanvir Bohra, Mandana Karimi and Sudhanshu Pandey. The characters I have played on TV have always been divine and positive like of Mata Yashoda in ‘Parmaavtar Sri Krishna’, Gotami in ‘Buddha’ and then I played the role of mother in ‘Gangaa’. With such image in TV, which of course I’m very proud of; so I thought I didn’t have much scope in the world of OTT. Also, I am not comfortable doing a bold avatar but what I got on web was something I knew was just right so I took it up. Thankfully, now many good shows are being made now which gives me hope. I would also like to play a negative character in future if only I get an opportunity.”The actor is worried about the condition of small time and new actors in the industry. “I am lucky that my husband is working and with me sitting home, I know our household will easily sustain. But, it’s going to be tough for those who are sole breadwinners of their families. Pending payments is another issue for actors. Besides, new shows not happening any time soon so we all are in a fix. My show ‘Sri Krishna’ is having a re-run. Many actors came up with an option that like abroad, the shows which are on a re-run must give some benefit or royalty to the actors too,” she shared.Gungun’s parents are based in Defence Colony, Lucknow. “My sister lives in South City and my in-laws are also from the Lucknow. Last year I visited and am looking forward to be in my hometown soon. Thankfully, we have lesser Covid-19 cases in the city,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/re-run-of-shows-must-benefit-actors-too/story-RBbzslhmWNox2JS3LlQEAM.html
03-06-2020||India||SC asks Jagan govt to remove party colours from panchayat buildings within four weeks||The Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday ordered the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy-led government in Andhra Pradesh (AP) to remove the colours painted on the gram panchayat buildings across the state within four weeks because they resemble that of the ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) flag.An SC division bench, headed by Justice Lavu Nageshwar Rao, dismissed a special leave petition (SLP) filed by the state government challenging an earlier order given by the Andhra Pradesh high court (HC) in this regard.The apex court directed that the party colours painted on the government buildings be removed within four weeks and warned that if the government did not comply with the order, it would be treated as contempt of court.The SC rejected the state government’s arguments that the colours painted on the government buildings did not resemble that of the YSRCP flag, but conveyed a different meaning.Earlier, the state government had issued an order in August 2019, around two months after coming to power to paint gram panchayat buildings in a specific green, blue and yellow colour scheme, which bears a striking resemblance to the YSRCP flag.It had also ordered the authorities to insert CM Reddy’s photograph on every panchayat building’s signboard, occupying at least 25% of the assigned space. The gram panchayats were told to incur the expenses for the new painting exercise.The HC had directed the state government to remove the YSRCP colours from the gram panchayat buildings while responding to a public interest litigation petition (PIL).The state government did not follow the HC order but issued a revised order, which tweaked the color scheme by adding another colour, terracotta, to give the impression that there was no similarity to the YSRCP flag.In May, the HC took exception of the state government’s unilateral action and struck down the revised order.On May 28, the court summoned AP chief secretary Nilam Sawhney and two other Indian Administration Service (IAS) officers and threatened to issue contempt proceedings if they did not follow its order on the removal of YSRCP colours from the government buildings.However, the government chose to file a fresh SLP in the SC that upheld the earlier HC order on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-jagan-govt-to-remove-party-colours-from-panchayat-buildings-within-four-weeks/story-aBgcfEbH5yVzE4vxJBPeKN.html

But when I reached home, people from our village insisted that I spend 14 days in quarantine in a tree house,” said the 21-year old.All people returning to Assam from other states have to spend a 14 days in institutional and home quarantine. Those who test negative for the Coronavirus are allowed to go home and spend the rest of the period in isolation.Residents of Ansaipur, who built the bamboo tree house on the outskirts of the village located close to the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border, insisted that Basumatary spend another 14 days in isolation, in addition to the three nights in institutional quarantine.“I’ve completed four nights in the tree house and have to spend 10 more. Though this is not as comfortable as home, I am willing to spend the next 10 days for the safety of other villagers,” said the Class IX dropout.Assam has been witnessing rains over the past few days, and the tree house covered with a plastic sheet leaks a bit whenever there is a heavy downpour. The people of the village have provided Basumatary 20 kg of rice but he has no other ingredient to prepare decent meals.“I wish they had given me some pulses and spices. I am eating yams and edible ferns found near the tree, but sometimes it gets tough. My elder brother, who stays in the village with his family, brings water for me. Fortunately, wild elephants that roam in this area haven’t come this way yet,” he said.Basumatary went to Chennai in 2018 and spent two years there, hoping to earn well and send money back to his family. But now he doesn’t wish to go back to Tamil Nadu, and plans to start farming in his village once his quarantine period is over.Kamaljyoti Borah, circle officer of Dhekiajuli, said: “I’m not aware of this specific case. But we know of cases in villages in the area where residents have constructed huts for returnees to undergo home quarantine.“Because of the spread of Covid-19, there’s a fear among villagers, plus most houses in the villages are small and don’t have enough rooms where someone can undergo home isolation according to the guidelines.”Till Tuesday, nearly 250,000 people had returned to Assam from different parts of the country. Assam recorded 1,673 Covid-19 cases till Wednesday afternoon, and nearly 1,500 of them were people who had returned from other states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-return-from-chennai-assam-man-forced-by-villagers-to-quarantine-in-tree-house/story-0Y5QEi1g9nPF6Rt7TU7mvK.html

Under the proposed amendments, essentials like grains, oil, pulses, potatoes, onions have been excluded from the Essential Commodities Act, Javadekar said. “Farmers can now export or store these commodities as they wish. These are our farmers’ demands pending for nearly 50 years now,” he said, adding that these restrictions will not be applicable again until unprecedented circumstances such as a period of calamity, war or inflation arise. “As a result of this, farmers will get good returns,” the minister said.

Such foreign nationals would not be permitted to travel to India on the strength of any electronic visa obtained earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-eases-visa-travel-restrictions-allows-certain-categories-of-foreign-nationals-to-come-to-india/story-7sUukoS0vnytEQyqGDO03O.html

03-06-2020||India||Plea in SC alleges 187 persons in bonded labour in brick kilns of UP, Bihar||A three-judge Supreme Court bench, headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao, on Wednesday issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh and Bihar governments and also asked the district magistrates (DMs) of Rohtas and Sambhal in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, respectively, to submit their reports regarding a public interest litigation (PIL) that had alleged 187 people were forced into bonded labourers in three brick kilns operating under their jurisdictions. The apex court ordered the DMs to file their reports on Monday, when the case would be heard next.Earlier on May 25, a plea was filed before the SC by a social worker Zahid Hussain, who had alleged that 187 people – all of them belong to the Scheduled Caste (SC) community -- were forced into bonded labour in three brick kilns in Bihar and UP and were made to work under inhuman conditions, including lack of food and non-payment of their statutory minimum wage.The local administrations allegedly didn’t take any action against the deplorable condition of the bonded labourers, despite an order issued by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on May 11, the plea stated.“The bonded labourers were left vulnerable. They were tortured by the brick kiln owners for complaining against their inhuman working conditions. The owners also threatened to throw them out of their jobs and refused to pay the statutory minimum wage,” the plea added.Advocate Srishti Agnihotri filed the plea on behalf of Hussain.Two of the brick kilns are located at Bharkol and Dhaudarh villages in Bihar’s Rohtas district, and another one is situated in western UP’s Sambhal district.Senior counsel Anitha Shenoy appeared for the petitioner, Hussain, and prayed for the release and rehabilitation of the 187 victims and also sought specific guidelines from the SC to repatriate them to their native places amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.He cited the viral outbreak has accentuated the bonded labourers’ woes.“From restrictions of their movements to lack of food supplies and healthcare, non-payment of wages and restricted access to law enforcement authorities, the bonded labourers are trapped in abusive conditions amid the pandemic. Besides, they have been pushed into working as bonded labourers to tide over their economic crisis,” the plea said.The petition said 41 bonded labourers, including 14 children, are trapped in the Bharkol brick-kiln, while in Dhaudarh there are 84 victims, including 27 children. Similarly, the Sambhal brick-kiln has 62 victims.Hussain contended that the bonded labourers have been held hostage at the brick kilns, denied their minimum statutory wage, physically and verbally abused, and even the women and children are made to work for over 12 hours at a stretch.“One of the labourers (at the Dhaudarh brick kiln) was assaulted on his head that left him bleeding profusely after he had asked for the payment of his wage. Three victims, who are four, five and nine months pregnant, respectively, have been denied any medical assistance,” the petitioner alleged.The plea stated the Sambhal district administration conducted a cursory inquiry of 17 families of the bonded labourers at the behest of the NHRC order.But, the district authorities ordered the labourers to stay put at the brick kiln and left them at the mercy of the owner, the plea alleged.The petitioner blamed the Sambhal district administration of gross dereliction of their duties.He made similar complaints against the Rohtas district authorities for their alleged failure to bring the guilty to book and set free the bonded labourers. Hussain cited the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, and the standard operating procedures (SOP) on rescue, release by the Union Ministry of Labour and Employment (MoLE) that stipulate a 24-hour deadline for the rescue of bonded labourers after a complaint is lodged.However, he alleged that the norms have been overlooked and the authorities concerned are yet to take any action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-sc-alleges-187-persons-in-bonded-labour-in-brick-kilns-of-up-bihar/story-6pUGQJATrygBWqjE69TlBI.html
03-06-2020||India||Over 1 lakh national IDs of Indians put on Dark Web for sale: Report||Over 1 lakh scanned copies of Indians’ national IDs, including Aadhaar, PAN card and passport, have been put on dark web for sale, cyber intelligence firm Cyble said on Wednesday.The leaked data seems to have originated from a third party and not from the government system, according to a report by Cyble. “We came across a non-reputed actor who is currently selling over 1 lakh Indian National IDs on the dark net. With such a low reputation, ideally, we would have skipped this; however, the samples shared by the actor intrigued our interest -- and also the volume. The actor is alleged to have access to over 1 lakh IDs from different places in India,” Cyble said. The personal data leaked by cyber criminals leads to various nefarious activities such as identity thefts, scams, and corporate espionage. Many criminals use the personal details in the IDs to win trust of the people over a phone call for fraudulent activities. The Cyble researchers acquired around 1,000 IDs from the seller and confirmed that the scanned IDs belong to Indians. “Preliminary analysis suggests that the data originated from a third party, and no indication or artefact is indicating that it came from a government system. At this point, Cyble researchers are still investigating this further -- we are hoping to share an update soon,” Cyble said. The scanned ID documents indicate that the data may have been leaked from a company’s data base in the segment where they have to comply with ‘Know Your Customer’ (KYC) norms. “Cyble researchers have also learned about a surge in KYC and banking scams -- leaks such as this are often used by scammers to target individuals, especially elderlies,” Cyble said. The cyber intelligence firm has recommended people to refrain from sharing personal information especially financial information over phone, e-mail or SMS. “Regularly monitor your financial transaction, if you notice any suspicious transaction, contact your bank immediately,” the company said. In May, Cyble showed two instances where personal data of 7.65 crore Indians have been put on sale in the dark web. In one instance, the seller claimed to have sourced data of 4.75 crore Indians from online directory Truecaller and in other, the seller claimed to have sourced from job websites. Truecaller, however, had denied the claim of breach in its database.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-1-lakh-national-ids-of-indians-put-on-dark-web-for-sale-report/story-tRQeExGVzO0lVYTpSwL0BP.html

Sharma’s body was fished out two days later from the drain on February 27.Also Read: In Crime Branch charge-sheet in Delhi riots case, a reference to Tablighi Jamaat“He was specifically targeted by a mob led by Tahir Hussain, a politician of Aam Aadmi Party and sitting councilor of EDMC Delhi,” the charge sheet seen by HT says.After Tahir Hussain’s name first surfaced for involvement in the riots, he was suspended and later expelled by AAP. Tahir, however, has in the past professed his innocence and claimed that he was not in the area when the incident happened.The police charge sheet says that Ankit Sharma was murdered outside Hussain’s house in Khajuri Khas area.The charge sheet adds that the bloodstained knife used to stab Ankit Sharma was found along with the bloodstained clothes of the killer. The blood found on the clothes was that of Ankit Sharma. It adds that another knife used in the crime was also recovered.The police also claim to have seized Tahir Hussain’s pistol but that is in relation to another matter. The police had earlier claimed to have also recovered locally made explosive materials from Hussain’s house but that doesn’t find any mention in the charge sheet.Some of the other people arrested in the case are Salman, Firoz, Javed, Gulfam, Shoyaib and Anas.Home minister Amit Shah had told Parliament in March that a breakthrough in Sharma’s murder was made possible by video evidence shared by the residents in the area, one of which captured one of the accused assaulting Sharma with a knife.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ex-aap-councilor-tahir-hussain-led-the-mob-that-killed-ankit-sharma-says-delhi-police-charge-sheet/story-plFr0Dq9hbwPvrU2hYoDLP.html

On his instructions, the adjacent and rival DRP Convent School was destroyed by the mob, according to the charge sheet accessed by Hindustan Times. This charge, the police said, had been substantiated on the basis of the security guards of the Rajdhani School as well as Farooque’s Rajdhani School.The reference to Farooque’s phone conversations with Tablighi Jamaat’s Abdul Aleem, 53, could mean more trouble for the Markaz, the headquarters of the Islamic sect in central Delhi’s Nizamuddin.The Markaz has been in the spotlight after thousands of coronavirus cases in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in the country were traced to congregations held at its headquarters in March this year. The sect’s leadership is already being probed for violating norms under the epidemic diseases law while its volunteers from abroad have been booked for violating visa norms and the Foreigners Act.Maulana Saad also faces investigations over charges of money laundering being probed by the Enforcement Directorate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-crime-branch-charge-sheet-in-delhi-riots-case-a-reference-to-tablighi-jamaat/story-PyAzLCOOE0RrfWEbzFnReL.html

He was specifically targeted by a mob led by Hussain, it further said in the chargesheet filed today.The police have also found the blood stained knife used to stab Sharma and the blood stained clothes of the killer. Hussain’s licensed pistol was also seized but in a separate case. The police had filed two chargesheets on Tuesday in connection with two separate cases registered during the communal rioting. In one of the chargesheets, the police named Hussain, alleging he played a “pivotal role” during the riots.The police said Hussain met former JNU student Umar Khalid, who, the department claimed, was part of a larger group organising the riots and protests in the city.Hussain has been charged under sections dealing with rioting, criminal conspiracy, dacoity, promoting religious enmity and under the Arms Act.At least 53 people were killed and around 400 injured in the violence that started as clashes between protesters for and against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA in February.Sharma’s body was found in a drain near his home in North-East Delhi’s Chand Bagh area on February 26, a day after he had gone missing after Delhi riots broke out. It had “multiple abrasion... deep cuts... by sharp edge objects” according to news agencies who quoted the doctors who conducted the autopsy.The IB staffer’s murder was one of the most highlighted cases of Delhi riots. Sharma had joined the IB as security assistant in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ib-staffer-ankit-sharma-killed-in-delhi-riots-was-stabbed-51-times-police-chargesheet/story-eLcOABeHFIjNJNCV14gOlO.html

The sessions were conducted at the relief centres where villagers living near the coast have been brought in. The Maharashtra administration has evacuated over 100,000 people from the coastline since Tuesday in preparation for the cyclone which made landfall at 11.30 am just south of Alibag in Raigad district. Heavy rains have been lashing the coastline since morning, particularly at Murud and Revdanda, where the NDRF camps witnessed the landfall.  Eight teams of the NDRF are stationed in Mumbai, four in Raigad, two each in Palghar, Thane and Ratnagiri districts, while one team is on standby in Navi Mumbai. State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) teams have been deployed in these districts too.Also read: Cyclone Nisarga landfall begins, will take 3 hours to completeA senior officer said that villagers have been instructed on basic Dos and Don’ts that are to be followed during the cyclone. Citizens have been asked not to venture near old buildings, temporary sheds or poles as well as power lines. “Wherever possible, we are undertaking sessions on how people need to take care of themselves before the cyclone hits. We are also adhering to social distancing norms,” he said. Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that the state machinery has been geared up for the Cyclone Nisarga. “Adequate force of NDRF, police, lifeguards, fire brigade have been deployed. Keeping the intensity of the cyclone in mind, citizens in the coastal parts of the state are requested to stay home,” Pawar said. The name, ‘Nisarga’ proposed by Bangladesh, means ‘nature’. It comes soon after cyclone Amphan that devastated the lives of over a million people and left 86 dead when it made landfall on May 20 at the Sunderbans, in West Bengal.The last severe cyclonic storm to hit close to Mumbai was in 1961. But climate scientists warned that devastation can be extensive as today’s Mumbai is very different from the Bombay of 1960s and has lost most of its floodplains and rivulets and is now counted as among the densest cities in the world.

03-06-2020||India||Chhattisgarh govt launches ‘Spandan Campaign’ to check suicide and fratricide||The Chhattisgarh government launched the Spandan Campaign on Wednesday to contain incidents of suicide and fratricide involving police personnel, and instructions were issued to senior officers to strictly adhere to guidelines in this regard.Chhattisgarh’s director general of police DM Awasthi issued an order to all superintendents of police and commandants of armed police forces, saying they should strictly follow instructions to curb suicides and incidents of fratricide.All superintendents of police will start a parade at police lines in their districts every Friday, keeping in mind social distancing, and grievances of personnel will be redressed after the event. The order made it mandatory for superintendents of police to facilitate counselling and medical treatment for depressed officers and staff by psychiatrists or psychologists in their district headquarters.Arrangements should be made for yoga classes for police personnel in all district headquarters. A roster should be prepared for this and the cooperation of local yoga teachers should be sought, the order stated.A total of 50 police personnel, including personnel of paramilitary forces, committed suicide in Chhattisgarh over the past two years. Eighteen of these cases were reported from seven districts of Maoist-affected Bastar division.Figures released by the Chhattisgarh government in February showed 22 police personnel committed suicide in 2018, while the toll was 26 in 2019. Two personnel have committed suicide till February this year.In December 2019, six ITBP personnel were killed in an incident of fratricide at a camp in Narayanpur, while two Chhattisgarh Armed Force (CAF) personnel were killed in a similar incident in their camp in Mingahcal village of Bijapur district last June.To curb such incidents, Awasthi said: “All police officers will visit police lines, police stations and armed forces companies and spend time with jawans to be aware of their problems. All commandants will rest at night with each company once a month. Similarly, superintendents of police have been directed to visit all police stations and police lines and listen to the problems of personnel.”For armed police forces, Awasthi instructed officers to redress grievances of personnel at regular intervals and to make arrangements for recreational activities.“Apart from this, arrangements for psychologists, music therapy, yoga education, sports, library etc will be made in the camps adjacent to all the inaccessible areas with immediate effect,” Awasthi said in the order.The order further stated an analysis of incidents of suicide and fratricide in the armed police forces and police stations in Maoist-affected areas had established that most incidents were caused by depression due to “loneliness and emptiness”.Therefore, all police stations and camps in Maoist-affected areas will have to arrange mandatory yoga sessions in the morning, and separate sessions on weapons handling and outdoor sports in the evening so that the personnel can join these activities every day, the order said.Joint meals at which senior and gazetted officers interact with the personnel should be organised once every three months in Maoist-affected and sensitive police stations, the order said.“A special mobile phone application is being prepared for monitoring problems of police personnel at the headquarters, which will be launched in the next 15 days. Through this app, policemen and their families will be able to communicate their problems to officials and these will be monitored by senior officials,” Awasthi said.An Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: “Most suicides are caused by depression, difficulty in getting leave sanctioned and homesickness. Chhattisgarh Police records broadly categorise 50% of suicides as having been caused by personal and, or, family reasons, 11% on account of illness, 8% by work-related reasons, and 13% for other reasons. The remaining 18% continue to be under investigation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-govt-launches-spandan-campaign-to-check-suicide-and-fratricide/story-kER1z478TQp1j3va7WGHEJ.html

Bobde told the petitioner on Wednesday that India is already called Bharat in the Constitution.While declining to entertain the plea, the top court said the petition could be considered as a representation to the government.A bench headed by the CJI and comprising Justices AS Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy asked the petitioner’s counsel, “Why have you come here? India is already called Bharat in the Constitution.” Advocate Ashwin Vaish, appearing for the Delhi-based petitioner, argued that the plea sought amendment to Article 1 of the Constitution.To which, the CJI replied, “We can’t do that.” He reiterated that India is already called Bharat in the Constitution. Vaish argued that the English name India did not represent the culture and tradition of the country; instead, its origin is Greek, and it is derived from the word ‘Indica’. Vaish said that historically there are many examples where ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ was used, and urged the top court to allow him to make a representation before the appropriate ministries. The top court said that this particular petition be treated as a representation by the Centre.The plea claimed that this will ensure citizens of the country to get over the colonial past and instil a sense of pride in the nationality. The petitioner argued that the time is ripe to recognise the country by its original and authentic name ‘Bharat’, especially when the cities have been renamed in accordance with Indian ethos. The plea said, “The removal of the English name though appears symbolic, will instil a sense of pride in our nationality, especially for the future generations. In fact, the word India being replaced with Bharat would justify the hard fought freedom achieved by our ancestors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-already-called-bharat-in-the-constitution-sc-s-no-to-changing-country-s-name/story-32QjLXz5NmKPNqMdm59rIP.html

Our prediction is at an initial stage. Error analysis will soon be updated on our website,” Huang Jianping, director of Lanzhou University’s Collaborative Innovation Center of Western Ecological Safety, who is heading the project told HT.By June 15, India could see more than 15,000 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 every day.India has recorded more than 8,000 cases for three consecutive days with the total number of infections now at over 2,00,000.The same system predicts that the US will see a daily increase of 30,000 new cases in June and major countries in Europe will witness a continuous drop in new daily cases.The dynamic forecasting model, which was unveiled online last week, takes into account the impact of climate and environmental conditions, population densities as well as control measures implemented by governments.“The spread of the virus is affected by many factors, including population density, quarantine measures, and of course the environmental factors,” Huang said.Also read: Another single-day jump in Covid-19 cases with 8,909 new infections; India’s tally at 2.07 lakh“Different factors contribute differently in different regions in the world.Meteorological factors can affect the spread of the virus. We believe it is necessary to consider the impact of temperature and humidity, although the degree of their influence varies in different regions,” Huang, the project leader, said.“For India, the high population density reduces the social distance and is conducive to the development of pandemic. The influence of temperature is limited, compared with other factors,” he said.Experts say that the number of new cases in India will rise as the government gradually eases the lockdown.“Before the release of the system, repeated verification and debugging were carried out. There are many factors affecting the development of the Covid-19, and we will continue to adjust and improve it according to the actual situation,” Huang said.The Centre’s prediction model is based on statistical epidemiology model and in the data in the model construction such as the number of confirmed cases and the death toll are from US’s Johns Hopkins University. Meteorological data such as temperature and humidity were taken from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and NASA. According to the research, usually the temperature most conducive for the spread of the novel coronavirus is between 5 degrees Celsius and 15 degrees Celsius, with 60 percent of the Covid-19 cases around the world reported within the temperature scope.“Our previous study found that 60 percent of the confirmed cases of Covid-19 occurred in places where the air temperature ranged from 5 °C to 15 °C, with a peak in cases at 11.54 °C and approximately 73.8 percent of the confirmed cases were concentrated in regions with absolute humidity of 3 g/m3 to 10 g/m3.”The content of nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere is taken into account as it is related to vehicular exhaust.According to Huang, if the nitrogen dioxide content is less in the atmosphere, it means non-pharmaceutical measures like lockdowns and restrictions on transport have been effective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-coronavirus-cases-will-cross-15-000-mark-a-day-by-mid-june-predicts-china-explains-why/story-RTODTcLlsG3QLUQVVMvQnI.html

Following this, the hospital where he worked, his home and his private clinic were declared containment zones and all those who were in contact with him were placed in quarantine.Sarma had on Monday visited Singimari Model Hospital in Kamrup district, which has been turned into a Covid-19 facility, to assess arrangements there. The doctor, who visits the hospital as part of his duties, was present during Sarma’s visit and was seen in close proximity to the minister.“We have placed Sualkuchi first referral unit (FRU) hospital, his home and private clinic under containment. Since Singimari Hospital is a Covid-19 facility, all required protocols are already maintained there,” Kamrup’s deputy commissioner Kailash Karthik N said.“Some doctors at Singimari Hospital, who used to treat Covid-19 patients, have been placed in quarantine. We have traced 121 close contacts of the doctor and sent their swab samples for tests. The doctor’s family members have also been put in home quarantine,” he said.A total of 79 Covid-19 patients are being treated at Singimari Hospital. Since the doctor also used to treat patients at his private clinic, efforts are on to trace those who visited the clinic or came in close contact with him.Debabrata Saikia, a Congress legislator and leader of opposition in the Assam assembly, said: “We have seen in news videos how guidelines for social distancing were flouted and the doctor, who tested positive, was standing very close to the minister during the visit [to Singimari Hospital].“I want to know from the health department if they would place Sarma and all those close to him under quarantine and test their swab samples as a precautionary measure.”Sarma, who has been travelling to all corners of Assam for the past three months and frequently interacting with doctors, people who have returned from other states and recovered Covid-19 patients, dismissed questions about his health.“I visit hospitals daily, interact with doctors and also Covid-19 positive patients. There’s no worry as long as you wear masks and follow other safety measures,” the minister told journalists on Tuesday while visiting another Covid-19 hospital in Dhubri district.Assam has recorded 1,622 Covid-19 cases till Wednesday morning. While 338 people have recovered, two have died, 1,277 are still being treated and three have gone back to their home states before recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctor-who-attended-event-with-assam-minister-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-UIFeW70nylfD00pkBXLbsO.html

ALSO WATCH | Amid cyclone, plane skids off runway in MumbaiAt the NDRF camp between Alibag and Murud, high-speed winds with a maximum level of 110kmph were recorded after the cyclone moved over the region, said the forces’ inspector Mahesh Kumar.Kumar added that around 2pm, the wind speed came down to 85-90kmph, as per information from the state India Meteorological Department (IMD).With the upper part of the cyclone passing over Alibag and reaching Panvel, Mumbai is likely to experience wind speeds of 75kmph.Also read | Cyclone Nisarga forces Mumbai airport to stop operations till 7 pmSeven coastal districts of Maharashtra have been put on red alert by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and heavy to very heavy rainfall is predicted for both Maharashtra and Gujarat.Nisarga’s name was proposed by Bangladesh and means ‘nature’ in Bengali.It comes in the wake of Cyclone Amphan that devastated the lives of over a million people and left more than 90 dead when it made landfall on May 21 at the Sunderbans in West Bengal.LandfallCyclone Nisarga started making landfall at 11.30am south of Alibag in Maharastra’s Raigad district with strong winds of 120 to 140kmph, stronger than expected, making it the second severe cyclone to hit Mumbai since 1961. RK Jenamani, a senior scientist at the weather forecast department, said Cyclone Nisarga will gradually enter Mumbai and Thane districts. “Landfall is just beginning. It will take three hours to complete the process,” Jenamani said.The cyclone was about 500km in size when it was in the ocean and its wind speed ranged from 110 to 120 kmph.The teams of NDRF on the ground witnessed Nisarga make landfall between Murud and Revdanda areas in Raigad district. “The severe cyclone made landfall at speeds up to 100kmph. It will pass from the landward end over Alibag just brushing past the taluka at wind speed ranging from 85-90 kmph,” Mahesh Kumar, inspector in charge of Cyclone Nisarga operations, said.Kumar added that two teams from Alibag were sent to landfall sites—both located at respective police stations of Revdanda and Murud for disaster operations.The last severe cyclonic storm to hit close to Mumbai was in 1961. But climate scientists warned that the devastation can be extensive as today’s Mumbai is very different from the Bombay of the 1960s and has lost most of its floodplains and rivulets and is now counted as among the densest cities in the world. When heavy rains lash over a city like Mumbai which has lost its flood plains and defences, the flooding gets prolonged, scientists said.Flights disrupted, traffic stoppedRain and high-speed wind continued to lash Mumbai as Cyclone Nisarga made landfall close to Alibaug, about 90km to the city’s south. The Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) said Cyclone Nisarga forced to cancel flight operations at the Mumbai airport between 2.30pm and 7pm. Twenty flights, including 12 departures and eight arrivals, were scheduled from Mumbai through the day.“In consultation with AAI, considering the strong crosswinds, it has been decided that no arrivals and departures will take place between 14:30-19:00 hrs,” a MIAL spokesperson said.The cyclone with a wind speed of 120 to 140kmph also forced authorities to close the Bandra-Worli sea link.Also read | Cyclone Nisarga: Nearly 1,00,000 evacuated, rains from Mumbai to HubliThe Maharashtra government has evacuated around 60,000 people from the state’s coastal region of Konkan and brought 7,003 fishing boats back to the shore with the help of disaster management authorities.Maharashtra energy minister Nitin Raut has warned that the cyclone is likely to cause severe damage to power lines and poles.“Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company’s officers, employees, contractors, and systems are prepared. Let’s all be vigilant and overcome this crisis,” he said.The Indian Railways has not cancelled any passenger trains on Central or Western Railway yet but rescheduled five.A tree fell between the Kurla and Vidyavihar railway stations and the railways has taken a lock has been taken to clear the tracks used for the operation of local train services.

03-06-2020||India||As Nisarga makes landfall, experts explain why Arabian Sea is witnessing more cyclones||Severe cyclone Nisarga, which made the landfall on Wednesday afternoon near Alibag in Maharashtra’s Raigad district, indicates an increasing frequency of severe cyclones developing in Arabian Sea in the past decade.Studies have linked this trend to climate change.In the past two years, the Arabian Sea has witnessed seven cyclones. However, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the ratio of cyclones in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal - which just witnessed the destructive cyclone Amphan on May 21 - is still 1:4. Also Read: Nearly 1 lakh people evacuated from coastal areas of MaharashtraThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) last year came out with a special report, Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, in which it said that extreme rainfall and extreme sea level events associated with some tropical cyclones are being seen to have a cascading impact on coastal areas.“There is emerging evidence for an increase in annual global proportion of category 4 or 5 tropical cyclones in recent decades,” the IPCC report had said.A category 4 cyclone has a wind speed of 209-251 kmph, and is referred to as an extremely severe cyclonic storm, while a category 5 cyclone has a wind speed of more than 252 kmph, and is referred to as a super cyclone. Cyclone Amphan, which hit Sundarbans on May 21, was categorised as a super cyclone, but made landfall as an extremely severe cyclonic storm.The IPCC report refers to a 2017 study led by Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Programme, of the United States’ Princeton University, which found that in 2014 and 2015, post-monsoon extremely severe cyclonic storms (ESCS) were first observed over the Arabian Sea causing widespread damage to the West coast.The study had concluded that climate change had led to an increase in the occurrence of ESCSs in the Arabian Sea. Hiroyuki Murakami is the lead author of the study who is also among few scientists globally who specialise in cyclones in the Arabian Sea.“Rising mean sea levels will contribute to higher extreme sea levels associated with tropical cyclones (very high confidence). Coastal hazards will be exacerbated by an increase in the average intensity, magnitude of storm surge and precipitation rates of tropical cyclones,” the IPCC report further stated.“The IPCC reports indicate that pre- and post-monsoon storms may increase over Indian Ocean in the future in a warming world,” said Mathew Roxy Koll, climate scientist at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and one of its authors.“This year, both Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal were about 1 degree warmer than normal (in early May) and hence the conditions were conducive to increasing the strength of the cyclones. A warmer ocean does not automatically mean there will be more cyclones but if the cyclones are born they will become stronger on account of a warmer sea. The number of cyclones in a given ocean depends on the existence of circulation patterns that are not related to climate change,” said J Srinivasan, Distinguished Scientist, Divecha Centre for Climate Change, Indian Institute of Science.“Since 1990, we are seeing an increasing trend of intense cyclonic storms over Arabian Sea. Some studies have attributed this increase to climate change but with low confidence,” Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general, IMD had said on Monday.“During Amphan, warmer oceans did allow the system to reach a super cyclone status but not in this case so far,” said Mohapatra. Warmer ocean temperatures are not the only parametre for rapid intensification of cyclones, he said. “We need to consider other parameters such as relative humidity in middle troposphere, and instability in the atmosphere allowing moist air to form aiding cloud formation through the help of convection. However, the frequency of cyclones has been abnormally high in Arabian Sea since last year and it is a fact that this zone is witnessing an increase in cyclones,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-nisarga-makes-landfall-experts-explain-why-arabian-sea-is-witnessing-more-cyclones/story-iV6TYHUzlCti5yljvfUpRL.html

MV Karnika has been detained at Mumbai port in lieu of a commercial admiralty suit.The bench of justice AK Menon, while hearing the interim application filed by the owners of MV Karnika, was informed by advocate S Priya that the vessel would be impacted by cyclonic weather as the India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s report of June 1 had indicated the path of Cyclone Nisarga lay across the Maharashtra coast.Priya said MV Karnika may be impacted by the cyclonic weather in view of the sheer size of the vessel, and it may be damaged or run aground and probably cause immense damage to other vessels. This could result in MV Karnika also taking in water, with disastrous consequences.The ship’s owners’ application sought permission for the vessel to go out of Mumbai port temporarily to safer waters, probably beyond the territorial waters while under arrest, and return after the cyclone has passed.The Mumbai Port Trust also filed an application to move the vessel to safer waters. Advocate Deepak Motiwala, appearing for the port trust, said it was extremely risky to bring the vessel into berth because once alongside, the strong currents driven by the weather would in all likelihood damage the berth and property of the port and other vessels.Watch: Cyclone Nisarga to hit Maharashtra today, NDRF teams deployed He further said that considering the dimensions of the vessel, it would not be possible for any number of tugs to control the vessel.After the plaintiffs in the suit, along with several caveators who have sought to recover Rs 30 crores from the vessel, agreed with the applications, the high court observed that MV Karnika and her crew and others must not be imperilled and must be permitted to leave for safer waters, as may be suggested by the port trust in consultation with the master of the vessel, in order to avoid the path of the cyclone.The court then imposed several conditions, which include having a pilot of the port trust board and stay on the vessel till its return to Mumbai port. It also asked for the passports of the vessel’s three main officers to be deposited with the deputy conservator along with the certificate of registry and class certificate of the vessel.The court also sought an undertaking from the owners of the vessel to ensure its return to Mumbai port. On compliance with these conditions, the court directed the port trust to allow the vessel to leave immediately after receiving the application to leave from the vessel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-court-allows-detained-vessel-to-move-out-of-mumbai-port-till-cyclone-nisarga-passes/story-YGfYEJlK0ecbDWUXIzeNEM.html

I appeal to Central Govt to transfer ₹10,000 each as one-time assistance to migrant labourers including people in unorganized sector. A portion of PM-CARES could be used for this,” Banerjee wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.Her demand came a day after her government claimed to have transferred Rs 20,000 to the bank account of each of those whose homes got destroyed by the cyclone Amphan. “I’m happy to share that GoWB has transferred funds to nearly 5L affected people for repairing their homes, released crop damage assistance to 23.3L farmers, apart from 2L betel farmers. We’ve released ₹1444 Cr so far, against an initial estimate of ₹1350 Cr,” she said on Tuesday.Also read: Bengal Guv takes ‘strong exception’ to TMC minister for calling him as ‘BJP man’Following her demand, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national secretary Rahul Sinha said that the chief minister is trying to divert attention from her mismanagement in bringing migrant workers back from other states.“The Centre had to give several pushes to the state government to make it agree to allow Shramik Special trains in the state. Migrant workers are angry with her because of her apathy. She is trying to skip her responsibilities of finding these workers alternative jobs,” Sinha said.According to the state government, more than 5 lakh migrant workers have returned to Bengal using trains, buses and other transport vehicles.The Trinamool Congress has been alleging that the crisis of the migrant workers was created by the Centre’s “unplanned lockdown announcement.” The chief minister had also alleged that the railways’ move to send trains packed with migrant workers – with the middle berths not left vacant – was leading to a spike in the spread of Covid-19 among migrant workers and ultimately resulting in the spread of the disease in rural Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-seeks-rs-10-000-cash-transfer-from-centre-to-each-migrant-worker/story-wgmU04MFRBgzm542nSOfaI.html

Also read | 500 emergency response team members on standby as Mumbai braces for Cyclone NisargaThe city is already reeling under a high caseload of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, and the possibility of inundation of low-lying areas has raised concerns over the strain on healthcare infrastructure and municipal resources.A predicted storm surge of about 1-2 metres height above astronomical tide is likely to inundate low lying areas of Mumbai, Thane and Raigad districts and 0.5-1 metre height above the astronomical tide is likely to inundate low lying areas of Ratnagiri district during the time of landfall.WATCH | Cyclone Nisarga makes landfall in Maharashtra today, NDRF teams deployedA June 2 Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services bulletin indicated a very rough sea along the Konkan coast: from 5.30pm on Tuesday to Wednesday evening, the wave height could be as high as 2.5 to 4 metres in Thane; 2.5 to 4.5 metres in Greater Mumbai; 3 to 6.5 metres in Ratnagiri; and 3 to 5.5 metres in Sindhudurg.Also read | More than 4,000 people evacuated from Cyclone Nisarga landfall site Alibaug near Mumbai“The last severe cyclonic storm to hit close to Mumbai was in 1961. This storm is severe but with a wind speed of only 100 to 110kmph. Important thing is to take all precautions possible which state governments are trying. Inundation is possible so evacuation of vulnerable people is important,” M Mohapatra, IMD’s director general, had said on Tuesday.“It is not common for tropical cyclones to hit Maharashtra coast. Usually, during monsoon onset the cyclones that develop move towards Oman and Yemen coasts. The track of the cyclone is completely dependent on wind direction and pressure while warm ocean surface gives energy and intensity to the cyclone,” Sunita Devi, the head of the national weather forecasting centre, said.The sea surface temperature in parts of the Arabian Sea is 31 to 32 degree Celsius compared to 28 degree Celsius expected during this season.Nisarga is the 65th named cyclone in the north Indian Ocean and its name, proposed by Bangladesh, means ‘nature’ in Bengali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-nisarga-makes-landfall-in-maharashtra-s-alibag-mumbai-receives-rains/story-FBkLanKy01MVM4oG6EQsaI.html

The researchers analysed genomes from India in the GISAID global database between early March and the last week of May. On June 2, the database showed more than 37,000 genomes, of which at least 550 were from India. “Plotting the variants on the country’s map, we found that states such as Delhi, Telengana and Gujarat were the most heterogeneous. Those in the northeast showed the least number of variants,” said Bhim Joshi, one of the researchers in the team.Delhi recorded around 39 variants, while Ahmedabad in Gujarat alone recorded 60 variants, and 13 were found in Gandhinagar. At least 55 variants were found in Telengana. In Maharashtra and Karnataka, the team found around 15 variants each.“We found that two variants or haplo-groups (a genetic population that share a common ancestor) are most dominant. While one came from Wuhan in China, the other is the European variant,” said Mukesh Thakur, a scientist with the Centre for DNA Taxonomy who headed the research team.“Even though the initial variant had come from Italy, later variants from other countries in Europe also contributed heavily. Hence, we are calling it the European variant. Other variants, such as the ones which originated in Iran and Dubai, were found in (lower) numbers.”India’s first Covid-19 case was a medical student evacuated from Wuhan, who tested positive on January 30, which reported the country’s first three cases. On March 2, two more cases of travellers back from Italy and Dubai were reported by the Union health ministry, following which the number of cases steadily increased. “Of the nearly 200 variants we have spotted, one mutation was the most common. It has been named D614G. It was not the most prevalent mutation in India, but found in large numbers in Europe and the US. How the mutation has helped the virus, and whether its transmission modes have changed, need to be further studied,” said Abhishek Singh, another team member.All viruses mutate with time, and studies from other countries shown that Sars-Cov-2 has also mutated. The mutations do not lead to easier or faster transmission, or make the disease less or more severe, but it helps scientists to understand the behaviour of the virus and also in developing an effective vaccine, said Joshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-and-european-variants-of-sars-cov-2-most-prevalent-in-india/story-ESysIl4iFlTXUT1bNWfLZI.html

He added that number of patients in intensive care and ventilators are very less.He also spoke about hydroxychloroquine and remdisivir, the medicines which are being touted as cure for Covid-19. “Remdisivir can decrease the hospitalisation time, but it cannot reduce the death rate in serious patients. Hydroxychloroquine too is helpful for people with mild symptoms,” said Dr Guleria.The AIIMS Director said that there is no community spread in India, but people need to be cautious in hotspots.India on Wednesday saw another record spike in the number of new Covid-19 cases.

In mid-April it was around 3.3%, then it dropped to 3.25%, later to 3.15%, and as on today we stand at 2.82%, they said.“If you look at individual countries, some countries have even reported as high as 82 deaths per lakh population. This says how our focus on early case detection and robust contact tracing in containment zones has been in the right direction, and it will continue to be our main strategy in future also, along with ramping up the Covid testing capacity,” Lav Agarwal, the ministry’s joint secretary, said.India’s daily Covid-19 testing capacity is about 140,000 samples currently and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is aiming to scale it up to about 200,000 samples a day in the next two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-single-day-jump-in-covid-19-cases-with-8-909-new-infections-india-s-tally-at-2-07-lakh/story-nINYFp4wkOyTVS1r1iPrPK.html

The development came a few days after the Haridwar police, in the ongoing probe of the case, recorded her statement in Delhi where she is currently staying. Pandya was questioned a couple of days ago at his residence in Haridwar. The victim, who hails from Chhattisgarh, came to Haridwar from Delhi to record her statement before the court. Senthil Avoodai K Raj, Senior Superintendent of Police, Haridwar confirming the development said, “The statement of the victim was recorded before the local court on Tuesday amid police security considering the high-profile case.”Apart from confirming the development, Senthil however, refused to reveal much about the case and said, “As it is a serious case, not much can be told to media but a probe is on in the case.”The case had come to light after the victim, hailing from Chhattisgarh, lodged her complaint against Pandya in Delhi in early May where she is currently staying. In her complaint, she had stated that she was allegedly raped, harassed and intimidated by Dr Pranav Pandya and his wife Shail Bala Pandya in 2010 when she was working as a kitchen attendant at their Haridwar-based Gayatri Pariwar ashram in Shantikunj.Following the case, Pandya refuted the allegations and later got a stay from the court against his arrest. Terming the allegations as baseless, he had said that, “The lodging of the complaint by the woman after a decade of the alleged incident itself speaks of the false narrative and clandestine way the woman has plotted. She is just trying to tarnish my image.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dr-pranav-pandya-rape-case-victim-against-gayatri-parivar-head-records-statement-before-court/story-vkhaiISNF2PHBax0uryhbN.html

Etah, Aligarh, Agra and Mahoba along with other districts will experience winds with speeds over 60kmph in the next 24 hours, according to the warning issued by the IMD on Tuesday.A majority of these districts fall in the Bundelkhand and Agra regions of the state.Cyclone Nisarga is expected to hit coastal Maharashtra and Gujarat on Wednesday afternoon.“Cyclones cause the negative air pressure in a large area that causes weather disturbances. Some parts of central UP will be affected by it,” JP Gupta, UP’s meteorological department director, said. The state MeT department has issued a warning to the government, which has been relayed to respective districts.“The district administration has been asked to stay on an alert and make suitable arrangements to tackle emergencies caused due to these weather conditions,” Gupta added.More than 30 people had been killed when regions of the state witnessed weather disturbances over the last weekend. The victims were either struck by lightning or died due to natural calamities between May 29 and May 31.The district administrations have started making public announcements for people to stay indoors. They were warned about lightning and heavy winds, which were expected in the region.“We have also alerted the electricity and health department to make the required arrangements,” said a senior official in the state disaster management department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-20-up-district-on-alert-for-strong-winds-rain-and-lightning-over-cyclone-nisarga/story-kUdBwMjsADINShd44gaYnN.html

It gets difficult for us to control the elephant movement as different areas have different jurisdictions. So, we decided to have a joint team with officials from both the forest department and the Rajaji administration for controlling conflict. This way we will have administration authority from both the areas and a quick decision can be taken,” said Verma.The director added that a similar team has been formed for leopards, but it is a more localised issue.“Conflict due to leopard is a more localised issue and they don’t travel that much unlike elephants who travel across divisions. Conflict due to leopard happens at certain spots and both the forest department and Rajaji administration is equally equipped to tackle with that but still, a team has been formed,” added Verma.Each team will have around seven to 12 members that will work in coordination with each other.On May 27, an injured elephant who was rescued after a 14-hour-long operation, succumbed to its injuries.Forest and Rajaji Tiger Reserve (RTR) officials said that the rescue operation which commenced on May 26 morning went on till late at night. The injured elephant was spotted near Chilla Canal in RTR, in the midst of a canal, after it came therefrom Chilla-Rishikesh road, where it had created panic among the passersby.Veterinarian and tranquilising specialist Dr Aditi Sharma along with other park and wild life specialist carried out the tranquilising operation successfully. But owing to the elephant being injured and remaining in river water for several hours led to drastic deterioration of its health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-different-teams-to-now-rescue-elephants-and-leopards-in-uttarakhand-s-rajaji-park/story-om3IJDgVPt2nrBqhRRyfuM.html

Its peak wind speed as per the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC; a joint United States Navy and Air Force command situated at Guam in the Pacific Ocean) is going to be around 85 km/hr. While it continues to be a cyclonic storm, time is running out for it to gather strength before it makes landfall and (we will) witness a gradual loss in intensity,” said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and Ph.D. researcher at the University of Reading. “Prospects of rapid intensification are reducing which could have made things worse for Mumbai, Alibag and other regions. The impact is expected to be certainly less than previous official estimates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/light-overnight-rain-moderate-wind-speed-over-mumbai-ahead-of-cyclone-nisarga/story-bujaST4gjIGJkrBldl6rVN.html

Even though landfall site is south of Alibaug, extensive damage can be expected in Raigad, Mumbai, Thane and neighbouring areas,” said Sunita Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.The diameter of the eye of the storm has decreased in the past hour and is about 65 km at present, indicating an intensification of the weather system. The wind speed too has increased from 85-95kmph to 90-100kmph (gusting to 110kmph). The eye is the region of calm weather at the centre of tropical cyclones. As conditions indicate further intensification, wind conditions will increase up to 100-110 gusting to 120 kmph. A higher sea surface temperature and low vertical wind shear favoured the intensification of severe cyclonic circulation, said IMD scientists earlier.IMD has issued a red alert for at least seven coastal districts of Maharashtra, while several districts along Gujarat’s coast are also expecting heavy rainfall.Efforts to evacuate residents of these coastal districts were underway all of Tuesday even as the Prime Minister’s Office assured all help to state officials.Mumbai, which is on the path of the cyclone, will likely receive very heavy rainfall upwards of 164mm. The city is already reeling under a high caseload of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, and the possibility of inundation of low-lying areas has raised concerns over the strain on healthcare infrastructure and municipal resources.A predicted storm surge of about 1-2 metres height above astronomical tide is likely to inundate low lying areas of Mumbai, Thane and Raigad districts and 0.5-1 metre height above the astronomical tide is likely to inundate low lying areas of Ratnagiri district during the time of landfall.A June 2 Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services bulletin indicated a very rough sea along the Konkan coast: from 5.30pm on Tuesday to Wednesday evening, the wave height could be as high as 2.5 to 4 metres in Thane; 2.5 to 4.5 metres in Greater Mumbai; 3 to 6.5 metres in Ratnagiri; and 3 to 5.5 metres in Sindhudurg.“The last severe cyclonic storm to hit close to Mumbai was in 1961. This storm is severe but with a wind speed of only 100 to 110kmph. Important thing is to take all precautions possible which state governments are trying. Inundation is possible so evacuation of vulnerable people is important,” M Mohapatra, IMD’s director general, said on Tuesday.“It is not common for tropical cyclones to hit Maharashtra coast. Usually, during monsoon onset the cyclones that develop move towards Oman and Yemen coasts. The track of the cyclone is completely dependent on wind direction and pressure while warm ocean surface gives energy and intensity to the cyclone,” Sunita Devi, the head of the national weather forecasting centre, said.The sea surface temperature in parts of the Arabian Sea is 31 to 32 degree Celsius compared to 28 degree Celsius expected during this season.Nisarga is the 65th named cyclone in the north Indian Ocean and its name, proposed by Bangladesh, means ‘nature’ in Bengali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-nisarga-closes-in-215km-from-mumbai-imd/story-tv1tkoMNdTPFluAGXy39oM.html
03-06-2020||India||Podcast: Binalakshmi Nepram on the Realities of India’s Oft-Forgotten Northeast||Here’s a hard truth about policy conversations on India: we rarely hear about India’s northeast. In fact, in doing more than 50 episodes of this podcast, not even one has been dedicated to the northeastern region of the country. The Northeast is a region of immense geostrategic importance. It is home to nearly 50 million Indian citizens. It is also home to South Asia’s longest running armed conflict, where over 50,000 people have died. And, yet, it is often written off as a footnote, an outlier or part of the periphery.  To enlighten us--and to educate us--about this often overlooked corner of India, social activist and indigenous leader Binalakshmi Nepram joins Milan Vaishnav (Director of the South Asia programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace) on the show this week. Bina is the Founder of the Manipur Women Gun Survivors Network and also serves as Convenor of the Northeast India Women Initiative for Peace. Bina and Milan discuss the impact of COVID-19 on the Northeast, how the region fits into India’s popular imagination, the intense discrimination the region’s citizens endure, and the decades-long conflict that has upended the lives of tens of millions of ordinary Indians. Plus, Bina tells Milan about what inspired her to establish two of the Northeast’s leading human rights groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/binalakshmi-nepram-on-the-realities-of-india-s-oft-forgotten-northeast/story-Iy5Kt3gQOrumOhpAjw3JxH.html

They were admitted to hospital after complaining of shortness of breath.“Six more cases have been found, four among the same family and two neighbours,” Goa’s Health Secretary Nila Mohanan said on Tuesday.One of the couple’s three sons - a police constable - and one daughter-in-law are among those who have been found Covid-19 positive. “Today we conducted 200 tests in the high risk zone as well as on people with co-morbidities and in the immediate vicinity of the house where the family is living,” Mohanan said, adding that the health authorities will continue to expand the radius of their testing till they are satisfied that the outbreak has been contained. The private medical practitioner who had referred the couple to the hospital has been confirmed as negative. Health Minister Vishwajit Rane too visited the containment zone “to assess the situation on the ground”.“To access the ground situation at Mangor hills and review the implementation of containment strategy as per the National Covid-19 Action Plan, I shall be visiting the containment zone to discuss further course of action to control the spread of the virus,” Rane said. No clear travel link has emerged leaving the health authorities flummoxed as to how the family contracted the virus. There are 1,700 to 2,000 people living inside the containment zone, Mohanan said. Before Monday, all people found positive in the state were those who had travelled from outside the state. This is the first instance of a person without a clear travel history who has been found positive. Goa’s total confirmed cases have climbed to 79 while the number of active cases has fallen to 22 after 13 patients recovered from the disease.The fresh positive cases come at a time when Goa was gearing up to grant further relaxations including reopening of restaurants, malls and gymnasia and allowing religious services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-more-covid-19-positive-cases-found-in-vasco-da-gama-containment-zone-goa-s-total-tally-reaches-79/story-Im9Hx9r9Kja4uSK56oja6N.html

When one of our staff members went to saw the elephant, it was observed that the wound in the lower jaw area was exposed. Later, for at least 24 hours the animal was trying to look for water and on May 24 we received information that the animal has come into river Velliyar,” said Wildlife Officer, Silent Valley National Park.Also read: 6 days after its capture, elephant dies at Assam training facility“Even then the animal did not take any solid matter and only took water. It was very weak so we called a vet, he was of the opinion that it may not be possible to revive back but will see what options are available. Later we were told to observe the animal’s behaviour,” he added. The Wildlife Officer said they later planned to take the elephant out of the river but by then she had collapsed. “Today we thought of taking the animal to a safe spot to examine. Anyway, we had very little hope of reviving the animal because it has not been eating for many days. So, before we could take the animal out of the stream, it had collapsed and we hope it was a peaceful death,” he said. The officer informed that two doctors are here at the spot to carry out the post-mortem and after that, the carcass will be burnt.“The cause for the death is yet to be discovered and further investigation is underway,” he added. The elephant was seen standing in the river with her mouth and trunk in the water, for some relief from the pain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pregnant-elephant-dies-after-being-fed-pineapple-stuffed-with-crackers/story-WJtSwUfIegXRTDV3Lfo7TP.html
03-06-2020||India||We will get our growth back, PM Modi tells India Inc||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday voiced confidence in the economy’s ability to return to a path of rapid growth, listing it among his government’s top priorities and pledging its commitment to systematic reforms amid concerns that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic could plunge India into a prolonged slowdown.“Yes! We will definitely get our growth back,” Modi said in his speech to a conference on ‘Getting Growth Back’ organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) to mark the organisation’s 125th anniversary, as India emerges from the Covid-19 outbreak and subsequent 68-day lockdown.“Some of you may think in this time of crisis how could I say this with such confidence? There are many reasons for this confidence. I’ve confidence in India’s capabilities and crisis management. I’ve confidence in India’s talent and technology; I’ve confidence in India’s innovation and intellect. I’ve confidence in India’s farmers, MSMEs [micro, small and medium enterprises] and entrepreneurs,” Modi said in Hindi through a video link.Modi’s first major speech on the economy since the post-Covid-19 lockdown began on March 25 came a day after Moody’s Investors Service cut India’s rating by one notch to the lowest investment grade with a negative outlook, citing growing risks that Asia’s third largest economy will face a prolonged period of slower growth. According to official data released on Friday, the economy grew 3.1% in the three months ended March 31, 2020, and 4.2% — the slowest pace in 11 years — in the financial year 2019-20. The prolonged nationwide lockdown in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic is expected to dent growth further.Moody’s said the lowering of India’s rating reflects its view that “the country’s policy making institutions will be challenged in enacting and implementing policies which effectively mitigate the risks of a sustained period of relatively low growth, significant further deterioration in the general government fiscal position and stress in the financial sector.”Congress member of Parliament Rahul Gandhi took note of Moody’s action in a Twitter post.  “Moody’s has rated Modi’s handling of India’s economy a step above JUNK,” he wrote. “Lack of support to the poor and the MSME sector means the worst is yet to come.”The upbeat note struck by Modi in his speech cheered the financial markets. The benchmark Sensex index of the Bombay Stock Exchange rose 522.01 points, or 1.57%, to 33,825.53 and the National Stock Exchange’s Nifty gained 152. 95 points, or 1.56%, to 9,979.10. The rupee gained 18 paise to 75.36 per dollarModi said one of the “highest priorities” of his government is to strengthen the economy.“For this the government is taking decisions required to be taken immediately. And simultaneously, such decisions have also been taken that would help the country in the long run,” he said. The Prime Minister was referring to the ~20.97 lakh crore citizens welfare and economic stimulus packages announced between March 26 and May 17 that included free foodgrains and direct cash benefits to the poor, credit guarantee schemes for the industry, monetary measures by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and wide-ranging policy reforms.India has left behind the lockdown and has entered into “unlock phase one” and a major part of the economy has restarted, Modi said. “Today we are able to do this because when coronavirus was spreading globally, India took right steps at the right time. When we compare us with other countries, we come to know about the effectiveness of the lockdown in India,” he said.“The Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) helped in giving immediate relief to the poor. Under this scheme, rations have been provided to 740 million beneficiaries. Free rations are also being supplied to the migrant labourers,” he said. He said the package helped the poor and 80 million of them got free cooking gas cylinders under the scheme. PMGKY was the first response to Covid-19 that was announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on March 26. Prime Minister Modi said the entire package was a combination of providing relief to the underprivileged and restoring the economy along with policy reforms. “For us, reform is not a random or scattered decision. For us, reform is systematic, planned, integrated, inter-connected and futuristic process. For us, reform means dare to take decisions and take them to the logical conclusion,” he said.He said five things are necessary to take India on the higher growth trajectory — intent, inclusion, investment, infrastructure and innovation. “You can get a glimpse of them also in the bold decisions taken recently,” he said. The government has given farmers the freedom to sell their produce without having to go through middlemen. Modi said labour laws were being reformed to create more job opportunities and the private sector participation has been allowed in strategic sectors such as space and nuclear energy.Modi said the path of growth was self-reliance and the world had great expectations from India. “India has potential, strength and ability. All of you should, India’s industry should take full advantage of the trust the world has for India,” he said.He added: “Getting growth back is not that difficult. And, above all you have, Indian industries have a clear path, which is the path of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India).”“It is about creating a strong enterprise in India. Enterprises that can become global forces. it about generating employment. It is about empowering our people to come out and create solutions that can define the future of our country,” he said.Separately, electronics, information technology and communications minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said India had emerged as the second-largest manufacturer of mobile phones in the world.“From just 2 factories, we now have 200 manufacturing units. India’s electronic manufacturing was worth ~190,366 crore in 2014, today it’s ~458,000 crore. India’s global share in electronics has risen from 1.3% in 2012 to 3% in 2018. Electronic production has surpassed exports,” he said. He also said that the Centre was working towards constructing a robust manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Sunil Kant Munjal, a past president of the CII and one of the founders of the Hero Group, said industry will play probably the most crucial role in making India self-reliant. “The Atmanirbhar Bharat which PM Modi talked about... will rightly be driven by the five ‘I’s — intent, inclusion, investment, infrastructure and innovation,” Munjal said. “Another ‘I’ of internet would be important too, though one could say that infrastructure would cover that. For India to stay safe and maintain modest growth in these difficult times, it is important that both government and industry show their best intent to take bold decisions and make tough choices which will make us competitive, strong, agile and better prepared to face the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-will-get-our-growth-back-pm-modi-tells-india-inc/story-hTq4aKeGeALMc4XSEaa1kI.html
03-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What we still don’t know||It’s the end of one quarter of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic in India. Sure, the first cases in India, three people from Kerala who returned from Wuhan, China, the birthplace of the virus, date back to late January, but the number stayed at three for a long time. The next cases were recorded on March 2, making June 1 (Monday) the end of the first three months of the pandemic’s run in India.Tuesday, the beginning of the second, saw another milestone – India crossed 200,000 Covid-19 cases. The country ended Tuesday with 207,112 cases, of which 101,070 remain active. It is seventh in the list of countries in terms of number of cases. There have been 5,753 deaths so far and 100,289 have recovered. The country is currently testing just a little under 3,000 people per million population, although some states are doing much more. Tamil Nadu is testing 6,650 people per million; and Delhi 10,979.The number of daily cases in India continues to rise – the trailing five-day average on Tuesday was 8,025 – as does the number of daily deaths (the trailing five-day average was 215). Last week (on May 26), the corresponding five-day trailing averages were 6,775 daily cases and 154 daily deaths.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThere’s still a lot we do not know about the trajectory of the pandemic in India, and this is a good time to revisit these.One, we have no idea why the death rate in India, 2.8% on Monday, is much lower than the global 6%. Is it because the virus affects Indians differently? Is it because the BCG vaccine, almost universally given to children in India (for decades) helps Indians infected by the Sars-CoV-2 virus deal with it better? We don’t know. Nor do we know why the proportion of those needing critical care or ventilator support is lower in India than what it was in Italy and the US, two countries ravaged by the disease.Two, we have no idea what the actual death rate in India is. That’s because we are likely underestimating the number of cases. Positivity rates – the number of people testing positive to those tested – continue to rise across most states, including hot spots such as Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Delhi, which together account for around 57-58% of all cases in India, and 61% of active cases. Across the world, positivity rates continue to increase up to a point as the number of tests increase, then plateau, and finally start dipping. India is yet to reach that stage – indicating that we are still not testing enough, but this will only serve to reduce the death rate further. Indeed, while we do not know what the actual death rate is, we do know that it is probably lower than 2.8% (because we are underestimating cases).Three, are we also underestimating the number of deaths in India? After all, studies by the New York Times and the Financial Times have shown that many countries are, and significantly. The fragmented data available says we are not – there is no spike in the number of non-Covid deaths in March and April – but it makes sense to wait till we can get more comprehensive data. That’s another question to which the best answer would be: we don’t know.Four, we do not know how many Indians have been infected by the virus – and are therefore immune to it. There have been no widespread serological (blood) antibody tests that can provide this information.Five, we have no idea why the virus affects different geographies differently. For instance, Bengaluru is one of India’s most connected cities; it is home to tens of thousands of migrants from other states (and even other countries), yet it has a fraction of the cases that Delhi or Mumbai have.It is important we find answers to at least some of these — they will help us deal better with the coming peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-we-still-don-t-know/story-DulnyVY3lT4uSbqTtJSWFP.html
03-06-2020||India||Covid cases cross 200,000; rural clusters new challenge||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in India surpassed 200,000 on Tuesday, nearly doubling over 15 days, even as a considerable reopening of national transport and business activity fuelled fears of localised outbreaks emerging in new areas beyond urban hot spots that have so far pushed the contagion.Globally, there are now 6.4 million infections of Sars-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, and close to 380,000 deaths. In India, the number of fatalities on Tuesday was 5,753. The case fatality rate (CFR) in the country, however, stood at 2.8%, lower than the worldwide figure of 5.9%. About a fourth of India’s total infections have been reported over the past week.“Our Covid-19 fatality rate of 2.82% is among the lowest in the world, compared to a global fatality rate of 6.13%. We have been able to achieve this due to timely identification of cases and proper clinical management,” Union health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said at a news briefing on Tuesday.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageOfficial data from states showed 100,289 patients have so far recuperated from the disease in the country, taking the recovery rate to 48.4%, which is among the most promising figures on the infection across the world. The low CFR and high recovery rate indicate that India may not be witnessing an impact as severe as in some of the other countries ravaged by the pathogen.While experts say the peak of the outbreak is yet to come, an analysis on preprint server medRxiv showed that there could be independent regional crests across the vast geography of the country at different points in time. “The peaks might start as early as the end of July in some states and go all the way to September in many others,” said the research paper titled ‘Lockdown Effect on Covid-19 Spread in India’. Some studies also expect another infection spurt in winter this year.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said India was “far away from the peak”. “Our preventive measures to curtail Covid-19 have been very effective,” said ICMR scientist Nivedita Gupta.In the 93 days since the outbreak began, total infections were at 207,112 and 5,753 people died of the disease till Tuesday. Three states – Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi – currently account for half of all infections in the country but the Union government has identified 145 new districts, mostly rural, that have reported cases over the past three weeks and could emerge as “epicentres”. New infections have been reported among the millions of migrants returning to their home towns from urban centres amid a national lockdown that has slowed economic activity.The latest 50,000 infections were recorded in a week. India reported its first 50,000 Covid-19 cases in nearly 66 days, with a wave of infections beginning in March after three isolated cases were first reported in Kerala in January. It took 12 days for the cases to climb from 50,000 to 100,000.The disease’s doubling rate, which is defined as the average period it takes for a twofold rise, changed from 13.9 days on May 18 – the day the cases hit 100,000 – to 15.2 on Tuesday. The rate was four days at the beginning of April.With a surge in Covid-19 cases, India has overtaken Germany and France to become the seventh biggest hot spot of the pathogen, which has rapidly swept the entire globe.“It is wrong comparison to look at total number of Covid-19 cases only and mention that India has the seventh highest cases. Our population too should be considered... Fourteen countries with total similar population as India have reported 22.5 times more cases and 55.2 times deaths,” Agarwal said.Experts say the cases are expected to surge as India exits the national lockdown – necessitated by the pandemic – in a graded manner and could spread to the rural parts of the country. The Centre has also reoriented its strategy against the outbreak – from asking people to “stay home” to break the chain of infections, it is now asking citizens to learn to live with the virus by ensuring strict social distancing and hand hygiene.“Our battle with Covid-19 is not over, but we will not be afraid of the virus. We will take all precautions and we are going to move on with our lives,” a tweet by the Press Information Bureau said while releasing a video on lockdown relaxations. “Our analysis shows that people at high risk from Covid-19 are elderly people and those with co-morbidities. One in every two Covid-19 deaths in India has been from the senior citizen population, who constitute 10% of our total population. 73% of Covid-19 deaths have been of people with co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, heart and respiratory diseases,” Agarwal said.The research paper published on medRxiv said that as isolated outbreaks spread across swathes of the country, the government needs to assess its response and preparedness. “Resources must be mobilised to help one cluster of states and then move to the next cluster. It might be useful for the central government and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to classify states in terms of the phases of the epidemic. Even as the worst-hit states are being addressed, the next set could be put on high alert. It is this dynamic policy intervention that will be required to deal effectively with the cascading pattern of the pandemic across Indian states,” it said.Efforts to ramp up testing have also led to a wider detection of cases. About 120,000 samples are being tested for Covid-19 on average every day, with 476 government and 205 private facilities carrying out diagnoses. There are, however, concerns that India could still largely be testing people with symptoms targetedly, leaving scope for the disease to spread undetected.On a question of whether community transmission, when a disease spreads indiscriminately in a population, was underway, the ICMR scientist said: “Instead of using the word community transmission, it is important to understand the extent of spread of the disease and where do we stand in comparison with other countries.” She added that ICMR was conducting a serological survey to assess the extent of the spread of the infectious disease. “Almost 34,000 people are being tested as a part of the survey; the results will be published in a week.”A record single-day spike of 1,298 fresh cases took the Covid-19 tally in Delhi to 22,132 and the death toll mounted to 556. Maharashtra reported 2,287 new cases, taking the tally to 72,300, while fatalities rose to 2,465.States with relatively fewer cases have seen spikes as residents, including migrant workers travelling in special trains, have returned home. UP reported 369 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the tally to 8,729, including 2,404 patients who are migrant workers. Experts say the coming weeks will be crucial and the gains of the lockdown could get undermined if clusters are not contained effectively||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-cases-cross-200-000-rural-clusters-new-challenge/story-3EVw868CBX8xRdoIOdgXjJ.html

However, the covid-19 pandemic has given a fresh life to the drug, which experts have said is complex to manufacture.Gilead Sciences Inc Monday said that its phase 3 clinical trial in hospitalised patients with moderate Covid-19 pneumonia showed that a five-day treatment course of remdesivir resulted in greater clinical improvement as compared to standard care alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dcgi-nod-for-emergency-use-of-remdesivir/story-JJ5156zen4IiiYvgRZaJ0N.html

They said this was the first charge sheet against Bhandari, who had fled to the UK. It sought a non-bailable warrant after filing a charge sheet to enable it to send an extradition request against Bhandari.The Central Bureau of Investigation is also probing Bhandari in a Rs 2,895 crore-deal for 75 Pilatus basic trainer aircraft for the Indian Air Force in 2009. An Interpol red notice is pending against him. The investigation was launched against him when the Income Tax department raided his house in 2016 and found documents pertaining to several properties, apart from several defence documents.Bhandari is also under investigation for allegedly laundering money for properties allegedly linked to Robert Vadra in London, in which NRI businessman CC Thampi was arrested by ED in January this year.Vadra, who was questioned by the ED in May last year, has repeatedly denied all the allegations against him. “Witch-hunt continues for almost a decade,” he told HT last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/enforcement-directorate-files-charge-sheet-against-sanjay-bhandari/story-Tydm7dmPslOouKCQxn8xFK.html
03-06-2020||India||PM Modi speaks to Donald Trump over G7 move||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday endorsed US President Donald Trump’s plan to expand the ambit of the Group of Seven (G7) for its next summit by including countries such as India, saying it was in line with the “emerging realities of the post-Covid world”.Modi made the remarks during a telephone conversation with Trump, according to an Indian government readout of the discussions. Trump spoke about the US presidency of G7, and his “desire to expand the ambit of the grouping beyond the existing membership, to include other important countries including India”. Trump also extended an invitation to Modi to attend the next G7 Summit to be held in the US in September.They also exchanged views on the situation on the India-China border, the Covid-19 situation in their countries and the need for reforms in the World Health Organization, the readout said without giving details.Modi commended Trump for his “creative and far-sighted approach” to the G7 Summit, and acknowledged that “such an expanded forum would be in keeping with the emerging realities of the post-Covid world”. He said India will be “happy to work with the US and other countries to ensure the success of the proposed summit”.On Monday, Trump had spoken to President Vladimir Putin on telephone, two days after he said he would also invite the Russian leader to the G7 Summit. The White House has said the two leaders discussed “progress toward convening the G-7”, and media reports said Trump had extended a personal invitation to Putin for the summit.Trump had told reporters about his plans on May 30. “I don’t feel that as a G7, it properly represents what’s going on in the world. It’s a very outdated group of countries,” he said.Modi had attended last year’s G7 Summit at Biarritz, France, as a special guest for the outreach session at the invitation of President Emmanuel Macron.On Tuesday, Modi expressed concern “regarding the ongoing civil disturbances in the US” and conveyed his best wishes for an early resolution of the situation, the readout said.Trump recalled his visit to India in February, and Modi said it had been “memorable and historic on many accounts” and also added new dynamism to bilateral ties. “The exceptional warmth and candour of the conversation reflected the special nature of the Indo-US ties, as well as the friendship and mutual esteem between both leaders,” the readout said. The conversation between Modi and Trump came four days after India doubled down on its rejection of the US President’s offer to mediate on the standoff with China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-speaks-to-donald-trump-over-g7-move/story-971RdHJTohAHOMkFXkSHoO.html

Since Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s visit to India was in the pipeline (first during January 13-16 and later in May), the two leaders decided to continue their engagement through a virtual meeting.Several agreements, including one on mutual sharing of military logistics facilities, are expected to be signed during the summit on June 4, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.Australia has huge deposits of minerals, including rare earth metals, and the two sides have been working on cooperation in critical and strategic minerals, the people said.The virtual summit will provide an opportunity to the two sides to review the broad framework of the relationship and to discuss their responses to the Covid-19 pandemic.“Due to better understanding of India’s strength and future role, Australia, in its white paper on foreign policy of 2017, recognised India as the pre-eminent maritime power among Indian Ocean countries and a front-rank partner of Australia,” said one of the people.“India and Australia have developed an understanding of each other’s perspectives on regional and global issues. We have a shared approach to a free, open, inclusive, and prosperous Indo-Pacific. This has led to convergence of mutual interest in many areas,” the person added.At the plurilateral level, Australia has backed India’s global initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. Australia also backs India’s membership of an expanded UN Security Council and supported the country’s membership of the Australia Group and Wassenaar Arrangement.“Australia has also been supportive of India’s position on cross-border terrorism and on asking Pakistan to take meaningful action against terrorist groups operating from its soil. Australia co-sponsored the UN Security Council resolution to declare Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar a global terrorist,” the person said.Bilateral trade was worth $20.92 billion during 2018-19, including India exports of goods and services worth $5.17 billion. Australia’s cumulative investment in India is about $10.74 billion while Indian investments in Australia totalled $10.45 billion. The Australian Pension Fund has invested $1 billion in India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund. Australia is home to a 700,000-strong Indian diaspora and there are about 106,000 Indian students in Australia. Under Vande Bharat Mission, 1,560 Indian nationals were repatriated from Australia in seven flights in May. The flights also evacuated 1,096 Australians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-australia-to-boost-defence-and-strategic-ties-during-first-virtual-summit-on-june-4/story-aFeSdZHyNqvK8qBHmHYy5H.html

South Gujarat region is on high alert warning and Saurashtra on alert warning.“13,000 people from coastal areas of Surat, Navsari, Valsad, Dangs and Bharuch in South Gujarat, besides Daman, and Amreli and Bhavnagar districts in Saurashtra region have been shifted to safer locations. Ten NDRF team have been deployed and more five will be deployed across these coastal regions. The rescue teams shifting people to safer places have to be equipped with masks, PPE kits, hand sanitisers, ” said Pankaj Kumar, additional chief secretary (ACS), revenue.Kumar added that we have made shelter homes for people to stay where food and other things will be provided. The shelter homes are well sanitized and social distancing will be followed keeping in mind the current Covid-19 pandemic situation, he said. “We have also made provisions to ensure minimum disruption of electricity. We will ensure that power cut doesn’t affect functioning of Covid-19 Hospitals and power is restored back at the earliest. The district administrations have been asked to prepare a list of Covid patients and arrange temporary Shelter Homes and Covid Hospitals in nearby schools and colleges from now on itself, ” the ACS said.The ACS also said that the market yards and godowns have been advised to move cereals, fruits, vegetables and other farm produces lying in the open to covered sheds. The Gujarat government’s state control room and all the district control rooms have been asked to remain on alert 24x7, he added.Special teams have been deployed that are constantly educating people to stay away from coastal areas and be safe while maintaining social distancing and wearing masks.Gujarat energy minister Saurabh Patel said that all the power distribution companies of the state would be equipped to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity in the entire state. “The power companies of the state are ready to tackle all kinds of difficulties without any problem during cyclone Nisarg. Nodal officers have been appointed by all these subsidiaries to assist in immediate redressal of any ground-level power outage,”said Patel.The energy minister added that all the nodal officers have been asked to give priority in power supply to all feeder power supplies at key locations including hospitals, primary health centres, community health centres, water works, government offices, telecom offices and also to restore power supply on immediate basis in case of any interruption.“Adequate stock of equipment including transformers, conductors, cables, insulators is required in sensitive areas where hurricanes are most likely to be affected have been arranged. Poles are also kept in sufficient numbers to meet any type of emergency where there is a possibility of greater impact of the hurricane,”said Patel. He further informed that teams of 683 contractors with a manpower of about 3,763 have been deployed for the task of repairing any electric pole broken, erecting or requiring electric network.Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani had also hold a meeting of high-power committee meeting on Monday to review the precautionary measures being taken by state and district administration for cyclone forecast likely to hit South Gujarat and Saurashtra regions on June 3.The CM had directed the district collectors to ensure that those living in low-lying areas in these coastal areas, including fishermen, those engaged in prawn farming and salt pan workers, be shifted to safer places by 12.00 noon of Tuesday, June 2.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Monday had said that the low-pressure area formed over the Arabian Sea has intensified into a depression and it will further intensify into a cyclonic storm in the next 36 hours.It warned that the cyclonic storm will cross north Maharashtra and south Gujarat coasts late in the evening on June 3, bringing in its wake heavy rains.“The (low-pressure) system is around 900km away from Surat at present. We expect the cyclonic storm to hit the southern Gujarat coast near Daman on June 3 evening with a wind speed of 90 to 100 km per hour. It will bring heavy rainfall in the south Gujarat region on June 3 and 4. It may have some impact in Bhavnagar and Amreli districts of the Saurashtra region as well,” Director of MET Centre here, Jayanta Sarkar had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-cyclonic-storm-gujarat-government-shifts-13-000-to-safer-places/story-9piVrKdgY3wNDsrxZ1yO7M.html
03-06-2020||India||Cyclone Nisarga: Coastal states try to evacuate people in time of Covid-19||A day before tropical cyclonic storm Nisarga was expected to make landfall just south of Mumbai bringing with it high speed winds and very heavy rainfall, Maharashtra and Gujarat began evacuating thousands of residents of coastal districts, even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured the chief ministers of both states on Tuesday of help from the Centre. The severe cyclonic storm with an expected wind speed ranging from 100-110 kmph (gusting to 120 kmph) is likely to make landfall near Alibag in Raigad district on Wednesday afternoon according to a forecast by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). This comes at a time when both states are already reeling under a high caseload of Covid-19 infections — while Maharashtra recorded 72,300 cases, Gujarat recorded 17,632 cases as on June 2 — raising concerns over the strain it would place on their healthcare infrastructure and municipal resources.While Gujarat had started moving 13,000 people from coastal areas of Surat, Navsari, Valsad, and Bharuch in South Gujarat, besides Daman, and Amreli and Bhavnagar districts in Saurashtra region, Maharashtra had evacuated at least 7,600 people from Palghar, Ratangari and Sindhudurg till Tuesday evening. Another 21,000 are expected to be moved from Palghar and at least 35000 residents of Raigad — where the cyclone is expected to make landfall — will be evacuated, as well. The National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) has deployed 40 teams in Maharashtra, Gujarat and the UT. Five additional NDRF teams from Vishakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh will be airlifted and deployed in Mumbai by Wednesday morning, a senior commander from NDRF said. Officials said the Indian Coast Guard ships, aircraft and on-shore stations are relaying warnings about the impending adverse weather to marine vessels and fishermen. State disaster relief teams have also been activated.According to the IMD, the cyclonic storm is likely to have an impact on Mumbai, Thane and other coastal districts of Maharashtra like Raigad and Palghar. It may hit Valsad, Navsari, Surat, Bhavnagar and Bharuch districts of Gujarat and Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. An alert has been issued for Mumbai city which is already prone to inundation.However officials of both states said that care was being taken to ensure separation of Covid-19 positive cases from others during the evacuation efforts. Anupam Srivastava, NDRF Maharashtra commandant, said each jawan has been provided with a rescuer Covid kit, which includes a hand wash, soap, gloves, face masks and shields. They have also been provided with two biological suits, one which can be disposed of and one which can be washed. “It will be a difficult rescue operation, but we are well-prepared,” Srivastava said.Pankaj Kumar, additional chief secretary (ACS), revenue of Gujarat said that rescue teams were equipped with masks, PPE kits and hand sanitisers. The shelter homes where the evacuees will stay have been sanitized and social distancing norms will be enforced, Kumar added. “We will ensure that power cut doesn’t affect functioning of COVID19 hospitals. The district administrations have been asked to prepare a list of Covid patients and arrange temporary shelter homes and Covid hospitals in nearby schools and colleges,” Kumar said.On Tuesday, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asked citizens to not step out of their houses on Wednesday and Thursday, and ordered establishments, which had opened in the past few days after the lockdown, to stay shut for the following two days.Of the seven districts likely to be affected in Maharashtra, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri have more tehsils at the elevation of just 5 to 15 m above sea level, putting them at greater risk of inundation in the event of very heavy rainfall as predicted. “Guhagar, Dapoli, Mandangad are some of the tehsils expected to be hit most by the cyclone. We have one team of NDRF deployed in the district. We have identified the schools, colleges for the evacuation and have an adequate stock of food grain and other essential commodities,” a district official, who chose to remain anonymous as he is not authorized to speak to the media, said. Most of the district collectors (DC) have imposed curfew in the tehsils expected to be hit of cyclone over next three days.Ratnagiri DC Laxminarayan Mishra said that additional arrangements are being made to separate Covid-19 positive people as well as those under quarantine, during the evacuation.Ganesh Kashnath Lohar, 30, a fisherman who resides 500-metres from the coast close to Mandwa jetty in Alibag was surprised to see four boats and 13 officials of the Maharashra Maritime Board, district collector’s office and NDRF on Tuesday, as they assessed the level of storm surge in the region. “We had only heard about devastating impacts that cyclones had caused in south Konkan but now, based on warnings issued by district officials, we are expecting to witness it first hand,” said Lohar. “My daughter is frightened as if a monster from the sea is going to appear but we have calmed her down telling her it’s just loud thunder and rain. But we ourselves don’t know what to expect after hearing stories from friends how fishermen were affected off the coast of Bengal (during Cyclone Amphan).”Lohar lives with his wife, daughter and mother in a one-room pucca house will not be evacuated — and he is grateful for that. “First it was the lockdown that restricted fishing for almost the entire month of March, and then when we began fishing for just over a month, now a cyclone is coming. There have been a lot of losses for us this year.”With Jaykishan Sharma||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coastal-states-try-to-evacuate-people-in-time-of-covid-19/story-8IXUUyVVpO2ryv1Gybl3RJ.html
03-06-2020||India||Cyclone Nisarga to hit coasts of Gujarat, Maharashtra today||A deep depression over east-central Arabian Sea, which intensified into cyclone Nisarga on Tuesday noon is expected to make landfall as a severe cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 100 to 110 kmph gusting to 120 kmph near Alibag in Raigad district on June 3, the India Metereological Department (IMD) said on Tuesday. Located 94 km from Mumbai, Alibag is a popular seaside resort town for Mumbai’s elite and home to a large fisherfolk community. It started as a warning on Sunday for mid-week heavy rains in Mumbai and by Monday, rapidly developed into a red alert for several coastal districts as the deep depression progressed over the Arabian Sea. As of Tuesday noon, cyclone Nisarga was 280 km west-southwest of Goa, 490 km south-southwest of Mumbai and 710 km south-southwest of Surat . The IMD said that the cyclone was likely to cross north Maharashtra and adjoining south Gujarat coast between Daman and Harihareshwar in Raigad on Wednesday afternoon.The western coastline from Konkan’s Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri to Saurashtra’s Bhavnagar and other districts of Gujarat including Surat and Baruch have received wind warnings ranging from 55-65 kmph (gusting to 75kmph) and increasing to gusting speeds of 115-120kmph in four Maharashtra districts of Palghar, Mumbai, Thane and Raigad. Though a wide expanse of districts stands to be affected across coastal Maharashtra and Gujarat, higher wind speeds in the four districts mentioned above offer an indication of where the cyclone is likely to have maximum impact. “The landfall location will be very close to Alibag but extensive damage can be expected in Mumbai also. For Mumbai, Thane and Raigad there can be storm surge of 1-2 metres and a warning for extremely heavy rainfall has been issued,” M Mohapatra, director general IMD, said. Additional storm surge warnings — shoreward movement of water above astronomical tide height under the action of wind stress — have also been issued for Raigad, Thane, Greater Mumbai and Ratnagiri. Storm surges indicate the extent of inundation to expect. A storm surge of 0.5m to 1.3m over coastal Alibag may result in flooding up to 1.4km of low-lying area. The city of Mumbai and its suburban satellite of Thane, already beleaguered by daily caseload of Covid-19 infections — the capital city breached the 40,000 mark at the start of the week — are in the cyclonic path, leading to concern over whether the city healthcare infrastructure would be able to cope. The IMD sounded a red alert as extremely heavy rains (over 20 cm) are expected in parts of Mumbai, Thane, Raigad, Sindhudurg, and Palghar among other districts.Roxy Mathew Koll, senior scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) Pune, said that if landfall happened over Raigad, maximum rainfall should be expected over areas to its north, where Mumbai falls. “Not just the direct impact of winds but forecast indicates heavy rain up to 200mm while the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services has forecast storm surges with waves of 3-6 metres as the cyclone approaches landfall.If this happens during high tide on June 3 then flooding will be a major concern for a city that is already clogged.”“The last severe cyclonic storm to hit close to Mumbai was in 1961. This storm is severe but with a wind speed of only 100 to 110 kmph. The important thing is to take all precautions possible, which state governments are trying. Inundation is possible so evacuation of vulnerable people is important,” said Mohapatra.But experts warned that devastation can be extensive as today’s Mumbai is very different from the Bombay of 1960’s which has lost most of its floodplains and rivulets and is now counted as among the densest cities in the world. “Where are Mumbai’s floodplains now? Mithi river used to flow then, now it’s a nallah [drain]. Natural defenses like mangroves and rivers have been squeezed out of the city for expanding roads, buildings, and the airport. Hence, when heavy rains lash over a city like Mumbai which has lost its flood plains and defences, the flooding gets prolonged there too,”said Koll.IMD officials said pre-monsoon cyclones like Nisarga were not a rare event, citing the example of very severe cyclone Vayu in June 2019, which was supposed to have made landfall over the Gujarat coastline, but ended up as a low pressure system. “We are observing the increase in pre-monsoon cyclones in Arabian Sea. While we should not draw a trend until observing such weather systems for at least a few years. However, we are assessing whether these systems are intensifying faster than before [which could be] due to numerous factors including rising ocean temperatures,” said Sunitha Devi, in-charge of cyclones at IMD. “Some of the weakest cyclones at sea are being strengthened due to global warming and climate change impacts. This is no more a theory, and is being witnessed every monsoon in Arabian Sea now,” Anjal Prakash, author of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, said.The name, Nisarga proposed by Bangladesh, means ‘nature’. It is the 65th named cyclone in the north Indian Ocean and the second pre-monsoon cyclone to hit the Konkan coast since 1891. It comes in the wake of cyclone Amphan that devastated the lives of over a million people and left 86 dead when it made landfall as a very severe cyclonic storm on May 21 at the Sunderbans, in West Bengal.Skymet, a private weather forecaster differed from the IMD’s prediction of the cyclonic path. “Our weather models are showing the landfall north of Mumbai with crucial period of extremely heavy rain and gale winds expected from Tuesday evening to Wednesday afternoon,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president (meteorology and climate change).//ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-nisarga-on-course-maha-and-guj-on-alert/story-D4YTiW2Z7CpKOn0pagLlQP.html
03-06-2020||India||6,500 Pak nationals among fighters in Afghanistan: UN||There are some 6,500 Pakistani nationals among the foreign terrorists operating in Afghanistan and the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) play a key role in bringing foreign fighters into the war-torn country, according to a UN report.The report, from the UN Security Council’s analytical support and sanctions monitoring team and issued late last month, indicated the Pakistani terrorists formed a significant part of the foreign fighters that pose a serious threat to Afghanistan’s security because of their activities and permanent presence in the country.The report said the Afghan Taliban’s role as a credible counter-terrorism partner for the international community in the aftermath of the February agreement with the US will need careful monitoring because of the “number of foreign terrorist fighters in search of a purpose and livelihood in Afghanistan, including up to 6,500 Pakistanis”.There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials to the UN report.There have been reports since last year of JeM and LeT, both blamed for high-profile attacks in India, sending in hundreds of fighters to Afghanistan following increased pressure from the world community on Pakistan to crack down on terror groups.The UN report said Afghan officials highlighted Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), JeM and LeT among the foreign groups posing a security threat. All three groups have a presence in the eastern Afghan provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, and Nuristan, “where they operate under the umbrella of the Afghan Taliban”, the report said.Afghan interlocutors said JeM and LeT “facilitate the trafficking of terrorist fighters into Afghanistan, who act as advisers, trainers, and specialists in improvised explosive devices”.The report added: “Both groups are responsible for carrying out targeted assassinations against government officials and others. Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-i-Mohammed were stated to have approximately 800 and 200 armed fighters, respectively, co-located with Taliban forces in Mohmand Darah, Dur Baba and Sherzad Districts of Nangarhar Province.”In Kunar province, LeT “retains a further 220 fighters” and JeM “has a further 30, all of whom are dispersed within Taliban forces”, according to the report.The TTP in Afghanistan is led by Noor Wali Mehsud and the group is thought to have about 500 fighters in Kunar and about 180 in Nangarhar.The report also highlighted the close and enduring links between the Afghan Taliban and al-Qaeda despite the signing of the agreement with the US in February. The agreement provided for the drawdown of American troops in exchange for counter-terrorism measures by the Afghan Taliban and intra-Afghan talks aimed at a permanent ceasefire.“Early indications are that many, if not all, of these objectives, will prove challenging,” the report said.The report said the Haqqani Network – a key component of the Afghan Taliban which Indian and Afghan officials have long contended has ties with Pakistan’s military establishment – continues to be close to al-Qaeda. It added that al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri met members of the Haqqani Network as recently as February.The report also highlighted the presence of Pakistani terrorists in the Islamic State’s Khorasan chapter, such as commander Abdullah Orakzai alias Aslam Farooqi, who was captured with 21 others in Kandahar in March. Twelve Pakistani nationals were captured along with Farooqi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-500-pak-nationals-among-fighters-in-afghanistan-un/story-ebw8kdoFAVW4vTu7KyS40M.html
03-06-2020||India||Supreme Court stays order on Navlakha||The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed a Delhi high court order in which it had on May 27 criticized the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for “whisking away” activist Gautam Navlakha from Delhi to Mumbai even as his interim bail was pending before it.The high court had directed the investigating officer to produce the entire set of records filed before NIA courts in Mumbai and Delhi for obtaining a production warrant and for extension of Navlakha’s judicial remand and fixed the matter for hearing next on June 3.NIA moved the apex court against the order. A bench of Justices Arun Mishra, S Abdul Nazeer, and Indira Banerjee directed the stay and sought response of Navlakha on NIA’s plea by June 15 when the case will be heard next.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who represented NIA, said that the high court has no territorial jurisdiction to call for records. He added the petition pending before it related to interim bail which was not maintainable. Mehta told the apex court that NIA did not act in haste while moving Navlakha to Mumbai. He said Navlakha surrendered in Delhi on April 14 but could not be moved to Mumbai due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Mehta added Navlakha was moved only after necessary permission was obtained from the NIA court in Mumbai.Navlakha and other activists face charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for their alleged links with the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist). They are accused of making inflammatory speeches at an event on December 31, 2017, that allegedly triggered violence in Bhima-Koregaon near Pune.NIA argued since cases under UAPA are tried by special courts, even bail applications will have to be filed before them. It added even the jurisdictional court to approach for interim bail will be the Bombay and not the Delhi high court.The high court on May 27 pulled up NIA for “whisking away” Navlakha from Delhi’s Tihar Jail on a production warrant issued by a special judge in Mumbai, where he is lodged at Taloja Jail.“The NIA has acted in unseemly haste to instead remove the applicant out of the very jurisdiction of this court; and, if the applicant is right, without even informing the Special Judge (NIA), Mumbai or the Special Judge (NIA), Delhi of the pendency of the present proceedings.”EXPERT COMMENT, ANY REACTIONS||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-stays-order-on-navlaha/story-urQIXfMjgmgFZ1rnP0qdRP.html

Earlier, the senior Congress leader was arrested by the CBI in August, 2019.Currently both of them are out on bail.ED has alleged earlier during court hearings that “for FIPB approval, Peter and Indrani Mukerjea (then owners of INX) met P Chidambaram so that there was no hold up or delay in their application. P Chidambaram asked for his son’s business interests to be kept in mind. ED identified payments of Rs 3.09 crore by Peter Mukerjea to ASCPL (Advantage Strategic Consultancy Pvt Ltd) and associated entities controlled by Karti P Chidambaram through manipulated debit notes.”“During investigation, it was admitted that debit notes were raised on the directions of Karti Chidambaram to show some transaction which in fact did not occur,” the agency has alleged. It said the money so received by associated entities was channelled back into ASCPL.“The funds received by ASCPL were invested and ASCPL also purchased shares of Vasan Health Care. A part of these shares was sold at a profit of nearly Rs 41 crore. ASCPL also earned Rs.18.49 crore from sale of shares in another company for an amount of Rs 29.49 crore. These funds arising from sale of laundered property is also property involved in money laundering,” it has claimed.The agency had, in February 2019, attached properties worth Rs 54 crore allegedly belonging to Karti in Spain, the UK and India.Indrani Mukherjea, in her statement to CBI, has claimed that US dollars 5 million and US dollars 4,50,000 were transferred in overseas account of Congress leader in 2007 and 2009 respectively after getting money from INX’s foreign investors while a cash payment of Rs 1 crore was made to Karti in Delhi in 2009.

03-06-2020||India||Jessica Lal murder: Manu Sharma free after 21 years||Manu Sharma, who was serving a life term after being convicted of the murder of model Jessica Lal in 1999, was released from Tihar jail on Monday evening. His release, along with that of 18 other convicts, was approved by lieutenant governor (LG) Anil Baijal. Confirming the release, Sharma’s lawyer Amit Sahni said the lieutenant governor had accepted the recommendations of the sentence review board, which met on May 11. A spokesperson from the L-G’s office said the sentence review board recommended Sharma’s release without any disagreement, and that the L-G concurred with the recommendations approved by state home minister Satyendar Jain.Any convict -- barring one found guilty of heinous crimes such as rape and murder, murder and robbery, murder in cases of terrorism and murder while out on parole -- who has completed 14 years in prison is eligible for early release. Sharma has served around 16 years of actual sentencing. According to jail records, with time earned for good conduct (remission), he has completed 23 years.The prison’s director-general Sandeep Goel confirmed that Sharma was released on Monday. Since 2018, , Sharma was lodged in the open jail of the prison. Open jail prisoners are allowed to step out for work but have to return in the evening and spend the night inside the prison complex. They are housed in flats within the prison complex. HT first reported this development on April 22, 2018, and that it was possibly the penultimate step towards his release.In November 2019, Sahni, Sharma’s advocate, approached the Delhi high court seeking his release. In his plea, he had said that despite spending 23 years in jail (with remission added), and a record of good conduct in prison, the sentence review board denied his client’s release on four separate occasions in an “unfair and unlawful manner”.The Delhi high court then asked the board to consider Sharma’s case for release in its next meeting, which took place on May 11. The seven-member board consists of the state home minister as its chairman, the prison’s director-general, state home secretary, state law secretary, a district judge, the government’s chief probationary officer, and a joint commissioner-rank officer of Delhi Police.Siddharth Vashishta,43, better known by his alias Manu Sharma, shot dead model Jessica Lal, who was tending an unlicensed bar at a private party on April 30, 1999, after she refused to serve him a drink well past midnight. He is the son of Haryana politician Venod Sharma.Last month, after SRB recommended Sharma’s release to the lieutenant governor, Lal’s sister Sabrina said that she had forgiven Sharma and that he had served his time for the crime. Sabrina Lal also said that it was time for her to move on. “My fight was always for justice. We got justice. If he is released. I have no problem,” she said. When contacted on Tuesday, Lal said: “The past is behind me. Our fight was always for justice. I just hope that pray that he is a reformed man and learned his lesson.” Sharma’s acquittal by a city court in February 2006 triggered protests across the country, after which the Delhi high court took up the case. The high court reversed the lower court’s order, saying it ignored or misread material evidence. Sharma was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in December 2006. The Supreme Court upheld the order in 2010.Prison officials said Sharma’s work inside the prison helped his case for release. He runs an NGO, Siddhartha Vashishta Charitable Trust, that started working in Tihar around eight years ago, and has funded the education of the children of prison inmates. His non-profit has also worked towards the rehabilitation of families of underprivileged prisoners. Sunil Gupta, who was the prison’s legal officer for 35 years and who knew Sharma inside prison, said Sharma’s good conduct good work helped pave the way for his early release. “I interacted with him many times during my years in prison. He helped the jail factory in branding its products and made it famous. It was his idea to open outlets or sell the products on the web. His NGO also focused on the children of prisoners and helped hundreds of families,” Gupta said.Gupta also added that had Sharma not been a “high-profile prisoner” he may have been released just after completing 14 years in prison. ”His remarkable work in prison was lauded by everyone. Also one must remember that a prison is a reformation centre. It is not a place to lock anyone forever.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jessica-lal-murder-manu-sharma-free-after-21-years/story-tTFOtgOgusiMRFcsZIPAmI.html
03-06-2020||India||Assam landslides leave 20 dead; 8k displaced people taken to camps||At least 20 people, including three children, were killed and several others injured in landslides triggered by heavy rain in the three districts of Assam’s Barak Valley on Tuesday.“Six persons were killed in Karimganj and seven each in Hailakandi and Cachar districts of the region in separate incidents,” said Assam forest minister Parimal Suklabaidya, who visited the districts.Following instructions from Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, Rs 4 lakh each was being given to families of the victims.Seven persons were killed in Joyour area of Cachar district in a massive landslide that buried their house. Two persons who were seriously injured have been admitted in Silchar Medical College Hospital.“Seven persons died in a landslide in Bolor Bazaar area of Mohonpur in Hailakandi district in the early hours of Tuesday. The landslide took place due to incessant rainfall in the area over the past three days,” said a Hailakandi district information department official, requesting anonymity.Besides the 20 deaths because of landslides on Tuesday, nine people had drowned in Assam until Monday in the first spate of floods that affected 11 districts. Nearly 8,000 displaced people have been sheltered in relief camps.Officials said the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) personnel have rushed to the three landslide sites.Sonowal condoled the loss of lives in the landslides. “Deeply anguished at the loss of lives due to landslides triggered by incessant rain in Barak valley. I have directed Cachar, Hailakandi & Karimganj district administrations and SDRF to step up rescue, relief operations and facilitate all possible help needed to those affected,” he said in a tweet.Suklavaidya, who was in Hailakandi town to review the Covid-19 pandemic situation, has directed district authorities to immediately send their reports on the landslide to the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-landslides-leave-20-dead-8k-displaced-people-taken-to-camps/story-8wBVz2OH0wOYJeCl8RXfmK.html
03-06-2020||India||Assam gas well blowout puts biodiversity at risk||The blowout of an Oil India Limited (OIL) gas well in Assam’s Tinsukia district last week is causing extensive damage to biodiversity and wildlife the region -- including the endangered hoolock gibbons and Gangetic dolphins -- according to several residents, activists and experts.Baghjan, where the gas well blowout occurred on May 27 is close to the Dibru Saikhowa National Park, the Maguri-Motapung wetlands, and the forest villages of Barekuri which are habitat to the hoolock gibbon.Uncontrollable gas flow is continuing from the gas well, according a press statement issued by Oil India Limited on Monday.“What we are seeing is complete horror. Condensed oil is leaking continuously. The Maguri-Motapung wetlands (an important bird and biodiversity area) is very badly affected. There is a thick layer of crude oil on the water. Fish are dying and some cattle that graze in the adjacent wetlands are also dead,” said Mridupaban Phukon, a student and wildlife activist.“We have been informed by people in Barekuri villages that condensed oil is coating leaves and has started affecting the hoolock gibbon habitat. If not contained immediately the wetlands and national park will be devastated,” he said over phone.Around 650 families have been evacuated from the affected areas and continue camped in three relief camps.“I visited the area on Sunday but it was barricaded. I could see the damage everywhere. Dead fish were floating and the vegetation is brown now. One Gangetic dolphin died soon after the leak. Usually the Maguri bheel is rich with birdlife, I could hardly spot any birds that day. I appeal for immediate help,” said Nabamita Ray, doctor and wildlife enthusiast.AM Singh, principal chief conservator of forests, Assam and spokesperson of environment ministry said that a team of forest officials, pollution control board members and OIL officials will submit a report on Wednesday while another committee which also has independent members from IIT Guwahati are assessing damage in the national park.Oil India’s crisis management team (CMT) members have started pumping water through the casing valve. “Water is being pumped continuously through the valve into the well head. Oil India has also contacted global experts to control the blowout,” the press statement cited above said, adding that the water pumps are being installed in the nearby river (source of water) and pipeline-laying work is in progress. Officials said that an additional plot of land adjacent to the well site has also been arranged to create a big reservoir of water and to place the well control equipment in it. A blowout is the uncontrolled release of crude oil or natural gas from an oil well or gas well after pressure control systems have failed. According to Oil India, the blowout happened on May 27 while operations were going to produce gas from a new sand (oil and gas-bearing reservoir) at a depth of 3,279 metres. The well was until then producing around 100,000 standard cubic metres a day of gas. Assam Chief Wildlife Warden and additional principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF) MK Yadava said an assessment is underway to measure the damage to the ecology and animal and bird species in the area because of the blowout. He added that the carcass of a Gangetic dolphin found at Maguri beel has been sent for forensic examination.“In the two days after the accident, the condense oil had only spread up to 500 metres but now it has spread in 1.5km radius as per our observations. Oil India is saying it may take another week. Who will compensate for this damage?” asked Hemanta Moran, Principal, Jatiya Vidyalaya Baghjan.According to a 2013 site inspection report regarding oil and gas pipelines in Upper Assam by conservation scientists and former members of National Board for Wildlife, MD Madhusudan and Prerna Singh Bindra, the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park and Biosphere Reserve meet at the confluence of the Brahmaputra with three of India’s easternmost rivers—the Siang, Dibang and Lohit rivers. The park shaped by the these rivers is spread over 765 sq-km, of which 340 sq-km form the core and is a complex of wetlands, alluvial grasslands, riverine forests, swamps and semi-evergreen forests, including the largest willow swamp forest in north-east India.Dibru-Saikhowa has recorded over 40 mammals, 500 species of birds, 104 fish species, 105 butterfly species and 680 types of plants. It harbours tigers, elephants, wild buffalos, leopards, hoolock gibbons, capped langurs, slow lorises, Gangetic dolphins, besides critically endangered bird species such as the Bengal florican, white-winged duck, greater adjutant stork, white-rumped vulture, slender-billed vulture, and the very rare and endemic black-breasted parrotbill.Meanwhile, an OIL advertisement last month said the union environment ministry has accorded environmental clearance on May 11 for extension drilling and testing of hydrocarbons at 7 locations under Dibru Saikhowa National Park. HT verified documents on environment ministry’s Parivesh website which also states that the clearance was accorded.“The continued oil leakage from the blow it is a horrific environmental crime. It has caused the death of the endangered Gangetic dolphin and thousands of fish, laying wetlands and fields waste, it is endangering the rare hoolock gibbons. Unfortunately, this is not the first time there has been such a leakage or environmental norms have been flouted –indeed part of the pipeline in the eco-sensitive zone of the Dibru-Saikhowa National park had been laid before mandatory environment approvals were given. Dibru-Saikhowa and its surrounding landscape has immense ecological values, and allowing drilling inside a national park is against the spirit and letter of the law, besides violating our basic constitutional principles of protecting environment,” said Bindra, who visited the site as a National Board for Wildlife member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-gas-well-blowout-puts-biodiversity-at-risk/story-2vC9dFDWMqMRC5d22HEuHN.html
03-06-2020||India||Centre looks to simplify laws, decriminalise minor offences||The Narendra Modi government plans to undertake a wide-ranging review of existing laws and decriminalize many” minor” offences, especially if there are alternative processes to deal with them, as it seeks to promote ease of doing business and decongest the justice system, according to senior functionaries aware of the development.The government has been making a concerted effort to simplify the laws and increase the efficiency of the criminal justice system. As part of the exercise, the Modi government is seeking to embark on an exercise to decriminalize criminal offences that are deemed to be minor.According to a person with knowledge of the of development, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba has on Monday instructed the secretaries of Union ministries and departments to undertake a “comprehensive review” of all the legislations under their purview to identify provisions that need to be decriminalized or wherein the punishment should be rationalised.Gauba has told the secretaries that the exercise is aimed at decriminalizing minor offences with the aim of ensuring speedy resolution through compounding, a process that entails an entity accepting that it has committed an offence and seeks to be condoned.The move is aimed at preventing harassment of citizens, declogging the criminal justice system and also to promote ease of doing business.Ministries have been asked to hold consultations with all stakeholders on laws which they believe can be decriminalized. The cabinet secretary, the top civil servant, has suggested that the exercise be completed within one month. The government policy think-tank, NITI Aayog, would also be providing support to different ministries to conduct the exercise, said the person cited above.Gauba, it is learnt, has suggested that the secretary who is the top official in any ministry, supervise the entire exercise.The deliberations that various ministries hold will be shared with a committee of secretaries that will take decisions on which laws need to be decriminalised.The ministries have been asked to provide a list of laws wherein penal provisions exist that can be decriminalized. The ministries have also been asked to provide timelines for carrying out the exercise.Demands have been voiced by various quarters to decriminalize Acts including those related to running businesses, copyrights, defamation and other offences. It is only after a ministry suggests the decriminalizing of a particular provision that the process can be taken forward. The government has in the past worked to decriminalize certain provisions under the Companies Act in an effort to promote the ease of doing business.In March, the Union cabinet cleared 72 amendments to the Companies Act, 2013, decriminalizing various offences and moderating the penalty regime to boost of ease doing business.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters that the proposed changes will make the Companies Act, 2013 “more humane”.Sitharaman said a ministerial panel had looked into how many sections in the Companies Act caused businesses worries. “We suggested 72 changes to 65 sections in the Companies Act, 2013. In this set of amendments, the priority is to decriminalise the Act. Majority of the changes are to remove criminality of the offences where no mala fide is intended. The major thrust is to improve the ease of doing business and to decriminalise the law,” the minister said.Veteran bureaucrat and former I&B Union secretary Uday Kumar Varma said as time passes and circumstances change it is important to have a new look at the laws and their provisions.“Revisiting old laws is a very necessary phenomenon. No law is static. Perhaps, what is being proposed is to ratioinalise many provisions of the law and bring about better synchronization. This process seems a natural and desirable process. This is also a requirement for ease of doing business and for economic development. Ease of doing business is desirable as long as it does not come at the cost of any section or puts national interest in jeopardy. However, in this case, prima facie, to me this seems a natural exercise,” Varma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-looks-to-simplify-laws-decriminalise-minor-offences/story-EgXlfcJ8inxeiuXJ3zaIcP.html
03-06-2020||India||India’s Covid-19 tally crosses 2-lakh mark; 1 lakh new cases detected in 15 days||The nationwide tally of confirmed Covid-19 cases crossed the 2-lakh mark on Tuesday with almost one lakh people testing positive for the dreaded virus infection in the last 15 days. The government, however, said its preventive measures to contain the disease have been very effective, as shown by a much lower fatality rate than several other countries. Authorities also said the recovery rate of Covid-19 patients was improving consistently in India and it was in a much better position in handling the pandemic, which has seen more than 63 lakh people testing positive for this virus since its emergence in China last December and over 3.7 lakh having lost their lives. In its morning update, the Union Health Ministry said the novel coronavirus death toll has risen to 5,598 in India with 204 more fatalities in 24 hours since Monday 8 AM, while 8,171 new cases were detected during this period to take the overall tally to 1,98, 706. This included more than 97,500 active cases, while more than 95,000 have recovered. However, a PTI tally of figures announced by different states and union territories as of 10.05 PM showed the cumulative count of confirmed Covid-19 cases having risen to 2,00,321 and the death toll of 5,739. It also showed a higher count of recoveries at 99,613, leaving nearly 95,000 active cases across the country. A real-time global coronavirus tracker of Johns Hopkins University & Medicine showed India’s tally of positive cases at 2,01,997 as of 10.15 PM. India’s first Covid-19 case was detected in Kerala on January 30, while the tally took 110 days to reach the one-lakh mark on May 18. However, close to one lakh new cases have been detected in 15 days since then. On the positive side, this is the first time in seven days that the count of new cases has come down, while the 24-hour death toll also came down considerably from 230 recorded by the Union Health Ministry on Monday morning -- the second-highest after an all-time high of 265 deaths recorded on May 30th morning. Testing infrastructure has also been ramped up considerably in India in the recent months with an average of 1.2 lakh tests being conducted every day now. So far, close to 40 lakh tests have been conducted in India, putting it among the top-five nations globally on this parameter alongside the US, Russia, UK and Spain. However, India does not figure even among the top-100 countries when it comes to tests per one lakh population. At present, India is the world’s seventh worst hit nation in terms of overall case count, after the US, Brazil, Russia, the UK, Spain and Italy. While more than 18 lakh cases have been detected in the US so far, Brazil has over 5 lakh cases and Russia has over 4 lakh. The UK tally is nearly 2,8 lakh cases, followed by close to 2.4 lakh in Spain and about 2.3 lakh in Italy. In terms of the death toll, the US tops the global tally with more than 1.05 lakh fatalities, while India does not figure among the top-ten countries on this parameter. More than 27 lakh have recovered so far across the world, with the US again topping this chart with nearly 4.6 lakh recoveries, followed by Brazil, Russia, Germany, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Iran, India and China in the top-ten. In terms of active cases, India figures among the top-five nations, while the US again is on the top with more than 11 lakh active cases. The government said India is far away from the peak of Covid-19 spread and its preventive measures have been “very effective”, putting it in a much better position in comparison with other countries. Addressing a press conference on the Covid-19 situation, Joint Secretary in the Health Ministry Lav Agarwal said it is wrong to just look at the total number of cases and state that India has the seventh highest number of cases as the population of countries also should be taken into account. About 14 countries with a cumulative population almost equal to that of India have reported 55.2 times more Covid-19 deaths, he said. “Our Covid-19 fatality rate of 2.82 per cent and amongst the lowest in the world, compared to a global fatality rate of 6.13 per cent. We have been able to achieve this due to timely identification of cases and proper clinical management,” Agarwal said. He also said that India’s Covid-19 case fatality rate per lakh population is 0.41 per cent as against 4.9 per cent globally which is also amongst the lowest in the world. Agarwal said one in every two Covid-19 deaths in India has been of senior citizens who constitute 10 per cent of the total population, while 73 per cent of Covid-19 deaths in the country are of people with comorbidities. Asked if India has entered the community transmission phase, Indian Council of Medical Research scientist Nivedita Gupta, who was also present at the briefing, said, “Instead of using the word community transmission, it is important to understand the extent of spread of the disease and where do we stand in comparison with other countries.” When asked when the peak will arrive, Gupta said, “We are very far away from the peak. Our preventive measures to curtail the disease are very effective and we are better positioned in comparison with other countries. You will get to see the data in a week.” She also said there was no under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths in India. There has been a continuous mismatch in the data made public by the central government and the tallies announced by some states and union territories for deaths as well as confirmed cases. Several states and UTs, including Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Ladakh and Puducherry reported rising number of cases on Tuesday. Many of the states, including those in the North-East, reported new cases linked to people having returned from outside. In Tripura, a 50-year-old woman allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself from the ceiling of a toilet in an Agartala hospital, a day after her swab sample was tested for Covid-19. The police suspects she had developed a fear of contracting the disease and may have committed suicide out of panic. Her test came positive for the novel coronavirus, hours after she had already died. In Maharashtra, the worst-hit state, a four-month-old baby girl also tested positive for Covid-19 in Amravati district. The state reported 2,287 new cases, taking its overall tally to 72,300, while fatalities rose to 2,465 after 103 more patients succumbed to the infection, the state health department said. On the positive side, as many as 1,225 patients were discharged from hospitals during the day, taking the state’s count of recovered cases to 31,333. Gujarat, another badly hit state, reported 415 new cases and 29 deaths, taking the overall case count to 17,632 and fatalities to 1,092, the state health department said. A total of 1,114 Covid-19 patients were discharged from hospitals during the day, taking the tally of the recovered cases to 11,894, it said. In the national capital, at least 13 employees of the Delhi Lt Governor Anil Baijal’s office and six other government officials tested positive for Covid-19, sources said. These included junior assistants, drivers and peons. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal launched an app named ‘Delhi Corona’ that will give information to patients about the availability of beds in private and government hospitals. He said cases are increasing in the national capital, but sufficient arrangements have been made for ventilators and beds in hospitals. “We are several steps ahead of coronavirus,” the chief minister said. West Bengal registered its highest single-day spike of 396 cases, taking its tally to 5,772. Kerala also recorded its highest single-day spike of 86 positive cases, taking the state’s tally of Covid-19 cases to 1,412. Besides, a 77-year-old priest died at the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College Hospital, taking the death toll to 11. Uttarakhand also saw its tally crossing the 1,000-mark after 85 more people tested positive. Five Covid-19 positive family members of the state’s tourism minister Satpal Maharaj were readmitted to a hospital within hours of being discharged from the facility. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, said India will definitely get back its economic growth and reforms undertaken during the lockdown will help the economy in the long run. His comments came a day after global rating agency Moody’s downgraded India’s credit rating to just a notch above the junk status on growth concerns. “On the one hand we have taken tough steps to fight the virus and on the other, we have taken care of the economy... We have to save the lives of citizens while also stabilise the economy and speed up growth,” Modi said while addressing top industry body CII’s annual session. A comprehensive review of various studies, published in the renowned Lancet journal, in the meantime said that physical distancing of two metres or more can prevent person-to-person transmission of Covid-19. It also found that face masks and eye protection may decrease the risk of infection too. The systematic review of existing evidence was commissioned by the World Health Organization, the researchers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-19-tally-crosses-2-lakh-mark-1-lakh-new-cases-detected-in-15-days/story-X07se93XQqyLZ6K2ZytDMK.html
03-06-2020||India||Indian Army matched Chinese troop build-up at LAC: Rajnath Singh||In the first official acknowledgement of a troop build-up along the disputed border with China, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said a significant number of Chinese troops were present along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and the Indian Army had matched the neighbour’s military moves. This came on a day the two sides met again to ease the tensions. “Achchhi khaasi sankhya mein Cheen ke log bhi aa gaye hain lekin Bharat ne bhi apni taraf se jo kuch bhi karna chahiye…kiya hai. (Chinese soldiers are there in large numbers (on the LAC) but India has also done what it had to,” Singh told a news channel when asked to comment on the ground situation along the border. Singh’s comments came against the backdrop of silence on the issue from the external affairs ministry. The defence minister said differing perceptions of the LAC had led to the standoff, and talks were on at the diplomatic and military levels to break the stalemate.Singh told CNN-News 18 that a meeting between senior Indian and Chinese military officials would take place on June 6 to discuss the border situation. Meanwhile, Indian and Chinese officials, led by major generals, met on Tuesday to ease border tensions but there was no breakthrough, officials said. This was the third meeting between two-star ranked officers.China has marshalled close to 5,000 soldiers and deployed tanks and artillery guns on its side of the disputed border in the Ladakh sector where India has also sent military reinforcements and matched the neighbour’s military moves, as reported by Hindustan Times on May 26.Northern Army commander Lieutenant General YK Joshi on Tuesday visited Leh, the headquarters of 14 Corps in Ladakh, for a security review of the sensitive sector at a time when Indian and Chinese soldiers are eyeball-to-eyeball at four locations along the LAC.Several rounds of talks between local military commanders have failed to end the standoff that began with a violent confrontation between rival patrols near Pangong Tso four weeks ago.Around 250 soldiers from the two countries clashed near Pangong Tso on the night of May 5-6 with the scuffle leaving scores of troops injured. While an immediate flare-up was avoided as both armies stuck to protocols to resolve the situation, tensions swiftly spread to other pockets along the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-matched-chinese-troop-build-up-at-lac-rajnath/story-Snp0wjGg49dnF2zszCW93K.html
03-06-2020||India||2m distancing, masks key to stopping Covid-19 spread: Study||Keeping two metres away from others, and wearing face masks and eye protection, both in and outside hospitals, are the most effective ways of stopping the spread of Covid-19, according to the most comprehensive study to date on the transmission of the contagious pathogen.But none of these interventions, even when properly used and combined, offer complete protection from infection, and other protective measures such as hand hygiene are needed to reduce the spread of the disease, according to a review of 172 studies from 16 countries published in the highly cited journal, The Lancet, on June 2.“Based on the available evidence on physical distancing, face masks, eye protection and hand-washing, we cannot say which one is best at this point. They are all effective, but the combination of those interventions it likely better than any of the interventions alone,” said study co-lead Professor Holger Schünemann, department of Health Research Methods, Evidence and Impact at McMaster University in Canada, on email.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe study found that the risk of infection was 2.6% when people stand more than a metre away from the infected people, against 12.8% risk if they were within a metre, with modelling suggesting that the risk halved for every extra metre, up to three metres. Masks and protective eye coverings also added protective benefits, though the evidence for that was less clear cut, said the analysis, which was part-funded by the World Health Organization (WHO). The chance of infection was 3.1% for those wearing a face mask, and 17.4% for those without, while using face shields and glasses reduced the risk of transmission to 5.5%, down from 16% without use. “There is not a real difference between a cloth mask and a face covering like a bandana. We did not specifically look at these masks but they may protect spreading Covid-19 from the person wearing it. N-95, medical or surgical masks, and 12-16 layer cotton masks provide protection, based on the data we found,” said Professor Schünemann, who co-authored the review of studies on how physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection affect the spread of three diseases caused by coronaviruses -- Covid-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (Mers).“[The study authors] also report that respirators and multilayer masks are more protective than are single layer masks. This finding is vital to inform the proliferation of home-­made cloth mask designs, many of which are single­-layered. A well designed cloth mask should have water-­resistant fabric, multiple layers, and good facial fit… Universal face mask use might enable safe lifting of restrictions in communities seeking to resume normal activities and could protect people in crowded public settings and within households,” said Professor Raina MacIntyre from the Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales in Australia, in an accompanying comment. She was not involved in the study.With the pandemic yet to peak in India according to several experts, clinicians say protective behaviours are critical to stop the spread. “The only way we can decrease the number of cases from spiking is by aggressive isolation, a lot of community participation in terms of very strict wearing of masks, social distancing and frequent hand-washing. I would say, we literally need policing of masks and other social distancing behaviours to enforce compliance, whether you are in office, whether you are travelling, whether you are out, to prevent a spike in numbers,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).The current evidence suggests that Covid-19 is most commonly spread by respiratory droplets, especially when people cough and sneeze, entering through the eyes, nose, and mouth, either directly or by touching a contaminated surface, but there is increasing concern about the extent of transmission through aerosols, which are tiny saliva and vapour droplets suspended in air in some settings.“The current evidence on aerosol spread of Covid-19 is not conclusive – there are studies supporting easier aerosolisation and those that suggest it is aerosolised only in the context of procedures in the hospital,” said Professor Schünemann, referring to his study on the risk of Covid-19 transmission to health workers in ICUs through aerosol-generating procedures such as non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation. The study was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on May 22.The new study, which was conducted to inform WHO guidance documents, has immediate implications for preventing current and future waves of the pandemic by informing disease models, and standardising the definition of who has been “potentially exposed” for contact tracing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/social-distancing-masks-eye-wear-and-hand-washing-work-best-in-combination-study/story-yROOhsGvHO0Zp7eAZpJmjJ.html
03-06-2020||India||North-East states report a sharp rise in coronavirus cases||There has been a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases in the northeast with the region reporting over 2,100 infections until Tuesday. Assam, the most populous of the region’s seven states, has reported the bulk of these cases (1,514). The other six less populous states have also recorded a significant increase in the cases over the last few days and officials have called easing of interstate movement since last month the prime factor for the jump.The region reported the first Covid-19 case on March 24 when a 23-year-old woman tested positive in Manipur after her return from the UK. The region had reported 103 cases until May 5.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOn Tuesday, Assam’s tally was 1,514, which included 1,365 patients, who have returned to the state since May 4.“The surge in positive cases is because of the homecoming of our residents from other states. Nearly 800 of the new cases are of those who returned from Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Delhi,” Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Sunday.Tripura recorded the highest single-day spike on Monday when 107 people were diagnosed with the disease and took the state’s tally to 421 cases. It rose to 444 on Tuesday and included 166 Border Security Force personnel and their family members. Until May 5, the state had 42 cases.In a tweet on Tuesday, Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga said of the 12 new cases in the state, 10 had returned from Delhi and two from Kolkata. The state had recorded just one case prior to that. A 50-year-old pastor diagnosed with the disease in Mizoram on March 24 was discharged from a hospital following his recovery on May 9.Nagaland reported six new cases on Tuesday and with this, the state’s tally went up to 49. The first Covid-19 cases in the state were detected on May 25 when three persons returned from Chennai and were found to be infected.Meghalaya had 13 cases until May 5, all of them connected to one family in Shillong. Two weeks later, one person who returned from Chennai tested positive.

03-06-2020||India||198 migrant workers died in road accidents since Mar 25: Report||One hundred and ninety eight migrant workers lost their lives in road crashes during the lockdown from March 25 to May 31 imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to data compiled by the SaveLIFE Foundation, a non-government organisation that promotes road safety .At least 1,461 road crashes took place over the course of the nationwide lockdown in which at least 750 people were killed, including the 198 migrant workers headed home. Some 1,390 persons were reported injured in the crashes, according to the data. On average, 1,200 road accidents happen in India every day, and around 400 people lose their lives on account of them, according to the transport ministry. However, the restrictions during lockdown took most vehicles off the roads.Migrant workers killed during their return home comprise 26.4% of the overall deaths during the lockdown; essential workers made up 5.3% of the total deaths. And 68.3% of the overall deaths involved other road users, including pedestrians, two-wheeler and three-wheeler drivers in cases “involving over-speeding, hit and run and distracted driving etc,” the report said.While migrants used all means at their disposal to get back home during the lockdown -- they couldn’t use public transport because there was none till May 1 when special trains for migrant workers were launched -- essential workers were up and about performing their duties; they were the only people allowed to move around for much of the lockdown. The report attributed the road crashes to fatigue among bus and truck drivers hired to transport the migrants, combined with over-speeding and poor roads. Uttar Pradesh accounted for over 30% (245) of the total deaths followed by Telangana (56), Madhya Pradesh (56), Bihar (43), Punjab (38) and Maharashtra (36).The five states that reported the most road crash deaths of migrant workers were Uttar Pradesh (94), Madhya Pradesh (38), Bihar (16), Telangana (11) and Maharashtra (9).The report said the data has been compiled using media-tracking and multi-source verification. “With COVID 19 still very much around, we simply can’t afford to burden our already over-burdened healthcare system with road crash related trauma. It is critical that States enhance enforcement to prevent road crashes and the citizens inculcate essential safety habits for the road like they did for personal hygiene during the lockdown,” said Piyush Tewari, founder and CEO, SaveLIFE Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/198-migrant-workers-died-in-road-accidents-since-mar-25-report/story-WnIIgmaHkO0nO7zAEJv1fI.html
03-06-2020||India||Fewer Covid deaths in India: Health ministry||Fewer people are dying in India of Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) compared to the rest of the word, with India’s current case fatality rate at 2.82% compared to the global average of 6.13%, according to data released by the ministry of health and family welfare on Tuesday.People above 60 years of age,who make up 10% of the country’s population, account for 50% of the 5,598 Covid-19 deaths recorded in India. Of these, 38% belong to the 60 and 74 years age group. Patients who were aged above 75 years old account for 12% of the deaths, the data shows. The data that the ministry released on April 30 showed 34.8% deaths were recorded in 45- 60 year age group. “There is enough data being generated that people who are elderly (above 60 years of age), and those who suffer from some kind of underlying medical condition such as hypertension, diabetes or respiratory illness are at high risk and need to be extra careful as they are at a higher risk of developing severe form of disease,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry, at a press briefing.According to the health ministry’s analysis of the deaths, 73% of the Covid deaths are of patients with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular and respiratory disease. “This section of population needs to keep their symptoms under control by taking regular medicines, consulting their doctor on time, taking preventive measures such as not stepping out of the house, if not necessary, and wearing a mask, following hand hygiene etc.,” Agarwal added. In terms of deaths per 100,000 population, India has fatality rate 0.41 as opposed to 4.9 globally.“India’s death rate is probably the lowest in the world, and that is enough to speak for how the country has managed its cases far better than some of the most developed countries in the world. Also, India’s case fatality rate has been steadily declining since past two months. In mid April it was around 3.3%, then it dropped to 3.25%, later to 3.15%, and as on today we stand at 2.82%, even then we can’t let our guard drop, and taking precautions must be turned into a habit,” Agarwal said.“If you look at individual countries, some countries have even reported as high as 82 deaths per lakh population. This says how our focus on early case detection, and robust contact tracing in containment zones has been in the right direction, and it will continue to be our main strategy in future also, along with ramping up the Covid testing capacity,” Agarwal added.Experts say focusing on the elderly and people suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is important as this section is more vulnerable to Covid-19.“People with major NCDs need regular care, and are likely to develop severe form of illness because of their co-morbid conditions, which is why we are working on reference guidelines for patients, doctors and other support staff to look for ways to reduce morbidity and mortality among this group, ” says Dr Prashant Mathur, director, The National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (NCDIR). India’s daily Covid testing capacity at the moment is about 140,000 samples; and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is aiming to scale it up to about 200,000 samples a day in the next two weeks.“In past two months our focus has been to scale up testing, and we have managed to go from about a 100 labs in March to about 681 functional laboratories currently, of which 476 are government labs and 205 are private testing labs. Around the end of March we were doing about 20-25,000 samples in a day in India, and for the past few days the number on average is about 1.20 lakh samples a day,” said Dr Nivedita Gupta, scientist (epidemiology division), ICMR.“There was shortage of supplies felt when we started out testing for Covid because there was a global demand for these supplies. Today, we have managed to handhold many indigenous manufacturers who are capable producing kits in bulk. We also use RT-PCR testing kits of at least 11-12 domestic manufacturers for testing, making us far more comfortable in terms of testing huge numbers in a short span of time than we were a few months ago,” she said.RT-PCR is short for Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction, known as the gold standard among Covid-19 tests.One of the private lab owners, on condition of anonymity, said, “It’s good to encourage indigenous manufacturers; however, we have to also ensure quality of products such as testing kits, swab sticks, viral transport medium that is being manufactured domestically. If the quality isn’t maintained then people will keep going for imported products.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fewer-covid-deaths-in-india-health-ministry/story-0SKS4yVeiqqYHHiTb98CHM.html

Thus far, 5.7 million stranded migrants have been ferried back home in 4,155 trains.Rail minister Piyush Goyal has said the trains will be operated till the demand from the states remain. On Sunday, the Railways operated only 69 Shramik trains. On Tuesday only 102 Shramik trains operated till 10 am, officials said. “The demand for trains has reduced and only a very few trains are running as mostly all stranded migrants have been sent. The operation may soon be over,”a rail ministry official said on condition of anonymity. The trains were launched on May 1. Western railways on Tuesday said only two shramik trains operated from Mumbai Suburban area. Western railways has operated1,214 Shramik Trains thus far ferrying18,23,826 passengers to their desired destinations, it said.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageTill Monday, the national carrier received a request for only 321 more trains from various states.The railway board chairman wrote to states on May 29 asking states to provide details of migrants still wanting to return and provide their demands for trains to the ministry.Railway board chairman, Vinod Kumar Yadav  in a press conference last week had said the demand for these trains is declining from the originating state.Nearly 1,524 Shramik Specials were operated from May 22 to May 28 and ferried two million passengers. On May 20, as many as 279 trains ran.Last week, originating states asked for 923 trains for migrants, but the number stood at 450 as of last Thursday, he said adding that the trains will continue to run as long as states will request.The maximum number of trains have been received by Uttar Pradesh and Bihar followed by Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal.The top five States from where trains originated are Gujarat(1027 Trains), Maharashtra(802 Trains), Punjab(416 Trains), Uttar Pradesh (288 Trains) and Bihar (294 Trains).aND THE top five states where trains terminated are Uttar Pradesh(1670 Trains), Bihar(1482 Trains), Jharkhand(194 Trains), Odisha (180 Trains), West Bengal (135 Trains).Several Shramik trains from May 20 till May 24 were diverted due to route congestion. The railway ministry said 71 trains were diverted during the period. “It may be noted that trains running now are not facing any congestion. In addition to Shramik specials, railways are running 15 pairs of special Rajdhani type trains connecting New Delhi and started 200 more time tabled trains on June 1,” the ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/demand-for-shramik-trains-sees-a-decline/story-ACVJ8xwXZo00Le5QzJFj1J.html
03-06-2020||India||Social security ID for migrants on top of labour panel’s agenda||A portable social security number for migrant workers and other employees in the vast unorganized sector will be the main issue on the agenda of Parliament’s labour committee when it meets on June 5 to review the social security codeThe standing committee on labour, in the backdrop of the misery confronted by unorganized sector workers in the past two months in the aftermath of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, will also push the government to provide a larger social security net that can help them tide over the difficult situation.“We have seen what is happening to the hapless migrant workers and other daily wagers after the pandemic swept across the states. The welfare of the unorganized sector is the biggest issue for us,” said Bhartruhari Mahtab, chairman of the labour standing committee.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe unique social security number, which would be linked to the Aadhaar unique identity number, is expected to automatically identify unorganized sector workers and help the government roll out targeted doles or welfare schemes for them in a more organized way. Aadhaar cannot be used to distinguish unorganized sector workers. The focus on the unorganized sector, particularly daily wagers, in the social security code comes months after the standing committee on labour asked for sweeping changes in the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2019 (OSH Code) in favour of vulnerable workers. According to government officials, at least 50 amendments to the OSH code proposed by the House panel will be accepted to benefit migrant workers.The social security code aims to register every unorganised worker who is at least 16 years of age. The bill also aims to ensure that “every eligible unorganised worker under sub-section shall be registered by such registering authority by assigning a distinguishable number to his application or by linking the application to the Aadhaar number.”The bill also envisages that “a registered unorganised worker shall be eligible to avail the benefit of a scheme framed under this Chapter on making such contribution, if any, as may be specified in the scheme.”The panel is set to push the government for a larger social security cover for the unorganized sector that forms 93% of India’s workforce.“For the organized sector, there is protection available in the form of EPFO or ESI. They can also avail pension plans. But there’s not for unorganized sector. We need to take a different approach for them,” said another member of the panel, requesting anonymity.EPFO is short for the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation, the government’s retirement savings manager, and ESI stands for Employees’ State Insurance The Narendra Modi government launched three schemes— old age pensions, disability pensions and life insurance for the unorganized sector -- but they are contributory schemes wherein the beneficiaries have to make small monthly or yearly contributions.The labour panel may pitch for a larger social scheme without voluntary contributions to be added in the social security code. Welfare schemes, according to two members of the panel, must take into account a situation such as the Covid-19 pandemic when millions of daily wagers can be out of work for months at a stretch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/social-security-id-for-migrants-on-top-of-labour-panel-s-agenda/story-YwyFjHQgrorT0bxKB1qIlI.html
03-06-2020||India||Telangana presents alarming picture of Covid-19 with 58 deaths, 1,230 positive cases in two weeks||Telangana has been witnessing a rapid rise in the number of Covid-19 deaths and positive cases in the last 15 days, raising an alarm in the state.On Tuesday, the state reported four deaths and 99 positive cases, taking the total number of deaths to 92 and the positive cases to 2,891.The death toll was 34 on May 18, when most restrictions on people’s movement were removed with lockdown 4.0 coming into force, which led to 58 more casualties in a span of just 15 days.Similarly, the total number of positive cases in the state went up from 1,661 cases on May 18 to 2,891 on Tuesday, a steep rise of 1,230 cases. In the last four days alone, the number of positive cases has shot up by 466 and deaths by 21.According to the official bulletin released by the state medical and health department, out of 99 new positive cases reported on Tuesday, 87 are local residents and the remaining 12 are migrant labourers returning from other states. Of the local cases, 70 are from Greater Hyderabad municipal corporation limits and seven are from adjacent Ranga Reddy district.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The four deaths reported on Tuesday include a 42-yr old man with pre-existing cardiac problem, a 41-year old man with Thyroid disorder and two women, a 70-yr old and a 60-year old, both suffering from hypertension.According to director of medical and health G Srinivasa Rao, the steep rise in the number of deaths and positive cases after the relaxations in lockdown since May 18 were mainly due to the increased movement of people from one place to another.“People are travelling across the state and some of them are not following the basic preventive measures like wearing a mask, maintaining safe physical distancing and avoiding crowding. This has resulted in a surge in the cases,” he said.He added that a large number of migrants returning from states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar etc were being put in home quarantine by the district authorities to break the chain of transmissions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-presents-alarming-picture-of-covid-19-with-58-deaths-1-230-positive-cases-in-two-weeks/story-qpyJFmeKuNjC1CkzMRHe5K.html
03-06-2020||India||Proposed Electricity Bill is against federal spirit, KCR tells PM Modi||Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Tuesday strongly opposed the Centre’s proposed bill to amend the Electricity Act which he said would have an adverse impact directly on the management of the state electricity utilities.In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the backdrop of the Centre asking the states to express their opinion on the draft Electricity Amendment Bill, 2020, KCR demanded that the Centre should withdraw the proposed Bill.He said the proposed bill would take away certain functions and powers of the State government. Proposals like appointment of State Electricity Regulatory Commission by a selection committee constituted by the Centre and entrusting the responsibilities to a neighbouring State Electricity Regulatory Commissions under certain circumstances were against the federal spirit.“Just because power is a concurrent subject, it does not mean that the Centre or Parliament can enact laws which have direct and major influence on the functioning of the state government,” he said.The chief minister also said any national renewable energy policy should be formulated with the consent of the states, not just consultation. Each state has its own unique situations like potential for hydro power, wind power, solar power, land availability etc. As such, states should have the flexibility to determine their own policy on renewable energy, he said.He also opposed making the national load despatch centre (NLDC) all powerful with regard to scheduling of power throughout the country. It will result in backing down of state thermal units, which cannot compete with central stations whose generation cost is less. “Therefore, intra-state transmission decisions should be left to the SLDCs only,” he said.The draft bill also has a provision for the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) of subsidy provided to consumers, particularly to the agriculture and domestic sectors. This would work against the interest of farmers and very poor domestic consumers. Mode of payment of the subsidy should be left to the state government, KCR argued.The Telangana chief minister resisted the proposal that the Commission will fix the tariff for all the consumers without any subsidy. Presently tariff fixation by the Commission includes some cross subsidy to be borne by certain categories of consumers.“With the proposed amendment, bills are to be issued for actual cost to all the categories of consumers including agriculture. Discretion to levy cross subsidy on certain sections of consumers shall be better left to the states,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/proposed-electricity-bill-is-against-federal-spirit-kcr-tells-pm-modi/story-xLQvqIj9mi3uqNArPAKjvJ.html

Only three IndiGo flights will fly out of Mumbai on Wednesday.“Due to severe cyclonic storm currently moving towards the country’s western coasts, IndiGo has cancelled 17 flights to and from Mumbai. IndiGo will only operate three flights from Mumbai on June 03, 2020:6E 495 Mumbai- Chandigarh 6E 6179 Mumbai - Ranchi6E 5373 Mumbai – Patna,” the airline said in a press statement on Tuesday. It said it has offered an alternate travel plan to its customers.“All the passengers of the affected domestic flights are being notified. At IndiGo, we are customer centric and have empowered our customers by offering PLAN B, sent to each individual, an option of re-booking on alternate flight starting next day or to protect PNR as credit account,” it said.The Met office has warned that the cyclonic storm will have a maximum sustained wind speed of 100-110 kmph gusting to 120 kmph.Ahead of the cyclone’s landfall, rain lashed Mumbai on Tuesday evening. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray who addressed the people through social media in the evening, appealed to citizens to stay indoors on Wednesday and Thursday.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said it was taking all precautions including relocating people from unsafe localities to ensure that there is no casualty when the storm hits Mumbai.

03-06-2020||Editorials||The importance of the MGNREGS||The nationwide lockdown, which was imposed to control the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), sparked an exodus of migrant labourers from their host states to home states. Many of them do not have any safety net such as agricultural land or savings to see them through this difficult patch. This has led to a huge spike in the demand for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). According to The Indian Express, close to 22 million households utilised the demand-driven scheme in May, the highest for the month in the last eight years. At least 19 states and Union territories have reported an increase in the number of households provided employment in May. Unsurprisingly, the leading migrant-sending states saw the highest increase in demand in the month, with Uttar Pradesh at the top, followed by West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha.The Centre did well in hiking the allocation of the programme by Rs 40,000 crore, taking the total allocation under the scheme to Rs 1,01,500 crore. The return of migrant labourers and popularity of the scheme is probably an opportune moment for the government to tweak MGNREGS, as a column in this newspaper suggested. What if the government decided to allow employment of MGNREGS workers in private agricultural activities? This will lead to a significant reduction in cost of cultivation by easing or even eradicating the cost of hired labour, and also enhance its capacity to employ more people, in addition to the present goal of using it as a mechanism to prevent economic distress and build rural assets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-importance-of-the-mgnregs/story-9npYzKgyDshMQM4QlcHErL.html
03-06-2020||Editorials||The Delhi-DC-Beijing triangle||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and United States (US) President Donald Trump took the opportunity of the latter inviting India to the planned Group of Seven plus summit to discuss the situation at the India-China border on Tuesday. The conversation raises a question of how New Delhi should use geopolitical cards when playing yet another round of shotgun poker with Beijing. Of their own volition, US officials have been vocal in calling out China during this crisis, conflating Beijing’s border intrusions with its strangulation of the South China Sea and Hong Kong. This may please Indians, but an overt US role in a bilateral dispute may not necessarily make things easier for India. New Delhi should not define strategic autonomy to be the external relations of a hermit. Statecraft is about increasing options, not reducing them. Dealing with China, a country cognizant of its much greater heft, means all possible diplomatic, economic and military means need to be brought to bear. One measure of a nation’s strength is how many friends it has, and being able to say one of them is the US still counts for a lot. Beijing sees Washington as its only peer; so, bringing the US into a dispute can be useful. In a number of past cases, whether border negotiations in the 1980s or forcing China to stop stapling visas for Indian Kashmiris, India has used its proximity to the US to its advantage. In the instance of the Doklam stand-off, it worked better to keep the US at a distance. At the same time, an India which handles such crises on its own builds capacity within its institutions and polity. Resilience based on domestic strengths, independent of the international environment, is the best means to deter troublesome neighbours. Also, disputes over a dozen kilometres of barren land are small enough; entangling them in superpower rivalry will not make resolution easier. India’s interests now range from the local to the global, and, so, a part of its skillset must be to judge when to use a scalpel and when, a broadsword. An emerging power must recognise which external crises can be handled at what level. At present, Galwan Valley is best handled at the bilateral level with the US’ support being used only as background noise. There are other long-term issues regarding China, in areas such as technology standards and maritime security, which can be taken up at venues like the supersized G-7 summit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-delhi-dc-beijing-triangle/story-HOoJIOMkEn1kwyBqx3wQBM.html
03-06-2020||Editorials||After Amphan, Nisarga sounds a warning bell||The developing severe tropical cyclonic storm in the Arabian Sea — Cyclone Nisarga — is expected to make landfall in Raigad district, south of Mumbai, by Wednesday afternoon, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. The IMD has sounded a red alert for June 3 and 4 in Mumbai and Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts. Like Amphan, which battered West Bengal and Odisha last month, Nisarga is expected to submerge low-lying areas, uproot trees, destroy uncemented houses and critical infrastructure, and worse, kill people and animals. The aftermath of the storm will be challenging too. Nisarga comes at a time when Maharashtra is already in the grip of the coronavirus pandemic, and there is severe strain on the health care system and personnel. Both Amphan and Nisarga are trailers of what the future is going to look like for India’s eastern and western coastlines, thanks to the climate crisis. The climate crisis is making these cyclones stronger and more destructive by increasing the sea surface temperature and rainfall during the storm; raising sea levels, which increases the distance that a storm surge can reach; and allowing storms to gain strength quickly. Indian cities need to adapt quickly to this new reality. A top-down climate adaptation and resilience policy will not suffice; the climate crisis will need micro-level planning and adaptation and resilience plans. To do this, city governments must be politically and financially empowered; and have adequate personnel who understand the climate crisis. On their part, government departments must stop working in silos; to develop a long-term resilience strategy, they need to work together because the climate crisis affects all sectors. For centuries, cities have been centres of commerce, culture and innovation. They must now develop the ability, the capacity, and the will to take on the climate crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/after-amphan-nisarga-sounds-a-warning-bell/story-Bhbctpo3Jsmiye3CJZo7IN.html
03-06-2020||Editorials||Covid-19: Crossing 200,000 cases||India now has over 200,000 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). It is now the seventh most affected country in the world. The only silver lining is that India’s fatality rate at less than 3% is among the lowest of the severely affected countries, which means that while the infection is spreading, it is not leading to as many deaths as elsewhere. While this is a health advantage India must sustain and build on, the situation is worrying.India crossed 100,000 cases on May 18 and the doubling rate is about 15 days. If this persists, it means that by the middle of June, India may be close to 400,000 cases; by the first week of July, it could cross a million cases. This also means that if the current fatality rate stays static, India may witness close to 30,000 deaths from the disease by early July. While this may be low in relation to other countries, it still represents a staggeringly high loss of precious Indian lives within a period of four months since the disease started spreading in India. Now, take into account the fact that through May, the lockdown was still in force, albeit with greater relaxations in the last fortnight of the month. The country has now substantially opened up, which, all experts agree, could lead to a sharp increase in cases.This also means that India is clearly in the stage of community transmission, notwithstanding the government’s inexplicable denial of it. The surge in cases will make the process of contact tracing — integral to the treatment protocol and in ensuring that the rate of transmission is limited — far more difficult. It will also strain the health infrastructure. There is no easy solution. But both governments and citizens need to be better prepared. Authorities, both at the central and state levels, will have to ramp up testing, be rigorous with tracing, find more hospitals and beds, and continue to focus on keeping fatalities low. Citizens will have to exercise great care when they step out, maintain social distancing norms, wear masks, and avoid all unnecessary activities. Remember that Unlock 1.0 is not freedom from the disease. Prepare for a difficult month ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/crossing-200-000-cases/story-jIGdqprUUMCqjg1UwjNkbI.html
