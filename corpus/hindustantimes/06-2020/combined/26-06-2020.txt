26-06-2020||News||Domestic constraints will impinge on the China policy |Opinion||Neither the proposition that both India and China have enough space to grow nor the attempt to foster a close personal understanding between the top leaders of the two nations, can obscure the reality that the latter is India’s greatest strategic threat. The challenge is compounded by its nexus with Pakistan. Its recent move to establish new facts on the ground along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is only the latest manifestation of its innate hostility.The public grief and anger at the loss of 20 Indian Army personnel in the Galwan Valley are not easy to assuage. But this should not lead to emotion governing policy choices. Rather, the country’s political and security classes have to introspect calmly on the continuing validity of the basic postulates of India’s China policy set in place by late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1988 and pursued by every government since. This demands, above all, to use a cricketing analogy, avoiding a domestic political spin and the adoption of Rahul Dravid’s careful rock-solid play, confidently conservative, never defensive.Besides the China factor, there are domestic economic, social and political realities that impinge on India’s current external engagements which merit hard-headed examination. The economic expansion over the past two decades and, consequently, the emergence of a substantial market with growing potential contributed to the rise of the country’s global standing. Covid-19 has disrupted and damaged the economy, which had already slowed down prior to the outbreak. Notwithstanding the desire of some global businesses to look seriously at India as they decide to move part of their operations out of China, questions will inevitably arise about India’s immediate and mid-term future. These will increase and lead to doubts if perceptions arise of the weakening of the country’s social fabric and the cohesion of its political class.Indian foreign policy managers will necessarily have to take into account the present and anticipate future global perceptions about India. They will also have to assess the resources available for the implementation of foreign policy objectives. Their analysis on both fronts can neither be based on exuberant expectations nor on pessimism. The watch words have to be balance and caution combined with trust in the nation’s resilience in charting the course.While the pandemic has exposed governance lapses, social faultlines and the economic frailties of all countries, it will lead to a focus on models of development pursued by emerging and poor countries. India, too, cannot escape scrutiny in this. Inevitably, comparisons will be drawn on how India has dealt with the situation as compared with other emerging economies, especially China. In this context, only the most knowledgeable foreign observers will make allowances for India’s size and diversity and the complexities of its quasi-federal polity and consequent administrative constraints.There is little doubt that many external groups, especially the Delhi-based diplomatic community, would have followed developments relating to the migrant labour situation, the administrative failure to foresee their movement, the initial confusion, and the spectacle of thousands taking to the highways. This could not have drawn much appreciation. This would have been so even while some gratitude was expressed for medical supplies to many countries and keeping up with international engagements.What the international community will now observe are the corrective measures, and how quickly they are put in place to mitigate the impact on health and revive the economy. The Narendra Modi government has announced a slew of reforms. This is positive and forward-looking, and will create a measure of confidence of India’s determination to address the situation on many economic fronts. However, the government’s focus on self-reliance needs to be placed in the context of the valid aspiration for an increased manufacturing base, including in hi-tech areas. This is because the term is associated with an earlier time and with a radically different ideological development model.In this troubling background, Indian decision-makers will have to primarily focus on the core aspects of engagements. This must necessarily begin with South Asia where China is chipping away at Indian interests. India’s attempts at greater integration of this region need to be invigorated, coupled with the message that it will not accept any compromise of its security interests. No fresh initiatives with Pakistan are needed until it overcomes its paroxysms of outrage consequent to changes in Jammu and Kashmir last year. The approach to Afghanistan needs an injection of realism with regard to the Taliban.Other core areas that need attention are the upgradation of the relationship with the United States, cultivating affinities with democratic countries in the Indo-Pacific region, and maintaining a balanced approach towards West Asia. India’s diplomatic energies need to remain focused on these, and not get diffused at a time when the primary area of concern has inevitably got to be domestic — the management of perhaps the greatest challenge independent India has faced arising from the coronavirus pandemic.

26-06-2020||News||On China, the Indian government needs to communicate better||It could take the next few weeks, maybe even months, to resolve (or not) the border stand-off with the Chinese in eastern Ladakh. This gives the government another chance at adopting a clearer strategic communications strategy. Over the last two months, if there is one lesson that should leap out at those who manage the messaging of the Narendra Modi government, it is this: Throwing a veil of secrecy over what’s happening on the ground in the upper reaches of the Himalayas has only led to the proliferation of rumours, fake news, WhatsApp memes and often, a last-laugh advantage to our adversary. Yes, every serious journalist understands that operational details cannot and must not be disclosed. And yes, every serious journalist who follows the military would have cultivated enough sources to ferret out an approximate version of how events unfolded. But that has not prevented multiple contradictions, denials and obfuscations at the official level. And tragically, it has led to the smearing and slandering of military veterans who have dared to express scepticism or ask tough questions. I witnessed this information clampdown first-hand in Ladakh after spending four days at ground zero. Returning 21 years after the Kargil conflict, which I had the privilege to report from the frontline, the contrast could not have been more glaring. News teams were allowed to go no further than the city limits, and even within that, the headquarters of the 14 Corps was off-limits. Journalists could gaze up at the clear blue skies to see fighters and Apaches break the silence of the town every 15 minutes. But the road to Galwan was blocked 300 kilometres from the last accessible point on the Leh-Manali road. Restrictions on physical movement may still make sense, of course, but to not brief, even on background, reporters present on the ground — and to not allow the military to do so either — is self-defeating. Think of Kargil, a pre-live telecast war, fought before there were mobile phones and satellite vans in Jammu and Kashmir. There was no notion of the journalist embedded with the military then in India. We were a handful of young reporters ready to take risks. But, even in the middle of an ongoing war, right at the frontline, we were allowed to meet and talk with soldiers and briefed regularly on what we could say, show and not say. Back in Delhi, officials of the external affairs ministry and the Indian Army joined hands to host daily afternoon briefings. General Bikram Singh, who went on to become the Chief of the Army Staff and Raminder Jassal, the fine, ever-smiling diplomat who never flinched from a single question, became the face of those televised interactions. The result — the news media became a force multiplier for India’s interests. There was an unprecedented outpouring of solidarity for the soldiers. The country stood united against Pakistan. And there was a singular narrative to the Kargil story. This time, the government first chose not to share the fact of the Chinese transgression with the public. Then, when 20 of our men died in the line of duty, fighting close to 300 troops of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), what followed, in terms of communication, was a classic lesson in what not to do in times of a sensitive military challenge. Prime Minister (PM) Modi’s own comments at the all-party meeting had to be clarified. Even the clarification took a day. By that time, the Chinese had waded into the swamp of information chaos. Even today, we have only dribs and drabs of information, often contradictory, on what is happening with the Chinese in sensitive areas such as Pangong Tso and the Depsang plains. In Ladakh, villagers from the border areas like Durbuk and Shyok told me, “Where our horses used to once go for pasture, we now see the Chinese.” The head of the Ladakh Buddhist Association, PT Kunzang, an admirer of the PM, told me that people in Leh hoped for the “same response in Ladakh as the government had after Pulwama. If we don’t act strongly now, the Chinese may be sitting right here in Leh next.” Those who understand mountain warfare know that drawing parallels with Pulwama is easier said than done. As Colonel Sonam Wangchuk, a hero of the 1999 war, who ousted the Pakistanis from a vertical peak of 18,000 feet, told me, “To militarily oust the Chinese from the heights would need the wherewithal of war. You can’t do this with small arms. You need artillery, maybe even artillery as direct firing.”No one is advocating war. But to manage expectations, sentiments and above all the Chinese, you need a cohesive, coherent, real-time strategic communication model. To lose the information war is to let down our soldiers who are fighting on the actual battlefield.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/on-china-the-indian-government-needs-to-communicate-better/story-S5W5xrFBzySj1KtgKmB2JP.html
26-06-2020||Mumbai||HC allows MMRDA to start work on Metro line-6 in Andheri||In a reprieve for Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), the Bombay high court (HC) on Friday allowed the authority to begin work on Metro line 6 at Swami Samarth Nagar in Andheri, which falls in coastal regulation zone-1 (CRZ).No mangrove destruction is contemplated in construction of Metro line 6 at Swami Samarth Nagar, as the proposed construction of 26 piers in CRZ-1 are to be constructed on the median of already existing Beek Road.MMRDA was, however, compelled to move high court seeking specific permission for carrying the work in CRZ-1 area because the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) had imposed a specific condition of obtaining HC permission for starting the work.In the petition filed through advocate Saket Mone, MMRDA stated that it could not start work on the Metro line as part of the work at Swami Samarth Nagar was affected by a 50-metre mangrove buffer zone.Acting on public interest litigation filed by city NGO, Bombay Environmental Action Group, the high court has issued a series of directives in October 2005 for protection of mangroves along the coastline. As part of the measures, the court has prohibited constriction in mangrove areas and has also directed planning authorities to keep the area of 50 meters surrounding mangroves as a buffer zone where no developmental activity could be carried out.The division bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice Madhav Jamdar also allowed MMRDA to construct compound walls in 50-metre mangrove buffer zones at Turbhe and Mandale on Metro line 2B, which connects DN Nagar in Andheri to Mandale in the eastern suburbs. According to Mone, construction of this compound walls is part of the Metro project and is necessary to protect mangroves in the area.Metro line 2B is a 23.6 km corridor which connects DN Nagar in Andheri West to Mandale in eastern suburbs, whereas 14.5 km Metro line 6 connects Swami Samarth Nagar in Andheri to Vikhroli on the Central line.The bench allowed MMRDA’s plea on the ground that both the corridors are important parts of the 310-km long Metro network, being developed in Mumbai Metropolitan Region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-allows-mmrda-to-start-work-on-metro-line-6-in-andheri/story-HaNL7OXsDS7XabtkJUrDFL.html
26-06-2020||Mumbai||Congress slams PM Modi on India-China clash||Terming the India-China clash in Ladakh a failure of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government, the state Congress on Friday slammed the Centre and Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi and sought clarification on the recent reports about the structures erected by China on Indian land in Galwan Valley.Congress leaders also demanded reduction of the central excise duty on diesel and petrol, pointing out that it was burdening common man who is already distressed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The Maharashtra unit of the party observed ‘Shahidon Ko Salaam Divas’ on Friday and has planned a statewide protest on June 29. After paying tribute to the 20 martyred soldiers during the India-China clash last week, state Congress president Balasaheb Thorat and senior party leader and former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan addressed a press conference. Thorat said the Modi government has completely failed to safeguard the Indian territory. “China has been taking advantage of the PM’s statement made during the all-party meeting that China has not intruded on Indian territory. They have been citing our PM’s statement on international level to claim that they have not entered the Indian territory. The Congress does not approve of the statement, although we have vowed to stand by the government in this bitter tussle. The PM is expected to react responsibly on such an important issue. His statement was contrary to the stands taken by the defence and external affairs ministries,” said Chavan.Chavan also demanded reduction in the excise duty levied on petrol and diesel by the central government. BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said, “Before asking any questions on India-China clash, the Congress should clarify how much Indian land was infiltrated by China from 2004 to 2014.” Bhandari said the Maharashtra government, in which the Congress is a ruling partner, should first remove the surcharge of ₹3 a litre levied on petrol and diesel recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/congress-slams-pm-modi-on-india-china-clash/story-o1ekIJXti2TUxeHfWfdvML.html

In its letter, the group also said that residents may deposit the remaining 50% of their monthly bills after September, when the pandemic is likely to be over.“We demand that consumers are allowed to deposit only 50% of electricity bill for the period of April 20 to September 20, and that the rest should be added in the following months (October or November), keeping in mind that there has been a loss of jobs and other financial issues. Nobody can restart normal operations due to restrictions, thereby facing financial woes. We are not demanding any waiver,” said Alok Singh, founder member of ACT and a resident of Sector Alpha-1.There are at least 1.5 lakh power customers in Greater Noida and 3.5 lakh in Noida. “Residents have been finding it hard to manage daily expenses, and a reduction in amount to be deposited would give them some respite. We are hopeful that positive action would be taken in this regard, as Gautam Budh Nagar in particular has been facing huge crisis due to Covid-19 outbreak,” said Harinder Bhati, a member of the team and resident of Beta-1.In Noida also, some residents have supported this demand. “It is a tough time. The government must look into the demand raised by the Greater Noida residents,” said Deepkia Singh, a resident of Sector 61, Noida.PVVNL officials said that the payment of bills has been affected due to the outbreak. “Only the government can take a decision on this demand of residents,” said VN Singh, chief engineer of PVVNL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-crisis-greater-noida-residents-ask-govt-to-allow-to-pay-50-of-power-bills/story-mGbeGcY0ygr16SX2dJWjEI.html
26-06-2020||City||Delhi: HC equates teachers with corona warriors, pulls up north body over salaries||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Friday pulled up the North Delhi Municipal Corporation over non-payment of salaries to teachers who are also deployed on Covid-19 duty, while stating that it is a “sorry state of affairs” where the teachers, who can be equated to corona warriors, have not been paid salaries since the lockdown was imposed.Taking strong note of the non-payment of salaries to the safai karamcharis and the teachers, a bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad took suo moto cognizance of the issue and converted it into a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) which would be listed before Chief justice DN Patel on June 30.The high court’s order comes on a plea by the Akhil Dilli Prathmik Shikshak Sangh, representing teachers who are teaching in the north corporation’s schools, challenging a June 9 order by a single judge which had dismissed their plea, to direct the civic body to release their salaries that have not been paid since March 2020.“This is a sorry state of affairs. Teachers belong to one of the noble professions and as they are made to do Covid-19 duty also, they can be equated to Covid-19 warriors. Despite that, they have been deprived of their dues since March 2020,” the bench said.On Friday, the court was informed by the counsels for the north corp that there are 700 schools under the jurisdiction of the civic body and 9,000 teachers. However, only 3,500 teachers had been deployed on Covid duties on a rotational basis, which the facilities continued till mid-June.As of now, there are 90 dry ration distribution centres being operated from the north body’s schools with approximately 800 teachers engaged in duties there. The liability for the release of salaries of these 3,500 teachers, who were involved in Covid-19 duties, is approximately Rs 25 crores per month.In a status report, the civic body said that the Delhi government, instead of implementing the fourth Delhi Finance Commission (DFC), implemented the 5th DFC from April 1, 2016 in the year 2019. It said that the Delhi government has still not implemented the recommendations of the 4th DFC, despite categorical directions by various orders. It further said that the Delhi government is liable to pay Rs 968.97 crore under 4th DFC from April 2012 to March 31, 2016. The municipal corporation added that they do not have funds to disburse salaries even for teachers.However, the Delhi government, in its report, said they have already released Rs 49.17 crore for teachers’ salaries for April 2020. Funds for salaries for the month of May have also been sanctioned, the state government said, adding that the payments are being made monthly instead of on a quarterly basis due to the pandemic.Expressing displeasure, the bench said, “It is deemed appropriate to convert this petition into a suo motu petition… The Delhi government is directed to file an affidavit responding to the averments made by the North DMC within one week. List before the roster bench for appropriate order on June 30,” the bench said.It noted that payments to the teachers for the month of March were paid only this morning, after the court directed the corporation to pay the salaries on June 18.The matter would be now heard on June 30.ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-hc-equates-teachers-with-corona-warriors-pulls-up-north-body-over-salaries/story-jGQxjbVt4Jp06tNT2uzz4O.html

The notification proposes post-facto approvals for projects and does away with public consultations in some instances, till the Covid-19 lockdown subsists. It was published in the official gazette on April 11 and invited objections or suggestions contained in the draft EIA notification within 60 days.On May 7, the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, in a press release, said it extended the period up to June 30.Conservationist and founder of Social Action For Forests & Environment (SAFE) Vikrant Tongad contended before the high court that this ought to be extended till September 30 or till such time that the restrictions induced by Covid-19 remain.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan, issuing the notice, said, “Take an approach which is fair to everyone.” and posted the matter for June 29. It also asked the Centre to come up with a resolution if there was any ambiguity and not merely issue a corrigendum.“This draft notification proposes significant changes to the existing regime, including removing public consultation entirely in certain instances, reducing the time for public consultation from 45 days to 40 days, and allowing post facto approvals for projects,” the plea had said.Reacting to the plea, secretary, Union environment ministry, R P Gupta said, “We have received thousands of responses on the draft EIA 2020 notification. The public has been given over 75 days time already to respond. We don’t intend to extend the time for comments or responses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/significant-change-to-eia-on-the-cards-plea-requests-extension-for-public-comments/story-Bho4Of8eZrd9z1kyKCqKIL.html

26-06-2020||City||To improve contact tracing, Gautam Budh Nagar admin to form 200 more teams||NOIDA: Amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Gautam Budh Nagar, the district administration has decided to increase the number of health department teams from 600 to 800 to handle the crisis more efficiently. It is being done to improve contact tracing and door-to-door screening of residents across the district, said officials.“We will form 800 teams, which will work in different areas, including containment zone, to handle Covid-19 issues. These teams will also monitor the delivery of essential goods in containment zones so that residents get the supply at door step. Also, we will circulate leaflets in villages and sectors to make people aware about the safety precautions,” said Narendra Bhooshan, Greater Noida authority’s chief executive officer, who is also the nodal officer for Covid-19 preparations in GB Nagar.According to the officials, apart from contact tracing and door-to-door survey in villages and sectors, the 800 teams -- each having two members from the health department -- will also be engaged in the task of enforcing health department guidelines and supplying of essential goods in containment zones. In containment zones, the health staff will identify people in three categories -- elderly people, persons with comorbidities like cancer and heart problem, and those with influenza like illness (ILI). Bhooshan has directed the health department and other departments concerned to improve the surveillance in containment zones and carry out deep sanitization in such zones properly to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The district currently has a total of 282 containment zones, as per the latest data from the administration. “We have directed the incident commanders to put a board outside the house, where a positive case is detected. If no new positive case is detected in a containment zone within 14 days, then the restrictions should be removed immediately so that people do not face any problem,” said Bhooshan.There are five different zones -- Noida, Greater Noida, Dadri, Jewar and Sadar Tehsil -- in the GB Nagar district and each zone is taken care of by an incident commander. At Noida and Greater Noida’s urban areas, city magistrates are incident commanders, while in Jewar, Dadri and Sadar Tehsil areas, SDMs are incident commanders. The administration has also appealed to people to follow social distancing norms strictly. “A person should come out of his/her house only if it is necessary, wear mask, gloves and wash hands properly. A person must maintain two-yard distance from other person to stay safe from infection,” said Bhooshan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/to-improve-contact-tracing-gautam-budh-nagar-admin-to-form-200-more-teams/story-madMZ7DJF9FhbDNFVvND7K.html
26-06-2020||City||Delhi HC tells builder to donate 250 PPE kits to hospitals, graveyards while dismissing his plea||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court has ordered a builder, who had filed a plea seeking approval of rectifications of a sealed property, to instead donate 250 personal protective equipment (PPE) kits to various hospitals and graveyards in the city.The builder had moved court seeking an opportunity to make rectifications after the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) had sealed the premises for unauthorised construction. The builder had contended that the rectifications in accordance with the corporation’s norms have been made. Justice Nazmi Waziri of the Delhi High Court said that 100 kits be given to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, 25 to the State TB Training and Demonstration Centre, 25 to the Department of Microbiology, National Institute of TB and Respiratory Diseases, 50 to Lok Nayak Hospital and 25 kits each to Lodi Road crematorium and the Panj Peeran graveyard.The court, while passing the order said, “In view of the global pandemic, resulting in countrywide lockdown, there is constant apprehension of contracting the disease from anyone. It is the need of the hour that those engaged on the frontline of dealing with the pandemic and the resultant casualties are provided protective gear.“The petitioner shall supply 250 PPE kits to the following government hospitals, where testing and/or treatment facilities for Covid-19 is being carried out, so as to provide some protection to the medical staff/healthcare workers engaged in combating the pandemic. Also, some PPEs have to be provided to those dealing with the last rites of pandemic-related casualties. The cost of each kit is stated to be about Rs 1, 000,” the court said in an order passed June 11.In another case, the high court Delhi resident Manoj Kumar, who court aggrieved with the disconnection of his 20 electricity meters installed in coaching centres for boys, to donate 25 PPE kits to Shamshan Bhumi, Neb Sarai and the Hauz Rani graveyard near Saket Sports Complex, while deciding the matter on June 16.The court allowed him another chance to pay his pending amount subject to the donation of these ICMR approved PP Kits.Since June this year, Justice Waziri has been directing parties involved in litigations to donate PPE kits sometimes as a cost or for helping the society. In one of the orders passed on June 18, Justice Waziri asked a builder to donate 40 PPE kits, 20 each to junior resident doctors and to the nursing staff of the Lok Nayak hospital, while deciding a case seeking regularisation of construction.Last year, Justice Waziri had passed a series of orders directing litigants to plant tree saplings as a substitute for paying cost or during quashing of FIRs. On February 7, 2019, Justice Waziri had directed several accused in the 2G financial irregularity to plant 16,000 trees in the city after they had failed to file their replies to the plea filed by CBI and ED, challenging the judgment of the trial court acquitting all accused.Due to the orders, the Delhi government had been able to plant over 1.5 lakh trees, mainly in the ridge area, with additional directions to the parties to nurture, nourish and look after the saplings.Since June this year, the judge has directed for donation of a total of 315 PPE kits, besides Rs 25,000 for PPE kits for senior and junior resident doctors of LNJP Hospital, so as to provide some protection to the medical staff and healthcare workers engaged in combating the coronavirus pandemic.In some of his unique orders, Justice Waziri had also directed the North Delhi Municipal Corporation to donate 20 footballs to four Delhi government schools and also plant 100 trees for the delay in dispensing compensation to a man who had suffered 64% disability after being hit by the civic agency’s vehicle.Justice Najmi Waziri had passed the orders in 2019, after the DHO expressed regret over the delay and voluntarily undertook to do some social work, including planting trees and encouraging sports among schoolchildren. Several litigants had also volunteered to plant trees or make donations during the cases as compensations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-hc-tells-builder-to-donate-250-ppe-kits-to-hospitals-graveyards-while-dismissing-his-plea/story-0FJx91H0eZKaE3n1mx4bpK.html
26-06-2020||Noida||GIMS focuses on facilities to patients, chance to build an image, say hospital officials||On a Thursday, the Covid-19 team at Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida, got an emergency message on the WhatsApp group from a very miffed patient. Apparently the patient did not prefer to eat onion and garlic on Thursdays. The team called the kitchen and got the food changed right away. “When the patients arrive here they are often irritated, primarily because of the isolation and the effect that the pandemic has on their thought process,” said Dr Saurabh Srivastava, head of the department Medicine and nodal officer Covid-19 team at GIMS. “So they complain a lot and we understand that. Be it salt in the food, choice of food, tea timings or repeated demand for the tea or coffee, some want to live with their family members who are also infected and admitted here and so on. Our focus, apart from treating them is to provide good facilities, a hygienic environment and give them a welcoming and comfortable stay so that they go back as our goodwill ambassadors and with a change of perception associated with a government hospital.”Doctors say they have adopted a policy to convert such situation into an opportunity to build an image that breaks the general stereotypes associated with “sarkari (government) hospital”.GIMS began by creating a separate WhatsApp group and adding all the patients, doctors, nursing staff, service staff, and even the institute director to addresses their concerns. Another WhatsApp group of staff only discusses the patients’ issues and attempt to resolve them.Some of the complaints, based on the WhatsApp messages, even included objections on the colour of the bedsheet, towels not being fluffy enough, specific pickle for dinner and lunch, soap and toothpaste of their choice, a shaving kit of their choice, smell of the floor wiping liquid and for some even the brand of the medicine.But then there are positive too. Dr. Srivastava showed HT several appreciative messages from discharged patients and also a letter from one patient requesting the transfer of her Covid-19 infected husband from a private hospital in Noida. “We will have to understand what these patients are going through.We have to be more hospitable, understand the psychology of the patient,” said Brigadier (Dr) Rakesh Gupta, director GIMS.GIMS was the city’s first Covid facility and since its first case on March 15, it has so far successfully treated and released over 450 patients. At present, there are around 110 patients in the hospital, against 150 beds and 10 operational ventilators.“We monitor each and every patient. Sometimes they are simply angry or scared and take it out on staff by making weird demands. But we understand their irritation from a psychiatrist’s point of view. We keep sending positive messages, videos of meditation on the WhatsApp group. With time we have seen their perception changing and many keep sending their wishes even after being discharged,” said Dr. Rahul Singh, one of the doctors on GIMS Covid-19 team.Sharing his experience, a patients said his perception of government hospitals change with the experience.“When I found that I was Covid-positive and would be sent to a government medical facility, my heart sunk. I was scared and angry, maybe because of my health conditions, but the behaviour of hospital staff, particularly the doctors, changed my entire perception,” said one patient who stayed for 15 days in the hospital, over the phone.Many patients said that as a goodwill gesture they would volunteer to donate plasma if asked for.“I came here as a scared and skeptic patient perhaps because we have heard so much bad things about the government hospitals. But my perception changed and I left GIMS making friends with many staffers there. I promised officials that I will volunteer to donate my plasma and that I am just one call away,” said another patient, released on the eighth day of her admission.“My husband and I were very nervous upon admission at GIMS, but the staff there had been very generous to us. They ensured that we are free of fear, showed sensitivity, and made sure that our ten day-long stay at the hospital was comfortable,” said another patient from Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gims-focuses-on-facilities-to-patients-chance-to-build-an-image-say-hospital-officials/story-XQ62R7SrBXNwSxOEQcuYEK.html
26-06-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Antigen tests find 9.87% positivity rate on day one; admin begins process for plasma trials||Ghaziabad: The district health department on Friday started with the first round of antigen tests to detect coronavirus (Covid-19) disease cases, during which eight persons were found positive, out of the 81 samples collected. The tests were administered at seven locations across Ghaziabad and testing will be ramped up as the district in coming days has received total of 8,000 antigen kits.“The suspected cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) cases were scanned in containment zones and also in high risk groups. Total of 81 tests were conducted and eight persons were found positive, as per health department records. This is an encouraging sign as the percentage of positive cases is low,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.With the results on Friday, the percentage of positive cases is about 9.87. For this purpose, seven teams have been deployed as against 30 announced on Thursday. The health department said it was due to lesser availability of lab technicians that the number of teams was reduced.Antigen testing has been started in several locations including Vaishali, Jhandapur, Indirapuram, Khoda, Vijay Nagar, Bhovapur and city areas.The district magistrate also inspected one of the antigen test centres in Vaishali. Plasma therapy trials“We have also started the process of preparing a list of people who have recovered from Covid-19 and are ready for donating plasma for trials. We have deputed a nodal officer who will now be assessing the infrastructure availability and will seek permission on this from the Indian Council for Medical Research. There is some infrastructure available with private hospitals and in the government sector. We plan to start the process at the earliest so that patients recover soon,” Pandey added.“We are making calls to patients who have recovered and are encouraging them to donate plasma for the benefit of others who are infected with Covid-19. Seven former patients have given their consent for donating plasma. I have also directed the chief medical superintendents of different L1, L2 and L3 hospitals to get in touch with patients and encourage them to donate plasma. We need to reduce the death rate and see to it that patients recover,” he said.Plasma therapy involves treating the patient with the plasma of a compatible patient who has recovered from Covid-19. The antibodies present in the plasma are expected to help the patient fight the infection.Revision in curfew timings Meanwhile, the divisional commissioner (Meerut) has directed for revised timings of night curfew from 8pm to 6am each days. Earlier, this was from 9pm to 5am.“As per the revised timings, all the markets, liquor shops and business establishments will remain closed from 8pm to 6am. If any shop is found open, action will be taken up,” said a spokesperson of the district administration.More L1 facilitiesWith the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the district, officials are now searching for more facilities that can be used as L1 category hospitals as there is another wave of spike in Covid-19 cases.“As the cases are rising, our L1 Divyajyoti Hospital, which got opened two days ago, now has about 100 patients as against the availability of 250 beds. So now, we are searching for more hospitals. In case we bring up multiple hospitals, it would require more teams for services,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.In accordance with the directions of the Uttar Pradesh government, the Ghaziabad district has proposed for acquisition of 13 different colleges which have a combined capacity of 4,000 L1 beds.“We are searching for more hospitals and planning to come up with a big facility at Radha Swami Satsang Beas at Morta. They have already provided us their premises for stay and transportation of migrant workers. But we need to assess facilities and infrastructure there. The problem in the district is that we have availability of only several colleges where a maximum of 400 beds can be converted to L1 category facilities,” the DM said. According to the new guidelines issued by the state government on June 19, if any asymptomatic patient shows no symptoms, he/she can be discharged without undergoing any test on the tenth day from their date of admission. But, such patients will have to remain in home quarantine for seven days after discharge from hospital.In the context of the new guidelines and the admin scouting for more L1 facilities, the CMO said: “We are hoping that discharge of Covid-19 patients will also become faster after the recently received discharge guidelines.”As per the earlier guidelines, the asymptomatic patients were being discharged only after their first report was negative. Prior to this, a positive patient needed to have two successive negative reports in order to get discharged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-antigen-tests-find-9-87-positivity-rate-on-day-one-admin-begins-process-for-plasma-trials/story-O65XpxdYzXR9Jtnmr4mo6M.html

Her son wanted to take her to Pune, though could not do so in lockdown, nor did he have enough money to pay her rent.A resident of the area took her picture and posted it on social media with his number asking for help to find her son Ravindra Shetty’s contact.The woman was found with a bag comprising bedsheet, books and a diary.“Our team member saw the message on social media. On Wednesday afternoon, we visited the spot, but could not find her there. Locals told us she occupies the footpath during the night. One person from Mulund called us providing the number of the son, which he managed to get on social media and that’s how we contacted the son,” said Marshal Nadar,24, founder of the foundation.The woman’s husband left her a few months ago, after which she could not pay the rent. She was provided with food, clothes and taken to medical check-up by the team after they found her.“Her son and his wife wanted to come to Ulhasnagar to take her, could not come due to the lockdown imposed to fight Covid-19 pandemic. We managed to find the woman on Wednesday night and also called up the son and helped them communicate with each other. On Friday after her medical test and police formalities, we took her to her son’s place on Thursday late night, “added Marshal.The Badlapur rescue team, that rescues animals, arranged a vehicle for the transportation of the woman.The son who works in a private company in Khed claimed that he wasn’t aware of the condition of her mother, as the owner of the house where she lived mislead him.“Four days back, a friend told me about the message on social media. When I saw the photo of my mother, I was shocked. Since my financially unstable, I could not reach Ulhasnagar immediately. I was in touch with the locals and asked them to help me out with transportation,” said Shetty, who lives with his wife at Chakan, Khed in Pune. “I am so grateful to all the people who helped my mother reach safe here. Here in the village, no outsider is allowed due to the outbreak of Covid-19. I was worried about how to bring her to my place, “added Shetty.An officer from Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) said, “Our team had examined the health condition of the woman for any symptoms of Covid infection as she was living on the streets.

26-06-2020||City||Residents risk crossing Hindon canal as cops continue blocking of two major culvert roads between Vaishali and Indirapuram||Residents of Vaishali are in a spot of bother with the Ghaziabad Police blocking two major connecting roads to nearby Indirapuram, since the sector scheme on June 1, but now citing “law and order” as the reason for the continuing blockade. The sector scheme involved sealing an area and thereby severely hampering the movement of residents, except for essential services. It was imposed in Vaishali to counter the rising number of Covid-19 cases. Following a Supreme Court order on June 16, the district administration confined the scheme only to containment zones.The two connecting roads, near Vaishali sector-2 and Vaishali sectors 4 and 5, to Indirapuram, however, are yet to be opened with buses. The roads are bridges over the Hindon Canal, forcing pedestrians to risk their lives as they tip-toe over a pipe to get to the other side.“The culvert road near Sector 2 is blocked by buses. We drop passengers on the Indirapuram side and thereafter they walk to Vaishali using small the drain pipe on the side. This is risky as someone may fall into canal if they slip,” said Rajesh Kumar, an auto driver from Makanpur.“There has been no written order on lifting the sector scheme from Vaishali and neither have the residents been given a list of containment zones. The list should be updated on a daily basis and put in the public domain. There is lot of confusion among residents and many have not yet moved out to their offices,” said Mohit Sharma, resident of Vaishali sector-1.According to the last list issued by the district administration on June 18, Vaishali has 12 containment zones under category 1 and one zone under category 2.“The buses blocking the roads over the two culverts should be moved a bit so that at least pedestrians can move easily. Otherwise, they are moving over a drain pipe adjacent to the Hindon canal. Who will assume responsibility of some mishap takes place,” said Sharma.Anshu Jain, Indirapuram circle officer denied that continued blocking of the roads were part of the sector scheme.“The blocking of roads is part of law and order situation as there have been frequent snatching incidents at the two roads. If we put up barricading, it will have to be guarded throughout. We will consider unblocking part of the road so that pedestrians can walk over the roads,” she said.Residents approached the police to allow at least one of the roads to be opened.“Still, we have asked the police officials to unblock at least one road or make some way for easing movement of pedestrians. Since, most of our customers also arrive from Indirapuram, our businesses are also affected as a result,” said Anirudh Vashishtha, general secretary of Vaishali Udyog Vyapar Mandal.When contacted, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that he will speak to the police about the issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-risk-crossing-hindon-canal-as-cops-continue-blocking-of-two-major-culvert-roads-between-vaishali-and-indirapuram/story-9R1sPHQEk1zgwyGAFzW0yK.html
26-06-2020||City||Couple found hanging in Indirapuram flat||A 30-year-old man and his 28-year-old wife were found dead inside their apartment in Indirapuram’s Gyan Khan on Friday morning. The couple’s eight-month-old son was found at the flat, who they entrusted to the care of the woman’s sister in a text message sent by the woman. Police suspect it to be a case of suicide. They are yet to ascertain what pushed the couple to take such a step.The couple was from Bihar capital Patna and had shifted to the rented accommodation less than a year ago. The man was a sales manager with a firm in Noida and had been working from home since the lockdown while the woman was a homemaker.“Around 3.45am, the woman sent an SMS to her sister, who lives in Greater Noida, asking her to come early morning and pick up the child who would be alone in the house. When her sister saw the message, she panicked and sent one of her friends living in Indirapuram to the couple’s flat, around 6am Friday,” said Anshu Jain, circle officer (Indirapuram).The friend found the main door unlocked and the woman hanging, with the infant on the bed. She then alerted the neighbours and the police were informed. The police inspected the house and found the man hanging in another room.Officers said they have roped in forensic teams. “Their child was taken away by the woman’s sister, and both bodies have been sent for an autopsy. We have not received any complaint from any of their family members so far,” Jain added.Ghaziabad is yet to have a dedicated helpline to help people in trouble. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are +914066202000 from ‘Roshni’ (Hyderabad-based) and +914424640050 from Sneha India Foundation (Delhi-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/couple-found-hanging-in-indirapuram-flat/story-kArU7invWXmm5XL22XgxBI.html
26-06-2020||Chandigarh||Bathinda’s MC’s solar-powered streetlight project gains momentum||After a delay of nearly three months due to the pandemic outbreak, the Bathinda municipal corporation’s project to convert all streetlights to solar power has finally gained momentum.The MC’s project nodal officer, Neeraj Kumar, said a Dehradun-based private agency engaged by the state authorities has applied to the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to execute the project.“The MC has submitted drawing details of three sites to the Punjab Energy Development Agency (PEDA), the nodal agency, for final approval. We expect the project would be commissioned by July-end,” said Kumar.In the first-of-its-kind project in the South Malwa region, the local body is expected to save around ₹2.3 crore a year in electricity bills. There are 25,000 streetlights in the city area and the panels of capacity 2,200KW are to be installed in four localities. These are the vacant space at waterworks stations located near Joggers Park, the industrial growth centre, the sewage treatment plant and the rooftop of the local body’s office. MC superintending engineer Sandeep Gupta said except for the Joggers Park, work to install solar penal on the identified sites is ready. “The MC will pay an estimated ₹9.85 crore for the project. It may provide a major boost to promote alternative sources of energy at other public offices and residents. Further expansion of solar power generation will depend upon this initiative,” Gupta added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bathinda-s-mc-s-solar-powered-streetlight-project-gains-momentum/story-slnzNiFakoWV8EFUSM4ZKJ.html

26-06-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: Bail pleas of Shoma Sen, Varavara Rao rejected||The special National Investigating Agency (NIA) court on Friday rejected the interim bail plea filed by Telugu poet P Varavara Rao and activist Dr Shoma Sen, booked for their role in the Elgar Parishad case.The two had approached the special court for interim bail over the spread of Covid-19 in prison and claimed that they suffer from several health issues, making them vulnerable to the virus. The plea was objected by NIA on the ground that they are booked under provisions of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), hence are not entitled to interim bail.Meanwhile, the special court on Friday heard arguments on the plea of civil rights activist Gautam Navlakha, one of the accused in the case, for bail, as the agency failed to submit charge sheet within a stipulated time frame. The plea was heard through video conferencing whereby Anil Singh, additional solicitor general opposed the plea.The lawyer for Navlakha contended that the agency ought to have submitted the charge sheet against Navlakha within 90 days of his arrest. The defence has also considered the period of 35 days after his arrest by Pune police in 2018. Navlakha was first arrested by the Pune police on August 28, 2018, but the Delhi High court had quashed his arrest on October 1, 2018.After his release, Navlakha was arrested again on April 14 as his plea for anticipatory bail was rejected by all courts. Since his arrest, he is in custody.The plea was opposed by Singh claiming that the order of Delhi high court is challenged and the appeal is pending before the Apex Court. Hence, Singh who represented NIA, claimed that the period of 35 days from August 28, 2018, till October 1, 2018, cannot be considered for grant of bail on the ground of failure of the agency to file a charge sheet.The court would hear further arguments on the bail as well as on the plea of NIA for his custody on July 10.Meanwhile, another accused lawyer Arun Ferreira and human right activist Rona Wilson booked in the case too have approached the court for release from the jail. The two have written mail to the court and sought parole due to spread of Covid-19 in the prison. The plea is objected by the NIA on the ground that they have played a crucial role in the conspiracy.In the reply filed on the plea of Wilson the agency claimed that he was part of the conspiracy to eliminate Prime minister of the country. It is also alleged that he was an active member of the group. The NIA has further alleged that provisions of parole are not available for undertrial prisoners, it is only available for convicted prisoners.The said pleas are also scheduled for hearing on July 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-bail-pleas-of-shoma-sen-varavara-rao-rejected/story-jicozza4oyl9Qqfl8gcsTN.html

She should have quit the ministerial berth to build pressure on the Modi government against the ordinances,” said Mann.“SAD MPs should support my Bill to prove their loyalty towards the farming community in country,” he added.He said that AAP activists will start a protest campaign against the SAD leadership at sub-divisional levels across state on Monday for their stand on the ordinances that are aimed at benefiting the corporate sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bhagwant-mann-to-oppose-farm-ordinances-passed-by-centre/story-XiJ3UxqxVXj38m3gkc7bWM.html

Inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, a SIT member, on Friday submitted an application to the district and sessions judge Harbans Singh Lekhi stating that the Punjab government has set up teams to investigate cases of sacrilege and police firing incidents at Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura. “All these cases are under investigation and at least two chargesheets have been filed in court along with two supplementary challans. Former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal have been examined during the probe and have been arrayed as accused in some cases. All these cases are neither mutually exclusive nor completely similar but inter-related in nature and scope,” the IGP said in the application. Claimed close Sindhia’s family link with the Badals, he added, “The independence and impartiality of judicial institutions is one of the paramount elements of basic structures of the Constitution. Therefore, it is requested not to entrust any case or part of the case at any stage to Sindhia in the larger interest of justice,” he added.The district and sessions judge has asked Sindhia to file his comment on the contents of the application by June 29. Sindhia is the son-in-law of Parkash Singh Badal’s close confidant, who is working for him for a long time, it is learnt. Sindhia was appointed as the duty magistrate for the hearings from June 21 to June 26. During this period, three accused arrested in the Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura police firing cases were presented before him for the proceedings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2015-police-firing-citing-judge-s-family-ties-with-badals-sit-pleads-not-to-assign-cases-to-him/story-MxfgZGd7Ucb8RIdT1oboII.html
26-06-2020||Mumbai||Won’t take China’s help to assemble tunnel-boring machine for coastal road: BMC||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to not take assistance from China to assemble the tunnel boring machine (TBM) that will be used for the construction of a 3km tunnel between Chowpatty and Malabar, a part of the 9km coastal road between Princess Street flyover and Worli.The 12.9mm TBM was imported from China a month ago and BMC had to take assistance from the Chinese manufacturer to assemble it in the TBM shaft. This would have involved TBM manufacturing company’s representatives flying to Mumbai. However, it has now decided to take assistance from Indian experts, and if required, experts from Singapore.BMC claims this decision has nothing to do with the Indo-China clash at the border in Ladakh and was planned a few days before the conflict. According to BMC officials, the decision was taken considering the international travel difficulties owing to the Covid-19 crisis. “China was the first country to report Covid-19 cases, and looking at the situation, it would be difficult to get permission. Hence, before the Indo-China clash in Ladakh, we decided to not take assistance from China. We will take help from Indian experts, and if necessary, experts will be roped in from Singapore. Also, considering the manufacturer is in China, there may be some sort of assistance from there, if required, but we will not have them in Mumbai for the TBM assembly,” said a civic official. Vijay Nighot, chief engineer of BMC’s coastal road project confirmed the decision.HT had reported on April 3, that BMC is likely to give a recommendation letter to allow 30 Chinese nationals to visit the city after one month, terming it a special case for tunnelling work of the ambitious coastal road project. The recommendation letter would help the 30 Chinese nationals – who would provide crucial assistance in assembling these machines – get visas. The civic body had said that it would give the letter only if the situation improves, and the Covid-19 spread is brought under control.A 12.9-m wide TBM being used for the project arrived from China in the last week of April. “We are yet not in the stage to start tunnelling work. Due to delays in the schedule, owing to the outbreak of Covid-19, we are running around two months behind. The actual work of tunnelling will now start in October,” said a BMC official.The coastal road project is already running behind schedule after the Bombay high court stayed the work in July 2019 for want of environment clearances. After BMC challenged the stay in the Supreme Court, pointing out that the project was exempted from the clearance and environment assessment as it had been completed, the Apex court stayed the HC order in December 2019. The coastal road project’s completion has also been postponed to mid-2023 from the earlier deadline of end-2022, and now may get delayed further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/won-t-take-china-s-help-to-assemble-tunnel-boring-machine-for-coastal-road-bmc/story-gLbG9NzaHgMetiquC3DrqO.html

Four children aged between 1 and 5 who were sleeping with their mothers at the time of the incident, were spared. “We have rounded up four men from the village and their questioning is underway. Our preliminary probe suggests that the victims may be killed over a drug-related deal,” said a senior police official,.The police on Thursday had booked Brij Lal’s son Gurjant Singh, and five unidentified persons under Sections 302 (murder), 450 (house trespass), etc of the Indian Penal Code on the complaint of Nishan Singh, who claimed to have been told by one of the children that her uncle (Gurjant) was accompanying the assailants.

26-06-2020||Chandigarh||Rights body accuses SGPC of hiding damage to Guru Granth Sahib saroops||A non-government human rights organisation has accused the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) of hiding the damage caused by fire in 2016 to scores of saroops (copies) of the Guru Granth Sahib at Gurdwara Ramsar Sahib, Amritsar, where these saroops are printed. The apex gurdwara management committee is already under fire for missing of rare manuscripts in the Sikh Reference Library. Citing its findings in a letter written to the Punjab chief secretary, a copy of which was also sent to the Akal Takht Jathedar, the Punjab Human Rights Organisation (PHRO) said, “It has been found in the gurdwara body record that Guru Granth Sahib printing house is short of 267 holy saroops. This came to the fore when an employee posted there revealed all that happened during the fire incident. We have recorded his statement.” “As many as 80 saroops were burnt. Others were damaged with the water of fire tenders on May 19, 2016. Probe of this incident should have been conducted because sacrilege incidents were taking place in Punjab then. Instead of investigating it, the then SGPC president Avtar Singh Makkar and senior officials opted for cremating the saroops which get wet with water, at Goindwal Sahib secretly. No record was maintained of this entire episode so that nobody gets any clue of what happened. No CCTV footage was taken in record, nor was any forensic expert called for examination,” PHRO investigator Sarabjit Singh Verka. The gurdwara committee hid the incident on directions of the leaders of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) which controls it and was in power at that time in Punjab, the rights body claimed. “Actually, the SAD-BJP government was under fire due to sacrilege incidents took place at village Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala in Faridkot district. In order to prevent more criticism ahead of the 2017 assembly elections, the SAD leaders ordered the SGPC to keep the matter under wraps,” reads the letter that demands thorough and fair enquiry of this incident. ‘If allegations proved to be true, responsible persons will not be spared’SGPC spokesperson Kulwinder Singh Ramdas said, “We have received no copy of this. Still, we will get this matter probed. If the allegations are proved to be true, those responsible will not be spared.” SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal could not be contacted for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rights-body-accuses-sgpc-of-hiding-damage-to-guru-granth-sahib-saroops/story-UPkK4KTeXhbU80VjfhnqiN.html
26-06-2020||Delhi||Hindu Rao staff unpaid for three months, protest on hospital premises||At least 250 staffers at the Hindu Rao Hospital, including paramedics, nurses and sanitation staff, protested at the hospital premises on Friday morning demanding salaries due for the past two months and arrears pending since a year and a half. “Around 600 workers have not received their salaries for April-May. Even June is about to end now and there is no certainty as to when will we get our dues. It has become difficult to survive. We had written multiple letters to the administration as well as the mayor, but to no avail. Hence we had to sit in strike in order to be heard,” said Tajender Gujjar, a technician and president, Para Medical Technical Staff Welfare Association. He added that workers were surviving on borrowed money. “Anyways, we have been putting in extra hours because of the pandemic. People have run out of money. Everyone has bank loans and school fee to be paid. How do we survive like this?” A senior official from the North Corporation, under which the hospital falls, said that they had not received funds from the Delhi government for this quarter had hence, could not pay the staff. “We are pursuing the matter with the Delhi government to release the funds for this quarter. As soon as we get the funds, salaries will be disbursed,” the official said. Delhi government officials could not be reached for comment.Indu Jamwal, nursing officer, who has been with the hospital for long, said, “It is very difficult to manage without money these days. This has been the case for at least five years that payment of salaries has been erratic. We are made to suffer between the tussle between the corporations and the Delhi government.” Recently the resident doctors association of the hospital too had written to the administration for not having received their salaries since April 15. The hospital is one of the biggest medical facilities run by the North Corporation. The hospital was declared to become a covid-dedicated facility on June 14 but is yet to start admitting covid-19 patients, as it is still in the process of procuring logistics for treatment of such patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hindu-rao-staff-unpaid-for-three-months-protest-on-hospital-premises/story-Kgv6ChFc2CbF4AWvrYjlTP.html
26-06-2020||City||Delhi police counsel stressed cops, begin ‘Healthy Police, Happy Police’ campaign||New Delhi: A 42-year-old sub-inspector posted in central Delhi had not properly slept since June 17, the day his elderly mother died of the coronavirus infection. The SI, a front line worker, got himself and his family tested for Coivd-19. he results were negative but the fear of him and his family members contracting the disease has led to repeated anxiety and panic attacks. In another similar case, another constable developed obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) due to the virus outbreak. Senior officers said the constable developed a habit of washing hands every 2-3 minutes, which he says has affected him psychologically.“The new habit has taken over his mind so much that he hasn’t been able to sleep or eat properly over the past few weeks. He says he feels confident about the measures taken by the police to prevent the infection from spreading but admits he has not been able to get rid of the fear of contracting the disease,” the police officer said.The sub-inspector and constable aren’t the only policemen facing distress amid the pandemic.Out of 2,705 policemen deployed in Delhi’s central district, as many as 150 have written to the deputy commissioner of police, Sanjay Bhatia, seeking professional help.Bhatia said, in an initiative to help their own men, he distributed forms to all 2,705 of his staff in the central district, asking them to share their problems and seek help accordingly. “Out of 2,705, we have received at least 1,500 forms back. Out of these, 150 have sought help from us. They described in detail the problems they’re facing so that accordingly, we can find solutions. These problems have been divided into three categories -- family-related, psychological and physical medical problems. We have a panel of doctors working with us who will help then through counselling sessions and even guide them for medical assistance in case required,” Bhatia said. The DCP said the initiative is a part of their “Healthy Police, Happy Police” Campaign launched on Friday.Of these 150 police personnel who have written back to the senior officer, many are women. One of them, a woman constable, requested senior officials to arrange counselling sessions for herself as she has heightened worries about the health of her elderly mother.Additional deputy commissioner of police (central) Sikandar Singh said they have started counselling sessions for these police personnel. “Friday was the first day. We will ensure counselling for all of them in batches. 30 police personnel underwent sessions on the first day. All will be professionally dealt with,” Singh said.A counselling centre has been established in Daryaganj, he said.Kaartik Gupta, a clinical psychologist and one of the doctors taking these counselling sessions, said most of the police personnel are facing anxiety issues because they fear for their families as they’ve been working at the front line.“They are facing emotional problems because they have been isolating themselves from their loved ones and have no one to talk to. Sleep difficulty was another common complaint among the police personnel. Some of them may require medication or further treatment. Others may require psychotherapy, and proper follow-up sessions” Gupta said.He said, on Friday, he gave 25-30 minutes to every police personnel. “But we need to increase the session timings because these sessions must last 45 minutes to one hour. We need time to build a rapport and make them feel comfortable to share their thoughts and feelings,” he said.Some of them had problems prior to the lockdown but have escalated during the pandemic, Gupta said. Treatment process has to be modelled keeping their tough working hours and conditions in mind, the doctor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-police-counsel-stressed-cops-begin-healthy-police-happy-police-campaign/story-wNKbdGVuY5ISaLxYtRMZPP.html

Had our jawans been given weapons, they would have done more damage to the enemy, he said.The state Congress chief asked PM Narendra Modi to clarify it to the people that when the government was aware of the tension in Galwan Valley and a few days ago there was also a clash with the enemy, why were the soldiers sent without weapons.He also asked the Union government to explain how China had taken over the country’s land when PM Modi used to claim closeness with the Chinese president. “Even now the entire country and all the political parties were with the Union government to take appropriate decision, but the weakness of the Union government was causing embarrassment to all, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/india-s-repute-tarnished-globally-due-centre-s-weak-leadership-jakhar/story-p9oEzgvno6iUrnsQks06eN.html

The exercise has started. We hope to meet the July 6 deadline,” another official said.“We will engage domestic breeder checkers, sanitation workers and teachers of municipal corporation schools for the survey, if we require their services in the coming days,” he added.This is a trust-based exercise, the official said, adding, “We cannot force somebody to undergo the test. We only update the information based on the answers to our questionnaire and conduct the rapid antigen test on those who have Covid-19-like symptoms.” According to a revised Covid-19 response plan issued by the Delhi government, the house-to-house screening will be completed by June 30 in the containment zones and July 6 in the remaining areas of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-1-100-teams-formed-to-conduct-house-to-house-survey-in-delhi/story-WEKA4WGX109xCF9jwV6rKL.html

Dayanidhi replaced Sameer Unhale, who held the position for only a month in Ulhasnagar.He assured that he will work on ways to control the spread of Covid-19. “On my first day, I am trying to understand the situation and the spread of the outbreak in Ulhasnagar. We shall form a stronger system to fight the pandemic,” said Dayanidhi.Dayanidhi is an IAS officer from 2016 batch and was posted in Gondia as the chief executive officer of Zilla Parishad.“Gondia has a zero Covid fatality rate, but Ulhasnagar is a municipal corporation, and many people here travel to Mumbai regularly. Moreover, it has a huge population as well, hence the way to handle the pandemic is different here. However, providing proper facilities and increasing awareness among the residents will be the focus,” said Dayanidhi. Ulhasnagar has, so far, reported 1,326 positive cases, 39 deaths.“There have been instances of people gathering in large numbers and bodies of Covid victims being handed over to families for the funeral, that led to an increase in positive numbers.

Chautala reached Tanwar’s residence around 11 am and the two leaders spoke for over two hours, amid speculations that the latter is set to join the INLD.Later, talking to Hindustan Times over the phone, Tanwar said that Abhay Chautala had made courtesy call to his house.“We discussed the political landscape of Haryana wherein the ruling party has failed to address the public’s concerns and the opposition too is silent,” Tanwar said while adding that people are now looking at an alternative opposition to raise their concerns.Tanwar had quit the Congress ahead of the 2019 state assembly polls after he was replaced by Kumari Selja as the state unit chief. In his four-page resignation letter to interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Tanwar had said that the grand-old party was going through an existential crisis-- not because of its political opponents but because of the ‘internal rift’. He was known to have had differences with senior Congress leader and two-time chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and had also even accused some senior party leaders of selling tickets after his loyalists were not nominated to contest the polls. When asked if he would join the INLD, Tanwar said that he is not thinking of joining any party as of now but maintained that “anything is possible in politics.”“Politics is all about the right timing. I can assure the public that I will remain in the opposition. My main focus will be on raising the issues of farmers, labourers, students and employees,” he added.INLD’s lone MLA from Ellenabad, Abhay Singh Chautala said that Bhupinder Singh Hooda is supporting the Bharatiya Janata Party-Jannayak Janta Party government as they had cleared the way for his son Deepender Singh Hooda’s entry into the Rajya Sabha by not putting up any contestant against him.“I met Ashok Tanwar today and our meeting was fruitful. Many leaders of other parties are in touch with me and they will join the INLD in the coming days. Our party is the main opposition party on the ground and we are committed to raise public issues,” Abhay added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/inld-leader-abhay-chautala-meets-former-haryana-cong-chief-tanwar/story-ooigytI6XJEoTxibEKQlYK.html
26-06-2020||Kolkata||Mamata urges Centre to stop domestic flights to Kolkata from Covid hotspot states till July 31||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee urged the Centre on Friday to stop international repatriation flights and domestic flights to Kolkata from states with a high Covid-19 prevalence till July 31 and relaxed the night curfew in the state by an hour from July 1.She also said she wants the metro rail services to resume from July 1, but only with 100-per cent seat occupancy and no passenger standing.“We have decided that (from July 1) the night curfew hours will be from 10 pm to 5 am. We also want the metro rail to resume services from July 1 while following all the precautionary and sanitisation norms and only with a 100-per cent seat occupancy policy,” Banerjee told a press conference here.Currently the night curfew hours are from 9 pm to 5 am.Alleging that those coming to the state by air are not being adequately screened at the airports, leading to an increase in the number of coronavirus cases, Banerjee urged the Centre to stop domestic flights to Kolkata from states with a high Covid-19 prevalence till July 31.“Recently we came to know that a few Covid-19 patients came from Chennai and were not screened at the airport. Later, they got themselves admitted to a hospital in Midnapore. We are planning to write a letter to the Centre to stop domestic flights and special trains to Kolkata till July 31 from hotspots and those states with a high number of Covid-19 cases,” the chief minister said while inaugurating various projects online from the state secretariat.She also urged the Union government to stop international repatriation flights to the state as the returnees are not following the institutional quarantine norms, leading to a spike in the number of coronavirus cases in West Bengal.“As far as international flights are concerned, we will send a letter to the Centre to stop the service as of now. If they want to go ahead with their plan, then I think they should allow one flight a month by strictly following all the safety norms,” Banerjee said.“The domestic flights within the state from Kolkata to Bagdogra in Siliguri and Andal in Burdwan can operate. We do not have any objection to that,” she added.The chief minister said the Kolkata metro should ensure that it runs trains without any passenger standing or the coaches being overcrowded.Earlier this week, Banerjee announced the extension of the coronavirus-induced lockdown in the state till July 31.The chief minister accused opposition parties of indulging in politics at a time of crisis to score political brownie points.“We have already stopped big gatherings, but some political parties are violating the lockdown norms and organising gatherings and rallies. They are conducting rallies without police permission. We will not tolerate this. If someone breaks the rule, the law will take its own course. I do not even spare my own party workers,” she said.Speaking about her party’s “Martyr’s Day” rally on July 21, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo said it would be observed, but in a much different way.“We will conduct a virtual meeting with our party leadership on July 3 to decide on the July 21 rally,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/mamata-urges-centre-to-stop-domestic-flights-to-kolkata-from-covid-hotspot-states-till-july-31/story-o5YmrXAAYwfO9A9bUxWSdI.html

If data of suicides is taken into consideration during lockdown and Unlock 1.0, the average of people dying of suicide everyday is 5.5.According to data of the state government, 449 people have died by suicide in March, April and upto June 25.

One person is dying by suicide every 4.50 hours.Psychiatrists say that the depression due to lockdown has made deep impact on minds of the people.“During lockdown and Unlock 1.0 around 1,200 people suffering from depression have approached our institute. During lockdown we were getting more than 150 phone calls everyday from people suffering from depression. There were 20 per cent people who had given up hope to live and wanted to end their life,” said a doctor at the Central Institute of Psychiatry here.Dr Sanjay Kumar Mandal, a psychiatrist of CIP admitted a large number of people approached the institute during lockdown suffering from depression.In state capital Ranchi, 55 people died by suicide from April 1 to June 25. Psychiatrists say that economic slowdown, fear of losing jobs, unemployment and other factors caused deep depression among people. The sense of insecurity prompted many people to take this step. “People were locked inside homes during lockdown which led to rise in disputes among family members, and domestic violence witnessed spurt. These factors promoted many people to commit suicide as they were unable to control their emotions. The right counselling within family could have saved many lives” said psychiatrist Ajay Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/covid-19-over-5-people-died-by-suicide-daily-during-lockdown-in-jharkhand/story-Ox96Lb8TivjYpeV2Y9dJYK.html

They also accused authorities of paying around Rs 41 lakh for the kits, which according to the staff should not have cost more than Rs 7 lakh.Subsequently, Amritsar deputy commissioner Shiv Dular Singh Dhillon had marked an enquiry into matter on April 24. However, two months on the probe has not been initiated. Upset over the delay and ‘multiple attempts to sabotage the probe’, local MP Gurjeet Singh Aujla, who had given the hospital Rs 1 crore from his Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) fund, part of which was used to purchase PPEs, sought the Union government’s intervention. “The probe into allegations of a scam in the purchase of Covid-19 related PPE equipment is being deliberately delayed. Action must be taken at the earliest,” he wrote in a letter to the Centre. Noting Aujla’s complaint, deputy secretary (MPLADS) Raj Krishan Bhoria wrote to the Punjab State Planning Board principal secretary saying, “Necessary action in the matter may be taken in a time bound manner.

26-06-2020||Mumbai||No relief for flat buyers from HC||The Bombay high court has directed the flat buyer who filed public interest litigation challenging the six-month extension given by the MahaRERA authority to projects that were to be completed by March 15 to approach the MahaRERA appellate authority and declined to quash the circular. The court upheld the contention of the state that as an alternate remedy was available to the petitioner, there was no need for the court to exercise its powers.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice M S Karnik while hearing the PIL filed by Sagar Nikam, a flat buyer was informed that the April 2 and May 18 circulars by the MahaRERA authority was detrimental to the interests of thousands of flat buyers. Advocate Nilesh Gala for Nikam said that circulars favoured developers who had failed to hand over possession of flats by March 15. He added that the three-month extension given in each circular would deny flat buyers their right to their homes by six months and hence the circulars should be set aside,However, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni who was assisted by additional government pleader Jyoti Chavan informed the court that Nikam’s grievance of not getting possession of the flat within the stipulated time was personal and hence could not be dealt with in a PIL. Kumbhakoni further submitted that as per section 44 of the RERA Act the flat buyer had the option of approaching the appellate authority and hence Nikam could get his grievance addressed before the said authority. In light of these submissions, Kumbhakoni submitted that the PIL should be dismissed.Gala, however, opposed the contention and said that the PIL had challenged the circular because it not only affected him but also thousands of flat buyers. He submitted that the circular exempted developers and promoters from not only handing over possession of flats for six months but also denied compensation to the flat buyers in that period. He added that the appellate authority could not impugn the circulars as it was beyond its jurisdiction. After hearing the arguments the bench upheld the state’s submissions and granted liberty to the petitioner to approach the appellate authority and dismissed the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-relief-for-flat-buyers-from-hc/story-VvALGbBL3GF2Kcn4OtG9wN.html

He also expressed concern about the serious allegations of corruption and nepotism in relief distribution which had led to serious law and order problems in the affected areas, where BDO offices have been gheraoed and some representatives of the political party publicly thrashed.Dhankhar exhorted that relief distribution is a state function and has to be carried out by the officials concerned. Abandonment of such relief work in favour of political party workers is illegal, he said. “Before this takes an unmanageable dimension, officials responsible for this omission and commission be dealt as per law,” he said. The governor said the undue benefit that has gone to non-entitled beneficiaries must be recovered and they be suitably dealt with according to law.The Trinamool Congress leadership has dismissed charges of corruption and nepotism in distribution of relief material, saying some stray incidents were being projected to malign the party.

This policy can neither bring foreign direct investments nor can it bring technologies or knowhow which we are unable to access today,” Banerjee wrote in her letter to Modi on Thursday night. “The recent trend and empirical evidences clearly showcase the interest of global investors more in renewable energy projects as compared to the coal mining projects. In fact, research suggests that about 100 global financial institutions have divested their thermal coal investments. Therefore, FDI in thermal coal is a far cry,” she said. The chief minister also described the move of the coal ministry to shift the desk offices of four of its subsidiary companies from the state as an “abrupt decision” and requested the prime minister to intervene in the matter. “I would, therefore, request you to kindly reconsider the decision of allowing 100 per cent FDI in coal sector and also strongly urge your kind intervention for advising the ministry of coal not to go ahead with the decision of Coal India Ltd to wind up their subordinate offices from Kolkata,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/reconsider-decision-allowing-100-fdi-in-coal-mining-bengal-cm-mamata-to-pm-modi/story-Rz9UIFp4ZIim2u18A5bPdN.html

26-06-2020||Pune||Monsoon preparedness: PMC on weak foundation with pending survey and structural audit||Pune The 2019 flash floods and two wall collapse incidents in Pune at the beginning of monsoon claimed 23 people in July. The tragedy forced the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to conduct a structural audit of all retaining walls and put in place other preventive measures.The civic administration, however, seems to have learnt little from its past mistakes. The PMC engineering department staff are yet to make a physical visit of boundary or fencing walls across the city.Seventeen residents died and three were injured after a portion of the Alcon Stylus residential building compound wall came crashing down on the temporary shacks of labourers located next to the highrise residential complex after heavy rainfall. Among the dead included four children and a woman. A district official said the wall crashed owing to heavy rains.Neither survey nor structural audit of both the residential complex and the neighbouring constructions was completed by the PMC, activists alleged.A building permissions department superintending engineer officer, on condition of anonymity, said that the survey could not be completed because of the ongoing Covid-19 situation as majority of the staff is engaged in the contagion prevention work.According to the department, the threat is less this year compared to 2019 as many migrant labourers have left for their native places because of the coronavirus spread.The civic administration also took a far-reaching decision of shifting labourers located at 450 construction sites to safe places after their settlements were found to pose threat to their lives.In the second incident which took place in Ambegaon last year, six labourers died due to a wall collapse incident after heavy rainfall. The civic administration is yet to conduct the mandatory survey of the dangerous fencing walls which it claimed to complete before the onset of monsoon.RTI activist Vijay Kumbhar said, “PMC does not show any accountability in discharging its duties. It makes announcements to pacify residents during crisis and then backs out. It is a mere lip service as the PMC is not performing its duty of making life safe for its people. The negligence should be probed and PMC’s irresponsibility should be exposed.”After these incidents, the labour commissioner’s office conducted a detailed survey of under-construction residential labour sites for over 90 days and registered more than 15,000 workers. The move was aimed at providing them safety and benefits under the various sections of the central and state labour act. However, the process fizzled out with the passage of time, labour activists claim.Senior labour leader BJ Kerkar said, “The PMC failed to keep its word and endangered the lives of residents and labours working at different construction sites. We will be writing to the PMC commissioner about the non-conduct of the survey and lack of further action by the civic body.” Kerkar demanded that the PMC and labour department must jointly carry out the work in the larger interests of residents and labour community. PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad could not be reached for his comments.Pune MP Girish Bapat’s media office informed that he would not be commenting on the issue as the work was directly related to the PMC and it was a policy decision by the administration.Man-made tragedy?June 29, 2019Seventeen people, including four children and two women, were killed while two others were injured when a compound wall of Alcon Stylus housing society in Kondhwa collapsed on the makeshift shanties adjacent to it. The police arrested two real estate developers Vivek Sunil Agarwal (32) and Vipul Sunil Agarwal (30) in connection with the wall collapse incident. The police had held the builders liable for wilfully neglecting the repair and strengthening of the retaining wall.July 1, 2019Six construction workers were killed in their sleep and four others injured when a boundary wall collapsed and buried their shanties in Pune’s Ambegaon on account of heavy rains in the city. The then Pune district collector had said that the nine-foot-high boundary wall collapsed mostly due to gushing waters and uprooted trees in the area had weakened its foundation. Victims were buried under the debris of the wall of an educational institute of Sinhgad Group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/wall-collapse-incidents-claim-23-lives-in-2019-pmc-on-weak-foundation-with-pending-survey-and-structural-audit/story-oc61ltQWgVckyWzw5ay7PI.html

26-06-2020||Jaipur||Notice sent to Jaipur hospital for conducting trials of Patanjali drug on Covid-19 patients||Rajasthan’s Health Department has served a notice to NIMS hospital here seeking an explanation on conducting trials of Patanjali Ayurved’s drug Coronil on coronavirus patients, an official said on Friday. “We served notice to the hospital on Wednesday evening seeking explanation in three days. The hospital did not inform the state government nor sought permission,” Chief Medical and Health Officer, Jaipur, Dr Narottam Sharma said. He said the reply from National Institute of Medical Science (NIMS), Jaipur is awaited. The launch of the drug by yoga guru Ramdev on Tuesday triggered a debate after which the Ayush Ministry sought all information on its trial and put a ban on advertising it as a drug to cure coronavirus. The Rajasthan government has clarified that the drug cannot be not used as a medicine in the state without the permission of the Ministry of AYUSH. State Health Minister Raghu Sharma had said on Wednesday that strict action would be taken against the seller as per the rules in case of sale of any drug as a medicine to treat the coronavirus infection. At the Coronil launch, the company had claimed that its medicine can cure the contagious disease within seven days.It said Coronil, taken along with another product developed by it, had shown a 100 per cent success rate in clinical trials on infected patients, except those on life support. Ramdev said the medicines were developed by Patanjali Research Center, Haridwar in association with privately-owned National Institute of Medical Science (NIMS), Jaipur. The Uttarakhand government will serve a notice to Patanjali Ayurved for launching a drug claiming to be a cure for Covid-19 when it had only applied for a licence to manufacture an immunity booster against cough and fever. Apart from the notice from the Uttarakhand government, the Haridwar-based firm could also face litigation in Bihar. A complaint has been filed against it in a Muzaffarpur court over its claim.A complainant approached the court seeking the registration of an FIR against Ramdev and company chairman Acharya Balkrishna, alleging that they put at risk the lives of lakhs of people by claiming to have developed a Covid-19 cure. Chief Judicial Magistrate Mukesh Kumar posted the matter for hearing on June 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/notice-sent-to-jaipur-hospital-for-conducting-trials-of-patanjali-drug-on-covid-19-patients/story-EYNRoxCZ7wmqLyQie7j0TJ.html

Students after completing their homework, give three missed calls to the teacher, who then evaluate assignments received on WhatsApp. The students who don’t have smartphones and access to the internet keep doing every day’s work as assigned in the time table and on the eighth day after completing assignments they will visit the place of the school administrator committee member who will at the same moment click the pictures of his/her notebook and send it to the class teacher.“This method of education helps to conduct classes without staying online for hours and it is not even possible in villages like Pabe,” said Suresh Koli, principal, zilla parishad school.“Currently in Velhe taluka, there are only two active cases and 34 total cases. Since we are following government orders to not to open the school, we have decided to come out with the ‘Lockdown Pabe pattern’,” said Koli.With the help of Pabe pattern, the school is able to complete its syllabus in the same way during normal time.“We feel like normal classes are going on. I miss my friends while studying, but other than that everything feels the same like a normal school,” said Shweta Renuse, a Class 6 student.“Keeping in mind the lockdown, ZP school at Pabe has shown a unique way of conducting classes. Now we are using the same pattern for all the schools in the taluka,” said Sunil Mugle, block education officer, Velhe.There are a total of 78 students in ZP primary school and it has classes till Class 7.“The studies were affected as there was no access to physical classes. The principal came up with this idea so that students do not suffer due to the lockdown,” said Vishal Shinde, block development officer, Velhe.What is Lockdown Pabe pattern-Time table for 15 days is prepared by the school administration-Class teacher of every class will prepare a time table on the basis of the school syllabus-Time table will be given to every student via WhatsApp and those who don’t have WhatsApp, school administrator committee members will visit his/her place to hand over the time table-Students will study by referring to books which were distributed to them on June 14-Students will do the assignments and they will send photos of assignments to their teachers via WhatsApp and will give them three missed calls-Once a teacher receives three missed calls from respective students, he/she will check his/her assignments and will call back the student to clear his/her doubts.

The SGPC plans to plant jungles on one-acre of land at 90 historic gurdwaras in Punjab and its neighbouring states.The project was inaugurated at Gurdwara Baba Bir Singh, Rattoke, and Gurdwara Bir Baba Budha Sahib, Thatha, in Tarn Taran district. In the first phase, 50 jungles will be developed and all saplings found in jungles will be planted so as to revive biodiversity.SGPC chief secretary Roop Singh said, “The environment of Punjab was once so clean that migrant labourers would say the water of the state was as useful to them as milk. Today, unfortunately, the state’s water, air and soil have become polluted. Therefore, the SGPC has passed a resolution to use at least one acre land at 90 historic gurdwaras that are being managed under the apex gurdwara body.”50 FORESTS TO BE PLANTED BY NOVEMBER “The task has been handed over to Baba Sewa Singh because he is a true environmentalist. Nobody else can render the service better than him. We have set a goal to establish 50 such jungles by end of November this year”.“Around 2,500 to 4,200 saplings will be planted in each jungle. The saplings will be of 43 varieties and will include fruit trees, floral plants, mango, medicinal plants, bushes, forest trees and traditional trees. The forests will be developed in such a way that animals are able to inhabit them.” 44 FORESTS PLANTED SO FAR Meanwhile, Baba Sewa Singh, who is the head of a Khadoor Sahib-based Kar Sewa Organisation, said, “Developing these jungles is part of our drive to plant 550 jungles. This drive was initiated to commemorate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak. So far, 44 forests have been developed in different towns and villages of Punjab and 28,210 saplings have been planted in these mini forests”.In another project, teams of the Kar Sewa Organisation are planting trees on both sides of the Amritsar-Harike Road.

So there needs to be clarity,” Deshmukh said.On this demand, senate president and SPPU vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar said, “As per the state government’s decision of cancelling the first and second year students’ exams, we have started the process of declaring their results.

The cops said that the couple left behind their eight-month-old baby on bed and had also dropped an SMS to a relative in Greater Noida to come and pick up the child early in the morning.The police said that the couple was native of Patna in Bihar and had shifted to the rented flat in Indirapuram about 8-10 months ago. The man, employed with a company in Noida, was working from home during the lockdown period, while his wife was a homemaker.“An SMS was sent from her (woman’s) phone to her sister in Greater Noida around 3.45am. In the message she asked her sister to come early in the morning and pick up the child who would be alone. After her sister received the SMS, she panicked and sent one of her friends living in Indirapuram to the couple’s flat around 6am on Friday,” said Anshu Jain, circle officer (Indirapuram).After the friend reached the flat, she found the main door unlocked and went inside to find that the woman was dead in her room and the child was nearby.After this, neighbours were alerted and the police were called.After inspection, the police found that the man was also lying dead in another room.

Patwari later said he regretted his comments and that daughters are like goddesses.“My tweet was to suggest how people have been waiting for years for development promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi but they got instead demonetisation, GST, unemployment, inflation and economic slowdown which have broken the backbone of the economy,” he said.Chouhan accused the Congress of insulting women and asked Sonia Gandhi, the party chief, to apologise to the nation and sack Patwari.However, the Congress accused the BJP of being anti-Dalit and said it has a “prejudiced mindset”.The party’s comment came after a photograph purportedly showing Dalit leader Prabhuram Chaudhary eating off a disposable plate in front of his upper-caste BJP colleague, Ashutosh Tiwari, who is seen eating from a metal plate, went viral on social media on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/bjp-s-jyotiraditya-scindia-hits-out-at-congress-for-insulting-remarks-against-women/story-7uSJqb1YwBoIwqXoCWYNUK.html

Her body was burnt in a forest in neighbouring Raigad district.Former media baron Peter Mukerjea, who was later arrested for allegedly being part of the conspiracy, is currently out on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sheena-bora-murder-case-court-rejects-sanjeev-khanna-s-bail-plea/story-FnYhzjNklbmEajzqzg7JUN.html

He said the Delhi government has taken steps to arrest the deterioration in cases by introducing plasma therapy and providing pulse oximeters to patients to help monitor their oxygen levels.“We’ve increased testing by three times but positive cases have increased by around 3000 per day only. Out of the total Covid-19 patients, approximately 45,000 people have recovered,” said Kejriwal.The Delhi CM said the government has got the permission to conduct plasma therapy at Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital (LNJP) and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital. Since the start of plasma therapy at LNJP hospital, Kejriwal said, the number of deaths has reduced to less than half as compared to earlier. Watch | ‘Will increase ICU beds’: Arvind Kejriwal on covid situation in Delhi“It may be difficult to save very serious patients using plasma therapy, but it can help moderate patients by not letting their condition worsen. This is what we have found till now,” said the CM.Use of plasma therapy involves injecting blood-component plasma extracted from a cured coronavirus patient into a positive case. The plasma of a cured patient is considered to carry virus-fighting antibodies which boost the immune system’s response to the disease. Plasma is the almost-clear liquid left behind after red and white blood cells and platelets are removed from the blood.Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain, who is recovering from the Covid-19, was also administered the therapy at a private hospital after a pneumonia patch in his lung started expanding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/plasma-therapy-helping-moderate-covid-19-patients-stabilise-delhi-cm-kejriwal/story-dlj2zUzL2bW6OHMyMZaxRK.html

After visiting the scene, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar said the blaze was triggered by a short circuit and the heavy smoke made it difficult for the fire fighters to find the source of the flames.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/major-fire-doused-at-raguvanshi-mills-in-mumbai/story-2YmXDV2OYFBniWeOrvAp1I.html
26-06-2020||Chandigarh||Cash-strapped Himachal Pradesh govt hikes vehicle registration fee; cuts power subsidy||Shimla: In a jolt to consumers amid the Covid-19 crisis, the cash-strapped Himachal Pradesh government has enhanced vehicle registration fee and cut electricity subsidy to generate resources.The two decisions were taken at a cabinet meeting on Thursday.The vehicle registration fee has been increased to 7-10% from the existing 2.5-4%.The registration fee will be 7% for motorcycles up to ₹50,000; 8% for vehicles above ₹50,000 and up to ₹2 lakh and; 10% for above ₹2 lakh.The car has a duty of 8% to 10%. The government will also charge 100% of composite fee from small contract carriers coming to Himachal Pradesh with riders from outside states. Besides, the arrangement of 15-day wavier for contract carriers who paid the entire tax for a month in one go has been done away with.The cabinet also decided to withdraw ₹110 crore out of the earlier announced subsidy of ₹480 crore for the Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board (HPSEB).This has been done to rationalise the subsidy given to the consumers.According to government data, 18% of the subsidy goes to 11 lakh consumers using less than 125 units per month and the rest goes to nine lakh consumers with consumption more than 125 units.There will be no change in the power bills for consumers using electricity less than 125 units.The consumers with consumption of 125-200 units per month will have an increase of ₹40-₹113 in their monthly bills.Similarly, those consuming 201 to 300 units will see an increase of ₹115 to ₹200. For consumption of units between 301 up to 400 units, the increase will be ₹200 to ₹290. The increase will be ₹300 to ₹400 for consumption of 401 units or above.The government claims that the power tariffs in Himachal Pradesh were lowest compared to neighboring states. In Punjab and Uttarakhand, consumers pay ₹6.59 and ₹3.27 per unit, respectively, for the consumption of 125-300 units. In Himachal Pradesh, the rate is ₹2.62.NO HIKE IN BUS FARESThe government has refused to increase the bus fare but has given in-principle approval for plying buses with 100% occupancy.The private bus operators in the state are demanding an increase in the bus fare given the reduced occupancy of 60% due to Covid-19. They were demanding an increase in the minimum bus fare from ₹5 to ₹10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cash-strapped-himachal-pradesh-govt-hikes-vehicle-registration-fee-cuts-power-subsidy/story-vwq3cvnRGH6YVByNkaoibN.html

26-06-2020||Chandigarh||Dadumajra waste processing plant: Possession to remain with Chandigarh MC||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday ordered status quo in the operation of Dadumajra garbage processing plant. The order came on the plea of the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) that had challenged the June 19 decision of a Chandigarh court allowing plant’s operation by the Jaypee group, a private operator. The MC had taken the plant’s possession on June 19 evening before the court order reached it. The high court has also appointed an arbitrator in the proceedings. The detailed order is awaited.With the plant running much below its full capacity, resulting in dumping of the garbage in the open, the MC General House had terminated the contract with the firm and directed MC officials to take its possession in February this year. The civic body had issued a termination notice on March 5, asking the firm to hand over the plant within a week. On this, the firm moved a Chandigarh court that ordered a stay for three months on March 12. After the period elapsed on June 12, MC issued a 24-hour notice on June 18, and took over the plant on June 19. The firm had moved a trial court on June 20 for restoration of possession. But the court refused to interfere.In high court, MC argued that it had taken control of the plant, hired approximately 80 employees of the firm and waste was being processed. The court was told that after taking over of the plant, they had found that approximately 20,000 metric tonnes of waste was lying on the premises, increasing likelihood of pandemic-like situation during the rainy season. In the last six months, the firm had processed only 60-70 metric tonnes per day on an average, despite clear directions of the National Green Tribunal to process 450 metric tonnes per day. As a result, the unprocessed waste was either being discarded in the dumping ground outside or being collected on the plant’s premises, the court was told by MC’s counsel, Deepali Puri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dadumajra-waste-processing-plant-possession-to-remain-with-chandigarh-mc/story-eelyj98mbjK5HSL7p2LTLO.html

He said that “even peons are not treated or transferred the way civic commissioners across the district were treated”. “The state failed to control the virus and is now trying to make a scapegoat out of commissioners,” Darekar said. Speaking about Covid-19 outbreak in Thane, he said that for three months former Thane civic commissioner had set up a system to fight against the virus but he was removed from the post and someone else was appointed.He said, “Transferring commissioner is not the solution to fight Covid-19. The state should instead provide such cities with enough manpower and health care facilities to flatten the curve,” he said. Darekar also claimed that though the chief minister inaugurated a 1,000-bed hospital in Thane, there are no doctors to operate this facility.Padalkar will clarify his statementWhen asked about Gopichand Padalkar’s unparliamentary remarks on Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supremo, Darekar stated that Padalkar will himself give a clarification on his statement. “The statement he made is his personal view, the party does not support it.

26-06-2020||Mumbai||Yes Bank case: CBI files charge sheet against Wadhawans, Kapoors||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday filed a charge sheet against Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor, his daughter Roshni Kapoor, and the promoters of Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL) Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan, alleging that the Kapoors and the Wadhawans conspired to siphon off public money and benefit themselves, two officers familiar with the development said.The charge sheet comes just before the 60-day filing deadline from the date of arrest was to end. The Wadhawans were arrested by CBI on April 26 from a Mahabaleshwar government facility, after it was found that they had slipped out of Mumbai quietly with their family during the lockdown. They have already been questioned and are currently lodged in a jail in Mumbai.A senior CBI officer cited above said they will soon arrest Rana and interrogate him. The agency’s first charge sheet, the two officials said, focuses on an alleged criminal conspiracy by Rana Kapoor in the investment of ~3,700 crore by Yes Bank in short term debentures of DHFL between April and June 2018, for which Kapil Wadhawan allegedly paid a kickback of ~600 to the Kapoor family in the garb of a loan. According to the agency, the money was given by Wadhawan to M/s DoIT Urban Ventures, a wholly owned subsidiary of RAB Enterprises, in which Roshni is a director. This money, the second officer said, was given on the basis of a mortgage of a property that has a much lower marker value by considering its future conversion from agricultural land to the residential land. DHFL never repaid the bank’s ~3,700 crore investment, and neither did the bank ask for it, the agency said in its charge sheet. Yes Bank also sanctioned a loan of ~750 crore to RKW Developers Pvt Ltd – a company belonging to Dheeraj Wadhawan for their Bandra reclamation project. The money reached the parent company DHFL without any investment in the said project, the officer added. CBI suspects that over 100 shell companies were used by the Kapoor family for diverting money, the first officer said. He added that this may be the first of the many charge sheets which will be filed in the case. Kapoor’s lawyer Subhash Jadhav and the Wadhawans’ lawyer Amit Desai declined to comment. Rana has also been charged by the Enforcement Directorate for money laundering. While filing its charge sheet on May 6, ED said that Rana Kapoor used Yes Bank as his “personal fiefdom” to carry out alleged illegal activities and was the architect of a financial fraud to create wealth for himself and his family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-case-cbi-files-charge-sheet-against-wadhawans-kapoors/story-uej7dg8CzMprCuTubdpaKK.html

In a jibe, the editorial said the “increasing fuel prices might be filling the coffers of the Centre, but it should keep in mind that it is emptying the pockets of common man”.Fuel prices were hiked for the 19th day in a row on Thursday. After an 82-day hiatus, oil companies restarted revising prices in line with costs on June 7. In the past 18 days, diesel and petrol got dearer by ₹10.48 and ₹8.50, respectively, the editorial said.In a strongly worded editorial, the Sena said fuel prices are any government’s source of revenue, but there should be a “limit” to it. “Only two things are increasing in the country today – Covid-19 count and fuel prices... There is at least an attempt to curb the Covid-19 spread, but there is total silence on the rising fuel prices. Since the lockdown ended, the Covid-19 cases have increased and since ‘unlock’ fuel prices are skyrocketing,” the editorial said.The editorial added that for the first time ever, diesel became costlier than petrol in the country in New Delhi.The write-up in the Marathi daily added that although the country has been ‘unlocked’, people still do not have jobs. “The government unlocked the country to bring the economy back on track, but oil companies have unlocked the prices of petrol and diesel to their advantage,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sena-attacks-centre-over-rising-fuel-prices/story-6WyiF7xb8RUo2ePoqLlkRN.html

The car skidded for a few metres before hitting the side wall and turned turtle while two tyres got detached from the vehicle, said police.The four men — Omkar Bhagat, Omkar Shinde, Harshal Patil and Stalin Fernandes, all aged between 20 and 22 — are residents of Bonkhode village in Koparkhairane and were travelling in Bhagat’s car. Fernandes died in the crash, while Patil is in a critical condition and the other two suffered major injuries.The group had gone out for a joyride along Palm Beach Road when the accident took place around 1.45am. They had reached sector 6 near Sarsole junction when Patil was unable to control the speed. Police said the skid marks stretched for several metres indicating that Patil tried to apply brakes but the car was at a “dangerously high speed”.Patil ended up hitting the car on the side wall of the road and the vehicle rolled over after the impact. Two tyres were detached from the car by the time it landed on the ground, said police.Fernandes, who was sitting behind Patil, had the maximum impact as the car suffered heavy damage on the driver’s side.“We rushed them to Apollo Hospital, where Fernandes died during treatment. Patil is currently critical. We have contacted their families and registered a case against Patil,” said Keshav Dinde, assistant inspector, Sanpada police station.The police have registered a case against Patil for rash driving and causing death due to negligence. It is not clear if either of them were drunk at the time of driving the car as police did not conduct a test to determine their blood alcohol levels.“There was heavy blood loss and they were rushed to the hospital. We will investigate if they were drunk and also verify the documents while conducting further probe,” Dinde added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/youth-killed-3-hurt-in-mishap-in-sanpada/story-UqO3cRM5DF4C5shW3E0KgL.html
26-06-2020||Mumbai||Psychiatrists to re-issue policy on reporting suicides||After actor Sushant Singh Rajput died by suicide, the Bombay Psychiatric Society (BPS) has criticised a section of the media for violating rules laid down by the Press Council of India (PCI) while reporting Rajput’s death. BPS plans to re-issue the media guidelines for suicide coverage.Dr Milan Balakrishnan, secretary, BPS, said on Thursday, “The media’s reporting on suicide has a huge impact on the minds of people along with the family members of the deceased. Such irresponsible coverage increases stigmatisation of people suffering from mental ailments. We request the media not to unnecessarily sensitise the death of a young actor.”Rajput died by suicide in his Bandra home on June 14. The police have found no suicide note and are currently investigating his death. Several reports published afterwards made unverified claims about the actor’s mental health and emotional state. Photos of Rajput’s dead body were also circulated on social media, which is a violation of the guidelines laid down for suicide reportage as such images are traumatic for the surviving family and can act as triggers for those who have mental health issues. City psychiatrists have widely criticised the media coverage of Rajput’s death as irresponsible, citing the guidelines laid out by the World Health Organization on how suicides should be reported by the press.In an open letter dated June 22, BPS further stated, “A number of statements have been incorrectly ascribed to him [a psychiatrist] giving the impression that doctor-patient confidentiality has been breached. Already, clarification has been issued regarding the inaccurate and distorted nature of the reporting of the concerned doctor.”Dr Balakrishnan also said that BPS plans to reissue guidelines for the media coverage suicides. “PCI has made their rules by adopting WHO guidelines. We are therefore planning to formulate one policy focusing on do-s and don’t-s for India media,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/psychiatrists-to-re-issue-policy-on-reporting-suicides/story-CD7d8lSZL8Q75esu1tJhIN.html

Each of these beaches will have a maximum of 10 shacks of the permitted size of 15ftx15ft with a 20ftx15ft shade in front of it. Tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, who thanked the cabinet for clearing his department’s proposals, tweeted, “8 beaches in Maharashtra have been approved for eco-friendly beach shacks. This will be a major tourist facility. 80% employment to locals is a must.” Transport minister and Shiv Sena leader Anil Parab said the preference to set up the shacks will be given to the local people. “Since there cannot be permanent structures coming up due to coastal regulations, we are allowing these temporary structure with licences for three years,” he said.Shacks can only come up in areas approved by the tourism directorate with permits from the State Coastal Area Management Authority, a statement issued by the government stated.The shacks can operate between 7am and 7pm and will have to follow certain restrictions. They will also have to install CCTV cameras, the statement said.Of the MTDC-run resorts which will be given on lease are located at Ganpatipule, Matheran, Mahabaleshwar, Harihareshwar, Mithbaon in the first phase. Besides the resorts, huge land parcels at Tadoba national park and Fardapur in Aurangabad are also up for grabs to private players for tourism facilities. The open land at these two places is more than 5 hectares, and the lease will be based on the interest shown by private companies.The resorts and open land will be given on 90-years lease, and rent and premium will be decided as per the existing norms issued by the high-power committee headed by the chief secretary.On the decision to lease out MTDC properties to private players, Thackeray tweeted, “This will help the state with increased revenue and most importantly build a world class tourism hospitality sector in Maharashtra with partnerships with the best hotel brands in the world.” “Land monetisation will generate employment, increase tourism footfall and revenue to the state government. The allotment will be on lease rent or through joint venture or management contracts between MTDC and private companies,” said an official from the tourism department.MTDC has already leased out 23 of its resorts and manages 27 of them at prime tourism spots, including five for which the decision was taken on Thursday. The resort in Ganpatipule has more than 100 suites and rooms, while Harihareshwar resort has the capacity of 30 rooms with high occupancy rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/8-beaches-in-state-to-get-shacks/story-Wl5iCFsrIqIg7LpNpVoVQJ.html
26-06-2020||Mumbai||Explain reasons for Covid deaths in civil hospital: Bombay HC asks Jalgaon administration||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has directed the state and district authorities to respond to a public interest litigation (PIL) that sought investigation and inquiry into the Covid-19 deaths that occurred at the civil hospital in Jalgaon. The petition claimed that the civic hospital was the only hospital in the district with a Covid-19 facility, and owing to lack of facilities and negligence by the authorities, the patients admitted there succumbed to the virus.A division bench of justices SV Gangapurwala and justice RG Avachat, while hearing the PIL filed by social worker Pratibha Shinde and two others through senior counsel Gayatri Singh and advocate Ankit Kulkarni, was informed that the death rate for Covid-19 patients in Jalgaon was 12.3%, which was the highest in Maharashtra, even as Jalgaon, Bhusawal, Amalner and Pachora areas of the district accounted for 80% of the total 112 deaths till June 4.While making submissions, Kulkarni said that Shinde and the others had lost their loved ones, as the Jalgaon district and hospital administrations had failed to provide proper care and treatment to the patients as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), central and state government guidelines. He added that even after being admitted to the hospital, the health of the patients had not been monitored, nor were routine check-ups undertaken.“There is extreme negligence, dereliction of duties and complete mismanagement on the part of the hospital and district administration, which has cost hundreds of people of Jalgaon their lives,” the petition has pointed out.Kulkarni had referred to the death of two women from the same family within nine days despite being admitted to the civil hospital, as well as the suspension of the dean and two doctors of the hospital for their negligence to drive home his point.In light of these submissions, the PIL has sought a high-level inquiry under the chairmanship of the state chief secretary into the deaths in the hospital’s Covid-19 ward and also sought compensation worth ₹50 lakh with damages for the family of the two women for negligence on part of hospital and district administration.After the state government and Jalgaon authorities sought time to respond to the plea, the bench posted the hearing for July 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/explain-reasons-for-covid-deaths-in-civil-hospital-bombay-hc-asks-jalgaon-administration/story-ca68NPsleVfPwQJIHh09KK.html
26-06-2020||City||Minor who was sexually assaulted by cousin dies||A 14-year-old girl from Badlapur, who was sexually assaulted by her cousin last week, succumbed to injuries on Thursday. The accused, a 21-year-old, had also tried to strangle her. The accused, however, is still absconding. Badlapur police had earlier booked the accused for sexual harassment and attempt to murder and now have booked him for murder and sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and sections of the Indian Penal Code.The incident took place on June 19, when the accused was alone with the minor at her home in Badlapur (East). The minor’s father, in his complaint, said the girl was found unconscious in the house and the neighbours saw the accused flee. The family claimed that the accused was with the girl for more than half-an-hour with the door locked, and added that when the neighbours called out to the minor, he panicked and ran away. The girl’s mother said, “My seven-year-old son was at home when this boy entered and asked him to leave. My son heard voice of my daughter after which he started banging on the door and called some neighbours. Almost for 15 minutes, he was inside and later he opened the door, pushed my son away and fled. I later saw my daughter was unconscious.”The police had initially registered a case of attempt to murder. However, after the family said the medical reports of the girl showed sexual assault, the charge was added. Deputy commissioner of police P Shewale confirmed that the girl has died and said, “Our teams are searching for the accused. He was last traced to Nashik. Our team has reached Nashik, but couldn’t find him. We have registered a case of murder against him and will soon be able to find him.”The minor’s mother said, “She was admitted to KEM Hospital. She opened her eyes twice and cried, but could not speak. She stopped responding for the past two to three days, and died late on Wednesday night.”According to her mother, the accused had earlier asked for the girl’s hand for marriage. They had opposed the marriage, which enraged the accused. The minor’s uncle said, “I want the police to take strict action. And if city police can’t handle the case, they should hand it over to the crime branch.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/minor-who-was-sexually-assaulted-by-cousin-dies/story-IMAkHHUjYLBRaT2yOo6JhM.html

Police have posthumously charged the woman with murder under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and are investigating further.Appasaheb Lengare, inspector, Jawhar police station, said that while they have not confirmed the motive for the murder-suicide, they suspect that poverty may have been the reason.According to police, the woman lived in a hut in Dera gaon in Jawhar with her husband, a daily-wage worker, and their two daughters aged three and seven. She and her younger daughter were missing since June 22.“Since the lockdown, the husband was unable to earn a livelihood. He was also an alcoholic,” said Lengare. “We were informed by the sarpanch that the two bodies were found near a hill, a kilometre from the woman’s hut by some tribals who had gone to collect firewood,” he added.Police have sent the bodies for post mortem to the Jawhar rural hospital and are awaiting the report.Meanwhile, ex-MLA Vivek Pandit, president of pro-tribal outfit Shramjeevi Sanghatana, who is also the chairman of the state government-appointed committee to review tribal welfare schemes, said that there was a dire need for the government to provide help to tribals during the Covid-19 lockdown. “On March 17, I had informed the government that tribals and farm labourers would die of starvation instead of Covid-19,” said Pandit.(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

26-06-2020||Mumbai||Activist seeks postponement of MLC elections||Complaining about extremely low registration of voters in Pune, Nagpur and Aurangabad graduates’ and teachers’ constituencies, a political activist from Pune has moved the Bombay high court (HC), seeking postponement of elections to the Maharashtra state Legislative Council (MLC) from these constituencies.Laxman Chavan, president of Prajasattak Bharat Paksha, has also sought a direction to the Election Commission of India (ECI) to not hold the elections till at least 50℅ of graduates from these constituencies are registered as voters.In Maharashtra, of the total 78 members of the Legislative Council, 31 are elected by members of the Legislative Assembly, 21 by elected representatives from local authorities, 12 are nominated by the Governor, and seven each are elected by graduates and teachers from Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Konkan, Aurangabad, Nagpur, and Amravati divisions.In the public interest litigation (PIL) filed through advocate Asim Sarode, Chavan pointed out that on September 5, 2016, ECI has issued clear instructions to all chief electoral officers to take special efforts to ensure that every eligible person is duly enrolled. They were ordered to facilitate the online filing of application forms, give wide publicity to the process of revision of electoral rolls, and set up special counters for collection of applications. Besides, they were also instructed to use voter registration centres for Assembly elections to get voters enrolled for the Council elections.Chavan complained that these instructions are not being followed in Maharashtra because of which the ratio of registered voters to the population of the constituencies has remained abysmally low.His petition offered Pune graduates’ constituency as an example. The population of the constituency, which comprises all five districts of Western Maharashtra, is 2.34 crore, including 1.94 crore educated individuals. However, the number of registered voters here is as low as 3.08 lakh – 1.58 ℅ of the total population.Similarly, in Nagpur constituency, barely 1.22 lakh graduates (1.23 ℅ of the total population) of 1.17 crore are registered as voters. In Aurangabad constituency, the percentage of voters is 2.48℅. Here, 3.55 lakh graduates are registered as voters, against the total population of 1.87 crore, with 1.43 crore educated individuals.The PIL adds that in 2014 when elections were held in these three constituencies, only in Nagpur, 60.14℅ of the registered voters exercised their right to vote. Aurangabad and Pune constituencies recorded a very low turnout of 34.03 ℅ and 25.78℅, respectively.Chavan also complained that hardly any efforts are made to ensure voter registration for graduates’ and teachers’ constituencies, whereas revision of voter lists for Assembly elections is almost a continuous process.He added that for the forthcoming elections, new applications were invited in January but the final list has not been published yet, despite the terms of the elected members from the three graduates’ constituencies coming to an end in July.The PIL is scheduled to come up for hearing today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/activist-seeks-postponement-of-mlc-elections/story-M4jHXU2fGCfwTgB0coDOfN.html
26-06-2020||City||Cop suspended for not filing cases against prawn thieves||Assistant police inspector (API) Raju Narwade has been suspended by Dattaray Shinde, superintendent of police (SP) Palghar, on Wednesday, for not taking cognisance of the complaints about ‘prawn thieves’. Narwade was in charge of Kelwe coastal police station which has scores of prawn farms under its jurisdiction. The officer has been suspended with immediate effect and API Mansinh Patil, formerly with the Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) of Palghar, has been given charge of Kelwe police station, said Shinde.On 16 June, a mob of around 125 men and women entered a prawn farm owned by Anant Govind Patil of Jalsar-Tembhikodave village and looted 300kg prawns worth nearly ₹1 lakh. When Patil went to lodge a complaint, API Narwade turned him away and reprimanded him for not employing security guards at his farm. He also said the police have other work to do instead of guarding prawn farms spread over 250 acres in Saphale, said a police source.In another case, a group of 16 dacoits in boats entered a prawn farm at Khardi-Dativare owned by Nachiket Patil of Pune and attacked the watchmen and other labourers at the farm with sickles, knives and stones, and stole around 65kg prawns worth around ₹60,000 on June 18. Narwade, who received a written complaint from an employee of the prawn firm, did not register an FIR.When the SP got to know about the developments, he ordered API Narwade to register a case under section 395 (dacoity) of the Indian Penal Code on June 23.

26-06-2020||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay’s autumn semester classes to be conducted online||In view of the Covid-19 outbreak in the country the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) has decided to go completely online to conduct the classes for the next semester of the new academic year.The institute’s senate on Wednesday had decided that the autumn semester will be conducted online in the interest of the students’ safety. Subhasis Chaudhuri, director, IIT-B, said that the senate’s decision to conduct online classes is applicable only for the autumn semester. “Online classes could entail classes in all possible virtual forms. The modality for each lecture will be decided by the course instructor,” said Chaudhuri.The institute has been shut since March 14, followed by the announcement of an early summer vacation from April 1 to May 31. However, owing to continuing lockdown, classes haven’t resumed yet. While the classes for the spring semester of 2020 had been concluded prior to the lockdown, the exams for the semester were pending.On May 17, the administration announced an elaborate scheme to do away with spring semester exams and promote students based on their scores of the previous semester.Now with the autumn semester set to begin soon, the institute administration is making all possible efforts to equip students for online classes.In a first-of-its-kind campaign, the administration has been raising funds through crowdsourcing to provide information technology (IT) hardware such as laptops and broadband connectivity to students from marginalised communities. The institute aims to raise ₹5 crore through donations for the purpose. “Our alumni have already provided a decent amount, but we still need more to make sure that no student is left out,” said Chaudhuri. Donors will be entitled to tax benefits under section 80G of the Income Tax Act. Meanwhile, around 70 final-year undergraduate and post-graduate students, who are currently residing in hostels due to the lockdown, have been asked to vacate the hostel premises to make room for students from the next academic year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-bombay-s-autumn-semester-classes-to-be-conducted-online/story-KJqqPDPKakEXxm7IN97WVO.html
26-06-2020||Mumbai||Crocodile rescued from Aarey; second case in 9 days||A three-foot female sub-adult crocodile weighing 2.72 kg was rescued from an artificial pond near Royal Palms in Aarey Colony, Goregaon on Wednesday. On June 15, a one-foot juvenile marsh crocodile weighing 700 grams was rescued from the same spot, making this the second rescue within a span of nine days. Marsh crocodiles are protected under schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972The wildlife rescue team, NGO Wildlife Welfare Association (WWA), said the area was an abandoned construction site near one of the bungalows at Royal Palms where an excavated area was converted into a 10 to 12-foot-deep artificial pond.“We set up a trap on Tuesday night by placing fishing nets by dividing the pond into three sections. On Wednesday, as the crocodile moved closer to the surface of the pond, it got trapped,” said Aditya Patil, president, WWA. “The reptile was safely rescued using a grasper net and was found healthy after a medical check-up.”Forest officials said both the crocodiles were kept under observation at Thane Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (TSPCA). “They will be released in the wild soon,” said Jitendra Ramgaonkar, deputy conservator of forest, Thane.WWA members said this may be a case of pet trade wherein hatchlings were picked up from nearby crocodile habitats and kept in isolated areas to be illegally sold. “This unethical relocation has been spotted across parts of Mumbai and Thane over the years where crocs have been seized. Better monitoring of source habitats such as Vihar, Tulsi, and Powai lakes is needed,” said Patil.Ramgaonkar, however, said the department has not come to any conclusions yet. Range forest officer (Mumbai) Santosh Kank said, “We are investigating whether these reptiles are using pipelines to move or are naturally pushed to such areas as lakes swell during monsoon. However, relocation by humans is ruled out.”Herpetologist Kedar Bhide had a similar view. “Our work in Savitri river, Mahad (Raigad) has shown crocodile dispersal as far as 3km to isolated ponds. So this is possible from Vihar or Tulsi lakes to Aarey. There are less chances of them being relocated by people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/crocodile-rescued-from-aarey-second-case-in-9-days/story-sI1i0O2Ene6BfV5rmyVxmM.html
26-06-2020||City||Stay on Navi Mumbai civic commissioner’s transfer order?||In a major twist, Navi Mumbai municipal commissioner Annasaheb Misal on Thursday said his transfer order has been cancelled.The state on Tuesday had issued transfer orders for Misal and some other municipal commissioners amid the rapid surge in Covid-19 cases. The order stated that Misal would be replaced by 2008 batch India Administrative Services (IAS) officer Abhijit Bangar. Bangar reportedly came to Navi Mumbai on Wednesday to take charge, but returned after the transfer was stayed. Confirming the development, Misal said, “I never went anywhere, so there is no question on being back. I will continue to take measures to fight the Covid-19 outbreak in the city which is witnessing rising cases.”Sources privy to the development claim that there is a political angle to the stay on the transfer. “There was unhappiness among certain sections about the new appointment. Thus, there were efforts on the political front to stop the transfer,” a source said.According to another source, Misal pointed out to his superiors that he had taken charge only 11 months ago in July last year and it would be injustice to transfer him in a short span of time. “We will take up contact-tracing and conduct rapid tests. We will also strictly implement the norms in containment zones to ensure there is social distancing. I urge all residents to cooperate with us,” the civic commissioner said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stay-on-navi-mumbai-civic-commissioner-s-transfer-order/story-27kacnxzHQQt3Ff28B0OGI.html
26-06-2020||Mumbai||‘20 workers at Deonar waste treatment unit had to resign over discrimination’||With the outbreak of Covid-19, a major issue for the city has been the management of biomedical and associated waste. Fear of infection has led to frontline workers being stigmatised and 20 sanitation workers at the common biomedical waste treatment facility (CBWFT) in Deonar quit following discrimination from neighbours. The CBWFT incinerates all Covid-19 and non Covid-19 biomedical waste (BMW), which is managed as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) protocol.Covid-19 waste includes used masks, head and shoe covers, disposable gowns and coveralls as well as associated waste, like leftover food, disposable plates and used tissues of Covid-19 patients.All of the city’s Covid-19 waste passes through the Deonar landfill before reaching private operator SMS Envocare for incineration. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officers said the landfill is operating a no-contact approach followed by deep burial. Daily, 140 vehicles dump waste at Deonar. They are sprayed with sodium hypochlorite solution when they enter the site. Sandesh Lanke, sub-engineer at Deonar, said each day, least two pits that are 10-12-foot deep and 25 feet wide are dug by labourers. Vehicles dump the waste in the pits and then cover the pits with debris. “This way we avoid any contamination,” said Lanke, adding that Covid-19 tests and thermal screening are carried out regularly. So far, two security guards and six labourers at the landfill have tested positive for the Sars-Cov-2 virus, but all of them have recovered and reported duty again, said Lanke.SMS Envocare, appointed by BMC to collect and incinerate the city’s daily waste, received 9 tons of Covid-19 waste and 6 tons of associated biomedical waste between June 1 and June 14. “From June 15-June 25, this waste increased to 12 tons for Covid-19 waste and 8 tons of BMW,” said Anup Nilawar, director, SMS Envocare.Nilawar said no SMS Envocare workers had contracted Covid-19 and confirmed that 20 frontline sanitation workers had quit in the past two months. “Some quit for fear of contracting the virus. Most workers have concealed that they work at a waste treatment facility. However, those who disclosed their profession faced a major backlash, which has been demoralising, especially as they are the real Covid-19 warriors,” said Nilawar.SMS Envocare said it is spending over Rs. 1 lakh per day, over and above their daily operational cost. “We started a separate Covid-19 allowance for all 386 workers. We have increased daily wages, providing incentives and purchasing additional PPE kits,” said Nilawar. “Those doing overtime are also given special allowances daily. All workers are regularly being counselled and daily health check-ups are organised.”CPCB has urged citizens to help with waste segregation to minimise risk of environmental damage. “We are asking citizens to cut their masks, face shields, gloves etc. into pieces and collect as a part of the dry waste itself. This will go to the waste-to-energy plant in Kanjurmarg and very little, if at all, will be sent to the Deonar landfill,” said B Vinod Babu, nodal officer, CPCB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/20-workers-at-deonar-waste-treatment-unit-had-to-resign-over-discrimination/story-AaVcOCymo2U6gmFSqUheHK.html
26-06-2020||Mumbai||Central team to visit Maharashtra, Gujarat, Telangana to chalk out new Covid management plan||The Centre will send a team of experts to three big states — Maharashtra, Gujarat and Telangana — that have emerged as key concerns in the Centre’s Covid-19 management plan.The team will visit Maharashtra on Friday, Gujarat on Saturday and spend the next two days in Telangana. India’s worst-affected state, Maharashtra, is reporting an average of 3,500 new cases and analysts believe it will soon become the first state with 1.5 lakh Covid-19 cases. The state’s total cases till Wednesday stood at 1,42,900.While Maharashtra’s silver lining is that the case doubling rate now stands at 23 days, its fatality rate however is 3.7 — much higher than the national average.Unlike the previous tour, the national team of experts will not concentrate on Mumbai, but tour the districts of Pune, Thane and Palghar. “These three districts have seen a sudden rise in the number of cases. The central team will assist in plugging the loopholes and help the state formulate new strategies, if required,” said an official.Also read | 3 more cops die of Covid-19 in Maharashtra, force’s death toll climbs to 54After Maharashtra, the team will go to Gujarat and will tour Ahmedabad, among other areas. According to the government data, Gujarat has been reporting about 530 new cases everyday and has a fatality rate of 6%. “Ahmedabad is a cause for concern,” another official said.Meanwhile, Telangana, which tested at a slow pace initially, has now picked up the testing rate. The state now reports an average of 550 cases per day, but has the quickest doubling rate among the three states.“Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra are getting doubled in 23 days, while Gujarat takes 33 days for cases to double. However, in Telangana, cases are doubling in just 8.5 days,” said another official.The Centre has told all the states to not shy away from reporting high Covid-19 figures, but the implementation of health norms, including social distance, proper sealing of containment zones, use of masks, should be proper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/central-team-to-visit-thane-and-palghar-to-chalk-out-new-plans/story-8KSM1giTyFAk8IjdwKnWtO.html

26-06-2020||Mumbai||Realty sales in Mumbai Metropolitan Region dip 74% this quarter, reveals survey||Not a single realty project was launched in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) in the second quarter (April to June) of the year owing to the Covid-19 outbreak and the ensuing lockdown. The sales in the region, too, saw a decline of 74% from the previous quarter (January to March) and 83% from the second quarter of 2019, a survey conducted by real estate consultancy firm ANAROCK Property Consultants revealed.Many real estate experts termed this period as one of the worst phases in the history of the sector. “A massive drop both in new launches as well as in home sales was expected owing to a complete lockdown for most of this quarter,” said Anuj Puri, chairman of ANAROCK. Puri said 3,620 properties were sold across MMR this quarter, but their deals were fixed before the lockdown and only formalities were completed in these three months. This a sharp decline from the 13,910 apartments sold in the region in the first quarter.According to the Builders Association of India (BAI), it was not possible for any developer to launch a project in the April-June period. “There was a massive negative sentiment [in the market] and all activities were paralysed. Our own offices were shut and there was no way we could have arranged site visits for homebuyers,” said Anand Gupta, committee member, BAI. He added that there would be fewer launches in the coming months too, owing to the weak economic conditions. “We are seeing job retrenchments and salary cuts. In such a scenario, a prospective homebuyer will not prefer taking a plunge and hence builders will be very cautious over launching new projects,” said Gupta. According to Puri, instead of new launches, builders will be focusing on completing their ongoing projects.The sector has been plagued by slowdown in the past few years, with buyers finding it difficult to buy properties owing to the exorbitant pricing. With the lockdown, the situation has worsened for the sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/realty-sales-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region-dip-74-this-quarter-reveals-survey/story-oYgTGph74lNlMgH0Z0CozN.html
26-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s civic hospitals see a rise in vacant beds||With the gradual dip in Covid-19 cases in the city, the number of vacant beds has jumped by 18 percentage points, compared to the first week of June, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) data. Also, civic-run hospitals are reporting a gradual decrease in critically ill Covid-19 patients.On June 6, a total of 9,092 beds were reserved for Covid-19 patients in Dedicated Covid Hospitals (DCH) and Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHC). Of these, 8,570 beds were occupied and 522 were vacant. Anticipating a rise in cases, BMC increased the bed strength by over 3,000 in the past 18 days. Currently, BMC has 12,130 beds in these hospitals, of which 2,923 beds are available.“With faster recovery rate and considerably fewer cases, more beds are available now. Many patients, especially those who are on ventilator support, were admitted earlier,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, part of the state’s Covid-19 task force. A majority of the vacant beds are in the intensive care unit (ICU), the capacity of which was recently increased to 1,362 from 1,102 beds. HT had reported how only nine ICU beds were available in the first week of June. As of June 24, 108 ICU beds (7.9%) are available.Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital, Parel, said 25% of their total beds are currently unoccupied, up from zero vacancy on June 6. This despite the civic hospital receiving a majority of critical patients.Similarly, Dr Ramesh Bharmal, in-charge of Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, also known as Sion Hospital, said the pressure has reduced. “The situation is better than earlier when we were struggling to arrange for beds. Now, we have 30-40 beds vacant on a daily basis,” he said. Data from BMC shows that 5,901 patients are on beds with oxygen facilities, compared to 3,424 such patients on June 6.Explaining the surge, Dr Akash Khobragade, medical superintendent of the government-run St George Hospital, said, “Mild and moderate patients with breathing difficulties are usually kept on oxygen support. As the number of such cases has increased, they are occupying more beds with oxygen support, which in a way a good sign as the fatality rate among them is the lowest.”Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, a public health expert, however, said there was no uniformity in the availability of beds. The crisis of beds is getting more severe towards suburbs such as Kandivli and Borivli, where cases are gradually increasing. “The cases in south Mumbai have plateaued, but it hasn’t happened all across the city. Now, the load of patients has increased in suburban areas where hospitals like Shatabdi and Bhagwati are struggling to meet the demand,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-civic-hospitals-see-a-rise-in-vacant-beds/story-e04Qa8VLgkWE8p4sUCatuK.html

In April, a bench of the Aurangabad HC had taken cognisance of the plight of migrant workers who were forced to undertake long journeys on foot to reach their hometowns after they lost their sources of income in Aurangabad and adjoining districts due to the lockdown. The court had initiated the suo motu PIL and appointed advocate Amol Joshi to inform the court of the suffering of migrant workers and the needy. The Aurangabad district administration was also directed to initiate immediate measures to address the issue.While the district administration set up temporary shelters to house migrants and needy persons where they were provided with basic essentials, medical facilities and protective gear, it came to light that health workers were being harassed by locals residents who feared that they may spread the virus.The administration informed the court that all the migrants had been put on the trains arranged by the state and sent back home and that the shelter homes were vacant.The bench had also directed the district administration to provide protection to doctors and health workers. Following this, local politicians and nongovernment organisations were roped in and health workers and doctors were provided with personal protective equipment.After hearing the submissions made by the authorities related to migrant and health workers, the court stated that the purpose of PIL was served and disposed of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-disposes-pil-after-all-migrant-workers-from-aurangabad-sent-back-home/story-oajs0UM9Nbc4mMH8ZXyc0I.html

26-06-2020||Chandigarh||GMCH, PGI have no plans to resume OPD services||With no immediate plans to resume OPD services, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, is focusing on providing tele-consultation services to patients.The Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has also yet to decide on reopening its OPDs.In a press release, GMCH authorities said, “Although it is impractical to start the routine OPD services due to the pandemic, keeping in mind the patients’ needs, GMCH is committed to providing consultation to non-Covid patients through telemedicine and consultation facility.”The daily consultation in different clinics through telemedicine is provided to approximately 200 patients every day from 9.30am to 1pm, except on Sunday and gazetted holidays. Since April 28, more than 2,300 patients have availed of these services. Among them, 30.2% were fresh registrations and 69.7% old patients. “Most patients, 1,090 (47.3%), are from Chandigarh, followed by Punjab at 691 (30.0%) and Haryana at 397 (17.2%),” said Dr BS Chavan, director-principal, GMCH. “The functioning of telemedicine facility is a wise step to avoid congregation of patients at the hospital and ensures social distancing. It is also saving patients from unnecessary commute. As per the feedback received, the patients who are unable to visit the hospital due to Covid outbreak are finding these services very useful. Those who are found to require either physical examination or admission are being advised to report to the hospital,” the hospital spokesperson said. Meanwhile, PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said, “We will take the decision to reopen the OPDs once the graph of Covid cases drops. Abruptly opening OPDs will lead to huge rush of patients and social distancing norms will go for a toss.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gmch-pgi-have-no-plans-to-resume-opd-services/story-229fJ1FzOjLSH54zQ0FK8O.html

26-06-2020||City||At Rs 74.02/litre, diesel rate touches all-time high in Mohali||With diesel rates touching an all-time high of Rs 74.02 per litre in Mohali on Thursday, after a hike on the 18th consecutive day, petrol pump owners in the district were hit hard as their sales dipped due to the lower rates in the adjoining cities of Chandigarh and Panchkula.The rate of diesel in Chandigarh was Rs 71.34 per litre while in Panchkula, it was Rs 72.02.The petrol rate was ₹81.69 per litre in Mohali, Rs 77.14 per litre in Chandigarh and Rs 77.81 per litre in Panchkula.The effective value added tax, including cess, is 33.40% in Mohali, while in Chandigarh, it is 22.45% with no additional cess. In Panchkula, the VAT is 26.25%.Mohali district petroleum dealers association president Ashwinder Singh Mongia said, “Due to the difference in fuel rates, we have lost about 80% of our business. Dealers whose pumps are on the UT-Punjab border are the worst hit as due to availability of cheaper fuel just 2-3km away, people don’t go to them.”“When authorities can bring parity in liquor rates, why can’t they bring uniformity in fuel rates,” he asked.A petrol pump owner in Mohali, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Even in the national capital region, there is a fuel rate difference of just 25 paisa, despite the area being heavily populated and having a huge geographical area, including parts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.”UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “Instead of asking us to increase VAT, dealers should ask Punjab and Haryana governments to slash the rates. We follow the instructions of the government of India and our motive is to benefit the consumers. We had recently increased the VAT to 22.45%.”Dealers in Mohali and Panchkula also resent the Chandigarh petrol pump owners for putting up boards and hoardings advertising the cheaper rates. They claim that the boards are illegal and questioned why the Chandigarh administration, which is usually very strict, has allowed such boards to stand.A senior official of the Punjab excise and taxation department said, “Since Mohali is part of Punjab, we cannot differentiate rates here from the rest of the state. Efforts were made, but still there is no parity in fuel prices. This is due to the different policies of the state and UT administration.”MOHALI SALES DROPAs per the record of Mohali district petroleum dealers association, sales in Mohali has dropped 42% from 15,000 kl per month in August 2016 to 9,200 kl in March 2020. In the corresponding period, Chandigarh doubled its diesel sale to 18,180kl from 8,883kl per month. In Panchkula, sales have dipped 40% from 10,000 litres per day per petrol pump in 2016 to 6,000 litres per day in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-rs-74-02-litre-diesel-rate-touches-all-time-high-in-mohali/story-F7ynM87arm31cILOc6gKFO.html

26-06-2020||Mumbai||Maha set for more relaxations as 4,841 virus cases added in 24 hrs||Days before the fifth phase of the lockdown comes to an end on June 30, the state government is set to extend a few more industrial-commercial relaxations under its ‘Mission Begin Again’, even as it recorded its highest single-day spike of 4,841 coronavirus cases.An order issued late on Thursday stated that the barber shops, salons and beauty parlours in 19 municipal corporations earmarked as red zones, will open from June 28, while in the rest of the state they shall open from June 27. The order stated that the establishments can carry out select services like haircut, hair dyeing, waxing, threading, among others, excluding skin-related services. The state government has also made it mandatory for employees to wear protective gear such as gloves, aprons and masks, and that the workspace (chair) should be sanitised after every customer. Making sanitisation of the shop mandatory every two hours, the order said use of disposable towels, napkins is a must. Sterilisation and sanitisation of non-disposable items every time has also been made compulsory. They have also been mandated to entertain customers with prior appointments and putting up the notice describing the rules prominently in the premises. On Thursday, Maharashtra’s daily fresh infections for the first time crossed the 4,000 mark, taking the tally to 147,741. Of them, 63,342 are active cases, according to the state health department. The state also reported 192 deaths, taking the toll to 6,931. Mumbai, the worst-hit city across the country, crossed the 70,000 mark for cases with 1,350 new infections, pushing the count to 70,878. The city toll stands at 4,062 after 98 deaths were reported.Also read | 3 more cops die of Covid-19 in Maharashtra, force’s death toll climbs to 54Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray during the cabinet meeting on Thursday said that salons will be allowed to operate from Sunday. Although the cabinet also discussed permitting gymnasiums to open, no final decision has yet been taken on this. Mumbai’s guardian minister Aslam Shaikh said that the decision over gymnasiums will be taken next week, while the standard operating procedure for salons will be issued in next couple of days.“We are allowing salons to operate from Sunday, for both genders . Both the customer and the employee will have to wear masks and follow distancing rules. We are allowing these establishments to open, but we will assess the situation and take decisions for further activities,” said transport minister and Shiv Sena leader Anil Parab.The state government is expected to allow private offices to operate with 25-30% of its staff, up from existing permission of 10% of staff from July 1. The state government, however, is not in any mood to allow train services for non-essential services or operate interstate public transport.Shaikh said, “Opening of the salon industry, too, was important as the small shopkeepers and their employees are suffering heavy losses and hardship. After a couple of suicides by salon shopkeepers, I had demanded opening of these shops by writing a letter to the CM. The SOP to be issued by the government will elaborate on the guidelines to be followed by the shops and customers.”Parab said that the decision about allowing more transport services in public and private sector will be taken after a meeting of the high-power taskforce, in consultation with the chief minister and deputy chief minister.A decision over interdistrict transportation is expected to be taken in the next couple of days. Currently, public transport is allowed within districts in non-red zones areas, which are the areas other than the 19 municipal corporations. The state government is expected to allow intra-district transportation in non-red zones.Also read | Nearly 17,000 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours push India’s tally to over 4.7 lakhParab said that since local train services for public were not possible to be allowed in near future, they were ensuring adequate transport facilities in the wake of more relaxations to the industrial and commercial activities. “Additional transport facilities will be required after easing out more restrictions on industrial-commercial activities. We have a consignment of essentials arriving at JNPT, but their offloading is not taking place for want of auxiliary services. The decision over relaxations to industries will be taken in due course. A taskforce appointed for the transport industry will decide on its operations and safety measures in the wake of pandemic,” he said.Containment zones and cities like Mumbai, Thane and Pune, which have high caseload, may continue with industrial curbs for few more weeks, said an official from the government.(with inputs from Faisal Malik)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-set-for-more-relaxations-as-4-841-virus-cases-added-in-24-hrs/story-W4gOWzfhjfRmYg6jzBKlaK.html

Sonepat superintendent of police Jashandeep Randhawa said Jasbir told them that he fled to Gujarat from Jhajjar on April 30 after he was transferred to the Police Lines when his name surfaced in the case. “He told the SIT he had travelled in a taxi and got support throughout. Jasbir said that he had also bought a new phone and a sim card while on the run,” he added. “During this period, kingpin Bhupinder Singh’s brother Jitender remained in regular touch with him via phone. He also arranged for the suspended SHO’s stay. Names of four liquor traders also cropped up on the first day of Jasbir’s remand,” the SP said.Randhawa said they were trying to identify other people who might have helped him. A cop privy to the development, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The SHO has revealed that he had been involved in the scam for past 18 months, but got exposed during the lockdown.”The SIT had caught Jasbir Singh from Rohtak on Wednesday and produced him in a local court that sent him in five-day police remand. It may be mentioned here that 5,500 boxes of liquor had gone missing from the godown owned by Bhupinder Singh’s mother early in May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/missing-liquor-case-kingpin-s-brother-helped-suspended-kharkhauda-sho-in-fleeing-say-police/story-CIfXeRCemCqxcfltiD2QTM.html
26-06-2020||Chandigarh||AGRI ORDINANCES: Badals betrayed Punjabis, abandoned ideology: Balbir Sidhu||Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu on Thursday accused the Badal family of betraying the interests of the state and the farmers by supporting the “anti-Punjab” agriculture ordinances passed by the Centre.In a statement, Sidhu claimed the central ordinances not only encroached upon the rights of the states but their implementation would also pave the way for the abolition of the ongoing marketing system which is ensuring the procurement of crops at minimum support price (MSP). “(Shiromani Akali Dal president) Sukhbir Singh Badal was well aware that these ordinances would damage the economy of the state but he turned his back on the farmers of the state only in the lure of a ministry,” he said.As per the Constitution of India, the subject of agriculture solely lies with the states and by issuing these ordinances the central government has violated the Constitution of India and its original spirit, the minister said. “This is not the first time that the SAD leadership abandoned its old agenda of giving autonomy to the states and supported the decisions of the Narendra Modi government which undermined the rights of the states. The Akali Dal had also supported the decision to split Jammu and Kashmir into three union territories,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/agri-ordinances-badals-betrayed-punjabis-abandoned-ideology-balbir-sidhu/story-GfQtYkILQoTcQbERGrvjBP.html
26-06-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Punjab’s doubling rate drops by half to 18 days in 3 weeks||The recent spate of Covid-19 cases in Punjab has led to a drastic drop in the doubling rate of infection to almost by half from 34 days on June 1 to 18 days on June 22. Since the beginning of this month, as many as 1,934 fresh cases of infection were reported in the state, taking the total tally from 2,301 on June 1 to 4,235 on June 22. As per the daily Covid-19 analysis report prepared by the state health department, Punjab’s doubling rate is worse than Maharashtra, one of the worst-hit states, where cases are now doubling in 23.8 days. The national doubling rate is 19.5 days. However, the state’s rate is better than neighbouring Haryana and the national capital where cases are now getting two-fold in 13.6 and 12.8 days. Doubling rate is the number of days it takes for the cases to get twofold based on the growth rate of last seven days. Among all the districts, Jalandhar, which has the second highest number of infections in the state, has the fastest doubling rate where cases are getting twofold in just 10 days. The Ludhiana district, with the third highest number of cases, is second in terms of doubling rate at 11.9 days. In the week preceding June 22, maximum 217 new cases were detected in the Jalandhar district followed by 194 in Ludhiana and 153 in Amritsar. The Amritsar district, which has the highest number of cases, has a doubling rate of 22.4 days followed by Mohali (21.6), Patiala (20.6), Pathankot (18.7), Barnala (14.8), Sangrur (14.5), Kapurthala (13.5), Ferozepur (13.5) and Fazilka (12). The SBS Nagar district, which was declared the state’s first Covid-19 hotspot, now has the slowest doubling rate of 118.9 days. ‘CASES INCREASING AT AN IDENTICAL PACE’Experts say the figures indicate that cases are increasing in most of the districts now almost at an identical pace.But the state health authorities attribute the increase in cases to increase in testing. “Ramping up of the testing capacity and a rigorous contact tracing of patients are the reason behind increase in cases. Besides, people are not following social-distancing norms,” said Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.The data shows that the state’s testing per million on June 21 was 7,926, ahead of Karnataka (7,492), Haryana (7,332) and Maharashtra (6,243). India’s testing per million is 5,054.From June 1 to June 21, Punjab was next only to West Bengal and Tamil Nadu in terms of increasing the testing capacity, shows the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) data.

26-06-2020||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal hails Lok Nayak hospital’s services in Covid fight||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday inaugurated a video-calling facility for patients at Lok Nayak hospital, the city’s largest dedicated Covid-19 facility. Commending the hospital after it completed 100 days as a Covid-designated facility, Kejriwal said the Delhi government would work with the staff and administration to ensure any shortcomings were overcome.“Lok Nayak hospital has completed 100 days of treatment of Covid-19 patients. This is the biggest Covid-19 hospital in the country and over the past 100 days, 2,700 patients with severe symptoms have recovered and gone home. The doctors and staff have worked without worrying about their own health. They are doing a great job. Lok Nayak has started providing plasma therapy on a larger scale now, which has helped in reducing the deaths reported from the hospital,” Kejriwal said.The video-call service would help patients get in touch with their family members.To demonstrate how the video calling facility would help, Kejriwal went on to make video calls to a few patients and sought to know if they were satisfied with the treatment and services they were being given.Sharing an image of his video interaction with an elderly woman, Kejriwal tweeted, “relatives of Corona patients admitted at Lok Nayak Hospital will now be able to speak to them”.The need for a video calling facility was felt after many complained that they couldn’t talk to their critically ill relatives for days on end or get an update on their condition, a Delhi government spokesperson said.Also read | Delhi records 3,390 Covid-19 cases, widens undesired lead over MumbaiThe video calling facility will be offered with the help of 33 tablets, 31 of which have been placed in the Covid wards, and two at the help desk, Dr Suresh Kumar, the hospital’s medical director, said.During an interaction with the chief minister, the hospital’s medical director Dr Suresh Kumar said deaths resulting from Covid-19 have reduced at the Lok Nayak hospital, ever since various modes of treatment such as plasma therapy and the steroid dexamethasone were introduced.“The mortality rate recorded at the hospital fluctuates between 2.5% and 3.5% from week to week (since the hospital was turned into a Covid-19 facility). Although the data is yet to be analysed, we have seen a reduction in the number of deaths after various therapies were adopted by the hospital,” Kumar said.Later, when asked by HT, the hospital said it was not at liberty to share the number of deaths reported from the hospital. The hospital had administered plasma therapy to 29 Covid-19 patients during the phase 1 trial of the therapy in April, after it became the first government hospital in India to receive approval for the therapy. Also read | Delhi L-G reverses Covid order on home isolation after meeting CM KejriwalThe hospital received approval for phase 2 of the trial, with 200 patients, last week and nine patients have already been administered the therapy, which uses a blood component from people who have recovered from the infection that is rich in virus-fighting antibodies. This blood is administered to Covid-19 patients to boost their immunity. The government has created a plasma bank of 200 units at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences.“The plasma therapy seems to help Covid-19 patients and fewer patients on this therapy go on to get severe symptoms as compared to a control group not receiving the therapy. We have also got a plasmapheresis machine at Lok Nayak and we are trying to persuade people who have recovered from the infection to donate plasma for use by others,”Kumar said. Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain, who is recovering from the Covid-19, was also administered the therapy at a private hospital after a pneumonia patch in his lung started expanding.Apart from plasma therapy, the hospital has also completed a pilot study of the drug Tocilizumab. It is a monoclonal antibody (a laboratory created molecule that mimics the antibodies needed to fight Covid-19). Those with moderate symptoms are given the medicine on admission and the progression of the disease is evaluated against an equal number of control patients who did not receive the medicine, Kumar explained.The hospital said the trial data would be released after it is duly published in a scientific journal.The hospital will soon conduct trials on the antiviral drugs remdesivir and favipiravir, the medical director confirmed.With Delhi reporting over 3,000 cases a day, the hospital has provided oxygen support on all 2,000 beds. The hospital has also increased its ICU beds to 100 and is working on further increasing it to 500, according to the medical director. Currently, 718 of the 2,000 beds and 56 of the 100 ventilator-facility beds at the hospital are occupied, according to the Delhi Corona App.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-hails-lok-nayak-hospital-s-services-in-covid-fight/story-qy8ixGUto2fUHtOu9pKvrK.html
26-06-2020||Delhi||Officials, residents laud reversal of isolation SOP in Delhi||District administration officials, residents’ welfare groups and health experts on Thursday welcomed the reversal of an order that had made it mandatory for every individual testing Covid-19 positive in a swab test to be taken to a Covid Care Centre (CCC) for aclinical assessment of the symptoms.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), chaired by lieutenant-governor (L-G) Anil Baijal restored the old system on Thursday whereby health officials will first establish contact with the patient through telephone, inquire about symptoms and then send a team to the residence of patients, following which a call is taken on whether the individual remains in home isolation or is shifted to a hospital/quarantine centre.The new rule of mandatory visits to CCC for clinical assessment was put into effect on Monday, when the director-general of health services (DGHS) of Delhi notified the L-G’s directions, till it was revoked on Thursday after a meeting of the DDMA.While the Delhi government vehemently opposed the L-G’s order, saying it would lead to chaos, at least 50 residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) too had written to Anil Baijal on Wednesday urging him to withdraw the order. The RWAs had said instead of asking every patient to go to CCCs, which involved the risk of spreading the infection, the government should start tele-consultation services for asymptomatic and mild patients. Several district revenue officials, in charge of the implementation of all covid-related policies and standard procedures in their districts, on Thursday said Monday’s direction had given rise to a logistical nightmare.The implementation of the rule required that the city’s 163 dedicated Covid ambulances to make an average of 18 trips every day ferrying people from their homes to CCCs.“This was impossible. We had started implementing the guidelines but there was huge resistance from the people. The ones with mild symptoms did not want to go to Covid centres at all. We were wasting a lot of time in making them understand that this was no longer a choice but a rule,” a district magistrate, who did not wish to be identified, said.The crisis was such that at least two districts had even written to the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) asking for buses for transportation of patients. A few other districts had hired private vans for the purpose. Another district magistrate, again not wishing to be named, said, “We did our best to implement the rule. We succeeded to some extent over the past four days, but we were not sure for how long we could have carried on with things as they were. The revocation of the order is a big relief.”With the guidelines now revoked, district officials said they can focus on strengthening surveillance teams, ramping up health care infrastructure and carrying out two major surveys, which have tight deadlines. One is the health screening of residents in 260-odd containment zones of the city that needs to be completed by June 30, and the other is a comprehensive health survey of the rest of Delhi that needs to be completed by July 7, as per the recommendations of Union home minister Amit Shah, later notified by the DGHS through an order issued on Monday.After Thursday’s decision, Baijal also emphasised on developing a “robust surveillance mechanism by Delhi’s health department.”Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Safdarjung hospital, said, “The mandatory visits to CCCs had two issues. First, it was a logistical nightmare. Second, it increased chances of local transmission. The districts can now focus on strengthening the health care system and better surveillance.”Also read | Delhi records 3,390 Covid-19 cases, widens undesired lead over MumbaiResident welfare groups said the reversal would calm down anxieties and motivate more people to get tested.“People were fearing the idea of being sent to Covid centres, even for a clinical assessment. But the government must ensure that their health officials visit each patient’s house in time. We have come across a lot of complaints that this is not the case and the government should take note of that,” BS Vohra, president of the federation of resident welfare associations in east Delhi, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/officials-residents-laud-reversal-of-isolation-sop-in-delhi/story-6gJBuOvSFcjdN0DFBFVOpJ.html
26-06-2020||Delhi||Social distancing goes for a toss at Delhi’s RML testing centre||A middle-aged man’s repeated coughs while answering queries at the registration counter of RML Hospital’s Covid testing centre draws a sharp reaction from Ramesh Nand, who is standing a few spots behind him. The seemingly ill man has coughed right into the speaker installed on the glass shield that separates patients from the staff jotting down details.“You’ll infect even those who are healthy,” 45-year-old Nand tells the man, who has symptoms and is getting himself tested. Nand, a resident of west Delhi’s Janakpuri, is at this central Delhi hospital to get his cousin tested for Covid-19.“I have left my cousin in the car and standing in his place in the queue. It is better I get infected than have my diabetic cousin risk his life in this queue,” Nand said.Also read | Delhi records 3,390 Covid-19 cases, widens undesired lead over MumbaiAt RML Hospital’s testing centre, which has been testing 400 Covid-19 patients every day since early June, social distancing barely exists. There isn’t anyone to enforce distancing either at this screening centre, the busiest in Delhi. On Thursday afternoon, over three dozen patients and their relatives stood closely behind each other in two queues or huddled together at different spots in a small space covered by a green fibre roof.BUSIEST SCREENING CENTRELocated near Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, this central government-run hospital has 157 beds for Covid patients, of which 146 (93%) were occupied as of 5.20pm on Thursday, according to the Delhi Corona app. Among government hospitals, only Safdarjung Hospital, with close to 98% occupancy, has a greater availability to occupancy ratio of beds in Delhi.The hospital is equipped with 14 ventilators for Covid patients, of which three were in use as on Thursday evening. Overall, this hospital has about 1,500 beds RML was the first to be recognised as Covid-19 treatment facility in Delhi and has been the busiest screening centre. It was also the first hospital to detect a Covid positive patient on March 2.The hospital tests around 400 people every day. Its timing was reduced to 9am-5pm since early June until when it would offer round-the-clock testing services. According to hospital authorities, the RT-PCR machine in the hospital has a capacity of 350 samples a day, which was stretched to 400.The testing centre receives samples from symptomatic as well as asymptomatic patients and those who need to get Covid test done before undergoing treatment and surgeries for non-Covid ailments.NON-COVID PATIENTS AT RISKIt were the asymptomatic and non-Covid patients who complained the most about non-existent social distancing.Surender Kumar, a 61-year-old heart patient who has been visiting the hospital for the last seven years and has a pacemaker, lay on a stretcher on one corner of this testing space for over two hours even as his son kept walking in and out of the queue. “For admission to the emergency ward of the hospital, we have been asked to get tested for Covid. My father hardly has any symptoms of Covid, but now I am worried he’ll contact the disease going through the process,” said his son, Arun Kumar. His father is here to get himself admitted after chest pain.Kumar pointed to the process one has to go through before submitting the swab for tests.Patients have to note down details such as phone and Aadhaar numbers on a paper and hold it in front of them so that the staff can see them. But most people were seen putting the paper against the glass shield.Also read | Delhi L-G reverses Covid order on home isolation after meeting CM KejriwalThe patients are required to answer a few queries in another queue. A speaker fixed to the glass shield facilities the conversations.Most patients placed their mouths within inches of the speaker to be audible. A few literally stuck their mouths in it.“We have taken all precautions at home to ensure social distancing, but we are exposed to infection at a place where the most caution should have been taken,” said Mahesh Kumar, nephew of a 48-year-old Pushpa who lay on another stretcher nearby.Pushpa has no symptoms of Covid, but needs to take the test which is required before she undergoes a surgery for a backbone fracture she suffered a week ago.‘WILL MOVE TO A SPACIOUS AREA’Dr Minakshi Bhardwaj, medical superintendent of the hospital, said efforts were on to sensitise people about the need to maintain social distancing. “We have tried positing more guards but the situation is similar. The people themselves have to understand the importance of social distance and maintain it in the form of a serpentine line or separate queue,” said Bhardwaj. The MS said efforts are on to move the screening centre to a more spacious area in the next 10 to 15 days.Lying on stretchers, Pushpa and Kumar were still luckier than most other patients and their relatives.Tek Chand, a 78-year-old man who was here with his wife for the test, sat at a gap of one chair from each other even as people ahead and behind them stood close to each other.The elderly couple had decided to take the test because their neighbour had tested positive.“We know it is futile to attempt social distancing but we are trying. There is a high chance these steel chairs are infected, but we just want to be sure that there was no compromise from our end,” said Chand.Some patients and relatives sat under trees nearby or in their cars while waiting for their chance.Then there was 37-year-old Naseema Begum who stayed far away from queue even as her daughter, Noor, tended to her.“I have severe cough and breathing problems, so I am staying away from others so that they don’t get infected. But there should have been a separate section for the people with no signs of infection,” Begum said.The lone visible security guard, meanwhile, sat in one corner without bothering anyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/social-distancing-goes-for-a-toss-at-rml-testing-centre/story-ig9Opy3jFeOSmW7YLGSXaP.html
26-06-2020||Delhi||Students, schools happy but confused after CBSE cancels exams||The Central Board of Secondary Education’s (CBSE) decision to cancel the pending board examinations for classes 10 and 12, which were scheduled to take place from July 1 amid the Covid-19 pandemic, came as a relief to students, parents and schools but it left some concerned over how the alternative assessments mechanism and college admissions will work.While the Class 10 exams in Hindi, English, science and social science were going to be conducted only in north-east Delhi, Class 12 exams across the country were remaining in 12 subjects, including Hindi, geography, business studies, biotechnology, and sociology. An additional 11 subjects were pending for Class 12 students in NE Delhi schools.“I would not have been able to study for the two remaining papers that were to be held in July. We lost our house, my books, our shop, and everything in the riots. I just want to pass my exams ,” said Mohammad Fazil, a Class 10 student and a resident of north-east Delhi’s Brijpuri, who has been waiting for four months for his board exams to get over.“There has been enough anxiety over this. I just wanted it to get over,” he said. On May 18, the national school board announced that papers postponed due to the February riots and Covid-19 pandemic would be conducted between July 1 and 15. It said in April that the board will only conduct exams in “main subjects” that will be required for promotion and admission in higher education institutions.In addition, Class 12 students from north-east Delhi were also slated to appear for their mathematics, economics, history, biology, political science, chemistry, physics, accountancy and English examinations.Responding to a plea filed in the Supreme Court against conducting exams, the board said no further exams will be held for Class 10 students. Those in Class 12 will be given a chance to appear for exams whenever it was held, if they wanted. On Thursday, the board said the evaluation will be made on a special marking scheme based “on the last three exams.” Later in the evening, it announced that this will be based as a calculation of average score of the three subjects that a student has already taken and scored the maximum in. If a student has taken three of fewer tests, the average will be based on best-of-two.“Parents had been worried that their children were being asked to appear for their papers amid rising Covid-19 cases. The cancellation of exams is a relief for them. Students, however, are still concerned as they are trained to focus on board scores and are wary of how it would affect their prospects,” said Aparajita Gautam, president of Delhi Parents’ Association.Before it was clear that internal assessments will not be used to determine the theory paper score, a group of Class 12 students started a petition on change.org, an online petitioning forum, opposing such a plan. Their contention was based on the fact that school-level internal assessment is unlikely to be a standardised process across institutions.Naman Maheshwari, an aspiring engineer and Class 12 student of Mayo International School in IP Extension, said, “Many students don’t perform well in school exams and are likely to score around 10-15 marks more in their boards. These students will be at a disadvantage.”Arsh Malik, a class 12 student of Victoria Public School in Yamuna Vihar, said Thursday’s order had left many confused. “We have been calling teachers to understand what is happening with our exams. Personally, I would want to opt for the internal assessment mode because it has just been too long now. No one knows when the Covid-19 situation will get better.”Hazel Bali, class 12 student in Vasant Kunj, said most students are anxious as there is little clarity on the marking system. “This is distressing because everybody focusses on their performance during board exams and often don’t pay much attention to school papers,” she said, adding that she has a scholarship to study in the US.Most school principals are waiting for a clear direction from the board. Ameeta Wattal, principal of Springdales Road, Pusa Road, said, “This decision is balanced given the present circumstances. The open-ended solution caters to both groups – those who want to appear for their exams and improve their scores and others who don’t want to appear for their papers. We are waiting for the board to come up with the modalities.”Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School in Sadiq Nagar, said: “We will take all safety measures for the students who want to appear for their papers whenever it is conducted next. We must keep in mind that we can’t keep waiting endlessly for the exams to take place.”On June 17, Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia had also written to the HRD minister, requesting him to cancel pending class 10 and 12 papers. “I am happy that today’s decision was taken in the best interest of students and providing relief to parents,” Sisodia tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/students-schools-happy-but-confused-after-cbse-cancels-exams/story-OYYBU6Vn2INQ9ktblenVoL.html
26-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram teachers raise apprehensions about reporting to work||Around 90% of the staff at Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7 remained absent on Thursday after a Maths teacher tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Tuesday evening. Panic-stricken teachers chose to stay away from the school on Thursday despite the whole campus being sanitised on Wednesday. A diabetic patient, the affected teacher had been reporting to the school for work until last Friday and did not display any symptoms of the disease. “The affected individual did not display any symptoms. If he had displayed symptoms, people would have been extra cautious. With the whole staff reporting to work, interaction with each other is unavoidable and teachers now fear that they might have been infected. It is a scary situation. Teachers have been asked to report to work as per the routine but there is a lack of confidence especially since many tasks can be carried out from home,” said the teacher, who has also applied for a casual leave.Suman Sharma, school principal, said staff members who were in close contact with the affected teacher had been asked to give a written notice with details about the interaction and work from home till Saturday. “I have been receiving calls from many teachers asking for leave since a teacher from our school tested positive. Around 90% of the staff remained absent on Thursday, with most opting for casual leave,” said Sharma, adding said that this was a matter of concern since the department’s rules did not allow more than 20% of staff availing casual leave at the same time. This is the second Covid-19 case that has been reported from a government school in the district. Last week, a history teacher at the Government Senior Secondary School in Bhondsi had also tested positive. With coronavirus cases reaching schools, fear and anxiety are growing among members of the teaching community, who have been reporting to work regularly since the first week of June. Most teachers said that expecting teachers to report to work didn’t make much sense since children were not coming to school and online classes were already being conducted from home without any hindrances.Earlier in May, school principals and other officials who were needed for completion of administrative work had been asked to report to school. A fresh order issued by the department of education on June 6, however, directed the principals to ensure that all teachers are back at work and have regular attendance. Since then, schools have been operating at a 100% workforce.Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said, “Since June 6, we have been calling the entire staff to work. While we are abiding by physical distancing norms, with a workforce of about 100 people, some sort of bare minimum interaction does take place while marking the attendance. Many teachers have requested that they be allowed to work from home. But work has to continue in schools as we are bound by the directives,” said Sharma.Geeta Arya, principal, Government Boys’ Senior Secondary School, said that some teachers were travelling from other districts and even from neighbouring cities, such as Delhi, to report to work. “Many teachers come from places as far as Rewari and Delhi. While there is a risk of transmission, they are also facing an additional financial burden of transportation. Most of them are spending five times the normal costs due to the lack of public transport,” said Arya.Manjubala, a government school English teacher, said that there was no logic behind calling teachers to school on a daily basis, when most of the learning had shifted online. “We stay in school from 6 in the morning till 12:30 pm. After school hours, we are constantly in touch with students for classes since they access mobile phones at different times. Most of the work that we do at school can be done remotely,” said Manjubala.Another government school principal, who did not wish to be named, said that teachers with cold, cough, and flu — which might be indicators of Covid — were also reporting to work. “It is difficult to make out if people are suffering from Covid-19 or seasonal flu. Since it takes time to get tested, some of them continue to visit the school fearing action,” said the principal. She added that indirect pressure was being exerted on teachers to appear for work. “Information about education officers inspecting schools through surprise visits is shared on official WhatsApp group by seniors. They keep telling us about inquiry being initiated against missing teachers in other districts. Along with anxiety around staying safe, there is performance pressure too,” said the principal.Last week, the Haryana Lecturers Association had also raised objections to 100% staff being called to schools. Ashok Thakran, district head, Haryana School Lecturers Association, said that calling all teaches to school was not needed when their duties could be fulfilled remotely. “Children are not coming to school. In their absence, teachers will be largely idle at work and are bound to interact with each other. People are also travelling from Delhi and other areas which increases the risk of transmission,” said Thakran.Indu Boken, district education officer, said that the department was complying with directions that had been issued by the government. “We cannot take decisions regarding the attendance of teachers at the district level. These decisions are taken at the directorate level and need to be complied with,” said Boken, adding that apart from conducting online classes, teachers were also required in school for various other works such as dispersal of mid-day meals, book distribution, and maintenance of accounts.Boken said that the district administration had already given some relaxations to schools and teachers. “In schools that are in containment zones, teachers can be called as per a roster or as per need. Teachers who live in containment zones or are suffering from chronic illnesses such as diabetes and others can also work from home,” said Boken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-teachers-raise-apprehensions-about-reporting-to-work/story-0r2yvTMHHN10xtfstSCuLJ.html
26-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: MLA to discuss feasibility of lockdown-like measures with admin to curb Covid||A meeting to discuss lockdown-like measures in parts of the city to slow down the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease in hotspot areas is scheduled to be held Friday morning, to be attended by senior district administration officials and Gurugram MLA Sudhir Singla, who had last week proposed the imposition of a 10-day lock down in the city. Singla on Thursday said he will be talking to the Gurugram deputy commissioner and other officials of the district administration to discuss these measures.“I had called for a 10-day lockdown as it is important to break the chain of transmission but this should be done in consultation with all stakeholders. There is a need to introduce strict measures in containment zones and clusters where the infection spread is high. Markets can be opened in a staggered manner; the goal is to prevent crowds. I will take up these issues in the meeting,” said Singla, adding that he was hopeful they will be able to check the spread of Covid by strict enforcement. The matter was also taken up in a meeting chaired by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar during his visit last week.On Thursday, a meeting was held at the office of the Gurugram police commissioner to discuss measures needed to slow down the transmission of this virus in different parts of the city. Senior officials including Ashok Sangwan, divisional commissioner, Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, and others were also present.Referring to the meeting, Gurugram police commissioner Mohammed Akil said they discussed measures to control the rising number of coronavirus cases and how these can be stopped from spreading. “It is in a conceptual stage and the outcome will be shared once all agencies give their view points,” he added.Gurugram deputy commissioner Amit Khatri did not respond to phone calls and messages for a comment.The areas in the city particularly under the scanner are municipal wards which have both high infection rate and high population density. These include ward 22 (68 cases), ward 16 (89), ward 17 (83), ward 20 (80), ward 18 (65), ward 33 (75), ward 23 (87), ward 15 (50), ward 26 (101) ward 28 (64), ward 35 (91), ward 34 (164), ward 32 (189) and ward 29 (109).Health department officials, meanwhile, said there was a possibility of collating containment zones into larger extended zones for better management and enforcement of rules related to social distancing and movement. The area of the containment zones, which was brought down from three km to one km, could again be expanded but a final decision is yet to be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-mla-to-discuss-feasibility-of-lockdown-like-measures-with-admin-to-curb-covid/story-qDfax2MQqpXXIMnN7yriJK.html
26-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Real estate stutters due to pandemic, 81% fall in housing sales, says report||The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic has had a debilitating impact on the real estate sector. It is estimated that housing sales plummeted by 81% in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 in the top seven markets of the country, according to a report by private real estate consultancy Anarock. Not surprisingly, the National Capital Region (NCR), the real estate hub of north India, also did not witness any new realty project being launched during this period, the report adds. The seven cities from where this data was collected include the MMR, NCR, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Pune and Kolkata.The report says residential property sales across the top seven cities of the country plunged to 12,720 units in the second quarter of this year, as compared to 68,000 units in the same period of 2019.Echoing a similar view, Gurugram-based developers and consultants said sales were virtually non-existent and that they were finding it difficult to manage even client visits. “There is a lot of uncertainty due to the coronavirus pandemic related to jobs and businesses. The latest tension with China has further added to the woes,” said Sanjay Sharma, a city-based consultant.The report stated that significant reduction in housing sales were witnessed in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and NCR as business fell by 83% in both areas in the second quarter of this year, compared to last year. The sale of houses in MMR was recorded at 2,100 units while NCR saw only 3,620 housing units being sold since the pandemic reared its head in the country, the report said.“A massive drop in both new launches and housing sales were, of course, expected on the back of a complete lockdown for most of this quarter,” said Anuj Puri, chairman of Anarock.He however said that some cities, despite being affected by Covid-19, showed a high number of sales, which was due to technology adoption which had helped in housing sales of late, as many developers are now strengthening their digital sales capabilities.The report also said that due to the impact of the pandemic, only 1,390 units were launched in the top seven markets in the country compared to 69,000 units launched in the similar period in 2019. In this quarter, only four projects – two in Bengaluru and one each in Pune and Kolkata – were launched while no new projects were launched in MMR, NCR, Hyderabad or Chennai, the report adds.Praveen Jain, vice-chairman of National Real Estate Development Council (Naredco), Haryana said the realty sector in Gurugram as well as across NCR is in rough waters as sales are negligible while projects are getting delayed due to lack of workforce, as migrant workers had returned to their home districts and villages due to the lack of means of livelihood during the national lockdown, imposed to curb the spread of the pandemic. “The demand for new houses is quite subdued and no new inquiries are coming our way. My own company has been able to sell very few units and whatever sale propositions are being discussed are old leads. A booster shot is needed to revive the real estate sector,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-real-estate-stutters-due-to-pandemic-81-fall-in-housing-sales-says-report/story-yrp0qVXRRiQx0U49zE0QHL.html
26-06-2020||Delhi||Overcrowded shelter homes in Delhi face new coronavirus challenge||The raging Covid-19 pandemic in the capital has brought a fresh set of concerns for the state government — the safety of rescued children at government-run shelter homes.Alarm bells have started ringing in the state administration ever since 57 minors in a shelter home in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh tested positive for the virus on June 21.Back home, as the number of daily cases being reported from the city grows exponentially, the government is yet to formulate a protocol to test and safely house the newly rescued children who are placed in protection centres.Delhi has 27 shelter homes for children and women. Apart from their own facilities, the government has also roped in NGOs that run around 61 such centres.The caretakers of these packed facilities said that since the outbreak ,many shelter homes are struggling to ensure social distancing among its residents. However, the bigger problem now are the new entrants, where the background and exposure of children are not clear and to put them in direct contact with other minors in the protection homes could lead to more infections.Also read | Social distancing goes for a toss at Delhi’s RML testing centre“We are already running at full capacity and this pandemic has caused quite a few management problems. We have tried to place beds at a distance to ensure social distancing and to ensure that interaction between residents and even staff members happens from a distance, so that there is a limited chance of any infection spreading. However, if even one case comes up here, then controlling it would be a problem,” said the caretaker of one such government-run facility in west Delhi.He added, “These children who are rescued, often live in dingy places during their time away from their families and often come in contact with a lot of people, putting them at a greater risk of contracting the infection. Many could also be asymptomatic carriers, but there is no space to put them in quarantine.”A senior official at Nirmal Chhaya, a Delhi government shelter for children and women, said that on April 18, the administration had converted its short-stay home located on west Delhi’s Jail Road into an ‘isolation centre’ for rescued children and women. However, new entrants are not tested for coronavirus and isolation rules are barely being followed.“Testing all the rescued children who come here is not possible especially considering the low testing in the city. However, before being admitted children are put through a standard medical examination, which was followed even before the pandemic hit, and their temperature is recorded,” said the official.Social organisations working for the rescue of trafficked children said these centres are already in “poor condition”, bursting at their seems and functioning beyond its capacity. The pandemic has just made things worse.Also read | Covid-19 crisis: Sero survey to cover 20,000 people across Delhi’s 11 districtsRishi Kant from Shakti Vahini, an NGO fighting against human trafficking — which also partners with police and government agencies to rescue trafficked women and children — said, “The situation in these shelter homes was already bad. This virus has only strained the infrastructure more. There is a protocol that we must try that rescued children do not have to come to protection homes in the first place and are instead sent to their respective states and families immediately. But that is not happening.”Delhi minister for women and child development Rajendra Pal Gautam said that surprise inspections are being conducted in the shelter and observational homes to ensure that what happened in Kanpur (where 57 minors tested positive) does not repeat in the Capital.“We did a surprise inspection on Tuesday and found that the facilities were adequate. However, I have directed all officials to pay special attention to the health and safety of children and women. This is our priority,” Gautam said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/overcrowded-shelter-homes-face-new-virus-challenge/story-yuUY39RGZhsuUX17mjdBBK.html
26-06-2020||Delhi||Changes in CBSE evaluation process may affect DU admissions||Delhi University (DU) may have to make changes in its admission criteria in case the Central Board of Education’s (CBSE) alternative evaluation plan is not similar with that of other education and state boards like earlier years, officials said on Thursday.The CBSE on Thursday informed the Supreme Court that it will not conduct the remaining class 10 and 12 exams, scheduled between July 1 and July 15, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The board, however, said those in class 12 can either take exams later or move ahead with the internal assessment based on their performance in the last three internal exams. The board, however, is yet to come up with a detailed evaluation plan for class 12 students.Shobha Bagai, Dean of Admissions (DU), said the university will hold a meeting to discuss the impact of any change in CBSE’s evaluation policy on the merit-based undergraduate admissions in DU colleges. “We will have to check how the CBSE is announcing the results this year. The changed criteria won’t affect the entrance-based admissions. But in case of merit-based admissions, we will have to see if CBSE’s plan of evaluation is in parity with other state educational boards. Many state boards have already announced their results. So, if the CBSE is not making major changes, we will go ahead with our existing admission process. However, if there are some major changes in the evaluation process and it becomes difficult to assess it on the same level of other educational boards, then we will have to think and make some adjustments in the admission process as well,” she said.In DU, the maximum number of applicants seeking admissions in undergraduate courses are from CBSE-affiliated schools. Last year, out of total 2,58,388 applications in UG courses, 2,05,434 were CBSE students.Pankaj Garg, a faculty at DU’s Rajdhani College and a former member of DU’s admission committee, said there could be a major issue in calculating best of four subjects due to changes in CBSE’s evaluation process. “The exams of some subjects such as Sociology, Geography and Hindi in which DU offers honours courses are still pending. For those from the northeast Delhi, other exams are pending. It’s mandatory to include these subjects while calculating the aggregate of the best four subjects for admission. In case, some students could not perform well in these subjects in the internal exams, they might lose the opportunity to get a seat in a DU college,” he said.Several principals raised concerns over the delay in the admission process. Rama Sharma, principal of Hansraj College, said, “Admissions are already delayed this year due to Covid-19. The university will be able to release cutoffs after the CBSE declares the results of class 12 exams. In case a large number of students opt for exams later as an option given by the board, the admission process can be delayed further. The university cannot wait for that long to start the admissions.”DU had started the registration process for both undergraduate and postgraduate courses on June 20. It did not declare the dates for the cutoff lists in view of the pending CBSE board exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/changes-in-cbse-evaluation-process-may-affect-du-admissions/story-2UM5GbeyRSewVJDZ3VDlmN.html
26-06-2020||Noida||Noida upgraded to three stars for waste management after review||The ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) on Thursday upgraded Noida’s rank for its solid waste management system to three stars from the one-star rating it had awarded last month.This was the first time that Noida participated in the rating exercise that looked into 25 key parameters on waste management. At present, it is the highest rated among the six cities in Uttar Pradesh that participated in the survey that was conducted in October last year. “My heartiest congratulations to Visakhapatnam, Vadodara, Ahmedanagar, Pune, Ballarpur, Noida, Gwalior,which have been upgraded in review as 3-Star #GarbageFreeCities. Their representation on recent certification has been scrutinised by 3rd Party & been found fit for higher rating,” tweeted Durga Shanker Mishra, secretary, MoHUA.The Star Rating Of Garbage Free Cities survey requires participating cities to submit a self-assessment and self-verification document on its waste management system. It is then further verified through an independent third-party agency appointed by MoHUA.On the list of 141 cities that were awarded stars, there are 73 cities that now share the three-star rank. Five cities -- Ambikapur, Rajkot, Surat, Mysore, Indore and Navi Mumbai -- top the chart with five stars. The rating system helps cities assess their progress while encouraging them to move towards a better rating, thereby improving their overall cleanliness and aesthetics.“In the survey, they had given us zero for remediation. But we had a plant at sector 145 for this purpose. We approached the ministry with this and that got us the three stars,” said Ritu Maheshwari, Noida authority CEO.The Noida authority said they will aim to win five-star rating next year and the seven-star rating in 2022. “We had applied for the five-star category and worked very hard. But we are happy to get the three-star rank because it is the first time that Noida participated and won a prestigious award. Now we aim to improve in certain areas such as ensuring the garbage is not strewn on roadsides in the city and other parameters,” said SC Mishra senior project engineer of the Noida authority head of the health department.The health department said that it had planned to convert 350 undesignated garbage points into “beauty spots”.“But we could not finish this task before the survey that started in October, 2019. We could build only 140 beauty spots. We have fixed our target to improve on multiple areas to get five-star rating next year,” said Mishra.Other weak spots for the city were its failure to clean its 300 drains, not segregating waste at households, inadequate composting facilities, material recovery centre built only in two out of 10 and waste treatment facilities.Noida spread across 20000 hectares of an area generates around 650 tonne of waste daily. Gautam Budh Nagar district development residents’ welfare association (DDRWA), a residents’ body said that the authority could not develop a much-needed infrastructure on time.“The Noida authority started the preparations to make city garbage free late and could not finish its targets on time. Also, it has not taken residents’ on board from all sectors. The authority must focus on sustainable models so that the waste treatment facilities work for long term,” said NP Singh president of DDRWA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-upgraded-to-three-stars-for-waste-management-after-review/story-a0tu2ZXmvmJH6USzMtsxRL.html
26-06-2020||Noida||Delhi health official assaulted by cops: SDMC files complaint with Noida police||Officials of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) have filed a complaint with the Noida commissioner of police and the district magistrate regarding the assault of a Delhi health department official at the Delhi-Noida-Direct flyway (DND) border allegedly by two Noida policemen.The alleged incident took place on June 19 around 6.30pm at DND when Dr Saurabh Mishra, a deputy health officer (DHO) with the West zone of SDMC was on his way home to Sector 137 in Noida. Despite having the requisite permission, his driver was allegedly stopped by a police head constable at the DND border, while Mishra was asleep in the back seat of his vehicle, his family had said. His family had alleged that the constable had misbehaved with him, while a police sub-inspector (SI) had manhandled him. Following the incident, the DHO filed a complaint with Noida police against the two cops.“It has been so many days and no action has been taken against the responsible parties,” said Namrata Narayan, Mishra’s wife on Thursday.Deputy commissioner of SDMC, Shirish Sharma, on Wednesday filed a complaint with the Noida police commissioner. “We have also written to the Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate to look into the matter and take appropriate action,” said Sharma.In the letter, the deputy commissioner said according to the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) guidelines all restrictions on inter-state movement were lifted starting May 30. However, despite the guidelines, the DHO —who was returning home in Noida after performing his day’s work—was stopped at the border, asked to produce his ID card and duty pass, which is a clear violation of the MHA order, the letter alleged. The SDMC deputy commissioner demanded that due action should be taken to avoid the recurrence of such an incident. However, according to the Uttar Pradesh government rules, vehicles from Delhi can only enter Noida—which had sealed its border with the national capital in April— with a valid identity card and the pass issued by the Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate. When contacted, district magistrate Suhas LY said the city police were looking into the matter.The Noida police said a departmental inquiry in the case is already underway. “A probe in the matter is on and we will have a resolution soon,” said deputy commissioner of police (DCP), zone 1, Sankalp Sharma.Police officers also said they have spoken to Mishra’s family as well. “The sub-inspector has conveyed his apology to the family. We will try to resolve this unfortunate incident amicably. The SI in question had been posted at the border since day one of the border sealing and lost his cool when he heard the doctor and head constable arguing. The case will be resolved soon,” said additional DCP, zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh.According to a police officer, who did not wish to be named, said the head constable asked the DHO’s driver for a pass who was not carrying it himself, but the DHO, who was sleeping on the backseat of the car, had the pass on him. The constable asked the driver to take a U-turn to Delhi as he was not carrying the pass. When the health officer was woken up, he produced the pass and allegedly pushed the constable two to three times. A scuffle ensued between the two following which the SI lost his cool and allegedly slapped the DHO, said the police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/delhi-health-official-assaulted-by-cops-sdmc-files-complaint-with-noida-police/story-jI1F2Oq6FVIyXgNEsrqqtJ.html

The teachers also alleged that the new contractor was threatening to fire them if they did not pay the amount and would engage new appointees. The teachers, in their complaint, also mentioned the 2014 judgment of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), which had said that the department would have to continue with the services of these teachers till the administration selected computer teachers on a regular basis.Senior teachers draw a salary of around Rs 35,000 per month while junior teachers get around Rs 29,000 per month.Mehta said, “We have asked the firm to explain its position. Terms and conditions of the contract do not mention that they can ask for such a payment. If it’s true, the contract with the firm will be cancelled and terminated.”Akhil Sharma, proprietor of RR Enterprises, said, “Our legal team is looking into the matter of the CAT and will respond in the coming days and weeks. We will also respond to the DEO’s notice regarding the complaints of charging money by next week..”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/computer-teachers-accuse-firm-of-demanding-money-chandigarh-education-dept-seeks-explanation/story-QYe7SaoFMZhAQH0WV1713N.html
26-06-2020||Delhi||Railways fits emergency alarm systems in 50 Covid coaches||The Northern Railways has installed emergency alarm systems all its 50 railway coaches that have been turned into isolation wards at the Shakur Basti station washing shed.On Wednesday, the isolation coaches received two Covid-19 positive patients.The health of one of the two Covid-19 positive patients shifted to isolation coaches stationed at Shakur Basti railway station washing shed deteriorated on Thursday after which he was moved to a nearby hospital, senior northern railways officials said. Bhagwan Mahavir Hospital in Pitampura is the primary hospital attached to the isolation coaches, as per the agreement between the state government and the railways ministry. However, it was not clear whether the patient was admitted there or to some other hospital. Also read | Covid-19 crisis: Sero survey to cover 20,000 people across Delhi’s 11 districtsA senior district administration official, who asked not to be named, said that he was not aware that where the patient was shifted or what illness he had . The official said that there is a team of army doctors and health department doctors and they take the call in such situations. On being asked if the patient had pressed the emergency alarm bell installed in the coach to report about his health complications, a senior railway official, who wished not to be named said, “The patient was already under observation. This emergency alarm facility will come into use once all the coaches are filled with patients .”On Thursday, four more Covid-19 positive patients were shifted to the isolation facility, taking the total number of patients in such isolation wards to six.  The emergency alarm system comprises an alarm bell, a display board — having a buzzer and a light against each coach number — and a big emergency red light with siren fitted outside each coach. The objective behind installing the alarm system is to provide immediate medical or any other attention to Covid-19 positive patients in case of an emergency, Northern Railways officials said.Also read | At Delhi’s shelter homes, inmates complain of no medicine while doctors battle multiple threatsGiving details about how the alarm system functions, Deepak Kumar, chief public relations officer (CPRO) of Northern Railway, said that the alarm bell has been installed in each coach occupied by patients. The display board, on the other hand, has been installed in the coach housing doctors and specialised medical staff.“In case of an emergency, as soon as the patient presses the emergency call bell, a red light fitted outside the coach starts glowing along with a loud sound. This will also be simultaneously displayed on the display board installed inside the doctor’s coach, where the bulb against the coach number will light-up with an alarm sound. This will enable the caregivers to immediately rush to the particular coach to attend to the patient,” said Kumar.Another railway official, who did not want to be named, said that an alarm bell will also be installed in the coach where nursing attendant deployed by the Delhi health department will stay put.“The bell can be pressed either by the patient or the attendant. The siren system installed outside the coach is so strong that it will alert medical staff even if they are in the last coach. The red light will help them identify the coach from where the alarm was sounded,” said the official.In all, 503 railway coaches have been turned into makeshift Covid-19 isolation wards and are stationed at nine different stations – Anand Vihar, Shakur Basti, Sarai Rohilla, Shahdara, Safdarjung, Adarsh Nagar, Delhi Cantt, Tughlakabad and Patel Nagar – in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/railways-fits-emergency-alarm-systems-in-50-covid-coaches/story-ENTIwIpLynpBtDl5ZiFKgM.html
26-06-2020||Mumbai||Rising Covid-19 fatalities another worry for Maharashtra||The case fatality rate (CFR), which has been on the rise since the end of May, has emerged as another cause for concern for Maharashtra, along with the rise in cases. By the end of May, the state had successfully brought down the case fatality rate to 3.26% (on May 26) from 7.41% (with 148 deaths) on April 13.On Thursday, the case fatality rate was 4.69%, second highest in the country, after Gujarat where the CFR was 5.99% with 1,735 deaths (28,943 reported cases) till Wednesday. But Maharashtra has highest number of deaths across states in the country. The state recorded 192 deaths taking toll to 6,931. Of them, 109 deaths were from the past 48 hours, while the rest were from past few days, health officials said. The toll has reached close to the 7,000 mark in only four days, after crossing the 6,000 mark on June 21. In the past five days, the state has recorded as many as 947 deaths. On June 23 and 24, the daily toll was over 200. It also means 46.53% of total deaths in the country are registered in Maharashtra alone. On Thursday, the country’s death toll went up to 14,894.Officials admit that the rise in CFR is a concern, but insist a lot of deaths are from the past, as they are adding missing fatalities and the situation will be under control soon. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, public health expert, who is also heading state’s communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee, said, “Rising CFR is always a concern, but our case is a bit different as we are also adding missing number of deaths to the tally. This has impacted overall CFR of the state, but it is a temporary phenomenon.”State health minister Rajesh Tope said they have adopted a patient-centric policy and there is no need to fear. “We have also taken many important measures to reduce CFR such as constitution of a task force, preparing a treatment protocol and providing best available drugs. Today, we have also decided to start conducting rapid antigen tests and ELISA-based antibodies tests which help in gauging prevalence of the epidemic in a containment zone. Antigen tests will also be conducted on frontline workers such as doctors, nurses, ward boys, police etc.,” Tope said.Last week, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a review meeting directed to constitute a task force comprising experts and senior doctors at district or division level to bring down CFR.The highest-single day toll was recorded with 248 deaths on June 23. Of them, 75 were from last 48 hours while the rest were from the past, clarified the health department.Meanwhile, Maharashtra recorded 4,841 cases, the highest single-day spike on Thursday. This is the first time the tally of fresh cases crossed the 4,000 mark. With this, Covid-19 count in state has reached 1,47,741. Of them, 63,342 are active cases, according to the data released by state health department.With the state officials expecting a peak in July, the number of fresh cases is also likely to rise and situation may become more difficult in the coming days. On Wednesday, the state had reported the highest single-day spike then of 3,890 cases. It was also the 15th day when the state reported over 3000 cases in a day.Last week, state health minister Rajesh Tope said the peak has started. He said over 77,000 patients have recovered and discharged from various hospitals across Maharashtra. Of the 63,342 patients, 80% are asymptomatic, 10-15% have symptoms and only 4-5% patients have severe conditions.“The doubling rate has improved to 30 days, which is a parameter to determine the situation. In countries such as the US, UK, Spain France etc. cases per million are between 4,000 and 6000, whereas in Maharashtra, it is 1200 per million. While deaths per million in foreign countries are between 400 and 600, the number is 60 in the state,” the health minister said.The health minister also informed the state cabinet has decided to request the central government to postpone exams (due in August) of post-graduate medical students or promote them based on internal assessment as if they went for studies then the state will face a shortage of doctors in hospitals. They have also requested the health ministry to consider MBBS doctors’ service in hospitals as internship and also postpone NEET exams for medical students. A resolution was passed in the state cabinet meeting on Thursday.In the past two days, 7822 patients have recovered which has improved the recovery rate. On Thursday, 3661 patients recovered, while on Wednesday, the number was 4161. With this, the recovery rate has reached 52.42% On June 22, it slipped to 49.86% from 50.99% on June 16.

26-06-2020||City||Barring Covid, no problem in holding elections in J&K, says L-G Murmu||Handpicked by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the first lieutenant governor of the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, Girish Chandra Murmu, 60, took charge on October 31 last year to foster peace, stability and development in the region three months after its special status was revoked. He spoke to HT principal correspondent Ravi Krishnan Khajuria on a host of issues, including opening up the political space for parties, setting up the delimitation commission and holding elections. Edited excerpts:It’s going to be a year of the revocation of Article 370 on August 5. When will political activity be revived in J&K? When will remaining political prisoners, particularly People’s Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti, be released?President’s rule is a temporary provision. The Election Commission has announced members to the delimitation commission. Political parties are conducting outreach programmes. So, the political process is there. We wanted to have local body elections in February and March but by then Covid-19 played spoilsport. There is a mechanism to review political detentions. It is done by a security review committee headed by the home secretary. Most detainees have been released. Beyond a certain period, you can’t detain politicians. The EC is the competent authority to take a call on delimitation. The situation here (in J&K) is good. Except Covid, I don’t see any problem in holding elections.Where do politicians such as former chief ministers Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti figure in the new political landscape?India is a secular, socialist, democratic republic where people choose their leaders. So, everyone has a role to play. Any old or new party has an equal right to elect and get elected. There is nothing like a new political landscape. Revoking the temporary provision (Article 370) was a historic decision, a watershed moment. It has opened up more opportunities for people to participate and be master of their destiny. As for Mehbooba Mufti’s release, there is a process of which I’m not a part so I can’t comment. Besides the security review committee, there are court directions.How do you see Apni Party, led by Syed Altaf Bukhari, in the new landscape? There was also talk about an advisory council.There can be a new or an old party or a combination. They have their own opportunities and challenges but they have been leaders. People will decide. I’m not aware of an advisory council. Under President’s rule, the power rests with the governor or lieutenant governor who takes advice from professionals. In J&K, we have four advisers. I don’t think that kind of arrangement (advisory council) exists anywhere in the country. Maybe it was a rumour.The killing of Congress sarpanch Ajay Pandita and abduction of a woman sarpanch have reignited fears among Kashmiri Pandits in the Valley. How do you see the security scenario in Kashmir?Kashmir has always been plagued by certain issues since Independence. There are forces from outside and within aiding and abetting such activities but our security forces are taking on the challenges and have succeeded to a great extent. We are trying developmental programmes for participatory management and growth. I see it (the violence) as a phenomenon that was there earlier too and occasionally returns in the form of desperate attempts (to disrupt peace).Are you mulling security cover to over 25,000 sarpanches and panches? They are the only elected representatives in J&K today and the most vulnerable.I have a different approach to this. We want to secure the entire UT and its people. Of course, there is a provision to provide security to vulnerable representatives, depending upon the threat perception, but my intention is to give a general sense of well-being to all. We have an area domination mechanism in place but yes in rare cases of increased threat, security cover can be thought of.Pakistan has also gone all out, using psychological warfare and IT platforms to radicalise Kashmiri youth. What is being done to wean them away and bring them to the national mainstream?It’s been going on for the past many years in a bid to destabilise us but our security forces have been able to contain terrorism. The key is in all round development to bring them to the mainstream. Let there be development and employment so that everyone, particularly youngsters, gets an opportunity to progress. Recently, 10,000 jobs were announced and 30,000 to 40,000 more will be announced in six months in phases. We have introduced new recruitment rules and are focusing on the IT sector.Pakistan has been targeting our posts and villages on the LoC and border.Our security forces are prepared to deal with any contingency. We have faced such hostilities earlier also. It only shows Pakistan’s frustration.What are the plans to tide over rising unemployment?Unemployment is a global phenomenon and post-Covid most nations have suffered. J&K could not build infrastructure earlier and create job opportunities so investment could not come. We are focusing on education to enhance employability and entrepreneurship. If things get normal, the global investors’ summit will be held in October. MNCs have shown interest and we convinced film producers to set up studios here.Will Amarnath Yatra be held this year? What about the Vaishno Devi pilgrimage?We are prepared but we will have to protect people also. Let’s see how things evolve due to the pandemic but the traditional pooja will take place at the Amarnath shrine. We will take a decision at the right time on resuming the Vaishno Devi pilgrimage.Are you satisfied with J&K’s Covid mitigation efforts?Absolutely. We were the first to ensure 100% testing of returnees. Our recovery rate is tremendous and our doubling rate is 22 days. We have 25,000 per million tests and six labs are conducting Covid tests. The death increased a bit recently but still we are doing a good job. Our mortality rate is just 1.4% and the recovery rate is impressive. Our health staff, religious leaders and people have worked 24x7 and cooperated tremendously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/barring-covid-no-problem-in-holding-elections-in-j-k-says-l-g-murmu/story-w9iJmj9VAy3gKKkdKho0PO.html

IIT-D director V Ramgopal Rao on Thursday said the institute will follow the recommendations made by a sub-committee on the minimum common strategy to be followed by all IITs. “We do not have a choice this year. We will follow the sub committee’s report, which recommends online mode to conduct classes for the upcoming semester,” he said. According to the sub-committee’s report — which HT has reviewed — submitted to the IIT council’s standing committee on June 15, classes for the first semester of the 2020-21 academic year will be conducted online for all courses. “Semester 1 (2020-21) classes for all UG [undergraduate] and PG [postgraduate] programs to be conducted in online mode for all courses, with short term and smaller weightage evaluations through viva, online quizzes, take-home exams, online exams, etc,” reads the report. Rao said IIT-D will allow students facing difficulties in attending online classes due to problems with internet access to return to the campus, as recommended by the sub-committee. “These students will also take online classes from their hostels. No individual shall be forced to return to campus, he/she shall take relevant safety, quarantine and safe travel measures, as applicable,” the report added. The institute will shift the laboratory component of the courses to a later part of the academic year, as recommended by the sub-committee.However, the situation will be reviewed again in October 2020, officials said. The institute will allow PhD students, who require experimental research facilities and others who need other institute resources, to return to the campus if they wish, after July 20. “We will allow the PhD students to return to the campus gradually after July 20. IIT-Delhi will mostly follow what the sub-committee report has recommended,” Rao said.The institute will also formulate standard operating procedures (SOP) for various research, administration, teaching and hostel activities to contain the spread of Covid-19. IIT-D has a combined staff and strength of over 20,000 students at its Hauz Khas campus. The institute had shifted all its classes online on March 13 in view of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-iit-b-iit-delhi-to-shift-all-classes-online-for-next-semester/story-qaoKBbuQwn3aJGBtizoDvJ.html

But joint efforts yielded encouraging results,” he saidIn 2012-13, cotton acreage was recorded at 4.81 lakh hectares in Punjab. Cotton is sown in eight districts of south Malwa with concentration in four districts only. This year, Bathinda leads with 1.72 lakh hectares under cotton cultivation, followed by Fazilka (1.22 lakh), Muktsar (1.01 lakh) and Mansa (93,775).Sangrur, Faridkot, Moga and Barnala districts together recorded sowing on over 12,000 hectares.Sources said the state crossed 5-lakh-hectare mark only once in 2011-12 when 5.16 lakh hectares were under cotton crop.In 2015, cotton belt suffered widespread damage to the crop after whitefly attack and in the next three years, the area under cotton shrunk drastically. In 2018-19, cotton was sown on 2.83 lakh hectares, lowest in the decade as the agronomy of the cotton belt was hit due to the pest attacks in 2015.However, 2019-20 saw a bumper season when cotton production touched the record 43 lakh quintals. Also, farmers got good returns as Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) purchased a sizeable chunk at MSP (minimum support price) and it motivated farmers to bring more area under cotton.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-has-cotton-on-5l-hectares-this-season-highest-in-a-decade/story-veRtL9UdZ79qybVoA1kbWK.html
26-06-2020||Pune||Garbage-free cities: Pune gets 3-star rating||Pune bagged three-star rating in a central government’s ranking for garbage-free cities (GFC), said officials on Thursday.The ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) upgraded the rating for Pune, Noida, Visakhapatnam, Vadodara, Ahmednagar, Ballarpur and Gwalior from one-star previously.The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) aims to make it to top ten cities in the Swachh Survey. Solid waste management department head Gyaneshwar Molak said, “It is encouraging to receive three-star certificate in garbage-free cities. Some cities were ranked fivestar, but PMC scored in other parameters.”“My heartiest congratulations to Visakhapatnam, Vadodara, Ahmednagar, Pune, Ballarpur, Noida, Gwalior, which have been upgraded in review as three-star Garbage Free Cities. Their representations on recent certification have been scrutinised by a third party and were found fit for a higher rating,” MoHUA secretary DS Mishra tweeted.In another tweet, Mishra also applauded the efforts of citizens, city managers and political executives in managing the construction and demolition wastes, remediation of landfills and other aspects of solid waste and ODF (open-defecation free) management. “This will ensure Sampurna Swachhata (total cleanliness), improved quality of life and ease in living,” he said. The star rating of garbage-free cities, a MoHUA initiative, envisions to enable cities to gradually evolve into a model, seven-star city, with progressive improvements in their overall cleanliness. The star rating is based on 25 key parameters of solid waste management and has been designed to help cities assess their progress, encouraging them to move towards a better rating and improving their overall cleanliness and aesthetics.The certificate is based on the whole year’s performance in 2019. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “All the employees and residents will make efforts this year to take Pune to top spot. We have received three-star rating in garbage-free cities. We hope to top in the Swacch survey. PMC had not qualified for open defecation free status, but later it improved its ranking.”The mandatory parameters for GFC ratings include door-to-door garbage collection and their segregation at source besides sweeping at public, commercial and residential areas. It also includes the provision of litter bins, storage bins and processing of wet and dry wastes, besides redressals of people’s grievances, said officials.The desirable parameters include sustainability, on-site wet waste processing, dumpsite remediation besides collection and disposal of all forms of waste, penalty and spot fines, availability and use of scientific landfill, water bodies and storm water drains, screening of nallahs and construction waste management, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/garbage-free-cities-pune-gets-3-star-rating/story-80VBACGtLb8wNx2b1pJgaJ.html

The MC floated tenders for the selection of a contractor for five times, but only a single contractor came forward for running the facility each time. Finally, the MC decided to appoint the only contractor, who has offered Rs 35 lakh to the MC per annum for a 10-year contract.The committee approved a resolution, issuing a work order to the contractor, during a meeting held at mayor Balkar Sandhu’s camp office here on Wednesday. MC also received consent of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) on Wednesday for operating the plant, which was pending for the past six months.The facility is capable of slaughtering 2,000 poultry birds per hour in two shifts of eight hours each; and 1,000 goats, sheep and pigs.The MC House has fixed Rs 150 for slaughtering a goat/sheep, Rs 10 for a poultry bird and Rs 100 for a pig.The officials said the facility also has an effluent treatment plant, a preservation and chilling facility, and a blood processing unit. Once commissioned, the facility will enable the MC to implement a complete ban on illegal slaughtering in the city. Meat traders will have to get the animals slaughtered at the facility and will be allowed to sell only this meat at their respective shops.The officials said illegal slaughtering results in unhygienic conditions and the waste, including blood, is also dumped in the sewers, which is illegal. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had taken a note of the same in the past and directed the MC to stop illegal slaughtering. The MC is also establishing five modern shops at various locations of the city from where the contractor will be able to sell meat. Three shops have also been constructed on the Gill, Metro and Hambran roads.MC senior veterinary officer Dr YP Singh said, “The F&CC has issued the work order and the facility is expected to become operational in a month. The amount payable by the contractor would be increased by 5% every year. No illegal slaughtering will be allowed in the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nod-to-appointment-of-contractor-modern-abattoir-in-ludhiana-may-start-operations-in-a-month/story-SyELT7BYguG74HtDu7W6WJ.html
26-06-2020||World||US imposes visa restrictions on Chinese officials over Hong Kong autonomy||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday the United States was imposing visa restrictions on Chinese Communist Party officials believed responsible for restricting freedoms in Hong Kong.“Today, I am announcing visa restrictions on current and former CCP officials who are believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy,’ Pompeo said in a statement, which did not name those targeted. The announcement comes in response to moves by China to impose new security legislation on Hong Kong, which prompted US President Donald Trump last month to initiate a process to eliminate special economic treatment that has allowed the territory to remain a global financial center.It also comes at a time of intensified US rhetoric against China in the midst of Trump’s re-election campaign, in which opinion polls have shown voters increasingly embittered toward Beijing, especially over the coronavirus, which began in that country.“President Trump promised to punish the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials who were responsible for eviscerating Hong Kong’s freedoms. Today, we are taking action to do just that,” Pompeo said in the statement.He said China’s Communist Party had stepped up efforts to undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy through the national security legislation and by putting pressure on local authorities to arrest pro-democracy activists and disqualify pro-democracy electoral candidates.Pompeo called on China to honor its commitment to allow Hong Kong “a high degree of autonomy” and added: “The United States will continue to review its authorities to respond to these concerns.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-imposes-visa-restrictions-on-chinese-officials-over-hong-kong-autonomy/story-Uia1VexglIKCflA3QiLOhN.html
26-06-2020||World||US records nearly 40k virus cases in a day; total cases 10 times more than reported, say experts||A top public health official has said that the actual number of cumulative Covid-19 infections in the United States is around 10 times the reported number, which stood at 2.42 million Friday as the surge in new cases continued unabated with infections going up by nearly 40,000 in another one-day record.Daily fatalities that had fallen into three-digit numbers have rebounded into the thousands at 2,423, taking the toll to 124,415. The spike in new infections was being reported mostly from souther and western states of Florida, Texas, Arizona and California — some of whom paused their reopening, such as Texas — and were fueled by younger people in their 20s, 30s and 40s who are socialising more as stay-at-home restrictions, are lifted, and without taking the usual precautions.“Our best estimate right now is that for every case that’s reported, there actually are 10 other infections,” Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told reporters Thursday, taking up the estimate of infections to at least 24 million.Blood samples collected for testing antibodies showed that for every confirmed infection there were 10 people with antibodies but no symptoms.“The traditional approach of looking for symptomatic illness, and diagnoses obviously underestimated the total number of infections,” Redfield said. “Now that serology tests are available, which test for antibodies, the estimates we have right now show about 10 times more people have antibodies in the jurisdictions tested than had documented infections.”New infections went up by 39,972 in the United States in the past 24 hours, marking a new daily high, spotlighting that epidemic is far from over, as the Trump administration had been keen to convey in the president’s hurry to put behind a crisis that could cast a shadow on his re-election.Vice President Mike Pence, who leads the White House coronavirus task force, said Friday Covid-19 cases were rising “precipitously” in 16 states, mostly in southern United States , as the number of new infections went up to 40,000 in the last 24 hours, marking a new one-day high.Fatalities were up to 126,000, he added. The spike in new infections was being reported mostly from souther and western states of Florida, Texas, Arizona and California — some of whom paused their reopening, such as Texas — and were fueled by younger people in their 20s, 30s and 40s who are socializing more as stay-at-home restrictions, are lifted, and without taking the usual precautions.“Roughly half of the new cases are Americans under the age of 25,” said Pence, naming Florida and Texas, specifically, leading a briefing by task force after almost two months, in recognition of the gravity of the crisis brought on by the new surge.New infections went up by more than 40,000 in the United States in the past 24 hours, marking a new daily high and serving a grim reminder that the epidemic was far from over, as the Trump administration had been keen to convey in the president’s hurry to put behind a crisis that could cast a shadow on his re-election.Some states halted their reopening plans as a result of increasing cases. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has put it on hold entirely, and brought back some restrictions. “The last thing we want to do as a state is go backwards and close down businesses,” he said in a statement on Thursday. But in light of the growing gravity of the crisis in the state, that’s exactly what he did Friday morning, by reviving restrictions on bars and restaurants and certain outdoor activities.Florida also brought back some restriction, prohibiting sale of alcohol at bars.Things are far worse than the existing numbers conveys. “Our best estimate right now is that for every case that’s reported, there actually are 10 other infections,” Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a member of the task force, told reporters Thursday, taking up the estimate of infections to at least 24 million.Blood samples collected for testing antibodies showed that for every confirmed infection there were 10 people with antibodies but no symptoms.“The traditional approach of looking for symptomatic illness, and diagnoses obviously underestimated the total number of infections,” Redfield said. “Now that serology tests are available, which test for antibodies, the estimates we have right now show about 10 times more people have antibodies in the jurisdictions tested than had documented infections.”US treasury department, in the meantime, was reported to have mailed 1 million checks, worth an estimated $1.4 billion of the Covid-19 relief package of $2 trillion for businesses, families and the unemployed, to dead people, according to a watchdog report to US congress. More than160 million Americans received direct payments in all that added up to $269 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-records-nearly-40k-virus-cases-in-a-day-total-cases-10-times-more-than-reported-say-experts/story-CkvuT0LZhJtYHxwxqSs23K.html

This week, AstraZeneca signed its tenth supply and manufacturing deal.“Certainly in terms of how advanced they are, the stage at which they are, they are I think probably the leading candidate,” WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told a news conference. “So it’s possible they will have results quite early.”Swaminathan said Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate was “not far behind” AstraZeneca’s, among more than 200 candidates, 15 of which have entered clinical trials.“We do know that Moderna’s vaccine is also going to go into phase three clinical trials, probably from the middle of July, and so that vaccine candidate is not far behind,” she said.“But I think AstraZeneca certainly has a more global scope at the moment in terms of where they are doing and planning their vaccine trials.”The WHO is in talks with multiple Chinese manufacturers, including Sinovac, on potential vaccines, as well as with Indian researchers, Swaminathan said.She called for drugmakers to consider collaborating on Covid-19 vaccine trials, similar to the WHO’s ongoing Solidarity trial for drugs. A WHO led coalition fighting the pandemic on Friday asked government and private sector donors to help raise $31.3 billion in the next 12 months to develop and deliver tests, treatments and vaccines for the disease. The initiative is called the ACT-Accelerator.Andrew Witty, Special Envoy for the ACT-Accelerator, said it was important to consider a “portfolio of research efforts” for vaccines.“It’s still very early days in this journey, we may be super lucky - which would be terrific - and have an early win,” Witty said. “Even if it takes 12 to 18 months that would be without precedent, the world’s fast development of vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-moderna-ahead-in-covid-19-vaccine-race-world-health-organisation/story-I3hNAWBKx78MIuYYZrxiyO.html

No one else was killed and the incident was not terror related.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was “deeply saddened by the terrible incident in Glasgow”, while home secretary Priti Patel said reports from Glasgow were “deeply disturbing”, and Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the incident was “truly dreadful”.The police said: “A man was shot by armed police and has died. Six other men are in hospital for treatment, including a 42-year-old police officer, who is in a critical but stable condition. The officer’s family is aware”.“The other men in hospital are aged 17, 18, 20, 38 and 53. Liaison officers have been appointed. Our thoughts are with the families of those who were injured, including our officer. The incident is not being treated as terrorism related and our investigation is continuing into the circumstances”, the statement added.The police added that there is no wider risk to the public. Witnesses said they saw a man of African heritage lying on the ground as the police moved in.Sturgeon said: “First and foremost my thoughts are with all those people who have been caught up in this terrible incident, particularly the six injured people taken to hospital for treatment, as well as residents and staff at the hotel”.“While such a serious incident is rare in Scotland it is another reminder of the courage and professionalism of our police officers who are willing to run towards danger in order to protect the lives of others”.“Clearly there is already much speculation around this incident, which remains under investigation. I would urge everyone to avoid such speculation, to not share potentially harmful or upsetting material on social media and to follow police advice while investigations are underway”, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-who-stabbed-3-to-death-in-glasgow-hotel-shot-dead-by-police/story-32FWN3l8q7qS6F8Edy2aVO.html

Local authorities struggled, while residents wanted the beaches closed.Lockdown measures are to be further eased from July 4, amidst concern from experts from the World Health Organisation and others that they are being eased in the UK too soon. The easing has been prompted by dwindling infections in recent days and weeks.Johnson said during a visit to a restaurant in London: “It’s crucial that people understand that on July 4 we get this right - we do this in a balanced way and we recognise the risks”.“And so I say to everybody, you may think that you’re not going to get it and you’re immortal and invincible and so on - and very likely that’s true, particularly if you’re a young person - but the bug you carry can kill elderly people particularly”.“It is still dangerous and the virus is still out there. To win, to beat this thing, we have to stay alert and do this in a balanced way,” he added.Officials said that if scenes similar to those in Bournemouth and elsewhere continued, local lockdowns may have to be imposed.A Downing Street spokesperson said: “Everyone should be able to enjoy the sunshine, and we understand that people want to enjoy public spaces, but it is important we don’t undo the hard work of the British public in reducing the transmission of this virus”.“We have been clear that should we see case numbers increase we will introduce local lockdowns”.As of Thursday evening, the UK had recorded 43,230 deaths and 307,980 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-still-out-there-uk-pm-boris-warns-partying-britons/story-5zhJLVS9sqIEZlste3b0HK.html
26-06-2020||World||Trump wants federal hiring to focus on skills over degrees||President Donald Trump is preparing to direct the federal government to overhaul its hiring to prioritise a job applicant’s skills over a college degree, administration and industry officials say.Trump is set to sign an executive order Friday outlining a new direction for the nation’s largest employer during a meeting of the board that advises the administration on worker policy.Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and adviser, is co-chair of the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board and has worked on improving job training to meet employers’ changing needs.The federal government is the nation’s largest employer with 2.1 million civilian workers, excluding postal service employees.Ivanka Trump predicted the change in federal government hiring would create a more inclusive and talented workforce. She encouraged the private sector to follow the administration’s lead.“We are modernising federal hiring to find candidates with the relevant competencies and knowledge, rather than simply recruiting based on degree requirements,” she told The Associated Press in a statement.  “We encourage employers everywhere to take a look at their hiring practices and think critically about how initiatives like these can help diversify and strengthen their workforce.” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, the board’s other co-chair, said the need for skills training and apprenticeships is as great as it was before the coronavirus pandemic forced millions of people out of work, pushing the national unemployment rate above 13% in May.“Americans are eager to get to work but they need our help,” Ross told AP.The White House isn’t eliminating degree requirements altogether but instead will stress skills in jobs where having a degree is less important.Aides say the change will create more opportunities for Americans to work for the federal government by recognising that some learning happens outside of classrooms.Ivanka Trump and other administration officials have pushed to increase opportunities for apprenticeships and have promoted such training and vocational education as alternatives to traditional two-year or four-year college degree programmes.The Office of Personnel Management will be responsible for implementing the president’s order.IBM is among the companies that have moved in this direction. Last year, 15% of its new US hires had nontraditional backgrounds because they were evaluated based on skills instead of looking only at their degrees, Ginni Rometty, the company’s executive chairman, said via the White House.“We hired from new areas of the country, including under-served communities, and this promoted more diversity in the applications we received,” said Rometty, who is expected to participate in Friday’s meeting.At the meeting, the workforce advisory board is also expected to announce details of a private-sector ad campaign led by Apple, IBM and the nonprofit Ad Council to promote alternate pathways to education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-wants-federal-hiring-to-focus-on-skills-over-degrees/story-gpEPdiLoYWFUquvSgzQXxH.html

26-06-2020||World||New world record set for single lightning flash stretching over 700 kms||A single lightning flash that stretched more than 700 kilometres across Brazil last year - equivalent to the distance between Boston and Washington DC - has created a new world record for the longest reported distance of lightning, the UN’s weather agency has announced.A World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) committee of experts said two new world records for the longest reported distance and the longest reported duration for a single lightning flash were set in Brazil and Argentina. The new records for extreme lightning bursts, or ‘megaflashes’, during 2019, are more than double the size and duration of the previous record flashes.A lightning flash that developed continuously over northern Argentina on March 4, 2019 lasted a whopping 16.73 seconds. A second flash stretched more than 700 kilometres (400 miles) across southern Brazil on October 31 last year. This was equivalent to the distance between Boston and Washington in the US, or between London and Basel in Switzerland.The previous megaflash distance record was 321 km (199.5 miles) in June 2007 across the US state of Oklahoma, and the previous continuous duration record was 7.74 seconds, reached in August 2012 in southern France.The new record-breaking strikes, captured by the American Geophysical Union ahead of International Lightning Safety Day on June 28, were recorded by equipment carried on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites, and their orbiting counterparts from Europe and China.The records were described by Professor Randall Cerveny, chief rapporteur of Weather and Climate Extremes for WMO, as “extraordinary.” “Environmental extremes are living measurements of what nature is capable of, as well as scientific progress in being able to make such assessments,” he said.“It is likely that even greater extremes still exist, and that we will be able to observe them as lightning detection technology improves.” Cerveny said the technology could help scientists better understand the whole science of lightning, and potentially save lives: “This will provide valuable information for establishing limits to the scale of lightning – including megaflashes – for engineering, safety and scientific concerns.” The WMO reiterated the dangers of lightning, and the many lives it claims every year. Lightning flashes have led to major loss of life. In 1975, 21 people in Zimbabwe were killed when a single flash hit the hut in which they were sheltering, and 469 people were killed in Dronka, Egypt in 1994, when lightning tragically struck a set of oil tanks, causing burning oil to flood the town.The official advice from the agency is to follow the 30-30 rule: if the time between flash and thunder is less than 30 seconds, stay inside, and wait 30 minutes after the last observed flash, to resume outdoor activities.Thunderstorms and lightning have wreaked havoc in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh over the past two days, claiming 110 lives, leaving at least 32 injured and causing widespread damage to property, officials in the two states said on Thursday.The lightning strikes were more devastating in Bihar, where 83 people have lost their lives since Wednesday, according to the figures released on Thursday by the Disaster Management Department in Patna.More than 20 people have been injured in these incidents and hospitalised, they said. Meanwhile, in Uttar Pradesh, at least 24 people died when they were struck by lightning on Thursday, while 12 were injured, officials said in Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-world-record-set-for-single-lightning-flash-stretching-over-700-kms/story-iIHHCTLJDU3srkjn4ljpOI.html

And the retail sector, shopping malls, clearly have been feeling the squeeze on their business model for long time.“We’ll do everything can to look after them and to make sure we get young people into work by every possible means,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-take-too-many-liberties-with-covid-guidance-uk-pm-johnson/story-j4FfhQOHmgFzOOllbXT0EL.html
26-06-2020||World||London police to crackdown on illegal parties as officers attacked again||London police will crackdown on illegal street parties after officers came under attack for the second night running as they tried to disperse an unauthorised gathering, the capital’s police chief said on Friday.As Britain has begun to ease strict coronavirus lockdown rules, police have had to deal with a number of illegal parties and raves across the country with many people flouting guidelines that only groups of up to six can meet outdoors.  “It’s hot, some people have drunk far too much, some people are just angry and aggressive, and some are plain violent,” London police chief Cressida Dick said.The events were unlawful and should not be happening, she said, warning: “We will come and close them down.”On Wednesday night, 22 officers were hurt and a number of patrol cars were vandalised when trouble broke out at an unauthorised music event in Brixton, south London.Officers came under attack again on Thursday night from revellers throwing missiles in the Notting Hill area of west London, the scene of one of a number of unlicensed music events, “We’ve seen large numbers of people completely flouting the health regulations, seeming not to care at all about their own or their families’ health, wanting to have large parties,” Dick said.Police will be prepared for further trouble this weekend.“We know that having months of restrictions people have been frustrated and people will want to come together in gatherings but these illegal raves are obviously unacceptable,” Environment Secretary George Eustice told Sky News on Friday.This month, big protests by anti-racism supporters have taken place in central London and other cities in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and some counter-demonstrations, some of which have turned violent.About 140 officers had been injured in the last three weeks, Dick said. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the violence against the police appalling.On Thursday, authorities in Bournemouth, a beach town in southern England, declared a “major incident” over what they called the irresponsible behaviour of crowds who had ignored public health guidance on coronavirus and badly overstretched local services.Visitors arrived in large numbers in a spell of hot weather, resulting in gridlock on the roads, anti-social behaviour and alcohol-fuelled fights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-police-to-crackdown-on-illegal-parties-as-officers-attacked-again/story-7uUyosj2ASPkFYsXs9tmeN.html
26-06-2020||World||South Korea backs remdesivir for Covid-19, urges caution with dexamethasone||South Korea has added Gilead’s anti-viral drug remdesivir to its coronavirus treatment guidelines in its first revision of recommendations since the outbreak began and urged caution in the use of the steroid therapy dexamethasone.South Korea, widely praised around the world for its handling of the pandemic without a full lockdown, has reported 12,602 coronavirus cases as of Thursday midnight, with 282 deaths.Remdesivir is designed to hinder certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, from making copies of themselves and potentially overwhelming the body’s immune system. The drug previously failed trials as an Ebola treatment.South Korea’s updated guidelines come after a study showed that the cheap and widely used dexamethasone reduced deaths in very sick Covid-19 patients. They advised doctors to take caution until a full study is published.“It seems appropriate to administer (dexamethasone), limited to severe cases with acute respiratory syndrome, as the doctor monitors the patient’s condition,” Kim Young-ok, director general of pharmaceutical safety bureau at the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, told a briefing on Friday.There was enough domestic supply of the dexamethasone, widely used since the 1960s, with the production of approximately 43 million tablets and 60 million injection ampoules a year, said Kim.Doctors in Europe will soon be able to treat patients with the drug after the health care regulator’s endorsement put it on track to become the first therapy for the disease on the continent.“An excessive use of dexamethasone can trigger different side effects as it tamps down the immune system along with inflammation, possibly leading to even cataract or glaucoma,” said Dr. Song Dae-sub, professor of pharmacy at Korea University.Korean health authorities also advised the dropping of hydroxychloroquine after a study found the decades-old malaria drug, which U.S. President Donald Trump touted a possible treatment, did not provide any benefit. There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for the coronavirus, which has killed more than 488,467​ people globally, but about a dozen vaccines from more than 100 candidates globally are being tested on humans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-backs-remdesivir-for-covid-19-urges-caution-with-dexamethasone/story-kqa1PJYUfpYIXPNYWbG7DP.html

A vast majority of them are linked to the sprawling Xinfadi market in the city’s south that supplies about 80 percent of Beijing’s fresh produce and meat.The lockdown was eased on Tuesday for seven apartment blocks after residents tested negative for the virus, officials said at a Friday briefing. The remaining blocks are still in lockdown. Eleven new virus cases across Beijing were announced on Friday, bringing the total number of infections in the capital since the June 11 outbreak to 280. Food market workers and visitors, nearby residents, restaurant workers and delivery couriers have been the prime targets of mass testing so far as fears began to mount over the hygiene of Beijing’s food supply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-eases-coronavirus-lockdown-as-mass-testing-gathers-pace/story-RXLI7RvwvMHT06SRHAmNNP.html

26-06-2020||World||Antibody tests may help detect Covid-19 infection if used at right time: Scientists||The timing of Covid-19 antibody test is critical to detect the infection in a patient, scientists have found in the most comprehensive review of the coronavirus testing to date. The researchers examined all available test accuracy evidence for antibody tests published up to the end of April.By combining data from many studies, they have shown that the tests are not accurate enough to confirm whether someone has the Covid-19 virus if used in the first two weeks after the symptoms appear.The researchers found that tests were only likely to be useful in detecting previous SARS-CoV-2 infection if used at least 14 days after the onset of symptoms, but say that studies show that the tests will miss 1 in 10 cases of Covid-19. However, they caution over reliance on this figure, as the studies were small, poorly reported and done in select patient groups.The researchers also fear accuracy will be lower when tests are used in the community, as the tests have mostly been evaluated in hospitalised patients – making it unclear whether they can detect lower antibody levels associated with milder and asymptomatic Covid-19 disease. Led by experts at the University of Birmingham, a group of researchers drawn from universities around the globe have published their findings in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.“We’ve analysed all available data from around the world and discovered clear patterns telling is that timing is vital in using these tests. Use them at the wrong time and they don’t work,” said Jon Deeks, professor of Biostatistics and head of the Test Evaluation Research Group at the University of Birmingham.“There are promising tests, but there isn’t enough evidence to be able to identify the best tests yet, and we need to continue analysing data as it becomes available – particularly from non-clinical settings where individuals are displaying less severe symptoms, and following people over longer time periods,” Deeks said.The immune system of people who have Covid-19 responds to infection by developing cells that can attack the virus (antibodies) in their blood. Tests to detect antibodies in peoples’ blood could show whether they currently have COVID-19 or have had it previously. The body produces three classes of antibody - IgA, IgG and IgM. Most antibody tests measure both IgG and IgM, but some measure a single antibody or combinations of the three antibodies. Levels of antibodies rise and fall at different times after infection, with the IgG antibody usually highest a few weeks after infection. Some tests use venous blood and specialist laboratory equipment, whilst others use finger prick blood samples on disposable devices similar to pregnancy tests, which can be performed in laboratories, hospitals or at home. Researchers searched through over 11,000 publications on Covid-19 available at the end of April 2020, and identified 54 relevant studies from Asia, Europe, and the USA – that measured the accuracy of antibody tests used to detect current or past Covid-19 infection - whether in hospital or the community. In total these studies reported nearly 16,000 test results. “Accurate testing is vital – these tests may help identify Covid-19 in people who have had symptoms for two or more weeks but never had a swab test, and identifying how many have had the SARS-CoV-2 infection to assess disease spread and the need for public health interventions,” the researchers noted.“In time, we will learn whether having previously had the infection provides individuals with immunity to future infection, which will indicate the personal value of having this test,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antibody-tests-may-help-detect-covid-19-infection-if-used-at-right-time-scientists/story-biGa4m0dWmaf7oOp0ISbcO.html
26-06-2020||World||Bhutan says flow of river waters to Assam disrupted by heavy rains||Bhutan on Friday said the supply of river water to Assam has been disrupted because irrigation channels have been affected by heavy monsoon rains, dismissing reports that the flow of water had been deliberately stopped.People familiar with developments in New Delhi said on condition of anonymity that the reports of Bhutan deliberately stopping the supply of water for irrigation in Assam were “not true”.“In fact, the Bhutanese side has categorically denied this, saying they have been carrying out repairs of channels to ensure the smooth flow of water to Assam,” said one of the people cited above.Some reports in the media, mainly in the northeastern states, had said Bhutan had stopped the flow of water through “dongs” or traditional irrigation channels. The reports had said thousands of farmers in Assam’s Baksa and Udalguri districts had been affected as they have been dependent on river water from Bhutan since the 1950s.Reacting to these reports, Bhutan’s foreign ministry said in a statement that authorities, especially in Samdrup Jongkhar district that borders Assam, were working “to ensure that the disruptions caused by the monsoon rains to the irrigation channels are addressed without delay” and water is available for farmers on the Indian side.“Bhutan would like to request for the understanding of the farmers in Assam as sometimes there could be few delays in the flow of water due to disruptions caused by the heavy monsoon rains and the operational difficulties arising from the restrictions put in place by both the countries due to Covid-19,” the statement added.The people cited above said all works along the border had earlier been affected by Bhutan’s strict Covid-19-related restrictions.Bhutan’s statement described allegations about the deliberate stopping of river water as “distressing” and the news reports “totally baseless”. It said there was “no reason why the flow of water should be stopped at this time”. It added that a deliberate attempt was made “by vested interests to spread misinformation and cause misunderstanding between the friendly people of Bhutan and Assam”. Since the lockdown in India and the closure of Bhutan’s borders due to the pandemic, Assamese farmers have been unable to enter Bhutan to maintain irrigation channels as was done in the past, the statement said.“However, understanding the difficulty that would be faced by the farmers in Assam, the Samdrup Jongkhar district officials and the general public have taken the initiative to repair the irrigation channels whenever there are problems to ensure the smooth flow of water to Assam,” it said. Heavy monsoon rains and a sudden rise in water levels, however, are posing serious challenges and Bhutanese authorities, equipped with heavy machinery, are on standby to clear blockages. Authorities in Samdrup Jongkhar are also in close contact with their counterparts in Baksa and Udalguri.“The people of Bhutan, especially those living along the borders of India, deeply value their age-old ties of friendship and cooperation with the people of India, particularly their close neighbours across the borders in Assam and West Bengal. The people of Bhutan feel that such ties of friendship, cooperation and support must continue and be reinforced during these difficult times,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bhutan-says-flow-of-river-waters-to-assam-disrupted-by-heavy-rains/story-ozBM7LM9bJjCVcHqwbUGrI.html
26-06-2020||World||World waking up to China’s true intentions to dominate 5G: US official||The world is waking up to China’s intentions to dominate the 5G telecommunications field amidst the coronavirus pandemic, unrest in Hong Kong, standoff with India and other efforts by Beijing to “conceal, coerce and co-opt the world,” a top American diplomat has said. Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment Keith Krach told reporters that Huawei’s deals with the telecommunications operators around the world are evaporating because countries are only allowing trusted vendors of 5G networks. “It’s really giving the political will to government leaders around the world, and also to corporate leaders,” he said during a news conference on Thursday. “Following the pandemic, Hong Kong, skirmishes at the Indian border, and so many other efforts by Beijing to conceal, coerce, and co-opt the world, it’s waking up the citizens of the world to the Communist Party’s true intentions to dominate 5G. And Huawei’s efforts are running out of steam,” Krach said. In telecommunications, 5G is the fifth generation technology standard for cellular networks, the planned successor to the 4G networks which provide connectivity to most cellphones currently. Spanish multinational telecommunications company Telefónica states in its digital manifesto that security is paramount. Its CEO and chairman Jose Lopez this week declared that “Telefónica is proud to be a Clean Path company, and Telefónica in Spain and the UK are fully clean networks. Telefónica Deutschland and Brazil will be, in the near future, without equipment from any untrusted vendors,” he said. Just a few weeks ago, the big three telcos of Canada decided to partner with Ericsson and Nokia because Canadian public opinion was overwhelmingly against allowing Huawei into the 5G networks. The largest telco companies in major countries around the globe are also becoming “Clean Telcos”, Krach said. “In addition to Telefonica, we’ve seen this with Orange in France, Reliance in India, Telstra in Australia, SK and KT in Korea, Cosmote in Greece, NTT in Japan, and O2 in the United Kingdom,” Krach said, adding that the momentum in favour of securing 5G is building. The more countries, companies and citizens ask whom they should trust with the most sensitive data, the more obvious the answer becomes: not the Chinese Communist Party’s surveillance state, the US diplomat said. Krach said that the UK’s decision to reconsider the use of Huawei and its 5G networks resulted in a dramatic backlash from China. It threatened to punish the British bank HSBC, and pull investment from major British infrastructure projects. “Clearly, the Chinese Communist Party sees much more than mere financial benefit to having Huawei embedded in foreign 5G networks. I think it is no wonder why so many countries are reevaluating their partnerships with Chinese firms and standing up to the Chinese Communist Party’s aggression, like Australia,” he said. Earlier this year, Huawei boasted that it had 91 5G commercial contracts signed. That list has dwindled down to low double digits. Huawei’s deals have evaporated in direct proportion to the threats to retaliate against any country taking steps to protect its citizens and businesses’ most personal, sensitive information, Krach said. “For too long, Beijing bullied other countries and threatened retaliation if it did not get its way. China is a big marketplace, and consequences of retaliation are real. Just ask the people of Norway, who suffered economically for years after the committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize – and they bestowed that prize on a democracy activist who questioned the Communist Party,” he told the reporters. Alleging that the bullying is out of desperation, perhaps fear, he said China is feeling its 5G dream of global domination suddenly slipping through its fingers. “We’ve all had experience with bullies in our lifetime, and if there is one thing we know about bullies, it’s that they back down when they’re confronted. And they really back down when your friends are standing by your side,” Krach added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-waking-up-to-china-s-true-intentions-to-dominate-5g-us-official/story-d7qmGFXjH3MzP8tUHdZSNL.html
26-06-2020||World||Tensions flare over Covid-hit ‘ghetto’ in southern Italy||Italy sent fresh riot police reinforcements Friday to a council estate in its south where a cluster of coronavirus cases among foreign farm workers has sparked tensions with locals.Some 700 people were placed in lockdown this week in the complex of five blocks of flats in Mondragone -- 60 kilometres north of Naples -- for 15 days, the region’s head Vincenzo De Luca said late Thursday.Local health authorities said 43 positive cases had been identified and tests were being carried out on all the residents.Four of the high-rise blocks house undocumented Bulgarian workers while Italian squatters occupy the fifth, De Luca said. The estate is “one of the thousands of ghettos in Italy, where we amass more or less undocumented foreigners to make them live in more or less heinous conditions,” said Corriere della Sera’s editorialist Goffredo Buccini.Fifty army soldiers were sent in to help secure the zone on Thursday after clashes between frustrated Bulgarians who wanted to return to work to earn money for food and angry locals who blamed them for spreading the virus.Hundreds of Bulgarians who came out to demonstrate Thursday were persuaded by police to return inside, but locals who learned they had left the Palazzi Cirio estate then turned up to hurl stones and trash cars, local media reported.Coronavirus tests were being offered to residents living near the estate and if 100 cases surfaced, the whole seaside town would be locked down, De Luca said.He said a few people with the virus had since slipped through the net and disappeared, but insisted surveillance of the estate would be 24 hours non stop from now on.Exploited “The Bulgarian workers... are part of the endless labour force working in the southern countryside without rights, often without contracts, without any security,” organised crime expert Roberto Saviano wrote in the Repubblica daily Friday.“It’s easy in this case to say that those spreading the disease are the foreigners, the invaders, the immigrants, the families of Bulgarian workers accused of going out to continue working,” he said.“But it would have happened the same if it had been Italian workers living in those working conditions, with those wages”.The estate was built decades ago as part of a project to transform Mondragone into the world Mozzarella capital, he said.Furious locals “seem to forget that those workers are essential to the countryside, that without them the (mozzarella-producing) buffaloes would drown in shit and neglect,” he added.It was not the only cluster of new cases in Italy, which lifted its lockdown at the start of June after three months of a pandemic which has officially killed over 34,600 people.At least 64 cases have emerged at a warehouse in Bologna used by express courier Bartolini, including 17 friends and relatives of workers.Italian media identified 10 cases of new clusters across the country this week, including in care homes in Como and Alessandria in the north, and a religious institute in Rome.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tensions-flare-over-covid-hit-ghetto-in-southern-italy/story-DiISV0n9vuaCJLicJEWgzI.html

On May 29, Pakistan recorded 2,429 cases, the lowest.According to the data released by the Ministry of National Health Services, 59 people died due to Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of fatalities to 3,962.So far 84,168 patients have recovered from the disease.Sindh has recorded maximum 75,168 patients followed by Punjab with 71,987, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 24,303, Islamabad 11,981, Balochistan 9,946, Gilgit-Baltistan 1,398 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 962 patients. So far, the authorities conducted 1,193,017 tests including 21,041 tests during the last 24 hours.Meanwhile, Pakistan sought the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) support to develop guidelines for the upcoming Eidul Azha when cattle markets are held across the country to sell animals for sacrifice.Special Assistant to Prime Minister on National Health Services Zafar Mirza during a meeting held on Thursday through video link with WHO Regional Director Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari and his team asked for help to prepare guidelines.Mirza said Pakistan is fighting Covid-19 through a robust and coordinated national response.The purpose of the meeting was to discuss Pakistan’s response to the contagion and to explore areas where the WHO could provide technical guidance and support to help the country fight the virus.Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday defended his government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, saying there has been no confusion or contradiction in the official policies since the start of the disease.“They say again and again that there was confusion ... if there was one country whose government did not have confusion, it was ours,” Khan said while addressing Parliament.He acknowledged about “a lot of pressure” exerted by the Cabinet colleagues to impose a strict lockdown but he refused to follow that path and even faced criticism for that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-records-lowest-single-day-spike-in-covid-19-cases-after-a-month/story-BTdGgKVasyxdm8v6DOZtDN.html
26-06-2020||World||‘Totally baseless’: Bhutan rejects reports on blocking irrigation water to Assam||Bhutan on Friday rejected media reports claiming that it has stopped the supply of irrigation water to farmers in Assam, terming them “totally baseless” and a “deliberate attempt” by vested interests to cause misunderstanding with India. In a statement, Bhutan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that since June 24, 2020, there have been several news articles published in India alleging that Bhutan has blocked water channels that supply irrigation water to Indian farmers in Baksa and Udalguri districts in Assam adjoining the country’s Samdrup Jongkhar district. “This is a distressing allegation and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would like to clarify that the news articles are totally baseless as there is no reason why the flow of water should be stopped at this time,” it said.ALSO WATCH | ‘No dispute, Bhutan helping with clearing water blockage’: Assam Chief Secy  “It is a deliberate attempt by vested interests to spread misinformation and cause misunderstanding between the friendly people of Bhutan and Assam,” the ministry said. Bhutan’s statement came hours after Assam Chief Secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna, in a late night tweet, termed the media reports as incorrect and said that the actual reason was natural blockage. “Recent media reports about Bhutan blocking water supply to India has been incorrectly reported. The actual reason being the natural blockage of informal irrigation channels into Indian fields! Bhutan has been actually helping to clear the blockage,” Krishna said. According to the statement issued on Facebook by Bhutan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Assam’s Baksa and Udalguri districts have been benefitting from the water sources in Bhutan for many decades and “they continue to do so even during the present difficult times when we are faced with the COVID-19 pandemic”. The people of Bhutan, especially those living along the borders of India, “deeply value their age-old ties of friendship and cooperation with the people of India, particularly their close neighbors across the borders in Assam and West Bengal”, it said, adding that such ties of friendship, cooperation and support must continue and be reinforced during these difficult times. Since the lockdown in India and the closure of Bhutan’s borders due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Assamese farmers are unable to enter Bhutan to maintain the irrigation channels as was done in the past, it said. However, understanding the difficulty that would be faced by the farmers in Assam, the Samdrup Jongkhar district officials and the general public have taken the initiative to repair the irrigation channels whenever there are problems to ensure the smooth flow of water to Assam, it said. “The heavy monsoon rains and sudden rise in the water levels is posing serious challenges, but the Bhutanese authorities, including with heavy machinery, are on standby to clear any blockage and channel the water whenever there is a problem,” the statement said. Giving an assurance to the people of Assam, the ministry said that the Royal Government of Bhutan, particularly the Samdrup Jongkhar district authorities, will make every effort to ensure that the disruptions caused by the monsoon rains to the irrigation channels are addressed without delay and there is water available for the farmers in Assam. “Bhutan would like to request for the understanding of the farmers in Assam as sometimes there could be few delays in the flow of water due to disruptions caused by the heavy monsoon rains and the operational difficulties arising from the restrictions put in place by both the countries due to COVID-19,” it said. The Samdrup Jongkhar authorities maintain close contact with their counterparts in Baksa and Udalguri, the ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/totally-baseless-bhutan-rejects-reports-on-blocking-irrigation-water-to-assam/story-sHmcUFjKBBwl1Zde2Hfk8I.html
26-06-2020||World||Germany weighs measures against US over Nord Stream threat||Germany is preparing to strike back against the US if President Donald Trump follows through on his threat to kill off the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline with additional sanctions.Chancellor Angela Merkel’s administration is considering pressing for coordinated European Union action, according to two German officials familiar with the discussions. An economy ministry paper seen by Bloomberg News said such measures by the US would be new and could hit significantly more German and European companies and banks as well as state agencies.The 1,200-kilometer (745 mile) pipeline under the Baltic Sea, designed to pump Russian gas directly to Germany, has triggered deep division between EU member states. But the prospect of a direct US intervention in the 27-member bloc’s energy interests should prompt a collective response, said the officials, who asked not to be identified.The new German strategy adds the possibility of further escalation between the transatlantic allies, with the US this week announcing potential tariffs on $3.1 billion of products from Germany and other European countries. Trump has also reiterated his intention to cut the number of US troops in Germany and renewed a threat to hit the German auto industry with a new set of levies.Flashpoints between the two sides are multiplying as Trump’s reelection campaign runs into trouble and the Covid-19 pandemic threatens to get out of control in the USOn Friday, EU diplomats are holding talks over whether to maintain a ban on US travelers when external border controls begin to lift last week. The officials are aiming to draw up a list of which countries’ nationals will be allowed in and may use infection rates as one of their criteria, which would potentially see the US excluded.In a Twitter post, German Health Minister Jens Spahn pointed to new infections in the US as a sign that the pandemic has yet to peak.The Europeans though are trying to ease the friction over digital taxes after the US pulled out of talks aimed at finding a global agreement on how to tax internet giants like Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. In a letter to US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin seen by Bloomberg News, France, the U.K., Italy and Spain offered to initially limit the tax to automated digital services like search and social media, while excluding retailers like Amazon.Trump has been ramping up his attacks on Germany since Merkel helped to derail his plans for a Group of Seven summit at Camp David this month and Nord Stream, owned by Gazprom PJSC, is a longstanding target. He told a rally last week in Tulsa, Oklahoma that Germany is “delinquent” on defense spending and dispatching “billions” to Vladimir Putin.“We’re supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for energy coming from a pipeline,” Trump said. “Excuse me, how does that work?”US sanctions signed by Trump that targeted pipe-laying vessels in December threw the pipeline’s completion into disarray. While German officials said the project would merely by delayed, new measures proposed by US senators could put Nord Stream in permanent danger, the German officials said.But any response, including sanctions, would have to be weighed carefully, one official said. With Trump’s poll numbers sagging four months ahead of the US presidential election, he could follow through on previous tariff threats -- notably on German autos, the official said.German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier issued a warning over the legality of the new measures earlier this month, signaling that imposing them could bring a new low to transatlantic relations.“The German government has long had the view that sanctions with extraterritorial effects are in conflict with international law and that they’re not a contribution to advancing international cooperation,” Altmaier told reporters in Berlin on June 12. “This position hasn’t changed.”Bundestag lawmakers on the economic affairs committee discussed potential retaliation in a June 17 meeting. The committee chairman, Klaus Ernst of the anti-capitalist Left Party, said parties were in agreement that such measures violated international law.“The government is called upon to develop and put forward proposals for a measured, clear reaction on behalf of Germany and the European Union,” Ernst said in a statement after the closed-door meeting.Pipeline TimingGerman industry is concerned that the new raft of sanctions may prompt counter sanctions in Europe, which it opposes on the strength of US-EU trade ties and traditional allegiances, Michael Harms, the managing director of the BDI lobby’s East European Committee, told reporters last week. Some 670 companies from 25 nations have worked on the pipeline, according to Harms.Gazprom, which has vessels docked off Germany’s Baltic coast, is set on completing the pipeline in the face of US resistance. It made a request with authorities in Copenhagen to operate so-called DP3-class vessels in Danish waters.The Akademik Cherskiy, a vessel that Russia could use to build the remaining stretch of the gas-export link, arrived at a German Baltic port last month after a two-month voyage from the Sea of Japan.The German ministry paper said it was unclear how the Russians planned to proceed with some 150 kilometers remaining for the pipeline but it would need to resume work this summer to complete the work by early 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-weighs-measures-against-us-over-nord-stream-threat/story-gRaY1EBYqMV5t4PRf2jEpK.html

Danish PM forced to postpone wedding again||Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen thought she had finally found a date for her wedding, but has now had to postpone it for a third time due to an EU summit, she said Thursday. Many a wedding plan has been upended by the Covid-19 pandemic and it seems not even world leaders are immune.“I am really looking forward to marrying this fantastic man,” Frederiksen wrote in a Facebook post alongside a photo of herself and her fiance Bo. “But obviously it can’t be that easy, and now there is a council meeting in Brussels called, exactly on that Saturday in July when we had planned to marry,” she wrote.“But I have to do my work and take care of Denmark’s interests. So we have to change plans again.“Soon we should be able to get married. I’m looking forward to saying yes to Bo (who fortunately is very patient).”The extraordinary European Council meeting on July 17-18, which will be held in Brussels in the presence of the 27 heads of the member states, was decided last week at a virtual meeting. It will be the first summit where the leaders will actually be present since the coronavirus lockdown began months ago.During the meeting leaders are set to discuss a recovery plan in response to the Covid-19 crisis and a new EU budget.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fourth-time-lucky-danish-pm-forced-to-postpone-wedding-again/story-0rqUfzjQqo2G6Py6zEzsMJ.html
26-06-2020||World||Chinese ambassador in United States secretly recruited scientists, says FBI||Chinese Ambassador in Washington and a Chinese diplomat in New York city secretly aided in the recruitment of scientists in the United States, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).An affidavit, filed in federal court last year and unsealed in April, gives a deeper look into China’s tactics, Washington Examiner reported. US officials have often expressed concern about Beijing’s espionage capabilities.According to Examiner, the affidavit was first reported by the Daily Beast on Monday and the word ‘China’ is almost entirely redacted from the court filing, though it does appear at least once.An FBI agent who specializes in counterintelligence wrote in the affidavit that the FBI was investigating a scientist in Connecticut who was “knowingly and willfully working in the United States on behalf of government-controlled and government-directed entities for the purpose of recruiting high-level molecular genetics and stem cell stem cell researchers to work at state-controlled universities and laboratories in [China], and for the purpose of acquiring and transferring to those state-controlled universities and laboratories, cutting-edge molecular genetics and stem-cell research and technology developed at leading academic and private-sector research platforms in the United States.”The FBI further pointed out that “those efforts are undertaken ... with the [Chinese] government’s publicly-declared national security objectives of technology transfer and human capital acquisition.”The scientist, whose name was redacted in court documents, became a naturalized US citizen in November 2009 and spent years working in genetic research in America, most recently at a redacted school determined to be Yale University, which told the FBI it had no policy requiring researchers or professors to disclose their involvement with outside entities. The school did not respond to the Washington Examiner’s request for comment.The scientist is now believed to be working at Southern Medical University in China.The Homeland Security Department determined that between October 2017 and October 2018, the scientist spent 300 days outside the US. The FBI affidavit suggested that the professor was associated with China’s Thousand Talents Program, revealing he was associated with efforts to recruit other scientists to share their research with or to work in China.The unredacted version of the affidavit does not name Cui Tiankai, who has been ambassador to the US since 2013, or the diplomat in New York City.The Chinese Embassy denied that its diplomats in the US aided in the recruitment of scientists.“The allegation is nothing but malicious fabrication,” spokeswoman Fang Hong said in a statement to the Washington Examiner.The Justice Department began the China Initiative in 2018 to combat the espionage threat, and the US has arrested and charged a number of scientists who have participated in the Thousand Talents Program.At least 54 scientists have lost their jobs over a failure to disclose financial ties to foreign governments, the National Institutes of Health said earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-ambassador-in-united-states-secretly-recruited-scientists-says-fbi/story-9tPiteQPeUxD3H74R2FTMK.html
26-06-2020||World||Trump administration asks Supreme Court to axe Obamacare||President Donald Trump’s administration late on Thursday asked the US Supreme Court to invalidate the law dubbed Obamacare that, introduced by predecessor, added millions of Americans to the country’s healthcare safety net.The Affordable Care Act (ACA) became invalid after the previous, Republican-led, US Congress axed parts of it, government advocate Noel Francisco argued in a filing to the court.“Nothing the 2017 Congress did demonstrates it would have intended the rest of the ACA to continue to operate in the absence of these three integral provisions,” Francisco said.The Trump administration signalled earlier in the day that it would asked the court to declare the ACA illegal, setting up what is likely to be a key political battleground in this year’s presidential election.The Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier described the move as “unfathomable cruelty” amid the coronavirus outbreak, which has hit the United States harder than any other country.It was the ACA that has prohibited health insurers from denying coverage to Americans with pre-existing health conditions.Trump has criticized healthcare costs and coverage under Obamacare and has been promising since his 2016 campaign to replace it with a different plan.Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden called the bid to overturn the law “cruel, heartless (and) callous”.Democrats expect to make their promise to defend Obamacare a marquee election-year issue after they used a similar strategy in 2018 to win control of the House of Representatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-asks-supreme-court-to-axe-obamacare/story-Mpt9xLgDQGVNL1Xu8MiKOO.html
26-06-2020||World||Multilateral structures like UNSC have teeth but show little or no appetite to bite: UN chief||Multilateral instruments such as the UN Security Council have teeth but “show little or no appetite to bite,” UN chief Antonio Guterres has said as he underlined the need for “effective and inclusive” multilateralism. As the world body on Friday commemorates the 75th anniversary of the adoption of the UN Charter, the founding document of the Organisation, the Secretary General said there is a need to re-imagine the way nations cooperate. “We need a networked multilateralism, bringing together the UN system, regional organisations, international financial institutions and others. And we need an inclusive multilateralism, drawing on the indispensable contributions of civil society, business, cities, regions and, in particular, with greater weight given to the voices of youth,” Guterres said at a virtual press conference Thursday. Underling that in the 21st century, governments are no longer the only political and power reality, he said “we need an effective multilateralism that can function as an instrument of global governance where it is needed.” He pointed out that the problem is not that multilateralism is not up to the challenges the world faces. “The problem is that today’s multilateralism lacks scale, ambition and teeth. And some of the instruments that do have teeth, show little or no appetite to bite, as has recently been the case with the difficulties faced by the Security Council,” he said. Guterres underscored that the international community must give multilateralism the capacities to confront current challenges, not only to meet immediate needs, but to enable future generations to meet theirs. The UNSC has been strongly criticised for its inaction and lack of leadership in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic and its failure to adopt even a single resolution on the global health and humanitarian crisis caused by the outbreak. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for reformed multilateralism and reform of multilateral system as essential to ensure that the international system is inclusive and caters to requirements of all countries, which will in turn facilitate stronger action. Reforming multilateral systems is one of the five key priorities for India when it sits in the Council as a non-permanent member for two years beginning January 2021. India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti has said that as the UN commemorates its 75th anniversary this year, “it is clear to us that United Nations and indeed multilateralism itself need to change to reflect contemporary realities to enable them to remain effective and credible.” Guterres acknowledged that it is difficult to have a meaningful transformation of the mechanisms of global governance without the active participation of the world powers. “Let me blunt, their relationships today have never been more dysfunctional. But I firmly believe that an awakening will come when we recognise our shared fragilities - when the factors that today divide instead begin to force people to finally understand that division is a danger to everyone, starting with themselves,” he said. He said he looks forward to discussing these matters with world leaders during the high-level UN General Assembly session in September in whatever format necessary. “We absolutely must come together to reimagine and reinvent the world we share. In response to questions, the UN chief said while many negative things have happened in the 75 years since the UN founded, “at least the Third World War so many people have predicted was avoided. We had what many called the ‘long peace’ with many small conflicts, but conflicts in which the big powers did not get involved against each other.” While the high-level UNGA week looks all set to be held virtually this year due to Covid-19, Guterres said he hopes that a summit of China, France, Russia, UK and the US - the five permanent members of the Security Council - will be possible before the General Assembly. “It will be very important to address some of the contradictions that still, to a large extent, paralyse very important issues in the Security Council,” he said. The UN chief said he wishes that through the summit, the big powers will understand independently of what divides them, that they need to come together and mobilise the world to defeat the pandemic, defeat climate change, put some order in relation to the cyberspace and create conditions for recovery to a more sustainable and inclusive economy and society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/multilateral-structures-like-unsc-have-teeth-but-show-little-or-no-appetite-to-bite-un-chief/story-hliS7bWks3pdzUn4mBqvNI.html
26-06-2020||World||Crowds at UK beaches stir Covid-19 concern and govt warning||Summer heat saw crowds of daytrippers descend on UK coastal resorts, leading one southern town to declare a major incident and Health Secretary Matt Hancock to warn that he could close beaches to head off any potential new round of coronavirus cases.Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council said emergency services had been overstretched after thousands of people flocked to Bournemouth’s beaches, gridlocking roads. Images posted on social media Thursday showed crowds filling the coastal town to enjoy the hottest day of the year so far.Hancock later told TalkRadio that while he’s “reluctant” to close the beaches, the government has that authority. “We do have those powers, and if we see a spike in the number of cases, then we will take action,” he said. “The virus doesn’t respect the fact that it’s a hot summer’s day. The virus spreads from social contact.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been gradually easing lockdown restrictions, and earlier this week announced that pubs and restaurants will be able to reopen July 4. He also said social distancing rules will be eased, allowing people to come within a meter of those from other households, so long as they take other precautions, such as wearing a face mask.But until July 4, the requirement remains to stay 2 meters apart, something photos on Twitter suggested wasn’t being observed on Bournemouth’s beaches.Covid WarningChief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay, a member of Johnson’s government, said on BBC TV’s “Question Time” program that the scenes from the coastal resort were “very disappointing,” and he urged people to show “common sense” and stay 2 meters apart. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty also showed his concern, warning that cases of the virus may tick upwards again.“COVID-19 has gone down due to the efforts of everyone but is still in general circulation,” Whitty said. “If we do not follow social distancing guidance, then cases will rise again. Naturally people will want to enjoy the sun, but we need to do so in a way that is safe for all.”Over the past two days, Bournemouth council has collected 41 tons of waste from its beaches, according to a statement on its website. Additional police patrols were brought in and overnight campers were evicted, it said.“We are absolutely appalled at the scenes witnessed on our beaches,” Council Leader Vikki Slade said in the statement. “The irresponsible behavior and actions of so many people is just shocking, and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe. We have had no choice now but to declare a major incident and initiate an emergency response.”RecoveryNationwide, still more than 1,000 people a day are testing positive for the virus, and the latest daily figures showed 149 deaths Wednesday.Even so, the government’ focus is shifting to getting the economy moving again after the three-month lockdown plunged the economy into recession and left the state paying the wages of almost 12 million private-sector jobs.Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak “will give a statement in July which will be all about the next phase, talking about how we green the economy, how we respond with the infrastructure projects,” Barclay, the No. 2 at the Treasury, told “Question Time.”“Jobs, particularly for young people, is one of the key challenges before us, and that’s very much what we’re focused on in the Treasury at the moment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crowds-at-uk-beaches-stir-covid-19-concern-and-govt-warning/story-G0WS7pAww4QWVERIhrjeXP.html
26-06-2020||World||Trump zeroes in on base to overcome reelection obstacles||President Donald Trump is sharpening his focus on his most ardent base of supporters as concern grows inside his campaign that his standing in the battleground states that will decide the 2020 election is slipping.Trump turned his attention this week to “left wing mobs” toppling Confederate monuments and visited the nation’s southern border to spotlight progress on his 2016 campaign promise to build a US-Mexico border wall.He ignored public health experts warning Americans to avoid large gatherings by holding two large campaign events in Oklahoma and Arizona, parts of the country where coronavirus infections are surging.With his rhetorical turn, Trump is feeding red meat issues to a base that helped spur his upset victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016. But he risks appearing to ignore larger issues that are jolting the country, like the pandemic and racial injustice, while underplaying economic issues, even though polling shows that to be an area where Trump performs relatively well.“This might be the only path for him at this point,” said Dan Schnur, who served as a campaign adviser to Arizona Sen. John McCain and California Gov. Pete Wilson. “Most of the center is no longer available to him. Motivating his base is not just his best available strategy. It might be the only one.”The president’s advisers believe there are few undecideds when it comes to Trump, with only a sliver of voters who may change their mind and warm to him. The more effective use of resources is to make sure those who like him turn out to vote, according to campaign and White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal strategy.Trump takes a measure of comfort in the fact that he found himself in a similar position in 2016. Polls throughout his race against Clinton showed him with a deficit, often just as wide as some polls now suggest, before he closed that gap in the final days of the campaign as the base coalesced around him.As he did with Clinton, Trump has tried to drive up Democratic rival Joe Biden’s negatives, pushing unsubstantiated claims about his mental acuity and his son Hunter’s business dealings. But Trump so far has had little success in driving Biden into the deeply negative territory where Clinton found herself.Biden’s campaign is confident that the circumstances for Trump, who now has a well-established political record, have complicated his ability to drag down his opponent with a barrage of attacks.“The reality is this is a different election than 2016 was,” said Symone Sanders, a senior adviser to the Biden campaign. “In 2016, a lot of voters went to the polls asking what kind of president Trump would be. It’s no longer a theory of what kind of president Donald Trump will be.”Trump hopes to get as much of that base to turn out while persuading the voters who have shown tepid enthusiasm for Biden to stay home. Indeed, while many national and battleground polls show Trump trailing Biden, surveys have suggested that some of the former vice president’s support is lukewarm.Trump’s team feels confident that approximately 40% of the electorate supports him and notes his approval rating has remained unusually stable during his term. The president’s campaign advisers believe it comes down to getting a bigger proportion of the smaller group of people who love Trump to turn out than the larger group of voters who express tepid support for Biden.With that in mind, the campaign has renewed its focus on plays to please the base. Among them: the border wall and other hard-line immigration executive orders; a promise to produce a list of conservative Supreme Court nominees; public consideration of acknowledging Israel’s annexation of parts of the West Bank to satisfy evangelicals; and, most strikingly, a focus on reopening the nation’s economy over publicly dwelling on the pandemic.South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of Trump’s closest allies in Congress, said Trump can win with “a little more message discipline” and a focus on policies that separate him and Biden.“Just make it more about policy and less about your personality,” Graham told reporters.Last weekend, Trump held a big-arena rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that drew a relatively sparse crowd for a president who is used to overflow audiences. He then took part on Tuesday in a jam-packed event at a Phoenix megachurch — albeit in a smaller venue — for young conservatives. Both are the sort of events that Trump is counting on helping him turn the tide.“Nov. 3 is a big day,” Trump told attendees at a Students for Trump event in Phoenix. “Get out. Get the parents, get the friends, get the husband, get the wife, get everybody.”Arizona has emerged as a growing hot spot for the virus, and Phoenix’s Democratic mayor, Kate Gallego, implored that such an event — most participants declined to wear masks and didn’t practice social distancing — could not be safely carried out.Karen Kedrowski, a political scientist at Iowa State University, said such events help Trump echo ardent conservatives’ frustrations that the lockdown has lasted too long. But Trump’s attempt to amplify his message through mass gatherings is perilous.“The president sees the need to electrify his base,” Kedrowski said. “But what happens to the president if two weeks from now rally attendees are becoming sick and spreading the virus in their communities?”During the event, Trump, who had stirred up controversy by using the racist phrase “kung flu” to describe COVID-19, was reflecting on the many names he’s heard the coronavirus called.When he heard the pejorative yelled from the crowd, Trump smiled and said it, too. The audience roared in approval.Biden surrogates, including vice presidential contender Sen. Tammy Duckworth, called out Trump for it. Still, Biden is being careful not to get dragged into a culture war.“We have not let Donald Trump’s antics distract us from our message,” Sanders said. “At the same time, we’re not going to sit back and allow him to disparage large swaths of the electorate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-zeroes-in-on-base-to-overcome-reelection-obstacles/story-2qTDaI1XOP9NPMV62iapGK.html
26-06-2020||World||Protesters raise demand to remove statues of slave kneeling before Lincoln||Calls are intensifying for the removal of twin Emancipation memorials in Washington, DC, and Boston that depict a freed slave kneeling at Abraham Lincoln’s feet — optics that jar and offend many in a nation confronting racial injustice through a fresh lens.The Emancipation Memorial, also known as the Emancipation Group and the Freedman’s Memorial, was erected in Washington’s Lincoln Park in 1876. Three years later, a copy was installed in Boston, home to the statue’s white creator, Thomas Ball.Protesters gathered earlier this week to demand the removal of the original in Washington, where the Army activated about 400 unarmed National Guard personnel ahead of calls circulating on social media to tear it down Thursday evening.And in Boston, where a petition is circulating for the copy to be taken down, the city’s arts commission is holding public hearings Thursday and next Tuesday to discuss its fate.What originally was intended in 1876 to celebrate liberation, critics contend, looks more like subservience and supremacy in 2020.“I’ve been watching this man on his knees since I was a kid,” said Tory Bullock, a Black actor and activist leading the campaign to get the Boston memorial removed.“It’s supposed to represent freedom but instead represents us still beneath someone else. I would always ask myself, “If he’s free, why is he still on his knees?’” Bullock said.The memorial has been on Boston’s radar at least since 2018, when it launched a comprehensive review of whether public sculptures, monuments and other artworks reflected the city’s diversity and didn’t offend communities of color. The Boston Art Commission said it was paying extra attention to works with “problematic histories.”Black donors paid for the original in Washington; white politician and circus showman Moses Kimball financed the copy on a downtown square a block away from Boston Common. The inscription on both reads: “A race set free and the country at peace. Lincoln rests from his labors.”But Blacks weren’t part of the design process, and the memorial’s central visual takeaway — a Black man with broken shackles kneeling before his white savior, with a whipping post and chains in the background — has had people cringing for years.“How can you say you care about Black lives and then leave a statue up for decades that actually promotes a disgusting and demeaning image of those very lives?” asked Lilian McCarthy, among more than 12,000 people who signed Bullock’s petition.Similar scorn has dogged the original in Washington since it was unveiled. At its dedication nearly a century and a half ago, abolitionist and Black statesman Frederick Douglass spoke critically of the freed slave’s depiction as kneeling before Lincoln.President Donald Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Thursday, “I can see controversy but I can also see beauty” in the Emancipation Memorial in Washington. Trump suggested that activists who want to see certain memorials removed should petition government.“You know, we can take things down, too,” Trump said. “I can understand certain things being taken down. But they ought to go through a process, legally. And then we take it down, in some cases put ’em in museums or wherever they may go.”But Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District’s non-voting delegate in the U.S. House, said the monument ignores the fact that Black Americans played a pivotal role in securing their own freedom.“Blacks too fought to end enslavement,” Norton tweeted this week, saying she was introducing a bill to move the statue to a museum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protesters-raise-demand-to-remove-statues-of-slave-kneeling-before-lincoln/story-KMxc8hUtryMKkgZWNZyDmO.html
26-06-2020||World||No reason for any country to include coal in Covid-19 recovery plans: UN Chief||A week after India launched the auction process for coal blocks for commercial mining, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said there is no reason for any country to include coal in their Covid-19 recovery plans and investments should instead be made in non-polluting energy sources. Guterres on Thursday presented the United Nations Response on Covid-19 that documents not only the action taken by the world body over the last three months of the pandemic, but also offers a roadmap toward recovering better. “We cannot go back to the way it was and simply recreate the systems that have aggravated the crisis. We need to build back better with more sustainable, inclusive, gender-equal societies and economies,” Guterres said in remarks during a virtual press conference. “There is no good reason, for example, for any country to include coal in their Covid-19 recovery plans. This is the time to invest in energy sources that don’t pollute, don’t cause emissions, generate decent jobs and save money,” the UN Chief said, adding that the United Nations is strongly committed to leading the renewal. While Guterres did not name any country, sources in the UN said the remark was in reference to the decision by India to launch the auction process for coal blocks for commercial mining. India’s decision raises concern as other countries could also use coal to meet energy requirements as economies come out a Covid-19 lockdown, they said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had last week launched the auction process for 41 coal blocks for commercial mining, a move that opens India’s coal sector for private players, and termed it a major step in the direction of India achieving self-reliance. Launching the auction of mines for commercial mining, that is expected to garner Rs 33,000 crore of capital investment in the country over next five to seven years, the prime minister had said India will win the coronavirus war and turn the crisis into an opportunity, and that the pandemic will make India self-reliant. Presently, despite being the world’s fourth largest producer, India is the second largest importer of the dry-fuel, Modi had said. “Allowing private sector in commercial coal mining is unlocking resources of a nation with the world’s fourth-largest reserves,” he had pointed out. He had said that the launch of the auction process not only marked the beginning of unlocking of the country’s coal sector from the lockdown of decades, but aimed at making India the largest exporter of coal. The commencement of auction process of these blocks is part of the series of announcements made under ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ or self-reliant India Mission to revive the Indian economy impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. In Bangkok last November, Guterres had stressed on the need to stop the creation of new power plants based on coal in the future, adding that there are still several new coal power plants for electricity production foreseen in the future in East Asia, in Southeast Asia and in South Asia. “There is an addiction to coal that we need to overcome because it remains a major threat in relation to climate change,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-reason-for-any-country-to-include-coal-in-covid-19-recovery-plans-un-chief/story-0PoyndfB8UO4g4gIvyDRRL.html

26-06-2020||World||Religious, ethnic minorities highly vulnerable to trafficking in Pakistan: US report||Asserting that Pakistan did not demonstrate overall increasing efforts to eliminate human trafficking, the United States has downgraded Islamabad to the ‘Tier 2 Watch List’ on the country trafficking scale. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday released the US State Department Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report for the year 2020. The report stated that religious minorities and children in Pakistan are highly vulnerable to trafficking. The report also highlighted that terrorist groups in Pakistan kidnap children as young as 12 and force them to spy, fight and conduct suicide attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan.“Pakistan is a destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labour--particularly from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Refugees and stateless persons from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Burma, as well as religious and ethnic minorities such as Christians and Hazaras, are particularly vulnerable to traffickers in Pakistan,” the report read. “Non-state militant groups kidnap children as young as 12, buy them from destitute parents, coerce parents with threats or fraudulent promises into giving their children away, or recruit children from madrassas; these armed groups force children to spy, fight, and conduct suicide attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Traffickers have promised Pakistani boys admittance to Afghan religious schools but sold them to members of the Afghan security forces for bacha bazi,” the report added. The report acknowledged that the Pakistan government does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so.“Unlike the previous reporting period, the government did not take action against credible reports of official complicity in trafficking, and organizations reported official complicity and corruption led to several high-profile trafficking cases being dropped during the year. The government continued to lack overall adequate resources for victim care, and only referred four per cent of all victims identified to care. Therefore Pakistan was downgraded to Tier 2 Watch List,” the report noted.‘Tier 2 Watch List’ is a category denoting a country those meriting special scrutiny, on the grounds that it had failed to enact legislation to fully criminalize trafficking. The report highlighted that the Pakistan government did not report any efforts to address local government officials’ reportedly “endemic perpetuation of bonded labour, which created a culture of impunity for offenders”.“Feudal landlords and brick kiln owners used their political connections to facilitate their use of forced labour. In some cases, when bonded labourers attempted to escape or seek legal redress, police refused to file a case and returned bonded labourers to their traffickers,” the report stated. The report said that Labour inspectors, who are front-line officials to inspect and identify forced and bonded labour, had inadequate training to identify indicators of trafficking, insufficient funding to conduct inspections, and a lack of standard procedures to refer potential forced and bonded labour cases to police.“Despite high incidences of child and forced labour in agriculture and domestic work, the majority of provincial labour laws did not allow labour inspectors to inspect these worksites for infractions,” the report read.Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report sorts countries into four tiers -- Tier-1, Tier-2, Tier-2 watchlist, and Tier-3-- based on their efforts to fight trafficking. Countries whose governments fully meet the TVPA’s (Trafficking Victims Protection Act) minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking are categorised as Tier-1.Those countries whose governments do not fully meet the TVPA’s minimum standards but are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards are put under Tier-2.Pompeo said that the US denied “certain kinds of assistance” to countries that were ranked in the Tier-3 category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/religious-ethnic-minorities-highly-vulnerable-to-trafficking-in-pakistan-report/story-iWCb7570AblWpDl8W5OtcP.html

26-06-2020||World||Israel and UAE to announce partnership to combat Covid: Israeli PM Netanyahu||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that his government and the United Arab Emirates will soon announce a partnership in the fight against the coronavirus.The deal, which the UAE later said involved two private companies, comes despite recent warnings from UAE officials that Israel’s planned annexation of parts of the occupied West Bank would harm its efforts to improve relations with Arab states.In a speech to graduating Israeli fighter pilots, Netanyahu said an announcement was expected “in a few moments” and came after months of “intense contacts.” “This collaboration will be in the fields of research and development, technology, in areas that will improve the confidence in health throughout the region,” he said.The Emirates’ state-run WAM news agency later published an item acknowledging two private firms signed a deal with two Israeli companies “to develop research and technology to fight Covid-19,” the illness caused by the coronavirus. The announcement did not name the firms.“As a result of the pandemic’s spread worldwide, it is imperative to place the protection of humanity at the forefront of global action to overcome this unprecedented crisis,” WAM said.It’s unclear what that research will involve. The UAE has been working closely with China on the virus.Israel and the UAE, home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, do not have formal diplomatic relations, but they are believed to maintain close behind-the-scenes contacts because of their shared concerns about Iran.Earlier this month, the UAE’s ambassador to the United States published an op-ed in an Israeli newspaper confirming that ties had improved but warning Israel that proceeding with annexation would “upend” any efforts to normalise relations with Arab states.“Annexation will certainly and immediately upend Israeli aspirations for improved security, economic and cultural ties with the Arab world and with UAE,” Ambassador Yousef al-Otaiba wrote.However, last week, another leading UAE official said it was open to cooperating with Israel on efforts to combat the coronavirus and other humanitarian issues despite the political disagreement over annexation.“Can I have a political disagreement with Israel but at the same time try and bridge other areas of the relationship? I think I can,” Anwar Gargash, the UAE’s minister of state for foreign affairs, said in an interview with the American Jewish Committee advocacy group.Last month, the UAE sent a cargo plane to Israel loaded with coronavirus-related aid it said was destined for the Palestinians. The Palestinian Authority said it could not receive the aid because there had been no prior coordination.Netanyahu has vowed to annex all of Israel’s far-flung settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley, which together amount to around 30% of the occupied West Bank. President Donald Trump’s Middle East plan endorsed the move, which has been rejected by the Palestinians and much of the international community.Israel could begin the annexation process as soon as July 1, but the Trump administration may apply the brakes in an effort to revive peace negotiations. The UAE is a close and influential US military ally.Opponents of annexation say it would make it virtually impossible to create a viable Palestinian state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza, territories seized by Israel in the 1967 war. A two-state solution is still widely seen as the only way of resolving the conflict.Netanyahu has boasted of quietly improving ties with Arab states, but full normalisation still appears unlikely without a resolution of the conflict with the Palestinians.Jordan and Egypt are the only two Arab countries to have made peace with Israel. Jordan, another close US ally, is staunchly opposed to any annexation, saying it would cause a “massive conflict.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-and-uae-to-announce-partnership-to-combat-covid-israeli-pm-netanyahu/story-c1fNnKtpInmYTmWItgH9mN.html
26-06-2020||World||Lawmaker slams Trump for donating ventilators to select countries||A top Democratic Senator has alleged that the Trump administration’s expenditure of more than USD200 million to donate ventilators during Covid-19 pandemic is allegedly favouring countries personally selected by the US President. Among the countries that have been provided the life-saving machines are Russia, India, and South Africa, said Senator Robert Menendez, Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “Given the scale and nature of the current (Covid-19) crisis, it is imperative that we ensure the effective use of US aid dollars,” he wrote in a letter to Donald Trump, citing the administration’s suspect decision to waive congressional notification requirements for sending the ventilators during the pandemic. “Providing ventilators to countries that need them is critical, but, as with any assistance, must be done in a productive and transparent manner. To that end, the National Security Council (NSC), in cooperation with the US Agency for International Development (USAID), must ensure greater transparency and accountability around the provision of ventilators,” he said. Menendez alleged that without a fulsome explanation for USAID’s procurement and provision of ventilators to a select group of countries, Trump’s orders to ship more than 7,500 ventilators abroad, to just 40 countries, exemplifies the potential transactional politicisation of US foreign assistance and risks further tarnishing USAID’s reputation as an apolitical aid agency. Reiterating his concerns in a separate letter to USAID Acting Administrator John Barsa, Menendez called for further transparency regarding the respective roles of USAID and the NSC in the distribution decision-making process and the US government’s efforts to ensure that Covid patients abroad have equitable access to life-saving ventilators.To date, USAID has submitted two Congressional Notifications (CN) outlining the Administration’s plans to spend approximately USD 202 million in Global Health Program, Emergency Reserve Funds and Economic Support Funds, provided by the CARES Act, to purchase 7,582 ventilators to distribute to up to 40 countries, Menendez to Acting Administratior Barsa. “While the notifications provide some details, I am concerned that the NSC’s influence on these decisions both circumvents longstanding USAID procurement and accountability policies and interjects political agendas into how USAID allocates it Global Health and Emergency Reserve Fund resources,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawmaker-slams-trump-for-donating-ventilators-to-select-countries/story-SuUwbEXQApThNm3bDnT08I.html
26-06-2020||World||China used Covid-19 to lash out in every direction: US Senator||Stating that China continues its premeditated military incursion along the border with India, a top American Senator has alleged that Beijing has used the Covid-19 pandemic to lash out in every direction. “China in particular has used the pandemic to lash out in every direction. They’ve antagonized and harassed Taiwanese, Malaysian, Vietnamese, and Indonesian vessels in the South China Sea; and used every tool in their shed to coerce Australia into silence about Covid-19,” alleged Senator Jim Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “And now 20 Indian soldiers are dead – some killed by what are essentially baseball bats with spikes – as China continues its premeditated military incursion along the border with India,” Inhofe said on the Senate floor in support of the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2021. The National Defense Authorization Act for 2021 is all about sending a message to China and Russia, he said. It says, “There is no way you can defeat us — so don’t even try.” “We know that the way we preserve peace is by demonstrating our strength. We have the best military in the world — and our enemies need to know that. But we can’t rest on our laurels. We must implement the National Defense Strategy because our comparative military advantage is at risk right now. China and Russia are catching up to us — and quickly,” Inhofe said. China and Russia have invested in their military, he said, adding that the two have willfully mislead on many things – including the actual size of their defense budgets. Russia’s is almost three times larger than most people think. Because of these investments, China and Russia have grown not just the size of their military but their capabilities as well. “Last October, China paraded a hypersonic weapon, showing off a technology we don’t even have yet,” he added. “Their investments aren’t restricted by their borders. I’ve seen their build-up in action across the world. One prime example: China just built its first overseas military base – in Djibouti, right on one of the world’s most important maritime routes,” Inhofe said. “I saw it firsthand: China is trying to take control of more than 40 ports in sub-Saharan Africa. Now, we see China and Russia grow more and more aggressive and antagonistic,” said the top American Senator. Aimed at China, the bill among other things, establishes the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, which will focus resources on the Indo-Pacific - addressing key military capability gaps, reassuring its allies and partners, and bolstering its credibility, Inhofe said. “The bill ensures we have a combat-credible forward posture and helps us develop and field the joint capabilities needed to take on the conflicts envisioned by the NDS. We push back on China’s and Russia’s attempts to expand their influence by building new alliances and partnerships and strengthening existing ones,” he said. “We protect against intrusion from China and Russia – in space, cyberspace, and beyond. We safeguard proprietary technology and intellectual property from being infiltrated by the government of China. We also reduce our reliance on foreign countries like China as a source for a variety of materials and technologies, including microelectronics and rare earth minerals – but also medical devices and pharmaceuticals,” the Senator said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-used-covid-19-to-lash-out-in-every-direction-us-senator/story-ymoUjlIIwhXG5nMBn0NqoO.html
26-06-2020||World||Huawei executive trial: Justin Trudeau rejects calls to stop extradition in exchange of 2 Canadians||Implying that the country will not succumb to hostage diplomacy, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has rebuffed a letter from a group including four former federal ministers, that asked him to have an extradition trial against a senior Huawei executive in Vancouver stopped so she could return to China in exchange for the release of two Canadians imprisoned there.During his daily media briefing, Trudeau said the letter writers were “wrong in their approach”. Expanding on the issue, he said that if countries around the world, including China, believed that “by arbitrarily arresting random Canadians” they could influence Canada politically, that would leave a “lot more Canadians who travel around the world vulnerable to that kind of pressure.”Trudeau’s rebuff came as 13 Canadian senators sought to have sanctions imposed upon Chinese officials involved in human rights violations targeting Muslim Uighurs, Tibetans and residents of Hong Kong.Trudeau was referring to the ongoing trial of Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Chinese telecommunications company Huwaei and daughter of its founder. She is facing trial in Vancouver and could potentially be extradited to the US on charges related to committing fraud and bypass international sanctions against the Iranian regime. Days after she was detained in Vancouver in December 2018, two Canadians including a former diplomat, were arrested by Chinese authorities, who charged them with spying last week.“We need to continue to be absolutely crystal clear that Canada has an independent judiciary and those processes will unfold independently of any political pressure, including by foreign governments,” Trudeau said, according to the outlet CBC. “We deplore what China did,” he added. The letter writers include three former foreign ministers and a former justice minister, among others. “I respect these distinguished Canadians who put forward that letter but I deeply disagree with them,” Trudeau said.Meanwhile, in another letter to Trudeau, Canadian senators have asked him to respond to China’s “tyrannical behaviour” by imposing sanctions upon Chinese officials for “gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms,” according to CBC.Those sanctions can be imposed under Canada’s Sergei Magnitsky Law, named after a Russian expert who was killed by authorities in Moscow over exposing fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huawei-executive-trial-justin-trudeau-rejects-calls-to-stop-extradition-in-exchange-of-2-canadians/story-th7hLFruXmNM71ZkI6pWYM.html
26-06-2020||World||US officials change virus risk groups, add pregnant women||The nation’s top public health agency on Thursday reset its list of which Americans are at higher risk for severe Covid-19 illness, adding pregnant women and removing age alone as a factor.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also altered the list of underlying conditions that make someone more susceptible to suffering and death. Sickle cell disease joined the list, for example. And the threshold for risky levels of obesity was lowered.The changes didn’t include adding race as a risk factor for serious illness, despite accumulating evidence that Black people, Hispanics and Native Americans have higher rates of infection, hospitalization and death.Agency officials said the update was prompted by medical studies published since CDC first started listing high-risk groups. They also sought to publicize the information before Independence Day weekend, when many people may be tempted to go out and socialize.“For those at higher risk, we recommend limiting contact with others as much as possible, or restricting contacts to a small number of people who are willing to take measures to reduce the risk of (you) becoming infected,” said CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield.The same advice holds for people who live with or care for people at higher risk, Redfield added.Previously, the CDC said those at high risk of serious illness included people aged 65 years and older; those who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility; and people with serious heart conditions, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic lung disease, and conditions that leave them with weakened immune systems.In the changes, CDC created categories of people who are at high risk and people who might be at high risk.Those who are at high risk include people with chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammatory lung disease, obesity, serious heart conditions, sickle cell disease, Type 2 diabetes, and weakened immune systems because of organ transplants. The threshold for obesity concern was lowered from a body mass index of 40 down to 30.The CDC said people are at increasing risk as they get older, but it removed people 65 and older as a high risk group.The list of people who might be at high risk includes pregnant women, smokers and those with asthma, diseases that affect blood flow to the brain, cystic fibrosis, high blood pressure, dementia, liver disease, scarred or damaged lungs, Type 1 diabetes, a rare blood disorder called thalassemia, and people who have weakened immune systems due to HIV or other reasons.Pregnant women joined the list on the same day a CDC report found they accounted for about 9% of lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases in women of childbearing age. About 5% of women of childbearing age are pregnant at any given time.The report showed that pregnant women had higher rates of hospitalization, of admission to a hospital intensive care unit and of winding up on a breathing machine vs. young women who weren’t pregnant. There was no clear evidence of a higher death rate among pregnant women, however.It’s not completely surprising, said Dr. Denise Jamieson, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at the Emory University School of Medicine. Pregnant women have been found to be at higher risk from other infectious respiratory diseases, likely because the lungs decrease in the volume as the uterus grows, Jamieson said.What is surprising, she said, is that CDC didn’t place pregnant women in the highest risk category.“To me this is the most compelling evidence to date that pregnant women are at increased risk,” said Jamieson, who spent 20 years at CDC as a reproductive health expert.Earlier this week, CDC officials called on a panel of experts to help them identify groups that should be prioritized for coronavirus vaccinations if one becomes available and supplies are limited.Pregnant women could be among that group. So could certain racial and ethnic groups.CDC officials shared data with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices that showed, compared with white Americans, coronavirus hospitalization rates were 4 times higher for Hispanics, 4.5 times higher for Black people, and 5.5 higher for American Indians and Alaska Natives. A recent study in the Atlanta area suggested that being Black was as large a risk for hospitalization as having diabetes, being a smoker or being obese.“If we fail to address racial and ethnic groups as at high risk for prioritization, whatever comes out of our group will be looked at very suspiciously and with a lot of reservation,” said Dr. Jose Romero, chair of the expert panel.“They are groups that need to be moved to the forefront,” he said.CDC officials say they expect to come out with recommendations for racial and ethnic minority groups soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-officials-change-virus-risk-groups-add-pregnant-women/story-iSOECGKpLsjl9sRPrPfxGJ.html

So this will be, when discovered, hoping that it will be discovered, it will be the first one,” he said.He said the WHO had already more than a 100 candidates for a vaccine of which one was at an advanced stage of development.“Hoping that there will be a vaccine, the estimate is we may have a vaccine within one year. If accelerated, it could be even less than that, but by a couple of months.

26-06-2020||World||‘Elaborate and sophisticated fraud’: Wirecard collapses owing $4 billion to creditors||Wirecard collapsed on Thursday owing creditors almost $4 billion after disclosing a gaping hole in its books that its auditor EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud.The payments company filed for insolvency at a Munich court saying that, with 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) of loans due within a week its survival as a going concern was “not assured”.Wirecard’s implosion came just seven days after EY, its auditor for more than a decade, refused to sign off on the 2019 accounts, forcing out Chief Executive Markus Braun and leading it to admit that $2.1 billion of its cash probably didn’t exist.“There are clear indications that this was an elaborate and sophisticated fraud involving multiple parties around the world,” EY said in a statement.EY said while it was completing the 2019 audit, it was provided with false confirmations with regard to escrow accounts and reported them to the relevant authorities.Wirecard declined to comment following EY’s statement.The financial technology company is the first member of Germany’s prestigious DAX stock index to go bust, barely two years after winning a spot among the country’s top 30 listed companies with a market valuation of $28 billion.“The Wirecard case damages corporate Germany. It should be a wake-up call for reforms,” said Volker Potthoff, chairman of corporate governance think-tank ArMID.Creditors have scant hope of getting back the 3.5 billion euros they are owed, sources familiar with the matter said. Of that total, Wirecard has borrowed 1.75 billion from 15 banks and issued 500 million in bonds.“The money’s gone,” said one banker. “We may recoup a few euros in a couple of years but will write off the loan now.”‘TOTAL DISASTER’The collapse of Wirecard, once one of the hottest fintech companies in Europe, dwarfs other German corporate failures. It has shaken the country’s financial establishment with Felix Hufeld, head of regulator BaFin, calling it a “total disaster”.German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz described the collapse as a “scandal”, acknowledging it was time to review regulation. “We must rethink our supervisory structures,” said Scholz, adding he had asked his ministry to come up with ideas in the next few days.“If legal, legislative, regulatory measures are needed, we will embrace them and implement them,” he said. “A scandal like Wirecard is a wake-up call that we need more monitoring and oversight than we have today,” he said.Wirecard shares, which were suspended ahead of an earlier announcement that it would seek creditor protection, crashed 80% when trading resumed. They have lost 98% since auditor EY questioned its accounts last Thursday.EY, one of the world’s “Big Four” accountancy and consulting firms, faces a wave of litigation in a debacle that has drawn comparisons with Arthur Andersen’s disastrous oversight of U.S. energy company Enron.German law firm Schirp & Partner said that with Wirecard now effectively sidelined, it would file class actions against EY on behalf of shareholders and bondholders.“It is frightening how long Wirecard AG was able to operate without being objected to by the auditors,” partner Wolfgang Schirp said.Wirecard’s new management had been in crisis talks with creditors but pulled out on Thursday morning “due to impending insolvency and over-indebtedness”.The insolvency filing did not include its Wirecard Bank subsidiary, which holds an estimated 1.4 billion euros in deposits and is already under emergency management by BaFin.‘COMPLETE VINDICATION’A second source close to talks with creditors said although the company had a healthy core, it had faked two-thirds of its sales. This meant there was no way it could repay all its debt, notwithstanding all the legal challenges it will face.The ascent of Wirecard, which was founded in 1999 and is based in a Munich suburb, was dogged by allegations from whistleblowers, reporters and speculators that its revenue and profits had been pumped up through fake transactions.Braun fended off the critics for years before finally calling in outside auditor KPMG late last year to run an independent investigation.KPMG, which published its findings in April, was unable to verify 1 billion euros in cash balances, questioned Wirecard’s acquisition accounting and said it could not trace hundreds of millions in cash advances to merchants.“Today is a complete vindication for those that exposed the fraud,” said Fraser Perring, who bet on a fall in Wirecard’s shares and co-authored a 2016 report that alleged fraud.The Munich prosecutor’s office, which is investigating Braun on suspicion of misrepresenting Wirecard’s accounts and of market manipulation, said: “We will now look at all possible criminal offences.”Braun was arrested on Monday and released on bail of 5 million euros a day later. Former chief operating officer Jan Marsalek is also under suspicion and believed to be in the Philippines, according to justice officials there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elaborate-and-sophisticated-fraud-wirecard-collapses-owing-4-billion/story-CmIKncq5NZCPbGwEOwFAgP.html

Speaking in parliament on Thursday amid rising criticism of his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, Khan connected the issue to the US criticism of Pakistan’s role in the war on terror. “They came into our country and killed Osama Bin Laden, martyred him, all the world criticised us instead.” Khan said Pakistan supported the war on terror but US continued to blame Pakistan. “We were even blamed for their failures in Afghanistan... we were not sure whether America was our ally or our enemy,” he said.Laden was killed in a military operation by US Navy Seals in 2011 in Abbottabad.Slamming Khan’s speech, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari of PPP said, “I can only compare this to how the state of Pakistan sent soldiers to fight in Kargil. They sent them to their deaths and we did not even acknowledge them.” Khawaja Asif of the opposition PML-N said Khan’s speech was “riddled with errors on history and politics”. He said Osama“brought terrorism to my country. He destroyed my country and Imran Khan has declared him a shaheed”.Asif said, “Zia ul Haq brought Osama to Pakistan and Imran Khan has called him a shaheed.”The row came as Islamabad rejected the US state department’s annual report on terrorism as “self-contradictory” and “selective” in its characterisation of Pakistan’s efforts to counter terrorism and terror financing.The US report has accused Pakistan of continuing to be a “safe haven” for terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad.Pakistan International Airlines said on Thursday it has grounded almost a third of its pilots for holding fake or dubious licences, a month after one of its planes crashed into houses killing 97 people. The move came after the government released a preliminary report into the May 22 crash in Karachi.

In the United States, it could be priced up to $5,080 per course, while Indian generic drugmakers will sell the treatment between 5,000 rupees to 6,000 rupees ($66.13-$79.35).The EMA endorsement, which comes just weeks after a speedy review, means physicians can prescribe the Gilead drug, to be branded Veklury, in Europe once approved by the European Commission, which usually follows CHMP recommendations.Also reads | India’s Hetero prices generic remdesivir for Covid-19 treatment at Rs5,400 per vialThe EU’s conditional marketing authorisation allows a treatment to be sold for a year in the 27-nation trading bloc before all necessary data on its efficacy and side-effects are available. Gilead has to submit final data by December.Demand for the drug soared after it became a front-runner following promise in trials. Gilead expects supply of remdesivir to exceed two million courses by year-end, double its previous target, and is planning to begin testing of an easier-to-use inhaled version of the drug, given intravenously as of now. Remdesivir has already been approved for emergency use in severely-ill patients in the United States, India and South Korea, and has received full approval in Japan.($1 = 75.6105 Indian rupees)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-regulator-recommends-remdesivir-for-covid-19-treatment/story-r0rQr687STv1xcTvDGd3UK.html
26-06-2020||India||Army chief briefs Rajnath on LAC, proposed disengagement||New Delhi: Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Friday briefed defence minister Rajnath Singh on the latest developments along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the immediate requirements of the army if the India-China border standoff is long-drawn, and the proposed disengagement process to cool tensions at the LAC, people familiar with the matter said who spoke on the condition of anonymity.In the hour-long meeting at Singh’s residence, the army chief, who returned on Thursday from his two-day visit to eastern Ladakh, apprised the minister of the critical purchases that the army needs to make in case the border standoff carries on for a longer duration, said of the persons cited above. Singh also returned on Thursday night from a four-day visit to Moscow, where he discussed the time delivery of military equipment including the S-400 air defence missile system from Russia.The army chief briefed the minister on Indian Army positions in eastern Ladakh and how the force was prepared to deal with any eventuality, said the second official. “The army chief’s briefing to the defence minister would have addressed issues of operational readiness at the LAC, additional inductions of troops, and acquisitions that would require extraordinary or fast track processes to make up critical systems and related aspects,” said former army vice chief Lieutenant General AS Lamba (retd).This will enable a comprehensive approach for handling any long haul situation before de-escalation, or lesser contingencies for which the Indian Army is always prepared, Lamba added.During his visit to Ladakh, top officials briefed Naravane on the army’s preparations and ability to respond to threatening actions by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA).The security review of the Ladakh sector, where tensions rose sharply after 20 Indian and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers were killed in a clash in the Galwan Valley on June 15, saw the chief tour forward army bases at Durbuk and Chushul, interact with commanders on the ground and undertake aerial surveys of the army’s deployments in some sensitive sectors.The sectors where Indian soldiers hold forward positions along the LAC include Depsang, Gogra Post-Hot Springs, Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Chumar, and military negotiations for disengagement in some of these areas are in progress.The army chief briefed the minister at a time China has not halted — and instead ramped up — its military activity along LAC in Galwan Valley, with a concentration of soldiers, military vehicles, earth-moving machinery, and erection of structures, including near the same point where Indian and Chinese troops clashed on June 15.The Chinese buildup in other areas along the LAC including Depsang, Gogra Post-Hot Springs and Pangong Tso, hasn’t thinned either. The army is keeping a strict vigil along the LAC and is fully prepared to respond to any provocation or adventurism by the PLA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-briefs-rajnath-on-lac-proposed-disengagement/story-70XY5NKKiykfQIhjgUsSMK.html

Equally lucky were a few hamlets dotting the landscape.The situation has now suddenly changed. Mirik town, officials said, will remain out of bounds for outsiders for a week starting Friday. The decision was taken after four health workers, including a doctor posted at the Mirik community block health centre tested positive for Covid-19. Aswini Kumar Roy, sub-divisional officer of Mirik, said, “The administration will go door- to-door till July 1 to find out if any social contamination has taken place. Nine people have tested positive so far in this sub-division.”Sauraj Golay, president of the Mirik traders’ association said, “Mirik town and all nine community wards in Mirik municipality area will go under complete lockdown. Vehicles will not be allowed to enter or leave Mirik.” Hamlets around Mirik will also follow the lockdown order. The shutdown in Mirik comes days after traders in Siliguri town in the plains decided to suspend business at Bidhan Market, Hong Kong Market and the local jewellery market. Ten people have died in Siliguri and the number of Covid-19 cases in Siliguri sub-division stood at 395 till Thursday. The Siliguri regulated market, which is the largest regulated market in north Bengal and from where vegetable, fruit and fish are supplied to Darjeeling hills and Sikkim, is closed since two weeks.On Friday, traders decided to shut down the Salugara market near Siliguri for a week after some local people tested positive for Covid-19. Sankar Prasad, secretary of the traders’ body said, “A large number of people from outside have come to Salugara to work as porters in the army. Local people are feeling scared.”The army, which has a base in the region, recruits porters on a temporary basis in Sikkim and Salugara. The number of people applying for the six-month long job has increased exponentially this year because of rising unemployment during the lockdown, local people said.Tashi Lama, president of Salugara traders’ association said, “More than 4000 people have come to Salugara while the army needs only 300 porters. They have no place to stay and are spending their nights outside shops and temples.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-zero-covid-19-cases-till-last-week-hamlets-in-darjeeling-hills-will-now-be-locked-down/story-wnxQd6U1NgfJcl5GZC64oI.html

The move coincides with an intensified US rhetoric against China in the midst of Trump’s re-election campaign, in which opinion polls have shown voters increasingly embittered toward Beijing, especially over the coronavirus that began from China’s Wuhan.“I am announcing visa restrictions on current and former CCP (Communist Party of China) officials who are believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, as guaranteed in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, or undermining human rights and fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong,” Pompeo said in a statement Friday.Pompeo said family members of such persons may also be subject to these restrictions.Also Read: China, the common link between Ladakh and 3 US super carriers in the Indo-PacificFriday’s restrictions come just days after US President Donald Trump signed off on a legislation that cleared the path for imposing sanctions against senior Chinese officials for gross human rights violations of Uyghur minority groups in China’s restive Muslim-majority Xinjiang region.On Twitter, Pompeo counted the visa restrictions as one of the steps to punish CCP officials “responsible for eviscerating Hong Kong’s freedoms” that had been promised by President Trump. President @realDonaldTrump promised to punish the CCP officials responsible for eviscerating Hong Kong’s freedoms. Today, we are taking action to do just that– we've announced visa restrictions on CCP officials responsible for undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy and human rights.President Trump had earlier promised sanctions against Chinese and Hong Kong officials “directly or indirectly involved” in eroding Hong Kong’s autonomy.“Our actions will be strong. Our actions will be meaningful,” Trump said in May.“Today, we are taking action to do just that– we’ve announced visa restrictions on CCP officials responsible for undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy and human rights,” Pompeo tweeted on Friday.News agency Bloomberg said Friday’s move comes amid worsening ties between the world’s two biggest economies. Despite meetings that Pompeo held with his Chinese counterpart in Hawaii last week, relations remain soured over issues from China’s handling of the coronavirus to its move to enact legislation restricting Hong Kong and its treatment of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang province.Just two days back, the Pentagon published a list of 20 Chinese companies said to be owned or controlled by China’s military, potentially exposing them to further scrutiny or sanctions in the US.Also Read: Chinese ambassador in United States secretly recruited scientists, says FBIOn Thursday, the Senate approved a bipartisan measure that penalises banks doing business with Chinese officials involved in the national security law the country is seeking to impose on Hong Kong.The hard push comes in response to moves by China to impose a new national security legislation that would undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy and put pressure on local officials to jail pro-democracy activists and bar them from contesting elections.Last month, US President Trump initiated the process to eliminate special economic treatment that allowed Hong Kong to remain a global financial center.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-tightens-the-screws-on-beijing-restricts-visas-for-chinese-officials/story-f0KO5Naw0PIQ1jXATibxaN.html

He attributed the rise and drop in death figures due to ongoing reconciliation of casualties from past weeks.“We are not hiding any deaths. Sometimes, more death cases are reported on a particular day. It happens due to reconciliation of past deaths. There is no question of hiding death cases,” Tope told reporters in Pune on Friday.Tope was responding to questions by reporters following allegations levelled by the leader of opposition in the state assembly, Devendra Fadnavis, who had yesterday written to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray alleging Covid-19 deaths in Mumbai had been under reported by a 1,000.Sharpest single day spike of over 5k Covid cases takes Maharashtra past 1.5 lakh mark“As per my information, the death of 1,000 people caused due to Covid-19 in the last three months has not been reported so far. Any death happening due to Covid-19 should be reported within 72 hours. But it is not happening,” Fadnavis had alleged. He had made similar allegations in the past following which the death toll in Mahrashtra saw a major revision on June 16.1,328 additional fatalities apart from the daily death count was added to the state’s tally that day after a reconciliation of figures done in a review of cases.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesFadnavis has also asked the state to conduct more tests and expressed an apprehension that Pune was not doing enough on testing. Tope rejected the allegation and said that in comparison with Mumbai’s 22,000 tests per million population, 15,000 tests per million of the population was being conducted in Pune. Tope said the number of cases in the state was high because of the higher number of tests being carried out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bmc-sets-deadline-for-reporting-covid-19-deaths-backlog-amid-fadnavis-charge-of-hiding-mumbai-deaths/story-fsOkQyrDNt4zDbssZ5xDCO.html
26-06-2020||India||Covid-19 management may fetch political dividends in Kerala for CPI(M)||Keeping an eye on next year’s assembly elections, the CPI (M)-led Kerala government has started marketing its Covid-19 “success story” as Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan began an online debate lining up many experts to talk about the issue. The opposition, however, quickly dubbed it as another publicity stunt. Citing the CM’s rising stock the party has given a call to its workers that there will be a continuation of power in the state changing the four-decade-old system of gifting power to the Opposition after every five years. The party feels the management of the pandemic and the state’s record of lowest mortality, high recovery and least number of cases will fetch it rich political dividends. Its mortality rate is less than one per cent and recovery about 60 per cent.The party is planning a big campaign citing these records to ensure a second term for Vijayan, said party insiders adding he has turned the crisis into an opportunity with his administrative skills. They say his 6 pm daily press briefing is a big hit but his critics say people view them religiously just to know the daily number of cases and recoveries.“There will be a continuation of power. The state has never seen such able administration. The opposition Congress is quite worried about our popularity that is why it is raising unnecessary allegations. The whole world is praising Kerala but the opposition is trying to sabotage these records,” said CPI (M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan.Titled ‘Kerala Dialogue’ the debate, almost on the lines of Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s interaction with party leaders and workers, will discuss ways to ensure sustainable and inclusive development in the time of the pandemic. Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, political activist Noam Chomsky, World Health Organization scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan and others participated in the debate inaugurated by the CM. The debate will continue on the CM’s social media site in the coming days. Experts will discuss fresh challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and how things will shape up after the threat subsides. The government is of the view that the series can throw enough light on the state’s fight against the contagion and discuss post-pandemic challenges.“The state’s virus management is appreciated all over the world. Like Vietnam and South Korea, it fought a valiant battle to limit the damage. The state always gave importance to social and decentralized development and the results are there to see. We saw how some of the super powers struggled to contain it,” said Amartya Sen. Swaminathan said countries and states which followed the WHO warning and directives were successful in containing the spread.But the opposition is not amused. “This is another publicity stunt. Public relations agencies have a good market in Kerala these days,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. “In terms of tests the state is placed at 23rd. The government is celebrating as if it has won the war,” said BJP state president K Sudhakaran. Kerala reported 150 new Covid-19 cases on Friday. For the last eight days, the state has been reporting more than 100 coronavirus cases a day. Out of 3,876 cases, 1846 are active ones and 2,006 patients have recovered. The first state to report the virus in the country-- a China-returned medical student in January-- Kerala has reported 23 deaths so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-management-may-fetch-political-dividends-in-kerala-for-cpi-m/story-sHiOKzrcWuSM9eCnmOQrJK.html
26-06-2020||India||Amartya Sen, Noam Chomsky praise Kerala fight against Covid-19||Praising Kerala for the way it has handled the coronavirus surge, Nobel-laureate and economist Amartya Sen said on Friday Covid-19 would be a transformatory movement in the state and it has dealt with the pandemic combating bureaucracy and red tape. Sen was speaking during a webinar on development titled ‘Kerala Dialogue’, organised by the Kerala government, to bring together thinkers, policy-makers, professionals, scientists and the public to a space where they could rethink and reimagine development for a world disrupted by the pandemic.Sen came down heavily on the “unplanned and unstructured lockdown” in India and said it caused distress and hardship.“I think Covid would be a transformatory movement in Kerala.There is a danger of being deluged under the rather deceptive economic slogan that is so dominant in India today and there is widespread resistance to that. But it also suggests that combating bureaucracy, combating red tape, and doing things with exceeding speed, which indeed is what Kerala seems to have done in dealing with Covid,” Sen said. Well-known philosopher and social critic, Noam Chomsky, who also participated in the talk, said the way Kerala responded to the Covid-19 pestilence was a surprise to the whole world. “The differences in the way between Kerala and the rest of India, and the rest of most of the world, on how they reacted to the crisis was quite startling.Not many places have dealt with it the way Kerala has. This pandemic has brought out very sharply the extraordinary inequality that has been, of course always there, but greatly exaggerated through the neo-liberal period,” Chomsky said. Asked if there will be a fundamental change in the world at the end of the pandemic, Chomsky claimed countries like the US are trying to continue the current situation and move to more dictatorships, restrictions and people-watching. “But there are movements all over the world to counter this.Coordinating this can be a huge force. They can make changesand theyare all trying to create a new world,” Chomsky said. Sen appreciated the public healthcare system and the high level of literacy in the state. “The unplanned and unstructured lockdown in India caused distress and hardship. The government should have discussed the matter with civil society. However, the government implemented the lockdown in an authoritarian manner.It was a disaster for the daily wage labourers,” Sen said.Sen also pointed out that the collapse of the public system, which has happened in Europe, has not happened in Kerala.“Though Europe had a tradition of public sector intervention it is not there now but that kind of reliance on the public sector can still be seen in Kerala,”he added. WHO Chief Scientist, Dr Soumya Swaminathan said countries, which responded to the early warning issued by the World Health Organization, were better prepared to face the pandemic. “On January 30, WHO issued an emergency alert for global Covid-19 defence.But Kerala had already started preventive measures in early January, anticipating potential problems. That is why the first cases from Wuhan could be discovered.Following this, Kerala was able to locate, quarantine those who had contact with them and contain the outbreak. Kerala has been able to contain the disease as fast as possible due to proper preventive measures,” Swaminathan said. Chomsky said Vietnam has confronted this pestilence and not a single Covid related death was reported there. He also pointed out that South Korea has also effectively controlled the pandemic without even a lockdown. “Taiwan, Hong Kong and New Zealand are other countries that dealt with the disease. In Europe, Germany was able to prevent the spread of the disease in a good way.What saved them was that Germany did not adopt a commercial hospital system like the US,” he said. Chomsky said it was doctors from “poor Cuba, who have been the victims of the US economic assault for more than six decades”, who moved to Italy to help them out. “This pandemic was able to show the extraordinary inequality of the world. In the United States, it was most pronounced....Blacks and their descendants from Spain and South America suffered the most in the United States,” he claimed. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan,who also participated in the discussion, said Kerala was starting a new conversation on development. “The Left Front is launching the KeralaDialogue to bring new concepts and sustainable development models,” Vijayan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amartya-sen-noam-chomsky-praise-kerala-fight-against-covid-19/story-eWLFUs5nldBiJUranNGUVM.html

Reiterating India’s position that the standoff and a violent face-off on June 15 were triggered by China’s actions, Vikram Misri told news agency PTI in Beijing that the Chinese side has to stop the practice of transgressing. His remarks made it clear that the Indian side expects China to take steps that will lead to de-escalation and disengagement on the LAC and help restore peace and tranquillity along the disputed border.The comments also appeared to be a riposte to remarks by China’s envoy to India, Sun Weidong, who had said in an interview on Thursday that the onus wasn’t on his country to resolve the border standoff.

The statement also acknowledged both sides “remain deployed in large numbers in the region”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/must-stop-practice-of-transgressions-india-draws-red-lines-for-china-along-lac/story-Jt84ibmfscqFSOSj94aKtN.html
26-06-2020||India||Govt allows more flights on domestic routes, extends bar on international routes||The ministry of civil aviation has given its nod to increase capacity of domestic flight operations to 45% from 33% allowed at present.An order issued by the ministry on Friday noted that the director general of civil aviation (DGCA) has been requested to prepare the schedule of airlines. HT has reviewed a copy of the order.“We are working on the schedule specific to different airports in the country and soon we should be able to provide more connectivity to our citizens,” a senior DGCA official said.The order has revised the Centre’s earlier order issued on May 21 restricting capacity utilisation of domestic flights to a third of the approved summer schedule.“In partial modification on the order issued on May 21, after review of the current status of scheduled domestic operations viz-viz passenger demand for air travel…one third capacity may be read as 45%,” the order noted.Domestic flights were allowed to resume from May 25, two months after a blanket suspension since the first lockdown was announced while only international repatriation flights and cargo flights have been allowed by the government.The Centre has also extended the suspension on international flights to July 15 from June 30.“The decision has been taken to gradually increase more flights and add more routes in a calibrated manner. We expect the capacity to increase slowly with demand. We are looking to increase our domestic passengers from 60,000 to 70,000,” a civil aviation ministry official said. On June 25, a month since the resumption of domestic flights, 772 flights took off ferrying 62,580 passengers, according to the aviation ministry.This also comes a week after union civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri said that he was hopeful of resuming domestic flights to full capacity by year end, adding that a decision on international flights may be taken when domestic air traffic reaches 50-55 % of its pre-Covid capacity.The limits on airfares imposed on domestic flights may also be extended beyond the current period of August 24, officials said. The Centre had imposed a cap on the airfares of domestic flights that resumed from May 25 with fixed lower and upper limits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-increases-capacity-of-domestic-flight-ops-to-45-from-33-at-present-dgca-asked-to-chart-new-routes-with-airlines/story-YjVSqGjobArkSDXsp3CyrL.html

26-06-2020||India||I unlocked a script, locked in my mind for years: Deepraj Rana||Actor Deepraj Rana made good use of the quarantine phase and finished scripting two stories that he was unable to do in all these years. The UPite completed the scripts one for a film and the other for OTT platform — both set in his hometown Prayagraj.“The phase turned out to be very productive and fulfilling for me. I was trying to write a story of Gulab Devi, a first female who performed last-rites in Prayagraj way back in 1925. Many a times, I wrote in bits and pieces but I was never satisfied. But this time I was able to complete the entire script along with the screenplay and dialogues,” said Deepraj over the phone. His last few projects being ‘Prasthanam’, ‘Dabangg3’ and TV show ‘Muskan,’ Deepraj has always find full support and a critic in his wife Natasha Rana who also happens to be an actor.Talking more about his script based on Gulab Devi, he said, “Known as Maharajin Sarkaar, she got in this profession at the age of 13 at Daraganj Ghat. Making her way in the male baston, she worked there till she was 25 years old. Later, she shifted to Rusoolabagh cremation ghat. Such was her ‘aura’ that people used to make a wish to get cremated by her. My home is nearby in Shivkuti area so I have seen it all very closely.” “Besides, there are multiple layers to the story like ghat politics is one aspect then characters of mallah (boatman), ‘aughar’, tantrik, pandas and among them a sole woman working in the male domain. It was a big thing! There have been many extraordinary situations in her life that I have woven in the story,” he further said.Deepraj feels that a strong female lead is required to do justice to the role and a theatrical release is best suited for the story. He has shared both his scripts with friends to get their feedback and then will pitch it to filmmakers.“I believe theatres will not open any time soon as Covid-19 cases are on a rise. So, this is the best time to devote in pre-production so the shoot can start next year and God-willing by that time we will have a vaccine too,” he said.The versatile actor has also written a youth-centric web-series in this duration which is again set in his hometown and is spread over two seasons.“Every since the lockdown started I tried to utilise it in the best possible way. I enrolled myself in a chakra meditation course and did three levels of it. Besides, with the help of online videos I cooked a lot of dishes.”Next, he is looking forward to shoot for ‘Mard’ starring Randeep Hooda. “Rahul Mittra has announced the film which Sai Kabir will be directing. It is scheduled to be shot in and around Lucknow. When we will get a green signal I will be available for the shoot. It’s a tough time and as per the government, self-precaution is the key and we will have to abide by all the safety norms.” Deepraj has shot for films like ‘Prasthanam’, ‘Bullett Raja’, ‘DaasDev’ and ‘Milan Talkies’ in Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-unlocked-a-script-locked-in-my-mind-for-years-deepraj-rana/story-kzUTKRHdYwsGFI9Nw9EUBN.html

Bangalore accounted for 144 of the 445 new cases and nearly a third of all active cases are in the state capital.Some of the key opposition leaders including former CM and JDS leader H D Kumaraswamy have demanded that Bangalore be locked down for ‘at least 20 days’ arguing that ‘economy was not more important than lives’. However, the government made it clear that while select areas may be sealed; there was no question of either a citywide or a statewide lockdown being implemented.At the meeting with Bangalore’s elected representatives, the government outlined its plan of action with the CM saying that everybody’s cooperation was required to face the pandemic and it was not the time to score political brownie points. The government said that a throat swab testing facility will be set up at every one of the 28 assembly constituencies in Bangalore.The state government also promised a separate ambulance facility to transport the bodies of Covid-19 victims. The government would also commandeer large marriage halls, hotels and other large spaces to quarantine asymptomatic patients. A nodal officer for each assembly constituency would monitor the handling of the Covid-19 situation.The state government also said that ayurvedic medicines would be distributed to increase immunity levels as a precautionary measure but it wasn’t clear how and where it would be done. Meanwhile a 60-year-old woman who had tested positive for Covid-19 along with other family members and was being treated at the government-run KC General Hospital killed herself by hanging in the bathroom in the early hours of Friday.She was said to have been mentally depressed due to the entire family including her son, daughter-in-law and grandson testing Covid-19 positive. Authorities have registered a case and are investigating.Also for the first time in more than a century the Chamundi hill temple in Mysore was deserted on the first Friday of the Hindu month of Ashada when every year normally lakhs throng to get a darshan. Authorities had allowed only priests and temple officials to perform the necessary rituals. According to a temple priest, the last time such a drastic step had been taken was during the 1918 plague when visitors were temporarily barred.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/economy-equally-important-no-further-lockdown-says-karnataka-cm-yediyurappa/story-Idqu5ZFchAG4ybkkNaqNwI.html

26-06-2020||India||Memorial, 5 statues as Telangana celebrates Narasimha Rao’s birth centenary||The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government is all set to kick off year-long birth centenary celebrations of former Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao starting Sunday. The arrangements are in full swing at Gyan Bhoomi - the samadhi of Narasimha Rao at Necklace Road in Hyderabad on the banks of Hussainsagar lake - for the centenary celebrations.An official release from the chief minister’s office said the state government had earmarked Rs 10 crore for celebrations throughout the year. A committee, headed by Rajya Sabha member K Kesava Rao, had been constituted to conduct various programmes all through the year.The official release said a memorial for Roa would be set up in Hyderabad on the lines of former President APJ Abdul Kalam’s memorial in Rameshwaram in Tamil Nadu. Five bronze statues of PV would be installed at Hyderabad, Warangal, Karimnagar, Vangara (the birthplace of Rao) and Telangana Bhavan in Delhi. “A portrait of PV should be kept in the Telangana state legislative Assembly,” the chief minister said.He also announced a resolution would be adopted in the state assembly in its next session, recommending to the Centre to award Bharat Ratna to Narasimha Rao on the occasion of his birth centenary.However, the state government’s decision to celebrate Rao through the year has angered a section of Muslim groups in the state.Jamaat-e-Islami Telangana unit spokesman Hamid Mohammad Khan said the TRS government had hurt the sentiments of the Muslim community by deciding to celebrate Rao’s birth centenary throughout the year. “It is a known fact that Narasimha Rao was responsible for the demolition of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya. He deliberately remained silent when the mosque was being razed. The Muslims of this country would never forget this historic mistake committed by him,” Khan told Hindustan Times.The JeI spokesman alleged that the government wanted to exploit the Telangana sentiment and gain political mileage as the former PM hailed from the region.Though they have no immediate plans to stage any protest rallies in the wake of prevailing Covid-19 pandemic, Khan said his organisation would write a letter to the chief minister conveying the sentiments of the Muslim community.Majlis Bachao Tehreek (MBT) president Amjad Ullah Khan said by deciding to celebrate PV birth centenary celebrations, the TRS chief had shown his true colours and scant respect for the Muslims.“Why did KCR own up a person like Narasimha Rao who had been disowned by his own party - the Congress. Why did he ignore the birth centenary celebrations of former chief minister Dr Marri Channa Reddy, who had played a key role in the first Telangana movement in 1969?” he asked.The MBT leader alleged that KCR wanted to be in the good books of RSS which hold the former Prime Minister in high regard. Interestingly, Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi, who had fought a battle for Babri Masjid in the last two decades, has not yet come out with any statement protesting the TRS government’s decision. Efforts to reach out to Owaisi seeking his reaction proved futile and he did not respond to the text messages either.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/memorial-5-statues-as-telangana-celebrates-narasimha-rao-s-birth-centenary/story-qKgIugD1vGPgCbd7cC65iL.html

Modi, who launched the “Atma nirbhar Uttar Pradesh Rozgar Abhiyan” seeking to promote local entrepreneurship with industrial associations to provide employment, said Adityanath managed to turn the epidemic into an opportunity which the governments prior to 2017 would have avoided. The prime minister referred to the pre-2017 period when the state was mostly ruled by non-BJP governments, saying, “Whichever government or system was in place, the circumstances were such that they would have avoided the challenge but the Adityanath government took it seriously and worked on a war footing.” He referred to a stampede in Allahabad during the Kumbh Mela, when a former prime minister was in power who was also an MP from the city, saying the PM made all efforts to brush the “deaths of hundreds of thousands” pilgrims under the carpet.  Modi said UP’s population of 24 crore is same as that of four European countries put together but, in UP the death toll is 600 due to coronavirus and lauded the efforts of Adityanath in tackling the pandemic. “UP’s achievement is massive... The population of 24 crore is bigger than that of many countries. The population of England, France, Italy and Spain put together comes to 24 crore but they saw 1.30 lakh deaths due to coronavirus,” he said, adding that these four countries lost more lives than UP even though they are developed nations and have no dearth of facilities. Referring to the scenario in United States, he said, “You must have seen reports of America. They have everything but even then 1.25 lakh lives have been lost till now.” “If Yogiji and his team had not made proper preparations, today 85,000 people would have lost their lives if we compare with other countries. We can say that the hard work done by the UP government saved so many lives,” he said. Modi, who interacted with villagers of six districts through common services centres and krishi vigyan kendras , said this achievement has been managed when 30 to 35 lakh labourers have returned to the state by hundreds of shramik trains. Speaking about the works done by the Adityanath government, he said the chief minister’s dedication was evident in the fact that he opted to miss his father’s last rites. Modi said that he always talked about the double engine for development which was working for Uttar Pradesh and hoped that other states would also bring in schemes like UP. He stressed that he is concerned about the state as a citizen and also because he is an MP from here. “Whoever shows courage in crisis gets success. What you have done is an example for the world,” he said, adding that Uttar Pradesh has a great role in making the country self-reliant. He also hailed the work done by the UP government in the past three years and reminded that the fight against coronavirus was on and cited three steps of social distancing, covering face with a mask and sanitation. The “Atma nirbhar Uttar Pradesh Rozgar Abhiyan” scheme aims to generate 1.25 crore jobs in 31 districts. Exuding confidence of providing jobs to all migrant workers of Uttar Pradesh, Adityanath said the state has enough potential to create employment opportunities for all of them. “Uttar Pradesh has enough possibilities for creating employment for migrant workers who have returned to the state. I can assure that we will succeed in employing all of them,” said Adityanath while launching the scheme through video conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-praises-adityanath-for-his-handling-of-coronavirus-says-it-helped-save-85k-lives/story-uqlpdWNWeJh1yLvzjh2uYL.html

26-06-2020||India||Mamata writes to PM Modi, says 100% FDI in coal sector contradicts spirit of self-reliance||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has opposed 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in the coal sector, saying it contradicts the spirit of self reliance and comes at a time when investors across the world are showing interest in renewable energy.On Thursday, Banerjee expressed her reservations in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. She also said that Coal India Limited should not shift the desk offices of four of its subsidiary companies from Kolkata to their headquarters in other regions.Referring to the new policy announced by the Centre on allowing 100 % FDI in coal mining, processing and sale, Banerjee wrote: “This policy can neither bring FDI nor can it bring technologies or knowhow which we are unable to access today. The recent trend and empirical evidences clearly showcase the interest of global investors more in renewable energy projects as comparable to coal mining projects. In fact research suggests about 100 global financial institutions have divested their thermal coal investments. Therefore FDI in thermal coal is a far cry.”ALSO READ | Cut money tag returns in garb of nepotism for TMC in Bengal’s Amphan-hit districtsThe decision on allowing 100 per cent FDI in coal sector was taken by the Centre in 2019. “At a time when the world’s largest coal mining company Coal India Limited (CIL) is producing 80% of our coal with Profit Before Tax of Rs 27,000 crore (2018-19) and holding a reserve of Rs 31,000 crore the decision of the Central government to relax FDI restrictions demeans the capability of CIL,” wrote Banerjee.“Moreover allowing 100% FDI in coal for MNCs will carry a wrong message as it would contradict the very essence of Atmanirbhar Bharat and would also kill the vision of self-reliant policy that we have been following since the beginning,” the letter says. “Further it is observed that in many under-developed and developed countries there has been continuous resistance by the locals against any effort of their possible exploitation. As a result it would create a great impact on the domestic economy in the long run,” observed Banerjee.“As regards possibility of multinational corporations bringing appropriate new technologies in the thermal coal sector it may be mentioned that relevant technologies are universally available in this sector and our companies are already using them widely,” she said.“The recent abrupt decision to shift the desk offices of four of its subsidiary companies namely Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL), Central Coalfields Limited (CCL), South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL) and Mahanadi Coalfields Limited (MCL) from Kolkata to their respective headquarters in other areas will be extremely detrimental to the interest of all stakeholders of coal sector including the employees,” the letter said.Referring to the restriction of movement because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Banerjee said the decision of CIL “to shift these offices by June 30 is not humane and may endanger the innocent lives of its large number of employees as well as their family members.”“The contractual employees residing in or near Kolkata will lose their livelihood,” she added. “The location of the offices of all the four subsidiaries in the same city acts as an aid in better coordination among them and even with the CIL headquarters in Kolkata. The decision to shift them from the present strategic centre and commercial hub to other areas will have an adverse effect on our economy,” the letter said.“I would therefore request you to kindly reconsider allowing 100% FDI in coal sector and strongly urge your kind intervention or advising the Ministry of Coal not to go ahead with the decision of CIL to wind up their subordinate offices in Kolkata,” the letter said.The Bharatiya Janata Party reacted sharply to Banerjee’s letter and said shifting the desk offices of the four CIL subsidiaries is necessary to save them from bad work culture. “The FDI in coal sector will benefit West Bengal and the state government the most. But work culture in the state has touched the bottom of the pit. All offices have become centres of politics. Nobody works here. As a result, the Centre has decided to shift some of the offices from Kolkata. The decision was taken long ago but local parties moved the Centre and stalled it. There has been no change in work culture since then. As a result, the coal companies are falling sick,” said BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha. “The CM is free to write letters but instead of that she should take an interest in reviving the work culture in Bengal. Had she done this then not just BCCL but many private companies would have stayed here instead of shifting to other states. The trend started during the Left regime and TMC is taking it to its finale,” said Sinha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-writes-to-pm-modi-says-100-fdi-in-coal-sector-contradicts-spirit-of-self-reliance/story-WGlPRak1JeDUGaKB2AZKLM.html

The militants, believed to be locals, were hiding in a house which was damaged during the gun battle. Two AK-47 assault rifles were recovered from the site, a spokesperson of the Indian Army said.A police spokesman said that, during a search operation, the militants were given an opportunity to surrender. However, they fired indiscriminately on the joint search party, which retaliated and this led to the gun battle. “Arms and ammunition, including two AK rifles, six AK magazines, five AK rounds, a pistol, a pistol magazine, four pistol rounds and other incriminating materials were recovered from the site. All the recovered materials have been taken into case records for further investigation and to probe their role and complicity in other terror crimes,” the spokesman said.The spokesman further said that the bodies of the three militants have been sent to Handwara for conducting the last rites after completing medico-legal formalities, including collection of DNA. “In case any family claims the killed terrorists as their kin, they can come forward for their identification and participation in the last rites at Handwara,” he said. Security forces have stepped up the offensive in Kashmir Valley and killed more than 100 terrorists in operations since the beginning of this year.

26-06-2020||India||International commercial flights to remain suspended till July 15: Government||Commercial international flights to and from India will continue to remain suspended till July 15, according to a government release issued on Friday.A circular released by the Director General of Civil Aviation in New Delhi said that “scheduled International commercial passenger services to/from India shall remain suspended till 23:59 hours IST of 15th July,2020.”It specified that this restriction will not apply to international cargo operations and flights specifically approved by the aviation regulator.The official release goes on to say that some international scheduled flights on “selected routes” may be allowed by the competent authorities on a case to case basis.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe government is currently running the third phase of Vande Bharat Mission- one of the largest citizen repatriation programmes undertaken by any government to evacuate people stranded in different countries after suspension of international commercial airline operations due to coronavirus pandemic outbreak.The regular international commercial flight operation was suspended on March 22 by the Indian government immediately before the imposition of the first phase of complete lockdown to fight the spread of coronavirus disease.On June 20, the civil aviation minister had said that the resumption of international flights depended on other countries being open to receiving flights. However, he had expressed hope that the domestic flights will be restored to their full capacity by the year end.Explaining the problem, the minister had explained that many countries had put conditions on entry of people in their jurisdictions including restrictions on entry of foreign nationals and this had left India with little option but to keep the flights suspended.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19He gave examples of the US, the UK, France, China, UAE and Singapore to state his point.India has managed to move a total of 182,313 passengers till June 24, 2020 under the Vande Bharat Mission, which began on June 11, according to the latest data released by the ministry on Thursday. Air India group has operated a total of 1,414 flights till yesterday.The government is also looking to explore the possibility of establishing bilateral arrangements with countries to allow their carriers to operate flights from India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-commercial-flights-to-remain-suspended-till-july-15-government/story-lpDWjOuVn7hYePa53NXqoL.html
26-06-2020||India||The virus has made India’s devastating gender gap even worse||Women around the world have been hurt financially by the coronavirus outbreak, but the situation in India is more precarious for them than almost anywhere else. For women in India already suffer from a wide gender gap in employment, wages and education.Less than a quarter of women in India are in the labor force — among the poorest standings in the world — and they earn 35% less on average than men, compared to the global average of a 16% gap. Women represent 49% of India’s population yet contribute only 18% to its economic output, about half the global average. And when Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 25 imposed a lockdown on this nation of 1.3 billion people, many women were set back even further.Asha Sharma, 25, is among them. Five years ago, she left the hilly state of Uttarakhand for New Delhi to try to make a living from her passion of dancing to Bollywood songs. That dream lasted only a short while; she couldn’t get into a dance troupe and her degree from a small town was of no help in landing an office job in the city. With a friend’s reference, Sharma found a job at a beauty salon.She was earning about 12,000 rupees ($159) a month and sending some money back home to her mother, a worker at a government child-care center. After her father’s death a decade ago, her mother struggled to raise three children. Sharma can no longer help, though, as she has had no income in the past two months with the beauty salon shuttered.Her siblings are also out of work amid the outbreak, making them all dependent again on the 1,500 rupees a month their mother earns.“Our mother did so much for us. Now we are all grown up but can’t do anything to help her,” Sharma said. “It’s not easy for a woman to earn. Unlike men, who can do any kind of job, we have limitations. We also have to keep safety aspects in mind.”The virus outbreak and stay-at-home orders in India have hurt women in other ways. Many of the millions of migrant workers forced to flee cities for their rural homes with little notice were women. They are over-represented in vulnerable service jobs like health care and education and in informal jobs, such as agriculture and sex work, where there’s no safety net. And as Sharma points out, they have safety concerns, with travel a risk for many.“Lockdown and social-distancing norms are likely to have an outsized impact on women. The concern is the economic impact will be felt across employment and well-being indicators over the coming years,” said Sanjay Mathur, an economist with Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, calling this “India’s painful shecession.” That’s a term used by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research after U.S. employment numbers showed a majority of jobs lost in April were held by women.Oxfam India estimates the economic loss from women losing their jobs during the pandemic at about $216 billion, knocking off 8% from the country’s gross domestic product. This clouds women’s already poor economic outlook. The World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index 2020 ranks India 112th of 153 countries in offering equal opportunities to women and men, and women often don’t have the same access to health care and education as their male counterparts.Even professional women in India have had setbacks. The virus outbreak has led many to work from home, yet Poonam Kumar made that choice 20 years ago. A freelance public relations professional living on the outskirts of New Delhi, Kumar wanted to spend time with family, raising her son, who’s now 16.“People who started with me have grown big,” she said over the phone from her residence in Gurugram, referring to colleagues from early in her career who have moved up the ladder. “But that was a choice I made.”Kumar said her life was going smoothly, until the pandemic hit. Her husband’s retail business was hurt by the lockdown, and Kumar’s business, she says, “is at a standstill.” She has lost four of her six clients and hasn’t been able to pay full salaries to the two women she employs.“When companies are struggling to pay salaries and chucking out employees, no one is going to think about public relations,” she said. “I don’t see things returning to normal anytime soon. I’m trying to figure out what to do next.”Other InequitiesThe impact of the virus is also exacerbating India’s deep-rooted social inequities. An unsafe environment in many places, with a girl raped an average of every 15 minutes, and the burden of domestic responsibilities have kept many women away from work. There has been a more than two-fold rise in complaints of domestic violence since the lockdown. Experts warn that girls’ education will be disadvantaged — as only 29% of Internet users in India are female, and there’s a tendency for families with limited means to give preference to boys for schooling.“Insofar that violence has long-lasting emotional and psychological consequences, one persistent economic impact will be on women’s ability to work outside their homes,” said Tarun Jain, a professor of economics at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad.Female employment in April was at 61% of the pre-lockdown yearly average; for men it was 71%, Ashwini Deshpande, an economics professor at Ashoka University, wrote in a research paper June 3. Women employed in the pre-lockdown phase were 23.5 percentage points less likely than men to be employed post-lockdown, she said.Neeti Pandey, 42, last month became part of those statistics when she walked out of the private school where she taught for about two years, holding a termination letter. A mathematics teacher in Indirapuram near New Delhi, Pandey was called to the school and asked to resign along with several other teachers. They were told there was no money to pay them as many families had stopped paying tuition.The news came as a shock to Pandey, a mother of two who had become the family’s lone breadwinner after her husband, a cancer patient, gave up his grocery business last year. She wasn’t paid for April and May though she taught online classes from home. Taking care of her husband, along with child care and elderly care, has added to her burden.“Life is tough for a woman. Men will do only one job at a time, but we always have to do multitasking. We are supposed to strike the right balance between family and work, and keep everyone happy,” she said. “But if you are sad, you can’t hide it for long.”For now, Pandey is managing with a little savings and some financial assistance from relatives. She is desperately looking for a job, but with unemployment rising above 23%, her search hasn’t been easy.Work RisksIn India, women are at higher risk of contracting the virus because they are overrepresented in the health-care sector. Women’s self-help groups are trying to make available personal protective equipment gear, though the need is great.For some women, “the choice seems to be between unemployment and jobs that put them at risk of disease and infection and make them targets of vicious stigma,” Deshpande said.Madhu, 39, who goes by only one name, is used to handling risk in her job. She is a sex worker in New Delhi, saying financial need pushed her into this field more than a decade ago. She was separated from her husband when her two daughters, nearly adults now, were toddlers. She tells her family she’s a peer educator doing awareness training about AIDS — which she is, a job that pays little but lets her keep her real work under wraps.“There was a time we were 12 people at home, including my parents and siblings, and there was hardly any food to eat. We fed sugar syrup to the kids for days,” Madhu said. “It was then a friend told me about the men who pay 100 rupees for a one-hour bike ride with them. That was a princely amount for me at that time.”The lockdown has left Madhu and millions of other sex workers in India without a source of income. There are no social welfare programs specifically for sex workers in India, and many of them don’t have documents that give the poor access to free food and cash transfers.To survive during the outbreak, Madhu started working at a hospital canteen where coronavirus patients are treated. She serves food to doctors and patients, and in return gets leftovers for her family. A few of her clients also have provided some financial help.“I wish I had studied and become a teacher,” she said. “I don’t want my daughters to struggle like me.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-virus-has-made-india-s-devastating-gender-gap-even-worse/story-cvIzpDBN2RUKRvIxtJ7eyI.html

26-06-2020||India||Reuters’ claim of India calling Army to run Covid facilities is ‘far from reality’: Government||The union government has issued a denial to a Reuters news report, carried two days ago on Wednesday, claiming the Centre had called in the Indian Army to run covid-19 treatment and management facilities in Delhi as the number of positive cases were on a rise. The home ministry denial has termed the Reuters report as “far away from reality” and clarified that only medical personnel belonging to the armed forces and the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) have been summoned to assist at some medical facilities in Delhi.“Reuters headline says “India calls in Army to run facilities in Delhi as cases surge”. This news is far away from reality. Note: Army has not been called in, only medical personnel of Armed Forces & CAPF have been asked to assist at some medical facilities in Delhi,” an official statement from the home ministry said on Friday.The Reuters news story published on Wednesday referred to the temporary Covid care treatment centre erected at the Radha Soami Beas premises in south Delhi and the railway coaches converted into Covid wards, to say they were among the facilities designated to be handled by the armed forces.“These include a 10,000 bed facility hosted at a religious centre and railway coaches turned into wards,” the report said.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesIt also quoted home minister Amit Shah to substantiate its misleading headline. ‘“Armed forces personnel have been detailed for providing medical care and attention to Covid-19 patients housed in the railway coaches in Delhi,” Home Minister Amit Shah said,’ said the Reuters story.On Wednesday, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) had taken over the charge of managing the temporary treatment centre created on the premises of Radha Soami Beas establishment in Chhatarpur area in Delhi on the request of the home ministry.ITBP chief visits India’s largest Covid 19 care centre with 10,000 beds, says force will deal with any challengeITBP has deployed around 1,000 of its medical professionals including doctors, nurses and paramedic staff to work at the facility, created to meet the challenges of the rising number of infections in Delhi.“India reported 16,000 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday (Jun 24), its highest daily increase since the outbreak began, and the government called in the army to manage new treatment centres with thousands of additional hospital beds in New Delhi,” said the Reuters story, published as it is by several international media organizations, such as Channel News Asia based in Singapore and The Dawn of Pakistan.This is not the first such assignment handled by ITBP, which also created and ran the Chhawla quarantine centre in the national capital, which was created more than two months ago for Indians evacuated from China and Italy.Indian Army has also been helping the civil administration in Covid containment efforts with its medical facilities and staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reuters-claim-of-india-calling-army-to-run-covid-facilities-is-far-from-reality-government/story-993uzOqHX3Rt7ysUFZhIZJ.html
26-06-2020||India||In 3 video messages, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul and Priyanka amp up attack on PM over ‘Chinese incursion’||In three video messages released back-to-back on Friday afternoon, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, son Rahul and daughter Priyanka stepped up attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the India-China border standoff and asked the government to take people into confidence on the extent of territories being occupied by Chinese troops.Sonia Gandhi recalled PM Modi’s statements that China hasn’t crossed into our territory. But, she said, Chinese forces do appear to have occupied Indian territory according to defence experts, satellite images and statements emerging out of the foreign ministry.The three video messages were prefaced by glowing tributes to the army and 20 soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice at the violent face-off with China’s People’s Liberation Army troopers in east Ladakh’s Galwan area earlier this month. Then came the jabs and swipes.While the country pays tributes to the fallen soldiers, Sonia Gandhi said the central government could not step back from its responsibilities and must get back the Indian territory, which she said, had been occupied by Chinese troops. She also asked the government to back the army all the way. “This is true patriotism,” she said, wrapping up her three-minute video message.The three video messages from the Gandhi family come against the backdrop of stinging attacks on them from the top leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders that alleged the party’s Rajiv Gandhi Foundation was a beneficiary of donations from the Chinese government and its embassy in New Delhi. Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad alleged the donation had led the Congress to support China. He also said RGF had pushed for a free trade agreement between the two countries, leading to a huge trade deficit skewed in favour of China, and that the donation led to the Congress supporting China.Also Read: India has closed military gap with China along borderThis morning, BJP chief JP Nadda put out excerpts from annual reports of Rajiv Gandhi Foundation to allege that the PM Relief Fund, which receives donations from the public, had gone ahead to donate money to the RGF, when the Manmohan Singh-led coalition was in power.Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s video messages were a tad more acerbic than the one from Sonia Gandhi.China has taken away our land not just at one place but in three areas. “Prime Minister ji, you will have to speak the truth and tell the country. There is no need to get flustered. If you say no land was taken away and the truth is otherwise, it will be China’s gain,” Rahul Gandhi said. Nudging PM Modi to come out with a revised statement, Rahul Gandhi said China would be the key beneficiary if India keeps on denying that it has occupied territory when it has.Also Read: US shifting military to face Chinese threat to India and Southeast Asia, says Mike PompeoPriyanka Gandhi sought to link Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to improve relations with China over his information summits with President Xi jinping. “What happened during the discussions that PM Modi had held with the Chinese that they were so emboldened to take over our territories,” Priyanka Gandhi asked, asserting that it was everyone’s duty to ask questions of the government. “We will not allow the sacrifices of our soldiers to go in vain…. It will be a crime to disrespect their sacrifice. We will not allow this to happen,” she said.The Congress insists that PM Modi’s concluding statement at the all-party meeting that Chinese troops were not present in Indian territory contradicted the earlier statements made by the Army chief, the defence Minister and the foreign ministry. The party asked if no Chinese troops had crossed the LAC, what was the reason for the face-off.The Prime Minister’s Office had responded to this line of attack to clarify that the PM’s observations that there was no Chinese presence on our side of the LAC pertain to the situation as a consequence of the bravery of the Armed Forces. “The sacrifice of the soldiers of the 16 Bihar Regiment for the attempts of the Chinese side to erect structures and also cleared the attempted transgression at this point of the LAC on that day,” the PMO had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-india-china-standoff-in-galwan-valley-of-ladakh-sonia-gandhi-rahul-and-priyanka/story-9v2FZq3TJwizCvX50jrbYK.html
26-06-2020||India||Cash-strapped Himachal cuts power subsidy, hikes vehicle tax||The cash-strapped Himachal Pradesh (HP) government has come down hard at consumers by increasing vehicle registration fees and also slashed electricity subsidy to shore up its revenue amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.These decisions were taken during a state cabinet meeting on Thursday.The registration fees for motorcycles have been increased from the existing 2.5%-4% to 7%-10%.The new registration fee for a motorcycle that costs up to Rs 50,000 will be 7%; 8% for above Rs 50,000, and up to Rs 2 lakh; and 10% for above Rs 2 lakh.Similarly, the registration fee for a car has been increased from 8% to 10%.The state government will charge 100% of the composite fee from small contract carriers coming to HP with riders from outside states.The 15-day waiver for contract carriers, who paid the tax for a month at one go, has also been done away with.The state government has decided to slash the Rs 480-crore subsidy for the Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board (HPSEB) by Rs 110 crore in a bid to give relief to those consumers, whose monthly consumption is below 125 units.Government data showed that 18% of the subsidy went to 11 lakh consumers, who consume less than 125 units of electricity per month, and the rest to another nine lakh consumers, whose consumption is over 125 units in a month.There will be no change in the power bills for consumers using electricity less than 125 units a month.However, those who use power between 125 and 200 units a month will see a hike between Rs 40 and Rs 113 in their monthly electricity bills.Similarly, those consuming between 201 to 300 units of power will see an increase between Rs 115 and Rs 200 in their monthly bills. The consumption pattern between Rs 301 and 400 electricity units will entail an increase in the monthly bill between Rs 200 and Rs 290. A consumer has to cough up between Rs 300 and Rs 400 more a month, if his consumption is found to be 401 units or above.In HP, a consumer pays Rs 2.62 for a unit of power, as compared to Rs 6.59 and Rs 3.27 in neighbouring Punjab and Uttarakhand, respectively.The state government has also allowed running of buses with 100% of their capacity, but refused to increase fares.Earlier, private bus operators had demanded that the minimum fare be doubled to Rs 10 from Rs 5 because of 60% occupancy due to social distancing norms owing to the viral outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cash-strapped-himachal-cuts-power-subsidy-hikes-vehicle-tax/story-9zoTsizWVMHo7zcFBau3VO.html

26-06-2020||India||Rise in Covid cases: District Judge orders work from home, judges not to call staff to courts||District Judge of Rohini Courts here has asked all the judicial officers to work from home and not to ask staffers to come to courts in view of rising number of coronavirus cases among staffers and judges recently.District Judge Swarana Kanta Sharma took note of the fact that some judicial officers are asking their staffers to come to court premises and issued a circular in this regard.The circular said that despite the Delhi High Court directions that judicial officers were to work from home, it has been brought to the notice that some of them were regularly coming to the court and also calling their entire staff or most of the staff every day.The directions were passed in a circular issued on June 19 after several court staff and judges, who visited the courts premises, have tested positive for Covid-19 in the past few weeks.It said that in case the judges did not have the technical facility to hear cases through video conferencing, they must inform the District Judge.“Many staff members have been tested positive for Covid-19 contagion and the undersigned had to close one court recently on this account.“Therefore, it is once again made clear that all the judicial officers are to work from their respective residences only and in case they do not have the technical facility to do so, they must first inform the undersigned (District Judge) in this regard,” the circular said.It further stated that only one or two staff members should be called for duty on a particular day.“However, Stenographers (Senior PA/PA) can be given dictation preferably over telephone and he/she can work from their home.As far as Peshi is concerned, Ahlmad/Assistant Ahlmad/Reader may be deputed on rotational basis as per their mutual understanding, be called for limited period,” the circular said.It further noted that some of the courts were not uploading their daily orders on server as per the directions of the High Court.“Hence, all the judicial officers are also requested to ensure uploading of daily orders on the server,” it said.Two court staff posted at the courts complex tested positive for Covid-19 on June 19 and June 22 respectively.While one of the officials had last visited the court premises on June 19 and had come in contact with the personal assistant posted in the judge’s court, the other had last visited the courts premises on June 11, according to circulars issued by District Judges.They have been directed to self-quarantine themselves for 14 days or as per medical advice and guidelines of the Government of India.The Caretaking Branch has been directed to carry out deep cleaning and regular sanitization in the courtroom as well as in the Ahlmad room and the judge’s chamber attached therewith, immediately, it added.In another case, the personal assistant posted the court of Metropolitan Magistrate Mayank Goel had tested positive due to which the courtroom was sealed and sanitised along with the Ahlmad room and the Judge’s chamber.The official had come in close contact with the Judge, other staff members, including the Additional Public Prosecutor and the Constable posted in the court.They were sent to self-isolation for seven days.Earlier, District Judge R P Pandey had also tested positive for Covid-19. His courtroom was also closed and sanitised following this.All the six district courts in the national capital have been working in a restricted way since March due to the coronavirus or Covid-19 pandemic in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rise-in-covid-cases-district-judge-orders-work-from-home-judges-not-to-call-staff-to-courts/story-AIgAxBQXF4fVGi9zcWvV5M.html
26-06-2020||India||Sharp rise in cases forces Assam to impose 14-day lockdown in Kamrup Metro district from June 28 midnight||The Assam government has imposed lockdown restrictions in the Kamrup Metro district, including the state’s biggest city Guwahati, for 14 days beginning 7pm on Sunday because of 677 fresh coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive cases in the past 10 days among patients, who had no recent travel history.The government has also decided to impose a curfew from 7pm to 7am across the state, beginning Friday.Weekend curfew on Saturday and Sunday will be imposed in all urban areas -- except Kamrup Metro -- from Saturday and will continue till further orders by the state government.State health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the “painful” decision was taken, as residents of Guwahati were not following safety protocols and posing health hazards for themselves and others. “People have failed to fulfil their social responsibility and when that happens the government has to step in. We have decided to impose complete lockdown in Guwahati from Sunday 7pm onwards for 14 days till 6pm on July 12,” Sarma told media persons on Friday afternoon.“We didn’t want to go from unlocking to a lockdown mode again, but have to take certain tough but painful decisions. It will be strictly enforced and nothing, except hospitals, pharmacies, and laboratories, will be allowed to operate,” he added.The minister said the move was necessitated following the detection of 677 Covid-19 positive cases in Guwahati, who had no travel history, during a community testing campaign in the city that had started from June 15.“We have tested 10,617 Guwahati residents, who haven’t had any recent travel history, since June 15. Of them, 677 tested Covid-19 positive. On Thursday, of the 276 Covid-19 positive cases reported across the state and 133 were from Guwahati alone,” he said.“In Guwahati, barely 10% of the people are following social distancing and other safety norms. The situation is becoming scary and critical. While we expect Covid-19 positive cases across Assam to dip in the coming days, the surge is likely to continue in Guwahati,” Sarma warned.The minister said that government-run hospitals in Guwahati and the rest of Kamrup Metro district have 890 beds that have been set aside for Covid-19 patients, and if the present trend continues, it would become an uphill task for the health authorities concerned.Sarma said all offices, including government and private firms, would remain closed during the lockdown. All shops and business establishments and industries would also remain shut, private and public vehicles would not be allowed to ply, all hotels, educational institutions, and religious places would close down. Inter-state transport services would also remain shut unless the passengers have prior permission.“No functions of any kind will be allowed and only 20 people can take part in a funeral. No grocery, fruit and vegetable shops and establishments selling meat and poultry products will be allowed to open. I urge the public to buy their essential items before the lockdown starts,” Sarma said.Exemptions include movement of defence and police personnel, government officials involved in essential duties such as fire services, disaster management, electricity, water supply, garbage disposal, health workers, banks (with skeleton staff), automated teller machines (ATMs), milk supply, baby products, medicines, telecommunication, print and electronic media and train and air services.“Only those hotels used for quarantine and by airline crew will be allowed to operate, government directorates and secretariat will function with skeleton staff and petrol pumps allowed to open,” Sarma said.He added that people would be allowed to visit the 31 centres opened in all the wards under Guwahati civic body’s jurisdiction to voluntarily undergo Covid-19 tests.The government is planning to conduct over 50,000 Covid-19 tests in Guwahati by Tuesday.“Assam will be under curfew from 7pm to 7am daily from Friday till further notice. Weekend lockdown on Saturdays and Sundays will be imposed in all urban areas -- except Kamrup Metro --- from this Saturday,” said the minister.“Rural areas in the state will be exempt from weekend lockdown measures. The first seven days of the lockdown in Kamrup Metro will be extremely strict. We will have a review meeting on July 3 and decide if any relaxations can be allowed,” Sarma added.Assam had recorded 6,646 Covid-19 positive cases till Friday noon. The state has recorded 10 deaths to date. While 4,033 Covid-19 patients have recovered from the viral infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharp-rise-in-cases-forces-assam-to-impose-14-day-lockdown-in-kamrup-metro-district-from-june-28-midnight/story-N95badIqJydq8BfokPI1uJ.html

A meeting of around 10,000 people was also held in the three-day programme. A discussion on successor of Rammana, the special secretary of Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC), who died in December 2019 was also held.The programme was held in villages at the border of Sukma and Bijapur districts from June 18-20.Sources said that top Maoist leaders including new general secretary of CPI (Maoist) Nambala Keshav Rao, alias Basavaraju, head of battalion number of 1, Mandavi Hidma, Kosa, Devji and Sujata also attended the meeting.“The information about this three-day meeting has reached me. We are looking into it,” said Director General of Police (DGP), Chhattisgarh, DM Awasthi told Hindustan Times.The senior police officers in Bastar believe that for the first time in last five years such big gathering of civil population has been organised by the Maoists.“Such big gathering was last called by Maoists in Potumpalli village of Sukma in 2015. This year’s gathering was mainly attended by villagers of Sukma, Bijapur and Dantewada districts. Some people of Narayanpur were also present in this gathering,” said a police officer posted in Bastar region.The total population of these three districts is about 5.5 lakh.Another police officer informed that about 300 armed Maoists and more than 500 jan militias (who back the Maoists) were deployed to protect the area for three days. “Sujatha, wife of senior Maoist leader Kishanji was in-charge of security. We don’t have pictures because people were not allowed to carry mobile phones in the gathering,” said the officer.“A woman who attended the gathering told us that the Maoist leaders made stage in the jungle and were giving speeches about the history of Maoism and Bastar. They have also shown the looted weapons and paid tribute to the Maoists who died in recent past. Sports, dance and other cultural activities took place in the gathering,” said a police officer.Experts believe that the Maoists organise these gatherings to show their strength to the people.“I attended one similar meet in Abujhmad in Naryanpur district in 2004 before Salwa Judum in which 10,000 people participated for few days. If they are again doing such meeting after a gap of five years, it is a proof enough that Maoists may be weak but to say that they will be finished soon is day dreaming. People are still with the Maoists in deep jungles in Central India,” said Shubhrashu Chaudhary, Chhattisgarh-based peace activist, who have written extensively on Maoisim.Sources said that the Maoists are supposed to release a video and press release of the gathering in next few days.“Just before the meeting, a senior-level discussion took place over the successor of Maoist leader Ravula Srinivas alias Ramanna (56), who died in December 2019 and was incharge of Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC). A review meeting of tactical counter offensive campaign or TCOC, in which Maoists carry out attacks between April and July every year also took place,” said another IPS officer, preferring anonymity.The officer further said that there were three main objectives behind the meeting.“Firstly, to emphasise that Maoists would still rule the jungles of Bastar in spite of death of Ramanna and would carry forward his legacy. Secondly to show of strength that villagers are with them and thirdly to discuss over the successor of Ramanna. The Maoists have also displayed the arms, which they have looted in Minpa attack (Sukma district) in which 17 jawans were killed in March this year,” said the officer.Bela Bhatia, a human rights activist based in Bastar in Chhattisgarh said, “This gathering of thousands of emphasised the need of public education, measures specially education and health.”Total size of Bastar division is 39,117 square kilometre and population is 15 lakh.There are seven districts in Bastar division which include Kanker, Kondagaon, Jagdalpur, Dantewada, Sukma, Bijapur and Narayanpur.As per police estimate, about 4,500 Maoist cadre (from its political and military wings) live in the jungles of Bastar. More than 2,00,000 people including women and children in Bastar are Sangham Sadasya (members) of CPI (Maoist).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-organise-meeting-in-chhattisgarh-10-000-people-attend/story-tNVdUFoXhFYwQ6YdguPEyM.html

But we have heard, people are talking about it, satellite images show, Ladakh’s residents and retired generals of the army are saying that China has snatched away our land. China has taken away our land not just at one place but in three areas,” Rahul Gandhi said during a virtual address.The Congress leader was referring to PM Modi’s comments at the all-party meeting that “no one has entered our territory, no one is at present within our territory and no one has occupied our posts”. “Prime Minister ji, you will have to speak the truth and tell the country. There is no need to get flustered. If you say no land was taken away and the truth is otherwise, it will be China’s gain,” he said.“We need to put up a fight together and throw them away. You will have to speak the truth without getting flustered and getting scared that yes China has taken over our land and we are going to take action. The entire country will stand by you,” he said.Gandhi’s next question was about soldiers on the border.“Who sent our brave soldiers without weapons and why?” he asked.Rahul Gandhi’s comments came almost at the same time as Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s address about the border issue.“The Prime Minister says China didn’t infiltrate but, on the other hand, the defence ministry and external affairs ministry keep discussing the large presence of and intrusions by the Chinese…,” Sonia Gandhi said.“Today, when we’re paying tribute to our martyrs, the country wants to know if China has not captured our land in Ladakh, as claimed by PM, then why and how were our 20 soldiers martyred,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-be-scared-speak-the-truth-rahul-gandhi-to-pm-modi-in-this-latest-attack-on-chinese-intrusion/story-tDQtKGfr4v5Gqx46swlg8I.html

Is our territorial integrity being violated by China in Ladakh? Will the Prime Minister take the nation in confidence on the situation at the border?” Gandhi asked.She said the government should give full support and strength to the Army, saying “this will be true patriotism”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-china-hasn-t-occupied-territory-why-were-our-20-soldiers-martyred-asks-sonia-gandhi/story-kJDF2bjWB7Xo3COgnb33ZP.html

ITBP chief said that the forces’ experience in handling mass Covid treatment and quarantine facilities will come in handy in managing the facility that boasts of over 10,000 beds.“ITBP has gained experience in the last 4 months. Initially we managed a Covid quarantine center in Chhawla & then our 200 bedded hospital in Noida. Our medical team will help people in this crisis,” Deswal was quoted as saying by ANI.Earlier this year, the ITBP had created and managed a 1,000 bed quarantine centre in south-west Delhi. The Chhawla centre had treated about 1,200 people who arrived in the country on special evacuation flights from China and Italy after the outbreak of the disease. It is also credited with coming up with the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the containment of the pandemic among the various Central Armed Police Forces and central and state police organisations.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“Security forces & Armed Police forces are dedicated to the nation to deal with all kinds of situations. All challenges will be faced. Be it Army or ITBP they are dedicated to the nation for protection of integrity, sovereignty and borders of the nation,” ITBP DG SS Deswal said in reference to the multiple roles played by the armed forces of the country.Apart from handling a medical-humanitarian crisis in Delhi, ITBP is currently deployed along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh, where border tensions with China have peaked in the past couple of months following incursions by the red army and clashes between the soldiers of two sides due to differing perceptions of territories.The Radha Soami Beas establishment in Chhatarpur area of the national capital, will have two segments -- a Covid care centre (CCC) where asymptomatic positive cases will be treated and a dedicated Covid healthcare centre (DCHC). The CCC will have 90 per cent beds, while DCHC will have 10 per cent beds and the latter segment will also have an oxygen support system.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesITBP took over the management of the centre on Wednesday on the request of the Union home ministry.Deswal interacted with a team of doctors and paramedics who would run the facility and was updated about the medical and administrative protocols to be followed at the facility.A team of over 1,000 doctors, nurses and paramedic staff of the ITBP and other paramilitary forces have been earmarked to work at the facility, a senior officer quoted by PTI said.One thousand more ancillary and security staff will be deployed at the facility along with 75 ambulances, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/itbp-chief-visits-india-s-largest-covid-19-care-centre-with-10-000-beds-says-force-will-deal-with-any-challenge/story-hnf2gs0cweBYCgmkW4bq2J.html
26-06-2020||India||Cut money tag returns in garb of nepotism for TMC in Bengal’s Amphan-hit districts||Alleged nepotism by Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders and workers involved in distribution of compensation in districts hit by Cyclone Amphan has revived the ghost of “cut money” or illegal commission they charged from beneficiaries of rural housing schemes in the past.The allegations have led to clashes and protests with governor Jagdeep Dhankhar tweeting on Friday that the law and order situation in three districts was “worrisome”.A majority of the people’s representatives in the cyclone-affected districts belong to the TMC. Villagers in around a dozen panchayat areas have alleged that the sum of Rs 20,000 that the state has sanctioned for repairing damaged houses is being given to people who are close to the ruling party and own houses that have suffered no damage. There are also allegations that people, many of whom are jobless migrant labourers, are not getting work under the MGNREGA projects.After the cyclone, the state government told the visiting inter-ministerial central team that the quantum of damage caused by the cyclone stood at Rs 1.02 lakh crore. The state’s report said 28.6 lakh houses and 17 lakh hectares of farmland were damaged while damage done to dwellings stood at Rs 28,560 crore.On Monday, a panchayat office and the home of a TMC leader were ransacked by the party’s supporters at Sagar in South 24 Parganas district and the office of the community block development officer (BDO) at Deganga in adjoining North 24 Parganas district was vandalized. Fifteen people, including some college students, were arrested in Deganga.On Tuesday, there was unrest at Mathurapur in the South 24 Parganas and Nandakumar in East Midnapore. On Wednesday, BJP and TMC workers clashed at Bhagabanpore in East Midnapore district when the opposition party demanded scrutiny of the beneficiaries. On Thursday, there was a clash at Amdanga in North 24 Parganas.On Friday morning, Dhankhar tweeted, “Protests @MamataOfficial over corruption, nepotism and politicization #Amphan relief distribution is rocking the state. Worrisome law and order scenario in East Midnapore, South and North 24 Parganas as BDO offices are being gheraoed.”“Lip facade will not work. Officials @MamataOfficial must face consequences for such omission acts and abandonment of their work to political party. Officials must be booked for acts of omission and commission. Non entitled beneficiaries be penalized and benefit retrieved,” Dhankhar said in another tweet.The incidents triggered a debate at the all-party meeting that chief minister Mamata Banerjee convened on June 24, primarily to discuss the Covid-19 crisis, said BJP, Left and Congress leaders who took part. “Everybody should get compensation. Political background of people should not be considered. I request people not to vandalize officers of the BDOs. The administration will prepare the list of beneficiaries,” Banerjee said after the all-party meeting. The agitations, however, did not stop.Opposition leaders said that at the meeting Banerjee told them that the unrest was a stray incident and there was no large-scale nepotism as alleged.“According to our conservative estimate anything between Rs 250 and 300 crore has been distributed among people who are not entitled,” said BJP vice president Jay Prakash Majumdar who attended the all-party meet along with BJP state president Dilip Ghosh. To the opposition parties, the alleged corruption in cyclone-hit districts is just another avatar of the “cut money” scandal that rocked Bengal a year ago. It became one of the key issues in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the principal opposition force, won 18 of the state’s 42 seats.While addressing a TMC meeting on June 18 last year, Banerjee asked party leaders to return the “cut money” they took from people and exposed corrupt functionaries to public scrutiny. Her statement became a political weapon for the BJP which had just won 18 Lok Sabha seats even as the TMC claimed that 99.99 % of its leaders and workers were honest and that the CM’s warning was meant for just 0.01%.Soon after this, ‘Didi ke Bolo’ (Tell Didi) a helpline planned by election strategist and Banerjee’s advisor Prasant Kishor to let people to reach out to the government with their grievances led to thousands of complaints against party leaders. Most of these were against panchayat and district leaders.“TMC can never change its character no matter how loudly the chief minister may have claimed that there is no corruption in distribution of compensation. We have demanded an all-party monitoring committee,” said Congress state president Somen Mitra.“This is the last opportunity for TMC workers to make money because they know the party will be out of power in 2021,” said Sujan Chakraborty, Communist Party of India (Marxist) legislator and leader of the Left parties in the state assembly.“The allegations have surfaced because the government allowed panchayat leaders to select beneficiaries. The job should have been done by the administration right from the beginning,” said Kolkata-based political science professor Udayan Bandopadhyay.“Those who own brick and concrete houses cannot claim compensation. People who misrepresented facts will have to return the money,” a BDO in South 24 Parganas said on condition of anonymity.Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the affected areas in Bengal and Odisha within 48 hours of the cyclone. He announced an initial grant of Rs 1,000 crore for relief and rehabilitation in Bengal and assured both states of more support after conducting separate aerial surveys with Mamata Banerjee and Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cut-money-tag-returns-in-garb-of-nepotism-for-tmc-in-bengal-s-amphan-hit-districts/story-YJmz3QlI6P2HMlGF8OeoBP.html

26-06-2020||India||Bengal woman finds out she is a man after 30 yrs, has rare condition||For thirty years she led a normal life with no complications, until recently, when doctors, while treating her for abdominal pain, discovered that she was a ‘man’ suffering from testicular cancer.Surprisingly, her 28-year-old sister, who underwent necessary tests following the revelation, was also diagnosed with ‘Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome’ -- a condition in which a person is born genetically male, but has all physical traits of a woman.The 30-year-old Birbhum resident, married for the last nine years, had visited city-based Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Cancer Hospital with severe pain in lower abdomen a couple of months ago, following which clinical oncologist Dr Anupam Dutta and surgical oncologist Dr Soumen Das conducted her medical tests, and found out her “true identity”.“From her appearance, she is a woman. Starting from her voice, developed breasts, normal external genitalia, everything is that of a woman. However, uterus and ovaries have been absent since birth. She has also never experienced menstruation,” Dr Dutta told PTI.It’s a very rare condition, and can be found one in every 22,000 people, he said.After test reports suggested that the person has a “blind vagina”, doctors decided to conduct Karyotyping test, which revealed that her chromosome complement was ‘XY’ and not ‘XX’, as found in a woman.“We conducted clinical examinations, after she complained of abdominal pain, and found out she has testicles inside her body. A biopsy was conducted, following which she was diagnosed with testicular cancer, also called seminoma, Dr Dutta explained.Currently, she is undergoing chemotheraphy and her health condition is stable.“As her testicles remained undeveloped inside the body, there was no secretion of testosterone. Her female hormones, on the other hand, gave her the appearance of a woman,” Dr Dutta stated.Asked about her reaction to the revelation, he said, “The person has grown up to be a woman. She is married to man for almost a decade. Currently, we are counselling the patient and her husband, advising them to continue living life as they have been.” It was learnt, that the couple had tried for babies a number of times but failed.The patient’s two maternal aunts were also diagnosed with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome in the past, the oncologist said.“It’s probably in the genes. We have come to know that two of her aunts from the maternal side were also suffering from similar condition,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-finds-out-she-is-a-man-during-treatment-at-kolkata-hospital/story-elbGDFWb3Qy6BQrfejoZaK.html

26-06-2020||India||CBI teams, complete with PPE kits, raid Ratul Puri in new Rs 780 cr bank loan case||The Central Bureau of Investigation on Friday carried out searches in premises linked to Ratul Puri, the nephew of former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath. The raids are being conducted in Delhi and Noida in connection with a new FIR filed against Ratul Puri and father Deepak Puri, both directors of Moser Baer Solar Ltd, in a case related to alleged loss of Rs 787 crore to a consortium of banks.State-run Punjab National Bank, which had played a lead role in this consortium, had complained to the CBI.“In the view of Covid-19, all precautions regarding health and safety are being taken while conducting the searches including provision of PPE (personal protection equipment) kits to all the search teams”, says RK Gaur, CBI Spokesperson.A CBI official said a fresh case was registered against Ratul Puri on the basis of the Punjab National Bank’s complaint.This is the CBI’s second FIR against him. He was named in a Rs 354 crore bank fraud case in August last year.The Enforcement Directorate had also moved in, accusing him of involvement in bank frauds amounting to Rs 7,900 crore. In its charge-sheet, the Enforcement Directorate had alleged that Ratul Puri misused funds loaned from the bank to maintain a lavish lifestyle including holidays abroad and travel in private jets.Puri, a key accused in the money laundering probe linked to the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper purchase scam, was arrested in August last year and eventually released on bail in December.Former chief minister Kamal Nath had accused the BJP of orchestrating raids by central agencies, claiming that the investigation against Ratul Puri was a victim of political vendetta.The probe agencies, which have attempted to tie Puri to the VVIP chopper scandal, have said they had found print-outs of emails that is alleged to link Puri to corporate entities allegedly created to park money received as kickbacks in the AgustaWestland deal.The AgustaWestland case centres on allegations that bribes were paid to middlemen, perhaps even politicians, when India agreed to buy 12 AgustaWestland helicopters built by Italian defence manufacturing giant Finmeccanica (now known as the Leonardo group) at an estimated cost of Rs 3,600 crore. The helicopters, manufactured by Finmeccanica’s British subsidiary AgustaWestland were for the “Communication Squadron of the Indian Air Force”.The purchase, cleared in 2010 by the previous United Progressive Alliance government, envisaged replacing ageing Mi-8 choppers to ferry VVIPs like the President, vice-president, Prime Minister and the other dignitaries. The deal was scrapped in 2014 over alleged breach of contractual obligations and charges of payment of kickbacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-raids-premises-linked-to-ratul-puri-in-delhi-noida-in-new-rs-780-cr-fraud/story-BnnsF1Sq0gKtLFelMu6hcL.html
26-06-2020||India||Shivalik forest awaits tiger’s roar, will be UP’s fourth tiger reserve||The proposal to declare Shivalik forest in western Uttar Pradesh as a tiger reserve is gaining support among officials, experts and wildlife enthusiasts.Spread over 33,200 hectares, the forest is located at the foothills of the Shivalik range close to the Rajaji National Park in Uttarakhand on the route to Dehradun from Delhi in the Saharanpur circle.Principal chief conservator of forest (Wildlife) of Uttar Pradesh Sunil Pandey said the proposal for declaring Shivalik forest as a tiger reserve had been received. “After going through it, I can say it has immense potential,” he said.The proposal would soon be forwarded to the central government which alone can take a final decision on the matter, he added.Once the proposal is officially accepted, it would be the fourth tiger reserve of UP and the second one in western UP. Amangarh in Bijnor district is western UP’s first tiger reserve near Jim Corbett National Park. Dushwa and Pilibhit are the other tiger reserves in the state.The Uttarakhand government’s plan to translocate a few tigers in the nearby Motichur range of Rajaji National Park from other places in the hill state would strengthen the proposal to declare Shivalik forest as a tiger reserve due to its proximity, said VK Jain, Saharanpur division’s chief conservator of forests.Jain said direct sighting of tigers were reported in the forest till 2005 and many people claimed such sightings till 2008-09. He is hopeful the region could be transformed into an eco tourism spot.“Proximity to Dehradun and good connectivity by road, train and air would help in attracting wildlife enthusiasts and tourists. This point has also been well taken in the proposal,” he said.Stretching till the boundary of the Kalesar wildlife sanctuary in Haryana and the Simbalbara National Park in Himachal Pradesh, the Shivalik forest includes Badkala, Shakumbhai and Mohand forest ranges of the Saharanpur circle.While man-animal conflicts are reported from other areas, the Shivalik region seldom witnesses such incidents.Saharanpur divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar said developing Shivalik tiger reserve would help in strengthening the rich biodiversity and wildlife conservation in the entire region.The forest department has carried out an intensive six-month trap camera survey in the forest with technical and other assistance from experts of Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The survey counted a population of over 50 leopards, different herbivorous animals, civets, snakes and species of birds, which indicates it has a rich biodiversity to support the presence of tigers.After the translocation of tigers in western Rajaji Park, these big cats could venture into the Shivalik forest in the next few years, turning it into a potential corridor for tigers, said Dr Vibhas Pandav, a scientist with the Wildlife Institute of India.“The latest survey of the area suggests it is full of herbivorous and other animals. Therefore, it is perfect for the relocation of tigers,” he added. He, however, highlighted the need for reducing human pressure inside and outside the forest.“The population of Gujjars inside the forest could be moved out and rehabilitated,” said Dr Pandav.Divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar said 400 families of Van Gujjars lived inside the forest and earned their livelihood by selling milk. Each family has its own herd of buffaloes. He said 40 families would be rehabilitated in two months and the process would continue until all families were relocated and benefitted from government schemes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shivalik-forest-awaits-tiger-s-roar-will-be-up-s-third-tiger-reserve/story-1LadebuH7l97vVfTyjyPQM.html
26-06-2020||India||Tribals in 3 states against Centre’s decision to auction coal mines, say it would displace them||Close to 20,000 families would be displaced because of the commercial licenses given for coal mines in Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, according to the official estimates of these states.In addition, the officials in these states said that thousands of trees will have to be cut for these mining projects, which could adversely impact the local environment.The central government had, on June 18, approved auction of 41 coal mines for commercial usage to private players. Jharkhand government has filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the Centre’s decision saying it will have adverse environmental impact on the tribal areas and revenue generation will also be less than expected.Of the 41 coal blocks, there are nine each in Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh. In each state, 8,000 to 10,000 families will get displaced depending on how much land is acquired for the mining purpose, officials of these states privy to the mining work said.The nine coal blocks in Jharkhand is spread over 47.55 square kilometres in 10 districts. Of these, four coal blocks are in Latehar district, and one each in Dumka, Pakur, Palamu, Giridih, Hazaribag and in Bokaro. “About 30-32 villages need to be shifted in the 10 districts of Jharkhand for mining operations, as per the details of exploration documents of various drilling companies engaged to prepare the road maps,” said a Jharkhand government official, who was not willing to be quoted.Eight of the nine mines in Odisha are in Angul district, where about 32,000 hectares of the land will have to be acquired for mining, which could lead to displacement of up to 10,000 families. Odisha steel and mines secretary RK Sharma said the state government is yet to estimate how many people would be finally be affected.Environmentalists say the proposed auctioning of nine coal blocks - Machhakata, Mahanadi, Chhendipada-I, Chhendipada-II, Brahmanbil-Kardabahal combined, Phuljhari (East & West), Radhikapur (East), Radhikapur (West) - in Angul and Kurloi(A) North in Jharsuguda district may turn out to be the largest-ever displacement exercise in eastern India more than 10,000 families are likely to be displaced by the open cast coal mining in these coal mines.“The auction of these coal block at one go would not just devastate the lives of thousands of families, they would alter the landscape for all time to come putting in peril the lives of wildlife in the region. Angul district is already among the most critically polluted areas of the state as per Central Pollution Control Board due to coal mining in Talcher area. Once these 8 blocks are mined, living in Angul would be nothing less than a nightmarish experience,” said noted environmentalist and wildlife activist Biswajit Mohanty.All the nine coal blocks in Chhattisgarh were allotted to different companies before 2015 and have got all relevant clearances of the Union government, said a state government official, who was not willing to be named. The Chhattisgarh government is opposing auction of five coal blocks in Hasdev Arand Forest division as they would lead to diversion of forest land from Lemru Elephant Reserve. Last Friday, Chhattisgarh forest minister Mohammad Akbar had written a letter opposing auctioning of mines in the reserve saying it will destroy the Hasdev Arand forest spanning across 170,000 hectares.The state government officials say a large number of people will be displaced but activists put the number to about 7,000-8,000 people. “As per my estimate around 7,000-8,000 people will be displaced in these area and around 25-30 lakh trees would be logged in this process, if all the nine coal blocks are auctioned,” said Alok Shukla, convenor of Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan, who is working for tribal rights in these area for last 10 years.However, Chhattisgarh government has no issues with auctioning of other four coal mines - Gare Palema (4/1), Gare Palema (4/7), Shankarpur Bhatgaon (second extension) and Sondhia - which fall in the Surguja region and are not part of Hasdeo Arand forest.In all the three states, opposition at the local level has started against auctioning of these mines and trade unions have called for a three-day strike against the Centre’s decision.Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU) leader, D Ramanandan, said it’s a unilateral decision of the Centre to provide the coal blocks to a select group of companies at throwaway prices. He said the trade unions will oppose the decision till the government shelves its plan. Fearing the worst in terms of displacement, large scale impact on environment and livelihood, the leaders of Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha (a people’s organisation), said that the move will adversely impact the ownership right of local leaders. “The decision was taken without consulting the gram sabha (a decision making body of all villagers),” said mahasabha leader Elina Horo.Smita Patnaik, a woman leader who heads an NGO called Nari Suraksha Manch in Odisha’s Angul district, said people will oppose the auction as price for mining was already being paid. “We are already facing the perils of coal mining by Coal India in Talcher as the coal dust is polluting our water-bodies and air. There is already rising number of cancer cases and several respiratory diseases in the district due to coal mining. Once 8 blocks in Chhendipada are mined, the area would literally be hell,” said Patnaik.Environmental lawyer Sankar Pani said the auction will displace the farming community in Angul as 80 per cent of the people in the district are farmers. “These people get two crops a year as there is irrigation facility. What is likely to trigger public opposition is the auctioning of all the coal blocks at one go, rather than in a staggered fashion,” said Pani. In Chhattisgarh, gram sabhas of villages falling in Hasdeo Arand have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi last Tuesday, asking him to stop the auction of five coal blocks in the region for commercial mining as it would hamper their livelihood and culture.“As per my estimate about 25-30 lakh trees are there in the area of these coal blocks. The mining will pollute the Hansdeo river. And the mining will impact the home of elephants in Hansdeo Arand and its catchment area,” said Sudeip Shrivastava, an environment lawyer and activist of Chhattisgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tribals-in-3-states-against-centre-s-decision-to-auction-coal-mines-say-it-would-displace-them/story-ZLV9t7RubQdO6iiYOUqTCM.html

Some unknown persons and bank officials have also been named by the PNB.These raids are in connection with the fresh case. Puri is the nephew of senior Congress leader Kamal Nath.“In the view of Covid-19, all precautions regarding health and safety are being taken while conducting the searches including provision of PPE kits to all the search teams,” CBI Spokesperson RK Gaur said.Moser Baer is involved in the manufacture of optical storage media like compact discs, DVDs, solid state storage devices.The latest FIR by the CBI is second against Puri; he was earlier booked in August 2019 in Rs 354 crore Central Bank fraud. In its complaint, the Central Bank had claimed that Moser Baer was taking loans from various banks since 2009 and went for debt restructuring a number of times. When it was unable to pay the debt, a forensic audit was done and the account was declared as “fraud” by the bank on April 20, 2019, it further alleged.In October 2019, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had filed a charge sheet against Puri, alleging that he was involved in bank frauds amounting to Rs 7,900 crore.In its charge sheet, the ED had claimed that Puri was living a lavish lifestyle with the banks’ money, which included holidays abroad, travelling in private jets and visiting night clubs.Puri is a key accused in money laundering probe in AgustaWestland scam as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-raids-ratul-puri-s-premises-in-connection-with-alleged-loss-of-rs-787-crore-to-pnb-and-other-banks/story-9Xi380kIr5tJuSAta0EtVN.html

He concluded that “blocking access achieves next to nothing” and didn’t want “to lull an applicant into a hollow and faux sense of safety”.Justice Patel suggested that HUL should take up the matter with the domain name registrars concerned for suspending the offender, and could move a fresh plea in the HC, if the matter is still unresolved.Earlier, HUL had moved court, seeking orders for suspending and blocking several websites and e-mail addresses using its generic name or it’s deceptively similar variants.The company had filed the case after it noticed that its name was fraudulently used for duping unsuspecting consumers by fake dealers of HUL products. Some consumers were duped over Rs 70 lakh by a fraudulent website.The court observed that the registration of these domain names was mala fide and an infringement of HUL’s statutory and common law rights.However, the bench rejected HUL’s other plea, urging the court to find a suitable mechanism and pass orders to deal with fraudulent domain names, websites, and e-mail addresses that might cause damage to the company’s business prospects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/courts-cannot-provide-permanent-protection-against-cyber-fraud-bombay-hc-to-hul/story-dL0Rj3awDYRDGQu2hegClK.html

26-06-2020||India||In Priyanka Gandhi’s double-barrelled attack on UP govt, Mayawati also target||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday asserted she is former prime minister Indira Gandhi’s granddaughter and dared the Uttar Pradesh government to take action against her for “speaking the truth”.She also launched a veiled attack on Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati, calling her an “undeclared BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) spokesperson”.In a series of tweets, Priyanka Gandhi alleged that the Uttar Pradesh government is threatening her through various departments for speaking the truth.“I am Indira Gandhi’s granddaughter and not an undeclared BJP spokesperson like some of the opposition leaders,” she said.The attack came a day after the Uttar Pradesh State Commission for Protection of Child Rights issued a notice to Priyanka Gandhi, asking her to file a reply within three days for her “misleading” comment on the Kanpur shelter home where 57 girls tested positive for Covid-19.In another development, the Agra administration asked her to withdraw a claim about a high number of Coronavirus deaths in the district.In a Facebook post on Sunday, she attacked the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh over a media report about two girls being found pregnant in the state-run child shelter home, saying it showed facts were being suppressed in the name of investigation at such facilities.“As a servant of the people, my duty is towards the people of Uttar Pradesh. And this duty is to put out the truth before them and not to put forth government propaganda. The UP government is wasting its time by threatening me through its various departments,” Priyanka Gandhi tweeted in Hindi on Friday. “They can take whatever action they want. I will keep putting forth the truth.”Though she did not name Mayawati while tweeting about “an undeclared BJP spokesperson”, the target was obvious.Mayawati has repeatedly backed the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre on the border standoff with China in Galwan Valley of eastern Ladakh.In one of her tweets last week, the BSP chief said the people of India are confident that the Centre would “take the right decisions to keep the honour, pride and glory of the country intact and never allow anyone to grab even an inch of land”.She had taken a similar stand at the all-party meeting called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 19 to discuss the border situation.Much to the surprise of other opposition leaders, Mayawati has been praising the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh on various issues, including its arrangements to send migrant workers home and its handling of the attacks on Dalits in the state by acting promptly against the perpetrators.While she had described Priyanka Gandhi’s offer of buses to ferry the migrant workers as a “’political ploy”, Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya called her “twitter-wali neta” for her sustained attacks on the state government.The relations between the BSP chief and the Congress soured after a warm and affectionate hug between Sonia Gandhi and Mayawati at the swearing-in ceremony of Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy in May 2018.Not only did Mayawati field her candidates in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh during assembly elections in 2018 despite the Congress pushing for a tie-up, she ensured that the grand old party did not become part of a broad-based alliance in Uttar Pradesh for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls after joining hands with arch-rival Samajwadi Party (SP).However, she has been soft on both Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, saying their intentions for a Congress-BSP alliance were honest.The Congress leadership too has so far avoided criticism of Mayawati, with Rahul Gandhi saying he “respected her contribution to the country and considered her a national symbol”.But whether that mutual respect will remain or swords will get further sharpened on both sides will be known in the run-up to assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, given that Priyanka Gandhi is focussed on reviving the Congress in the country’s politically important state. The elections are due in Uttar Pradesh in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-am-indira-gandhi-s-granddaughter-not-undeclared-bjp-spokesperson-priyanka-s-barb-at-mayawati/story-193rq6CBTgI86ZOf3iQOxN.html

He understood what is happening in big countries. In view of this, he and his government worked on a war footing. He used full strength to construct quarantine centres and facilities for isolation.”The Prime Minister said the efforts and achievements of Uttar Pradesh are huge because it is not just a state, but it is a bigger state than many countries of the world. “People of UP are realising this achievement themselves but if you know the figures you will be surprised even more,” he said.He gave the examples of England, France, Italy and Spain, among the countries badly hit by the pandemic and have a population equal to that of the Indian state, and said there are as many people in Uttar Pradesh, which has tackled the crisis well.“The hard work that the government of UP has put in, we can say that in a way it has managed to save the lives of at least 85 thousand people. Today if we are able to save the lives of our citizens, then it is also a matter of great satisfaction,” he said.The Atma Nirbhar Uttar Pradesh Rojgar Abhiyan, which was launched by PM Modi virtually, will provide employment to 1.25 crore migrant workers and cover 31 districts of the state. More than 30 lakh migrant labourers have returned UP following the lockdown clamped in the country. It will be undertaken as part of the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan that the Prime Minister started on June 20 for 116 districts in six states in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-s-effort-in-fighting-covid-19-unprecedented-praiseworthy-pm-modi/story-fW1LVjIA0BoluIEBf8P1dN.html
26-06-2020||India||Monsoon covers entire country, 12 days in advance||The monsoon has covered the entire country on Friday, 12 days earlier than expected, with officials saying this would augur well for farmers. The monsoon usually covers the whole country by July 8.Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting centre, said: “Good rains on Friday helped the monsoon current surge further. There was a trough of low pressure running from Punjab and over north Rajasthan, Bihar and West Bengal, which helped the monsoon cover the entire country well in advance. This should be good news for farmers.”There will be a brief lull in monsoon rains now, according to scientists of the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Due to the shifting of the monsoon trough northwards and convergence of strong southerly and south-westerly winds from Bay of Bengal over northeast and adjoining east India, widespread and heavy to very heavy rainfall will continue over northeast and east India during the next three days.Extremely heavy rainfall is likely over Bihar and Assam and Meghalaya during June 26 and 27, and over Arunachal Pradesh and sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim on June 26.“The large-scale features which ensured we have a good monsoon are a neutral El Nino and neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). At a local level, we had some low-pressure systems developing during the monsoon. We also had a cyclonic circulation over central India, which helped bring good rains and advanced the monsoon current,” said IMD director general M Mohapatra.“Now the monsoon trough is shifting northwards, and so for three to four days, there will be very heavy and widespread rains in the eastern Himalayan foothills, Bihar and the northeastern states. There will be no rain in central India during this period, and the monsoon will advance very slowly. July and August are very important months for agriculture, and we are expecting a favourable monsoon during those two months,” he added.El Nino is a climate pattern characterised by high sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, which are neutral now. El Nino years in India are linked to below normal monsoon rains, and higher than normal frequency of heat waves.Last year, weak El Nino conditions prevailed, leading to the delayed onset of the monsoon, according to scientists. IOD is characterised by warmer sea surface temperature in the equatorial Indian Ocean, and positive IOD conditions are associated with a normal monsoon over India.A good monsoon, which accounts for 70% of India’s annual rainfall, is critical to the fortunes of the agricultural sector, on which at least 700 million people are dependent for a livelihood. The monsoon is crucial for the yield of rice, wheat, sugarcane and oilseeds in a country where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy but employs more than half of its people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-covers-entire-country-12-days-in-advance/story-V32EyT4UKG9jbmFCuKCwWO.html

From over 6,000 a day, the daily caseload has now crossed 17,000.On Friday, India recorded 17,296 fresh cases of the coronavirus disease - the country’s highest single-day surge.

Will you do it? You must let them study even if you face adversity,” the Prime Minister said.“Will you write to me every year about your children’s education and how your children are faring? So, you will have to fulfil this promise. You must do it for the country’s progress,” he said.The Atma Nirbhar Uttar Pradesh Rojgar Abhiyan, which was launched by PM Modi virtually, will cover 31 districts of Uttar Pradesh, which has seen more than 30 lakh migrant labourers return home following the lockdown in the country. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath was also present during the virtual launch of the Atma Nirbhar Uttar Pradesh Rojgar Abhiyan.It will be undertaken as part of the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan that the Prime Minister started on June 20 for 116 districts in six states in the country, Officials have said that the Atmanirbhar UP Rojgar Abhiyan is focused on providing jobs, promoting local entrepreneurship and creating partnerships with industrial associations and other organisations to create employment opportunities.They have said the target of providing work has been given to different departments with a focus on 25 categories of works.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-pm-launches-atma-nirbhar-up-rojgar-abhiyan-he-seeks-a-promise/story-MXQjzOJXXhBUqWOpkIEctM.html
26-06-2020||India||Children as young as 14 are being used by terrorists in J&K: US state dept||The US state department has said in a new report that children as young as 14 are recruited and used by non-state armed groups, referring to terror organisations, against the government in Jammu and Kashmir. The latest “Trafficking in Persons Report 2019”, released on Thursday, also said children aged just 12 are forcibly used by Maoist rebels to handle weapons and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and in some cases, act as human shields.The report further said Maoist rebels indulge in sexual slavery in their camps, citing several women and girls earlier associated with Maoist groups.The use of “child soldiers” for propaganda was particularly rampant in the left-wing extremism (LWE) affected states of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, the report said.Asserting that India doesn’t fully meet the minimum standards for eliminating human trafficking, the US has kept it in the Tier 2 category of countries on the basis of its efforts. India has been placed in the Tier 2 category on human trafficking for almost a decade.To put things in context, Tier 2 ranking is given to those countries which have not fully complied with human trafficking measures but are making efforts. Tier 1 are those countries who have fully complied with the measures. The report said physical violence against trafficking victims – in terms of both forced labour and sex trafficking – is prevalent in India and “some traffickers force women and girls to conceive and deliver babies for sale”.“Traffickers exploit millions of people in commercial sex within India. Traffickers target Indian women and girls but also fraudulently recruit significant numbers of Nepali and Bangladeshi women and girls to India for sex trafficking. Additionally, traffickers exploit women and girls from Central Asian, European, and African countries in commercial sex, especially in Goa,” the report said.It said that “India is a source of child sex tourists and a destination for child sex tourism”.The report added, “Traffickers kidnap and force Indian and Nepali women and girls to work as ‘orchestra dancers’ in India, especially in Bihar state, where girls perform with dance groups until they have repaid fabricated debts. Traffickers exploit women and children in sex trafficking in religious pilgrimage centres and in tourist destinations.”The report pointed out that human traffickers are increasingly using online technology to facilitate sex trafficking and fraudulent recruitment.“Some traffickers kidnap children from public places, including railway stations, entice girls with drugs, and force girls as young as 5 years old in sex trafficking to take hormone injections to appear older,” it said.In this, the report observed, some corrupt law enforcement officers have a major role to play as they “protect suspected traffickers and brothel owners from law enforcement efforts and take bribes from sex trafficking establishments and sexual services from victims”. Not just that, the report noted that traffickers arrange sham marriages within India and West Asian states to subject females to sex trafficking.According to the report, authorities have recently identified Indian forced labour victims in Armenia, Portugal, Gabon, and Zambia, and Indian female sex trafficking victims in Kenya.“Traffickers exploit Rohingya, Sri Lankan Tamil, and other refugee populations in sex and labour trafficking. Traffickers subject some boys from Assam, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh states to forced labour in Nepal,” it added.Criticising the Indian government, the US state department said that “the government decreased investigations, prosecutions, and case convictions of traffickers, and the acquittal rate for traffickers increased to 83%”.It added, “Law enforcement decreased victim identification efforts, and the government reported it had only identified approximately 313,000 bonded labourers since 1976 — less than four percent of NGOs’ estimates of at least eight million trafficking victims in India, the majority of which are bonded labourers.”It further said: “NGOs estimated police did not file FIRs in at least half of reported bonded labour cases, and inconsistent with NGO reports, 17 of 36 states and territories did not identify any bonded labour victims in 2017 or 2018.” Citing data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the report said that in 2018, the Indian government reported 1,830 trafficking cases under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), a continued decrease from 2,854 cases in 2017 and 5,217 cases in 2016.The US report has a specific mention of the CBI probe into the sexual abuse of girls and boys in shelter homes in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.The CBI, the report said, completed investigations into the 16 most abusive shelters and filed charges in 12 additional cases. The CBI filed an additional 19 FIRs against some of the 94 other state-funded shelter homes in Bihar.“Despite this action in Bihar, the lack of investigations into suspected trafficking crimes and broader physical and sexual abuse of trafficking victims at government-run and -funded shelters in other states due to widespread negligence created an atmosphere of impunity for shelter employees and government officials to engage in trafficking,” the report said.The report particularly blamed Indian police for widespread impunity for trafficking crimes.“Some police and administration officials maintained the view that society had the right to put lower caste individuals in bonded and child labour, which sometimes impeded identification and investigation of such cases. NGOs across multiple states reported politically connected individuals, including local and state politicians who held workers in bonded labour in agriculture and on brick kilns, successfully avoided prosecution. Some law enforcement reportedly received bribes from sex trafficking establishments and sexual services from victims in exchange for alerting the traffickers of forthcoming raids,” it said.“The lack of sufficient political will across many states to address bonded labour stymied efforts nationwide,” it added.Prakash Singh, a former police chief of Uttar Pradesh, said: “The problem is definitely there. It is an acknowledged fact which has been accepted by the Indian government that Naxals use children for carrying items or even using them as informers.”Singh added, “Yes, Indian police have problems but they have a very thankless task to perform, where they have to follow orders of the political class.

And this duty is to put out the truth before them and not to put forth government propaganda. The UP government is wasting its time by threatening me through its various departments,” Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi on Friday “They can take whatever action they want, I will keep putting forth the truth. I am Indira Gandhi’s granddaughter not an undeclared BJP spokesperson like some of the opposition leaders,” she said.Her remarks also come days after the Agra administration asked her to withdraw the claim of high coronavirus deaths in the district.The Congress general secretary in-charge UP East has accused the Yogi Adityanath government of indulging in propaganda instead of dealing with the pandemic.This week, Priyanka Gandhi repeatedly attacked the Uttar Pradesh government over the “high” Covid-19 mortality rate in Agra and on other issues related to the state government’s handling of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-am-indira-gandhi-s-granddaughter-priyanka-dares-up-govt/story-EKkQQfrv8QTiMSnqiXdGZI.html

26-06-2020||India||UP firms making bullet proof jackets ditch China, say ‘no trust’: Report||Kanpur, one of the leading centres for making bullet proof jackets for Indian soldiers, has banned Chinese products, Hindustan Times’ sister publication Hindustan reported on Friday.The companies based in Kanpur have turned towards European and American firms to procure raw materials to build body armour and jackets which save lives of soldiers, Hindustan further reported.Earlier this week, Niti Aayog member V K Saraswat had said that Indian companies manufacturing bullet proof jackets should avoid importing raw materials from China because of “inconsistencies in the quality” of the shipments.“Many times raw materials imported from China (to produce bullet proof jackets) are not of good quality... We should avoid importing from Chinese sources because of inconsistencies of the raw material quality,” Saraswat told news agency PTI on Monday.Saraswat, also a former Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) chief, said companies producing bullet proof jackets for the army can get raw material from other sources that are the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) production agencies.The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) had asked Niti Aayog to prepare a road map for “incentivising” domestic manufacturing of lightweight body armours and protective gears. The Bureau of Indian Standards has also finalised quality norms for body armours to be used by Indian forces.The clamour for boycott of Chinese goods has been growing ever since the Ladakh-face off in the Galwan Valley on June 15.These jackets use fibre or filament which are light weight and strong. The bullet proof jackets have two layers. The upper layer is ceramic and the inner most layer is made of ballistic material.When a bullet strikes the jacket, the ceramic layer breaks the pointed head which releases energy. This energy us absorbed by the ballistic layer keeping the soldiers safe.The industrialists Hindustan spoke to, said American and European companies are reliable when it comes to makign such important life-saving jackets and even helmets.“We don’t trust China, especially in a sensitive sector like defence. Therefore, we buy the raw material to make these bulleto proof jackets from Denmark and American companies,” said Mayank Shrivastava, MD, NCFD.India lost 20 of its army personnel, including a colonel, in the violent face-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the biggest confrontation between the militaries of India and China in more than four decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-firms-making-bullet-proof-jackets-ditch-china-say-no-trust-report/story-xrT1gpXmsH6cAiglt55KCM.html

26-06-2020||India||Petition in Supreme Court challenges Kerala ban on animal sacrifice in temples||A petition was filed before the Supreme Court on Thursday challenging a Kerala law which prohibits animal sacrifice for appeasement of deity in temples and temple precincts.The petitioners, who are followers of Shakthi worshipping tradition, claimed that appeasing deity through animal sacrifice is an essential religious practice mandated by religious texts and scriptures followed by them and should, therefore, be permitted.“In Shakthi worship as per its scriptures and practices popularly known as “pramanas”, animal sacrifice is essential and unavoidable for the propitiation of the deity”, the petition filed through advocate A Karthik stated.The law in question, Kerala Animals and Bird Sacrifices Prohibition Act, 1968 (Act), therefore, violates the right to equality guaranteed by Article 14 and the right to practice religion and manage religious affairs under articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution, it was submitted.The Act was earlier challenged before the Kerala high court, which on June 16 dismissed the plea. The Act imposes ban on sacrifice of animals and birds in temples for propitiation of deity and criminalises the same. Violation of the law attracts jail term of upto 3 months and fine of Rs. 300.A similar case from Tripura concerning validity of animal sacrifice in temples is already pending before the apex court.The petitioners claimed that the Act violates right to equality because identical practices by other religious communities are not prohibited by the Act.Further, it was also contended that the Act only penalises killing of animals for propitiation of deity and animal or bird sacrifice for all other purposes including personal consumption within temple precincts is not prohibited.“If the object of the law were to ensure preservation and protection of animals, it would demand its uniform application across all religious communities”, the petition stated.The petitioners also submitted that the law enacted by the central government to prevent cruelty to animals, Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960 specifically permits sacrificing animals as ritual in Hindu temples throughout India.“Kerala Animals and Birds Sacrifices Prohibition Act, 1968 is repugnant to the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 insofar as the Act operates in the same entry and criminalises an act which the Union Legislation chooses explicitly not to criminalise”, the plea added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petition-in-supreme-court-challenges-kerala-ban-on-animal-sacrifice-in-temples/story-9DYDEHJqyBfrrpQo6LC54J.html

My duty is not to propagate the government propaganda. Uttar Pradesh government is wasting its time in trying to threaten me. Take whatever action you want to, I will keep highlighting the truth.

She had also said that the Agra model propagated by the Uttar Pradesh government stands exposed. The Congress leader had attached a news report in her tweet.Taking cognizance of the tweet, Agra District Magistrate Prabhu Narain Singh on Tuesday asked the Congress general secretary to withdraw the tweet.But undeterred, Gandhi attacked the Uttar Pradesh government on the same day over the “high” Covid-19 mortality rate in Agra. She said on Twitter that chief minister Yogi Adityanath should clarify within 48 hours who was responsible for “pushing people into these adverse circumstances”.Tagging a media report, she had said the Covid-19 death rate in Agra was 6.8 per cent, which was higher than Delhi and Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/take-whatever-action-you-want-to-priyanka-gandhi-dares-up-govt-over-covid-19-tweets/story-TsvHMTx4vEvcorPa35UnTO.html

Who sat on the PMNRF board? Smt. Sonia Gandhi. Who chairs RGF? Smt. Sonia Gandhi. Totally reprehensible, disregarding ethics, processes and not bothering about transparency,” he tweeted on Friday. PMNRF, meant to help people in distress, was donating money to Rajiv Gandhi Foundation in UPA years.

Totally reprehensible, disregarding ethics, processes and not bothering about transparency. pic.twitter.com/tttDP4S6bYHe also attached a list of donors to Rajiv Gandhi Foundation in from years 2005 to 2008 along with his tweets.“People of India donated their hard-earned money to PMNRF to help their fellow citizens in need. To divert this public money into a family run foundation is not only a brazen fraud but also a big betrayal of the people of India,” the BJP chief further said in his subsequent tweet.“One family’s hunger for wealth has cost the nation immensely. If only they have devoted their energies towards more constructive agenda. The Congress’ Imperial Dynasty needs to apologise to the unchecked loot for self-gains!” Nadda said sharpening his attack. One family’s hunger for wealth has cost the nation immensely. If only they have devoted their energies towards more constructive agenda. The Congress’ Imperial Dynasty needs to apologise to the unchecked loot for self-gains!The BJP chief has been targeting the Congress party since its attack on the government, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after the face-off between the Indian and Chinese soldiers in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15.The Congress, and its former chief Rahul Gandhi, has accused the Centre of giving away India’s territory to the Chinese even after a statement by PM Modi at the all-party meeting that there is no presence of the Chinese in the Indian territory and not an inch of country’s land has been taken.Sonia Gandho had said that the current crisis is a result of the “mismanagement” of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government and the “wrong policies” pursued by it.“True to its character, the government is in denial. The intrusion was detected and reported on May 5. Instead of a resolution, the situation deteriorated rapidly and there were violent clashes on June 15-16. Twenty Indian soldiers were martyred, 85 injured and 10 went ‘missing’ until they were returned,” she said at the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Tuesday.Former prime minister Dr Manmohan Singh said that PM Modi should be always mindful of the implications of his words, a reference to the controversy stoked by Prime Minister Modi’s comments at the all-party meeting on Friday. Dr Singh also said that the government must rise to the occasion to ensure justice for Colonel B Santhosh Babu and other jawans who were killed in action.It was then that Nadda launched a tweetstorm, saying the Congress party should stop insulting the security forces repeatedly and questioning their valour.In a series of tweets, Nadda lashed out at Congress and said it is the Opposition right to ask questions and the all-party meeting with the Prime Minister last week saw healthy deliberations with several opposition leaders giving their valuable inputs. Nadda said they also fully supported the Centre in determining the way ahead. “One family was an exception. Any guesses who?” he tweeted without naming names. A petition has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking investigation in a memorandum of understanding (MoU) entered into between the Congress party and the Communist Party of China in 2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-chief-jp-nadda-sharpens-attack-on-congress-questions-sonia-gandhi-over-transparency/story-XCNdaPrPM9zLKWHR4SmpuJ.html

26-06-2020||India||Fuel prices increase for 20th day, petrol crosses Rs 80 a litre mark in Delhi||The prices of petrol and diesel continued their upward trend for 20th day in a row. On Friday, the petrol was retailing at Rs 80.13 a litre in Delhi and diesel price was Rs 80.19 a litre.This was an increase of 21 paise in the price of petrol and 17 paise a litre in diesel price.Except for Wednesday, the petrol price has also gone up across the country since June 7, when the daily revision of prices started after a gap of 82 days due to Covid-19.Diesel prices in Delhi had shot past petrol prices on Wednesday for the first time ever.Chairman of state-run Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Sanjiv Singh, had said on Thursday that higher diesel price in Delhi was a result of a steep hike in Value Added Tax or VAT by the state government.He said VAT is lower in other cities which has meant diesel remains cheaper than petrol. “The Delhi government had increased VAT on petrol from 27 per cent to 30 per cent and that on diesel from 16.75 per cent to 30 per cent on May 5,” said Singh.State-owned fuel firms benchmark retail rates to Arab-Gulf international oil prices and a formula decides them, the IOC chairman said, adding that demand dropped drastically in the aftermath of lockdowns imposed across the globe to curb spread of coronavirus, sending oil prices plunging to multi-year low.This included oil futures falling below zero on one day in US trading. Reducing prices in line with that fall was not “sustainable” as cracks - the difference between crude oil (raw material) and petroleum product (finished goods) prices - were running negative, he said.The Opposition has been relentlessly attacking the government over the fuel price hike. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi said on Thursday that it has become clear that the Centre is only interested in picking pockets of the people even in times of crisis.The Congress will hold mass protests across the country on Monday over the “unprecedented” rise in petrol and diesel prices.Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leaders Tejashwi Yadav and Tej Pratap Yadav along with party workers held a cycle march protest against rising fuel prices in Patna on Thursday.National Congress Party (NCP) leader Supriya Sule urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday to reduce the rates to provide relief to the common man.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fuel-prices-increase-for-20th-day-petrol-crosses-rs-80-a-litre-mark-in-delhi/story-9TiI6xhOJeBYUDGTjgXzBO.html

The 1993 agreement signed during Narasimha Rao-Jiang Zemin era makes it amply clear that the military forces have to be kept to a “minimum level” along the LAC.Also Read: China’s dragon act on LAC to be decoded by General Naravane in high-level meet todayThe Indian statement on Thursday carries a sting in the very last line by conveying that all gains made in the bilateral relationship in the past three decades will be lost if China does not de-escalate and disengage the PLA forces from the LAC. “India is quite capable of handling the military to military posture on the LAC but the entire economic relationship will go for a toss if PLA does not de-escalate. It cannot be business as usual for China if this situation continues. It is this call that General Secretary Xi Jinping has to take,” said a senior official. Also Watch | ‘Ban Chinese companies from India’s 5G trial’: Former envoy to ChinaEven though there has not been any military flying by the Chinese Air Force in the past three days, PLA has amassed troops all along the LAC with artillery and missile support. Its posture along the 1,597 km LAC in Ladakh is threatening with troops ready for the red flag to go up. Its military air bases at Kashgar, Hotan, Yarkand, Korla and Gor Gunsa are battle ready.However, the PLA is rather unhappy at the change of military attitude showed by the 16 Bihar Indian Army unit at the June 15 Galwan flare-up and the Indian posture at Daulet Beg Oldi. With the Darbuk-Shyok-DBO road complete, India has made game changing military posture near the Karakoram pass with the deployment of T-90 tanks, Russian BMP amphibious infantry fighting vehicles and American M-777 155mm howitzers.Also Read: At 4-hr long India-China border talks, focus on de-escalation and disengagementWith the Indian deployment of state-of-the-art weaponry at the highest DBO post and all advance landing grounds, including Nyoma active, the PLA will suffer heavy casualties in case it tries to bully across the LAC.The DSDBO road has been the turning point for India as the strategic axis had put paid to all Chinese plans to occupy Ladakh by linking up to Siachen Glacier and virtually make Indian defences untenable in Kashmir. Had the Indian governments in the past agreed to so-called peaceniks who wanted Indian Army to demilitarize Siachen or turn it into a park, the Chinese plan would have become a reality.While the Chinese posture on LAC continues to be aggressive, the clock is ticking on the bilateral relationship as India has made up its mind that it will slam the economic door on Beijing if dis-engagement does not take place within weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-aggressive-posturing-along-lac-china-turning-bilateral-relationship-back-to-1990s-says-india/story-xN6qbIbdxxYDOWirAuRoKJ.html

26-06-2020||India||Heavy rainfall, thunderstorm warnings for 8 Bihar districts||The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast heavy rainfall, thunderstorm and lightning on Friday in at least eight districts of Bihar, where more than 80 people were killed in several parts of the state on Thursday.Siwan, Gopalganj, Sitamarhi, Darbhanga, Supaul, Araria, Kishanganj and Katihar will receive heavy rainfall along with thunderstorm, lightning and squalls on Friday, according to the weather bureau.East Champaran, West Champaran, Gopalgunj, Siwan, Saran, Sitamarhi, Madhubani, Darbhanga, Kishanganj, Katihar, Madhepura, Purnia, Saharsa and Araria will continue to receive heavy rainfall on Saturday.IMD had said earlier that a situation conducive for enhancing rainfall activities is likely to prevail over the foothills of the Himalayas along with Bihar-Nepal border and adjoining areas.Eighty-three people were killed and 30 others injured in the thunderstorm and lightning on Thursday.The Nitish Kumar-led government in the state asked people to adhere to safety norms during bad weather conditions and follow guidelines issued from time to time by the disaster management department.The chief minister secretariat said financial help to those who lost animals and cattle was also being extended.The maximum number of people, 13, died in Gopalganj, eight each lost their lives in Madhubani and Nawada, six each in Siwan and Bhagalpur, five each in East Champaran, Darbhanga, and Banka, three each in Khagaria and Aurangabad, two each in West Champaran, Kishanganj, Jehanabad, Jamui, Purnia, Supaul, Buxar and Kaimur and one each in Samastipur, Sheohar, Saran, Sitamarhi and Madhepura.Reports from Gopalganj said all the victims were farmers from Barauli, Manjha, Vijaipur, Uchkagaon and Kateya areas. The lightning struck them when they were working in their fields.In Khagaria, a woman died and five minors were injured in Choutham locality. More than 15 cattle deaths were also reported.In Darbhanga, which saw five deaths, Pushpesh Kumar, in charge of disaster management, said the fatalities included a woman from Uchhati village who was planting paddy in the field when the lightning struck.Reports from Madhubani said that eight people, including four of a family, besides a farmer and two others, were killed in Phulparas and Benipatti police stations areas.In East Champaran district, a 49-year-old man died and three others were injured at Belwatiya village under Sagauli police station. A 14-year-old girl from Surendra village under Raxaul police station was also killed in the lightning.“Three others injured are undergoing treatment at the local hospital in Sagauli and the body of the deceased has been sent to Motihari Sadar Hospital for autopsy,” Mithilesh Kumar, station house officer of Sagauli police station, said.In neighbouring West Champaran, two villagers were killed in Narkatiaganj.“Widespread rain after a gap causes more thunderstorm and lightning activity. Since it’s a favourable time of crop sowing, more people are out in the fields and they are the most vulnerable to a lightning strike,” Anand Shankar, a weather scientist at Patna IMD centre, said.He said that a similar incident took place in April this year but since people stayed indoors, the damage was less.“MeT has mobile apps like Damini and IndarVajr, which give an early alert of thunderstorm and lightning. People are advised to use this app and stay alert during monsoon,” he said.Last year, lightning had killed 39 people in Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imd-issues-heavy-rainfall-warning-for-8-bihar-districts/story-LUlFbf11hHKqhxXhyw34xL.html

26-06-2020||India||Delhiwale: A teacher expresses her gratitude||It was just another Monday morning for the English teacher in the new normal. Vasudha Dixit, 39, settled down at her desk in the bedroom by 8.15am. She first ran through the school emails. Then she logged onto Microsoft Teams—a software platform used by her school to hold online classes—and quickly browsed through the assignments that her students had sent her. She started her first class of the day at 8.30am with about 23 students (though she can see only nine students at any given time on her laptop screen). She was done with work by 2pm. It was time for lunch.Later in the day, after helping her son, a seventh standard student, with his Hindi homework, Ms Dixit returned to her laptop. Her mind was full of feelings about the unusual texture of life these days. In the next 20 minutes, she wrote a poem.“Life has been very different since March this year,” she confesses, chatting on WhatsApp video. Fond of the poetry of Robert Frost, William Wordsworth and Makhanlal Chaturvedi, Ms Dixit teaches English and EVS (Environmental Studies) to grade II students at a private school in Faridabad. The coronavirus pandemic turned the world upside down for her, her colleagues and her students. The classes are held virtually, which means Ms Dixit no longer has to step out of the pleasant house she shares with her parents and her young son, in south Delhi’s Gulmohar Park.“But I miss those daily interactions in the school,” she argues. She also misses going to movies with her son. It was in February that she last went out with Siddharth to a multiplex in Saket, after which they had pancakes and omelettes filled with bacon and cheese. “I wish I could catch up with my friends in person. However, I am grateful that the lockdown and its aftermath has given me a chance to spend time with family and to keenly observe the daily life of nature.”Ms Dixit shares her poem with us.A TEACHER IN LOCKDOWNIt was in March when it dawned on us that life had to come to a standstill…In a hurry we said our byes, knowing little about the uncertainty that would spill…The school was shut, for we had to adopt social distancing.Stepping out was a big no, we had to learn how to be still.The trees sprouted new leaves, the weather was fair.I started observing the flowers, the butterflies… sighting a plane was rare.I greeted the many birds on the trees around my house, I realised their beauty!The Neem had flowers that intoxicated the senses, even as the Dahlias and Lilies brightened up my spaces.Evenings on the terrace were magical… Venus shone bright even as the Moon completed its cycle!We didn’t let adversity deter us…adapting to technology was the way forward.It was time to meet our students virtually! To start learning and studying remotely!The Sun shines brighter now, the hot loo has made an appearance!The Neem tree has started bearing fruits, while Amaltas brightens up the park!My balcony is full of fragrances…Champa, Roses, Jasmine… it is a heady mix.Even as I go about my daily chores, the rains have now knocked at our doors!I am still at home…with the hope that I would return to the way life was before!However, full of gratitude that I got a chance to see all this and more!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-a-teacher-expresses-her-gratitude/story-IjrDQ7xyJ7r2dLMWcScQOL.html
26-06-2020||India||Assam gas field may have flouted green guidelines||Oil India Limited (OIL)’s gas well number 5 at Baghjan in Assam’s Tinsukia, where a blowout on May 27 triggered a continuing oil and gas leakage near the Maguri Motapung Wetland and Dibru Saikhowa Biosphere Reserve, was not assessed for its wildlife and biodiversity impact, according to Union environment ministry’s documents.No wildlife clearance was obtained for wells in the region including well number 5, which is located barely a kilometre away from the Dibru Saikhowa National Park. The wildlife and biodiversity impact of the wells were not studied for nearly a decade since the ministry granted them environmental clearance. Two environmental clearances were issued to OIL in 2011 years after it was granted the Baghjan petroleum mining lease in 2003. One related to the drilling of six exploratory wells in Tinsukia’s Mechaki area. The second clearance allowed drilling of 41 development and exploratory wells in north Hapjan, Tinsukia and Dhola. Also read | Assam gas well blowout threat to tea industry: TAIThe first environmental clearance letter dated November 2, 2011, seen by HT, was issued on the condition that no other wells apart from the six will be drilled. The other letter dated November 1, 2011, was meant for 41 wells located outside a 10 km radius of any national park, wildlife sanctuary or eco-sensitive area. The letters also stipulated conditions like installation of blowout preventers and an oil spillage and mitigation plan.“The first 5 to 6 wells were drilled in 2003-2004 when even the Environment Impact Assessment notification, 2006, was not applicable. We started applying for some permissions after regulations were drafted and were granted ECs [environmental clearances] in 2011,” said OIL spokesperson Tridiv Hazarika.Baghjan is located at the confluence of the Siang, Dibang and Lohit rivers and is among the few remaining habitats for several endangered and range-restricted species. The blowout led to the uncontrollable flow of oil from gas well number 5 and caused extensive damage to biodiversity and wildlife the region, which includes endangered hoolock gibbons and the Gangetic dolphins.There are 17 oil and five gas wells in the Baghjan oil field. The field is located only 500 metres from the Maguri-Motapung wetland, which is a part of the eco-sensitive zone of Dibru Saikhowa National Park.In a December 2006 ruling, the Supreme Court said all development or mining projects within a 10 km radius of a national park will require National Board for Wildlife’s (NBWL) clearance and assessment. This judgement was ignored in case of Baghjan wells until the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) was declared for Dibru Saikhowa National Park, carefully excluding the wells. The ESZ was notified in January and extends up to 8.7 km from the park. “Gas wells in the Baghjan block are located outside notified ESZ of Dibru Saikhowa National Park….,” the environment ministry said in response to HT’s queries onwhy the wildlife impact was not considered.Mridupaban Phukon, a wildlife activist, said environmentalists have been demanding that the environmental and wildlife clearance granted to OIL gas wells in Baghjan be placed in the public domain. “We had also written to the Assam Pollution Control Board about this but have not received any response. We have doubts about whether all the wells have EC [environmental clearance]. How could the government allow such projects in an ecologically sensitive area without adequate checks?” Phukon asked.“The area is seismically very active. I wonder if seismicity of the area was assessed. It also happens to be very close to a river and a national park. Any industrial activity of this scale would have an impact on both the river and forests. The landscape is a unique landscape of lowland forests. It is possibly one of its kind left in India. So all precautionary measures should have been taken,” said Qamar Qureshi, senior scientist at Wildlife Institute of India who along with his team is studying the impact of the oil spill and gas blowout on the region’s ecology.Also read | Closure notice to Assam gas field over blowoutOIL insisted it had executed a disaster management plan immediately after the blowout. “For blowouts like this, evacuation of local populace to a safe place is the first priority. Water jacketing of the gas coming out by fire tender is also a priority... BOP [blowout preventer] is a standard safety device used in all our operations,” OIL said in response to HT’s questions.Experts said cumulative impact of drilling in an ecologically fragile area was never assessed because OIL sought clearances in a piecemeal manner.“The regulatory trajectory of OIL’s operations leaves several questions unanswered. The need for comprehensive wildlife approval back in 2011, exemptions from public hearings, a pipeline constructed without all approvals, compliance of environmental safeguards will all need to be examined while investigating the reasons that led to the leak and fire causing the insurmountable ecological and humanitarian impacts,” said Kanchi Kohli, a legal researcher at New Delhi’s Centre for Policy Research. Kohli added that in effect, gas exploration, extraction and transportation have been dealt with in a piecemeal manner and has been allowed to inch closer and closer to the national park.FAIT ACCOMPLI OIL applied for an NBWL clearance in 2012 for the transfer of 114.267 ha of non-forest land falling within 10 km radius of the national park for laying of a crude oil pipeline beneath the wetland and another 304.15 ha for expansion of gas field development.NBWL deputed its members Prerna Singh Bindra and MD Madhusudan for a site inspection after residents and non-governmental organisations accused OIL of violations. Their report highlighted that OIL had started pipeline construction even before it got approval from NBWL.“We strongly disapprove of the current trend of presenting the NBWL with fait accompli situations and seeking post-facto clearances for projects on which work has already been undertaken without the requisite prior permissions. The expenditure thus incurred, in this case, from the public exchequer puts undue and unfair pressure on the NBWL to ratify violations of wildlife and environmental norms,” the report said.The report recommended that OIL provide a legal undertaking about its environmental safeguards and specify the nature and extent of their liability in case of accidents involving oil spillage or gas leakage into the wetland.The expert appraisal committee (EAC) of the environment ministry in meetings on December 30, 31, 2019 and January 1, 2020 recommended environmental clearance for drilling and testing of hydrocarbons at seven locations inside and under the national park.According to the minutes of the EAC meetings, seen by HT, OIL had sought exemption from public hearings multiple times. The EAC agreed to exempt the project from public hearing but the environment ministry did not accept it.EAC wrote to OIL on May 29, 2019 about resubmitting the proposal after conducting a fresh public hearing. A public hearing is mandatory for a project of this nature.But according to the minutes, OIL again requested exemption from the public hearing, saying it had conducted one in Tinsukia in 2016. OIL submitted that there was widespread local opposition to drilling inside the park.“It was informed that conducting a public hearing in the area is a big challenge and couldn’t be completed at times due to unruly acts by the local pressure groups. Due to vulnerability and blockade from local pressure groups production in these areas has been stopped,” according the minutes seen by HT.The EAC cleared the project considering its “national importance” for energy security. The minutes say that every drop of oil production would significantly contribute towards meeting the vision of reducing oil imports by 10% by 2022.Drilling of seven wells was expected to contribute 700,000 litres of oil daily and save Rs 450 crore annually spent on crude oil imports.A Supreme Court judgement of April 2014 restricted any mining within a kilometre boundary of a protected area.OIL filed a petition in 2015 saying it be exempted from the Supreme Court order because it pertained to the mining of minerals and not to drilling of oil wells.OIL managed to get both the court and NBWL clearance on August 9, 2017.Manju Menon, a senior fellow at Centre for Policy Research, who has been tracking this case, cited papers available and said it appears that OIL dodged the public hearing procedures for its expansion. “If a project that has been around for years cannot hold a public hearing, how do regulatory bodies that grant approval to such a project expect it to operate successfully in the midst of local communities? This expectation is totally misplaced when all they have done is to create conditions for conflict.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-gas-field-may-have-flouted-green-guidelines/story-uhmEbSU6w7NUSCqdJmpVLJ.html
26-06-2020||India||App launched for easy access to blood||Union health minister Harsh Vardhan Thursday launched the ‘ebloodservices’ app, in partnership with the Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS), to ease access to blood for those who need transfusions.“This is like placing a request for blood right at your doorstep. I received several complaints over the past few months from people on lack of access to safe blood, especially from those people who need regular blood donation owing to their chronic blood disorders. It will be beneficially in these corona times when commuting has become a problem, and those who need blood may not be able to go from one blood bank to another,” Vardhan said.“This app shall bring transparency in the blood donation programme and minimise the worries of those in dire need of blood. Our blood donors should come forward in large numbers as their contribution is required more than ever now,” he added.To start with, the app will cater to all of Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), and a user can place an order for up to four units in one go.“Through this app, the availability of blood will be visible right in your phone. Once an order has been placed then the blood bank will keep the request active for 12 hours. The order will be diverted to the next patient only after the original recipient fails to collect it within 12 hours,” said RK Jain, secretary general, Indian Red Cross Society.The app’s scope will be expanded, with plans of linking more blood banks to it and also in other cities. “This is a useful app and there are plans of expanding its reach,” Vardhan said.Jain said that initial few weeks could be challenging for the proper functioning of the app. “We are expecting to face glitches initially for at least 15 days to about a month as we do not know the exact demand of blood in the region as of now. It will take some time before we know how much blood is needed and act accordingly,” said Jain.The Red Cross blood bank had started conducting blood donation camps by sending mobile blood collection units to various localities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/app-launched-for-easy-access-to-blood/story-vKhgaTOgFDuLrrDMv3QQGO.html

HUL’s move comes as more brands are being prompted to market products that are more “inclusive” as opposed to perpetuating social stereotypes and elevating long-held ideals of beauty—that in a market like India is often equated with fairness. “...The new name is awaiting regulatory approvals, and the pack with the revised name will be available in the market in the next few months,” the company said in a statement on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/skin-whitening-cream-fair-lovely-decides-to-drop-fair-from-its-name/story-U3CZl8Y3u7dSCdMdQAvX5K.html
26-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Some high-frequency economic indicators — those released more often than a quarter, perhaps every month, even week — could see a sharp rise in June. The lockdown imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease officially ended on May 31, after 68 days, and we are in a phase (till June 30), that the government calls Unlock 1.0. The Prime Minister himself referred to some of these indicators last week.Nomura’s latest India Business Resumption Index, for the week ended June 21, says that almost 70% of business activity in the country has resumed (the base is February). And CMIE data shows that the unemployment rate for the same week was 8.5%, near pre-lockdown levels, and far off the peaks seen in April and May. Sure, urban unemployment is still, at 11.2%, a couple of percentage points higher than the levels before the lockdown, but rural unemployment, at 7.26%, was actually around a percentage point lower than what it was pre-lockdown. That isn’t surprising — the rural job guarantee scheme is in full swing, and sowing activity this year (for the summer or monsoon crop or Kharif) is higher than what it was in 2019. Hindustan Times has been reporting for weeks now that agriculture could be the one (and only) bright spot in the economy this year.REVISING OUTLOOK IMF now expects the Indian economy to shrink by 4.5% in 2020-21. It also predicts that the global economy will contract by 4.9% in 2020. With the pandemic continuing to rage across the world and a cure some distance away, it’s entirely possible that IMF may have to revise these numbers again.Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund has revised its growth estimates for India. It now expects the country’s economy to shrink by 4.5% in 2020-21, a revision (and also a change in direction) from its previous rosy estimate of 1.9% growth. It also revised its estimate for the following year, 2021-22, from 7.4% to a much more moderate 6%. IMF also predicts that the global economy will contract by 4.9% in 2020 (its previous estimate was a 3% contraction).Also read | The government imposed a flawed lockdown. It has caused immense sufferingWith the first wave of infections continuing to rage across the world, and the number of cases expected to cross 10 million soon (and the number of deaths half a million), and a cure some distance away, it’s entirely possible that IMF may have to revise these numbers again.SLOW RECOVERY The pent-up demand from the 68-day lockdown will soon burn itself out, and in the absence of measures to boost aggregate demand, and a cure for the coronavirus disease this year, the Indian economy’s revival is going to be slow — and painful.The IMF forecast is broadly in line with what most economists have been predicting for India, a contraction of anything between 3% and 5%. Agriculture, many admit, may help cushion the fall, but it will still be a hard landing.It’s a hardness that may not be evident in the numbers. Assuming IMF’s numbers for 2020-21 and 2021-22 prove accurate, the Indian economy, at the end of 2021-22 would be marginally larger than what it was at the end of 2019-20. In effect, it would have lost just a year.A HARD LANDING LIKELYIMF’s forecast is broadly in line with what most economists have been predicting for India, a contraction of anything between 3% and 5%. If IMF’s projections are accurate, the Indian economy in FY22 would only be marginally larger than what it was in 2019-20.Over the past few weeks, I have spoken to a lot of smart people — bankers, venture capitalists, chief executives, economists, start-up founders, even a few people who run small businesses — and the general consensus seems to be that, including the opportunity cost, we have lost at least a decade.Small businesses (and small businessmen) have been hit the hardest; many have gone out of business. At least some start-ups are in shutdown mode. Many large companies are dealing with a sharp dip in business (and revenue). Salaries have been cut; people have been laid off; and there is a lot of pain everywhere. Sure, business activity has resumed, but many of the high-frequency indicators flashing green may be doing so because of pent-up demand (from the 68-day-long lockdown when no one bought anything other than the bare necessities).Also read | Masks, bleach: Europe’s cities gear up for post-coronavirus lockdown tourismThe Covid-19 pandemic, and the lockdown, hit India at a point when the country was already vulnerable — its economic growth was steadily declining at the time, plagued by both structural and cyclical issues and showing a decline in both investment and consumption. Some of those structural factors may have been addressed by the policy changes announced as part of India’s Rs 20-lakh-crore stimulus package (of which just around a tenth is a direct fiscal stimulus), but some have not. The pent-up demand will soon burn itself out, and in the absence of measures to boost aggregate demand, and a cure for the coronavirus disease this year, the Indian economy’s revival is going to be slow — and painful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-oJO3I3gJagRGNXzXoaSsfO.html

26-06-2020||India||LAC standoff: Hope India meets China halfway, says Chinese ambassador||Reaching out to New Delhi after raising tensions in eastern Ladakh to a fever pitch, China on Thursday said it was ready to work with India to properly deal with the military standoff, and asked it to meet the halfway, asserting that “suspicion and friction” was a wrong path that goes against the fundamental aspirations of people of the two countries.In an interview to PTI, Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidong said India and China are able to properly manage their differences, but at the same time put the onus on New Delhi to ease the tension, and called upon it to avoid taking actions that may “complicate” the situation in eastern Ladakh.“We hope the Indian side meets the Chinese side halfway, avoids taking actions that may complicate the border situation and takes concrete actions to maintain stability in the border areas,” he said and went on to add that at present, the overall situation in the China-India border areas is “stable and controllable.” The Indian and Chinese armies are locked in a bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for the last six weeks, and the tension escalated manifold after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash in Galwan Valley on June 15. The Chinese ambassador said “mutual respect and support” is a sure way and meets the long-term interests of both countries, but asserted that the onus was not on China to ease tensions in the region. “China and India are both large developing countries and emerging economies with more than one billion people, and both have the historic mission of realising our own development and revitalisation,” he said. “The onus is not on China. The Indian side crossed the LAC (Line of Actual Control) for provocation and attacked the Chinese border troops. The Indian forces seriously violated agreements on border issues between the two countries,” he said.In the course of the interview, Sun repeated the Chinese government’s stand -- which has been rejected by India -- that Indian troops are responsible for the Galwan Valley clashes, and indicated that the onus was on India to improve the situation in eastern Ladakh. At a weekly media briefing, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava held China directly responsible for the border standoff saying it has been has been amassing a large contingent of troops and armaments along the LAC since early May and conduct of the Chinese forces has been in complete disregard of all mutually agreed norms.Srivastava also said the deployment of large body of troops and changes in behavior has also been aggravated by “unjustified and untenable claims” including over the Galwan Valley.Emphasising that the path of “suspicion and friction” was wrong and goes against the fundamental aspiration of the two peoples, the ambassador said,”China and India are willing and able to properly manage differences.” In the last few weeks, both sides have held a series of diplomatic and military talks to cool down temperature even as Chinese military has increased its presence in all sensitive areas along the 3,500 km Line of Actual Control (LAC), the de-facto border. Under the guidance of the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, “we are ready to work with the Indian side to properly deal with the current situation, jointly uphold peace and stability in the border areas, and ensure a sound and steady development of bilateral relations.” In their informal summit in Chinese city of Wuhan in 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping underscored the importance of maintaining peace and tranquillity in all areas of the India-China border region in the interest of the development of bilateral relations. The summit had taken place months after a 73-day military face-off between the two armies in Doklam that raised fears of a war between the two Asian giants. After the killing of 20 Indian soldiers in Galwan clashes, India called it “a premeditated and planned action by China” and sent a veiled warning to China saying “India wants peace but if provoked, India is capable of giving a befitting reply”. Referring to talks between foreign ministers of the two countries on June 17, the envoy said both sides agreed to “fairly address” the serious situation caused by the Galwan conflict and vowed to jointly follow the consensus reached at the commander-level meeting on June 6 to ease the situation as soon as possible. Sun said China would not like to see a similar situation like the Galwan clashes, but repeated Chinese foreign ministry’s allegations that India was responsible for it. The Ambassador said the two sides kept peace for decades in Galwan Valley, but alleged that since the beginning of 2020, the Indian side has built facilities at or the crossing of the LAC in the Galwan Valley, thereby “constantly changing the status quo of ground control. On May 6, he claimed the Indian troops crossed the LAC in the Galwan Valley by night and trespassed into Chinese territory. “They resorted to violent means to create a standoff between the two sides and built infrastructures in an attempt to maintain a permanent presence,” he alleged. In his briefing, Srivastava said Indian troops have been patrolling the Galwan Valley for a long time and all infrastructure built by the Indian side has always been on its side of the LAC.Sun said Chinese side lodged representations on multiple occasions to the Indian side through military and diplomatic channels following the incident and that India agreed to withdraw its personnel from the area. The two sides held Lt General-level talks on June 6 during which they agreed on disengagement of troops from all the standoff areas. The ambassador said the Indian side promised in the talks that they would not cross the estuary of the Galwan river to patrol and build facilities, adding the two sides agreed to build observation posts on either side of the Galwan river mouth. “However, after the commander-level meeting, when the situation on the ground was already easing, the Indian border troops copped out on the consensus reached at the commander-level meeting, demanded that China dismantle its observation post,” he alleged. India has been consistently maintaining that Galwan Valley clashes had taken place on the Indian side of the LAC. The envoy also said actions taken by the Indian side are not in consonance with the spirit of several agreements signed by the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lac-standoff-hope-india-meets-china-halfway-says-chinese-ambassador/story-qqSpOKMGxKqur8S39GwzXO.html

26-06-2020||India||Space activities bill must come into force, says ISRO chief||Private players can start participating in certain space-sector activities now with the formation of Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) being approved, but the Space Activities Bill will have to come into force for them to start launching missions, said ISRO chairperson Dr K Sivan, in an interview to Hindustan Times.He said that an assessment of the impact of Covid-19 would be possible only after the situation returns to normal. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) had planned several big-ticket missions for the year — India’s first solar mission Aditya L1 in the first half of 2020, another lander-rover mission between November 2020 and the first half of 2021, and the first unmanned mission in December 2020, in preparation for a final manned mission, ahead of the PM’s deadline of Independence Day 2022. Edited excerpts:How will the newly constituted body, IN-SPACe, function?There are various verticals of the department of space, such as the ISRO, the autonomous bodies and the PSUs (Public Sector Undertakings). Now, IN-SPACe will be another vertical under the department that will enable private players to carry out space activities. To do so, definitely some systems, like appropriate policies, are required. The Space Activities Bill should comprise this.We are already working on it — we are trying to modify some existing policies to suit the entry of private players. Also, the frameworks have to be defined.Also read | Govt ‘unlocks’ space sector, says will promote and guide private playersCan the body function independently in the absence of the Bill?Some of the activities can be started without the Bill. By then, the Bill will also come in and the picture will come together. But for space launched by the private sector, yes, the Bill would be required.How has the Covid-19 pandemic affected the missions of ISRO?The outbreak has definitely impacted our activities, which are mostly dependent on the 500 industries spread across the country. The lockdown has had an impact on that and thereby our, missions. But, we can make an assessment only after the situation becomes normal. In the meantime, some of our centres were producing sanitisers and working on creating ventilator systems. Geo-fencing and mapping were also taking place, using space services.Also read | Private players can build and launch space missions, says ISRO chiefWhat about the big-ticket missions like Chandrayaan-3 and Gaganyaan?We are working on these missions, but as I said, we will only be able to say after an assessment, once the situation becomes normal.

26-06-2020||India||Pakistan trying to obtain nuke tech illegally: Germany||New DelhiPakistan and North Korea continue to be involved in efforts to illegally obtain nuclear products and know-how from German hi-tech companies as part of efforts to development their atomic weapons programmes, a new report by German authorities has said.The annual report from the Office for the Protection of the Constitution in Baden-Württemberg, a state in southwest Germany, said the country is an “important area of operation” for clandestine efforts by Pakistan, North Korea, Iran and Syria to obtain nuclear technology as it is a leading industrial nation and home to numerous hi-tech firms.The report for the year 2019 was made public by authorities in Baden-Württemberg on June 16. This is the second time in less than six months that German authorities have expressed concern about Pakistan’s efforts to illegally procure technology used in atomic weapons.The report, which is in German, said: “Iran, Pakistan, North Korea and Syria are still pursuing such efforts. They aim to complete existing arsenals, perfect the range, deployability and effectiveness of their weapons, and develop new weapons systems. They are trying to obtain the necessary products and relevant know-how...through illegal procurement efforts in Germany.”Such countries also “constantly develop and optimise their procurement methods” to circumvent existing export restrictions and embargoes, the report said.“To conceal the actual end user, they can procure goods in Germany and Europe with the help of specially established cover companies and, in particular, transport dual-use goods to risk states. Typical bypass countries include the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and China,” the report added.Potential sources of nuclear know-how are universities, non-university research institutions and research and training departments of companies, the report said.“In order to minimise risks, the State Office for the Protection of the Constitution sensitises those responsible to make them aware of the danger and possible consequences of illegal knowledge transfer,” it added.In a specific section on Pakistan, the report said the country has operated an extensive programme for nuclear weapons and delivery systems for many years. “This is primarily directed against the ‘arch enemy’ India, which also possesses nuclear weapons. For maintenance and further development, Pakistan is dependent, among other things, on the acquisition of Western technology and procedures,” the report said.“In addition to the acquisition of products (dual-use goods), the secondment of scientists to universities, institutes or research establishments is also important. This also applies to institutions in Baden-Württemberg.”In November last year, the German government had responded to a question from several lawmakers of die Linke (Left Party) by saying it believed there has been a “sharp increase” in Pakistan’s activities in recent years to illegally procure technology used in nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) weapons.The government’s reply dovetailed with concerns expressed by Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV), the domestic intelligence service, which had said in a 2018 report on proliferation-related matters that there has been a “massive increase” in Pakistan’s attempts to clandestinely procure nuclear goods in Germany and other Western countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-trying-to-obtain-nuke-tech-illegally-germany/story-JvvJ8Iz7bDyHy6pn5CLsPN.html
26-06-2020||India||Covid-19: Order on mandatory centre visits revoked||People who test positive for Covid-19 will not need to go to a government facility for a mandatory assessment, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) led by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal said on Thursday, walking back from a controversial rule for the second time in less than a week after persistent demands for a reversal.Thursday’s decision was welcomed by the Delhi government, district officials, health care workers, and resident welfare associations across the city.Since Saturday, a large chunk of the 3,500-plus people testing positive through swab every day were required to visit a Covid Care Centre (CCC) to be assessed by a doctor for whether they can isolate themselves at home for the period of their recovery, or stay at a CCC, or be taken to a hospital. This protocol was widely seen as burdening stretched health care staff further, and adding to the risk of infection. The issue was discussed at the meeting of DDMA, also known as state disaster management authority, where the LG is the chairperson. “Yes, the L-G has agreed to revert to the old system where a team led by the district surveillance officer (DSO) will visit the house of the Covid positive patient to decide whether home isolation can be recommended,” deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said after the meeting.In recent days, Sisodia and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal made strong appeals to Baijal and the Union home ministry, to which the LG reports, to abandon the protocol. “People were anxious over the rule that required every person who tested Covid positive to be taken to quarantine centre [for assessment of symptoms],” Sisodia said at a digital press briefing on Thursday.Later in the evening, the directorate general of health services formalised the order in a revised standard operating procedures document.  According a spokesperson from the Union home ministry, Thursday’s decisions “have been taken in accordance with the guidance given by the Union home minister in the meeting held on June 21 to further review and strengthen the surveillance mechanism for Covid positive cases in Delhi to prevent the spread of the disease and to provide timely medical care”.Also read | Delhi records 3,390 Covid-19 cases, widens undesired lead over MumbaiBut the latest order means a return to the protocol “applicable till Friday (June 19), which required medical teams to visit the house of person testing Covid patient and do assessments there. The symptoms and condition of residence would decide if the person could be assigned home isolation or taken to a hospital or quarantine centre,” the deputy CM, who also heads the health department temporarily, pointed out. “We requested central government to roll back that order. We are happy that they have agreed. The old system has been restored now,” he added.The rule for mandatory facility assessment was announced on June 20 during what itself was a reversal of another controversial protocol announced by the DDMA on June 19: mandatory facility quarantine for all patients, including those with no or mild symptoms, for five days. Experts welcomed the rethink. “It is a good decision. The rule that require patients to be mandatorily taken to Covid centres for clinical assessment had two issues. First, it was a logistical nightmare. Second, it increased chances of local transmission. The districts in the city can now focus on strengthening the health care system and stress on contact tracing and better surveillance,” said Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Safdarjung hospital. At least three of the 11 districts in the city were not able to switch to it, due to lack of human resources and adequate number of ambulances, the only mode of travel allowed for Covid positive patients under the now-scrapped protocol. The city has 163 dedicated Covid ambulances, and transporting 3,000 people daily would have required at least 18 trips over a 24-hour period by each on average.“We did our best to implement the rule. We succeeded to some extent by managing to send a few people to CCCs for clinical diagnosis. But we were not sure for how long we could carry such a herculean task. Revocation of the order is a big relief,” said a district magistrate who wished to remain anonymous. Delhi on Thursday added 3,390 new cases, taking the total tally of infections in the Capital to 73,780. The number of fatalities stood at 2,429, according to the Delhi government’s daily health bulletin. In a statement on Thursday, the LG office also clarified about the process of assessment: Those testing through antigen kits “will be examined by the medical officer on duty at the testing site to assess the severity of illness... The assessment on site shall effectively constitute an assessment made at the COVID Care Centre”. This was in line with the existing position.For those who have taken a swab test (RT-PCR), a home Isolation team will be sent by the District Surveillance Officer (DSO) which will check for symptoms and assess the residence to see whether home isolation will be possible. Home isolation will be allowed “if the patient is mild/pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic and has a residence of two rooms or a separate room and a separate toilet for the patient. He/she will be provided a contact number for any consultation required by him along with details of CATS ambulance call number for transfer to hospital in case symptoms develop,” according to the statement. For those with moderate or severe symptoms and underlying health conditions that are known to exacerbate Covid-19, the officials will arrange for transport to a CCC, Covid Health Centre or a hospital. Resident welfare groups in the city also welcomed Thursday’s move, saying it would ease concerns and encourage people to get tested.“We welcome the move. People feared the idea of being sent to Covid centres, even if it was for some clinical assessment. But the government must ensure that their health officials visit each patient’s house in time without fail. We have come across a lot of complaints and the government should take note of that,” said BS Vohra, president of the federation of resident welfare associations in east Delhi.(With inputs from Abhishek Dey in New Delhi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/order-on-mandatory-centre-visits-revoked/story-qekPdplvwyQTNpPRUmFhZM.html
26-06-2020||India||4th phase of Vande Bharat from July 3||HT CorrespondentNew DelhiIndia will launch the fourth phase of Vande Bharat Mission, the largest programme for repatriating stranded nationals, on July 3 after bringing back more than 360,000 nationals from around the world.Vande Bharat Mission was launched in May to bring home hundreds of thousands of Indians stranded across the world because of Covid-19-related restrictions, including students, people facing medical emergencies and workers who had been laid off.“In order to continue with our efforts, phase four of Vande Bharat Mission is being firmed up with effect from July 3 and will particularly focus on countries where we still have large numbers of Indians who have registered to return,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly media briefing on Thursday.Over the past seven weeks, a total of 513,047 Indians registered their request for repatriation with Indian missions abroad and 364,209 have returned as of Thursday.A total of 875 international flights were scheduled from more than 50 countries in the first three phases of the mission, and more than 700 flights have reached India with 150,000 nationals.“These flights have been instrumental in addressing the immediate requirements of stranded Indians in many parts of the world. We are committed to bringing back our remaining compatriots, particularly in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Malaysia, Singapore and other places,” Srivastava said.Chartered flights under the mission began operating on May 26 and have increased over the past few weeks, he said. These flights have brought back 130,061 people, including seafarers and crews of shipping companies stranded in various places.The government will streamline the process for charter flights as demand for them remains very high, especially in West Asia.More than 84,000 Indians have also returned from Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh through land border immigration checkpoints. Naval ships are also bringing back people under the mission. INS Jalashwa reached Bandar Abbas port in Iran on June 24 to bring back a group of Indian citizens, Srivastava said.However, flights by state-run Air India under the mission have run into problems as some countries have demanded that their countries too should be allowed to operate similar repatriation flights to India. The US has said flights under the mission will need to obtain permission 30 days in advance from July 22 as the Indian government has been engaging in “discriminatory” treatment of American airlines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4th-phase-of-vande-bharat-from-july-3/story-ucuFzeUiRH8mtzZzHk12nM.html
26-06-2020||India||Pvt sector will build rockets, says ISRO||New Delhi: Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chairman K Sivan on Thursday said the private sector will be allowed to provide end-to-end space services, including building and launching rockets and satellites. “The private sector will be enabled to carry out space activities like building of rockets, satellites, providing launch services on a commercial basis. ...[It] can also be part of interplanetary missions of ISRO. This is being planned to be done through the announcement of opportunities,” he said at an online briefing. The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the formation of Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) to open up the space infrastructure to the private sector. IN-SPACe will play a supplementary role to ISRO and will independently evaluate and approve space-related activities.ISRO scientists have so far designed all launch vehicles and satellites and the private players were brought in to manufacture components.Sivan said the Centre’s move to open up the space infrastructure will boost the country’s industrial base and improve access to space-based services. He added ISRO’s activities are not going to be reduced and it will continue to carry out space-based activities, including advanced research and development, inter-planetary and human space flight missions.Sivan said private companies have already approached them for using ISRO facilities and that they were processing the requests under a fast-track mode.He added the mechanism may take three to six months to become operational and private companies can until then apply through the space department. Sivan said IN-SPACe will be an independent body and have its own directorates for technical, legal, safety and security, and activity promotion as well as for monitoring purposes. The IN-SPACe board will have representation from industry, academia, and the government.Sivan underlined the need for new policies and revamping the old ones for the system to function effectively. He added the role of the New Space India Limited, ISRO’s commercial arm set up last year, would be modified to empower it to take over existing launch vehicle and satellite technologies and commercialise them through industry consortiums. It will undertake technology transfer activities, (said Sivan?).Experts have been demanding that the private sector be involved in the routine space activities like launching communication and earth observation satellites to free up resources for exploration.India’s space endeavours have picked up the pace. Another lander-rover mission to moon, solar mission Aditya L1, human spaceflight programme, and a mission to Venus are expected in the next few years.Rajeswari Rajagopalan, who heads Observer Research Foundation’s nuclear and space policy initiative, said if India does not accelerate the pace of privatisation of space sector, other countries will overtake it. “India has a lot of advantage in terms of cost and reliability, but if we do not improve our pace in terms of the number of launches and the kind of missions that we do, others who may not have as much of an advantage will get into the global commercial space market.”Rajagopalan said China does low-cost launches and they are capturing that market. “Other than that, there are several companies such as Space X and Blue Origin which are also going to get into that market space. So unless India gets its act together, we will lose out on our share of the pie.” Rajagopalan said ISRO has not been very enthusiastic about involving the private sector. “ISRO has enjoyed complete monopoly and certain privilege in undertaking space mission so far because they are the only actors and why would they like to bring in competition from outside.”Rajagopalan added ISRO will now be judged against the performance of other players. “We have seen this in telecom and airline industries. It brings in competitiveness but also efficiency. Unless it is a politically pushed measure, ISRO, on its own, does not have any incentive to go ahead with it.”Rajagopalan said there is not much excitement in the industry right now. “It is a wait-and-watch approach because essentially it will all depend on the execution of this announcement into reality. ISRO prefers an outsourcing model. There is no clear sense of how this new body will work. Also, there is a need for an appropriate legislative and regulatory framework that will enable the private sector to have a level playing field.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pvt-sector-will-build-rockets-says-isro/story-ZrXgONt5ekFWuVDfEFMGGL.html
26-06-2020||India||Covid-19 crisis: Sero survey to cover 20,000 people across Delhi’s 11 districts||Health officials will launch a sero survey covering 20,000 people across Delhi’s 11 districts over the weekend to determine the spread of the coronavirus disease amidst a rising number of cases, according to a plan for the national capital. The National Centre for Disease Control, which functions under the Union health ministry, and the Delhi government will jointly conduct the survey that will focus on antibody-based blood tests to find out residents’ past exposure to the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19. The sero surveillance is one of the five aspects of Delhi’s revised Covid-19 response plan that was developed after a meeting between Union home minister Amit Shah and Delhi government officials on Sunday. HT has reviewed a copy of the document, and a Delhi government official has earlier confirmed that the survey will start over the weekend.Antibody tests began in Delhi in April but were put on hold after allegations over the quality of Chinese kits used at that time.The National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune has developed an improved ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)-based antibody kit that yielded good results in a pilot sero survey, an official of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said.Also read | Door-to-door survey in Delhi to map coronavirus spread“...we advise people to use these kits for serological testing, apart from other ones that are approved by USFDA (US Food and Drug Administration) and CLIA (Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassays) kits,” the official said.A serological test is meant to detect antibodies in blood. The presence of antibodies suggests a past exposure to the coronavirus. During outbreaks, health authorities conduct serosurveys to find out the prevalence of the infection in a community. In May, ICMR conducted a pilot sero survey across 83 districts in 21 states. The results showed that the percentage of general population to have been infected in the past was 0.73%, with urban areas having shown higher Covid-19 prevalence of about 1.09%. “Depending upon the level of sero prevalence of infection, appropriate public health interventions can be planned and implemented for prevention and control of the disease. Periodic sero surveys are useful to guide policymakers,” said the ICMR official.Delhi recorded 3,390 new cases on Thursday, ending the day with a total of 73,780 cases (26,586 of them active).The NIV-validated kit is called “Covid Kavach ELISA”, a test kit for the detection of Covid-19 Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, which is the most common antibody in blood and other body fluids that immune system makes. It takes about two weeks to develop and is indicative of a past infection.The kit’s specificity is 97.9% and sensitivity is 92.37%, according to ICMR. The higher the sensitivity, the fewer false negatives a test will give. Tests with high specificity have fewer false positives.Also read | 182 people covered under Covid-19 sero-survey, 32 found to have developed antibodies“Antibody test sensitivity [to detect true negatives] and specificity [to detect true positives] is usually low,” Dr Ekta Gupta, a senior virologist at Delhi government-run Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), said.ICMR has partnered with Zydus Cadila, a leading Indian Pharmaceutical company, for the mass-scale production of these test kits. “Our pilot sero survey results conducted from across India were near accurate. The kit is working fine,” said the ICMR official quoted above.Apart from ELISA, experts said the technologically advanced CLIA-based antibody tests were giving better results.“CLIA tests are a step ahead of ELISA assays in terms of technology. Therefore, the results will be more accurate. We are seeing them work better,” said Dr Gupta.Many laboratories in India are using CLIA-based antibody tests, and some private players vouched for CLIA kits. “The CLIA kits that we are using are showing 100% sensitivity and 99.83% specificity — which is very good. An additional plus is that these kits are designed to exclude influenza A and B viruses, so the results are quite accurate,” Gauri Aggarwal, director, Genestrings laboratory, said.Dr Chand Wattal, chairman, clinical microbiology and immunology, Ganga Ram Hospital, said: “CLIA-based tests are proving to be better. Now that we are using these, we can see the difference in accuracy.”Since CLIA kit is new, the consistency will become apparent after at least one week, according to experts conducting covis-19 tests.“We will have to wait for at least a week or so to see whether the performance in terms of both sensitivity and specificity is the same as it is now. It’s a new test and sometimes performance varies batch to batch that needs to be seen before we can really say that these antibody kits are better,” Aggarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sero-survey-to-cover-20k-across-delhi-s-11-districts/story-wR6GfYqXWv3LM5mkOCMdTP.html
26-06-2020||India||Baghjan blowout: NGT sets up panel, imposes fine on OIL||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has constituted an eight-member committee of experts to probe the blowout, subsequent fire at an Oil India Limited (OIL) well at Baghjan in Assam’s Tinsukia district and the damage it has caused to humans, wildlife and environment. In an order passed via video conferencing on Wednesday, NGT directed OIL to deposit Rs 25 crore with the district administration as interim compensation for the damage.The well is located near the Maguri Motapung Wetland and Dibru Saikhowa Biosphere Reserve, which are among the few remaining habitats for several endangered and range-restricted species. The blowout led to the uncontrollable flow of oil from gas and caused extensive damage to biodiversity and wildlife in the region. The wildlife includes endangered hoolock gibbons and the Gangetic dolphins.The well caught fire on June 9 days after the blowout triggered an uncontrolled release of gas and oil condensate on May 27. The fire has claimed the lives of two firefighters and displaced 1,600 families residing close to the site.Justice (Retd) B P Katakey of the Gauhati High Court will head the panel, which will also include Tinsukia’s district magistrate. The panel will have members from the Central Pollution Control Board, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.The committee will look into the blowout cause, the extent of losses, and probe whether any contamination of the air, water, and soil has been caused. It will study the impact on Dibru-Saikhowa National Park and Maguri Motapung Wetland, assess compensation for those affected, and suggest preventive and remedial measures.The tribunal has directed the committee to submit its preliminary report “as expeditiously as possible and not later than 30 days” from the date of issue of the order. NGT will take up the matter next on July 29.“In view of the prima facie case made out against OIL on the extent of damage caused to the environment and biodiversity, damage to both human and wildlife, public health and having regard to the financial worth of the company and the extent of damage, we direct OIL to deposit an initial amount of Rs 25 cr with the district magistrate Tinsukia and shall abide by further orders of the tribunal,” NGT said in its order.OIL has said it will take experts about a month to control the fire and plug the blowout. Heavy rainfall in the area since Monday and the collapse of a bridge along the route to the well have hampered the work at the site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baghjan-blowout-ngt-sets-up-panel-imposes-fine-on-oil/story-CorZiC0XGCaSJFV76CND0O.html
26-06-2020||India||Except Covid-19, don’t see any problem in holding polls in Jammu & Kashmir: GC Murmu||The first lieutenant governor of the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir, Girish Chandra Murmu, spoke to Hindustan Times about opening up the political space for parties, setting up the delimitation commission, and holding elections, among other issues. Edited excerpts:President’s Rule is a temporary provision. The Election Commission (EC) has announced members to the delimitation commission, and political parties are conducting outreach programmes -- so, the political process is there. We wanted to have local body elections in February and March but Covid-19 played spoilsport. The EC is the competent authority to take a call on delimitation. Except Covid, I don’t see any problem in holding elections.There is a mechanism to review detentions. Most detainees have been released. Beyond a certain period, you can’t detain politicians. India is a secular, socialist, democratic republic where people choose their leaders. So everyone has a role to play. Any old or new party has an equal right to elect and be elected. There is nothing like a new political landscape. Revoking the temporary provision (Article 370) was a historic decision. It has opened up more opportunities for people to participate and be masters of their destiny. There can be a new or old party, or a combination. They have their own opportunities and challenges, but they have been leaders. People will decide. I’m not aware of an advisory council. Under President’s Rule, the power rests with the governor or LG who takes advice from professionals. In J&K, we have four advisers. I don’t think that kind of arrangement (advisory council) exists anywhere. Maybe it was rumour.There are forces from outside and within aiding and abetting such activities but our security forces are taking on the challenges and have succeeded to a great extent. We are trying developmental programmes for participatory management and growth. I see it as a phenomenon that was there earlier too, and occasionally returns in the form of desperate attempts [to disrupt peace].We want to secure the entire UT and its people. Of course, there is a provision to provide security to vulnerable representatives, depending upon the threat perception, but my intention is to give a general sense of well-being. We have an area domination mechanism in place but yes in rare cases, security cover can be thought of.It’s been going on for the past many years in a bid to destabilise us, but our security forces have been able to contain terrorism. The key is in all-round development. Let there be growth and employment so that everyone, particularly youngsters, gets an opportunity to progress. Unemployment is a global phenomenon, and post-Covid, most nations have suffered. J&K could not build infrastructure earlier and create job opportunities... If things get normal, the global investors’ summit will be held in October. Let’s see how things evolve due to the pandemic but pooja will take place at Amarnath. We will take a decision ...on the Vaishno Devi pilgrimage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/except-covid-don-t-see-any-problem-in-holding-polls-in-jammu-kashmir-gc-murmu/story-dD81Ae4DXW6J6Ht62XB50J.html
26-06-2020||India||Manipur crisis: Rebel NPP MLAs back in fold||Eight days after they withdrew support to the Bharatiya Janata Party-led ruling coalition in Manipur, all four National People’s Party (NPP) legislators pledged their support to the ruling coalition on Thursday. The MLAs met governor Najma Heptulla the Raj Bhawan in Imphal and backed the government. All four are likely to be re-inducted as ministers soon.“A delegation of National People’s Party led by Conrad Sangma along with Himanta Biswa Sarma called on me and all the 4 MLAs gave their letter of support to the BJP led government in the state of Manipur,” Heptulla tweeted.The development came a day after lawmakers, who flew out of Imphal on Tuesday, met Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda in New Delhi. They were accompanied by NPP chief and Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma and senior Assam minister and convener of North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), Himanta Biswa Sarma.“Both leaders gave us a very patient hearing and all issues which were there we expressed them all in detail to them. They have understood what the problem is and have assured that all issues will be addressed and taken care of,” Sangma told journalists.But the Delhi meeting may have upset some sections of the state BJP unit with two senior leaders expressing their opposition to any deal struck with the NPP. “They put the party in a spot. They tried to pull out support at the last minute and when they realised the BJP government will not topple, they agreed to come back with conditions,” said a senior party leader on condition of anonymity. A second leader said the BJP was not falling short of numbers and would complete its full term. “There is a problem between the leaders that needs to be sorted out; but for now the CM is unlikely to be replaced. Going forward the national leadership will ensure that concerns of all sides are met,” a senior leader based in Delhi said.The three-year-old ruling coalition ran into a crisis on June 17 when three BJP MLAs resigned and six others — four from NPP, one from Trinamool Congress and one independent -- withdrew support to the N Biren Singh government.The MLAs joined hands with the opposition Congress and formed a Secular Progressive Front (SPF). Leaders from the SPF met the governor twice, seeking convening of a special assembly session to hold a floor test.In the middle of the crisis, the BJP candidate won the Rajya Sabha election on July 19 securing 28 votes to the Congress pick’s 24.On Wednesday, a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) team questioned Congress leader and former chief minister O Ibobi Singh in connection with a case of alleged misappropriation of funds.“The only way for BJP to be in power in Manipur is by using CBI against Congress MLAs, maneuvering Raj Bhawan to slow down attempts by Congress to form government along with allies and by giving pressure to Manipur MLAs by calling them to Delhi,” Manipur Congress spokesperson Nignombam Bupenda Meitei said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-crisis-rebel-npp-mlas-back-in-fold/story-FFF4Vml7YayPAkv8QwWMmM.html
26-06-2020||India||Back from Leh, Army chief to brief govt on LAC situation||In the course of his two day visit to Ladakh, Army chief General MM Naravane — who returned to Delhi on Thursday — was briefed on the army’s preparations and ability to respond to threatening actions by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA), and the latest developments along the contested border, said three officers who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The army chief will now brief the top political leadership. The security review of the Ladakh sector, where tensions rose sharply after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash in the Galwan Valley on June 15, saw the chief tour forward army bases at Durbuk and Chushul, interact with commanders on the ground and undertake aerial surveys of the army’s deployments in some sensitive sectors, said one of the officers cited above.Also read | India rejects as untenable Chinese claim on Ladakh’s Galwan valleyThe sectors where Indian soldiers hold forward positions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) include Depsang, Gogra Post-Hot Springs, Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Chumar, and military negotiations for disengagement in some of these areas are in progress.Naravane is expected to brief the political leadership on the military’s assessment of the volatile situation along the LAC and steps being taken to ease tensions that could threaten stability in the backdrop of both armies significantly stepping up their military presence, said the second officer cited above.The situation on the ground is tricky, said the third officer cited above. “There’s mutual consensus on disengagement but continuing Chinese military buildup calls into question the PLA’s intent to restore status quo ante in strategic areas,” he said, adding that Naravane’s visit served as a morale booster for forward deployed soldiers.“The army chief’s visit is significant in the wake of recent events that have caused considerable turbulence on the LAC. Also, there has been no concrete commitment by the PLA to stabilise the situation,” said former army vice chief Lieutenant General AS Lamba (retd).Also read | US shifting military to face Chinese threat to India and Southeast Asia: Mike PompeoNaravane, on Wednesday, awarded commendation cards to three soldiers who were part of the outnumbered Indian squad that bravely fought off Chinese soldiers in Galwan Valley. Among other troops who were awarded commendation cards by Naravane were two soldiers who displayed courage and resolve during a violent face-off with Chinese troops near Pangong Tso on May 5-6.Both face-offs saw Chinese soldiers gather in large numbers and attack Indian troops with stones, iron rods and nail-studded clubs.Last week, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria made a low-key visit to Ladakh to review the Indian Air Force (IAF)‘s preparedness in the sector, where the IAF has also raised its guard to deal with any military provocations by the Chinese forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/back-from-leh-army-chief-to-brief-govt-on-lac-situation/story-TsHH2VyANW5u4LyPqbM4WL.html
26-06-2020||India||India-China troops’ disengagement along LAC a ‘Test Match, not Twenty20’||Senior army officers on Thursday said disengagement of forward deployed Indian and Chinese forces from friction areas along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) would be a “cumbersome and long-drawn process”, responding to some news reports of a slight retreat by both armies in Galwan Valley.Disengagement of forces has not begun, said one of the officers with direct knowledge of the border row.“You can say it’s going to play out like a Test match and not T20 cricket. It will be a cumbersome, complicated and long-drawn exercise,” he said, asking not to be identified.Senior Indian and Chinese military commanders reached a consensus -- during an 11-hour meeting on June 22 -- on disengaging from friction points along the LAC, which has been tense since a brutal brawl in Galwan Valley on June 15 led to 20 Indian and an unspecified number of Chinese soldiers dead.“Consensus doesn’t mean the ground situation will change overnight. It may take weeks, or even months, for the border to become stable,” said the second officer cited above, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.There was no official word from the army on the disengagement process even as army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane flew back from Leh to New Delhi on Thursday after conducting a detailed security review of the Ladakh sector over two days. Top officials briefed him on the latest developments along the LAC.Both officers quoted above said the Indian Army had raised its guard, and was planning and preparing for the long haul. Disengagement will be carried out in phases across different sectors on a verifiable basis, they said.Experts agreed with their assessment of the border row, marked by a significant military buildup on both sides of the LAC at multiple locations -- especially in Depsang, Gogra Post-Hot Springs, Galwan Valley and Pangong Tso.Also read | India rejects as untenable Chinese claim on Ladakh’s Galwan valleyThe disengagement process will be “tough and complex” beyond the shadow of a doubt, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).“The Indian Army will have to keep its guard up at every stage of the proposed disengagement. We will have to move ahead with caution, given what happened in Galwan Valley during a previous disengagement exercise,” Hooda said.China has not halted — and instead ramped up — its military activity along LAC in eastern Galwan Valley, with a concentration of soldiers, military vehicles, earth-moving machinery, and erection of structures, including near the same point where Indian and Chinese troops clashed on June 15, HT reported on Thursday. Satellite images of the area on June 22, reviewed by China watchers and officials, suggested Chinese buildup in Galwan Valley, where the Indian army observed that a new structure, suspected to be an observation post, has come up near Patrol Point 14, the site of the June 15 clash.The Chinese buildup in other areas along the LAC, including Depsang, Gogra Post-Hot Springs and Pangong Tso, has not thinned either, people familiar with developments said. The army is keeping a strict vigil along the LAC and is fully prepared to respond to any provocation or adventurism by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA), they added.While disengagement in Gogra Post-Hot Springs and the Galwan Valley sectors is believed to be a “low-hanging fruit” and can possibly be achieved in a reasonable time-frame, the “real test” would lie in the restoration of status quo ante in the Finger Area in Pangong-Tso, where the PLA has set up permanent bunkers, pillboxes and observation posts, they said.China has deployed more than 10,000 troops in its “depth areas” across the LAC in eastern Ladakh and the military buildup consists of fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns, missile systems and air defence radars. India has matched the neighbour’s military moves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disengagement-like-a-test-match-not-t20-officials/story-V7oaJLE17R01ELNtfDgzYI.html
26-06-2020||India||BJP raises China funds to Cong trust||Questioning the link between China and the Congress, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday alleged that both the Chinese government and the Chinese embassy in India contributed to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF) — a trust chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi — with former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and P Chidambaram as trustees.The BJP, led by Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, also alleged that RGF had pushed for a free trade agreement between the two countries, leading to a huge trade deficit skewed in favour of China, and that the donation led to the Congress supporting China.The Congress, in turn, said the BJP was engaging in diversionary tactics, questioned it on visits and exchanges between the BJP and the Communist Party of China (CPC) over the past decade, alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared a “strange bonhomie” with China even as borders were insecure, and claimed that questioning the patriotism of the Congress was “outrageous”.The political war of words between the two parties on the national security intensified with the BJP alleging that RGF’s annual report for 2005-06 showed it received donation from the embassy of the People’s Republic of China and was listed as a donor.“They (Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi) are attacking the Narendra Modi government and supporting China because of these donations to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation,” Prasad said. “The document clearly shows the embassy as a donor.”“The Congress should explain why such affection for China? There is a Foreign Contribution Regulation Act that says any political party or organisation cannot accept foreign funds, and the RGF was an extension of the Congress party. Did they take permission before taking money? Did they inform the government why they had taken the money?” he asked.Amit Malviya, head of the BJP’s social media team, tweeted: “Not just the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in India but even the government of People’s Republic of China is a donor to the Rajiv Gandhi foundation.”Addressing a virtual rally in Madhya Pradesh, BJP president JP Nadda said during the 2017 Doklam standoff, Rahul Gandhi was secretly holding talks with China’s ambassador to India in Delhi. “Today, during Galwan Valley clash also Congress is misleading the country,” Nadda said.The Congress, in turn, alleged that PM Modi shared a “strange bonhomie” with China, though India had not benefitted from it.At a virtual press conference, party spokesperson Pawan Khera alleged, “There is a strange kind of bonhomie between Narendra Modi and China, a two-decade-old bonhomie. Why doesn’t the country get the benefit of that bonhomie? Whatever is happening on the border today, is it despite the bonhomie which you have with China, or is it because of the bonhomie which you have with China?”The allegation was echoed by the party’s foreign affairs department chief Anand Sharma, who said that questioning the patriotism of the Congress — which had led the freedom movement — was “outrageous”.Khera also questioned the role of India Foundation, an organisation closely affiliated with the BJP, in strengthening the bonds with China.“Why does India Foundation keep visiting these countries? Who do they meet? What’s the outcome? What’s the role of NSA Ajit Doval’s son — Shaurya Doval? He keeps attending these meetings through India Foundation? These are important questions in the light of what is happening,” he said.HT tried to reach out to Shaurya Doval, but there was no response till the time of going to press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-raises-china-funds-to-cong-trust/story-iqsPTq6mafUiujINxfCSOO.html
26-06-2020||India||India rejects as untenable Chinese claim on Ladakh’s Galwan valley||India on Thursday squarely blamed China for the standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), saying Beijing had massed troops along the disputed frontier since May, violated a recent understanding to disengage in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley and disregarded all mutually agreed norms for border patrols.The Indian position on the months-old standoff was outlined in a lengthy and sharply worded statement from the external affairs ministry as tensions simmered due to the continuing Chinese military build-up in several sections of the LAC, especially in Ladakh, which has been the focus of the face-off.While accusing China of triggering several face-offs by trying to unilaterally change the status quo along the LAC, the Indian side also rejected the Chinese side’s “unjustified and untenable” claim on the Galwan Valley. The statement also acknowledged both sides “remain deployed in large numbers in the region”.The external affairs ministry’s statement came even as Chinese envoy Sun Weidong said in an interview to PTI that the onus wasn’t on his country to resolve the border standoff. Sun said he hoped the Indian side would meet the Chinese side halfway and avoid any actions that could complicate the situation.The Indian side, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said, had clearly established that China’s actions had led to the increase in tensions and the violent face-off of June 15 in the Galwan Valley that left 20 Indian soldiers dead. Explaining the context of the standoff and the issues the two sides are trying to address, Srivastava said in a statement: “At the heart of the matter is that since early May, the Chinese side has been amassing a large contingent of troops and armaments along the LAC. This is not in accordance with the provisions of our various bilateral agreements, especially the key 1993 Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas.”This agreement states each side will keep its military forces in areas along the LAC to a “minimum level compatible with friendly and good neighbourly relations”. Following the Chinese build-up, India had to make “counter deployments and the resulting tension has thereafter expressed itself”.Referring to the Galwan Valley, the flashpoint in the current tensions, the statement said a meeting of corps commanders of the two sides on June 6 had agreed on a process for de-escalation and disengagement along the LAC that “involved reciprocal actions”. Both sides also agreed to “respect and abide by the LAC and not undertake any activity to alter the status quo”.However, the Chinese side departed from these understandings on the LAC in the Galwan Valley and “sought to erect structures just across the LAC”. The statement added, “When this attempt was foiled, Chinese troops took violent actions on 15 June 2020 that directly resulted in casualties.”Even before these actions, the Chinese side had hindered India’s normal and traditional patrolling pattern in the Galwan Valley since early May. The resulting face-off was addressed by ground commanders in line with the provisions of bilateral agreements and protocols. In mid-May, the Chinese side also sought to change the status quo in other areas of the western sector, and India registered its protest through diplomatic and military channels.The statement said that while there were occasional departures from established mutually agreed procedures and norms for patrolling in the past, “the conduct of Chinese forces this year has been in complete disregard of all mutually agreed norms”.Both sides had developed patterns of patrolling over many years and it is the “reasonable expectation that patrols will not be obstructed in the discharge of their legitimate duties”. However, the Indian side has experienced obstruction to patrolling that is often accompanied by efforts to unilaterally change the status quo along the LAC.Indian troops are fully familiar with the LAC’s alignment in all sectors and abide scrupulously by it. They have also patrolled all along the LAC, including in the Galwan Valley, “for a long time”, the statement said.“All infrastructure built by the Indian side has always been on its own side of the LAC. The Indian side has never undertaken any actions across the LAC and has never attempted to unilaterally change the status quo. However, that has not been reciprocated by the Chinese side and that from time to time has led to face-offs,” the statement added. Peace and tranquillity in border areas is “the basis of our bilateral relationship” and it is “imperative that the established mechanisms are used by both parties to address the current situation”, the statement said.Describing Wednesday’s meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs as “a significant development”, the Indian side also noted that the corps commanders had on June 22 discussed the implementation of understandings reached between them on June 6. The foreign ministers too agreed during a phone conversation on June 17 that the disengagement understanding of June 6 would be implemented.People familiar with developments said India has been insisting on implementing the understanding of June 6 because it includes the removal of structures built by the Chinese along the LAC in the Galwan Valley.“We expect the Chinese side to sincerely follow up on this understanding and ensure the expeditious restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas. A continuation of the current situation would only vitiate the atmosphere for the development of the relationship,” the statement said.Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, a distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said while there were no immediate indications of a possible conflict between the two sides, a breakthrough on the ground would depend on the actions of the Chinese side.“The candour on the Indian side is welcome because the public is being taken into confidence. The perception is that the army commanders have reached an accord but there is much to be desired in its implementation by the Chinese side,” he said.“We have had talks at the level of generals and diplomats, though the level of negotiations will have to be further enhanced. We will have to wait and see, and much depends on the actual activities on the ground.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-as-untenable-chinese-claim-on-galwan/story-XkMg6yuKz2iB6hLlflKrxO.html
26-06-2020||India||Covid-19: NRI deaths sully Kerala’s Gulf dream||Mohammad Hussein’s family in Kerala was looking forward to his return from Qatar, where he had been working for 20 years, when they received a call in May from a volunteer group working for the benefit of expatriates saying his condition was serious after having contracted Covid-19. A week later the family received photos of Hussein’s burial.Hussein, 47, is among 296 expatriates from Kerala who have died of Covid-19 in West Asia, according to preliminary information with the state government. Migrant rights activists say the number of deaths could be higher and that many of them could have been prevented had the government shown a sense of urgency in evacuating them.“He has four children, all younger than 20. With the breadwinner gone, it will be difficult for the family now,” said Mohammad Ashraf, Hussein’s brother.Some families, who can afford it, are paying to keep the bodies in mortuaries, hoping they can be brought back when commercial flights resume. “My father’s body is in a morgue in Bahrain. And we are paying through our nose. We hope the body can be brought back once the situation improves,” said the daughter of another person, who succumbed to the infection.As many as 4,56, 431 expatriates wanting to return home registered on the government-run Non-Resident Keralites Affairs department website in April. According to the state government data, over 90,000 have so far been evacuated. But the website says only 55, 905 have returned till June 22. An official said the website has not be updated.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday said 98,202 people have returned from abroad to the state. He added 80% of them have flown back from West Asia.There was much outrage this month after the state made Covid-free certificates mandatory for the returnees. The Kerala government stood its ground until the Centre rejected the condition saying tests were infeasible at Indian embassies at the point of embarkation. The state, until as late as June 18, said it was ready to send kits to test people before they board evacuation flights.Many of the non-resident Indians from Kerala, an estimated 1.8 million, work in West Asia. Kerala accounted for 19% of the $ 78.6 billion remittances India received in 2019, according to the World Bank data. Kerala’s remittances crossed ₹one lakh crore, the highest in the country, in 2019.Expatriates have contributed significantly to the state’s economy and stepped in every time Kerala faced natural disasters. They have been praised for their contributions. But many expatriates feel they have been let down badly by both the Centre and state government, which have been busy in a blame game over their evacuations.Expatriates say many lives could have been saved if people had been evacuated in the early days of the pandemic. “We lost golden hours. Many lives could have been saved if we evacuated them in the early months of the pandemic. Now the state government says expatriates can be super spreaders,” said Reji Kuttappan, a writer and migrant rights activist.Indian Overseas Congress convenor Mansoor Paloor echoed Kuttappan. “Even chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the state put restrictions on returnees to check super spreaders. His words sent a wrong message.”Union minister V Muraleedharan, who is from Kerala, said the Centre was ready to provide at least 36 flights daily to the state in May but the local government restricted them to less than 12, saying they do not have facilities to tackle a surge in the number of returnees.Vijayan denied any laxity on the part of his government and said there was a “concerted move” to make expatriates turn against it. “We never blocked any flights. We took such some decisions to check super spreaders and community spreading. More than 90% of the cases in the state are imported...”The Congress-led opposition has criticised the government saying it is more interested in maintaining its record of managing the pandemic well and not in the welfare of stranded people and that led to many deaths. “The government could have brought them home and treated here instead of leaving them to die abroad,” said Congress leader Oommen Chandy.“Expatriates’ contributions are immense. Instead of blame game, both, the state and Centre, will have to alleviate their suffering,” said political observer and columnist G Pramod Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nri-deaths-sully-kerala-s-gulf-dream/story-nMoiqHEL1WLetlflDdVBlM.html
26-06-2020||India||CBI inquiry against former J&K minister||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a preliminary enquiry (PE) against former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Chaudhary Lal Singh for alleged corruption and land grabbing by R B Educational Trust he runs in Jammu & Kashmir’s Kathua, officials said on Thursday. Singh quit as a minister in the then People’s Democratic Party-BJP government in Jammu & Kashmir in April 2018 after he attended rallies in support of the men accused of raping and murdering an eight-year-old girl. He left BJP in February 2019.The officials cited above said the PE, which is the first step before a case is registered, has been lodged to investigate allegations of “illegal gratification and extraneous consideration by the revenue and forest officials of district Kathua in allowing sale and purchase of forest land”.False certificates claiming that the land comes under the exempted category were used to purchase it for trust.HT could not reach Singh for comments as his phone was switched off.An official cited the PE and said trust is in possession of huge tracts of land in gross violation of ceiling prescribed under the Jammu and Kashmir Agrarian Reforms Act, 1976. False information was also submitted allegedly in the Jammu & Kashmir high court in 2015 in favour of the trust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-inquiry-against-former-j-k-minister/story-xvr8iNW5YFMIrT8vA8qKkO.html

Jitu Patwari, the former minister from Congress, provoked outrage when on Wednesday he tweeted: “Five daughters were born namely demonetisation, goods and sales tax (GST), employment, inflation and economic slowdown while anticipating a son called development (vikas).”He deleted the tweet after chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan hit out at him and the Congress and called them anti-woman. Patwari regretted his comments and said daughters are like goddesses. “My tweet was to suggest how people have been waiting for years for development promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi but they got instead demonetisation, GST, unemployment, inflation and economic slowdown which have broken the backbone of the economy.”Chouhan accused the Congress of insulting women and asked Sonia Gandhi, the party chief, to apologise to the nation and sack Patwari.The Congress accused BJP of being anti-Dalit and said it has a “prejudiced mindset” when a photograph purportedly showing Dalit leader Prabhuram Chaudhary being served food on a disposable plate in front of his upper-caste BJP colleague, Ashutosh Tiwari, who is seen eating from a metal plate, went viral on (social media?). HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the photo. Chaudhary was among the 22 lawmakers whose resignations in March brought down the Congress government in the state and allowed BJP to return to power. He has since joined BJP.Congress leader Sajjan Singh Verma said the difference is clearly seen in how respect was given to the upper caste leader and how Chaudhary was treated. “Being a member of the Dalit community does not mean that the former minister [Chaudhary] can be treated like this.”Tiwari could not be reached for his comments while Chaudhary refused to comment.BJP leader Hitesh Bajpai said Tiwari carries his own plate due to some health issues and now because of Covid-19. “It is unfortunate that Congress jumps the gun without trying to know what really happened. Congress wants to create an issue as it knows it cannot win by-polls without raising non-issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-daughters-for-son-congress-leader-s-remark-stirs-row-in-mp/story-9RrnlAZdDeWwZ1nUx5duhM.html
26-06-2020||India||Junior foreign minister mocks Kerala CM’s conditions for evacuation of expats||Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan on Thursday mocked Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan saying some of his suggestions on evacuation of expatriates from the West Asian countries were without any logic and MEA cannot chalk out a separate plan for those countries.“Usually people take pickle and chips while returning from Kerala. The CM thinks that test kits can be sent like this. His demands are without any logic or reasoning. We will go by the standard operating protocols issued by the Home and Health ministries,” he said in New Delhi.Last week the CM had suggested that the state was ready to provide TrueNat testing kits to get expatriates tested before boarding their flights. TrueNat test is usually used to detect tuberculosis and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had recently recommended this also for widening the range of options for testing Covid-19 patients. The CM had also said special flights could be arranged for Covid-19 positive passengers.“The CM is coming out with weird demands. No other state has put such conditions before the Centre. We are committed to bring back stranded people. But the state is putting many conditions to delay the process,” he said. Muraleedharan, who also hails from Kerala criticised Vijayan for “terming returnees from the middle-east as super spreaders” of Covid-19 When asked about this, the CM evaded a direct reply saying the junior minister in the MEA has no idea what was happening at the Centre that is why he was raising frequent charges against the state government. He said experts have warned a big surge in cases by August- end and asked people not to lower their guard.Vijayan and Muraleedharan had locked horns on several occasions over the evacuation of expatriates. Muraleedharan had said the state was delaying evacuation by putting “unreasonable conditions” but the state blamed the Centre for the delay. Meanwhile, Kerala recorded 123 fresh Covid-19 cases on Thursday. It was the seventh consecutive day Kerala reported more than 100 cases. The state’s Covid-19 tally now stands at 3,726. Out of these, 1761 are active cases while 1,941 people have recovered. The state has reported 23 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/junior-foreign-minister-mocks-kerala-cm-s-conditions-for-evacuation-of-expats/story-nk8kVBougbTSwPOZ4hITSP.html
26-06-2020||India||BJP, Cong spar on 45th Emergency anniversary||On the 45th anniversary of Emergency on Thursday, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress traded accusations about lack of democracy in their respective political parties.While Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that the sacrifice made by the people who fought against the imposition of Emergency will never be forgotten, union home minister Amit Shah attacked the Congress, critiqued the concentration of power in “one family”, and said that the opposition party should ask why the “Emergency mindset” continues. The Congress, in turn, attacked Modi and Shah for “hijacking” the BJP, sidelining elder leaders, centralising all power, and leaving no space for others to express their views. On June 25, 1975, the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had imposed the Emergency, which saw a suspension of fundamental rights, detention of political leaders, dismissal of a range of state governments, and significant constitutional changes. She announced elections two years later, which led to the defeat of the Congress for the first time in post-Independence India and the installation of the Janata Party-led government. The Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the political predecessor of the BJP, was a part of the umbrella Janata formation. Also read | ‘5 daughters for son’: Congress leader’s remark stirs row in MPIn a series of tweets, Shah made a pointed reference to Tuesday’s Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting, where former union minister RPN Singh was reported to have called for restraint against direct attacks on PM Modi. Singh, who is the party in-charge of Jharkhand affairs, has argued that the Congress leaders should rather criticise the government’s policies and raise people-centric issues.However, he was countered by other leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who praised former Congress president Rahul Gandhi for taking on Modi. For his part, Rahul Gandhi said he will continue to attack the Prime Minister, claiming that “it is Modi alone who formulates policies and takes all decisions” in the present government.Shah took a dig at the Congress leadership and the Gandhi family without naming it.“During the recent CWC meet, senior members in younger members raised a few issues. But, they were shouted down. A party Spokesperson was unceremoniously sacked. The sad truth is — leaders are feeling suffocated in Congress”, he tweeted and attacked a link to a media report about the proceedings at the CWC. Shah’s comment was in reference to the removal of Sanjay Jha as the party’s spokesperson, after he criticised the party’s functioning in an opinion piece.In a separate tweet, Shah said, “As one of India’s opposition parties, Congress needs to ask itself: why does the emergency mindset remain? Why are the leaders who don’t belong to one dynasty unable to speak up? Why are leaders getting frustrated in Congress? Else, the disconnect with the people will keep widening.”The former BJP party president went on to say it was due to the efforts of lakhs of people that emergency was lifted, but is still missing in the Congress. “Democracy was restored in India but it remained absent in the Congress. The interests of one family prevailed over party interests and national interests. This sorry state of affairs thrives in today‘a Congress too!” he tweeted.Also read | BJP-led govt in Manipur back in saddle as 4 NPP MLAs withdraw resignationsWhile the Congress vehemently denied these allegations, Shah pinned the blame for the imposition on Emergency on the Gandhi family, without naming names. He said, “On this day 45 years ago, one family’s greed for power led to the imposition of the Emergency and turned the nation in to a prison. The press, the courts, free speech…all were trampled over. Atrocities were committed on the poor and the downtrodden.”Shah’s comments drew a sharp response from the Congress leaders.Rajasthan chief minister and veteran Congress leader Ashok Gehlot hit back at Shah.“I am not surprised to see that out of all opposition parties Mr Modi and Amit Shah are worried only about Congress. Their insecurities and fear is evident because everyone knows including Shah that only Congress under the leadership of Soniaji and Rahulji have the courage and strength to take on the tyranny of the current regime,” he said.“It is shocking that apart from 3/4 ministers, public does not even know who all are there in Modi’s cabinet.” Gehlot alleged that Shah along with Modi had hijacked the BJP and NDA government with no breather for other leaders, and were not fit to question “democratic values of Congress Party and CWC”. “It is no secret that for last three decades’ no one from the Gandhi family has held any position of power. They have always encouraged and empowered the cadre and ground worker of Congress party like me and if at all we are disconnected with public, why is Mr Shah so worried?” Gehlot added.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala tweeted, “And so spoke those, who occupied present positions by forcibly retiring & humiliating every patriarch & colleague who built them. And the list is long....Sh. L.K.Advani, Sh. M.M.Joshi, Sh. Keshubhai Patel, Sh. Kalraj Mishra, Smt. Sushma Swaraj, Sh. Haren Pandya, Sh. Sanjay Joshi.”Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and Rajya Sabha member Digvijaya Singh also questioned Shah’s statement and said the Congress party considers the Gandhi family as a binding force.“Who in Congress is opposed to Rahul ji or Priyanka ji? Name one senior leader? Whole Congress unitedly stands with Nehru Gandhi Family. They are the binding force. What is more important is the Ideological clarity among Congress leaders junior or senior which is harming the Party,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-cong-spar-on-45th-emergency-anniversary/story-bchbvPDNFwrPl3PyQkIF7N.html
26-06-2020||India||VVIP Chopper case: ED, CBI hunt for ‘real beneficiaries’||New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) are trying to tighten the noose around “real beneficiaries” of the alleged 70-million euro bribe paid in AgustaWestland scam, officials familiar with the development said. Wednesday’s raids on the premises of realty firm MGF’s managiong director Shravan Gupta by ED were focused on the money trail, which passes through several companies over a period of time, the officials said. The CBI is also set to soon file a charge sheet against five government officials and British middleman Christian Michel, for which it has already sought prosecution sanction from the government. Michel, a key accused in the case, was extradited to India from Dubai in December 2018. Officials in both ED and CBI said there will be “major developments” in the case in next couple of months. Shravan Gupta, who was the director of erstwhile Emaar MGF and was earlier questioned by ED in 2016, is under the scanner for appointment of another European middleman Guido Haschke as independent director in the company in 2009, an ED official familiar with the investigation said.“We have got some new leads in the case after which it was decided to raid seven places on Wednesday linked to Gupta and few other people. We are further investigating the real beneficiaries – politicians and bureaucrats – who got benefitted through certain businessmen and private companies,” said an ED officer requesting anonymity. Gupta, this officer said, is likely to be called for questioning soon. According to a second officer from ED, which has already filed multiple charge sheets in the case, kickbacks were made in India by the Anglo-Italian firm, AgustaWestland, through two sets of middlemen – Christian Michel James and Guido Ralph Haschke -- to influence a Rs 3,727 crore deal for 12 VVIP choppers. The kickbacks -- 12% of the deal, which amounts to roughly Euro 70 million, according to the exchange rate at the time -- was a quid pro quo to make the company eligible for the contract of AW-101 helicopters in 2010, the ED has contended. Meanwhile, the CBI, in its charge sheet filed in September 2017, also claimed that AgustaWestland’s competitor for the contract, M/s Sikorsky, quoted the price of around $506 (Rs 2,228 crores at the time) for 12 VVIP/non-VVIP helicopters, while AgustaWestland have quoted Euro 592 million (Rs 3966 crore). This was still approved by the Union government in 2010 with final cost negotiated at Rs 3,727 crore, the agency contended.Gupta or his spokesperson could not be reached for comments by HT. An email sent to MGF remained unanswered. Emaar India issued a statement on Wednesday saying Gupta has no role in the company. “Emaar and MGF had parted ways few years back and Mr Shravan Gupta has no role in Emaar India and is also no longer on the Board of the Company. Emaar India is directly under the control of its parent Emaar Properties PJSC, Dubai, and is fully in compliance with rules and regulations of the law of the land. As a responsible corporate, Emaar India will cooperate with any government agency.”Earlier, in a separate case pertaining to foreign exchange violations, ED seized Gupta’s assets worth Rs 10.28 crore in 2018 for allegedly holding undisclosed deposits in a Swiss bank account.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vvip-chopper-case-ed-cbi-hunt-for-real-beneficiaries/story-VfIv6ooi6foOcGuAhq2OwM.html
26-06-2020||India||Monsoon set in early, has covered most parts: IMD||The southwest monsoon has covered entire Delhi and advanced to most parts of the country, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Thursday, officially announcing the arrival of the rainy season in the national capital before its usual onset date of June 27.The monsoon arrived in Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) on Wednesday, as reported by HT, though scientists waited till Thursday for an official declaration because there was no rain until 8:30am on Wednesday, the threshold time for the measurement of precipitation.“Monsoon has already covered entire Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, most parts of Punjab, Chandigarh, Haryana and entire Delhi as on Thursday,” K Sathi Devi, head, National Weather Forecasting Centre, said.Cyclone Nisarga, which formed over the Arabian Sea on June 1 and coincided with the arrival of the rains in Kerala, helped the monsoon’s progress, Devi said. So did a low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal that formed around June 8.According to IMD, the monsoon is early over several states by at least a week. This is only the sixth time in the last 20 years that Delhi has seen monsoon arrive earlier than its expected date. In 2008, it arrived on June 15, and in 2013 on June 16.The monsoon arrived in India on June 1, and only parts of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana were untouched as of Thursday, according to scientists. Usually, the monsoon covers the entire country by July 8. Also, the monsoon has been 22% excess of long period average till June 24 this year.“Now, the monsoon trough is shifting northwards; so for three-four days, there will be very heavy and widespread rains in the eastern Himalayan foothills, Bihar and the northeastern states. There will be no rain in central India during this period and monsoon will advance very slowly. July and August are very important months for agriculture and we are expecting a favourable monsoon during those two months,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.A quicker expansion of the monsoon has spurred hopes of a rural sector-led economic recovery. The June-September monsoon is critical to agriculture and the wider economy. A poor monsoon hits incomes because agriculture employs nearly half of all Indians. The rains are a lifeline for about 60% of the country’s net cultivated area, which have no irrigation.The monsoon impacts inflation, jobs and industrial demand. Good farm output keeps a lid on food inflation. Ample harvests raise rural incomes and spending, helping inject demand into the economy. For instance, nearly half of all motorcycles and television sets in a year are sold to rural buyers. Such purchases keep demand in the manufacturing sectors ticking. Through April and May, sales of key inputs such as fertilizers were 74% higher than that in the corresponding months last year, official data show. As a pandemic-induced threat of recession stares down the Indian economy, the farm sector will be bright spot, growing at least 3% in 2020-21 on the back of good rains, according to a recent Niti Aayog assessment.“Agriculture should do well. But the nature of our crops is such that July rains count the most. Fingers crossed,” said Chinmay Gurjar, a former official of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-set-in-early-has-covered-most-parts-imd/story-Lc99a7RLQfSEfAO7RRyt0N.html

He added that the government is trying to contain the coronavirus pandemic as much as possible. Paul further said the coronavirus will take its own time till the so-called herd immunity is achieved, which happens when a large segment of the population has already been infected. “But we will not allow this virus to infect so many of us, that is the whole name of the game. “We will contain this disease to the maximum possible, we will push the peak and lower the peak as much as possible,” he said at the virtual launch of Covid-19 behavioural change campaign ‘Navigating the New Normal’. Paul, who is heading an Empowered Group on medical equipment and management plan to tackle the coronavirus outbreak, said the time is ripe for a mass movement for mask-wearing. “The behaviour and will of the people are at the heart of our fight against Covid-19,” he said, adding that how the country mitigates the risk of the coronavirus now depends on people’s actions. “If we create a barrier like a mask in the new normal, it would limit its spread,” Paul said. Speaking at the event, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said as the country continues to open up, there is higher expectation now than ever before from each Indian to practice safe behaviour. Lyricist and communications professional Prasoon Joshi said through this behavioural change campaign, the government envisions to make mask wearing a part of everyone’s subconscious and part of our everyday life. “The campaign to induce a behavioural change will be led by kids. As responsible citizens, we have to ensure that mask-wearing is an integral part of the new normal,” Joshi said. India registered its worst single-day increase in Covid-19 cases on Thursday, recording close to 17,000 coronavirus infections to push the overall tally to 4.73 lakh as the number of fatalities inched closer to 15,000, according to health ministry data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-of-people-at-heart-of-covid-19-fight-niti-aayog-s-v-k-paul/story-o5Ienr99QdqcglzxOhHO6N.html
26-06-2020||Editorials||This is not the time for politics||India is facing its most serious national security crisis since the Kargil conflict. Given that the stand-off this time is with China — a country with more resources, and arguably, superior military capabilities — the situation is particularly grave. And the fact that this external security threat has emerged at a time when India is battling a serious health and economic emergency makes it even more critical. This is not a business-as-usual situation; what citizens expect from the political class right now is a sense of responsibility and unity. Unfortunately, the accusations and counter-accusations between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government and the Congress reflect the opposite. The nature of these accusations is a particular cause for worry, since it is not just confined to the Opposition asking legitimate questions about the government’s handling of the issue or the government pointing to the legacies of the past. Both sides are effectively questioning each other’s patriotism.Both are to blame. The government was less-than-transparent about the Chinese aggression, which is now officially acknowledged as having started earlier than previously thought. It left the all-party meeting for too late, and even then, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s statement was ambiguous enough to require a subsequent clarification. For its part, the Congress, as a party which has been in power for decades, should be more understanding of national security imperatives, and stop making personal attacks on PM. The BJP has now accused the Congress of having presided over the spiralling trade deficit with China because China was a donor to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation. The optics of the donation are wrong and the foundation should not have taken financial support from Chinese government, but to suggest that is what led to a deliberate attempt to harm India’s economy is a stretch. Similarly, the Congress has accused the BJP of having close links with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). But to suggest that because party delegations have visited Beijing or interacted with CCP leaders, the BJP has compromised Indian interests is equally a stretch. The Congress has also launched an aggressive online political campaign, built around the theme of Indian soldiers; this is not the time for it. It is time for both the government and the Opposition to step back, have a quiet dialogue and present a united front publicly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/this-is-not-the-time-for-politics/story-JpMjZ0nMY7WprfQtKmnAvO.html
