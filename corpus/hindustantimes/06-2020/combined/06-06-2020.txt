India’s information technology (IT) industry and hundreds of thousands of H-1B visa holders in the US — a significant majority of whom are Indian nationals — heaved a huge sigh of relief: The proclamation did not eliminate the 65,000 H-1B visas for fiscal year 2021.However, H-1B workers, who number more than half a million, are not out of the woods yet. It is unlikely that they will be, till the economy picks up steam, or, at the very least, until all the ballots are counted after the presidential election on November 3.Some sort of restrictions could be imposed even within weeks. In the proclamation, Trump directed the secretaries of labour and homeland security to review various visa programmes and recommend appropriate measures, “and ensure the prioritisation, hiring, and employment of United States workers”.Even if no additional measures are implemented, the H-1B community is living in fear of job loss and the thought of having to leave the country. If the economy doesn’t turn the corner, anywhere from 20% to 25% of H-1B employees could lose their jobs, according to one estimate.Even if the gradual reopening of the economy results in some sort of recovery, there is no question the post-coronavirus pandemic terrain will be challenging for the Indian IT sector in the US. With the health care infrastructure overwhelmed by the pandemic and the economy in the middle of a recession, the upcoming presidential election, which is less than six months away, will be fought largely on these two issues. And jobs, 30 million of them having vanished, will be at the front and centre of the campaign for both sides.H-1B was a big target for Trump in 2016, who repeatedly criticised it during the presidential campaign. He once vowed to “end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labour programme”, and make it “an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration programme” without any exception.But once in power, Trump largely avoided talking about the H-1B programme. The one major action he took was an executive order signed just three months after swearing-in as the 45th president of the US. That was the “Buy American and Hire American” order, which directed federal agencies to “propose new rules and issue new guidance” to “protect the interests of” US workers.During the first three years of Trump’s presidency, the US economy created more than 6.5 million jobs, which weakened the argument that H-1B workers are depriving US citizens of jobs. But now, with more than 33 million jobs vanishing in less than three months, the voices of H-1B critics are resonating more than ever.With his management of the coronavirus pandemic diminishing his re-election prospects significantly, one shouldn’t be surprised if Trump returns to his 2016 self during the campaign.There is a big difference between then and now, however. In 2016, it was all rhetoric from an insurgent campaigner; now, being the president, he has the tools to implement what he preached four years ago.In the meantime, H-1B workers and the Indian IT industry should pray for the best but expect and be prepared for the worst.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-precarious-status-of-h-1b-visa-holders-in-the-us/story-HxHUHIKVJtFOfNTzZtFkbP.html
06-06-2020||News||Covid-19: Ensure prisons do not turn into a fertile ground for the virus||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has reached India’s prisons. With their high occupancy rates and inadequate healthcare facilities, this is a disaster in the making. Many states are reportedly affected, with 492 infections and two deaths. For example, Delhi has 17 cases of infection, Gujarat 14, Haryana two, Maharashtra 199, MP 19, Odisha one, Punjab one, Rajasthan 125 and UP 10.Since March, the Supreme Court (SC) and state authorities have taken measures to decongest prisons across the country. The National Legal Services Authority said in a recent report that more than 60,000 prisoners have been released since. However, with a prison population of over four lakhs, and new admissions every day, merely decongesting prisons is not enough. It is time to focus on the conditions inside prisons.The hygiene and sanitation facilities in custodial institutions tend to be poor. The Model Prison Manual 2016 prepared by the ministry of home affairs recommends one toilet per ten inmates during the night and one for six during the day. (During lock-out times, prisoners are allowed to come out of their barracks for washing, bathing and fresh air). Reality, however, is far from this. The lack of enough bathrooms, water supply, and soap for bathing and washing are some of the reasons for the lack of overall hygiene in our prisons. These gaps, coupled with poor health care facilities, make prisons a fertile ground for the virus.While facilities are inadequate, the lack of institutional staff despite posts being available means that effective implementation of anti-virus precautions in prisons is very difficult. The India Justice Report 2019, which analysed government data across four pillars of the criminal justice system (police, prisons, legal aid and the judiciary), indicated vacancies at between 30-40% in the institutional staff. As Covid-19-positive cases rise across prisons, state governments must urgently appoint additional staff, especially caretaking and medical, on a contractual basis.Functionaries within the justice system are rarely trained to handle disaster and emergency situations, making prisons all the more vulnerable. This necessitates the deployment of adequately-trained civil defence teams. These teams can effectively assist prison administrators in implementing prescribed sanitation plans as advised by health departments and other agencies. Additionally, each prison should constitute a nodal medical committee to monitor the jail’s response to positive and suspected cases of Covid-19 among prisoners and staff, and to conduct contact tracing.It is equally important that prisoners’ fundamental rights are protected – such as proper medical care, clean and hygienic surroundings, adequate diet, clean bedding and clothing, communication with family and friends, and effective legal representation.We suggest the following steps to combat the spread of the pandemic within jails. One, prisons must ensure weekly visits by doctors. Two, all wards, barracks and common areas must be cleaned daily with water and disinfectant. Three, thermal thermometers should be supplied to monitor visitors and staff, and washbasins and hand wash facilities placed at entry and exit points. Four, additional mobile toilets should be set up (if required) as well as drinking and bathing water facilities augmented by water tankers. Five, sufficient supply of bathing and washing soaps as well as sanitary pads should be provided to women prisoners. Six, an improved diet must be provided to pregnant women, lactating mothers and children in prisons. Seven, a supply of cloth masks or gamchas and sanitisers for and prison staff must be ensured. Eight, new admissions to the prison should be screened and kept in an isolation ward for 14 days.In a bid to check infections being inadvertently spread during prison visits, several states have placed a ban on visits by families and legal representatives. However, a few have made alternative arrangements for communication, providing telephone or video-calling facilities. The ministry of home affairs, in its May 2, 2020 advisory, too, had emphasised that “the facility of mulaqats, i.e., meeting between the prisoners and their family members, should be stopped till the pandemic is controlled. Video Conference and phone calls between inmates and his family members should be allowed.”It’s natural for prisoners to be anxious about their family’s well-being. Prison administrators must ensure the availability of at least some mode of communication. It is also important to allow phone calls with prisoners’ lawyers to help them get a sense of the status of their case or bail application.Prison administrations must take steps to reduce stress levels among prisoners as well as prison staff. A dedicated helpline facility for e-counselling services may be set up in coordination with the health department. Legal services authorities or non-governmental organisations working in the area may be requested to organise awareness camps or recreation sessions via video.Concerted efforts must be made to mitigate the dangers of the pandemic’s spread among the custodial population. Governments must affirm their commitment to safeguard the rights of prisoners as well as prison staff, and take affirmative steps to ensure their safety and well-being.

06-06-2020||Mumbai||Cyclone Nisarga:Two NDRF officers suffer serious injuries; 7 teams deployed in Shrivardhan taluka||Two officers of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) suffered serious injuries during clearing work in the aftermath of Cyclone Nisarga, at two separate locations along the Konkan coast on Saturday morning. The first case was at Shrivardhan taluka in Raigad, where Inderjeet Singh Chauhan accidentally cut all his five toes and a portion of his foot while using a mechanical tree cutter and had to be rushed to the Shrivardhan government hospital, said officers. “He was given first aid at the government hospital. The amputated portion of his foot was kept in an ice-box. The officer was then rushed to Breach Candy Hospital in Mumbai, where he reached at 5pm. A team of orthopaedic, vascular and plastic surgeons were ready there to conduct a surgery. The operation will take six hours,” said Mahesh Nalawade, deputy commandant, NDRF.Presently, there are four NDRF teams at Shrivardhan taluka. Another two from Murud and one from Alibag were diverted for additional operations on Saturday as it is the worst affected taluka in the district.The second incident took place in Dapoli, Ratnagiri, where an officer suffered serious injuries during road clearance duty when an electric pole fell on his head. “The officer was wearing a helmet and the impact was not directly on his head. However, due to the sudden hit, his forehead dashed against the road and he received a serious injury,” said another NDRF official requesting anonymity. “He is stable and is under constant supervision,” he added. Following the incidents, all NDRF teams on duty were issued an advisory that read, “All the commanders and rescuers need to be more alert and vigilant while on work. Unnecessary injury while being casual or by accident need to be avoided. So all are requested and directed to be more careful and alert while performing such risky jobs.”On March 31, seven NDRF teams had arrived in Raigad district in view of the cyclone Nisarga. Each team has 23 members. They first ensured the safe relocation and evacuation of citizens living along the coast, followed by awareness sessions, and finally post-cyclone restoration efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cyclone-nisarga-two-ndrf-officers-suffer-serious-injuries-7-teams-deployed-in-shrivardhan-taluka/story-HLA0U6jCyDSLX3TKqZbDYN.html

The MC had earlier applied for permission with the deputy commissioner’s office and also sought guidelines from the administration before resuming the service.The officials said buses would be run with 50% occupancy and the contractor would be directed to sanitise the buses on a daily basis. An MC official, requesting anonymity, said the contractor is, however, reluctant to run the buses citing losses. The contractor has also asked the MC to revise the fare as the buses would be run at 50% occupancy and the transport is also expected to receive low response.MC additional commissioner Sanyam Aggarwal said, “The MC has received permission to resume the city bus service and it is expected to run the service from the next week. The buses would be run at 50% occupancy and the sanitisation process would be taken up on a daily basis.”The service was put to halt after the imposition of curfew in the state on March 23. After the government had allowed buses to operate in the state, the MC had also sought permission to run the city bus service. Before curfew, the service was being run on four routes in the city and suspension of this facility affected over 3,500 daily passengers. As many as 65 buses were plying on four routes, including Sahnewal to Clock Tower, Kohara to the bus stand, Dugri to the Metro supermarket and the railway station to Meharban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/city-bus-service-in-ludhiana-likely-to-resume-next-week/story-c4mZeozL9yxsPbsDSg59jI.html

06-06-2020||Delhi||Federation of the blind condemns DU’s decision to conduct online exams||The National Federation of the Blind on Saturday condemned the Delhi University’s decision to conduct an online open-book examination (OBE) for final-year students from July 1, stating that visually challenged students were more vulnerable during a pandemic as they relied on their sense of touch.The federation has also filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court challenging the varsity’s decision. The matter is listed for a hearing on June 9. They are seeking directions to promote specially abled students based on their previous performances or to conduct offline exams a week after the university reopens and give equal weightage to the internal assessment as well as the exams.Last week, DU had announced that it will conduct online exams in the OBE format for all final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students as a one-time measure in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.SK Rungta, the general secretary of the federation, said that the decision to conduct exams amid a pandemic would pose a health risk to students. “Scribes may not be available for blind students or others; they might be afraid for their lives and/or want to adhere to social distancing norms,” he said.He added that since students had gone home during the semester break, many did not have their reading material on hand. “They do not have the necessary devices with them nor the required infrastructure for the exam,” Rungta said. The federation came to this conclusion after surveying 150 students “who unanimously expressed their inability to participate in the exam.”Dean, examinations, Vinay Gupta said that students enrolled under the persons with disability category will be given five hours to complete their exam instead of the three prescribed for others. Through a notification, he directed colleges, faculties, and departments to help students arrange scribes. For those special students who are unable to take the online exams in July, DU will give them another opportunity—in pen and paper mode—once they return to the campus, the administration had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/federation-of-the-blind-condemns-du-s-decision-to-conduct-online-exams/story-vN3AINZtnWkthBGRG5T62O.html
06-06-2020||Chandigarh||Dr Inderjeet Singh joins as vice-chancellor of Ludhiana vet varsity||Punjab’s director of animal husbandry, Dr Inderjeet Singh, joined as the vice-chancellor of Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU), Ludhiana, on Saturday.He is replacing Dr AS Nanda whose four-year tenure ended on February 15, 2019. However, he continued to occupy the position on ad-hoc basis as the government had not decided on his successor.Dr Singh will take formal charge of the university on Monday. The Punjab government had formed a search and screening committee headed by the chief secretary to select the new V-C in January.The decision to appoint Dr Singh as the new V-C was taken in a meeting of senior functionaries, including chief secretary and principal secretary, animal husbandry, on Thursday. Dr Singh is a native of Haryana and joined Punjab’s animal husbandry department as director in 2018.

06-06-2020||Mumbai||Monsoon arrival expected around June 11, says IMD||The arrival of the southwest monsoon can be expected over the city next week close to its new normal onset date of June 11, the weather bureau said.As a low-pressure area (weather system) develops over the Bay of Bengal around June 8, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said it will enhance rainfall activity over the coast, especially the Konkan region, including Mumbai.“Based on examples witnessed in previous years, and our weather models, when a low-pressure system develops over the Bay of Bengal, it leads to rainfall activity over the west coast due to changing wind patterns and increased moisture incursions. It is a positive development as it will allow the further advancement of monsoon, and most probably it will meet its new normal onset date of June 11 for Mumbai,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD.Last month, IMD revised its normal onset date for major cities across India and declared that the arrival would be delayed by a day (from June 10 to June 11) and withdrawal date by nine days (from September 29 to October 8). This means the southwest monsoon is likely to have an extended stay for eight days from this year onwards, according to IMD.Independent meteorologists were divided over the possible monsoon onset date.Sridhar Balasubramanian, associate professor, department of mechanical engineering and associate faculty, IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) explained that due to the system over the Bay of Bengal, an offshore trough (weather system due to strong wind currents) would form along with a possible cyclonic circulation (a stream of air flowing at higher altitudes) in the Arabian Sea, close to Gujarat.“Heavy rains to the tune of 90-100 mm is generally seen over Mumbai. Given these dynamics, June 12 is likely onset over Mumbai followed by some heavy rains anytime between June 13 and 15,” said Balasubramanian adding that the offshore trough will extend from Mumbai to Kerala coasts. “Hence, the west coast will generally see heavy rains between June 10 and 15. The heavy rain window for states will be different given the strength of offshore trough. For eg Kerala and coastal Karnataka are likely to see heavy rains between June 10-12. Goa and Ratnagiri belt (south Konkan) may see heavy rains between June 11-13.”Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, UK said several models were suggesting that monsoon would reach Konkan and Mumbai between June 14 and 16. “Proper rainfall is expected to commence in Mumbai from around 12 June. Arrival over interior Maharashtra is expected through the week starting June 15.”Private weather forecasters Skymet said onset was expected between June 12 and 13.Meanwhile, the IMD also released the lifecycle of Cyclone Nisarga that battered several areas of the Maharashtra coast, and its final trajectory ending up over parts of southeast Uttar Pradesh and adjoining Bihar as a low-pressure system. This was the first time IMD issued a ‘pre-cyclone watch’ at 2 pm on May 31, at the stage when the weather system was a low-pressure area, 80 hours before the landfall as a severe cyclonic storm. “This was the first time in history where we went a step ahead and issued a cyclone warning to both states before the system developed into depression or deep depression, which is our standard operating procedure. It gave both Maharashtra and Gujarat a day more than usual to prepare for its arrival,” said Mohapatra adding that the very first information about the system was provided on May 29, three days before the formation of a significant system.Monitored using observations from various satellites, ships, and buoys (instruments which collect weather and ocean data), IMD provided three-hourly bulletins from June 1 to 2, and hourly bulletins on June 3 and 4, including rainfall, wind warnings, affected districts, location of the system, expected property damage, storm surge, and location of landfall.‘If the location of landfall was more accurate, the response would have been faster’Though the cyclone brushed past Mumbai not causing much damage to the financial capital, the extent of damage was witnessed along southern talukas of Raigad district. While the extent of landfall area, as per IMD’s prediction, ranged from Daman, south Gujarat to Harihareshwar in Raigad, the forecast till 5am, June 3 read landfall would be ‘close to Alibag’. This allowed necessary responsive measures within that area. However, at 10 am June 3, the location was slightly altered to the south of Alibag, forcing a sudden change in responsive measures. Landfall took place at 12.30 pm near Diveagar between Shrivardhan and Murud, south of Alibag but the extent of damages in these areas were only identified three days after landfall as authorities were unable to reach these areas. Deoras said the landfall process as per the radar commenced around 10am, but IMD’s 12pm bulletin expected it to start during 1230 and 1pm. “In reality, most of the process had finished by 1pm,” he said.Mohapatra countered stating that the landfall site was accurate as per the large area provided (from Harihareshwar to Daman). “Even the wind speed after landfall was as predicted. It is a dynamic system and can change dramatically closer to land. However, as in the case of Mumbai, it was better to have heightened safety measures than witnessing losses,” he said.“The landfall hit regions in Raigad district such as Diveagar will also witness proper rainfall from around June 12. This is likely to cause more inconvenience and disruptions in the rehabilitation process,” Deoras added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/monsoon-arrival-expected-around-june-11-says-imd/story-8DmQ7zzZXEzLLU0P80WdtN.html

06-06-2020||City||Slums situated behind Ludhiana’s Central Jail a threat to its security: Authorities||Inmates of the Central Jail here seem to have an easy access to mobile phones. As many as 16 mobiles were recovered from them in the past one week raising a question mark on the working of jail authorities.The phones have been recovered even when courts are closed as the courts used to be the places where they managed to get mobiles secretly when they were brought there for hearings.According to jail officials, slums behind the jail have become a threat for the security of the jail. They said accomplices of inmates are suspected of throwing mobile phones and other contraband over the compound wall of the prison. Therefore, we have already asked the district authorities to shift the slums from there to other places.Jail superintendent Rajiv Arora said, “Inmates don’t hesitate to hide mobile phones in their private parts as well. Some inmates have even carved cavities in the floor of barracks and bathrooms to hide mobiles. Some mobiles were recovered from garbage dumps also.”The jail has 2,500 inmates. Earlier, there were a total of 3,400 inmates. As many as 800 inmates were shifted to other jails due to the outbreak of coronavirus.“The jail compound covers over 100 acres of land and we are conducting patrolling the entire day with the help of CRPF jawans and jail security guards. We have recovered contrabands thrown over the wall of the jail by the accused, who manage to hide in the slums,” said the superintendent.On June 2, the Jail officials have recovered 15 mobile phones from the jail and lodged an FIR against eight inmates.One June 3, the officials recovered one mobile phone and 32 packets of tobacco alongside the compound wall of the jail. The contrabands were thrown over the compound wall.Earlier on April 8, 14 mobile phones were recovered from the jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/slums-situated-behind-ludhiana-s-central-jail-a-threat-to-its-security-authorities/story-5CNTc814fe6wpiXLRIRLmK.html

Not only has he served cooked meals and dry rations to migrant workers, but also ensured their safe departure by Shramik Special trains in April and May, even if it required giving 10-15 hours a day. Bajaj was recently appreciated as an unsung hero by the district administration for his selfless work. “Rakesh Bajaj, a 39 year old man who lost his job during Covid-19 lockdown. He is heading a team of 9 volunteers of QRT with MCG. Never asked for a leave and giving 15 hours a day in the record breaking heat,” the deputy commissioner’s office said in a tweet on May 28.At present, about 500 volunteers are helping the district administration deal with the Covid-19 crisis.Having spent more than a decade in Gurugram working as supervisor with different companies, Bajaj’s last job was with a construction company where he handled workers and labourers at the construction site. Like others, Bajaj could not comprehend the criticality of the situation when Janta Curfew was imposed on March 22. “Till that time, we had no idea that we are heading towards a situation which can cost my job, and leave many people helpless,” said Bajaj. As all the work came to a halt due to the nationwide lockdown and workers started leaving for their native towns, the construction site where Bajaj worked was also shut. His employer asked him to stay at home and gave some money. “I had sufficient saving. I knew that I could sustain for three-four months,” said Bajaj.The situation, however, made him think of construction workers who were dependent on daily wages for survival. A few days after he was laid off, a WhatsApp message circulated by the administration regarding the requirement of volunteers reached Bajaj. “The decision was easy. I applied for it. Everything was in the nascent stage at the time. I was asked to distribute cooked meals at that time,” he said. “I believe if you can’t help people with money then there are other ways to end their plight,” he said, calling these words of his mother, who is a retired school teacher. Bajaj, who has a 12 -year-old son and a 65-year-old mother in the family, devoted almost 15 hours a day to help the needy. He, along with his team of nine volunteers of quick response team, was assigned the duty to provide cooked meals to workers, not only those who were leaving the city but also those who stayed back. Reminiscing some of the moments while working as volunteer, Bajaj said, “It was heart wrenching to see migrants huddled under Rajiv Chowk flyover. Around midnight, we reached there with food, glucose and water to help them. But we couldn’t stop them from moving as they were prepared to walk a distance of 700 kilometres. Every day I watched kids walking with their families, unware of the miles they had to cover.”He was later assigned the duty to ensure proper food supply to people, who were leaving by special trains. “For the past few weeks, since Shramik Special trains started, I was stationed at Tau Devi Lal Stadium in the first half of the day, managing registration of people to their departure via buses to the railway station. Then coordinating with the team to ensure that the migrants get food and water before leaving,” he said. Bajaj now hopes to be able to get job with the lockdown lifting while continuing to volunteer for as long as required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-who-lost-job-due-to-lockdown-now-serves-district-admin-as-volunteer/story-bZOaEogUCdreOgzAKBEwwM.html

06-06-2020||City||UP-Rera hands over unfinished housing project on Yamuna Expressway to allottees||The Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UP-Rera), on Saturday, decided to hand over an abandoned residential project in Greater Noida to its welfare association and appoint a construction consultant.Rajive Kumar, Chairman, UP-Rera, issued an order stating: “The registration of Project ‘Sampada Livia’ (UPRERAPRJ5855) of M/s PSA Impex Pvt. Ltd was revoked in September 2019 under Section 7 of Rera Act. The grounds were non-compliance under Section 4 and 11 of Rera Act, and Rule 14 of UP-Rera Rules, delays in development of the project, fraud and corrupt practices by the promoter and diversion of funds collected from the allottees.”The project has 726 units, of which 355 units have been sold by the original promoter. A project advisory and monitoring committee was constituted on December 6, 2019, under the chairmanship of Balvinder Kumar, member, UP-Rera to oversee the development of the project under the provisions of Section 8 of the Rera Act. UP-Rera issued a public notice on December 7, 2019, calling upon the association of allottees to submit a viable proposal for taking up the remaining development work of the project.“SLB Welfare Association, the association of allottees of the project, comprising over 50% membership of allottees, submitted a proposal to take up the remaining development of the project.,”said Kumar.“After a careful examination of the association’s proposal and the powers conferred under Section 8 of the Rera Act, the Authority has decided to give its approval on authorising the SLB Welfare Association to step in and complete the remaining development, along with the right to undertake the sale of unsold units for mobilising funds for the same,” said Kumar.The action taken by UP-Rera is a monumental step towards completing stuck and abandoned projects in Gautam Budh Nagar. The order is estimated to benefit at least 355 allottees of the project.“To ensure transparency and accountability, UP-Rera will be appointing a project management consultant to monitor the completion progress of the project,” said Kumar.Dr Akansha Aggarwal, president SLB Welfare Association, said, “Several NOC of various departments have expired and also we will have to execute the builder-buyer agreements afresh and hire technical team and construction consultant. This process will take around six months. Thereafter, we will be able to start the construction and complete the project in 4 years in three phases. Presently only 10% of project is completed. Since 2015 there is no construction at site. The builder is in jail.”The project has 10 towers having 25 floors each. Civil structure in six towers has been completed up to 6 to 8 floors. In one tower only basement has been dug up. Work on remaining three towers work is yet to start,” said Aggarwal.“In our proposal submitted in January we had give cost of completion of project as ₹243.59 crores and estimated date of completion as February 4, 2024,” said Aggarwal.The audit report by M/s Currie & Brown Pvt Ltd had reported diversion of funds of ₹47 crore by the builder. “This is breach of trust of allottees and amounts to a criminal offence,” said Abrar Ahmed, secretary, UP-Rera.“The project is located on the Yamuna Expressway. Out of total 726 sanctioned flats, total saleable area is 10,22,790 square feet and out of which 46% or 4,72,495 square feet has already been sold by builder,”said Ahmed.“Total receivable from sold and unsold units is about ₹233.50 crore and receivable from commercial units sale is ₹6.40 crore,” said Ahmed.The association has to submit resolution by June 25 signed by more than 50% of allottees of the project.The Association will also have the freedom to determine the sale price of the unsold units and it can also renegotiate price with existing allottees.A representative of Sampda Livia representative said, “On getting the order copy, we will take legal opinion and challenge the order in front of higher authority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-rera-hands-over-unfinished-housing-project-on-yamuna-expressway-to-allottees/story-ymsZh8tLVLMEEQu4hVywHJ.html
06-06-2020||City||Rising cases and number of deaths leave health department officials worried||Ghaziabad on Saturday recorded a surge in number of Covid cases, adding 44 new cases to its overall tally that breached the 400 mark.Officials said that till Saturday , Ghaziabad had recorded a total of 442 cases, with 297 patients being cured till date and nine deaths being reported so far. There were at present 136 active cases in the district.“At least 11 of the 44 patients reported positive on Saturday were already admitted to Covid hospitals. The remaining 33 too were in quarantine and will be shifted to Covid hospitals. The death toll stands at nine till date,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO) of the district.The officials said that five cases on Saturday were from Vaishali, four from Khoda, four from Muradnagar, four from Indirapuram and three from Crossings Republik . They added that the other cases were from media houses, a head constable from Indirapuram police station and one staff of MMG Hospital.According to official records, the first Covid case was reported on March 5 and the figure slowly reached 50 cases on April 22, after about 48 days. The next 50 cases were reported by May 5 in a span of about 13 days.The next 50 cases (total case count 150) happened in another 10 days on May 15 while the district crossed the 200 mark on May 21 in another six days. However, the next 100 cases arrived in just 10 days with the district crossing the 300 cases mark on May 31.The next 100 cases have arrived in a span of just six days and the total on June 6 stood at 442.Though the district has recorded nine deaths due to the virus till June 6, the officials of the district health department said that only three have so far taken in Ghaziabad hospital. The others were added to the district’s list from Meerut.“We have only three deaths which have taken place in Ghaziabad . The Meerut officials are not cross-notifying us and we did not refer these patients here. The patients themselves went to Meerut and also turned positive before they succumbed to medical conditions. The Meerut officials are now uploading these deaths to the online government portal ,” CMO Dr NK Gupta, said.He added that two deaths — of a man from Loni and a woman from Jhandapur — had taken place in Delhi earlier. Of the nine deaths added to Ghaziabad’s tally, three took place in Ghaziabad, four in Meerut and one each at Noida and Delhi.“So, we expect that the patients who died in Delhi will also be added to our tally and the toll will rise in the coming days. Seven of nine deaths (added to Ghaziabad’s tally) which have taken place are related to patients who suffered from diabetes. One patient suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, while one other had respiratory distress. So far they cannot be termed as deaths due to Corona. It may have acted as a catalyst and speed up their comorbid conditions. The death audit report of all patients is awaited,” CMO added.Dr Raj Kumar, the chief medical officer of Meerut district said that any patient from Ghaziabad who dies will be added to the tally of Ghaziabad.“If patient comes for treatment to Meerut and dies, we will be adding them to the tally of Ghaziabad district since they were original residents of Ghaziabad,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rising-cases-and-number-of-deaths-leave-health-department-officials-worried/story-ymYZsjxiUfYtXG4aiwJbhM.html
06-06-2020||City||35-year-old man booked for duping woman, concealing marital status||A 35-year-old man and four of his relatives were booked by Bisrakh police for allegedly hiding his marital status from a woman he married last year and then threatening and duping her.The complaint was filed by the 28-year-old woman who only came to know about the suspect’s first marriage last month.“Just before the lockdown, the suspect told my sister that one of his brothers back home was not well and he will have to go back to his home town Azamgarh. He said he would be working there from home. However, for the last few days, he had been dodging her calls and messages. On May 26, a woman, whom he had first introduced as his sister-in-law, picked up her call and told her not to call anymore as she was his real wife,” the woman’s sister said.The woman, who runs a boutique, then went to her house in a high-rise in Greater Noida West, barely 500 metres away from where she lived herself, and confronted them after which she found out about the man’s first marriage. The man, who works as a software engineer with a Noida-based firm, had already been married for at least 13 years and even had two daughters, said the woman’s family.“One of the suspects’ brothers knew my family and he introduced my sister to him after which they got married last year. His family hid his marital status from us, and when she found out the first marriage, some of his relatives even assaulted her and threatened her of dire consequences,” said the sister. “In the last one year, the suspect used my sister to get a gold loan and even pay the instalments of a personal loan. He used her financially and emotionally. She even had to undergo two abortions because he said didn’t want to have children,”Following the woman’s complaint, a case was registered at the Bisrakh police station against the man and his four relatives under sections 147, 323, 495, 504, 506, and 498A of the Indian Penal Code.“The suspect had been detained initially when the matter was brought to us, but the victim’s family didn’t want to pursue legal action then. The official police complaint was lodged later on June 1, and currently, all the suspects are on the run and a search is on for them,” said Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police, women safety.The police said action can also be taken against the suspect’s first wife who appears to be a part of the fraud, but the woman had not named her in the police complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/35-year-old-man-booked-for-duping-woman-concealing-marital-status/story-FySFdaMWDanftQyQ5JLd0L.html
06-06-2020||Noida||Helpline, Google form launched to track testing details, containment zone plans||Gautam Budh Nagar district has launched a helpline to aid those who conduct Covid-19 tests from private labs. It also released an online link through which residents can send in queries about containment zone plans in certain sectors. Residents have been complaining that the administration is not sharing details of Covid-19 cases in their neighbourhood and the implementation of containment zone provisions was delayed.According to the new plan, if a patient has done her test from a private lab, then she can call on the helpline number 18004192211 to communicate to health officials the details of her test if it is positive for Covid-19. The health officials will then confirm the results with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and then include the case in the Covd count of the district for further action. “If any person gets tested from a private lab, then (s)he must inform us about the results and we will then confirm the report from ICMR before factoring it into our count. With the helpline, this task will become smoother. Our medical team will do the needful,” Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.Apart from this helpline, the administration has also started an online grievance system using Google forms. One can log on to https://bit.ly/3h3kLHE to access the form. Residents can submit their queries related to Covid-19 issues, containment zone queries, sanitisation queries,and even non-Covid health queries on the Google form. A person can submit their mobile phone number, address and the query on the form and get the issues addressed.“We will address all grievances of citizens via this portal. All queries -- be it related to Covid-19 or not -- will get addressed without any hassle. Residents can also get instant information about probable containment zone plan in their area and take needful precautions,” the DM said.Residents had earlier alleged that authorities were a little late in implementing a containment zone plan even after cases are detected in a particular area.“We have demanded that an area must be sealed and made into containment zone with proper coordination with RWAs or social groups. If this portal will work out well, then it will be useful to all residents,” NP Sing, president of district development RWAs (DDRWA), a residents’ umbrella body, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/helpline-google-form-launched-to-track-testing-details-containment-zone-plans/story-AzBe7Wd8v3eDBF618hyP1N.html
06-06-2020||City||Ghaziabad may switch from sector scheme to containment zones in Khoda, Loni and Vaishali||The Ghaziabad health department has started working on a plan to relax restrictions in the three sealed areas of Khoda, Loni and Vaishali based on the emergence of cases in last 21 days and will focus more on containment zones. The officials of the health department said that recommendation will soon be given to the district magistrate to ease restrictions in the areas..The three areas of Khoda, Loni and Vaishali have been placed under the sector scheme since May 10, May 27 and June 1 respectively, with around 8-10 lakh people living in the three localities having their movements restricted to contain the spread of Covid-19.“Our teams are closely monitoring areas in Khoda, Loni and Vaishali. We plan to maintain category 1 and category 2 containment zones. In case any locality in these three areas has had no cases in the last 21 days, we will recommend its opening. Otherwise, the areas will remain as containment zones. A plan is being chalked out and a report will be submitted to the district magistrate, who will take the final call,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of the district.The officials said that category 1 containment are those where a single case has emerged and entitles sealing of a radius of 250 metres. Category 2 containment zones are those where more than one cases have emerged and requires a sealing of at least 500 metres radius with an additional area of 200 metres as buffer zone.Once sealed, only essential activities and people are allowed inside containment zones. There is strict perimeter control and no movement of residents is allowed except for medical emergencies or purchasing/maintaining essential supplies.“Residents in these areas want relaxation in overall sealing as the local economy of the area and jobs of locals have taken a hit. There is no point in sealing and also maintaining containment zones inside the sealed locality. Maintaining containment zones, where fresh cases have occurred, is a better idea,” said Mohit Sharma, resident of sector-1, Vaishali.Ghaziabad district till June 5 had recorded 398 positive cases of Covid-19 with 271 patients discharged and nine deaths so far.According to official records, Khoda accounted for about 58 (four fresh cases on Saturday) cases, including 14 before the sealing was done. Likewise, Loni has 35 cases (no fresh cases), with 21 before the area was placed under sealing. Vaishali on the other hand was subjected to sealing only on June 1 and has a total of 41 cases (five fresh) with 34 emerging before the sealing.Overall, the three localities placed under sealing account for about 31% of total cases in the district. The administration on June 5 had claimed that Khoda was reporting 18% positive cases before the sealing. The number dropped to 12% after the sealing.They had added that Loni’s cases reduced from 10% to 7% while those in Vaishali reduced from 28% to 5% after sector scheme was implemented. However, no corresponding figures of positive cases and number of sampling were provided.“The relaxation in sealing is being reviewed by a committee, led by the chief medical officer. They will submit a report and recommendations,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.The officials said that district till June 5 has 105 containment zones, including 85 in category 1.CMO Gupta also maintained that cases have continued to come in on regular basis from Khoda, Loni and Vaishali.“In Khoda and Loni we have contained the spread of Covid-19 infection, else it would have resulted in hundreds of new cases being reported daily considering the density of population. Vaishali has also received with only two casesbeing reported after sealing,” CMO added.Khoda’s executive office KK Bhadana said, “We have three major areas in Khoda from where majority of cases have come. We are hopeful that the district magistrate will review the sealing. People in Khoda have already been under lockdown for about two months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-may-switch-from-sector-scheme-to-containment-zones-in-khoda-loni-and-vaishali/story-EbuFAUGDeWsrlXL4WNDt1I.html

After we reopen, I expect to get only 10-20% of the nearly 500 customers that we served a day before the lockdown, through dine-in, takeaway and home delivery.” He said they will stay closed for a week or two, as they will only lose money if they reopened.Owner of Sindhi Sweets, Neeraj Bajaj, who is also the president of Chandigarh Business Council, said all restaurant owners were united over the rent disagreement, and will utilise this time to renovate their premises before reopening.As per the SOP, cinema halls and game arcades will remain closed for now.While refusing to comment on the rent issue, the official spokesperson of the mall said, “Elante will open its doors to public on the June 8 as per notification issued by the Chandigarh administration. Elante, home to over 200 brands, will be open from 10am and operate till 8pm. We are absolutely thrilled to welcome all our patrons, whilst ensuring social distancing norms are strictly implemented. While we are confident that all our partners will smoothly resume operations, we also anticipate the re-opening to be a gradual process as SOPs are understood and get adhered to 100%.”BOXHeadline: Steps taken for visitors’ safetySpecialised cameras will check crowdingVisitors need to install and show Aarogya Setu app before being allowed entry to the mallAll washrooms have been equipped with contactless taps and soap dispensersOnly a limited number of people will be allowed on elevators or in stores at a given time||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/elante-opens-on-june-8-but-you-will-have-to-wait-to-dine-in/story-ckKceVXBzVqJmBhe4zp2XO.html

Police said the incident took place in the afternoon when the victim was alone at home.“I got a phone call that my brother had been killed. My husband and I reached the spot and found Ramesh’s half-burnt body was lying on the ground. A bottle of wine was also present in the room. It appeared as if the accused had killed my brother before setting him afire to destroy the evidence. His cellphone and wallet were also missing,” said the victim’s sister Saloni, who lives in a nearby locality.She alleged that three persons, who often came to meet her brother, had committed the crime.Station house officer Anil Kumar said, “It appears that the accused first stabbed him in the neck with some sharp weapon and then set him on fire.”He said the police were trying to ascertain the identity of the accused. A case of murder has been being registered against unidentified suspects, the cop added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/disabled-man-stabbed-to-death-set-ablaze-in-amritsar/story-gGCOT62g7YY1M1jVjnA2QN.html

Shramiko ko samman nahin de sakhtey, toh apmaan kyon (Have shame Nitish Kumar. If you can’t give dignity to labourers, why are insulting them?),” read the posters while taking a dig at the state machinery for dubbing the migrants as criminals.Later, Yadav issued a statement and appealed to all RJD workers to publicise the contents of the letter in a bid to expose the anti-migrant attitude of the state government.“All the workers should put up posters of this letter in their neighbourhoods, panchayats, at block and district level to expose the state government’s anti-migrant streak,” he said.On Friday, Yadav had slammed the state government for issuing such a letter. He had alleged that it was an insult to lakhs of migrants who have returned to their native state and are facing an acute financial crisis because of the Covid-19-induced job losses.The RJD has been hitting out at the state government over the return of lakhs of migrants from various states in the past month, claiming it reflected how the 15-year tenure of CM Kumar had failed in generating jobs for Bihar’s working-class population. The party also blamed the government for its failure to organise an adequate number of trains to bring back stranded migrants from Bihar on time.Political experts are of the opinion that the RJD’s aggressive stand on job creation for migrant workers and their socio-economic rehabilitation is a calibrated strategy to tap the vote bank among the returnees in the run-up to the assembly polls slated to be held in October-November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/rjd-puts-up-posters-asks-nitish-kumar-why-are-migrants-in-bihar-being-insulted/story-LpkvoYbX0j4pNSWzvhboHI.html

Thereafter, we went to a hospital in Sector 30 (the Child PGI), from there we went to the Sharda Hospital and then to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida. But all refused to admit her,” the man is seen alleging in a video circulating on social media.He said the family also tried to get admission in the private facility Jaypee, Fortis Hospital in Gautam Buddh Nagar and Max in Vaishali, Ghaziabad, but were allegedly told that no beds were available.“Kul mila ke humari ambulance mein hi death ho gayi (ultimately, she died in the ambulance). Finally, we got to the GIMS where she was put on a ventilator but it was too late,” he said.  Gautam Buddh Nagar District Magistrate Suhas L Y ordered a probe into the episode.“Additional DM Munindra Nath Upadhyay and Chief Medical Officer Deepak Ohri will probe the matter. The DM has instructed them to immediately carry out a probe and take action,” an official statement said.This is at least the second instance within a fortnight when a life has been lost in Gautam Buddh Nagar due to unavailability of timely medical treatment.  On the night of May 25, a newborn child had died due to lack of medical support as his father kept running from one hospital to another between Greater Noida and Noida.The district administration had carried out a probe in that matter too and pinned the fault on two private hospitals for alleged negligence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/pregnant-woman-dies-in-ambulance-after-running-between-hospitals-for-13-hours/story-YnD7Sacy0FfuaGgrukWPVM.html

Representatives of RWAs from various sectors, including Sectors 9, 10 and 15, were present. We were told that only those people should employ maids who can arrange for their stay in their homes.” However, there are a few exceptions, such as Sector 12, where entry of domestic helps has been allowed following the Centre’s Unlock plan this month.Meanwhile, domestic helps are at the receiving end. Sakina, who worked in a number of households in a Panchkula locality, is jobless for three months, and is left with no money to run her household. Searching for work, she daily makes calls or knocks on the doors of a few houses. Yet, nothing has worked out for her yet. Some societies don’t even let her enter the gate.Similar is the situation of hundreds of domestic helps.“Every third day, I get a call from some domestic help seeking work. Some even come to the house. This is completely opposite to the pre-lockdown period, when getting a maid in this sector was a herculean task. That’s how bad their situation is now,” said KP Singh, an advocate who resides in Sector 28, Panchkula.Deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja said: “There is no restriction on the movement of domestic helps. Maids are allowed to work and no one can stop them. I have already issued orders in this regard.”Another senior official of the Panchkula administration, who did not wish to be named, confirmed RWAs have no authority to stop domestic helps from working in their societies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panchkula-s-apex-rwa-body-stops-entry-of-domestic-helps-in-violation-of-district-admn-s-orders/story-wg1nVAzA6qo6xXj2F3hYPJ.html

It had decided to first grant the connections to those who made payment for the five-star rating motor and estimated cost of connection.As per the department data, total 9,039 farmers have deposited the estimated amount, of which 2,065 connections were given to them till June 3.Haryana power minister Ranjit Singh Chautala had stated that the government would give out tubewell connections to 4,868 out of 9,039 farmers by June 15.A total of 1,848 farmers paid the estimated cost in Bhiwani, of which only 376 received connections. This was followed by Sirsa, where 1,499 farmers paid the amount, but only 261 were issued connections. In Sonepat, 88 farmers such farmers got the tubewell link out of 1,232.Farmers’ leader Balbir Takhan said even after paying ₹3 to ₹5 lakh (with estimated cost for poles and transformer), they have been waiting to get tubewell connections for the past five years.“Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had announced to release connections to 44,000 farmers ahead of Lok Sabha election in 2019, but the promise has fallen flat. Now, the government has declared 4,868 connections by June 15, but the remaining farmers will have to wait. Why is the government playing with our lives,” Takhan added.Juglal Singh, a farmer from Bhiwani’s Garwa village, said he had paid ₹3 lakh two years ago and since then he has been waiting to get a tubewell connection.“I had borrowed ₹3 lakh from a landlord at 18% interest to get the connection. Neither did I get one, nor am I able to repay the loan. Some landlord farmers had got the connection by paying ₹1 lakh extra under the Tatkal scheme. I don’t know when the government will release the connection to me,” said Singh.The power minister had said that rest of the farmers would get their connections later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/five-years-on-thousands-of-haryana-farmers-await-tubewell-connections/story-JY0Xg9CMBRp2SqFu9Fy5LP.html

And the recommendations of this committee were rejected by farmers across India.”“The committee had recommended steps to dismantle the FCI and its operations in certain states, while diluting coverage of the National Food Security Act. It had also suggested that warehousing should be privatised, and the FCI will encourage entrance of private sector into the food security architecture. The suggestions of the committee showed intent to promote the private sector at the cost of national food security,” he added.“It seems that the recent ordinances are a way for the central government to revive the rejected recommendations of the Shanta Kumar committee, without the requisite scrutiny. Privatisation of the agricultural sector will ensure death of the MSP system and further increase indebtedness of farmers,” Bajwa added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ordinances-anti-farmer-act-of-modi-govt-bajwa/story-NSa8S2Y7xh1HScc9xx2DgJ.html

We cannot reveal more at this stage,” said an officer privy to the investigations.Sources said the car was recovered from Kopar Khairane but did not disclose further details, claiming it would hamper the investigation.The crime branch is conducting a parallel probe into the matter.Tayde lived in Talavli village at Ghansoli with his family and was handling some constructions in Ghansoli. Police suspect the motive behind the murder is related to supply of construction material.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/civil-contractor-murder-cops-recover-car-used-in-crime/story-YGuZu6aKoQwnld2VwTHRAP.html

A police team confiscated the gym equipment from outside a gym near Issa Nagar Pull in the old city area. Complaining of losses, gym owners demanded permission to resume their business as most other sectors, including markets, hotels and liquor vends had been allowed to reopen.Gym Ekta Welfare Association director Ramesh Bangar said, “We are raising our voice against the discrimination by the government. Similar protests were held in various parts of the city. We ensured social distancing and took all precautionary measures. Yet, police seized equipment of a gym under political pressure. They returned it after some time.”Bangar said since the gyms were closed over two ago, owners had been burdened with electricity bills, hefty rent and salaries of staff. “But the government is not heeding our problems, even when working out helps boost a person’s immunity,” he added.Later, MLA Sanjay Talwar assured the gym owners that he had taken up the matter with chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and the government will take a decision on the matter soon. On June 4, different associations had staged protests by begging for alms at Jagraon bridge and exercising in the open near Jalandhar Bypass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/working-out-in-open-gym-owners-in-ludhiana-demand-permission-to-resume-business/story-mYg5xxqF7UZFMMb8kvUpHK.html

Earlier, the board had postponed the examinations due to the imposition of lockdown. To collect information, emails were sent to the schools on Thursday asking them to send the data by filling the 16-point pro forma by Friday. But, emails to at least 35 schools bounced back. Even their contact numbers have not been updated by school authorities on the board’s web portal.The officials confirmed that when they tried to contact schools on the numbers uploaded on the school login, they came to know either the school principal or the head has retired or nobody was replying to the calls.Due to this, officials are facing problems in gathering the information and this is delaying the process of compiling the data of the examination centres. On June 2, the board sent a letter to all district education officers across Punjab to send details of examination centres, number of students appearing, availability of rooms, number of teachers on Covid- 19 duty and names of five nearby schools affiliated with the board.The seven nodal officers deputed to gather information also revealed that many schools are not replying to the emails.For Class 12, the board has set up 216 centres and 18 for Class 10 (open school) students. The board is collecting data to conduct the pending exams for Classes 10 and 12. The subjects include physical education and sports, home science, mathematics, economics, music (tabla), fundamentals of e-business, political science, physics, business studies, geography and history.District education officer, secondary, Swaranjit Kaur, said, “We are collecting details from the schools and will send the information required by the board on Monday. The nodal officers are gathering details and will submit the compiled data by tomorrow. Many schools set up as examination centres are turned into quarantine centres where labour, patients with mild symptoms are staying.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/details-of-35-schools-set-up-as-exam-centres-in-ludhiana-not-updated-on-pseb-portal/story-0NfHSLrX9NUnbP7yyo9AgI.html

He alleged that one Nand Lal had fed his cow the dough balls stuffed with firecrackers while the animal was grazing in the field.Bilsapur superintendent of police (SP) Devakar Sharma said the cow was fed a highly explosive firecracker called the ‘aalu bomb’.He said a case under Section 286 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act has been registered and the role of the main accused named by the cow’s owner and other people in the case is being investigated.Wildlife officials said it was a common practice among farmers to keep firecrackers in dough balls to kill wild animals, mainly the blue bulls and wild boars, to protect their crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/now-pregnant-cow-s-jaw-blown-off-by-explosive-laden-wheat-flour-ball-in-himachal-s-jhandutta/story-aZB2a6LSqWD1yw4zS8nEUJ.html

Police had already taken all precautionary measures to avoid any untoward incident in the city.The police had put local leaders of various Hindu organisations and Sikh radicals under ‘house arrest’ and did not allow them to move out on Saturday.District president of the Youth Akali Dal (YAD) Gurdeep Singh Gosha was rounded from near the Clock Tower and the police did not allow him to move around.The administration had deployed additional 1,000 police personnel in the city to ensure peace in the city. At least 4,000 police personnel were already on lockdown duty.The cyber cell of the police had also kept a tab on social networking sites to check if someone was trying to provoke emotions of people by posting provocative content.Gosha said he was arrested without any reason when he was distributing langar. He said he was first taken to a police station before putting him under ‘house arrest’.Ashok Thapar, president of the Shaheed Sukhdev Thapar Brigade Anti Terrorist Front, who was kept under ‘house arrest’ said they had planned to hold a programme to pay tributes to the martyrs, who attained martyrdom in a fight against terrorism at the Daresi ground. But, the police did not allow them to move out and also sealed the Daresi ground.He added members of Hindu organisations, however, lit lamps at their homes to pay homage to martyrs.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said, “No one was kept under house arrest. Sensing the situation, the police requested leaders of both Hindu and Sikh organisations to stay home. Most leaders voluntarily offered to stay home. Those, who did not abide by the advice, the police rounded up then and took them to their homes.”No protest or any clash was reported in the city, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/operation-bluestar-anniversary-passes-off-peacefully-in-ludhiana/story-MeroCqEOPA7VFonl2VhkoI.html

All gurdwaras, temples, churches and mosques have remained closed since the curfew was imposed in the city on March 24, and any type of religious function and gathering was also banned.On Saturday morning, several devotees stepped inside the Sector 35 gurdwara, many of them without face masks, made mandatory in public places by the district magistrate. Community lunch was also being served here, and also at the Sector 38 and Sector 44 gurdwaras.However, Amarjeet Singh Silvia, vice-president of the Sector 35 gurdwara committee, denied that any religious function took place there. “The routine nitnem banis were read out in the morning. Only around 30 people living nearby and members of the gurdwara committee were in attendance, and a small langar was organised for them,” he said, even as some devotees there confirmed that they had come to celebrate Gurpurab.Police personnel were deployed outside many gurdwaras to maintain law and order in light of the Operation Bluestar anniversary. The cops deputed outside the Sector 38 gurdwara confirmed a small function was held and they ensured that all devotees were wearing masks.The Chandigarh Samuh Gurdwara Prabandhak Sangathan also confirmed that some gurdwaras remained opened. Its president, Tara Singh said, “A call was given by Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh to celebrate Gurpurab on Saturday. The prayers were completed by 9am at most places and only small langars were prepared while following all safety precautions.”Calling the gatherings unfortunate, chief spokesperson of Kendri Singh Sabha, Gurpreet Singh said, “The restrictions are for people’s safety. There is no compulsion for Sikhs to pray only in gurdwaras. They should stay home till the pandemic is controlled,” he said.The police claimed they received no information from the administration about whether the events were allowed. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP, PRO) Charanjit Singh Virk said, “The police didn’t receive any complaints regarding the functions. So, no action was taken.” Besides, he added, the respective gurdwara committees had informed the police that no langar or function was organised except for the ones that the administration had allowed. Cops were also deployed at gurdwaras after Criminal Investigation Department (CID) gave them information of the functions planned there, Virk said.UT adviser Manoj Parida remained unavailable for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-gurdwaras-reopen-two-days-too-soon-to-celebrate-gurpurab-mark-op-bluestar-anniversary/story-gpwA7v0iPAu0XCg8UMphDM.html

06-06-2020||Chandigarh||Random forays: Sports can re-energise the whole world||The crisp sound of a masterly cover drive which has been middled to perfection, the resounding thump of a tennis ball belted to and fro from the baseline, the sudden roar of a packed stadium as a fleet-footed forward nears the penalty area, the pleasing thwack of a shuttlecock swaying back and forth across a badminton net, the graceful gait of a rhythmic gymnast on the bare floor, the sheer drama of a sprinter tearing down a track at the peak of his prowess, the upraised arms of a proud champion, the pumped fist of a world beater, the hugs and huddles of all and sundry: Sports brings all such magical moments to us, year after year, unfailingly and unerringly.Thus, the absence of sports is being felt even more painfully in these times of a global pandemic. For the first time since World War II, the Olympic Games had to be postponed. All sporting activity came to a grinding halt, the world over, unprecedentedly. Hearts sank, heartbeats quietened, moods plummeted and eyes became teary. Not only do sportspersons miss sport when it does not happen, fans and aficionados sorely miss it as well. From couch potatoes who dearly look forward to events such as the Indian Premier League (IPL), to coaches, scribes, managers, assistants, groundsmen, helpers, scorekeepers, referees and umpires, a whole gamut of people miss sporting activities when they do not take place.Fortunately, there are signs that sport is haltingly re-emerging from its hiatus. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has happily announced that three Test Matches will be held against the visiting West Indians in July, albeit in a bio secure ‘bubble’ or reservoir to be created at the match venues. The Windies team will reside in quarantine like conditions at Old Trafford in Manchester for three weeks. India is likely to play a Test series in Australia under similar conditions later this year. European soccer appears to be limping back to some form of normalcy too, with players like Leo Messi having started training while wearing masks. And Vietnam has allowed spectators to pack football stadia without enforcing social distancing norms, even though people have to wear masks and undergo thermal testing. The US Open Tennis Tournament is still planned to be held in August in New York, though without spectators, and the French Open will take place in September at Roland Garros, after being postponed from May. The tennis magnum opus, Wimbledon, sadly, had to be cancelled for the first time since the World War.Even at the level of the common man, sports can play a rejuvenating role. With lockdown measures gradually being lifted now, it is imperative that everyone gets cracking and indulges in physical exercises outdoors every day. Playing a sport like badminton will enable all age groups to get back to fitness after the forced lethargy of previous weeks. And to keep that sporting momentum going for years to come should be the endeavour of all and sundry. Sport related exercises also help release endorphins which are happy hormones that make us much more balanced in our personalities.It is a proven fact that populations which indulge in sports have higher levels of happiness and an enhanced sense of well being. By encouraging and urging youngsters to play sport on a regular basis, our society can eliminate ills which beset sections of the youth today, including drugs, alcoholism and obsession with social media. The mood of the world has seldom sunk to such abysmally low levels as it has nowadays. People are clutching at straws to sense a whiff of good news from anywhere possible. Sport has the capacity to uplift sagging morale and rejuvenate sunken spirits like nothing else can. Nelson Mandela famously said, “Sports has the power to change the world!” Rousing people from their deflated existence and inspiring them to get going once again will be a herculean task, given the mass hysteria associated with the pandemic. But if one type of pursuit can re-energise, unite and propel humankind towards a happier, healthier, existence, it is sports. Let’s play, as soon as we can!vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/random-forays-sports-can-re-energise-the-whole-world/story-eA8AblMPWYOF3p6l4ldLJP.html

And rightly so since there haven’t been many opportunities for most budding actors during the coronavirus pandemic. But Singh sort of got his Bollywood breakthrough moment with his recent web series Paatal Lok. Produced by actor Anushka Sharma, the nine-episode series has received rave reviews for his performance as Imran Ansari — a soft spoken Kashmiri Muslim police officer — a character that is nuanced and has given the actor the well-deserved adulation from both within the industry and the public.Singh, a Delhi boy, who has been part of Bollywood films such as Aligarh (2015), Tamasha (2015) and Veere Di Wedding (2018), says his recent OTT outing has been a thrilling experience. Not many know that his earlier associated with Asmita Theatre Group in the Capital gave him his first cameo as a doctor in Raanjhanaa (2013). A background in theatre has certainly helped him in approaching characters with sensitivity. “Theatre is certainly the traditional way of approaching the craft. Films are just a modern medium of communicating the stories. Films and plays are different in the ways they are made. We often shoot as per the location and the scenes are broken. But theatre helped me tie the knots in a medium like cinema where the narrative is often fragmented,” says the 30-year-old.   First steps on stage #worldtheatredayA post shared by  ıɹɐsu∀ uɐɹɯI (@ishwaksingh) on Mar 28, 2020 at 4:09am PDTHis character, in the web series, is almost an antithesis to the image of the pot-bellied corrupt police officers that one is used to seeing on-screen. “Ansari believes in the system. He believes in the regime; he wants to be a super cop that straddles both the worlds; he wants to pursue IPS so that he can serve while he also wants to solve high profile cases and do the right thing. The character is endearing and inspiring all at once,” Singh says.But, to get into the skin of his character on OTT, Singh had to take to reading books to be able to enhance his character portrayal. “I’m from Delhi, so I could relate to the environment that is present in the series. I hung out at the outer district police stations and understood the rigorous pressure that police personnel are under. I also tried to witness different processes such as interrogations, investigations so as to learn more about the environment of a local police station.”He says that the onscreen camaraderie between his character Ansari and Jaideep Ahlawat’s Hathi Ram Choudhary is formed on the bedrock of a lot of mentor-rookie relationships that he has lived through and witnessed in life. “The script was very special and it just allowed me to bring forth the best of my abilities. When the two characters are interacting with compassion, kindness, and just simply looking out for each other, all these places are where my personal self came through. I could use my experiences to enrich the moments on screen.” Read More: Paatal Lok review: Anushka Sharma’s show is Amazon’s black-hearted yet brave answer to Sacred GamesAs the debate of OTT vs theatre and theatres continues to gather steam, Singh says that one medium’s success does not negate the importance of the other. “Just because a series does well, it does not mean theatres will become obsolete. The entire experience of watching a movie in a theatre is very personal. It is the most common and interactive form of recreation. We have memories of first dates or family outings to the theatre, and those cannot be substituted by watching movies on a laptop or your phone,” opines Singh, and elucidates that more mediums mean more content for people, and “these translate to more opportunities for filmmakers to experiment with the narrative and the format.”Read More: Abhishek Banerjee, Paatal Lok’s Hathoda Tyagi, says wife, mother refuse to watch show: ‘It’s the best compliment’While he is still reeling under the influence of mass adulation that has come his way, Singh has been quarantining with his family in Delhi. “I was originally quite bothered by the sudden lockdown. I was habitual of going out; reading scripts in cafes, playing cricket. But of late I have taken to honing other skills which has given a sense of stability to my routine. I’m learning a few musical instruments, and also dabbling in martial arts as well as contemporary dance. But as of now, I’m just very happy and busy with the entire experience of Paatal Lok.”Author tweets @Mallika_bhagatFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/paatal-lok-actor-ishwak-singh-success-of-ott-doesn-t-mean-theatres-will-be-obsolete/story-nqH7aJ2fCxvfem2HQAr6fP.html

The arrested woman is in her 30s and lived with her husband and in-laws in Bibvewadi. The police are on the lookout for the paramour. A complaint was lodged by the brother-in-law of the arrested woman. The family runs a business of spice-mixes (masala).“The woman was married since 2016 and had known the paramour, who is now on the run, from before the wedding. The reason behind the theft is being investigated. She will be police custody till June 9,” said assistant police inspector KB Pavase of Bibvewadi police station who is investigating the case. According to the complainant, on May 31, as the family was heading to Kothrud, the woman allegedly helped the man enter the house, and steal a bag containing Rs 1 crore. She helped him by giving information about where the spare house keys had been kept. She also pivoted or shut down four-five close circuit television (CCTV) cameras installed in and around the house.The woman had allegedly been helping the man for the past 11 months by slipping him jewellery from the house from time-to-time. She had allegedly aided in thefts of gold and diamond jewellery, cash, and gold coins, said police.However, the thefts came to light only when a bag containing Rs 1 crore cash disappeared from the house, according to the complaint submitted to the police.The total theft, over the past 11 months, is estimated to be worth Rs 1,74,40,000, according to the police.A case under Sections 380 (theft in dwelling house) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered at Bibvewadi police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/woman-held-for-helping-paramour-steal-rs-1-74-crore-from-husband-s-house/story-WlQqSedGUW1BdspaFNqS7O.html

Where are we going to keep these patients, their families and contacts? We have to alter our strategy of testing and quarantine,” he stated in a tweet.Dr Ijtaba Shafi, one of the health officers posted in Ganderbal district, said it was time to take a call on home isolation of asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic Covid-19 patients. “Let institutions be demarcated for low/high risk cases only. The surge is alarming. Some expert should speak on this before it’s too late.”Paediatrician and Doctors Association Kashmir president and Dr Suhail Naik said that on an average, one infected person has 50 primary contacts. “Around 200 cases land every day, leading 1,000 into administrative quarantine. India spends ₹2,440 on each person in quarantine centres. Soon, we will have shortage of beds, chaos and confusion. Time has come to stop administrative medicine,” said cautioned Naik.Dr Bilal Khan, a prominent gastroenterologist, said Kashmir has already entered into community transmission and now there is need to do mass testing. Medical experts believe that getting people back from different parts of the globe, especially those from affected areas, has also led to a surge in positive cases.Former faculty at Government Medical College, Srinagar, Dr Khursheed Qureshi, said the government should go for home quarantine, instead of administrative quarantine.In the last four days, J&K witnessed over 400 infections. “We can’t hold the administrative quarantine for much long as it has many loopholes. The administration should pay serious attention towards shifting from this strategy. The virus is going to stay here, so we need to remain prepared for it and how to tackle it. The experience of administrative quarantine didn’t prove much beneficial and it should be tweaked,” said Dr Amjid Ali, senior consultant at Government Medical College, Baramulla.“More than two lakh people have been tested and that is the main reason why we have registered a spike in Covid-19 cases,” a senior official from the administration said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-cases-surge-experts-ask-j-k-admn-to-home-quarantine-patients-with-mild-no-symptoms/story-9GMm4JZ9In5qjUAQl5618H.html

They are treated as outsiders despite their critical role in nation-building, including construction of highways, metros and skyscrapers.

Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee should be enforced to give due respect to migrant labourers.Anoop PanjwaniWake-up call for industriesEven as countries across the globe are working on developing a vaccine to fight coronavirus, we come across immunity building medicines from Kerala and Tamil Nadu, which have been reported to reduce the number of cases within the states. Kerala recently stood firm and showed a striking example of its handling of an unprecedented Covid-19 issue, but migrant crisis is a created one. At a time when Covid-19 can be possibly cured as in Kerala and China, the Maharashtra government ought to have taken care of migrants. Though work in the commercial capital has slowly restarted, the state government is facing shortage of migrants to work in construction and other sectors. With great difficulty migrants were packed off and now we see their shortage. Migrants are guest workers and they ought to have been protected. The present migrant labour crisis is a wake-up call for all stakeholders. Annapurani Shanthi From our Inbox Top priority should be medical healthThe Pune Municipal Corporation has initiated its long-pending process to recruit 97 doctors and residential medical officers to contain the spread of Covid-19 (High no. of cases push PMC to fill 97 med posts, June 2). The government-run Sassoon General Hospital’s administration has decided to recruit doctors. Almost 75 days have passed after the outbreak of coronavirus and no serious action is taken regarding recruitment of doctors and medical staff in hospitals. It exposes the lethargy on the part of government and authorities. The establishment of medical colleges is the need of hour. Top priority should be given to increase the availability of quality health professionals. Civic hospitals should run on public-private partnership.Anoop PanjwaniOnline education has flawsThe decision of educational authorities of several state governments to introduce online education is not a viable proposition. Continued use of smartphones for formal education could be quite harmful to eyesight. There was also a report about a girl who woke up at 4 am in order to go through her lessons for two hours on a smartphone, as her father had to take the phone with him to work! Unless a student can use a computer, which can be placed at a convenient distance from a student, online education is not a workable proposition.CK Subramaniam Indian cricketers are not angels A police complaint has reportedly been filed against former India cricketer Yuvraj Singh for a casteist remark that he made during a live chat recently on social media. Yuvraj stirred up the hornet’s nest after he made the remark towards Yuzvendra Chahal while having a conversation with Rohit Sharma on Instagram. Yuvraj has been facing backlash on social media. Indian cricketers are not angels as they involve in controversies time and again. Both Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul made sexiest comment in a TV programme Koffee with Karan and were banned for a period. Harbhajan Singh is “Singh is King” in controversies. His Monkeygate and Slapgate are talks of the town even now.Muringatherry Ramaswamy J||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/letters/story-q4BWjdgW0bFD2xD1KtFIPP.html

Yadav has been previously jailed in Kolkata in 2013 for two years in a double murder case.On the night of May 31, Yadav, Shetty and Pandit were drinking. After the two slept, Yadav slit their throats with a spade. “Yadav murdered Shetty and Pandit on May 31 night over denial of good food and delay in payments by Shetty. Shetty used to order food from outside while Yadav and Pandit had to eat at the restaurant which is shut for over a year due to repairs. The manager had also delayed Yadav’s salary on multiple occasions. Pandit was killed because he was an eyewitness. The accused used a spade to murder the victims and we are yet to recover the murder weapon,” said senior inspector Sandeep Kadam of Mira Road police station. After the murder, Yadav called the restaurant owner Gangadahar Payyade, using Shetty’s phone, and told him that Pandit and the manager had left for their hometowns. He then fled to Pune. Police traced the number and arrested him on Friday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mira-road-double-murder-accused-killed-colleagues-over-food-denial-delay-in-salary/story-1O8Nny2iVfpi4NJzGeHcUI.html
06-06-2020||Chandigarh||Witerati: Lollitas VS Lalits & Lauras in the time of Tin Pot||Unlock 1.0 might not have contended for competition in Primetime narratives until it beheld the Badshahs of Breaking News squeaking, left right and epicentre. To be battle ready when the cyclone came calling, that is.Nisarga notwithstanding, Unlock 1.0 went about its business. In its ‘Houseful Returns’ narratives, the Bais – Lalitas, Lajwantis & Co – returned to work for the Lollitas, unlock, stock and apparel. The apparel of consequence, that is their ticket to gaining entry into gated societies, being New Normal’s Half Burqa – the mask.Even as the masked life is meant to “Flatten the Curve”, Unlock 1.0 is scripting twists ‘n’ turns to the ‘Flatten the Curve’ narratives as well as certain “fatten” narratives. Of other wars on the trot & Tin Pot Wondered why WhatsApp groups were suddenly looking “fattened” in Unlock 1.0 or why certain email inboxes are bearing the burden of being bloated? If you thought Unlock 1.0 overnight bestirred your Biradri, BFFs & Co to bombard your inbox with missives enquiring about your well-being, perish the thought. The mail inbox may be looking inundated and fattened because war has broken out – nah, not the #Covid19 war outside, but the RWA war inside. Inside gated housing high-rises, plush or pockmarked, whose RWAs (Resident’s Welfare Associations) have been bestowed the title “Tin Pot dictatorships” or “Little Hitlers”.Unlock 1.0 has unlocked a Pandora’s Box.It’s battle lines drawn at the all-desi RWAs – between the top brass and residents with the loudest “bahas” or heaviest bass. A case of Lala jis & Latas VS Lalit jis & Lollitas. They’re warring over whether or not the Bais & Plumbing Wala Bhais are to be allowed into elevators or instead be made to navigate vertical treadmills (read “mountainous stairways”) up to the sixth or seventh floor; whether or not residents have to fill forms as wordy as Modi ji’s ‘Mann ki Baat’ for swearing on oath the Corona-freeness of their house helps; and all that.But what takes the cake (an entire bakery, perhaps) is when the RWAs ruminate over requests such as this emanating from the neighbouring Latikas of Lockdown: “Can you all please not disclose the Covid-positive case in our building, because if the apartment is sealed, my in-laws won’t get going back in Unlock?”It’s also free-for-all war at multi-racial RWAs in tourist states – between RWA top guns who are in-house and home owners who are away yet, with or without business visas, make it their business to plunge into policing of the RWAs. A case of Lavleens & Lalli Singhs VS Lauras & Larrys. What the multi-racial RWAs are warring about is whether or not migrant Indian guards or garbage-wallahs need to be dipped in the holy Ganges river waters before they’re considered Covid-free or hygienic enough to return to work for the Larrys & Co; and whether or not slum-dwelling Bais – Lalitas & Lajwantis – are to be allowed to scrub at the sanitised sinks of the Lauras and Lolas. (So much for all this videshi ‘squeak’ speak on shunning so-and-so, though back home in their countries – UK, USA et al – it’s their Prime Ministers and Princes, populating palaces ‘squeaky’ clean, who’re known to be the celebrity carriers of Covid19, one hell of a leveller pandemic!)It’s tolerable as long as the squabble and slugfest about Unlock 1.0’s dos and don’ts are directly between the warring parties. Where the slugfest spells treble trouble is when third parties find themselves caught in the crossfire. And their inbox is inundated with hate mail – spewing #NewNormal’s new vocabulary titled “Tin Pot dictators”. Ah, here one has to confess, (Shashi) Tharoor couldn’t accomplish that which has been done by Unlock’s lingo-ism labelled “Tin Pot” – driving one to go diving for the dictionary. The curious case of needing nerves of “steel” to survive these times of “Tin” Pot.Of ‘Fatten the Curve’ narrativesThe social media is staging signs of Unlock 1.0 too as Selfie-ism is no longer doomed to stay single and is ready to mingle, albeit with social distancing protocols in place.But Selfie-ism is in for a rude shock in the Unlock. When post-Lockdown’s Lollitas bump into BFFs – Latikas & Co – at “Lala” ki dukaan and want to freeze the Mahakumbh-Ke-Mele-Mein-Miley moment in Selfie-ism’s frame, it just doesn’t fit. Firstly, social distancing stands in the way of Selfie-ism of Unlock’s Lollitas and Latikas. But befitting here to spell the new body language of Unlock 1.0’s selfies. The new etiquette upon bumping into BFFs, Biradri & Co is to feign flinging forward your arms in the air to indicate you’re dying to hug or greet them, but just as the limbs are levitating midway, in an abrupt anatomical deactivation reminiscent of that childhood game, freeze the forearms pronto as though an invisible voice into your ears just did coo – “Statue”.Second, standing in the way of Selfie-ism is a tweaked narrative – Fatten the Curve. For, whilst “Flatten the Curve” narrative unfolded on television screens, in front of the screens rolled out the Quarantined Couch Potatoes’ “Fatten the Curve” narrative.The curious case of Unlock 1.0’s Selfie-ism trying to fit narratives of the unfit.chetnakeer@yahoo.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/witerati-lollitas-vs-lalits-lauras-in-the-time-of-tin-pot/story-4X5OcnaqIxkpjL91oQhaHJ.html

I really don’t mind these stupid adults’ ‘early departure’, through corona, but risking young innocent lives of future generations is criminal,” he tweeted. Many thought such a tweet from an officer of his standing was uncalled for. Unapologetic, Parida stood his ground saying his remark was just to ‘provoke’ people to think and stay safe in these difficult times.Punjab officers face the heat as green building turns furnaceIn 2010, the Forest Complex in Sector 68, Mohali, was built on the green building principle to conserve energy. A high-performance glass façade was installed to let in adequate light and keep the heat out. Sadly, that has not worked. Punjab government officials are literally facing the heat with the central air-conditioner switched off as a precautionary measure to check the spread of coronavirus. The state headquarters of the forests and wildlife preservation department has no fans either, forcing officials to keep their doors open. One of them said they failed to understand why the AC was switched off when there’s no public dealing.Colleague’s cough sends secretariat into tizzyPanic gripped the UT Secretariat in Sector 9 this week when one of the employees complained of cough and Covid-19 symptoms. He was immediately taken for a test and was said to be in regular contact with senior UT officials amid concern that the office may have to be sealed. Though the employee tested negative, his colleagues were visibly upset with the management over allowing visitors to the office. “There are two entries to the secretariat. At the one from which officers enter, there is some pretension of screening. But at the other, there is no check. We have not seen any sanitisation drive on any floor.”Charity for their own a causeDuring the coronavirus pandemic, both the Congress and BJP leaders have been actively donating masks, sanitisers and food to needy residents of Chandigarh. But every evening, they flood the inbox of mediapersons with press notes, proudly showcasing their charity.To save ₹100, woman loses gold bangleA resident of Zirakpur lost her gold bangle to a gang operating in town. The woman hitched a ride in a cab for Rs 50 after declining an autorickshaw driver charging her Rs 150 to drop her to office. The woman was robbed of her gold bangle en route and ended up paying a heavier price just to save Rs 100. Police have cautioned people to beware of such offers but not many pay heed.Mind your speed on Chandigarh roadsThe Chandigarh traffic police have started using the three recently acquired automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems to issue e-challans for speeding. The number of such challans has seen a spike of late. Deputy inspector general of police (DIG), traffic, Shashank Anand took to Twitter to share the highest speed recorded by the system. “The highest speed recorded on a road with a 60km/hr speed limit is 106 km/hr,” he said, adding that the licence of the defaulter will be suspended for at least three months.Health professionals offer healing touchThe administration at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research were in for a surprise when they received a phone call from the health authorities in Jammu that a Covid-19 patient suffering from liver failure, was on his way to hospital. The 40-year-old patient’s samples were taken in Jammu, but the condition worsened the family decided to move to PGIMER, without waiting for test results. The family was on the way when they got a phone call that the patient has tested positive. Dr Vipin Koushal, additional medical superintendent of the Covid-19 hospital in Chandigarh, said that they had swiftly acted on the communication and arrangements were being made to admit the patient and his suspected relatives. However, it took some time to set things right, while the patient waited in their vehicle.Virtually impersonating the Panjab University V-CTwo days ago, Panjab University employees received a spam email in which an impersonator posing as vice-chancellor Raj Kumar asked them for favours. The Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Computer Science Centre of the university swung into action and wrote an email to university employees, directing them not to respond or click on any link provided by such an emails.Checkmate at UT education deptLast week, the UT education department ordered banning the increase in school fee, proving that it’s still in the game of fee during the lockdown. Not only is it in the game, but the UT education department is also winning the battle against the city’s private schools. The order, released under the disaster management Act, which makes it difficult for schools to challenge it, is unlike previous orders with no legal standing.(Inputs by Surender Sharma, Hillary Victor, Shailee Dogra, Munieshwer A Sagar, Rajanbir Singh, Dar Ovais, Amanjeet Singh Salyal and Srishti Jaswal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tricity-buzz-ht-chandigarh-reporters-tracker-on-all-those-making-or-faking-news/story-K5Jqv0Abh1N6XA43uP8kJJ.html
06-06-2020||Chandigarh||Dearth of cardiac surgeons, cath labs at government hospitals across Punjab, patients at a loss||Heart patients in Punjab have to choose between paying exorbitant bills at private hospitals or travelling to the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, in the absence of cardiac surgeons or catheterization laboratories (cath labs) where angiographies and angioplasties are performed at most hospitals and healthcare centres across the state. Surprisingly, there are no cardio surgeons at Government Medical College, Patiala and Amritsar, or at the Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital (GGSMC), Faridkot.According to health department , there are only four cardiologists in state-run institutions across Punjab- three in Government Medical College (GMC), Faridkot and one at GMC, Amritsar. GMC Patiala does not have a single cardiologist. ONE OF TWO CATH LABS DEFUNCT The state has only two cath labs, of which only one is functioning. The government medical colleges of Amritsar and Faridkot are the only ones with a cath lab. However, the lab GMC, Amritsar is defunct.In the absence of cath labs, cardiac patients have to either pay around 1.5 lakh per angioplasty at private hospitals or they have to travel to PGIMER Chandigarh.COMMUTE CONSUMES GOLDEN WINDOW A doctor at GMC, Amritsar, pleading anonymity, said, “Patients needing angiography, angioplasty and bypass heart surgery are being referred to PGIMER, Chandigarh. It takes five to six hours to reach PGI while the patients have only have a one hour window to be treated. Unfortunately, many patients don’t make it.”A doctor at GMC, Patiala, also requesting anonymity, said, “In the absence of a cath lab or cardiologist, patients are either sent to private hospitals or PGIMER, Chandigarh. Private institutes charge around Rs 1.5 lakh per angioplasty.”“Sometimes patients from Mansa travel three-four hours to reach GMC, Patial, only to be told to undertake another hour long journey to PGI. The commute consumes the golden window,” he said. NO RELIEF IN OFFING GMC, Amritsar, principal Dr Sujata Sharma said, “We had cath lab and cardiologist but we had to shut down the lab due to some reason. I cannot share anything more than that.”Patiala GMC principal Dr Harjinder Singh said, “A cardiologist is yet to be appointed here. Besides we will soon have a cath lab at super specialty centre at Government Rajindra Hospital. At present, the centre is occupied for treatment of Covid-19 patients. Once the crisis is over, machinery and equipment of the cath lab will be installed.”However, GGSMC principal Dr Dipak Bhatti said, “We have a cardiologist and cath lab here and are performing angiography and angioplasty at the institute.”Medical Education and Research Department principal secretary DK Tiwari and minister OP Soni did not respond to calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dearth-of-cardiac-surgeons-cath-labs-at-government-hospitals-across-punjab-patients-at-a-loss/story-GWrtsqeAgjU1gZK3w729MJ.html
06-06-2020||City||Rainfed agriculture network launches farmer awareness campaign in Himachal||In order to boost the immunity of the people of the state amid coronavirus pandemic, HimRRA - a state group of Revitalising Rainfed Agriculture (RRA) Network has decided to run a state-wide farmers awareness campaign incorporation with various NGOs, civil society organisations and individuals of the state to motivate farmers to grow food crops in some portions of their landholding along with others crops.Various tools such as video, posters and pamphlets are prepared for information and communication purposes under this campaign to answer questions such as what are the source of good nutrition, why to grow food crops, which crops to prefer, how to grow and process the millets and why it is important to grow local varieties and likewise.Sukhdev Vishwapremi, member of Parvatiy Tikau Kheti Abhiyan said that through this campaign, the civil society organisation will reach out to farmers’ families and request them to keep a small portion of their landholding under food crops cultivation as well as will provide the information on their importance to fight coronavirus.He said that many experts stated that people with good immunity can better fight the viruses. So, it is of utmost importance to prioritise the immunity of individuals to mitigate the potential infection of viruses. Himachal Pradesh is an agrarian livelihood dominated state with 70% of its working population indulged in the same but in the past few decades, priorities were given to cash crops in place of food crops. At present approximately 1/3rd of its total sown area is under horticulture and commercial farming, which is highest in any mountain states of India.To build a sound immune system it is important to consume nutrition rich content such as millets, vegetables, pulses, oilseeds and milk products. Historically, they were the inherent part of the food system in the Himalayan region but over the years the same got replaced with cash crops and people shifted towards processed food, he added.This campaign will be covering as many as 10 districts of the state and will be carried out before the sowing of Kharif crops. Seeing the limitation of physical meetings and discussion, associates of NGOs will reach out to various farming families, Self-help groups, Mahila Mandal, farmers’ club, FPOs and PRI representatives through telephonic calls and messaging tools such as Whatsapp.The campaign had already started in most of the targeted areas in the state. Along with the awareness around the cultivation of nutrition crops, farming families are also motivated to get involved in the various contemporary agrarian livelihood programmes of the Himachal Pradesh government such as “Mukhya Mantri Ek Bigha Yojana”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rainfed-agriculture-network-launches-farmer-awareness-campaign-in-himachal/story-VGkFqyUDe6vBLYY9PdQmPL.html
06-06-2020||Mumbai||Allow father to meet kids through video call during lockdown: HC to mother||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed a woman to allow visitation access of her two children to her estranged husband through video conferencing during lockdown. The order was issued after the man filed a contempt petition complaining that the woman was refusing him visitation rights of their two children, aged 5 and 2 years, as directed by the magistrate’s court. The man submitted that while previously he was denied visitation on one pretext or the other, during lockdown he was denied visitation on the grounds of Covid-19 pandemic, and urged the court to pass direction that he be allowed to meet his children through video conferencing.A bench of justice SC Gupte while hearing an interim application in a contempt petition filed by a Pune-based man was informed by advocate Aditi Bhat that his wife along with their two minor children — a son and daughter — have been living with her parents since the couple separated. The judicial magistrate first class in the Pune Cantonment, in an order, had directed the woman to give visitation rights to the man twice a week for two hours each and three hours on days of festival. However, despite the order the woman had refused visitation rights, following which the contempt petition was filed for not complying with the magistrate’s order.Bhat further submitted that as Pune was severely affected by Covid-19, it was not feasible for the man to meet his children physically, and asked the court to direct the woman to allow him to meet his children through video conferencing.The woman’s advocate Bhuwan Jayant, however, justified her stand saying the man was abusive and that she did not allow him to meet the children for their safety.After hearing the submissions the bench observed, “Be that as it may, it is a matter of fact that today there is an order of a competent court giving visitation rights to petitioner. It is also a matter of fact that due to the difficult situation prevailing in the state and particularly in Pune, which is seriously affected by the present Covid-19 pandemic, physical access cannot be had as of now.” In light of this, the court directed the woman to allow the man to meet the children twice a week through video internet/phone access and disposed of the interim application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/allow-father-to-meet-kids-through-video-call-during-lockdown-hc-to-mother/story-I0hdCsBzazvs3vDTZVPJMN.html

The situation seems to have spiralled out of control,” said Sharma.“At a time when people are left with no money and the government too hasn’t provided direct monetary help, the restriction on new schemes will definitely result in unemployment reaching its peak,” he added.He said the decision also exposes financial mismanagement and the government’s inability to address the core issues.The Congress leader said that not only there will be a restriction on the new schemes, but the already sanctioned projects will remain suspended till August 31, 2021, or till further order, whichever is earlier.When no infrastructural work is to be undertaken, what the labourers would do, he asked.Sharma asserted that the economic stimulus packages for various sectors announced by the finance minister last month were also beyond comprehension of the common man.“On May 12, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the ₹20 lakh crores economic package, which he said, is 10% of the GDP and would provide an opportunity towards becoming self-reliant. But, how this would be possible without real financial help is not understandable,” said Sharma.It is the common masses who are suffering because of an incompetent government and its poor decision making, he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-to-new-schemes-for-a-year-hints-at-crumbling-indian-economy-says-himachal-cong-leader/story-qxpszjMnJXm7mPfOsfZPhL.html
06-06-2020||Chandigarh||WILDBUZZ: On a dark night, those blood-red eyes||On a coal-black moonless night were a jungle fire to light up the edges of the dark dome, you would in that imagery find an analogy to describe the eyes of a very rare owl of our region. The Mottled Wood owl flashes dark reddish-brown eyes rimmed with eyelids of coral red. Those mysterious and brooding eyes preside over a beautifully mottled and vermiculated face with plumage etchings in reddish brown, black, white and buff. Hence the owl’s poetic Sanskrit name, Raktalochan, or the one with blood-red eyes. The good news for the tricity’s vibrant community of bird watchers, owl lovers and Nature enthusiasts is that a second family of this owl species has been discovered with two growing ‘bacchas’ at the Peermuchalla forests, Zirakpur. The first photographic record from the tricity of a family of four owls came from the haloed groves of the Chandigarh Golf Club in May 2018 following a freakish discovery of one fledgling stranded on the verdant fairways by the caddie of international golfer, Sujjan Singh.The owls in the Peermuchalla forests were discovered by Ranjit Singh, a retired deputy general manager from the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation. Singh has undertaken creditable field work to photo-document birds of the Ghaghar-Peermuchalla range. After the owls gave birth to two chicks in an old, dead tree hollow this spring, Singh was joined by Gurjeet Virk, an owl lover and bird photographer who had taken premature retirement from the Indian Air Force’s accounts wing.Together, they protected the dead tree from being cut down or intruders disturbing the family. Virk makes two trips a day to the nesting tree to ensure the owl family’s safety. They are happy to record that while one chick has begun to fly about and perches next to the father on an adjacent tree, the other chick is yet confined to the nest under Mummy’s care but will take wing soon enough, if all goes well.Mottled Wood owls are endemic to the subcontinent but are one of the least-studied owls in the world. Fortunately, due to the painstaking field work undertaken over seven years by researchers from the Ela Foundation, Pune, Savitribai Phule University, Pune, and Ben Gurion University, Israel, we do have some understanding of their breeding ecology and the possible threats the species is faced with. The resultant study, titled, Breeding Biology of the Mottled Wood owl in West-Central India, was published in the prestigious journal of the Raptor Research Foundation. I spoke to Dr Satish Pande, the lead researcher who has been personally observing and understanding these fascinating owls for 26 years. “We collected 1,033 pellets from the nests of the 15 breeding pairs of Mottled Wood owls during the course of our study. From these, 711 prey items were identified. The major prey types were insects (39.2%) and small mammals (rodents 10.4%; shrews 21.0%). We also identified the remains of birds (11.0%), reptiles (9.4%), bats (3.4%), scorpions (1.1%), amphibians (0.7%), and molluscs (4.1%). In our study area of Pune, owls breed from the second week of February to May. The clutch size is usually two to three white, oval eggs, but one pair fledged four young. Nests are chosen in tree hollows with an opening to the sky. But unusually, we also have some records of this owl taking over the sticks nest of other birds such as one from Uttar Pradesh recently where the Mottled Wood owl pair occupied a crow nest,” Dr. Pande told this writer. When I asked Dr Pande to explain the marked difference in size of the Peermuchalla chicks, ie, one could fly while the other was still in the nest, he said this was due to the fact that the female owl lays eggs at intervals of two days. “So, they hatch also in a staggered time sequence accounting for the difference in growth between siblings from the same clutch,” said Dr Pande. “The species’ habit of nesting in large, old trees, including dead trees, could pose a conservation threat. Wood cutting in rural areas is usually directed toward older trees that are more likely to harbour natural nest hollows used by owls and the preservation of old, robust trees in open areas is usually not a priority in conservation strategies. Old, dead trees are also eco-systems, so we recommend preservation of old trees, whether alive or dead, that stand singly in open habitats. The other threat is from secondary poisoning, ie the owl chicks ingesting dead rodents brought by their parents which were poisoned by farmers.Our study found presence of poisoned rats in three different nests, which resulted in the deaths of four owl nestlings,” Dr Pande explained.“In conclusion, our limited research on this endemic and little-studied species raises several points of immediate concern. Although the research community currently knows little of its ecological status and threats, our data suggest that the Mottled Wood Owl’s breeding capacity could impose constraints on the population, particularly in the face of increased human encroachment in rural areas. Additionally, its apparent inability to nest near human activity could become a handicap if the species is limited by habitat loss to urbanisation or other anthropogenic changes,” warned the study.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-on-a-dark-night-those-blood-red-eyes/story-GIo9xfTO11vhm9mTvPz7PN.html
06-06-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 crisis akin to Mahabharata, must turn challenge into opportunity: Khattar||Likening the coronavirus crisis to the Mahabharata, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in his online address on Post Corona: Self Reliant India to faculty and staff of the Kurukshetra University on Saturday said people will have to implement changes in their daily lives to emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic. “Educational institutions were to open on March 15 after Holi but we suddenly had to declare a lockdown to control the pandemic, which was challenging, especially for students who were preparing for exams,” he said.“Most exams were cancelled or postponed due to the pandemic . There is no clarity on how the situation will return normal but we have to turn this challenge into an opportunity,” he said.MUST CHANGE LIFESTYLE: KHATTAR “The year 2020, is new version of life and we have to adopt it,” he said. He recounted the steps taken by the Centre and state governments to deal with the situation and provide relief to people. He said becoming self-dependent will take time as there was need to make changes in lifestyles.The CM said the government had announced some changes to ensure studies continued during the lockdown and 52 lakh students were receiving online classes introduced by the NCERT and two lakh students were being provided classes through the Siksha Setu App. COLLATERAL FREE LOANSHe said efforts were being made to provide collateral free loans to students.He said the pandemic had affected the life of sportspersons as they were unable to practice and all sporting events had been called off. The chief minister told students that the pandemic had made countrymen realise their strength as developed countries such as the USA had to beg for support from India:”The USA had to beg for support from us and we extended our helping hand. This is our strength,” he said. The CM said that Haryana was ready to extend support to the country during the crises and will fulfil Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s expectations and become the growth engine of the country.‘AVOID CHINESE PRODUCTS’Khattar also stressed on the need to cut import and increase domestic production to make India self-reliant.“We should avoid Chinese products and support local products. It is China versus the rest of the world as China is the birthplace of the coronavirus and there is need to isolate it financially,” he said.“Self-reliance can only be achieved if we have self- confidence,” Khattar said, giving the example of former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri.“India used to import wheat before the green revolution but now India has surplus wheat,” he said. Khattar, however, blamed other states for the increasing number of infected persons in Haryana, but said that the government was fighting against the coronavirus and it will win. During his speech, the chief minister did not say anything about the government’s plans to hold examinations of students studying in state universities and colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-crisis-akin-to-mahabharata-must-turn-challenge-into-opportunity-khattar/story-MLo1hPnqCyCpIKzwdsqOVO.html
06-06-2020||Chandigarh||ROUNDABOUT: Remembering Rama Sharma, a woman of substance||Yes, that was Rama Sharma for you, a pioneering PR woman and journalist, who paved the way for the likes of us of the next generation to join these professions which were once men’s bastions.It is with love and warmth that one remembers this wonderful person who passed away at 85 in her sleep at dawn on May 30 in Mohali. Her only daughter who had been taking care of her for the past many years as her health declined was by her side.Rama was yet another example of a daughter of Partition joining the Indian workforce and excelling at her job. She was a familiar figure for me because like her I came from a huge clan that had migrated from West Punjab in 1947 and had daughters who went for higher education and then made careers for themselves. Born eight years after Partition and though considered a child of free India, my trail too followed the ones tread by people like her and my older sisters.Survivors’ talesJust recently my cousin Kamla, who excelled both as a scientist in the United States and a poetry and fiction writer, penned a poem to the girls of the 1960s in the city named after Goddess Chandi.Recalling a season of suicides as ‘mothers of Partition’ turned upon daughters not pretty enough to fetch a well-placed husband or born instead of the much-awaited male child, the poetess writes about the survivors: “In vengeance, a large number of daughters of the city/Became doctors, engineers, magistrates, teachers and some journalists!” Born in 1935, Rama accompanied her lawyer father, mother and three brothers from Lahore to Moga. Witness to the devastation of Partition and the violence against and disowning of abducted Hindu girls by their own kin, Rama’s parents made her aware of the importance of education and a career. “You have to depend on yourself and no one else,” they told her.After doing her master’s at DM College Moga, first in Hindi literature and then in English Rama got married to a banker. Even though her husband and his family were not very keen on her taking up a job, her mind was made up and she started with teaching before taking up the position of a public relations officer in larger Punjab, stationed at Shimla. Those were times when PR was an all-male domain. Rama would recall with glee the time when she was sent to Kinnaur and the team welcoming her there enquired where the officer was. “I told them I was the officer,” laughed the woman whose forte was wit and repartee till the end.Political reporterWhen we joined journalism in the late 1970s, her Himachal Tourism PRs office opposite the Sector 17 Bus Stand was the meeting place where journalists of the likes of Shekhar Gupta and Vipin Pubby, among others, met regularly for coffee and conversation.And then, even after retiring from her government job, Rama, not the one to sit at home, became the Himachal correspondent for Navbharat Times, thoroughly enjoying her stint at journalism.An upright reporter and a woman of strong beliefs, Rama was never afraid of speaking out her mind. She literally reigned over Shimla and a trip to the Himachal capital was never complete without a cup of coffee with her at the club. Once I recall we got late and it was drizzling. She just made a phone call and lo! a couple of policemen appeared with umbrellas to escort us to the car!Empowering girlsEducation for girls remained Rama’s prime concern and it was with tears that Sanju, her domestic help, remembered her. “She personally took interest in educating me and it was a day of joy for both of us when I completed my BA!” Fiercely independent, she lived on her own as long as she could till her journalist daughter Aruti Nayar brought her to the tricity to live in the same complex as her, but in another flat with a caretaker.For Aruti it is a big loss as Rama had been her only anchor after her father had passed away when she was in school. However, what has been comforting for her is that she was with her mother till the end, taking care of her every need.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/roundabout-remembering-rama-sharma-a-woman-of-substance/story-kJbuPtgGxVJjKT6bElytTL.html

However, there are less passengers and I did only two trips on Friday.”Rohit Kamble, an auto driver said, “I kept a mask and sanitiser in the auto. There are less passengers and it will take some time for business to peak. In order to earn money, I need to wait for customers,” he said.Tanaji Lavate who is a senior citizen said, “My family is not allowing me to drive the auto as senior citizens are more prone to the infection.

06-06-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand HC issues notice to state tourism minister for defying quarantine norms||Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Friday issued notice to state tourism minister Satpal Maharaj and sought reply from the state government within three weeks on a public interest litigation (PIL), alleging Maharaj had violated quarantine norms and attended the state cabinet meeting on May 29, following which chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and two cabinet ministers, Madan Kaushik, and Harak Singh Rawat, had to self-quarantine themselves on June 1. Maharaj had attended the cabinet meeting on May 29 and two days later he tested coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive. Besides CM Rawat and some other ministers, a few senior bureaucrats from the state were also present in the meeting.Earlier, Maharaj’s wife had tested Covid-19 positive on May 30. The following day, Maharaj, his two sons, daughters-in-law and along with 17 of his staff members tested Covid-19 positive.On May 20, the Dehradun district administration had pasted a notice on Maharaj’s personal residence to adhere to quarantine norms after two of his guests had come from Delhi amid the easing of nationwide lockdown restrictions, which were imposed from March 25 to contain the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak.Maharaj had said that the portion of his house, where the quarantine norms were enforced, was separate from where he lived with his family, including his office and the guest room.Advocate Gopal K. Verma, who appeared on behalf of the petitioner Umesh Kumar, cited in the plea that Maharaj had attended the cabinet meeting in violation of the quarantine notice issued by the Dehradun district magistrate (DM) at his personal residence.The PIL accused the state government of adopting double standards by booking the general public for violating quarantine norms, while a cabinet minister such as Maharaj was allowed to blatantly violate the rules.“Why no action should be taken against Maharaj?” advocate Verma asked.Cabinet minister and state government spokesperson Madan Kaushik said the state government would evaluate the court’s notice and make a submission within the stipulated three weeks.Dehradun district authorities had said on June 1 CM Rawat and two other Cabinet ministers, Kaushik and Rawat, didn’t need to go under self-quarantine.The DM had cited that all three were low risk and could carry out their daily work, but they would have to follow the guidelines issued by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on May 18 on precautionary measures to be taken at a workplace to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Opposition Congress has also accused Maharaj of negligence and demanded that he should be booked under an ‘attempt to murder case’ for posing a health risk to others.“Maharaj, who holds a responsible position as a state Cabinet minister, has shown gross negligence, despite the DM’s notice,” said Garima Dasauni, spokesperson of the Congress’s Uttarakhand unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-hc-issues-notice-to-state-tourism-minister-for-defying-quarantine-norms/story-JW7vKjtfWzA7yHdX4N8KyN.html
06-06-2020||Patna||Covid-19 testing facility in all districts of Bihar by June 15: Mangal Pandey||Bihar Health Minister Mangal Pandey on Friday asserted that the number of Covid-19 testing is increasing continuously in the state and said that around 5,000 tests are being conducted at 26 centres in Bihar.“The number of Covid-19 testing has been increasing continuously in the state. Currently, the capacity to conduct the test is about five thousand. At present, four thousand patients are being tested with RT-PCR machine and the remaining tests are being done through CV net machine and True net machine at 26 centres in the state,” said Pandey.During the high-level meeting, the Chief Minister instructed the Chief Secretary and other officials attending the meet to ensure that all districts conduct testing by June 15.Pandey further said that the target of conducting ten thousand tests daily would be achieved by June 20.“Apart from CV net machines, cartages have also been brought for in the state. A Cobas machine, which has the capacity to perform more than a thousand tests daily, has arrived in the state. At the same time, two RNA extractor machines have been installed at RMRI and Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), Patna. Also, an additional automated RNA extractor and RT-PCR machine is being sent to Shrikrishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH), Muzaffarpur, which will be operational in the next one week,” Pandey said.“Apart from this, 35 True Net machines have been installed in the state and 22 machines are being installed. In addition, 30 more True Net machines will be installed in various districts of the state by June 15. Thus a total of 87 true net machines will start functioning in the state,” added Pandey. He said that additional and 20 True Net machines from other sources will also be installed in various institutions. The Health Department has thus ensured a programme to achieve the target of ten thousand tests by June 20, 2020, and conduct tests at all district centres.Currently, there are 21 thousand 35 (21,035) isolation beds in the state. A comprehensive plan has been chalked out to increase the number of these isolation beds to 40 thousand and necessary guidelines have been given to high officials in this meeting.

06-06-2020||Delhi||Tests for Covid-19 have not stopped, Arvind Kejriwal says amid criticism||Testing of samples for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has not been stopped, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday after a number of complaints from people who say they have symptoms but have not been able to find out if they are infected.Arvind Kejriwal said if there are last-minute teething problem, they will be sorted out.“As of today, 5,300 samples have been tested. Tests have not stopped. There are 42 labs, including government as well as private facilities, in Delhi which test samples,” Arvind Kejriwal said.“There were six laboratories which were not working properly. Shouldn’t we take action against them? We took action against them,” he added.But 36 labs are still working, he pointed out. “We just took action against six of them. Why are they being protected?” he asked.“If people have to get tested they can go to any government or private hospitals’ flu clinics. They can go to the 17 testing centres of the Delhi government. They can also go to the private labs,” he said.The AAP leader also claimed that Delhi is conducting the highest numbers of Covid-19 tests and the government’s biggest priority is to save lives. Even though the testing capacity is ramped up, it will be limited, he added. “If all asymptotic people turn up to get tested, the system will collapse. People are scared and this fear has to be rooted out. They want to get tested because of this fear,” he said.He urged all those who are asymptotic not to insist on being tested for Covid-19.“If asymptotic people will insist on getting tested, testing for those in a critical condition will stop,” he argued and requested them not to go to labs.At least eight testing centres were banned by the Delhi government on Thursday and the administration issued notices asking them to explain why their documents were not in order and the reason for now following guidelines on who can be tested. The move is expected to have shaved off at least 4,000 daily tests from the capital’s capacity.These labs have been asked not to pick up individual samples but samples sent by various hospitals and other agencies will continue being processed in these labs, the statement added.A doctor at Sir Ganga Ram hospital, who asked not to be named, said the lack of testing could be causing people with no or mild symptoms not being identified for Covid-19.“Asymptomatic carriers are a huge number that runs the risk of infecting others. You need to open up testing criteria because these people otherwise will keep spreading the infection without knowing,” the doctor cited above said.“Then there are people going for surgeries, or dialysis or chemo patients, who may be carriers and run the risk of infecting health care workers. Why is it difficult to understand that we need to expand not just testing labs but also testing criteria, and not restrict it,” the doctors said.The testing criteria was made stricter earlier in the week when the city administration said only symptomatic close contacts will be tested for the disease, replacing a previous rule that allowed for asymptomatic close contacts of a confirmed patient to be eligible for a test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/tests-for-covid-19-have-not-stopped-arvind-kejriwal-says-amid-criticism/story-koqUOTNY0LIbU0fLYl9HsN.html

06-06-2020||Chandigarh||Labour shortage from Nepal may upset Himachal’s applecart||Himachal Pradesh’s Rs 4,000-crore fruit economy largely depends on ‘sturdy’ labourers from Nepal. However, this time most labourers will give the apple harvesting season a miss owing the coronavirus pandemic.Apple growers say their business, which constitutes 89% of the total fruit economy, will suffer as Nepalese labourers, who have been the backbone of Himachal’s apple industry for around six decades, have not returned to the state after winter owing to the pandemic.They are also staring at huge losses owing to transport and market issues.An apple grower, Naresh Sharma of Dhano village in Theog, said, “The yield of apple crop is less than normal this season largely due to unfavourable weather. The shortage of labourers has added to our woes.” Normally labourers return to Nepal in November and start returning to Himachal Pradesh in March-April for apple harvesting, which continues till October. LABOUR CONCERNED ABOUT GOING HUNGRY Labour contractor Satish Begta says, “Besides the threat of Covid-19, fear of being quarantined is discouraging most labourers from return to the state.”Another contractor said the Nepalese workers fear that they may die of hunger if they are not able to earn during quarantine and as such are not keen on returning to work.“The government should build relief camps for the migrant workers with arrangements to provide food and necessary facilities. A portal must be created for the labourers to get themselves registered with the government,” he said.Himachal Pradesh is one of India’s major apple producing regions, with around 90% of the produce going to the domestic market.Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said the government was in touch with labour contractors to ensure return of the labourers.“Many labourers had returned to Nepal, but some are still here. Labourer from Uttar Pradesh is also coming. We will ensure labour is available during the apple season,” he said. As per the state horticulture department, this season apple production in the state was 25-30% less than last year’s record harvest of around four crore boxes.Besides Shimla district, which alone accounts for 80% of the total apple production, most apple cultivation is concentrated in Kullu, Mandi, Lahaul and Spiti, Kinnaur and Chamba.Agro commodities trading house Adani Agrifresh has targeted to procure 23,000 tonnes of apples this season.Besides Adani, other prominent private trading houses like CONCOR, Reliance Fresh, Mother Dairy, Big Basket and Dev Bhoomi are also procuring apples.DEMAND FOR INDIAN APPLES HIGHTrade insiders say the apple market scenario this season indicates that imports from China and Washington have gone down and the demand for produce of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, which is of a superior quality, will capture the market in Delhi and Kolkata.Growers fear the non-arrival of ‘ladanis’, the fruit wholesale buyers who come from other states like West Bengal, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, can also upset their applecart.“The lockdown has resulted in piling up of stock and there are close to 200 workers at our three facilities in Rohru, Rampur and Sainj in Shimla district,” said an official of Adani Agri Fresh Ltd, which is engaged with around 20,000 apple farmers in the state.He said several workers, a majority from Nepal, have returned to their hometowns and the company has arranged for workers to stay back comfortably.According to Economic Survey 2019-20, a total of 6.64 lakh tonnes of apples were marketed in the state till December 2019 against 3.68 lakh tonne in 2018-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/labour-shortage-from-nepal-may-upset-himachal-s-applecart/story-GiXoejh1gcEhmkhwlgCZkL.html
06-06-2020||Dehradun||‘Better sooner than later’: BJP on Congress slashing its MLAs salaries||The Uttarakhand Congress has agreed on the Trivendra Singh Rawat-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government’s two-month-old decision of slashing 30% of the salaries of all the hill state’s legislators because of the deepening economic crisis triggered by the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.Congress’s Indira Hridayesh, the leader of the opposition in Uttarkhand assembly, said on Thursday that her party lawmakers have agreed to the 30% pay cut.“All our 11 members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) have agreed to the state government’s decision of a 30% salary cut. We’re supporting the government amid this economic crisis triggered by the pandemic.”Hridayesh, however, took a dig at the government. “It’s a dangerous trend that the government didn’t take the opposition into confidence before taking such a crucial decision. It’s unacceptable in a democratic system,” she alleged.Earlier on April 8, the state government had announced the 30% salary cut for all the 70 lawmakers. However, the Congress had accused the government of not taking the main opposition into confidence before it took such a ‘unilateral’ decision.On Thursday, the party had a change of heart and wrote to CM Rawat and Speaker Premchand Agarwal, acceding to the state government’s decision.In Uttarakhand, an MLA is entitled to a monthly salary of Rs 45,000, while that of a minister is Rs 45,000. CM Rawat draws a monthly salary of Rs 90,000.On Friday, the state BJP described the Congress’s decision as “better late than never”.“We welcome the Congress’s decision on the matter. Though they are late, they’ve agreed in the end,” said Ajendra Ajay, spokesperson for the BJP’s Uttarakhand unit.Ajay however, termed the Congress’s accusations of not taking the opposition into confidence as illogical. “It’s a lame excuse for not giving up 30% of their salary in the fight against the pandemic.

06-06-2020||Kolkata||Ahead of state polls, Mamata warns TMC against corruption in relief work||Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday warned her party against “politicising relief work” for the coronavirus pandemic and Cyclone Amphan and corruption in the public distribution system.Mamata Banerjee also instructed TMC leaders to intensify political campaign on social media highlighting her government’s successes in the past nine years.She gave those instructions during an internal meeting of the party, held over videoconferencing, on Friday evening. The meeting went on for nearly three hours as state and district-level leaders, including district-unit presidents and select members of the state assembly and Parliament, attended it.Mamata Banerjee inquired from the leaders about the situation on the ground and made some organisational changes at the district-level. She stressed on the need to reach every door with the government’s success stories and avoid doing anything that could earn the party a bad name.“She said that the party must not get involved in the relief work—leaving it to the administration—and that the relief for Covid-19 lockdown and Cyclone Amphan must reach all victims, supporters of all parties,” a Lok Sabha member of the TMC, who did not want to be named, said.“She also said that the government will take strong action against people corrupting the ration distribution system and the party would not stand by anyone found involved,” the lawmaker cited above added.Her meeting came in the wake of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) launching its 2021 electoral campaign, branded as ‘Aar Noi Mamata’ literally meaning no more Mamata, and calling for the toppling of the TMC regime next year. Union home minister Amit Shah is scheduled to address a virtual rally of the state unit of the BJP on June 9.Incidentally, all of the TMC’s opponents in Bengal – the BJP, the Left and the Congress – have targeted the Mamata Banerjee government and her party for corruption in providing government relief due to Covid-19 and Cyclone Amphan.Referring to the BJP’s increased political activities, Banerjee told her party that they too must start the campaign and revive public relations – through social media and at their localities – and activate the booth-level units for this purpose.“She said we needed to stand by the people on the ground and take our success stories to every door. She gave special thrust on countering BJP’s propaganda on social media,” said a district unit president of TMC.No TMC leaders spoke on record because it was an internal meeting.The TMC chief also warned the party against infighting.“Don’t comment against the party staying in it. I am telling this particularly to leaders in Kolkata. If you want to go, the door is open,” Banerjee reportedly said during the videoconference on Friday.Her warning came in the wake of a series of incidents where senior party leaders, including ministers, were found criticising their colleagues.Reacting to the news of CM Banerjee’s warning to her party against corruption, Left and BJP leaders said it was nothing more than a mockery of the reality.“TMC is corrupt, top to bottom. Who listens to such things?” Sujan Chakraborty, the leader of the Left parties in the assembly, asked.“If she was concerned about corruption, she should have long ago acted against the corrupt filling up ranks in her party,” the BJP’s national secretary Rahul Sinha said.The TMC won 211 of the state’s 294 assembly seats, while BJP won only three in 2016 elections. However, the BJP emerged as the state’s principal opposition party in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, winning 18 of the 42 seats, while the TMC won 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/ahead-of-2021-state-polls-mamata-banerjee-warns-tmc-against-corruption-in-relief-work/story-7pCYYpSTU2EwG3mI8D8vFO.html
06-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police’s order for action against fake news is legal: Maharashtra govt||Justifying the Mumbai Police’s order that stipulates criminal action against anyone spreading false and fake information on social media, the Maharashtra government told the Bombay High Court that reasonable restrictions can be imposed to safeguard public order.A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Amjad Sayed was on Friday hearing two public interest litigations (PILs) challenging the legality of an order dated May 23, passed by the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Operations).The order said that action would be taken against any person, who spreads incorrect, fake information on social media.It further said that any person who holds the ‘Admin’ position of any social media group, shall be held personally liable for dissemination of any false or incorrect messages circulated in the group.According to the petitions filed by advocate Sheshanath Mishra and independent journalist and co-founder of NGO ‘Free Speech Collective’ Geeta Seshu, the order violates the rights of citizens guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India (right to freedom of speech and expression).Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, appearing for the government, however, contended that the order is “perfectly” legal in view of Article 19(2) of the Constitution, which authorises the government to impose reasonable restrictions upon freedom of speech and expression in the interest of public order.The court noted that the issue requires to be examined even though a plain reading of the order reveals that its validity is effective only till June 8, 2020 and directed the government to file an affidavit within three weeks.The petition filed by Mishra claimed that the police order aims to muzzle the voice of common citizens and prevent them from criticising the government’s handling of the pandemic.Seshu’s counsel Mihir Desai argued that the police have not followed due procedure prescribed under section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-s-order-for-action-against-fake-news-is-legal-maharashtra-govt/story-B2FHM7cXfBcTqvZzzJPB8L.html

The charge sheets were filed in the murder of two persons—Aqil Ahmed and Musharraf—whose bodies were recovered from the drain in Johripur.The police have charged 10 people for the murder of Ahmed, a mechanic, who was allegedly waylaid by the mob at Jal Board Puliya, Bhagirathi Vihar, and was murdered, while he was returning home at New Mustafabad on February 26.Police have also charged nine people for the murder of Musharraf, a labourer and auto driver, stating that the rioters dragged Musharaff out and bludgeoned him to death. The reports were filed before Duty Magistrate Richa Parihar who posted the matter for June 18, for cognizance.A senior police official said: “We recovered a phone of one of the accused , which showed a conversation on a WhatsApp group where one of the accused claimed they had killed two men. The reference was to Aqil Ahmed and Musharaaf. Since the chat messages were sent at the same time as the occurrence of incident, it is crucial evidence”. This person, who asked not to be named, added that “78 charge sheets have been prepared”.According to a police statement, four bodies were recovered after the violence near Johripur Nala following which four FIRs were filed. Investigation revealed that a “WhatsApp” group was created in the intervening night of February 25-26, with the alleged rioters as members. “Two active members of this WhatsApp group were located and joined in the investigation,” the police said.“Based on oral evidence and the WhatsApp chat, the identity of the perpetrators was fixed,” it added.

But what additional testing arrangements were made before the ban was imposed? The government should reveal its plan to increase testing in future. The situation in Delhi is constantly getting worse.”Gupta said that BJP will continue to raise these issues in the days to come. Meanwhile, an organisational reshuffle, which has been long overdue, is likely in the coming days. “We will put in place a new team soon. It will be a mix of new and old people. Our aim is reach out to all the sections, especially those living in slums and unauthorised colonies. These are area where we need to strengthen our cadre,” said Gupta.Senior BJP leaders say that Gupta is an old hand and is aware of the key issues. Shyam Jaju, in-charge of Delhi BJP, said, “It is a help to have someone who knows the cadre well. He has risen through the ranks. He knows the problem areas and will be able to fix those in no time.

06-06-2020||Delhi||Rain brings mercury levels down in Delhi||Thundershowers accompanied by lightning, gusty winds of up to 50 kmph were recorded in various parts of Delhi-NCR and north-west India on Friday. Light rain and cloudy skies are expected in Delhi -NCR and rest of the northern plains over the weekend also, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) authorities.The inclement weather is because of a western disturbance that is affecting the western Himalayas and moisture incursion due to cyclone Nisarga, which hit the Maharashtra coast on Wednesday. “Many places in NCR got thundershowers. Palam recorded wind speed of 50 kmph. Light rain and thunder is likely over the weekend. There is no forecast for a heatwave for some time now in Delhi. Maximum temperatures may rise by three to four degrees Celsius after Saturday, but we are not expecting a heat wave till June 15, and after that, a heat wave is unlikely. Delhi may get rains again after June 10 due to the likely formation of a low-pressure area over Bay of Bengal,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre. Thunderstorm accompanied by lightning, gusty wind over the north-western region during the next two days and some heavy rainfall is also very likely over Uttarakhand, eastern Uttar Pradesh and southern Rajasthan during the next 24 hours, IMD said in its Friday bulletin.Southwest monsoon has advanced into the central Arabian Sea, Kerala and Mahe and some parts of Karnataka.

06-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi plans to ramp up city’s Covid beds over three weeks||The Delhi government on Thursday finalised a plan according to which five government hospitals, dedicated to Covid-19 treatment in the city, will increase their cumulative bed capacity by 9,000 to 13,870, including 750 beds with ventilator support, in three phases over the next three weeks, officials said.Currently, these five hospitals together have around 4,500 beds and 300 ventilators to treat those infected with the SARS-CoV 2 virus.The augmentation plan – drafted after the city touched 1,000 Covid-19 cases in a single day on May 28 – requires the five hospitals to have 4,470 beds in the first phase (by June 11, which has already been met), 4,650 more in the second (by June 18) and another 4,750 in the third phase (by June 25), according to government documents that HT has seen. The five government hospitals are Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (2,170 beds), GTB Hospital (4,500 beds), Lok Nayak Hospital (6,000 beds), Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital (600 beds) and Satyavati Raja Harish Chandra Hospital (600 beds).Senior government officials said the five hospitals (with added space capacity) collectively will have to have 110 beds with ventilator support in the first phase, 270 ventilator-supported beds in the second and 370 such beds in the third.Of the 13,120 remaining beds (excluding those with ventilator support) under the augmentation plan, 9,880 beds must have oxygen facility of different capacities and 3,240 beds must be kept available for recovering patients whose health may need to be observed for a few days, the documents said.Between May 28 and June 4, Delhi recorded an average of 1,219 cases a day, the government records showed. The government is expecting a further spike in these numbers as Delhi’s economic activities and public spaces have opened up in a phased manner.On Friday, Delhi recorded 1,330 Covid-19 cases, taking the total to 26,334. The death toll went up to 708. Of the 15,311 active Covid-19 cases as on Friday, 10,255 are in home isolation.In another order issued earlier this week, the government directed all private hospitals with more than 50 beds to dedicate 20% of the total beds to Covid-19 patients. With this, the government hopes to add another 2,643 beds for Covid treatment at 42 private hospitals, another set of government documents showed.The order is applicable to 117 hospitals and nursing homes in the city built on land procured from the government at subsidised rates. But apart from the 42, the rest are yet to give estimates to the government, a senior official said.On Thursday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had said hospitals that fail to earmark 20% of their beds for Covid-19 treatment will have to offer up the entire hospital to combat the pandemic. The government has also allowed such hospitals to increase their total bed capacity by 25%.Currently, the city has 10 Covid-dedicated hospitals, which collectively provides around 4,000 beds and 130 ventilators. The hospitals are Max Super Speciality Hospital, Apollo Hospitsal, Sir Ganga Ram Kolmet Hospital, Sir Ganga Ram City Hospital, Mahadurga Charitable Trust Hospital, Batra Hospital, Fortis Shalimar Bagh, Venkateshwara Hospital, Moolchand Hospital and Saroj Super Speciality Hospital.Apart from these, the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium, Chhatrasal Stadium, Siri Fort Sports Complex, Saket Sports complex, more than 20 hotels and banquet halls have been identified by the revenue department as facilities that can be converted into Covid-19 hospitals or quarantine facilities, should the need arises, the senior official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-plans-to-ramp-up-city-s-covid-beds-over-three-weeks/story-khTKOZ5pnfC0x4Z8Ap3uwN.html
06-06-2020||City||Delhiwale: Staying at home, which is roadside||A man without a house. How could he possibly stay at home, like all of us citizens were repeatedly instructed to do during the beginning of the coronavirus-triggered lockdown?“This is my home,” muttered the grey-haired gentleman, while holed up one afternoon on a central Delhi roadside. He spoke his halting words in a rather uncertain tone, as if he were ready to be challenged for this assertion.Rakesh, as the man introduced himself, was lying on a threadbare carpet spread along the pavement like a bed sheet. His head was plopped up on a makeshift pillow rustled out of his chappals.He seemed at ease in a setting that, despite being so public, seemed very private, as if all these shaded trees, this green grass on the grounds beside the road, and the chirping of invisible birds were created for his comfort. Rakesh made it a point to disclose, without any prompting, that “once upon a time I used to live in Ambedkar Nagar, in a pakka kamra (concrete room).”This encounter took place in late March, just a couple of days before the lockdown began. By then people were already being exhorted to... well, stay at home.Rakesh faintly smiled and said he had heard of coronavirus and that he was scared of catching the infection. But then he looked up at the blue sky, while still lying down, and breezily said that “I’m still living and maybe God will look after me.”He had walked over to this spot an hour before, after having a lunch of dal-chawal at Sai Baba temple, some distance away. “I always have my day-time meal outside the mandir... it is served free there everyday to many people like me.”While walking to this spot, Rakesh said he had thought of “nothing except that I was tired and I wanted to lie down in some quiet place.”This particular stretch, a side-road that goes past Humayun’s Tomb, was completely quiet. Totally free of traffic at the moment of this interaction. There was nobody else except for a dog sitting atop an unknown person’s centuries-old stone grave.Rakesh informed he was a native of Ayodhya, in UP, and had been living in Delhi for some years. He requested the interlocutor not to urge him to talk about his past. Instead, he explained that he sometimes works as a waiter in wedding banquets and parties “but now all is over because of the bimari (sickness) and I have no work.” He stayed silent when asked to explain if he meant by ‘bimari’ some health problem he was suffering from, or the general threat of the coronavirus pandemic.He later got up, and sat cross-legged, casually clasping his palms. He spent the next few moments silently, and puzzlingly gazed upon his unusually long fingernails, as if they were lines of some difficult poem he was trying to understand.“I will now walk for some time... at night I will sleep by the road or under the flyover,” he said, rolling up his carpet. Soon he walked away.It’s been more than two months since then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhiwale-staying-at-home-which-is-roadside/story-QjVGnkgOzaP1IySToDNsiI.html

06-06-2020||Mumbai||Head constable tests positive for Covid after death; Mumbai Police toll at 20||A 54-year-old head constable posted at Dahisar police station who died on Thursday morning, was tested positive for coronavirus the same day at night. The head constable is a resident of MHB Colony in Borivli and is survived by his wife and 14-year-old son. With the head constable’s death, the death toll in Mumbai Police rose to 20.On May 27, the head constable went on leave after he developed fever and approached a physician for treatment. “The physician said he had viral fever and gave medicines. He recovered from the fever in two days, but on May 30, he could not breathe. We tried to get him tested at a private clinic, but the authorities said they have run out of forms for the tests and asked us to come next day,” the head constable’s wife said.On June 1, his health condition worsened, and he was in need of oxygen. He was admitted to Bhagwati Hospital and later shifted to Karuna Hospital – both of which are located in Borivli, where he passed away on Thursday after developing pneumonia.“Though he had diabetes, his blood sugar level was under control. He went for his duty despite the Mumbai Police permitting personnel above 50 years with pre-existing health conditions to go on leave,” the head constable’s wife said.She also alleged that there was delay in her husband’s leave sanction. “My husband wanted to go on leave from May 20, as he was unwell but was granted leave only on May 27,” she further alleged.However, Hanif Mujawar, senior inspector of Dahisar police, refuted the allegations. He said, ”He never made a formal application asking for a leave. If he had made an application I would have been surely updated about it.”This is the second death in Dahisar police. On May 26, a 53-year-old head constable died of respiratory ailments at JJ Hospital though he did not suffer from any pre-existing condition. A day later, he was found Covid-19 positive.Mujawar said aggressive testing would be conducted to prevent more deaths in the police force.1, 499 infected, 31 dead in state policeUntil Friday morning, the Maharashtra Police reported 1,499 active cases, –1,304 constables and 195 officers. The police force also lost 31 personnel to Covid-19. While 30 of them are constables and assistant sub-inspectors, one was a 32-year-old assistant police inspector who had diabetes and blood pressure.5 RPF personnel test positiveFive railway protection force (RPF) constables tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday, and seven more constables were home quarantined as a precautionary measure, said officers.On Monday, the five constables – staying at the RPF barrack at Carnac Bunder – went for tests after they developed Covid-119 symptoms. After their reports came positive, they were admitted to Jagjivan Ram Hospital at Mumbai Central, and their condition is stable, a statement issued by RPF revealed. The number of cases in RPF now stands at seven, even as a total of 18 personnel are home quarantined.Atul Pathak, inspector general of RPF (Central Railway), said,” We are closely monitoring every case to ensure the wellbeing of our staff. Personal care is very crucial to stay healthy. The staff are always sensitised about this aspect.”15 arrested for lockdown violationsThe Mumbai Police on Thursday lodged 12 first information reports (FIRs) against 27 people and arrested 15 for lockdown violations.

06-06-2020||City||Coronavirus pandemic: Panel advises devotees to reconsider Haj visit||Haj pilgrims were advised to cancel their applications to visit the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia and collect a complete refund of the amount paid by them earlier.The circular was issued by the Haj Committee of India (HCOI) on Friday, even as it awaits a notification from the Saudi Ministry of Haj as well as the Centre about the provisions for the pilgrims this year. HCOI said it is very difficult to make arrangements owing to the coronavirus pandemic and is thus advising pilgrims to avoid going on Haj.This year, around 1.75 lakh people were expected to leave for Hajj from India from June 25, of whom 1.25 lakh registered through HCOI, while around 50,000 through private tour operators (PTOs).Maqsood Ahmed Khan, chief executive officer of HCOI, said that owing to a lot of queries by pilgrims, the committee decided to issue a circular, asking pilgrims to cancel their visit. Khan added that the committee is of the opinion that it will be difficult to make arrangements for Hajj at a short notice. “On our end it is very difficult to make arrangements, and we would advise pilgrims to not go for Haj this year,” Khan said. “A cancellation charge of ₹5,000-7,000 was levied in previous years, but this year there will be no cancellation fee and a full refund will be given,” said Khan. Even if either of the governments cancel the pilgrimage altogether, those who applied for the visit will be provided with the refund, however it will be done so only within a year, Khan said. Zafar Jamal of Federation Haj PTOs of India said that by Ramzan, they fill their quota of 50,000 pilgrims. However, owing to the pandemic, this year only 30% of pilgrims registered with them.“We are awaiting details from the Saudi government, which is expected to be out on Saturday. Then we will take a call on what needs to be done. There may be a change in the quota and the pilgrimage may become even more expensive in that case. Even we would advice pilgrims to not to go for the pilgrimage this year,” said Jamal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-pandemic-panel-advises-devotees-to-reconsider-haj-visit/story-dKkbrtAd7zXvLes9yhN5GJ.html
06-06-2020||Mumbai||As Mumbai lifts lockdown restrictions, buyers allege shops flouted norms; no clarity over rules, say owners||Even as the state permitted shops and markets, other than those selling essential items, to operate from Friday on odd-even basis, shopkeepers claimed that there were no clear guidelines in place. As a result, many shops remained open in the first half of the day, leading to huge crowds at markets and traffic on roads, as well as violation of social distancing norms. “I went to a stationery shop today. Though there were only three people, none of them were wearing masks nor were they following social distancing norms. Also, in our area, shops were open on both sides of the road, owing to which there were scores of public on the streets. Some were having tea and samosas. With the other institutions also set to open from June 8 onwards, the number of cases will only increase drastically,” said a Ghatkopar resident, who did not wished to be named.Haren Mehta, a member of traders’ body Akhil Ghatkopar Vyapari Mandal, said some of the customers who visited his garment store on Friday were even shopping for small celebrations.“There is no concept of essential or non-essential items anymore. After 70 days of lockdown, everything becomes essential because people have run out of things. But this odd-even concept can cause further losses to businessmen, who are already suffering from the past two months,” said Mehta.Shopkeepers in the western suburbs said that while larger showrooms that cater to ethnic and traditional wear saw only one or two customers on Friday, there were huge crowds at stationery, toys, shoes and hardware stores.“Consumers are unsure about when the situation will normalise. So they are stocking up stationery, games and toys to keep their children busy, as well as home clothes. However, party wear, cosmetics and imitation jewellery shops did not get a good response as consumers consider them as non-essential items in current scenario,” said Shailesh Trivedi, who owns an ethnic wear showroom at Malad.Trivedi added that for cloth and garment showrooms, it would be difficult to abide by sanitisation and distancing norms..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/as-mumbai-lifts-lockdown-restrictions-buyers-allege-shops-flouted-norms-no-clarity-over-rules-say-owners/story-BeLQO4cwwXDy7ngQpLIMZN.html
06-06-2020||City||Day 1 of unlockdown: Mumbai doesn’t let its mask slip, shops with caution||Scores of buyers were seen thronging shops and markets in the city on Friday, Day 1 of reopening of shops and markets under the government’s Mission Begin Again to ease lockdown restrictions in Maharashtra.Garment stores, hosiery stores, bedsheets and curtain vendors, tailor shops, department stores, cake shops, chaat shops and kitchen-ware stores on one side of the road were open from 9am. Many street vendors also sold garments and footwear. Many areas, especially crowded parts of central and south central Mumbai, including Dadar, Parel, and Byculla, and the western and eastern express highway saw bumper-to-bumper traffic. Following the state’s announcement on May 31 to start ‘Mission Begin Again’ in three phases from June 3, June 5, and June 8, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation chief IS Chahal on June 2 issued a circular chalking out the ‘unlock plan’ for the city. As per this circular, from June 3, shops and markets have been allowed to remain open between 9am and 5pm. Trial rooms and exchange or return policies in stores will not be allowed. Malls and shopping complexes are not included in the plan. Taxis, auto-rickshaws, and private vehicles were allowed to ply from Friday. Sunita Joshi, chief facilitator of BMC’s shops and establishments department, said, “It is upto the wards to ensure social distancing rules are followed, and to take shut the shop if these rules are violated. Together with shop owners’ associations, wards have to draft a plan to implement the alternate (roads only on one side of the road to open) rule.” Many wards came out with circulars for crowd control in their areas, by listing out names of roads that will follow odd-even rules. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of G-North ward, which covers areas of Dadar, a popular shoppers’ zone, issued a circular asking all shops to shut down before 8pm, the state-imposed curfew timing.Viren Shah, president of the Federation of Retail Traders’ Welfare Association, said, “We have strictly asked shops to follow social-distancing rules, use sanitisers and masks. Individual shopkeeper, as well as area-wise associations, will monitor the situation.” Some goods were at a higher demand than others, and it will be some time before business takes off for certain goods. According to Shah, plumbing material, sanitation material, masks, umbrellas, raincoats, undergarments, nightwear, T-shirt, trackpants, baby products, toys, indoor games and kitchenware were in demand. Sarees, trousers, wedding outfits, designer wear and branded clothing saw very few takers.A shopper who was buying plastic water bottles from a kitchen-ware store in Dadar said, “I have not been able to refrigerate any water in summer. This purchase was pending for the past three months, as no shops sold water bottles.” Another shopper who was giving measurements to a tailor shop in Dadar, which is also a garment store, said, “I am trying to complete all chores that were pending for a few months now, one by one.”Shopkeepers are relieved to restart their business. A shopkeeper selling hosiery items said, “Business had come to a standstill for two months. I am not expecting many customers right away. But when people see my shop open, they will remember to come here if they need anything at another time.” Markets in Dahisar and Borivli were not crowded. Harish Pandey of New Link Road Association from Dahisar said, “There not much movement considering many housing societies have restrictions on timings to step out.”Lamington Road in south Mumbai, too, did not attract many buyers. Mahendra Hemdev, a shopkeeper from Lamington Road, said, “Most customers come to this market from far-off places. With local trains shut, very few could turn up.” Shops in Colaba also opened, but to very few customers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/day-1-of-unlockdown-mumbai-doesn-t-let-its-mask-slip-shops-with-caution/story-DbtAHpHB4gK6tvkQZePVoN.html

06-06-2020||Mumbai||E ward doubling rate is 42 days; BMC says because of testing||For the first time since March, the doubling rate of Covid-19 infection in a ward – E (Mumbai Central, Byculla, Kamathipura) – has increased to 42 days, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) data till Wednesday. The E ward has seen 2,775 cases till Thursday.The doubling time or rate is the number of days taken for the cases to double. The overall doubling time in the city is 20 days, higher than the country’s 16 days. The city’s average doubling rate was 11 days till May 24.While the data on number of cases in all wards is available till Thursday, the doubling rate numbers are as of Wednesday. Following the E ward is F-N ward (Dadar, Sion Koliwada) with 2,805 cases, where the doubling rate is 32 days. The G-S ward, which covers Mahalaxmi and Lower Parel, has 2,287 cases and the doubling rate is 30 days. The H-E ward that covers Santacruz has a doubling rate of 29 days, with 2,535 cases. The doubling rate of G-N ward, which recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai and includes India’s largest slum Dharavi, has increased to 27 days. The number of cases is 3,316.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner in-charge of G-S ward, said, “The change is because we have conducted aggressive testing of around 6,000 people, which helped us identify 1,541 positive cases. We managed to screen around 4.5 lakh people in all slum pockets. We have also placed more than 6,300 people under institutional quarantine. Private physicians joining hands with BMC in screening helped in early diagnosis.”Experts are not sure of the reasoning. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), testing is allowed only for people with symptoms, those with travel history, or contacts of infected people. However, as 80% of patients are asymptomatic, there is a possibility that a large number of patients are going undetected, which can decrease the doubling rate. “As we aren’t doing adequate number of tests, the doubling rate will increase. This data doesn’t provide a three-dimensional view of the situation in the city. It is just an eyewash while many patients are unidentified in the crowd,” Dr K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/e-ward-doubling-rate-is-42-days-bmc-says-because-of-testing/story-BMmkRlW7U5uqoP0Whno05J.html

06-06-2020||City||2 weeks of relaxations crucial: BMC||MUMBAIWith restrictions on shops and travel in the city and Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) eased on Friday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is expecting a surge in Covid-19 cases, especially if citizens don’t follow social distancing norms and other guidelines. Civic officials said the next two weeks would be crucial and they are bracing for all scenarios.On Friday, Mumbai saw 1,149 cases and 50 deaths, taking the count to 46,080 and toll to 1,519. Of the 46,080 cases, 25,768 are active cases. According to BMC, the recovery rate of the city as of Friday is 41%, death rate 3.3% and doubling rate is 20 days, from 12 days on May 15.Starting Friday, BMC allowed shops, markets to remain open on alternate days between 9am and 5pm daily, except Sundays. Owing to this, several parts of the city saw crowding on the streets, as the lockdown was relaxed after almost 80 days.While civic officials don’t rule out a spike, they haven’t worked out any estimate. Daksha Shah, deputy executive health officer of BMC, said, “We do not have fresh projections for the upcoming period, but in the next 10 days, we will know the trend. Our main focus is to control the cases in the slums, where the chances of spike are more. Overall, if we do not observe social distancing and follow all norms, there can be a surge in cases. We have been clear that those above 50 years of age or having other ailments should stay home and avoid coming out. However, the picture will be clear in the coming days.”BMC had in April anticipated that by the end of May Mumbai might have around 75,000 cases, however, it later revised the projection to 45,000 cases by the end of May. By May 31, Mumbai had less than 40,000 cases, which the BMC claimed was a result of its rigorous contact-tracing and focused testing. BMC officials said their efforts ensured the positivity rate went up to 20% as of Thursday, from 3% in the first week of April.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said they don’t have any projection like earlier, adding they will have to wait for the trend to emerge.In terms of preparation, the civic body plans to have close to 1 lakh beds identified, from the current 80,000+, by augmenting the capacity at Bandra-Kurla Complex, NESCO etc. Currently, the active beds are over 16,000 in Mumbai, followed by over 47,000 beds in Covid-Care Centres where high-risk contacts are quarantined.Ashwini Bhide, additional municipal commissioner of BMC, tweeted, “Our hospital bed capacity for Covid patients has increased from 3,500 beds to 9,000 beds in 45 days. Additional 8500+ beds are being available through Jumbo facilities. A total of 2,500 beds are ready and 900 more ICUs and ventilators are getting added.”Meanwhile, Madhav Sathe, microbiologist and former professor at Nair Hospital, said, “The exact trend after the relaxations may be known only after at least 10 to 15 days, but, overall, there is a slight chance of a spike. At the same time, I am optimistic, considering many are developing antibodies to fight the virus. The actual spike can only come when the lockdown is completely lifted and local trains start, but by that time a huge population of the city might have developed anti-bodies. Currently, it is said that around 18-20% of the population have developed anti-bodies. The complete lockdown will be lifted by government only after knowing the results of the current relaxations. If the spike, if any, can be handled, there might be further relaxations, and if not the same will prevail for a longer period.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-weeks-of-relaxations-crucial-bmc/story-jRuTjSc1pzlGkR4CciVjlO.html

They stated that two such incidents had been reported recently.A woman’s gold chain was snatched by miscreants in Ambedkar Nagar on May 27. In another incident, a thief took away parts of an electricity meter installed outside a flour mill in Ram Nagar on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday.The thief was caught on the CCTV installed outside the mill.Manpreet Singh Manna, who is a relative of area councillor Surinder Kaur, said, “While the MC has failed to get LED streetlights installed on the main roads, the old lights (sodium vapour lamps) have been lying defunct since December. We have told mayor Balkar Sandhu and MLA Surinder Dawar about the problem but to no avail.”The lights are lying defunct at various places including Mohar Singh Nagar Road, Benjamin Road, Khud Mohalla, and the road outside division number 2 police station.Alok Kumar, the flour mill owner, said, “The civic body should resolve the problem at the earliest as the residents are deeply troubled. They are afraid to even step out of their houses after sunset.”“A few days back, a gang of thieves stole mobile phones from one of the houses in the area. Even the CCTV cameras do not work properly in the dark,” he added.Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “I had conducted an inspection in the past and know that streetlights are lying defunct in different parts of the city.”“A meeting of the MC general house will be scheduled soon to take action against the Tata company, which has taken up the project to install LED street lights in the city,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-residents-protest-against-defunct-street-lights-distribute-candles/story-w09iVHw56EEfUtUE0xtiDO.html

06-06-2020||Mumbai||Cyclone Nisarga destroyed 1.5 lakh rare mangrove saplings at Raigad||Close to 1.5 lakh rare mangrove saplings and hundreds of trees were destroyed when cyclone Nisarga made landfall in Raigad district on June 3, said forest officials on Friday.The mangrove cell said the state-owned nursery at Akshi Creek, south of Alibag, was right in the path of the cyclone. The 28-acre nursery had rare species like Bruguiera cylindrica, Sonnertia alba, Rhizophora mucronata and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza.“This is the largest mangrove nursery in the district where sturdy mangrove species have been destroyed, showing the intensity of the cyclonic winds,” said Karishma Kawade, range forest officer (Alibag). “Full mangroves have been uprooted and found a few metres from they were originally located,” she said.Damage to isolated patches of mangrove were also reported from the coastal tehsils of Alibag, Murud, Tala, Mhasala, and Srivardhan. Mangrove cell officers from Raigad said Avicennia marine, the most common mangrove species along the Maharashtra coast, were damaged along creek ends.Mangroves are a natural buffer, shielding landward areas against cyclones and rising sea levels. Raigad has the maximum mangrove cover and accounts for almost 40% of Maharashtra’s mangrove area (121 sq. km of 302 sq. km). “While the trees faced the major impact of the cyclone landfall, their protection and presence reduced the impact on property and livelihood during the cyclone,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell).Phansad Wildlife Sanctuary, spread across 6,979 hectares in Raigad district, recorded more than 200 tree fall cases in addition to 1.10 lakh tree fall cases reported from village and semi urban areas. “A preliminary assessment shows there has been massive damage to the bird habitat in Phansad where thousands of nests have been destroyed as this was the nesting season,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra. So far, there are no reports of animal casualties or injuries due to the cyclone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cyclone-nisarga-destroyed-1-5-lakh-rare-mangrove-saplings-at-raigad/story-qFxpCRVNyzVnxaQqZqAYKN.html
06-06-2020||Mumbai||Flamingos make their way to Panje wetland, first time this year||For the first time this year, flamingos have made their way to the endangered Panje wetlands in Uran.The Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) confirmed that flocks of flamingos had made their way to Panje between Thursday and Friday. “The impact of severe cyclone Nisarga and heavy rain in the Uran region had scattered flamingos from congregated habitats and most likely moved them to this open space in Panje, reinstating the fact that it is an important wetland,” said Deepak Apte, director, BNHS.Spread across 213-hectare (ha) core and 157 ha buffer area for migratory bird roosting, Panje holds up to 1,50,000 birds (migratory and resident) during winters.While there have numerous reports of lesser flamingos spotted at Talawe wetlands, Panje remained dry throughout this year, as most of the high tide inlets to the site had blocked by construction, said environmentalists alleging that work for the Navi Mumbai Special Economic Zone was allowing environmental violations to happen. “It is a delightful sight to see these birds return, but the area continues to face threats as the local police are stopping the fishing community from entering Panje. The site needs immediate protection,” said Nandkumar Pawar, environmentalist.Ornithologist and naturalist Sunjoy Monga said he had received reports of about 1,000 to 1,200 flamingo numbers at Panje. “There is no reason that the state can provide for not declaring Panje and Talawe as sanctuaries or conservation reserves anymore. The events this year stand testimony of why they need to be protected,” he said.Meanwhile, the City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd. (Cidco) said protecting Panje was not under their jurisdiction anymore. “The area belongs to NMSEZ and any decision regarding its protection or destruction is in their hands, not ours,” said Pramod Patil, nodal officer (environment), Cidco.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/flamingos-make-their-way-to-panje-wetland-first-time-this-year/story-hwcGFgsVSx5BlHqjxm7WwJ.html

As the number of Covid-related deaths is rising, the disease has claimed more than 30 lives in the twin cities. As per the protocols, the bodies are wrapped in three-layer plastic suits while being cremated and during the process, some of the molten plastic jams the mechanical parts of the conveyer and other systems inside the compartment, causing technical issues, said a Mira Bhayandar Municipal Corporation (MBMC) officer. To stop the spread of coronavirus infection, the three-layer plastic suits are not opened and are directly burnt, he said.The gas-based crematoriums reduce the waiting time and the funeral rites are completed in less than an hour compared to the traditional method of using wood, etc which take around three hours and cause pollution, said Hasmukh Gehlot, deputy mayor, MBMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lpg-fired-crematoriums-develop-technical-snag-in-mira-bhyander/story-DnN3qWW10YrMeneZSi8DJP.html

06-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai is second on global list of coastal cities at risk||Future climate projections show that among 136 coastal cities across the world, Mumbai is second-most at risk to climate-induced sea level rise and extreme weather events. Guangzhou in China tops the list and Kolkata was identified as seventh-most at risk. A study of the economic impact of inundation was carried out by researchers from Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3) in Spain, and Oxford University, London School of Economics, and Liverpool Oceanographic Centre in the United Kingdom. They assessed projected damages and suggested graded solutions for worst-case scenarios in their report. Titled “Comparing urban coastal flood risk in 136 cities under two alternative sea-level projections”, the study was recently published in the international peer-reviewed journal Ocean and Coastal Management. “We found that Guangzhou followed by Mumbai and New Orleans (in Louisiana, USA) face the highest risks in both scenarios among 136 global coastal cities,” said Elisa Sainz de Murieta, corresponding author from BC3, in an e-mail interview to Hindustan Times. She stressed the importance of identifying measures that are appropriate to the specific needs of each city. “It is essential to avoid damages to households and main infrastructures, but it is also important to understand that risk will increase with time,” said Sainz de Murieta.Annual average damages to property and livelihood in Mumbai could exceed US $100 billion in 2050, in the absence of strong mitigation and adaptation efforts due to increasing risks. This may further rise to $328 billion by 2070 and $734 billion by 2100. These projections were made under a standard assessment scenario of RCP8.5 and 1m global sea rise, said the study. RCP, representative concentration pathway, is a measure of greenhouse gas concentration and RCP8.5 imagines a worst-case scenario in the absence of climate-change policies.Sainz de Murieta clarified that the scenarios they’ve studied are “pessimistic”. “A scenario compatible with the Paris Agreement would translate in a global sea-level rise of 26-55 cm by 2100. RCP8.5 is a pessimistic scenario that could reach 4.3 degree Celsius temperature increase as compared to the pre-industrial era,” she said, adding that the second scenario considers a more dramatic situation based on larger contributions to global climate change. “These are not the most likely scenarios, but show how climate change could impact coastal cities if mitigation commitments are not ambitious enough to comply with targets,” said Sainz de Murieta.The report comes at a time when Nisarga, classified as a severe cyclone, struck the Maharashtra coast as one of the strongest cyclones since 1891. Though its impact on the country’s financial capital was limited, it brought to the fore the need for Mumbai to set up measures to tackle such events in the future. Analysis of a second scenario with increased risk predicted damages could be 2.8 times more than the current estimates for Mumbai, highlighting annual average losses of US $245 billion by 2050, US$636 billion by 2070, and US $1,355 by 2100, with larger contribution of faster-melting of ice sheets. “Our intent was to highlight that often only likely damages are considered and we ignore those risks that have a small probability. However, as the Covid-19 situation has shown, having a small probability does not mean it cannot happen. We argue that this information could be used, for example, for stress testing measures or infrastructures, but it should be taken as a warning and should not be ignored,” said Sainz de Murieta.The paper suggests authorities analyse the impact of disaster projections and build adaptive measures that keep in mind worst-case scenarios. The other option was providing co-benefits, said Sainz de Murieta. “For example, mangroves protection, which in addition to coastal protection offer additional services like supporting livelihoods and improving biodiversity. Preventive measures, such as early warning systems and social protection policies are also cost-effective options,” she said.City-based independent experts said increasing frequency of storms, cyclones and extreme weather events are all connected directly and indirectly to climate change, and therefore likely to increase. “All these cumulatively have severe impact on humans and land. After all, all that happens on land is a direct attribute of what happens in oceans since the latter governs most of the climate and not the land,” said marine biologist Deepak Apte.Environmentalists said Mumbai’s coastal road, Navi Mumbai International Airport, and the underground Metro-3 project were examples of projects that were planned without considering the impact of the rising sea level. “In addition to curbing mangrove destruction, such unplanned projects make us more vulnerable to such disasters,” said environmentalist Debi Goenka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-is-second-on-global-list-of-coastal-cities-at-risk/story-aZVUw4vmeqsJ28Bc6en0XL.html
06-06-2020||Mumbai||Cancel board exams, Yuva Sena writes to CBSE, ICSE heads||Shiv Sena’s student wing Yuva Sena has written to the heads of Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) boards demanding the cancellation of Class 10 and 12 board exams which are scheduled to take place in July. “Students are under a lot of stress due to the current crisis and rescheduling exams is only going to add to the pressure. We have requested both the boards to cancel the remaining papers, and mark students on the basis of their previous performance in internal assessments,” said Sainath Durge, core team member of Yuva Sena. On June 3, the state government wrote to the heads of these boards requesting them not to conduct exams in July as per the schedule and push them further or to mark students on the basis of their internal evaluation for the entire year. While eight papers of ISC (Class 12) exam have been rescheduled, six papers of ICSE (Class 10) have been pushed further. As per the board’s revised schedule, the papers for ICSE would now be held between July 2 and 12 while ISC exams would be held between July 1 and 14. Similarly, CBSE announced that all the remaining papers for Class 12 would be conducted between July 1 and July 15. Parents said it would be fair to cancel exams altogether. “Especially in a city like Mumbai, the risk would remain for the next few months and we don’t want our children to take all that stress,” said a parent from Andheri. On Saturday, state government officials and heads of both boards would meet virtually to arrive at a decision in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cancel-board-exams-yuva-sena-writes-to-cbse-icse-heads/story-UIoPHGLAklO3kgO9f7AmaO.html
06-06-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra spent ₹330 crore to send migrant labourers home: State to HC||The state government on Friday informed the Bombay high court (HC) that it arranged 822 Shramik special trains and numerous buses for migrant labourers who wished to return to their home states during the lockdown, till June 1. The state, in its affidavit sought by the court on the procedure and number of migrants sent back, informed the court that it had spent around ₹210 crore towards food packets and drinking water, ₹97.69 crore towards train fare and ₹21 crore towards bus fare while sending migrant labourers back to their native states through the Shramik special trains and buses free of cost. The state submitted that as the lockdown was being lifted in a phased manner and industries were starting to function there was no more need for Shramik special trains and buses anymore.The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice AA Sayyed, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Centre of Trade Union and others, was informed by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that the state government, along with local civic authorities and NGOs, had ensured that the needs of migrant labourers stranded in the city and state were taken care of adequately.Kumbhakoni informed the court that the procedure adopted for sending back migrant labourers through Shramik special trains and buses had been initiated since the end of April. Migrants wanting to return to their native places were asked to fill up a form provided at the local police station through a leader. On receiving sufficient applications, the state sent a request to the concerned state to permit the applicants to return home. The state further added that while awaiting the responses of the states, which took time, the migrants were kept in relief camps where they were provided with food, water and medical screening free of cost. The affidavit further stated that the migrants were given fod packets and water for their journey in trains and buses as well. Kumbhakoni concluded his statement saying that after June 1, there was no need for any more Shramik trains as industries were becoming operational and normal train services were resumed, hence migrants could avail those services if they wished to return to their home states.After hearing the submissions, the court sought to know if the petitioner had a rejoinder to the state affidavit and permitted them time till Tuesday (June 9) when the matter will be heard again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-spent-330-crore-to-send-migrant-labourers-home-state-to-hc/story-2PzLRi6gu4MjCM5Erv4DdI.html

06-06-2020||Mumbai||CM Uddhav Thackeray visits cyclone-hit Raigad, announces ₹100 crore for immediate relief work||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday visited areas affected by Cyclone Nisarga at Alibag in Raigad district and announced ₹100 crore for immediate relief work after holding review meetings. Eight of the 15 tehsils in Raigad district, which was the worst hit by the cyclone on Wednesday, are still without electricity and telephone connectivity, and roads leading to them have been blocked owing to tree falls. Hundreds of villages in Harihareshwar, Diveagar and Shrivardhan, where the cyclone made landfall, have been witnessed massive destruction, with people losing their houses. Thackeray said the Rs100-crore fund was being released to enable the administration to extend immediate relief for basic needs of citizens. He said officials have been told to arrange for food and shelter for villagers who have lost their houses. “This is not a package, but an immediate relief to deal with issues being faced. The actual relief package will be announced once the spot assessment is completed and the quantum of losses is finalised,” said Thackeray after interacting with some of the affected villagers. “Not only Raigad, but even other districts will be given assistance. Villagers have been asked to send photographs of the damage to their houses to enable officials to complete the survey at the earliest.” Thackeray also directed the energy department to deploy additional workforce from other districts for restoring electricity, following which the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) formed teams headed by executive engineers at its Bhandup, Kalyan, Nerul and Kolhapur divisions to be sent to Raigad. “We have been in darkness for three days. The environment, too, has suffered a huge loss with more than two lakh trees being uprooted. Around 15,000 electricity and other poles have collapsed. We have been able to clear the national and state roads, but are finding it difficult to clear interior roads. We need more manpower and machinery in the district,” said Padmashree Bainade, resident deputy collector of Raigad. Bainade said the relief announced by the state will be utilised for repairing and rebuilding damaged houses. “More than one lakh houses have been damaged in the district. Our priority is to release the funds that will help people start repair works,” she said. Meanwhile, two teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and three teams of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) are in Raigad to clear the roads. “Till Friday evening, 536 trees, 87 electric poles and 243km of roads in Raigad were cleared,” said Sachidanand Gawde from NDRF, Pune. “By tomorrow [Saturday], we will have an estimate as to how many more days will we needto ensure complete restoration.”Thackeray later met Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar in Mumbai and discussed various issues, including relief package for cyclone-hit citizens and measures to be taken while extending lockdown relaxations in the state. Pawar, according to leaders from NCP, discussed the quantum of the relief package that is expected to be announced next week. NCP leader and MP from Raigad, Sunil Tatkare, had submitted a memorandum to Pawar on Thursday, stating the losses are worth more than ₹5,000 crore. “Pawar has taken stock of the situation from all cyclone-hit districts after party ministers visited almost all the affected districts over the past two days. He wants the relief to be announced immediately. Once the estimated figures of losses are submitted by district authorities by Monday, the relief package is expected to be finalised by the cabinet next week,” said a NCP leader, who did not want to be named.Thackeray, meanwhile, said the decision over approaching the Centre for aid, will be taken after the assessment of damages is completed. “Union home minister Amitji Shah held a video conference ahead of the cyclone, while Prime Minister Narendraji Modi spoke to me twice. They have assured us all support in combating the calamity. After assessing the quantum of losses, the state will decide on approaching the Centre for financial assistance,” said the CM.While praising the people of Raigad, for bravely facing the cyclone, Thackeray said they should not forget that the crisis of coronavirus is not yet over. He said there was a possibility of cases rising during monsoon and people should also be careful of the potential threat of monsoon-related diseases. However, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who visited Maval on Friday, said the state has sought Central government’s assistance and a Central team will visit the state to assess damages. “Raigad and Pune have faced major damages. We will hold a meeting with elected representatives and district officials to decide on relief measures,” Pawar said. CM takes ro-ro service to Alibag Three months after it was inaugurated, the roll-on/roll-off (ro-ro) service made a trip from Ferry Wharf in Mumbai to Mandwa in Alibag, when chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, environment minister Aaditya Thackeray and other government officials visited Raigad on Friday. While the service was inaugurated on March 15, the ro-ro passenger ferry could make only a few trips before the lockdown was announced in the state on March 23. The large passenger-vehicle transport ship can carry 145 vehicles and 500 passengers during a single trip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-uddhav-thackeray-visits-cyclone-hit-raigad-announces-100-crore-for-immediate-relief-work/story-ou21WYXgYcbMa70ZMjoxwO.html

Of these, 4,42,717 people tested negative.Maharashtra’s fatality rate has increased to 3.55% (2,849 deaths on June 5) from 3.27% (1,792 deaths on May 26).

However, there is no classification of travel for essential requirements. Uber said the passenger will be required to carry documentation as proof of purpose of travel, whereas Ola has stated that no documentation will be required. The cabs will operate with only two passengers. Earlier, mobile app-based cab services in the city were available for only emergency commuting such as travel to hospitals, railway stations and airports. “Along with Mumbai, Ola will also be offering its services across major cities in the state such as Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Solapur and Amravati. Citizens across these cities will be able to book both city and outstation trips; intra-state only for essential travel needs,” read a statement from Ola. Both the cab aggregators have introduced compulsory safety and hygiene standards including wearing of mask by both passengers and drivers inside the vehicle, deep sanitisation of cabs before and after the rides. Ola will also set up zones where cabs will be fumigated and drivers will be screened every two days. Services of these online taxi aggregators were suspended in March in view of the pandemic.Fliers can use cabs to and from airportPassengers flying to and from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) will now be able to get pick up and drop facilities. Due to safety measures, the airport had restricted the movements of private cabs since May 25, however, it resumed the same from Friday. “CSMIA understands growing concerns among passengers for safe transport once they exit the airport. The airport has thus placed stringent measures to screen drivers and fumigate prepaid taxis and local cabs entering the airport premise. The airport has deployed a team for the same,” said airport operator Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL). An MIAL spokesperson said, “Drivers will undergo thermal checks and will be provided with an informative pamphlet detailing guideline on social distancing and sanitisation by the airport executives. In the event of the driver recording a higher temperature, the driver will be asked to undergo medical consultation, and his details will be entered in the records by the airport executive.” MIAL said with the relaxation of lockdown norms in the city and revival of services of prepaid taxis and local cabs, the airport is allowing Ola, Uber, Meru, black and yellow taxis to operate to and from the airport but with stringent measures.

06-06-2020||Chandigarh||Centre releases ₹2,866 crore as GST compensation to Punjab||Amid the coronavirus crisis, the Punjab government has received some financial relief as the Centre on Friday released ₹2,866 crore as goods and services tax (GST) compensation to the cash-strapped state.The amount, which has been given for the months of December 2019, and January and February 2020, is compensation for revenue losses incurred by the state government due to implementation of the GST regime. The fund release is expected to provide much-needed relief to the state which has been reeling under a huge dip in tax and non-tax revenues due to the coronavirus-induced national lockdown.“The GST compensation was pending and the government had made repeatedly requests the Union finance ministry for its release,” a senior official said. The Centre had on Thursday night announced the release of compensation of ₹36,400 crore to the state and union territories. Under the new indirect tax regime, the states have been guaranteed a 14% year-on-year growth in their GST revenue over the financial year 2015-16 base and they are to be compensated by the central government for any shortfall. Punjab’s monthly protected state-GST, which was ₹1,567 crore and ₹1,787 crore in financial years 2017-18 and 2018-19 respectively, stood at ₹2,037 per month in 2019-20 after the guaranteed year-over-year increase.Punjab has been among the states with the highest shortfall in revenue collection so far and dependent on compensation to some extent. However, the state government has managed to pay salaries to its employees, release funds to local bodies and incur additional expenditure on Covid-19 management despite the financial constraints.The state authorities have been relying on market borrowings to meet the spending needs in the past three months, auctioning the government securities worth ₹4,600 crore this year so far. Of this, a sum of ₹1,600 crore was raised by the state on June 2 through its 10-year paper. Last month, the centre also allowed a reforms-linked increase in borrowing limits to states from 3% to 5% of gross state domestic product (GSDP) for 2020-21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/centre-releases-2-866-crore-as-gst-compensation-to-punjab/story-1QbKsFGEKqkYueDEkO4PVM.html
06-06-2020||Mumbai||Societies start framing rules for house help to resume work||Several big housing societies across the city which had suspended the services of household help for residents when the lockdown began have now started framing rules to allow the entry of helps and drivers in their premises. However, many smaller housing societies are yet to take a call on the matter. Some are awaiting decision from the management on whether helps can be allowed again.The development comes as the Maharashtra government on Thursday announced Unlock 1.0 after two months of lockdown and set some guidelines to be followed in the state.However, some societies in south Mumbai fear that it will be difficult for them to find help as many household workers have left for their hometowns. “There is a shortage of people because a lot of them have left for their hometowns. Also, as transportation is shut currently, we will need to find people from vicinity which will be difficult,” said Sanjay Dube, chairperson of the managing committee of Ashok Gardens society at Sewri.Dube added that as of now maids haven’t resumed their services, but the committee will be forming an advisory on the basis of government protocol which will include sanitisation, separate entrance and elevators for maids as well as social distancing norms. “As of now, we might have drivers and car cleaners resuming in a day or two without being allowed to go up to the flats,” said Dube.Bhavin Mavani, secretary of Raheja Vistas Co-operative Housing Society at Chandivli, said as of yet they haven’t received requests from residents to allow maids in society premises. Before the lockdown, maids and other helps from the society were trained to maintain basic hygiene before the pandemic broke out.Currently, the society has decided to allow only full-time helps, whereas the entry of drivers and cleaners has been restricted to parking area.“Even for those who want to get full-time help to stay with them, we have asked for a fitness certificate and are checking that they do not come from containment zones. Even after they enter the society, they have to be quarantined for 14 days,” said Mavani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/societies-start-framing-rules-for-house-help-to-resume-work/story-oGaLFjUWnJHO4mPTst0F5N.html

06-06-2020||Mumbai||Now, tenants demand house owners to reduce rent||In the backdrop of the Covid-19 crisis which had resulted in job losses and pay cuts, many tenants are now demanding house owners to revise their leave and license agreements in favour of lower rentals.This year, forget the annual increase in rentals, the existing tenants and house owners are back on the negotiation table discussing the lowering of rents.According to Ashutosh Verma, who is a senior executive in a multinational firm, a 30% pay cut in his May salary has disrupted his monthly budget. “It is a very insecure job market and I am forced to cut down on expenses. I will shift to another place if the rent in which I am currently staying is not reduced,” said Verma. Verma who has rented an apartment in a high-end gated community complex in Parel is paying Rs 1.25 lakh as rent and has asked for its reduction. Owners too have acknowledged the issue and have started the process.Flat owner Chandramohan Sharma, who has given his 3-BHK apartment on rent at Juhu says that he is ready to reduce his rent by Rs 20,000. “I had given my apartment [on rent] for Rs 90,000 per month and now I am willing to reduce it to Rs 70,000. However, the tenant is insisting that he will not pay more than Rs 50,000 monthly,” said Sharma.Due to the Covid-19 lockdown, companies and businessmen have suffered great losses. Many companies have reduced the salaries of their employees and have also started terminating the jobs.Vishal Kadrekar, proprietor, Fair Value Property, a well-known brokerage firm, said that more than a dozen tenants have approached him demanding that their current agreements be revised. “Tenants are complaining that they will not be able to afford the existing rents in the current situation and hence we have opened talks with the owners,” said Kardekar. Kardekar said that this will continue throughout the year. “Owners will have to settle for lower rents as the economic situation is bad and tenants will be very cautious on renting apartments with higher rents,” he added. According to Liases Foras, a real estate research firm, there are at least 5.50 lakh houses in Mumbai that are put on rent. “The condition of the rental market will only worsen in the coming days especially due to job losses and salary cuts. There will be a reduction in rentals,” said Pankaj Kapoor, CEO, Liases Foras.In Mumbai, rentals for a 1-BHK house will start from Rs 15,000, 2-BHK from Rs 25,000 onwards and 3-BHK Rs 35,000 onwards and go till Rs 1.50 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/now-tenants-demand-house-owners-to-reduce-rental/story-bRWccD9p9A7YE1MD89KOvK.html

06-06-2020||Chandigarh||Centre’s agri marketing reforms attack on federal structure: Captain Amarinder Singh||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday rejected the “so-called” agricultural marketing reforms approved by the Centre two days ago, dubbing them as yet another brazen attempt to erode the federal structure of the country.The CM warned that these changes could pave the way for disbanding the minimum support price (MSP) regime as well as the foodgrain procurement system, triggering unrest among the state’s farmers. “The present system has been working successfully for almost 60 years. We will not allow this. Agriculture is a state subject. This is encroachment of federal structure. We will challenge it,” he told reporters at a press conference held via video-conferencing.Amarinder said the Centre’s habit of taking sudden decisions and forcing them on states, without taking their views into account, was violative of the federal framework. The Union cabinet had on Wednesday given its approval to three ordinances to remove cereals, pulses, oilseeds, onion and potato from the list of essential commodities and also allow the farmers to sell their produce directly or through e-trading to buyers of their choice, instead of remaining confined to mandis.Amarinder, in his first reaction to these changes, strongly opposed the move, stating that if farmers from several other states start coming to mandis in Punjab to sell their produce because of better price, where the local farmers would go? “The fees collected by the mandi board from procurement are used for constructing link roads and other development works. These will be affected,” he said.The CM said that Punjab would fight any steps to weaken the federal structure of the country through such direct and detrimental interference in the well-established agriculture produce marketing system of the state. “The Centre has no powers to make any legislation to deal with the dynamics of agricultural production, marketing and processing,” he later added in a statement, describing the Farming Produce, Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020, as a “highly ill-conceived” move.KISHOR KEEN TO WORK WITH CONG, NOT IN TALKS WITH SIDHU OR AAPAmarinder said that (political strategist) Prashant Kishor had expressed willingness to work with the Congress for the 2022 state assembly polls in Punjab. “Kishor and I are very close. He is like a family member. I talked to Kishor and he said he will be quite happy to come and help,” he said, denying reports that the political strategist had turned down the Congress request to help shape its poll campaign.The CM said he had discussed the matter with Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who left the decision (on Kishor) to him. “Before talking to Kishor, I took the party MLAs into confidence and 55 of the 80 legislators are in favour of bringing him in,” he said. Amarinder further said that Kishor also denied being in any talks with Congress MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu for his entry into the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). “Sidhu is very much a part of the Congress and has been in touch with the party leadership,” he said. Political circles have been abuzz with talk of Kishor approaching Sidhu, who quit the state cabinet last year following differences with the CM, to join the AAP. Both Sidhu and Kishor have kept mum so far. ‘KEEN TO CONTEST 2022 POLLS’ The two-time CM also reiterated his intention to contest the next assembly polls, but said the decision on leading the party rested with the Congress president. He had earlier called the 2017 battle his last election.SIT TO PROBE ILLICIT LIQUOR TRADEThe CM also announced the constitution of a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the illicit sale and smuggling of liquor during the lockdown period. The three-member SIT will be headed by water resources minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, he said in response to a query.Agreeing that such large-scale illicit sale of liquor and smuggling from other states could not have been possible without the involvement of some insiders, Amarinder promised action against all those involved. “Liquor was sold illegally during curfew. I have got a report on all illegalities committed by liquor vends and distilleries,” he said, waving a sheaf of papers.On the seed scam, he said there were clear indications that spurious seeds were sold. “The PAU had produced nearly 3,000 quintals of PR 128 and 129 varieties of paddy seed on trial basis, whereas 30,000 quintals had been sold in the open market to farmers by unscrupulous dealers. This clearly indicated that spurious seeds were also mixed to these new varieties to fleece innocent farmers,” he said, adding that the SIT headed by an ADGP-level officer would get to the bottom of the scam.GOVT TO APPEAL AGAINST HC ORDER ON SCHOOL FEEChief minister Capt Amarinder Singh said the state government will appeal against the high court ruling allowing private schools to charge fee from students for the lockdown period. He also ruled out opening of the schools without getting a clean chit from medical experts. “I will not compromise the health of children at any cost,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/centre-s-agri-marketing-reforms-attack-on-federal-structure-captain-amarinder-singh/story-rHZsNfkOsQ6mIX550GiKuK.html
06-06-2020||Chandigarh||No compromise on MSP: SAD president Sukhbir Badal||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Friday said that his party will never compromise on the issue of Minimum Support Price (MSP) and assured marketing for farmers produce, especially for paddy and wheat. In a coordination meeting with the BJP on Thursday, SAD had conveyed to the saffron party’s Punjab unit that his party will go to any extent to fight for the country’s federal structure and interests of the farmers. Sukhbir had also expressed displeasure over certain decisions taken by the Union cabinet.“SAD will never tolerate any deviation from the principle of assured marketing and MSP,” reiterated Sukhbir in a media address, claiming that he had already ensured that there’s no compromise on federalism, Sikh panth, Punjab’s interests and the farmers as these formed the four pillars on which the edifice of the SAD stood. “We have ensured that this regime will continue in its present form, in addition to opening up new possibilities and creating new platform to increase competition for the farmers’ produce,” he added.The former deputy chief minister also lashed out at what he claimed was the anti-farmer, anti-Punjab and anti-Panth Congress party for creating confusion on the issue of farmers interests. “Amarinder Singh’s only contribution to Punjab, Panth and the farmers has been his betrayal of all three by breaking the sacred promises made to them on oath of the sacred scriptures. The only thing he will be remembered after 2022 is the withdrawal of the free power facility to farmers during his last tenure as the CM,” he claimed. “Our workers and leaders have spent lifetimes fighting against the Congress repression and injustice against Punjabis in general and the Sikhs and peasants in particular. We will continue to follow the policy of zero tolerance of any step that hurts Punjabis, the Sikhs and the farmers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-compromise-on-msp-sad-president-sukhbir-badal/story-WSnOijpoIuxXyzw4X1WFBM.html

He also increased the number of meetings with the public at his residence to either help with ration or providing medical equipment for covid-19 frontline warriors. He shoots these interactions and uploads them on his own YouTube channel, Jittega Punjab (Punjab Will Win) that he launched on March 14, or on twitter. “The channel is meant to air and share his views with the people of Punjab in a simple and understandable form,” he had said at the launch. His twitter followers, at 6.8 lakh, outnumber the 37,000-odd subscribers to his YouTube channel. A team of professionals runs his social media presence. In some videos, he is seen targeting the Congress’ present regime in Punjab indirectly, saying the ‘fight against system is still going on’.On the recent row over liquor policy, he has shared his old videos of press conferences and speeches where he expresses dissent against the state government. He, however, has not posted any fresh material expressing dissent, and continues to maintain his distance with the media. On Wednesday late evening, he posted a fresh video in the form of a documentary film to depict his political career.His wife, Navjot Kaur Sidhu, though, has been more vocal. On the recent hike in MBBS fee in the state, she had tweeted on Thursday, “Shame on the government who forces doctors to protest by sitting on roads. Doctors should refuse to treat such leaders who have no respect for them. Bound to happen when decision makers are not so educated. Only toppers from all professions should be eligible for fighting elections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/incommunicado-for-months-sidhu-ramps-up-presence-in-lockdown/story-WsGJ527zs5RGThTvkq5eSI.html
06-06-2020||City||Ludhiana woman may have set her husband on fire before immolating herself: Police||Three days after a senior couple allegedly set themselves on fire at their house in Haibowal on June 2, police suspect it was not a suicide pact and the woman first immolated her husband and then herself.While the woman, Chanchal Jain, 60, had died, her husband, Sunil Jain, 65, had suffered 80% burns and continues to struggle for his life at a hospital.Police said preliminary investigation revealed that Chanchal was depressed as her husband was paralysed and bed-ridden, and she also used to frequently quarrel with her two daughters-in-law.Sub-inspector Kuldeep Singh, SHO, Haibowal police station said while the couple’s two sons and their wives were living on the ground floor, they lived on the first floor of the house.The SHO said following the questioning of all family members, they had found that Chanchal was depressed due to her husband’s failing health.Besides, spats between her and her daughters-in-law were a routine affair. They quarrelled even on Tuesday morning, hours before the self-immolation, and the police were even called in.But, the cops had left after issuing them a warning and on taking an assurance from the trio that they’ll live cordially.The SHO said prima facie it appeared Chanchal first set her bed-ridden husband on fire and then immolated herself. Police are waiting to a take statement from Sunil, who remains critical.“We have initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure following the statements of the family members,” the SHO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-woman-may-have-set-her-husband-on-fire-before-immolating-herself-police/story-psipwCSRPvc1ttTpfx0FkI.html
06-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt tells five Covid hospitals to augment bed strength in three weeks||The Delhi government on Thursday finalised a plan according to which five government hospitals, dedicated to Covid-19 treatment in the city, will increase their cumulative bed capacity by 9,000 to 13,870, including 750 beds with ventilator support, in three phases over the next three weeks, officials said.Currently, these five hospitals together have around 4,500 beds and 300 ventilators to treat those infected with the SARS-CoV 2 virus.The augmentation plan – drafted after the city touched 1,000 Covid-19 cases in a single day on May 28 – requires the five hospitals to have 4,470 beds in the first phase (by June 11, which has already been met), 4,650 more in the second (by June 18) and another 4,750 in the third phase (by June 25), according to government documents that HT has seen.The five government hospitals are Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (2,170 beds), GTB Hospital (4,500 beds), Lok Nayak Hospital (6,000 beds), Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital (600 beds) and Satyavati Raja Harish Chandra Hospital (600 beds).Senior government officials said the five hospitals (with added space capacity) collectively will have to have 110 beds with ventilator support in the first phase, 270 ventilator-supported beds in the second and 370 such beds in the third.Of the 13,120 remaining beds (excluding those with ventilator support) under the augmentation plan, 9,880 beds must have oxygen facility of different capacities and 3,240 beds must be kept available for recovering patients whose health may need to be observed for a few days, the documents said.Between May 28 and June 4, Delhi recorded an average of 1,219 cases a day, the government records showed. The government is expecting a further spike in these numbers as Delhi’s economic activities and public spaces have opened up in a phased manner.On Friday, Delhi recorded 1,330 Covid-19 cases, taking the total to 26,334. The death toll went up to 708. Of the 15,311 active Covid-19 cases as on Friday, 10,255 are in home isolation.PRIVATE HOSPITALS AND OTHERSIn another order issued earlier this week, the government directed all private hospitals with more than 50 beds to dedicate 20% of the total beds to Covid-19 patients. With this, the government hopes to add another 2,643 beds for Covid treatment at 42 private hospitals, another set of government documents showed.The order is applicable to 117 hospitals and nursing homes in the city built on land procured from the government at subsidised rates. But apart from the 42, the rest are yet to give estimates to the government, a senior official said.On Thursday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had said hospitals that fail to earmark 20% of their beds for Covid-19 treatment will have to offer up the entire hospital to combat the pandemic. The government has also allowed such hospitals to increase their total bed capacity by 25%.Currently, the city has 10 Covid-dedicated hospitals, which collectively provides around 4,000 beds and 130 ventilators. The hospitals are Max Super Speciality Hospital, Apollo Hospitsal, Sir Ganga Ram Kolmet Hospital, Sir Ganga Ram City Hospital, Mahadurga Charitable Trust Hospital, Batra Hospital, Fortis Shalimar Bagh, Venkateshwara Hospital, Moolchand Hospital and Saroj Super Speciality Hospital.Apart from these, the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium, Chhatrasal Stadium, Siri Fort Sports Complex, Saket Sports complex, more than 20 hotels and banquet halls have been identified by the revenue department as facilities that can be converted into Covid-19 hospitals or quarantine facilities, should the need arises, the senior official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-plans-to-ramp-up-city-s-covid-beds-over-three-weeks/story-QEF2XuOqFsKvkNFv4f88KO.html
06-06-2020||Delhi||Total active cases in Delhi breach 15,000 mark, govt comes out with patient care guidelines||Delhi on Friday recorded 1,330 fresh cases of Covid-19, taking the number of active cases or those still with the infection past the 15,000 mark. The total active cases on Friday were 15,311.As of Friday, a total of 26,334 people had contracted the infection, a health bulletin by Delhi government said.Of the 15,331 patients, at least 3,899 — or around 25% of those infected — with severe symptoms, like elevated respiratory rate and low oxygen saturation, have been admitted to Covid-19 hospitals. At least 1.5% of those infected needed to be admitted to the intensive care unit, data showed.There are 10,255 Covid-19 positive people who are under home quarantine in the city. This is almost 67% of all those currently living with the infection.On Friday, another 58 fatalities due to the virus were added to the cumulative total, taking the city’s death toll to 708. According to the bulletin, 25 of these deaths happened on June 3.Delhi fatality rate on Friday stood at almost 2.7%.To keep pace with the increasing number of cases in the city, the Delhi government is working on augmenting healthcare facilities in the city. The government said it is also trying to ensure quality of care through a set of Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the admission of Covid-19 patients.The SOPs state that a patient has to be brought into the hospital’s triage area within 15 minutes of reaching the health hub. The new rules say that a patient has to be provided a bed or sitting space in the area within 60 minutes, he/she must be given something to eat and a course of action for further admission or transfer has to be taken within 3 hours.In case the patient needs a higher level of care, the hospital has to ensure his/her transfer and if they have to be sent to a Covid Care Centre then the hospital has to facilitate the transfer in communication with the nodal officer of such centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/total-active-cases-in-delhi-breach-15-000-mark-govt-comes-out-with-patient-care-guidelines/story-Gqny2OdbiB1iZQmrOWguxL.html
06-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s infrastructure projects hit hard by labour migration||Slated for completion in March this year, the flyover projects in Shastri Park and Seelampur would have put an end to the traffic woes of lakhs of people living in the trans-Yamuna area.But the wait for “seamless connectivity” between northeast and east Delhi—the two projects, worth ₹303 crore in total, are part of the Delhi government’s plan to decongest east Delhi—has now become longer.While traffic is back on GT Road, on which the two projects are planned, work on the sites is moving at a snail’s pace. According to the Delhi government’s Public Works Department (PWD) officials, the number of workers at both the sites has dropped from 300 to just 100-120 since the lockdown was announced in March to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Residents of northeast Delhi, who were eagerly awaiting the inauguration of these flyovers, are disappointed. Aftab Ahmad, a resident of Jafrabad, said, “The stretch is riddled with bottlenecks and traffic jams are routine. The projects have constantly been getting delayed for one reason or another—be it riots or lockdown,” Ahmad said.All major infrastructure projects in Delhi are in the same boat. Reverse migration and the uncertainty over the migrants’ return has adversely impacted the timeline of infrastructure projects, such as India Trade Promotion Organisation’s (ITPO) Pragati Maidan redevelopment project, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s Phase-4 project, the Barapullah Phase-3 project, etc.Despite the Delhi government allowing construction work to resume in May, the agencies involved are struggling to get labour. With just 10-15% work remaining at the two flyovers, PWD officials said they were trying to arrange additional labourers and hoped to complete the work by July this year, the new deadline for the projects. “This project is a priority for the Delhi government. The pace is slow because of the shortage of labour,” a PWD official said, requesting anonymity.According to officials of the Delhi government, the exact number of migrants who have left the city is unknown as many walked and cycled back to their home states during the initial days of the lockdown. A total of 450,000 migrants had applied on the government’s portal to be sent back home. The Delhi government sent 310,000 of them back home to 16 states in 237 special trains. Of the remaining workers, some decided to stay back when lockdown norms were eased, and the government is making efforts to send the others back home via buses.According to various government agencies, most construction workers in Delhi belong to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Jharkhand. Government agencies involved in five major infrastructure projects in Delhi said that the strength of this workforce has dropped by 50-75%, resulting in delays.At the Pragati Maidan redevelopment site, the number of workers has dropped from 3,800 to 350-400 since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, LC Goyal, chairman and managing director, ITPO, said. “We are making all efforts to re-mobilise labour so that construction work can start while ensuring social distancing and other norms at the site. We are revising the timelines,” he said. The ₹2,700 crore project was slated for completion in March 2021.A major part of the ITPO redevelopment project is the ₹777 crore traffic regulation project, which is being carried out by the Delhi PWD. The construction of a 1.2-km-long tunnel between Purana Qila Road (near Pragati Maidan Mathura Road) and the Ring Road (near Pragati Power Station), and the construction of six underground U-turns on Mathura Road and Bhairon Marg are part of the project.Once the project is complete, motorists travelling from Noida, Ghaziabad and south and east Delhi will have signal-free access to India Gate and Mathura Road, and vice versa.The tunnel, PWD officials said, was to be completed by June this year. “Earlier, there were nearly 600 labourers engaged in construction work, but now there are only 320. It is certain that the June deadline will be extended by a few months as around 30% of the work is still pending,” one of the officials said, requesting anonymity.But this is not the first time that construction work has stalled for a considerable duration in the city. Work was affected in November last year when construction activity was banned because of a rise in the pollution levels.“We could work during the day in December, but the government lifted the ban on construction activity at night only in February this year. This adversely impacted the pace of construction work. There was a similar situation in 2018-19 when work had to be stopped during the peak pollution season,” Goyal said.The biggest challenge that construction firms and contractors are facing is getting labour back. Shapoorji Pallonji E&C, which is involved in several construction projects in the National Capital Region (including ITPO’s Pragati Maidan), said that before the lockdown on March 25, they employed 10,000 construction workers across the Delhi-NCR.“Depending on the volume of work, the number of workers at each project site ranged from 150 to nearly 4,000. Currently, we are left with only 15% to 20% of the original workforce strength,” a spokesperson of Shapoorji Pallonji E&C said.At all major infrastructure project sites, construction firms are making arrangements for labourers’ boarding and lodging. “Although organised players like us were taking care of these workers by providing them with wages, rations and medical facilities both before and during the lockdown, there was growing anxiety among the workers with news of the lockdown getting extended,” the spokesperson added.A labour contractor said, “People were getting restless and wanted to go back. A total of 150 people were working under me before the lockdown at the ITPO site, but just 10-15 of them stayed back. Once the special trains started operating, all the migrant labourers wanted to leave. It is difficult to arrange for labourers now.”The DMRC, which had started construction work on its Phase-4 in December last year after a delay of nearly three years, confirmed that the pace of work had slowed due to the reverse migration of the labour force.According to officials of DMRC, work had started at the Haiderpur Badli Mor Metro station (part of Janakpuri West-RK Ashram corridor). They had made arrangements there for the workers to stay. “Before the lockdown, DMRC employed about 3,500 workers. Presently, the number varies between 1,000 and 1,500. However, we are continuing work with the remaining workforce but the pace of work is suffering. The deadlines will have to be modified accordingly,” Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC, said.Government agencies have now asked contractors to make arrangements to mobilise labour. But a sub-contractor working with a government firm, requesting anonymity, said, “It is difficult to get labour. We are trying to source it from nearby areas. But due to the border restrictions, it is difficult to meet the demand.”PWD officials said that the contractors have started arranging some labour from nearby areas, but they are mostly unskilled people. At PWD’s Barapullah Phase-3 project, which connects Ring Road with the UP Link Road near Mayur Vihar Phase -1, a PWD official said, “Earlier nearly 500-600 labourers used to work at the site, depending upon the requirement. But currently, only 300 labourers are available. This has severely reduced the pace of the work,” the official said.With a large percentage of the migrant workforce gone from the Capital, it is difficult to say when it will return, Sachidanand Sinha, a professor at the Centre for the Study of Regional Development at Jawaharlal Nehru University, said. “They will return for sure as there is not much work available in their home states. Moreover, this is a lean period in agricultural activity. People will need money and will return to cities to earn their livelihood, but it is difficult to say how long it will take. If states like UP, Bihar and Rajasthan (from where most migrants are) provide them with more employment under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA), then it could delay their return to cities,” Sinha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/city-s-infrastructure-projects-hit-hard-by-labour-migration/story-Ekqdecpd2d0bnbe7eLdriI.html
06-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi family moves high court for hospital bed, man dies before hearing||The family of 80-year-old Motiram Goyal, who tested positive for Covid-19, had moved the Delhi High Court on Wednesday, seeking directions to the Delhi government to arrange a bed with a ventilator for him in a state-run hospital. However, by the time the matter came up for hearing on Friday, Goyal had died.The Delhi government’s counsel told the court that the day they received the plea, they had arranged a bed for Goyal. But when they called to inform him, they got to know that he had already died. Additional standing counsel Anjum Javed for the Delhi government told the court that the petition was filed on Wednesday. They received it on Thursday and when he called the counsel for the petitioner on Thursday to inform him that a bed had been arranged, he was told that the patient had expired on Wednesday. According to advocate RPS Bhatti, who represented the Goyals, the court said that matters with medical emergencies should be dealt with on the same day. However, the order is yet to be uploaded on the website of the Delhi High Court. According to Anil Goyal, the son of the deceased man, they admitted his father to Jain Hospital at Vikas Marg on May 25. Motiram Goyal was suffering from high blood pressure, nervousness and was also failing to recognise his family.However, after a week, his father tested positive for Covid-19, allegedly due to the negligence of the hospital, a charge denied by the hospital.“I admitted my father to the hospital on May 25 and a week later he was found positive, even though there were no symptoms. The hospital authorities kept my father beside a Covid-19 patient because of which my father was infected. Following this, they asked us to shift him to some other hospital,” Goyal alleged.Sangeeta Jain, the director of Jain Hospital, refuted all charges of negligence and said that they were not a designated Covid-19 hospital. She added that Goyal had come in with several co-morbidities and in a confused state, following which he was admitted to their hospital.“The patient had come in with several co-morbidities. He was being treated well. But when we conducted a Covid test, we found he was positive. Since we are not a designated Covid-19 hospital, we asked him to shift to another. Hence, their allegation that they have contracted the virus from the hospital is baseless. In fact, we took the best care of the patient when the family was struggling to get a bed,” Jain said.Goyal’s family alleged that the newly launched Delhi Corona app, which ostensibly displays the number of beds available for Covid-19 patients in government hospitals, was of not much use, as the hospitals denied them admission citing non-availability of beds.Anil Goyal, who works in a cycle repair shop, shared screenshots of the app with HT, which showed beds were available in certain hospitals. However, when the family called, these hospitals refused admission stating that they did not have beds available.“From May 31, since my father tested positive, my son and I called several government hospitals and even went to them seeking admission for him. However, all the hospitals denied having beds, even though the app showed beds available.“We also called several government helplines of both the Centre and the Delhi government and registered complaints on the non-availability of beds. However, no one gave us a solution as we struggled, even though various private hospitals could have admitted my father under the EWS category,” he said.Anguished, they moved the Delhi High Court on Wednesday, while, he alleged, his father languished in Jain Hospital with no one to take care of him and no permission to meet his family. Anil Goyal said that they also wrote about their problem on social media and emailed to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, but did not get a response.“My son sent an email to the CM and also posted a message on Twitter tagging him, but we did not get any response. When my father died on Wednesday, we could not even see him one last time as the hospital authorities had packed his body and even covered his face. When we went to the cremation ground and tried to open the body bag, the people at the crematorium said that they would not conduct his last rites if we did so,” Goyal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-family-moves-high-court-for-hospital-bed-man-dies-before-hearing/story-EaHO2ANsym9u0vRTTaxNiJ.html
06-06-2020||Delhi||Air pollution dipped by 79% during lockdown in Delhi, on rise again||Pollution levels in Delhi-NCR -- which had come down by around 79% during the initial phase of the lockdown, mainly owing to no industrial activity, reduced on-road traffic and a pause on construction activities -- is on an upswing again as the city gradually opens up, a study by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has found. Of the six mega cities where PM 2.5 levels were studied during this period, Delhi saw the steepest rise of four to eight times, as compared to two to six times in other cities, the analysis shows.CSE studied the PM 2.5 levels of six cities — Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru — during both the initial and last phases of the nationwide lockdown to check the spread of Covid-19. According to the findings, while the PM 2.5 levels in other cities dropped by 45-88% in the initial lockdown phase and witnessed a pollution spike of 2-6 times on opening up, Delhi saw both the steepest drop and sharpest spike .“In Delhi-NCR, one of the major factors that led to the drop in pollution was a 97% reduction in overall traffic and 91% reduction in trucks and commercial vehicles entering the capital during April, as compared to the pre-lockdown months of December-January,” the study found.It said, as compared to 84,399 heavy vehicles entering Delhi in January this year, only 7,942 plied in the city during April, when the lockdown was in full effect.PM 2.5 (ultrafine particles that can enter the lungs and blood stream) is the most prominent pollutant in Delhi-NCR as well as in other major cities across the country. Between March 25 and May 18, when the nationwide lockdown was implemented without any major relaxations, the pollution levels in the national capital reduced drastically and remained in the “satisfactory” category for most of the time. After May 18, however, as lockdown rules were eased, the pollution graph started climbing again. From May 18 to June 5, the air quality index of Delhi has remained in the ‘moderate’ category. On Friday, the AQI levels was recorded as 111 in the moderate category, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).The pollution levels were also kept in check because of the increased Western Disturbances that crossed Delhi during and after the lockdown period. Though not all Western Disturbances brought rain, the increased wind speeds helped blow away pollutants. Sunita Narain, director general, CSE, said the analysis clearly shows that the nation needed an intervention at such a massive scale — where movement across the country was completely restricted, and all industrial activities stopped functioning — to clean our air and lungs. “It tells us clearly what the key sources of air pollution are — emissions from vehicles and industry,” she said.The study states that Delhi has an approximately 12.1 million registered vehicles, of which 4.6 million are private vehicles. Of these, only a fraction plied during the lockdown period. Also, visits to workplaces reduced by 60%, while retail and recreation activities reduced by 84%. Besides, activities in residential areas increased by 29%. Cycling and walking increased from 14% to 43%.“The challenge lies in the fact that on opening up, we are likely to go back to the old habits. Today we are re-opening without any plan to keep the air clean. We need to set an agenda including prompt implementation of BS-VI for cleaner fuel, augmentation of public transport, create infrastructure and promote incentivised cycling and walking and introduction of cleaner battery-powered para-transit modes,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy and head of air pollution and clean transportation programme at CSE. Brijmohan Das, atmospheric sciences researcher at IIT-Delhi, said that restrictions on human activities such as vehicular movement and industrial activities contribute a major chunk in the city’s pollution levels . “This should be an eye opener for us.

06-06-2020||Delhi||Call on reopening malls, hotels, borders on Saturday, says Delhi govt||The Delhi government will on Saturday take a call on whether malls, places of worship, hotels and the borders should be opened or stay shut, and also decide if hospital beds should be limited for Delhi residents. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has called a high-level meeting on Saturday to discuss the remaining parameters of unlocking Delhi under the Centre’s phase-1 guidelines and preparedness for handling Covid-19 patients. Till Friday evening, the government had received more than 7.5 lakh responses from people regarding the opening of Delhi’s borders, which were shut for a week on Monday, and limiting city hospitals to residents of the Capital. “Earlier it was decided that the decision on the first phase of unlocking the city -- opening of malls, dine-in restaurants, places of worship and hotels -- would be taken on June 7 (Sunday). But now both decisions, including border sealing and hospital beds, will be taken on Saturday,” a senior government official said on condition of anonymity. On Friday, Delhi recorded 1,330 new Covid cases, taking the total to 26,334. Also, as many as 25 new deaths were recorded, taking the toll to 708. Out of the 15,311 active Covid cases as on Friday, 10,255 had mild or no symptoms. “The move to seek suggestions from the public by the Delhi government received an overwhelming response. Till 5 pm today, the Delhi government received around 7,00,000 WhatsApp messages, 5,000 emails, and 53,000 calls. More than 7.5 lakh people have sent their suggestions on the appeal of the CM,” a statement from Kejriwal’s office read. A government spokesperson said the present situation in Delhi will be reviewed keeping in mind public suggestions. “Experts and doctors will also be consulted on Saturday, other than top officials of the government,” the spokesperson said.On Monday, Kejriwal in a digital press briefing, had allowed barber shops and salons to operate. Kejriwal had also allowed markets to open on all days of the week . The order, however, remained silent on the opening of malls, dine-in restaurants, places of worship and so on. A senior health official said hotels may not be allowed to operate since they are being requisitioned to be developed as Covid care facilities. Kejriwal had also announced the sealing of the borders for a week starting Monday, with essential services remaining functional and government officers continuing to travel on their identity cards.On Thursday, Kejriwal, in an interview to TV news channel News18 India, said he was in favour of opening all borders but expressed concern over Covid beds getting filled within two days if patients from across the country keep coming for treatment in Delhi. “About 60-70% of patients in Delhi’s hospitals at any given point of time are from other states. We have so far got about 5-6 lakh suggestions and some of them are really interesting. Some people suggested Delhi government’s hospitals should be reserved for residents of Delhi while Central government hospitals should be opened to all. The specialised facilities such as transplantations should also be opened for everyone,” Kejriwal had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/call-on-reopening-malls-hotels-borders-on-saturday-says-delhi-govt/story-c2H4ZWFs1UW36rdxNcV3pN.html

These expenses have to be recovered from the consumers and this is done by having a two-part tariff. Thus, the recovery of these expenses from the tariff is also levied on two-part tariff basis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/25-fixed-electricity-charges-for-two-and-a-half-months-to-be-waived-in-ut/story-yZZtCw98d4awJ4LI6IRBAN.html

From May 28 onwards, the city has started reporting a sudden spike in the number of cases. Acknowledging the surge in cases, a senior official in the state government said, “Positive cases are rapidly increasing. This is because we are tracing people who have been missed due to poor reporting of data in the past. In this process, we are getting many new positive patients who are asymptomatic in nature. It has led to the surge in numbers,” said the official.On Friday, VS Kundu, CEO, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority(GMDA), also the monitoring in-charge for the Covid-19 in Gurugram, issued a statement, saying that criminal action will be initiated against any hospital that refuses treatment to a Covid-19 positive pregnant woman. Health official said that they are often getting cases where private hospitals are refusing to treat Covid-19 positive pregnant woman.On the other hand, MCG has closed its main office in Sector 34 till Monday after a positive case was reported. Officials said that all employees on the second floor, where the accounts branch is located, will be tested for the virus. They also said that other officials who suspect they are exhibiting symptoms can also volunteer to get themselves checked as a precautionary measure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/153-test-covid-19-positive-in-city-tally-crosses-1-500/story-zn9FcdV4XCiOru37mbNUML.html

Breaching the mark of 1,500 cases on Friday, Gurugram’s current test positivity rate is almost at 47%. In a bid to tackle the situation, the administration has decided to divide all crucial tasks related to Covid-19 — collecting lab reports, contact tracing, timely hospitalisation/home isolation — among at least 14 officials of different government departments instead of giving all responsibilities to only the health department. Out of the total 3,597 cases in Haryana, 1,563 cases are from Gurgram.Officials from Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran, Gurugram district administration, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), and Haryana Roadways have been roped in to streamline data collection and take up other efforts. From the declaration of positive patients by a lab to their contact tracing, all such duties will be shared by different government agencies. It will help us in managing the data and strengthening the infrastructure,” said Ashok Sangwan, divisional commissioner.Under the plan, the MCG will liaison with all private labs for timely updates of test reports. “The test reports will be segregated from our end zone-wise,” said Dr Ashish Singla, medical officer, MCG. The administration has divided the district into seven zones to handle cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in different containment zones.The list of positive patients will then be shared with urban Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and Community Health Centres (CHCs), who will work in coordination with the HSVP for contact tracing.A 25-member control room has been set up by the HSVP for contact tracing. Jitender Yadav, administrator, HSVP and Bharat Bhushan Gogia, estate Officer, HSVP are the designated in-charges, will rope in their employees for the task. The list prepared by the HSVP will be shared with additional deputy commissioner Prashant Panwar’s team which will then monitor the health of contacts through telephonic calls.“We have identified 40 people who will contact people with links to a positive patient,” said Panwar. “Some of them will operate from Vikas Sadan and a few from remote locations. They will inquire about the health condition of the contacts. More than 1,000 calls will be made in a day. In case, if a team member finds a persons has some health issues, we will be immediately coordinate with the ambulance and hospitalisation team,” he said.Sonal Goel, CEO, Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited (GMCBL), has been designated as the supervisor for tertiary care of Covid-19 patients in private and government hospitals. Her team has prepared a reporting format using which precise data on the number of beds available for symptomatic patient in private hospitals will be collected.“There been a lack of transparency in the past, therefore, we will be circulating a format to 23 private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients and those who have designated beds for patients, and data will be collected from them daily,” said Goel. “Once the data is final, it will be available in the public domain for Covid-19 patients to choose hospitals as per their criteria and availability of beds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-ropes-in-senior-officials-of-different-government-agencies-to-tackle-covid-19-spread-in-gurugram/story-ydnDOYSj52R9IE1qfje8kL.html

She said that most councillors wanted two agendas to be discussed in the upcoming meeting.“I have received the agenda list from 23 of the 35 councillors. The remaining councillors are expected share their agenda by Saturday. While recognising the problem related to Covid-19, we feel it is now time to start shifting our focus towards restarting development projects as well,” said Azad.Azad said that two agendas — first, to increase the standard for selecting contractors for sanitation works, and second, appointing three officials to coordinate with councillors of each ward with development work, horticulture, and sanitation — are likely to be put forward for discussion on Monday.“We have been receiving a lot of complaints from residents about unsatisfactory work being carried out by contractors across all the four zones of MCG. We want to increase the parameters and qualifications before finalising contractors for sanitation works next time onward to ensure that high standards are maintained,” said Azad.The tenure of MCG contractors for sanitation was due to end in April. Due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the Haryana government across the state decided to extend tenures of all sanitation contractors by another year.The last House meeting took place at John Hall in Civil Lines on February 3.

06-06-2020||Noida||Lockdown haul: Noida police collect ₹5.92 lakh in fines, penalise 57,961 vehicles||The Gautam Budh Nagar police has penalised 57,961 vehicles under the Motor Vehicle (MV) Act and collected over ₹5.92 lakh in fines from them for various violations of the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Police commissioner Alok Singh said over 7,000 people in the district were arrested for breach of peace. “Since the lockdown was announced on March 25, we have seized 1,845 vehicles that were plying in the district without passes or valid reasons. As many as 1,994 cases against 8,416 people were registered under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, which deals with disobedience to an order duly promulgated by a public servant,” he said.Singh further said during different phases of the lockdown -- the country is currently in the fifth phase -- the police have checked 1,92,864 vehicles. “Of them, fines against 57,961 vehicles were issued, while 1,845 others were seized. Till Thursday evening, the police have collected ₹5,92,500 in fines imposed on these vehicles,” he said.The police chief also said so far, they have filed five cases of misuse of social media and booked five persons in connection with spreading fake news. “Keeping a close watch on the black marketeers, we have lodged as many as seven cases under the Essential Commodities Act against nine shopkeepers resorting to black marketing during the lockdown. Five of them have already been arrested,” he said. Talking about the Noida-based security and fire safety solutions company, Ceasefire, which became a super spreader of Covid-19 till the third week of April, Singh said till then, of the total 162 employees of that company, 57 ha contracted the virus. “By the time, the police started containing the spread, the employees had spread the virus to persons in Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan, besides districts in Uttar Pradesh such as Meerut, Bulandshahr and Ghaziabad. But, we successfully traced all direct and indirect contacts of these employees,” he said.Singh said his force has started creating a database of everyone who lives or works in the district to trace Covid-19 cases systematically. “We are maintaining the chain of sources as even a minor break in this chain could worsen the situation,” he said.Giving details about Tablighi Jamaat members, whose congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin in mid-March was identified as another super spreader, the police chief said altogether eight cases had been lodged against 74 persons, under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the IPC and Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act. “Of the 74 members and their contacts, only three tested positive for Covid-19,” he said.The police chief said aerial checking is also being done with drones in containment zones. “We have issued fines in 158 cases of violations of lockdown norms, based on reports given by these drones. The drones have also found 1,119 persons not wearing masks and they, too, have been fined,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/lockdown-haul-noida-police-collect-5-92-lakh-in-fines-penalise-57-961-vehicles/story-CALALO0NH90LmbCyX9Ie6I.html
06-06-2020||Noida||As businesses suffer, shop owners want odd-even system to be scrapped||As businesses in Noida fail to attract enough footfall despite markets being open, owners now want work to resume for all six days of the week, instead of alternate days as per the present odd-even system. The previous phase of the lockdown had allowed markets to open while maintaining norms of social distancing and necessary precautions. In order to avoid overcrowding, business owners and officials alike came up with the odd-even system while keeping aside Sunday as a fixed off day for sanitisation purposes. Earlier this week, business owners, however, changed the off day to a weekday as they did not want to loose out on the Sunday rush of buyers.“We saw some significant footfall when the markets first opened as people stepped out to purchase things they wanted during the lockdown, such as appliances or clothes. However, the rush soon ended after the first couple of days. People are no loner stepping into the markets as before, because of which businesses are unable to pick up pace,” said Anita, a stationery shop owner in Savitri market.Business owners feel that the odd-even system is cutting into the revenue and, as such, they want authorities to reconsider the system. “One set of people never gets a chance to open their shops on Sundays. This is unfair. If the odd-even system is supposed to continue for the long run, we need to come up with ways to ensure that everyone gets an equal opportunity to do business. Either Sundays need to be alternated for the business owners or we need to come up with a uniform system for everyone,” said Amit Jain, who owns a wristwatch showroom in Sector 18.Taking note of the predicament of the shop owners, the Sector 18 market association has requested the administration to allow for a six-day working week.“In Lucknow, markets with dividers in between can open shops for six days. In Sector 18, no two showrooms are exactly opposite of each other. There is enough space to maintain social distancing and we can open up for six days without flouting any social distancing norms. This way, owners will not face any losses. Therefore, we have requested the administration to consider the situation,” said Sushil Kumar Jain, president, Sector 18 market association.The district administration is yet to issue any specific guidelines for malls, which are supposed to open from June 8.“A decision can be taken only after reviewing the situation and guidelines will be issued accordingly. There are various methods that were being considered for the gradual opening up of businesses and the odd-even system was the most suitable for urban areas,” said district labour commissioner, PK Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/as-businesses-suffer-shop-owners-want-odd-even-system-to-be-scrapped/story-XTAYKo90EPqXhEwY1K9CyH.html
06-06-2020||Pune||Cost of Covid-19 testing to reduce in Pune, says medical education minister||After the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) removed the price cap on Covid-19 testing, the state government is now negotiating with private laboratories who have priced each test at Rs 4,500 which was the initial cap fixed by the state government. Maharashtra medical education minister Amit Deshmukh said that while the prices have come down to half in Mumbai the state government would try to bring down the prices in Pune as well. While addressing the media on Friday, Deshmukh said, “We have been able to negotiate with labs in Mumbai and have convinced them to bring down the price by half to around 2,500 to 2,000 in Mumbai. We would try to do the same for Pune. As the number of people seeking these tests has gone up, we believe it would also be affordable for labs to bring down the price furthermore.”Deshmukh also said that there has been a slight drop in the number of people testing positive in proportion to the tests, which are being conducted as per the ICMR guidelines, however, multiple efforts are being made to further bring down the number of tests and also the mortality rate in the state which is also one of the worst affected states in the country.“The fight against Covid19 is not inside but outside the hospitals. I salute and congratulate all health workers who are at the forefront of this war and sadly we have lost a few health workers in this war and the state government stand by them and their family,” he said.Deshmukh also said that in a post-Covid-19 situation, the state government mulls the idea of starting a rating system for government hospitals wherein the lack of infrastructure in health facilities could be highlighted.“The government is also prioritising filling in all the vacant posts of nurses and doctors in government colleges and hospitals,” he said.According to Deshmukh, Maharashtra only had four viral research and diagnostics laboratories (VRDL’s), but now has about 80 of them which is the highest in the country. These VRDL’s are located across the state’s nooks and corners.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cost-of-covid-19-testing-to-reduce-in-pune-says-medical-education-minister/story-5c4W0ZCaU7ddyJmfN36W0J.html

On contact tracing the family, 12 of the 26-member family tested positive for the virus, including the senior citizen. Doctors caution that the number of negatives was possible because of test timing, which is usually the next day. The highest chances of infection is on the fourth or fifth day.The patient who was admitted at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital (DMH) showed initial signs of sore throat and sneezing. The patient got himself tested and result showed positive. Soon, the family was contact traced and only 11 tested positive. Those who tested negative were mostly young and did not report any comorbidity.When the patient’s condition was deteriorating, the family also opted for Ayurvedic treatment after consulting the treating doctor. The Ayurvedic treatment was done under Dr Yogesh Bendale of Rasayu Ayurved clinic. Dr Bendale said, “The real strength of Ayurveda lies in its multi-system biology approach and patient-centric approach. It acts in sync with body’s own defence mechanism and thus can be of a great use in critical cases as well. He believes that body’s immune system plays a critical role in management of Covid-19 infection. Currently, in absence of any potential and effective antivirus therapy, the main focus of treatment is towards providing symptomatic management and supportive therapies, while the body fights with the virus. Thus, when we are so much dependent on body’s own defence mechanism, it becomes pertinent to boost the endogenous mechanism and accelerate recovery.”After undergoing Ayurvedic treatment along with conventional medicine, the 60-year-old, who was admitted on May 12, was discharged on May 24.Dr Parikshit Prayag, Covid-19 specialist at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital said, “The time of testing is very crucial as most of the close contacts of a Covid-19 positive patient are tested the very next day, whereas the highest chances of infection is on the fourth or fifth day. It is very less likely that the virus may show symptoms on the very next day. Also, as the pandemic grows within the community, it becomes difficult to keep track of the source of the infection and so cluster handling becomes difficult. The current guidelines do not state for repeat testing of asymptomatic close contacts, but only symptomatic ones.”He said that while the chances of any person being infected remains the same irrespective of age or comorbidity condition. However, the way the virus behaves in body differs. Dr Prasad Rajhans, intensivist at DMH and also a part of the Pune’s task force for Covid-19 said, “There could be multiple reasons why someone who despite coming in contact with a positive person would test negative. It depends on multiple factors like immunity of the individual. asymptomatic carriers, timing of the swab collection and test and also the sensitivity of test.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/14-of-26-member-family-test-negative-in-pune-after-index-case-contracts-covid-19-docs-point-to-time-of-contact-testing/story-nDY2mn3QaqjHjTtVa9RYaO.html

Now pay Rs 200 fine in PCMC||Coming down heavily on those who fail to comply with Covid-19 (coronavirus) guidelines, the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has decided to impose a penalty of Rs 200 for those who don’t wear a mask or face cover in public.The fine for not wearing a mask in PCMC is less as compared to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), where the penalty is Rs 500. “This decision was taken by the standing committee members as most people are not receiving salaries on time due to the Covid-19 crisis and are already under financial strain. Hence, the fine was kept to Rs 200,” said Santosh Londhe, standing committee chairman.“Though the civic body has not been collecting fines so far, however, with the issued order, it is a must to wear masks in public. The PCMC will follow this rule strictly,” added Londhe.States like Punjab, Haryana, Assam has also imposed ban of Rs 500 for not wearing mask in public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/in-public-without-a-mask-now-pay-rs-200-fine-in-pcmc/story-1UNcPgI5zLkWFetni6nf3N.html

There are a total of 152 big and small rainwater nullahs, in Pimpri-Chinchwad.The pre-monsoon nullah cleaning work which generally starts from January, slowed down due to the Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic this year. “In a few more days, all the nullahs will be cleaned. This time we have used more machines for the cleaning work. It helped us to complete work despite less manpower,” said Dr Anil Roy, medical officer of health, PCMC.Most of the nullahs were cleaned by JCB’s and poclain machines, he added.“Wherever there were small nullahs, manpower was used as machines cannot be handy in those places, but we have used less manpower this year as compared to the previous year,” said Roy.“Many of the big nullahs were not safe for workers as there were many bushes inside so machines were very helpful. At many places work also got delayed as poclain machines were not available as we have hired it from the construction department,” added Roy.During the PCMC general meeting on Thursday, Shravan Hardikar, municipal commissioner, had informed that the nullahs where more water logging takes place were cleaned earlier this year.Rainwater nullahs in PCMCA zone (Nigdi Pradhikaran): 25B zone (Chinchwad): 13C zone (Pimpri): 33D zone (Rahatni):12E zone (Bhosari): 21F zone (Nigdi) :15G zone: (Thergaon) 9H zone: (Kasarwadi) 24Total: 152||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cleaning-of-nullahs-95-per-cent-complete-claims-pcmc/story-tQf7sBS411zDOSo65HVyWM.html

06-06-2020||Pune||BJP state president rejects Bajaj’s criticism of national lockdown||Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) state president Chandrakant Patil on Friday rejected the criticism against the national lockdown measures by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government and said the criticism had no merit and everyone in a democracy was free to express an opinion.Patil was briefing reporters on the achievements of the Modi government’s completion of its first year in the second term.Patil was asked by reporters whether he sensed disappointment in Indian industry with the Modi government’s measures, as reflected in the recent comments made by Rajiv Bajaj, managing director of Bajaj Auto, on the economic fallout of Covid-19. Bajaj, in his social media interaction with senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, had said that the national lockdown had managed to flatten the GDP curve and not the Covid-19 curve.Reacting to this criticism, Patil said, “The Prime Minister took the lockdown decision at the right time which helped us face the situation much better than other countries. India’s population is equal to that of the most-affected 14 countries. If we compare the number of Covid-19 positive cases and deaths in these countries, India has been in a better position. Significantly, the lockdown helped us ramp up our medical facilities.”Acknowledging the adverse impact of Covid-19 on the economy, he said, the central government took various steps to boost economic activities and the PM had announced a Rs 20 lakh crore package amounting to 10 per cent of the total GDP.“Everyone in a democracy is free to express an opinion,” he said while dismissing the criticism of the government.The BJP state president also questioned the credibility of the recent IANS C-Voter survey which had placed the popularity of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray at the fifth position among chief ministers, far ahead of BJP chief ministers. “We first need to check who conducted the survey. All BJP chief ministers are top rankers and are performing well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-state-president-rejects-bajaj-s-criticism-of-national-lockdown/story-7Zg5RiUq0LwdfkEYtRbsGJ.html

The decision was taken during a specially convened meeting by the board administration where the general body passed a resolution to the effect. The lockdown will be implemented on a staggered basis in the non-containment zones. Seven containment zones will be under lockdown till June 30. These are, Bhimpura, Modikhana, Bacchu Adda, Ghorpadi, New Modikhana, Gawli adda and Shivaji market.According to the proposed staggered system, establishments to the left side of the road will be open on one day, and those on the right will open the next day.The PCB elected board members said that lifting restrictions in the area where there were no Covid-19 patients was essential to kick-start the economy and revive the losses.PCB chief executive officer Amit Kumar said that the board took the decision in the larger interests of the cantonment residents and also took the losses of the business community into consideration. “The lockdown will be lifted in a staggered way and we are working out an odd-even system to implement the unlocking of the area. However, strictures will remain in place for the containment zones,” he said.Kiran Mantri, PCB elected member said “We had requested the administration to open up the area as financial losses are affecting citizens. However, the necessary precautions like social distancing and restrictions will be maintained until the situation returns to normalcy,” she said.Similarly, elected member Vinod Mathurwala reiterated that lockdown had created a financial emergency in the area and residents were losing livelihoods. “We are putting in place a system where all the precautionary and guidelines of the state government will be followed,” he said.Meanwhile, Kumar has given orders to increase screening of patients in the area so that the rapid spread can be curbed. “We have got nearly Rs 2 crore from the administration to carry out the anti-Covid-19 measures in the cantonment area,” he said.Kumar added that an intensive care unit (ICU) has been set up at the Pune Cantonment hospital with the help of the funds. The Cantonment Board has successfully treated 240 patients so far despite challenges like financial difficulties.So far, three people in the PCB area have died after testing positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cantonment-to-exit-lockdown-on-june-8-containment-zones-to-stay-locked-down-till-june-30/story-yJH4qakjTY0qoUtFSBZanN.html

As per records, 27% of the total cases are that of community transmission.Fourteen cases of community transmission surfaced on Friday alone.‘PEOPLE FLOUTING SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDELINES’Social worker Indu Arora says, “A two month lockdown was imposed to contain the spread of the disease. However, now that relaxations have been announced people are not following precautions.”“People are not wearing face masks and tossing social distancing norms to the wind, leading to greater community spread. The administration should step up surveillance and increase restrictions,” Arora says.Maninder Kaur, a local, said, “Now, almost every locality of the city has a Covid-19 case. Despite the community spread, people are still not serious about social distancing. They can be seen crowding around shops.”CASES DETECTED AT FLU CORNERSCivil surgeon Dr Jugal Kishore said, “The patients who had contracted the infection through community transmission were tested at flu corners after they exhibited influenza-like symptoms. Their close contacts also tested positive.”“The health department and the district administration are trying to trace patients’ source of the infection. We are testing around 500 samples daily and since more people are being tested, asymptomatic cases are also being diagnosed,” Kishore said.“The number of cases is also increasing because relaxations have been allowed and people are not following social distancing norms. The situation is under control and we are working on stepping-up surveillance,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/86-locally-transmitted-covid-19-cases-reported-in-amritsar-in-16-days/story-AeiYV45WXzuTpVALI9I69L.html

A total 140 students can appear for the exam in one slot while strictly following the medical protocol in view of the coronavirus outbreak,” Kohli said.The vice-chancellor said a dry run of the novel initiative was tested successfully earlier this year. The practice to help students manage exam-related stress will be a regular feature.CUP sources said the exam system will also benefit students in a situation when dates of UGC entrance tests and other exams clash with the university’s academic schedules.Faculty members say as it is students are under stress due to the prolonged lockdown caused by the pandemic, so the university’s initiative is a positive reform.“If a student wishes, the CUP will allow her or him to take more than one or even all four exams on a single day. To handle the possibility of repetition of question papers, the university has developed an automated paper setter,” the V-C said.“An in-house exam system will take care of generating separate question papers of the same subject taken on different days,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-covid-times-central-university-of-punjab-bathinda-gives-students-option-to-choose-exam-dates/story-MMyqFPPiIouExJgmWX71pK.html

Sultan told me that I am a charming lady and I should not be roaming in the mandis for farmers. I tried to control my anger but his words pinched me so I thrashed him. He sought unconditional apology from me. Now, I have filed a complaint against Sultan Singh,” Phogat said.Hisar deputy commissioner (law and order) Joginder Sharma said they have received complaints from both BJP leader Sonali Phogat and mandi secretary Sultan Singh. “We are verifying the facts. Strict action will be taken. Sonali Phogat has alleged that the official made derogatory remarks against her and tried to assault her,” the DSP said.In his complaint to the police, Sultan Singh said Phogat had visited his Hisar office and asked him to be present at the Balsamand Mandi. “On reaching there, she asked me when procurement for gram will be started. I told her Hafed officials are not ready to initiate procurement due to lack of arrangements at the mandi. A shed will be needed there for procurement to begin. After talking for 15 minutes, she started abusing me for not starting the procurement process. She even accused me of not helping her during the assembly election. When I told her that I belong to Narwana and have no connection with Adampur, she started thrashing me,” he claimed. Phogat had contested the 2019 Haryana assembly elections from Adampur and lost to Congress’s Kuldeep Bishnoi.BJP state chief Subhash Barala condemned the attack on the market committee official. He said,“ We are waiting for a probe and only after that we can talk about Sonali Phogat.”Congress spokesman and former Kaithal MLA Randeep Singh Surjewala tweeted, “These acts (have been) done by a BJP leader. Is it a crime to do a government job? Will (chief minister Manohar Lal) Khattar take action against Phogat?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tiktok-star-turned-bjp-leader-sonali-phogat-thrashes-official-with-slipper-in-haryana-s-hisar/story-YsDUDctNnsaGEJqabW9dMO.html

06-06-2020||World||Donald Trump’s week to be remembered as his undoing or his revival||Donald Trump endured one of the grimmest weeks of his presidency, as days of protests in U.S. cities emerged as the biggest test yet of his ability to lead in a crisis and put new strains on his argument for a second term.Yet, for Trump it was also a week that ended on a high note. An unexpected surge in May hiring, despite the coronavirus pandemic, and an easing of tensions on American streets allowed him to claim Friday, in an extemporaneous Rose Garden speech, that “it’s the greatest comeback in American history.”That optimism underscored why the first week of June will likely be remembered as an inflection point in Trump’s presidency one way or another, seared into the minds and votes of an ailing American population. In five days, Trump either solidified perceptions that he’s an authoritarian leader with little capacity to unify a broken nation -- or re-established himself as an able shepherd of the U.S. economy, regardless of how voters otherwise feel about him.For many voters, one good jobs report can’t erase the first half of a year that saw Trump’s approval rating plunge to nearly its lowest point ever after his widely panned handling of the coronavirus outbreak. His hostile attitude toward nationwide protests over police brutality has alienated many Americans, and even some Republicans and military leaders.Mattis to MurkowskiTrump’s former defense secretary, James Mattis, issued a scathing criticism of the president on Wednesday that was subsequently endorsed by Trump’s former chief of staff and another retired general, John Kelly, and by Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski.In the last month, the political battlefield has dramatically shifted under Trump’s feet, as polling showed his presumptive re-election opponent Joe Biden taking leads or coming within striking distance in states the president’s team didn’t expect to be competitive.The former vice president holds an eight-point lead in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls, and is leading by three points or more in the three Rust Belt states that gave Trump the White House -- Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan -- and by smaller margins in Florida, Arizona, Ohio and North Carolina.Bad to WorseOne person familiar with the Trump campaign’s thinking said things had gone from bad to worse with the protests over George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody, and described alarm that the president’s previously impenetrable base of support appeared to be eroding.The person, who asked not to be identified discussing non-public information, described internal polling that shows increasing disapproval of the president and key states like Arizona slipping from Trump’s reach in the election.And while Friday’s jobs report shocked economists by showing a 2.5 million gain in employment, in contrast with forecasts of 7.5 million more lost jobs, there were warning signs in the data.Unemployment for African Americans, a demographic Trump has loudly courted, ticked up to 16.8%. And the Labor Department warned that the data contained an important inaccuracy. Many people surveyed who were on furloughs incorrectly reported their job status, artificially improving the unemployment rate.Biden meanwhile tried to seize on Trump’s difficulties. He delivered a well received speech on race relations in Philadelphia on Tuesday and brought in $4 million from just 25 wealthy donors in a virtual fundraiser on Thursday. He criticized Trump on Friday for “basically hanging a ‘mission accomplished’ banner when there is so much work to be done” during the president’s remarks on the jobs report.200 TweetsDespite a full schedule on Friday that saw him travel to Maine after his remarks on the economy, Trump issued 200 tweets, an all-time record for a single day, according to factba.se, a site that compiles his public remarks.The posts included items about the jobs report and about favorite targets including the Russian investigation, Biden and former President Barack Obama, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, whom he termed “grossly incompetent,” and former FBI attorney Lisa Page. Trump retweeted GOP lawmakers critizing Democrats over this week’s massive protests, slammed Twitter for taking down a campaign video over a copyright dispute, and promoted at least two books.Trump’s troubles began on Monday morning when he told the nation’s governors in a conference call that “most of you are weak” and warned they’d look like “jerks” if they didn’t “dominate” people protesting Floyd’s death.Recordings of the call were promptly leaked to news organizations.Whisked to BunkerThat evening, after criticism that he hadn’t addressed the nation on the unrest and reports the Secret Service had whisked him to a bunker to protect him from demonstrations in Washington, Trump decided to make impromptu remarks to reporters.As he threatened in the Rose Garden to use “thousands and thousands” of troops and law enforcement officers to quash violence and looting, reporters could hear authorities using munitions to clear peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House.Trump then gathered a coterie of all-white staff and walked across the emptied park to St. John’s Episcopal Church, which had been damaged by arson the night before, where he posed for photos holding up a Bible in one hand.“Pretty great,” he told reporters.The moment would define his week. Episcopal and Catholic leaders, former top military brass and even some Republicans condemned the violent dispersal of protesters before his walk to the church, and pictures of demonstrators fleeing police bearing plastic shields amid clouds of riot-control agents would become the indelible image from the event, instead of Trump’s photo op at the church.A night of bedlam in the streets of Washington, with low-flying military helicopters used to disperse protesters and drones hovering in the skies, deepened anxiety and outrage. By Tuesday afternoon, the government had begun transporting federal prison guards from out of state to reinforce the Secret Service and defend an expanding perimeter around the White House from protesters.Two Republican senators -- Tim Scott of South Carolina and Ben Sasse of Nebraska -- said they did not support the tactics used by federal authorities to disperse the Lafayette Square protesters. A presidential trip to the Catholic shrine to Saint John Paul II -- ostensibly to promote a religious freedom executive order -- only brought more embarrassment for the White House.The Catholic archbishop of Washington said it was “reprehensible” for the shrine to host the president after the Lafayette Square incident, while demonstrators with raised middle fingers and protest signs lined the motorcade route through the city.Pentagon CriticismThe political headwinds intensified for Trump on Wednesday, when Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters at the Pentagon he did not believe active-duty military troops should be used to address domestic turmoil. The remarks prompted consternation within the White House, and Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany offered only that “as of right now, Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper” when asked if Trump retained confidence in his Pentagon chief.That afternoon came a broadside: Mattis, who had largely remained quiet since resigning from the administration in December 2018 in protest of Trump’s decision to withdraw from Syria, released a statement condemning Trump’s “bizarre photo op” at the church and the military leadership that enabled it.“Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people -- does not even pretend to try,” Mattis said.Trump responded on Twitter, blasting his former Pentagon chief as “the world’s most overrated General” and saying he was happy to have fired him.On Friday, Kelly piled on. The former chief of staff sided with Mattis in a virtual event with Anthony Scaramucci, the financier who briefly served as Trump’s communications director but has since turned on him.“We need to look harder at who we elect,” said Kelly, who left the White House in January 2019. “We should look at people that are running for office and put them through the filter: What is their character like? What are their ethics?”In Maine on Friday, after touring a plant making swabs for coronavirus tests, Trump had a reply: he’s bringing back jobs. He noted that the 2.5 million jobs added in May was the most ever, overlooking that the 20.5 million lost in April was also a record.“The only thing that can screw it up,” he said, “is if you get the wrong president.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-week-to-be-remembered-as-his-undoing-or-his-revival/story-8pl48BUMnpqIXX8iGIQoeL.html

Banksy, whose identity remains unknown but has gained world-wide acclaim for his work appearing on public buildings, commented on the ‘Black Lives Matter’ movement in a social media post accompanied by artwork featuring a burning US flag.He wrote: “At first I thought I should just shut up and listen to black people about this issue. ‘But why would I do that? It’s not their problem, it’s mine.’ People of colour are being failed by the system. The white system”.Also read | ‘A great day for George Floyd,’ says Trump as he hails strong jobs report for US“Like a broken pipe flooding the apartment of the people living downstairs. The faulty system is making their life a misery, but it’s not their job to fix it. They can’t - no-one will let them in the apartment upstairs.”In Parliament Square in London and elsewhere, tens of thousands of people ignored official advice to avoid mass gatherings and came together to protest against the killing, carrying placards and ‘taking the knee’; not everyone wore face-masks.Patel said: “Of course, I completely understand people’s desire to express their views and to have that right to protest. But the fact of the matter is we are in a health pandemic across the United Kingdom and coronavirus is a deadly virus”. A post shared by Banksy (@banksy) on Jun 6, 2020 at 3:30am PDT“I’d say to those that want to protest: please don’t. The regulations are very clear in terms of gatherings and mass gatherings in particular. We must put public health first at this particular time”, she added.Cressida Dick, Scotland Yard commissioner, told police officers not to ‘take the knee’ as an act of solidarity, and advised people to protest without gathering in large groups because of the pandemic.She said: “We encourage our officers to talk to people, to engage in a positive manner with people. We won’t be kneeling during protests. However heartfelt something like that might be, I don’t think it is likely to be safe”.“We are fighting a deadly virus, it can get spread in gatherings,” she added.Also read | George Floyd’s death sparks new generation of activists in US||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-banksy-joins-tens-of-thousands-in-uk-protests/story-d6amDIHBf3xsscuAAd3KgK.html

All three politicians have denied the charges, and in two instances have filed a complaint with the country’s law enforcement agencies to investigate the matter further. This is the latest controversy involving Cynthia Ritchie, a combative social media influencer whom most outside of Pakistan would never heard of. Ritchie posted a Facebook live video on Friday in which she named former interior minister Rahman Malik, currently a member of the Senate or upper house of Parliament, of sexually assaulting her. She also accused former premier Yousaf Raza Gilani and former health minister Makhdoom Shahabuddin of harassing her. All three politicians belong to the opposition Pakistan People’s Party (PPP). This Facebook video was the latest in a series of exchanges between Ritchie and the leadership of the PPP, which has been incensed by the barrage of accusations flung their way by the American.Also Watch | ‘They want riots...’: PoK activist on Pakistan bid to hold Gilgit Baltistan polls Ritchie started the current spat by accusing late prime minister Benazir Bhutto of having ordered the rape of those women she suspected were having relations with her husband, Asif Ali Zardari. As on many occasions in the past, Ritchie offered no evidence to substantiate her allegations that have been described by several commentators as bizarre.While Zardari did not react to the accusation, the PPP’s senior leadership responded by asking who Ritchie was, who had authorised her stay in Pakistan, and what her source of income was, given that she did not seem to be engaged in any work with remuneration.Details were leaked from both sides - the PPP accused Ritchie of being a troll funded by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency while Ritchie questioned the actions of PPP leaders. In one bizarre gaffe, Ritchie posted a picture of Murtaza Wahab, a provincial minister from the PPP, standing next to a scantily dressed woman and accused him of being immoral. Wahab clarified the woman in question was a wax model at Madame Tussauds in London.Ritchie has accused PPP leaders of links with Gulf-based businessmen and alleged they were involved in a number of scams – all without any evidence whatsoever. So far the Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf (PTI) government led by Prime Minister Imran Khan, which is perceived as being close to the army, has taken no action despite a number of complaints filed against Ritchie with the cybercrime wing of the Federal Investigation Agency.In her latest accusation, Ritchie said her “ordeal” took place at Rehman Malik’s official residence in the ministers’ enclave in Islamabad in 2011 around the time “when the Osama Bin Laden incident happened”.“I thought it was a meeting about my visa but I was given flowers [and] a drugged drink,” she claimed, adding she had “kept quiet” about the incident because “who in the [ruling government] would help me against the [accused minister]?”Cynthia said she also informed the US embassy in 2011 about the incident, adding that “owing to fluid and complex Pak-US relations, the response was less than adequate”.In a tweet, exiled political commentator Aisha Siddiqa said the Pakistani establishment may be wanting to put pressure on the PPP leadership ahead of moves to roll back the 18th amendment to the Constitution. This amendment was passed by the former PPP government and gives enhanced powers to the democratic civilian government and to the provinces. Many commentators and experts in Pakistan also believe Ritchie – who has never shied away from flaunting her connections to the military on social media and often takes up nationalistic causes in her social media posts – could be acting at the behest of the powerful security establishment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-based-us-blogger-cynthia-ritchie-accuses-three-ppp-leaders-of-rape-assault/story-W5aiCiqYOTsk9K7JFvSEaP.html
06-06-2020||World||Pak-based American blogger accuses three PPP leaders of rape and assault||A Pakistan-based American blogger has accused three senior leaders of the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) of raping and assaulting her in 2011.Cynthia D Ritchie made the allegation through a video clip posted on her Facebook page on Friday and soon it went viral on social media.“In 2011, I was raped by the former interior minister Rehman Malik. That’s right, I’ll say it again. I was raped by the then interior minister Rehman Malik,” she claimed.She also said that former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and former health minister Makhdoom Shahabuddin “physically manhandled” her while Gilani was staying at the “President’s House” in Islamabad.Ritchie’s allegations have escalated the already bitter row between her and the party after she posted a comment on a tweet on May 28 against slain PPP leader and former prime minister Benzair Bhutto, which was termed as derogatory by the party leaders who filed a complaint against her at the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).Her comments came on a tweet discussing the violent confrontation between model Uzma Khan and a woman, who accused the former of having a relationship with her husband of 13 years and used this allegation to justify her violent treatment of the model.“This echoes stories of what BB used to do when her husband cheated. She’d have the guards rape the women. Why do women condone this rape culture? Why aren’t the men ever held accountable? Where is the justice system?” Ritchie wrote the comment on the tweet.According to media reports, PPP, on the same day, filed a complaint with the FIA against Ritchie for “hateful comments and slander” against Bhutto.In another post, Ritchie said that the rape assault against her took place at Malik’s house in the Ministers’ Enclave around the time of the raid in which Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan in 2011.“I thought it (was) a meeting about my visa but I was given flowers/a drugged drink,” she wrote.He also said that she kept mum as no one in the then PPP government helped her.PPP was in power from 2008 until 2013 and Gilani was the prime minister until he was removed by the Supreme Court in June 2012 for disobeying court orders.Ritchie also said she had informed about the incident to “someone” at the US Embassy in Pakistan in 2011, “but due to ‘fluid’ situation and ‘complex’ relations between US and Pakistan, [the] response was less than adequate”.Referring to her ongoing battle with the PPP, she said it was not really about that tweet but about the individuals who know she had a lot of dirt on a lot of people in Pakistan. “It is primarily those who use and abuse others, particularly women and the vulnerable population. And I am one of them,” Ritchie was quoted as saying by Dawn newspaper.However, Gilani has denied the charges and said that he is even considering responding to such allegations, “humiliation and disgrace”.While talking to ARY News, he was asked what Richie was doing at the Presidency when she was allegedly manhandled, and why she had been staying in Pakistan.Gilani alleged that she had come to Pakistan as part of a campaign to malign politicians.“Who has given them the right to malign politicians?” he asked.He said Ritchie was maligning him because his two sons had filed a defamation case against her for her allegedly defamatory tweet against Bhutto.However, the two former ministers have not so far responded to the allegations.

06-06-2020||World||Singapore opposition leader Pritam Singh calls for review of Covid-19 response||Singapore’s largest opposition party called for a thorough review of the government’s coronavirus response, citing public confusion over unclear communication and actions.“There is the perception that the government’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis has certainly not included adjectives that are more commonly associated with the Singapore government, such as clarity and decisiveness,” Workers’ Party chief Pritam Singh said in a speech to parliament on Friday. He said citizens have the right to expect a “thorough review and accounting” of the government’s response.This is first time the party has commented on how the government has handled the crisis overall, though it recently called for more clarity on how campaigning rules would be modified in view of the pandemic. The People’s Action Party has held power since Singapore’s independence in 1965 and is widely expected to win an election that must be held by early next year. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, the son of founding premier Lee Kuan Yew, has signaled he intends to step aside by the time he turns 70 in 2022.In the administration’s handling of the virus outbreak, Singh said the public seemed to be confused by “many piecemeal announcements, U-turns and positions that didn’t gel intuitively,” such as limiting visits to relatives even after safe-distancing rules on public transport were lifted.The opposition leader took exception with the government’s resistance to requisitioning mask supplies as other nations had done, “probably with an eye on the future so that international companies would always see Singapore as a reliable place to do business.”Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said in parliament on Friday that the government consulted a wide range of people to decide on its response. The government so far has announced S$93 billion ($67 billion) of stimulus, of which Heng said 80% is committed to helping supporting businesses and workers in the city-state, where unemployment is expected to rise to a record of more than 100,000 this year.In a separate speech to the legislature Friday, Workers’ Party member Leon Perera criticized the administration’s “technocratic zeal” in issuing too many rules that were often qualified or changed after being announced. He suggested the government should consider leaving the choice to business owners on how they would like to resume operations while still adhering to safe distancing rules.“We need to find the right balance between protecting livelihoods and protecting lives,” Perera said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-opposition-leader-pritam-singh-calls-for-review-of-covid-19-response/story-MePKekgm7QGpbxDbxf0QzI.html

Video footage posted on social media showed a boy escaping from the blazing car with burns on parts of his body and begging for water. The ministry said the video was genuine and Afghans in Iran were trying to identify the victims.The boy’s plea of “give me some water, I am burning” was widely circulated on social media and taken up by rights group demanding justice.“Iran has no right to kill Afghan refugees, they can seal their borders, expel all Afghans but not kill them,” said Ali Noori, a lawyer and rights activist said on Facebook.Afghans have for decades sought refuge in Iran from war and poverty in their homeland.Iran says about 2.5 million Afghan migrants, both legal and undocumented, live there. Facing its own economic problems worsened by international sanctions, Iran has at times tried to send Afghans home.Last month, Afghan officials said Iranian border guards killed 45 Afghan migrant workers by forcing them at gunpoint into a mountain torrent on the border.At the time, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi issued a statement saying only that the incident in question had taken place on Afghan soil.Iranian embassy officials in Afghan capital, Kabul were not immediately available for comment on the latest incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghans-condemn-iranian-police-after-refugees-killed-in-car-blaze/story-I1MoPXTiOAFSuhu5loAt9H.html
06-06-2020||World||Multi-pronged approach on line as drug-makers race to develop Covid-19 vaccine: Top updates||Coronavirus cases across the globe are inching toward a grim milestone. Globally, the number of Covid-19 infections will soon touch the 7 million-mark. What started with a few hundred cases in the Chinese city of Wuhan last December, went on to take the shape of a pandemic, sparing no corners of the world. With the rapid rise in the number of infections, the imminent need to arrive at a vaccine for coronavirus grows more urgent. A report published in the medical journal the Lancet describes vaccine development as “typically a long game”. “The US Food and Drug Administration only approved the first vaccine against Ebola virus last year,” it states. However, pharmaceutical and drug-making companies across the world are leaving no stone unturned to arrive at the Covid-19 vaccine. Ten vaccines against Covid-19 are in the clinical trials phase. Researchers at the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca hope to have the first phase 3 data in hand this summer. “Although many infectious disease experts argue that even 18 months for a first vaccine is an incredibly aggressive schedule, a few optimists believe that hundreds of millions of doses of vaccine might be ready for roll-out by the end of 2020,” the Lancet report states. Here are the latest developments:• Moderna’s mRNA-1273, which entered into clinical trials just 66 days after SARS-CoV-2 was first sequenced, showcases the potential for nucleotide-based vaccines, the Lancet report states. • “The University of Oxford and AstraZeneca have embraced a recombinant vaccine called AZD1222 to achieve a similar effect, engineering a chimpanzee adenovirus to carry DNA for the spike antigen,” the report read.• Other candidates like Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline are working together on a protein subunit approach. The two companies hope to start a phase 1 trial later this year.Also read: 9,887 Covid-19 cases in India in 24 hours, 294 deaths in highest single-day jump• Biopharma major AstraZeneca has entered into an agreement with the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), among other world-wide vaccine manufacturers, to produce the vaccine currently under trial at the University of Oxford on a mass scale, if successful.• AstraZeneca cancer drug shows promising results in the fight against Covid-19, Bloomberg reported. The study was conducted on a small group of 19 people wherein experts found that a cancer drug from AstraZeneca could be repurposed to help Covid-19 patients experiencing extreme immune reactions.• Indian drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd said on Friday it was testing a plant-derived drug, AQCH, for the potential treatment of Covid-19 as part of a mid-stage trial, with results expected by October.• Clinical trials of phytopharmaceutical ACQH began on Friday, said S Mande, director-general, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. “We’re going to try it against Covid-19. It’s historic in modern medicine, especially in India. We’ve a chance to tap our traditional knowledge system and its limitless possibilities,” he said.

06-06-2020||World||UK halts trial of hydroxychloroquine as ‘useless’ for Covid-19 patients||British scientists halted a major drug trial on Friday after it found that the anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine, touted by US President Donald Trump as a potential “game changer” in the pandemic, was “useless” at treating COVID-19 patients. “This is not a treatment for Covid-19. It doesn’t work,” Martin Landray, an Oxford University professor who is co-leading the RECOVERY trial, told reporters.“This result should change medical practice worldwide. We can now stop using a drug that is useless.”Vocal support from Trump raised expectations for the decades-old drug that experts said could have been a cheap and widely available tool, if proven to work, in fighting the pandemic, which has infected more than 6.4 million people and killed nearly 400,000 worldwideControversy surrounding the drug grew after a study published in medical journal The Lancet last month raised safety concerns and led several Covid-19 studies of it to be halted. The Lancet study was then retracted on Thursday after its authors said they were unsure about its data.Landray, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Oxford University, noted the “huge speculation” about the drug as a treatment for Covid-19 but said there had been until now “an absence of reliable information from large randomised trials”.He said the preliminary results from RECOVERY, which was a randomised trial, were now quite clear: hydroxychloroquine does not reduce the risk of death among hospitalised patients with Covid-19.“If you’re admitted to hospital, don’t take hydroxychloroquine,” he said.The RECOVERY trial of hydroxychloroquine had randomly assigned 1,542 Covid-19 patients to hydroxychloroquine and compared them with 3,132 Covid-19 patients randomly assigned to standard care without the drug.Results showed no significant difference in death rates after 28 days, in length of stay in hospital or in other outcomes, the researchers said.The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday it would resume tests of hydroxychloroquine as part of its ‘Solidarity’ trials, after those running the study briefly stopped giving it to new patients in light of the Lancet paper.Peter Horby, an Oxford University professor who is co-leading the RECOVERY trial with Landray, said his team had informed the WHO of their decision to halt the UK study.“There was a call this morning with the WHO to give them a heads-up on the results... They... said they would be convening their committee to look again at their decision regarding the Solidarity trial.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-halts-trial-of-hydroxychloroquine-as-useless-for-covid-19-patients/story-unzopJyzvxyOMideSzCTsM.html
06-06-2020||World||Pak court issues notice to Imran Khan in Shahbaz’s defamation case||A Pakistani court has issued a notice to Prime Minister Imran Khan in a defamation case filed by PML-N president Shahbaz Sharif seeking early hearing of his suit against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman, pending for three years.Prime Minister Khan in April 2017 alleged that Shahbaz offered him USD 61 million through a “common friend” to withdraw the Panama Papers case in the Supreme Court against 70-year-old former prime minister and his elder brother Nawaz Sharif. Sharif, who is currently in London for treatment, is the supremo of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). He was disqualified as prime minister in 2017 by the Supreme Court in 2017 in the Panama Papers case.Three corruption cases - Avenfield properties, Flagship investment and Al-Azizia steel mills - were registered against the Sharif family by the anti-graft body in 2017 following a judgment by the Supreme Court that disqualified him.However, Khan did not name the person who offered him USD 61 million on behalf of the Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly Shahbaz.Lahore’s Additional District and Sessions Court on Friday took up Shahbaz’s application for early hearing on June 10 in which he pleaded that (Prime Minister) Khan failed to file a written reply for the last three years causing no substantial proceedings in the case.“In total 60 hearings in this case, Khan’s lawyer sought adjournment on 33 occasions. In the last hearing, the court was told that lead counsel advisor to Khan, Babar Awan could not travel from Islamabad to Lahore due to COVID-19 and the court adjourned hearing for June 22,” a counsel for Shahbaz told the court.Under the law, he said Awan cannot appear before the court to defend PM Khan since he has become his advisor.In his petition, Shahbaz requested the court to issue a decree for recovery of USD 61 million as compensation for the publication of defamatory content in his favour for causing great damage to his reputation in the public.After hearing the arguments, Additional District & Sessions Judge Sohail Anjum issued notice to Prime Minister Khan for June 10 to submit a written reply.Talking to the media after the court issued notice to Prime Minister Khan, PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Auranzeb said: “Imran will no longer qualify on Article 62, 63 of the Constitution if he fails to submit a response in the Rs10bn defamation case. I challenge Imran Khan to answer in court over his allegation of Rs10bn hush money offered by Shehbaz Sharif to him.” She said if on Jun 10 Imran fails to submit an answer in the court he will be “officially stamped” as a “liar” and will no longer be morally eligible to hold the office of a member of the National Assembly and the Prime Minister of Pakistan.“Does a liar, incompetent and unqualified person deserve to be the leader of the Pakistani nation,” she asked.Auranzeb further said Imran has been an absconder in this case for the past three years, and has delayed proceedings 33 times. “Similarly, for the last six years he had been an absconder from the foreign funding case and for the past two years over the 23 secret accounts case,” she lamented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-court-issues-notice-to-imran-khan-in-shahbaz-s-defamation-case/story-ciL3NCDnJsV2yPERLT7JIP.html
06-06-2020||World||Minneapolis, California move to end police neck restraints||The Minneapolis City Council on Friday voted to end use of chokeholds and neck restraints like that used by a white police officer who pressed his knee into the neck of unarmed black man George Floyd on May 25, sparking coast-to-coast protests.In California, Governor Gavin Newsom said he would end state police training in carotid restraints similar to the technique used on Floyd by former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin while three officers stood by and watched as Floyd died after pleading for his life. The Minneapolis police fired all four officers, and they have been charged with murder. The incident has communities across the United States reconsidering use of such restraints.The Minneapolis decision came in response to a Minnesota state human rights complaint against the city. In a proposed court order that must be approved by a judge, the Minneapolis City Council said it would ban all chokeholds and neck holds, and require any member of the police department to immediately report any unauthorized use of force by an officer.“Black, Indigenous, and communities of color have suffered generational pain and trauma as a result of systemic and institutional racism and long-standing problems in policing,” said the proposed order which the council approved unanimously.San Diego County in California this week also banned the carotid restraint, in which an officer blocks the flow of blood to a detainee’s brain, leading to unconsciousness.Newsom said he supports legislation to ban use of the technique in local police departments throughout California.“At the end of the day the carotid hold is literally designed to stop people’s blood from flowing into their brain,” Newsom said. “That has no place any longer.”Many police departments have ended the use of so-called chokeholds, which put pressure on a detainee’s windpipe, but have still allowed carotid restraints.

06-06-2020||World||Trump ‘promises’ India, China will find more Covid-19 cases with more tests||US President Donald Trump has said that countries like India and China would have much more coronavirus cases than America if they conduct more tests.Trump, in his remarks at Puritan Medical Products in Maine, said that the US has carried out 20 million tests.Compared to the US, Germany is at four million and much talked about South Korea is about three million tests, he said on Friday.According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the US has reported nearly 1.9 million cases and over 1,09,000 deaths while the total number of coronavirus cases in India and China stand at 2,36,184 and 84,177 respectively.India has so far conducted over 4 million coronavirus tests, according to the health ministry.Commenting on the Covid-19 tests in the US, Trump said: “We will be well over 20 million tests. Remember this, when you test more, you have more cases.“I say to my people every time we test; you find cases because we do more testing. If we have more cases, if we wanted to do testing in China or in India or other places, I promise you there would be more cases… you are doing a fantastic job in getting out the swabs”.Puritan is one of the only manufacturers in the world producing the high-quality medical swabs that are crucial for rapid testing.“And every swab you make at Puritan is proudly stamped with the beautiful phrase made in the USA.“Thanks to the testing capacity that you are making possible, our country is reopening and our economy is recovering like nobody would’ve thought possible,” he said.Referring to the latest monthly employment numbers, Trump said that the economy is now back on track.“We absolutely shattered expectations, and this is the largest monthly jobs increase in American history, think of that; that’s a long time.“I think it’s more than double or about double of what our highest was before so this is the largest monthly job increase in American history. And we’re going to have a phenomenal next year. We’re going to have a tremendous couple of months prior to the election on November 3 very, very important date,” the president said.Seeking re-election for his second consecutive term, Trump is pitted against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in November 3 presidential elections. Most of the opinion polls shows that Biden is several points ahead of Trump.“It’s going to be a very important election because the only thing that can screw it up is if you get the wrong president and they raise your taxes, and they open up your borders so that everybody pours into our country,” Trump said.Reiterating that he has built a strong economy in the last three years, Trump vowed to bring the economy back on track, which has been badly hit by the coronavirus pandemic.Describing the fight against coronavirus as the greatest national and industrial mobilisation since the World War II, Trump said that his administration has marshaled the full power of the US government and US industry to defeat the invisible enemy.“It is indeed an enemy. It came from China, should have been stopped in China. They didn’t do that,” he alleged.The administration, he said, has delivered over 1.5 billion pieces of personal protective equipment to doctors and nurses on the front lines. “We slashed the red tape to speed up the development of vaccines. And vaccines are coming along incredibly well, wait till you see, and therapeutics. And we partnered at private sector leaders such as Puritan to build the largest and most advanced testing capacity on the face of the earth, like this one,” he said.The Puritan factory in Maine, he said, quickly ramped up the production to produce nearly 20 million foam tipped swabs each month.“Then in April, my administration invoked the Defence Production Act to help you scale up even more. Under a USD 75 million public-private partnership, Puritan will soon double production to 40 million swabs per month,” Trump added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-promises-india-china-will-find-more-covid-19-cases-with-more-tests/story-ISgpS3x559YC4eq5msahsL.html
06-06-2020||World||Who are Antifa, the ‘boogaloo’ movement and others blamed in US protest violence?||President Donald Trump and his allies have sought to blame left-wing extremists for the violence and looting at US protests over police brutality while local authorities and watchdog groups have pointed to the threat posed by right-wing movements.A recent US intelligence assessment reviewed by Reuters this week said most of the violence at protests appears to have been driven by opportunists. But the assessment also said there was some evidence that organized extremists were tied to violence or promoting it online.WHICH GROUPS ARE BEING SINGLED OUT?President Donald Trump and some fellow Republicans have sought to blame the left-wing anti-fascist Antifa movement but have presented little evidence.Liberal watchdog groups and some local authorities have warned that members of the anti-government “boogaloo” movement or white supremacist groups could infiltrate protests.Federal prosecutors filed charges this week against three alleged boogaloo members accused of plotting to cause violence and destruction at Las Vegas protest.WHAT IS ANTIFA?Antifa, short for “anti-fascist,” is an amorphous movement whose adherents oppose people or groups they consider authoritarian or racist, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which monitors extremists. Antifa aims to “intimidate and dissuade racists,” but its aggressive tactics including physical confrontations can create “a vicious, self-defeating cycle of attacks, counter-attacks and blame,” the ADL said.The FBI has been increasingly concerned about violence perpetrated by Antifa at public events, according to a 2018 report by the Congressional Research Service, a public policy research arm of the US Congress.WHY IS ANTIFA SO WELL-KNOWN?Antifa grew in notoriety following a 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, organized by white supremacists and white nationalists who clashed violently with counter-protesters. Trump drew criticism afterward when he said there were “very fine people on both sides” and blamed “many sides” for the violence. Trump specifically mentioned Antifa.“You know, they show up in the helmets and the black masks, and they’ve got clubs and they’ve got everything,” Trump said of Antifa days after the rally.Mark Bray, author of “Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,” said Trump was focusing on Antifa to redirect the conversation away from social and economic discontent in the United States at the heart of the protests. “There just aren’t enough members of Antifa groups out there to do everything they’re being blamed for,” said Bray, a lecturer in history at Rutgers University in New Jersey.WHAT IS THE BOOGALOO MOVEMENT?The anti-government boogaloo movement embodies a militant ideology whose members believe the United States will enter into a second civil war, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. Boogaloo followers anticipate the government will attempt to confiscate people’s guns.The boogaloo ideology itself is not white supremacist, but some white supremacist groups have embraced it, the ADL found.“Whereas the militia movement (and) radical gun rights activists typically promote the boogaloo as a war against the government or liberals, white supremacists conceive of the boogaloo as a race war or a white revolution,” the ADL wrote in a November analysis.Boogaloo groups have grown in popularity online in the past year. The Tech Transparency Project, a Washington-based tech watchdog group, found tens of thousands of people joined boogaloo-related Facebook groups over a 30-day period in March and April as stay-at-home orders took effect across the United States to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. Project researchers found discussions about tactical strategies, weapons and creating explosives in some boogaloo Facebook groups. WHAT ABOUT WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND WHITE NATIONALISTS?A small number of white supremacists and white nationalists have been spotted at recent protests, according to watchdog groups and media reports. The Nationalist Social Club, a neo-Nazi group, appeared to have had some presence at protests in Boston and Knoxville, Tennessee, the ADL said. Members of the far-right Proud Boys were seen at North Carolina and Oregon protests last weekend, according to media reports.Nate Snyder, a former US Department of Homeland Security counter-terrorism official, said it is likely anarchists were among the protesters in recent days, but doubted they would pose a credible violent threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-are-antifa-the-boogaloo-movement-and-others-blamed-in-us-protest-violence/story-udOQzAsl7aO1wg05ba3BqM.html

He was 87.His family said Yokota died of natural causes in a hospital in Kawasaki, near Tokyo, on Friday, before he was able to meet his daughter again.“My husband and I did our best together, but he passed before seeing Megumi again. Now I’m at a loss,” his wife Sakie, 84, said in a statement.Megumi disappeared in 1977 on her way home from her a junior high school in Niigata on Japan’s northern coast when she was 13. It was the day after she gave her father a comb as a birthday gift, a memento he always carried with him.Shigeru Yokota has died. He was 87. He was the father of Megumi Yokota, who was abducted by North Korea.We wonder how he was feeling as he waited to be reunited with his daughter. Please, please rest in peace. I am sad. pic.twitter.com/ngKgCwKdbjA former Central Bank official, Yokota, and his wife kept looking for Megumi and found out 20 years later that she had been abducted to North Korea by its agents.In 1997, Yokota founded a group with other abduction victims’ families and headed it for a decade. The smiling and soft-spoken Yokota became the face of the campaign that eventually gained government backing.The Yokotas had traveled around Japan carrying their daughter’s photos. An image of an innocent-looking teenager in a school uniform became a rallying cry for their cause.After years of denial, North Korea in 2002 acknowledged abducting 13 Japanese. Japan maintains that the North abducted at least 17 people to train agents in Japanese language and culture to spy on rival South Korea.Five of the abductees were allowed to return home for a visit later that year and have since stayed. North Korea says eight others, including Megumi, had died and denies that the other four entered its territory. Their families and the Japanese government disagree.North Korea sent samples of what it said were Megumi’s ashes but DNA examination by the Japanese government showed they were not hers and were mixed with non-human remains.In 2014, the Yokotas traveled to Mongolia to meet a daughter Megumi gave birth to in North Korea, but Megumi was not there.Japan and North Korea have no diplomatic ties, and efforts to resolve the abductions have since largely stalled. Many elderly relatives say they’re running out of time to see their loved ones.Yokota stepped down as the group’s leader in 2007 due to declining health, though he continued to make public appearances though did not speak in public for the last four years.“I’m filled with regret and sadness that we haven’t been able to bring (Megumi) back,” Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters Friday. He renewed his pledge to bring the abductees home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/father-of-north-korea-abduction-victim-dies-without-meeting-his-daughter/story-omy75mmKJidyvNGY89WS6M.html

To date, G20 members and invited countries have pledged over US$21 billion to support funding in global health,” the group said in a statement.The pledges will be directed towards diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics, and research and development, the statement added.In April the group called on all countries, non-governmental organizations, philanthropies and the private sector to help close a financing gap estimated at over $8 billion to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.Saudi Arabia, the current G20 chair has pledged $500 million to support global efforts to combat the pandemic. It said then it would allocate $150 million to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation, $150 million to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisations, and $200 million to other health organisations and programmes.At least 391,108 people have died globally from COVID-19 and more than 6.68 million people have been infected by the novel coronavirus that causes it, following an outbreak that started in Wuhan, China, in early December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g20-pledges-more-than-21-billion-to-fight-coronavirus/story-sGVn4JSGd5mpxHJvvCwM3O.html
06-06-2020||World||Rage against Spain PM Pedro Sanchez is tearing the nation apart||Spaniards are getting really worked up about Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. At one point last month, the defaced image of the photogenic Socialist was plastered across a giant red banner hung in downtown Madrid.The trigger has been his widely-criticized handling of the coronavirus pandemic that has seen Spain suffer among the highest death tolls in Europe. But as the worst of the trauma starts to fade, the vitriol has only gotten worse. The opposition is stirring legitimate criticism with paranoia, crackpot conspiracy theories and ancient resentments into a toxic brew.The country is emerging from its three-month lockdown now. But the backlash in the capital is growing — one penthouse has been raining down anti-government leaflets on protesters gathered in the street below.The anger is palpable on social media feeds and in parliament, where 48-year-old Sanchez scraped together enough votes to extend his state-of-emergency powers this week with the furious opposition dredging up his coalition partner’s ties to Venezuela to paint the prime minister as a wannabe authoritarian.“We’re fighting for Spain,” said Jose Luis Marin as he led a few dozen pan-banging marchers through one of the capital’s swankiest neighborhoods. He was brandishing a 3-meter long Spanish flag with the word “Libertad” —  freedom — scrawled across it.In truth, tensions were always bubbling under the surface and the virus has simply turned up the temperature in Spain’s long-running culture wars. Broad swathes of the population questioned Sanchez’s legitimacy from the moment he took office.“I’m fascinated by the absolute hatred for Pedro Sanchez in certain parts of the right,” Roger Senserrich, a political scientist based in New Haven, Connecticut, observed on Twitter. “He’s a pretty normal politician, mediocre in almost everything, just as ambitious as any other leader of a national party and probably just as (in)competent. But my god, the hatred. It’s brutal.”A spokesman for the prime minister declined to comment.Spain is a young democracy that emerged from a military dictatorship in late 1970s to become one of Europe’s most thriving and socially liberal economies — and yet its politics remain fiercely partisan with sharp ideological fault lines reminiscent of the US under Donald Trump or Boris Johnson’s Brexit Britain.Sanchez is just as polarizing. That makes it almost impossible to imagine how its politicians will find common cause as it seeks a path out of a devastating recession.“The right always tends to be very personal in its attacks,” said Ignacio Urquizu, a sociologist and former Socialist lawmaker. “It focuses on the leader.”The images from the US over the past week show how quickly order can break down when you put together longstanding divisions, acute economic hardship and a burning sense of injustice. To be sure, Spain has seen nothing like the Black Lives Matter protests as yet, but it has some of the same ingredients. And a few of its own.For many of the conservative voters who make up about a third of the Spanish electorate, Sanchez’s original sin was to forge an alliance with the radical left group Podemos and the separatists of Catalonia and the Basque Country.Those groups came together in a 2018 no-confidence vote to oust the center-right People’s Party, which had been limping along since losing its majority three years earlier.Conservatives objected, with some justification, that Sanchez was lining up with lawmakers that wanted to undermine Spain’s constitutional order or, in the case of the Catalans, had actually tried to break up the country. They say his willingness to cut deals with those groups now to keep his minority coalition in power betrays his lack of scruples.“They’ve watched too many TV shows like Game of Thrones and House of Cards,” says PP official Javier Fernandez-Lasquetty, economy chief for the Madrid region. “That’s not how politics works in real life.”Parliamentary rules require any no-confidence motion to propose an alternative premier, so it’s highly unlikely the PP can force Sanchez out. All the same, at the start of the pandemic there was a moment of national unity. When Sanchez declared the state of emergency in March, not even the far-right group Vox voted against him.It didn’t last.Spain has been in the grip of a slow-motion constitutional crisis since 2015. Four general elections in that period have failed to produce even one stable executive, stirring up memories and grudges from the Civil War almost a century ago. The virus eventually made all that worse.With the PP controling Madrid, which has been at the epicenter of the outbreak, the tensions have been focused in the capital.When Sanchez started to lift restrictions in the rest of the country, Madrid and Barcelona were kept under lockdown and resentments started to build. Regional leaders said that the government’s criteria were neither transparent nor objective.“It was a pure show of force,” Lasquetty said in an interview. “Madrid felt mistreated. That explains what happened in May.”As relations unraveled, Madrid President Isabel Diaz Ayuso turned up an hour and a half late for one appointment with Sanchez and walked out of another. When the state of emergency expires on June 21, she will have much more control over the next phase of the capital’s reopening.Sanchez is losing his special powers at a moment when he’s struggling for control on various fronts.On top of the backlash on the streets, the prime minister has found himself embroiled in a fight with the Civil Guard, the country’s biggest police force. One of the force’s most senior officers was fired after it emerged that his officers had prepared a report critical of the government’s handling of the coronavirus, prompting cries of interference.Meanwhile protesters have been openly defying the terms of the lockdown. Those actions that have led to tens of thousands of fines in the rest of the country. But police in Madrid have on the whole turned a blind eye, perhaps wary of inflaming the situation.“If the economic situation gets worse, there is a chance that it may all expand beyond Madrid,” says Urquizu.The opposition is doing all it can to fan the flames and Pablo Iglesias, deputy prime minister and Podemos’s leader, is a lightning rod. The scruffy former academic, nicknamed derisively “the Ponytail” in reference to his trademark long hair, spent time in Caracas advising the Hugo Chavez government before setting up his party.When the 41-year-old first took his seat in parliament, he provocatively planted a kiss full on the mouth of a male colleague right in front of the conservative economy chief Luis de Guindos, to roars of approval from his party.In a heated debate in parliament last week, the PP’s main spokeswoman Cayetana Alvarez de Toledo dredged up Iglesias’s links to the left-wing government that has ravaged Venezuela for a generation. Alvarez de Toledo, an Oxford-educated aristocrat with an exotic-sounding Argentinian accent in Spanish, said the government is seeking to undermine independent state-institutions by appointing cronies and labeled Iglesias the son of a terrorist — a reference to his father’s activism during the dictatorship.“You have a plan, it’s true, it’s a plan against democracy,” Alvarez de Toledo, 45, said. “You want to create an authoritarian left-wing regime.”Those arguments mutate as they filter through the protests on the streets of the capital where angry, confused people are trying to process the events of the past few months.“They have done it badly on purpose,” said Carmen Corbera, at one protest, a Spanish flag stitched onto the side of her face mask and another pinned to her shoulders like a cape. “It was convenient for them to establish the communist regime that Pedro and Pablo want for Spain.”To be clear, there is zero evidence either that the pandemic was deliberately mishandled, or that the government is plotting to set up a communist regime.A Chavista takeover is not the real threat for Spain.The danger is that the country’s entrenched political factions are increasingly inhabiting parallel realities and leaving the country unable to face its mounting challenges. The lines at food banks are growing and in the weeks to come more and more people are likely to be sitting at home, out of work, and looking for someone to blame.Spain needs a prime minister to revive the battered economy, to stabilize the public finances and then get to work on the difficult process of fixing the democratic system.But like millions of his country’s people, Sanchez is just trying to get to the end of the month.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rage-against-spain-pm-pedro-sanchez-is-tearing-the-nation-apart/story-OrDfhowAHyNh50kZkhIkoN.html
06-06-2020||World||George Floyd’s death sparks new generation of activists in US||Kristina Knox, a 25-year-old child development teacher from Maryland, cried for days after watching video footage of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man in Minneapolis who died after a police officer kneeled on his neck while Floyd gasped for air.She had posted about high-profile episodes of police brutality wielded against black Americans on her social media accounts before she attended her first protest this week - spurred, in part, by hoping to create a better world for her two-year-old son.“I’m over being walked over, mentally, physically, emotionally,” Knox said at a protest outside the US Capitol. “Enough is enough.”Floyd’s death has sparked protests nationwide and around the world, engulfing city streets with thousands of demonstrators.Many of the demonstrators who milled around the US Capitol this week were black people in their twenties who, like Knox, had felt compelled after Floyd’s death to march on the streets for the first time.The US has been rocked by demonstrations over police killing of unarmed black men, women and boys over the past decade. During the most widespread protests, after the fatal shooting of teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, many of the protesters in Washington D.C. this week were just teens themselves.New demonstrators said they had been driven to protest after seeing too many videos and hearing too many stories about black Americans dying at the hands of police officers - and by their concerns about the future of the country itself.“It’s not to say that Ferguson did not anger us, but there’s definitely something different about this moment, especially because it is an election year,” said Arianna Evans, 23, a political science student, who attends Prince George’s Community College in Maryland.“We’re grappling with the soul of this country this year,” Evans said. If US President Donald Trump isn’t voted out of office, and a new generation doesn’t push for the reforms they want, “we may never see that chance.” The protests are broadly popular among Americans. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, 64% of American adults were sympathetic and 55% of Americans disapprove of the way Trump handled them.Trump, who is seeking re-election in November, has suggested to some governors to call in the National Guard.While it is not clear exactly how many people taking to the streets in protests over the past nine days are first-timers, organizers say the number of new protesters is significant.Freedom Fighters DC, a newly formed group that has hosted multiple demonstrations within Washington, said that about 150 were first-time protesters of the 500 or so protesters outside the Capitol building on Wednesday. Alayshia Florida, 20, a self-described first-time protester who is headed to nursing school this fall, convinced a white officer to kneel with her outside the US Capitol Wednesday, amid cheers. “It’s time we change how police officers view us by inviting them to see us as human beings,” she said. Asked what made this moment different, Kelsey Marshman, a 29-year-old mail handler, said: “It’s 2020! This should not be happening still. It really shouldn’t. I’m sick of there being video and these police (officers) not being held accountable for that.”The protesters’ demands include better police-sensitivity training, more serious background checks and convictions against the police officers involved in the case.Derek Chauvin, the police officer who pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, has been charged with second-degree murder. Minnesota sentencing guidelines suggest that someone convicted for second-degree murder without a criminal history receive between 22 and 30 years in prison. But Christa Groshek, a defense attorney in Minneapolis, said prosecutors would likely seek more than that if they secure a conviction against Chauvin.Minnesota also filed a civil rights charge against the Minneapolis Police Department over Floyd’s death and said it would investigate the department for systemic discriminatory practices.On the hot, sunny day in Washington on Wednesday, volunteers passed out water and hand sanitizer, in a bid to minimize risks from the coronavirus pandemic.Most protesters wore masks as they held up handmade signs bearing phrases like “Black Lives Matter,” “Stop Shooting” and “There comes a time when silence is betrayal.”“The people rose up against oppression in 2020. Were we successful stopping it? I doubt it,” said Lorenzo Bell, 36. “But did we just let them do it? ... No.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-s-death-sparks-new-generation-of-activists-in-us/story-oCWQuQHllIhYgedg8xPiVL.html
06-06-2020||World||China’s ‘salami-slicing tactics’ displays disregard for India’s efforts at peace||The current Sino-India border crisis has revealed that China has little respect for India’s long-standing efforts to freeze status quo along its frontiers, a top US observer on South Asia has claimed.Ashley Tellis, Tata Chair for Strategic Affairs and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that by its brazen actions, Beijing has forced New Delhi to join the rest of Asia in figuring out how to deal with the newest turn in China’s “salami-slicing tactics”.“The current Sino-Indian border crisis has revealed that China has little respect for India’s long-standing efforts to freeze the status quo along the two countries’ disputed frontiers or for New Delhi’s cautious efforts to avoid the appearance of balancing against Beijing,” he said.Rather, treating India’s internal actions regarding Jammu and Kashmir as a provocation, it has chosen to expand its control over new parts of the Himalayan borderlands through brazen actions that confront India with the difficult choice of either lumping its losses or escalating through force if the negotiations presently underway yield meager returns, Tellis wrote in his latest research paper.“By so doing, it has forced India to join the rest of Asia in figuring out how to deal with the newest turn in China’s salami-slicing tactics, which now distinctively mark its trajectory as a rising power,” he said. Unlike the discrete and geographically localised confrontations of the past, the latest encounters are occurring at multiple locations along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh in the eastern section of Jammu and Kashmir, which suggests a high degree of Chinese premeditation and approval for its military’s activities from the very top, Tellis claimed.“The unfortunate truth is that China, having exploited the initiative to seize pieces of India’s claimed territory, can now hold on to its new acquisitions forever unless India chooses to eject Chinese troops by force or decides to impose tit-for-tat costs on China by symmetrically occupying other pockets in disputed territory where it possesses a tactical advantage,” he said.This rejoinder admittedly carries risks because China could parry such Indian actions using its significant reserves already deployed at key locations along the front, in which case the stage would be set for perhaps a wider confrontation, he noted.Tellis said the pattern of Chinese patrolling since the late 1990s suggests that Beijing seeks to eventually control the entire the Aksai Chin plateau, on which parts of Ladakh are located.China has laid claim to this region since the 1950s, but as the Sino-Indian rivalry has increased after the Cold War, Beijing has attempted to gradually bring bits and pieces of the disputed frontier under its de facto authority, he said.The term de facto authority itself is inadequate in this context because, in the absence of maps that clearly delineate which areas each side actively controls, China’s creeping appropriation of territory cannot be either contested or contained except by physical Indian obstruction, Tellis noted.“On this count, Chinese actions have been singularly mischievous: although both countries have long committed to exchanging maps describing their presence in the disputed territories as the first step toward a boundary settlement, Beijing has thus far consistently declined to follow through on its obligations,” Tellis wrote in his paper.In large measures, this is because accepting any Indian map that marks an extant Indian presence would make it difficult for China to claim that territory in future negotiations. What China actually wants is the entirety of the disputed borderlands simply on the strength of its claim that it once possessed them, he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-salami-slicing-tactics-displays-disregard-for-india-s-efforts-at-peace/story-ujHFW5zcwTbKiP7j0QghGL.html
06-06-2020||World||Covid-19: Mexico alleges some doctors sold false death certificates||Mexico City officials said Friday that prosecutors are investigating several doctors who allegedly issued false death certificates for people who may have died of the coronavirus.As deaths mount in Mexico, the need to quickly dispose of corpses has apparently led to a black market in death certificates. Mexico reported 625 newly confirmed Covid-19 deaths Friday, down from a peak of 1,092 on Wednesday and 816 on Thursday. The country now regularly adds more than 4,000 confirmed infections each day, and the cumulative case total stands at over 110,000, though officials acknowledge the real number is many times higher.In describing the investigation, Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum alleged the doctors “were involved in charging for these services,” despite the fact that death certificates are supposed to be free but the process to obtain them can sometimes be lengthy and bureaucratic.“They sold these certificates when they should not have,” Sheinbaum said.The scheme purportedly involved at least one city government employee and around 10 doctors, none of whom were city hospital employees, the mayor said.There are also indications the doctors may have signed off causes of death other than Covid-19 for bodies they had never seen or examined, though the reasons were unclear, officials said.But bodies had been piling up at hospitals in Mexico City as the pandemic worsened, and some relatives may have simply wanted to get their deceased family members released more quickly. In addition, bodies of people who died from Covid-19 have to be cremated or buried under stricter rules so some families may have paid for a false certificate to avoid that or the social stigma the virus carries.No charges have been filed in the case.It would not be the first scandal in Mexico involving businesses that have grown up around the pandemic.In May, authorities found 3.5 tons of hospital waste illegally dumped in the woods on the outskirts of Mexico City. Officials also discovered 6,000 cubic yards (meters) of medical waste piled ceiling high at a warehouse in Puebla state.Teetering piles of discarded coffins, meanwhile, have piled up outside Mexico City’s overworked crematoriums. Specialized waste incinerators are over-taxed by the flood of disposed protective equipment and infectious tissue being generated amid the pandemic.Mexico is plagued by widespread problems with unregulated firms in both the waste disposal and funeral industries. According to the Senate, 60% of funeral agencies in Mexico are either unregistered or not fully registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-mexico-alleges-some-doctors-sold-false-death-certificates/story-HhVTf7wbq0aW466gnQDh0K.html
06-06-2020||World||China issues alert warning against travel to Australia: Report||China has issued a travel alert warning its citizens not to travel to Australia due to a significant increase in racist attacks on Chinese and Asian people, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.The Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism issued the statement on Friday, saying the alleged attacks came in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, ABC News reported.The warning is the latest sign of deteriorating relations between Australia and its largest trading partner after Prime Minister Scott Morrison led calls for an independent probe on the origins of the coronavirus in Wuhan. Australia is the most China-reliant economy in the developed world, leaving it vulnerable to diplomatic blowback.The warning comes after Australia announced a tough new screening regime on foreign investors seeking to buy sensitive assets as it bids to bolster national security. Telecommunications, energy, technology and defense-manufacturing companies will be included in the zero-dollar threshold for screening.The changes, intended to be legislated this year and enforced from Jan. 1, will include a new national security test and give the treasurer last-resort powers to force asset sales. Beijing responded with verbal attacks on the conservative government, saying it was doing the bidding of key ally the U.S.New tariffs on Australian barley and a ban on beef from four meatworks have raised fears in Canberra that the Chinese government is using “economic coercion” in retaliation.Before Australia’s calls for a probe into the origins of the coronavirus, its diplomatic ties with China were already under stress. The government cited Beijing’s “meddling” into national affairs as a catalyst for its anti-foreign interference laws passed in 2018, the same year it banned Huawei Technologies Co. from helping build its 5G network.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-issues-alert-warning-against-travel-to-australia-report/story-YM3KVC8UNz9X3as1rHx4BI.html
06-06-2020||World||Trump orders big US troop cut in Germany, says official||US President Donald Trump has ordered the military to remove 9,500 troops from Germany, a senior US official said on Friday, a move likely to raise concerns in Europe about the US commitment to the continent.The move would reduce US troops numbers in Germany to 25,000, from the 34,500 currently there.The official, who did not want to be identified, said the move was the result of months of work by America’s top military officer, General Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and had nothing to do with tensions between Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who thwarted Trump’s plan to host a G7 meeting this month.A second senior administration official said the 9,500 troops would be sent elsewhere, some to Poland, some to other allied countries, while some would return home.This official said there was less need for the large contingent in Germany due to overall increased defense spending by the US-led NATO military alliance.The second official said the change was ordered in a memorandum signed recently by Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien. The official said the United States started working on the plan in September and had just now got the pieces in place.Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on Senate Armed Services Committee, said the move was “petty and preposterous.”Andrew Weiss of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said the move was a “huge gift” for Russia. “With one fell swoop, Trump is showing once again that our alliances are nothing more than a political plaything,” Weiss said on Twitter. The White House said it had no announcements but Trump “continually reassesses the best posture for the United States military forces.” In the statement, White House National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot said the United States remained committed to working with Germany on defense and other issues. The move, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, is the latest twist in relations between Berlin and Washington, which have often been strained during Trump’s presidency. Trump has pressed Germany to raise defense spending and accused Berlin of being a “captive” of Russia due to its energy reliance.About 17,000 US civilian employees support US troops in Germany. It is believed the United States also has nuclear warheads there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-orders-big-us-troop-cut-in-germany-official-says/story-s78bhcueNCQaSbgeK6nTfO.html

06-06-2020||World||‘No kneeling’: Trump renews criticism of protests during US anthem||President Donald Trump on Friday lobbed barbs at protesters who kneel during the national anthem, after NFL quarterback Drew Brees apologized for remarks he made about the practice.Brees said this week he would “never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag,” referring to the possibility of players kneeling during the “Star-Spangled Banner” in the upcoming NFL season. Brees apologized Thursday, saying his words “lacked awareness and any type of compassion or empathy.”The kneeling pose, popularized by NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, has become a symbol of the fight for racial justice in the United States.Trump tweeted on Friday that Brees “should not have taken back his original stance.”“We should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart,” Trump wrote. “There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag - NO KNEELING!”The kneeling pose has been seen at protests in cities across the country in the wake of the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, while in police custody in Minneapolis.Brees’ initial remarks angered top athletes, who objected to the equating of the protest with disrespecting the American flag.“You literally still don’t understand why Kap was kneeling on one knee??” NBA great LeBron James posted on Twitter earlier this week. “Has absolute nothing to do with the disrespect of Flag of United States and our soldiers(men and women).”Kaepernick popularized the move in 2016, appearing on NFL sidelines first sitting, and later kneeling, during the customary pre-game airing of the US national anthem.Trump was an early critic of the protest, and in 2017 Vice President Mike Pence walked out of an NFL game between the 49ers and the Indianapolis Colts when some of the players knelt on the sidelines during the anthem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-kneeling-trump-renews-criticism-of-protests-during-us-anthem/story-WJS6EJr0lJmf9AcHRtx2yI.html
06-06-2020||World||Biden formally clinches Democratic presidential nomination||Joe Biden formally clinched the Democratic presidential nomination Friday, setting him up for a bruising challenge to President Donald Trump that will play out against the unprecedented backdrop of a pandemic, economic collapse and civil unrest.The former vice president has effectively been his party’s leader since his last challenger in the Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders, ended his campaign in April. But Biden pulled together the 1,991 delegates needed to become the nominee after seven states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries Tuesday.Biden reached the threshold three days after the primaries because several states, overwhelmed by huge increases in mail ballots, took days to tabulate results. Teams of analysts at The Associated Press then parsed the votes into individual congressional districts. Democrats award most delegates to the party’s national convention based on results in individual congressional districts.Biden now has 1,993 delegates, with contests still to come in eight states and three US territories.The moment was met with little of the traditional fanfare as the nation confronts overlapping crises. While Biden has started to venture out more this week, the coronavirus pandemic has largely confined him to his Wilmington, Delaware, home for much of the past three months.The country faces the worst rate of unemployment since the Great Depression. And civil unrest that harkens back to the 1960s has erupted in dozens of cities following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.It’s a confluence of events that no US leader has faced in modern times, made all the more complicated by a president who has at times antagonized the protesters and is eager to take the fight to Biden.Biden spent 36 years in the Senate before becoming Barack Obama’s vice president. This is 77-year-old Biden’s third bid for the presidency and his success in capturing the Democratic nomination was driven by strong support from black voters.He finished an embarrassing fourth place in the overwhelmingly white Iowa caucuses that kicked off the nomination process in February. Biden fared little better in the New Hampshire primary, where his standing was so low that he left the state before polls closed on election night to instead rally black voters in South Carolina.His rebound began in the more diverse caucuses in Nevada but solidified in South Carolina, where Biden stomped Sanders, his nearest rival, by nearly 29 points. He followed that with a dominant showing three days later during the Super Tuesday contests, taking 9 of the 13 states.Biden’s strong showing in states such as North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and Texas reinforced his status as the preferred Democratic candidate of African American voters — but the relationship has not been without its strained moments. After a tense exchange with an influential black radio host, Biden took sharp criticism for suggesting that African American voters still deciding between him and Trump “ain’t black.”That comment, and protests that have spread nationwide, have increased pressure on Biden to pick an African American running mate. He has already committed to picking a woman as a vice presidential candidate.Black voters are unlikely to back Trump over Biden by a wide margin. A recent Fox News poll shows just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of the president compared with 75% who favorably view Biden.But Biden must ensure that black voters are motivated to show up to the polls in November, especially in critical swing states that narrowly went for Trump in 2016.At one point, the Democratic primary included dozens of candidates of different races, genders and generations and an openly gay man. The contest was dominated by debate over unapologetically progressive ideas, including fully government-funded health care under “Medicare for All” and a sweeping proposal to combat climate change known as the “Green New Deal.”Biden prevailed by mostly offering more moderate approaches that he argued would make him more electable against Trump.He refused to budge on his rejection of universal health care and some of the Green New Deal’s most ambitious provisions to combat climate change.Since clinching the nomination, however, Biden has worked to build his appeal among progressives, forming joint task forces with Sanders’ campaign to find common ground on key issues like health care, the economy and the environment. Biden has also embraced a plan to forgive millions of Americans’ student debt, meaning that he clinches the nomination as easily the most liberal standard bearer the Democratic Party has ever had.Biden’s embrace of his party’s left flank could help him consolidate a Democratic base that remained deeply divided after the 2016 primary and ultimately hurt Hillary Clinton in her defeat to Trump. But it could also undermine Biden’s attempts to rebuild the Obama coalition, which is often loosely defined as minorities and young people, as well as educated Americans and some working-class voters.The former vice president has sought, since announcing his candidacy, to cast the election as a battle “for the soul of the nation,” and promised to restore order and dignity to the White House while rehabilitating the U.S. image on the world stage. Such an approach, though, necessarily focuses on being more of an alternative to Trump than offering radically new political ideas. And that further underscores Biden’s difficult task of trying to unite his party’s base while appealing to voters from far beyond it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-formally-clinches-democratic-presidential-nomination/story-sejUoQZzInFJ925BuPFqlK.html
06-06-2020||World||Patten says China pursuing ‘Orwellian’ agenda in Hong Kong||The last British governor of Hong Kong criticized the Chinese government on Friday over proposed national security legislation, calling it part of an “Orwellian” drive to eliminate opposition in violation of the agreement on handing the territory over to Beijing. Chris Patten defended London’s announcement that it would grant residency and a path to citizenship for nearly 3 million Hong Kong residents if Beijing goes through with passage of the legislation. The law is seen as potentially imposing severe restrictions on freedom of speech and opposition political activity in the former British colony that was handed over to Chinese rule in 1997. China has denounced the offer of citizenship as a violation of its sovereignty. “If they’ve broken the (Sino-British) Joint Declaration, if they’ve thrown it overboard, how can they then use the joint declaration as though it stops us doing something that’s a sovereign right of ours?” said Patten, now chancellor of the University of Oxford, in an online talk with reporters. The declaration is a bilateral treaty signed as part of the handover process. China has essentially declared it null and void, while Britain says Beijing is reneging on its commitments made in the document that was supposed to be remain in effect until 2047. China shocked many of Hong Kong’s 7.5 million people when it announced earlier this month that it will enact a national security law for the city, which was promised a high level of autonomy outside of foreign and defense affairs. An earlier push to pass security legislation was shelved after massive Hong Kong street protests against it in 2003. However, Beijing appeared to lose patience after months of sometimes violent anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year that China said was an attempt to split the territory off from the rest of the country. Patten said the security legislation is unnecessary because Hong Kong’s legal code already includes provisions to combat terrorism, financial crimes and other threats to security. “What Beijing wants is something which deals with those rather worrying Orwellian crimes like sedition, whatever that may be,” Patten said. China may also be seeking grounds to disqualify opposition candidates from running in September’s election for the local legislature by accusing them of being disloyal, he said. Beijing has ignored promises that Hong Kong could democratize of its own accord after the handover, Patten said. The US should unite with other democratic countries to oppose underhanded tactics by Beijing, he said. “It’s the Chinese Communist Party which attacks us, which hectors, which bullies, which tells companies which have roots in our countries, that unless they do what China wants, they won’t get any business in China,” Patten said. “That’s the way the Mafia behave, and the rest of the world shouldn’t put up with it, because if we do, liberal democracies are going to be screwed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/patten-says-china-pursuing-orwellian-agenda-in-hong-kong/story-6lL6DjPT5dUsPfyTiKpziP.html

The nation reported another 1,005 deaths Friday night.With more than 35,000 lives lost, the pandemic has killed more people in Brazil than anywhere outside of the United States and the United Kingdom.Asked about efforts to loosen social distancing orders in Brazil despite rising daily death rates and diagnoses, World Health Organization (WHO) spokeswoman Margaret Harris said a key criteria for lifting lockdowns was slowing transmission.“The epidemic, the outbreak, in Latin America is deeply, deeply concerning,” she told a news conference in Geneva. Among six key criteria for easing quarantines, she said, “one of them is ideally having your transmission declining.”In comments to journalists later Friday, Bolsonaro said Brazil will consider leaving the WHO unless it ceases to be a “partisan political organization.”President Donald Trump, an ideological ally of Bolsonaro, said last month that the United States would end its own relationship with the WHO, accusing it of becoming a puppet of China, where the coronavirus first emerged.Bolsonaro’s dismissal of the coronavirus risks to public health and efforts to lift state quarantines have drawn criticism from across the political spectrum in Brazil, where some accuse him of using the crisis to undermine democratic institutions.But many of those critics are divided about the safety and effectiveness of anti-government demonstrations in the middle of a pandemic, especially after one small protest was met with an overwhelming show of police force last weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolsonaro-threatens-who-exit-as-covid-19-kills-a-brazilian-per-minute/story-ciXJHm6usOF6l45NxnezzK.html

We are doing incredibly well. We can have some very positive surprises. Tremendous progress is being made on vaccines,” Trump said during a news conference from the White House.“In fact, we are ready to go in terms of transportation and logistics. We have over two million ready to go if it checks out for safety.”Watch | Donald Trump says US ‘largely through’ coronavirus pandemic Trump also said “likewise, we are doing very well with therapeutics.

And, some similar and somewhat different on the therapeutic front,” he said. He, however, didn’t say which ones have started vaccine production.The National Institutes of Health has been fast-tracking work with biotech firm Moderna on a potential vaccine to prevent Covid-19. White House health advisor Dr Anthony Fauci had said earlier this week that there are at least four trials of potential vaccines that he is either directly or indirectly involved in. Fauci said that by the beginning of 2021 “we hope to have” a couple of million doses.Researchers have been accelerating the development of vaccine candidates by investing in multiple stages of research.Trump even said on Friday that officials “understand the disease now.” However, scientists have said they still don’t fully understand key aspects of the virus, including how immune systems respond once someone is exposed to it.The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US currently stands at 1.87 million and 108,120 people have been killed so far, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-2-million-coronavirus-vaccine-doses-ready-to-go-donald-trump/story-aklv1Z492zfL2mpQfkI7oM.html

He was joined by Somali-Canadian Cabinet colleague Ahmed Hussen, the Minister for Families, Children and Social Development.Trudeau kneeled for nearly nine minutes, at the rally that took place on Parliament Hill in Ottawa. Though videos of the event showed there were scattered shouts of “Go away” from some in the crowd, Trudeau nodded along to chants of ‘Black lives matter’. Some of the shouts also included the term blackface, referring to the multiple photographs and videos of the Prime Minister that emerged late year with his face darkened.The Canadian Prime Minister has been criticized and ridiculed for a 21-second long pause during a recent media briefing when he was asked about the words and actions of United States President Donald Trump. Trudeau did not mention Trump even once in the response that followed the silence. He did not address the protest gathering on Friday. However, Hussen, the only black member of Trudeau’s Cabinet, told the outlet CBC, “I think it’s powerful when you have the head of government taking a knee and clapping when people say ‘black lives matter’.”Trudeau’s presence at the protest comes days after Dr Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, warned against such gathering because of the Covid-19 threat and advised virtual rallies instead.Similar marches also took place in other Canadian cities including Toronto.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-trudeau-joins-a-black-lives-matter-rally-kneels-for-9-minutes/story-z3NftAlkgENXoQ2X2DqS9J.html

His appearance came a day after police shot and killed an indigenous woman during a wellness check in eastern Canada. Demonstrations were held in other Canadian cities on Friday, including Toronto, where hundreds walked downtown in protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, while in police custody in Minnesota.Trudeau three times took a knee alongside other protesters, a gesture used to protest against police brutality and the treatment of African-Americans by police. Afterward, several people thanked Trudeau for kneeling.On Monday, police tear-gassed peaceful protesters outside the White House to make way for President Donald Trump to have his picture taken holding a Bible while standing in front of a church.Asked to comment on Trump’s idea of using soldiers against protesters on Tuesday, the Liberal prime minister paused for more than 20 seconds before he said that Canadians were watching the United States with “horror and consternation.”Trudeau did not speak at the rally Friday and left as the protesters began a march to the US Embassy, near the Parliament building. “What needs to happen is long-term change,” said Sisi Akhigbe, 24, who raised more than C$9,000 online to provide drinks and snacks for the protesters in Ottawa. “We’ve been treated unfairly and we’re tired.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stand-up-to-trump-canada-protesters-shout-to-trudeau-who-kneels-at-anti-racism-rally/story-AkHvydvcjniB0XsvXVhMCO.html
06-06-2020||World||‘A great day for George Floyd,’ says Trump as he hails strong jobs report for US||President Donald Trump on Friday declared it was “a great day” for George Floyd as he discussed a strong jobs report for the country and efforts to bring about racial equality. Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, said Trump’s comments about Floyd were “despicable.”  Trump’s comments about Floyd came as he shifted from discussing a drop in the unemployment rate to say everyone deserved “equal treatment in every encounter with law enforcement, regardless of race, color, gender or creed.” “We all saw what happened last week. We can’t let that happen,” Trump said.  “Hopefully George is looking down right now and saying this is a great thing that’s happening for our country.” He added: “This is a great day for him. It’s a great day for everybody. This is a great day for everybody. This is a great, great day in terms of equality.”  Floyd, who was black, died after a white police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes, ignoring Floyd’s cries that he couldn’t breathe and bystander shouts. Floyd’s death set off protests around the world, including outside the White House.Trump spoke shortly after the government said the unemployment rate had dropped to 13.3%, better than expected but still on par with Great Depression-era levels of joblessness. He offered the data as evidence that the nation had overcome the worst of the coronavirus pandemic and had begun an economic comeback.Biden panned Trump’s comments during an economic speech in Delaware.“We’re speaking of a man who was brutally killed by an act of needless violence and by a larger tide of injustice that has metastasized on this president’s watch,” Biden said.“George Floyd’s last words, ‘I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe,’ have echoed all across this nation and quite frankly around the world,” Biden added. “For the president to try to put any other words in the mouth of George Floyd, I frankly think, is despicable.” Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said some news outlets had “purposely misreported” the president’s comments to insinuate that Floyd would be pleased about the positive jobs numbers. He said Trump was referencing the “national conversation” that followed Floyd’s death and “Americans coming together on the belief that everyone should be treated equally under the law.” “The sentences that preceded and followed the president’s sentiments about Mr. Floyd made the context crystal clear,” Murtaugh said. “Media claims that the president said that Mr. Floyd would be praising the economic news are wrong, purposefully misrepresented, and maliciously crafted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-evokes-floyd-after-hailing-strong-jobs-report/story-24o9MTPitHAtzFd60VATIO.html
06-06-2020||World||Killed al-Qaeda’s North African commander, claims France||French forces have killed Abdelmalek Droukdel, the leader of al-Qaeda’s North Africa affiliate, the France’s defense minister announced late Friday, in what would be a major victory for France after years of battling jihadists in the Sahel.There was no immediate confirmation of his death from al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, known as AQIM, which has made millions of dollars abducting foreigners for ransom over the years and made large swaths of West Africa too dangerous for aid groups to access.French Defense Minister Florence Parly tweeted that Droukdel and several of his allies were killed Wednesday in northern Mali by French forces and their partners. It was not immediately clear how his identity was confirmed by the French.Droukdel’s reported death comes after French President Emmanuel Macron and the leaders of the G5 Sahel group -- Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad -- launched a new plan in January to fight jihadists in the area. France deployed 600 additional soldiers to its Barkhane force, raising the number of troops there to 5,100.In a March video released by the extremist monitoring group SITE, Droukdel urged governments of the Sahel region to try to end the French military presence, calling the troops “armies of occupation.” It was not clear how long Droukdel had been in Mali, Algeria’s southern neighbor. For years he was thought to be holed up in the Kabyle region east of the capital of his native Algeria, and many people had questioned why he was never captured by Algerian security forces, which had honed their counter-terrorism skills over the decades.He was widely seen as the symbolic leader of al Qaeda’s North African branch, whose operational center for attacks shifted to northern Mali over the past decade. That led to the French military invasion of the region in 2013 seeking to counter Islamist extremist designs on southern Mali and the capital, Bamako.Droukdel made his reputation as a feared extremist leader in Algeria, which beginning in the early 1990s was convulsed by violence in what the nation now calls the “black decade.” Droukdel’s al Qaeda affiliate had claimed responsibility for numerous deadly suicide bombings in Algeria, including targeting a United Nations building in Algiers in 2007, shattered by a vehicle packed with explosives.Droukdel, also known by the nom de guerre Abu Musab Abdul Wadud, transformed the Salafist Group for Call and Combat, known as the GSPC, into al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, spreading the movement across Africa’s Sahel region under the umbrella of the global terror network.More recently he had been commanding all the al-Qaeda groups in North Africa and the Sahel, including the JNIM, which has claimed responsibility for devastating attacks on the Malian military and U.N. peacekeepers trying to stabilize the volatile country.Parly identified him as a member of al-Qaeda’s “management committee.” Related anti-terrorist operations in the region also led to the arrest May 19 of a major figure in the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, Mohamed el Mrabat, she said.She said the operations dealt a “severe blow” to terrorist groups in the region that have been operating for years despite the presence of thousands of French, U.N. and other African troops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/killed-al-qaeda-s-north-african-commander-france-s-defense-minister/story-klNoPp9tEYAjb863qkAxHN.html
06-06-2020||World||North Korea threatens to shut liaison office with South||North Korea on Friday threatened to permanently shut a liaison office with South Korea as it continued to condemn its rival for failing to prevent activists from sending anti-North Korean leaflets across the border.The statement by North Korea’s ruling Workers’ Party came a day after the powerful sister of leader Kim Jong Un said the country would end a military agreement reached with South Korea in 2018 to reduce tensions if Seoul fails to stop the activists.Kim Yo Jong also said North Korea could permanently shut the liaison office and a joint factory park in the border town of Kaesong, which have been symbols of reconciliation between the two countries.Desperate to keep alive a faltering diplomacy with North Korea, South Korea in response said it would push new laws to ban activists from flying leaflets by balloon to the North, which triggered a debate over freedom of speech.But an unidentified spokesperson of the Workers’ Party’s inter-Korean affairs department said Seoul’s promise lacked sincerity and the scrapping of the liaison office will be the first in a series of North Korean steps that would cause “extreme fatigue” for the South.The statement also confirmed an elevated status for Kim Yo Jong, who was described as her brother’s top official for inter-Korean affairs.Under her instructions, North Korea has decided as a first step to “abolish the North-South liaison office that is occupying space in the Kaesong industrial complex while doing nothing,” the statement said.“We will not hide that we for a long time have considered decisive measures to completely shut down all spaces of contact with the South and fundamentally eliminate the sources of provocations from the South,” said the spokesperson of the party’s United Front Department.“The latest events have strengthened our conclusion that an enemy is just an enemy...it is our determination to go as far as we can in a vicious cycle of confrontation.” South Korea’s government had no immediate reaction to the statement.Sending balloons across the border has been a common activist tactic for years, but North Korea considers it an attack on its government. Defectors and other activists in recent weeks have used balloons to fly leaflets criticizing Kim Jong Un over his nuclear ambitions and dismal human rights record.While Seoul has sometimes sent police officers to block such activities during sensitive times, it had previously resisted North Korea’s calls to fully ban them, saying the activists were exercising their freedom.The liaison office in Kaesong was one of the main agreements reached in three summits between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in 2018. It has been closed since late January after the Koreas agreed to temporarily shut it until the coronavirus is controlled.Kaesong is also the location of a now-shuttered factory complex that was jointly run by the two Koreas. It combined South Korean capital and technology with cheap North Korean labour. Seoul’s previous conservative government shut it down in 2016 following a North Korean nuclear test, removing a crucial cash source for North Korea’s struggling economy.During their summits in 2018, Kim and Moon issued vaguely worded statements pledging denuclearization and peace. They also agreed to the military pact aimed at reducing conventional threats and vowed to resume operations at the Kaesong factory park and South Korean tours to a resort at North Korea’s Diamond Mountain when possible, expressing optimism that US-led sanctions on the North would end.But North Korea has suspended virtually all cooperation with South Korea in recent months amid a stalemate in larger nuclear negotiations with the Trump administration, which have faltered over disagreements on sanctions relief in exchange for disarmament steps.North Korea has sped up its missile tests while also pressuring Seoul to break away from Washington and restart joint economic projects held back by the sanctions over its nuclear programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-threatens-to-shut-liaison-office-with-south/story-mFy1OEZLJ2uYTc4aDa5yKN.html
06-06-2020||World||EU wants borders free of virus restrictions by end of June||Europe could have its free travel zone up and running again by the end of this month, but travellers from further afield will not be allowed in before July, a European Union commissioner said Friday after talks among the bloc’s interior ministers.Panicked by Italy’s coronavirus outbreak in February, countries in the 26-nation Schengen travel zone — where people and goods move freely without border checks — imposed border restrictions without consulting their neighbours to try to keep the disease out. The moves caused massive border traffic jams and blocked medical equipment.Free movement is a jewel in Europe’s crown that helps its businesses flourish and many European officials feared that the very future of the Schengen area was under threat from coronavirus travel restrictions. These added to border pressures already caused by the arrival in Europe of well over 1 million migrants in 2015.“I personally believe that we will return to a full functioning of the Schengen area and freedom of movement of citizens no later than the end of the month of June,” European Union Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson said Friday after the video-conference meeting.All but essential travel into Europe from the outside is restricted until June 15, but many ministers suggested Friday that they want this deadline extended until early July.The meeting came as the Czech Republic was easing restrictions with some of its neighbours; Austria, Germany and Hungary. Also Friday, Switzerland said it plans to lift restrictions on travel from EU nations and Britain on June 15. Switzerland is not an EU member but is part of the Schengen travel zone.Johansson said Europe’s Centre for Disease Prevention and Control believes that confinement, social distancing and other health measures are working. More than 175,000 people have died in Europe’s coronavirus outbreak, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, mostly in Britain, Italy, France and Spain.“Physical distancing and other health-related measures are still needed, of course. But health authorities are clear that there is no longer a clear justification for either travel restrictions or border measures within the EU Schengen area,” Johansson said.German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, whose country plans to lift its remaining border checks on June 15 like many other EU countries, said “the internal border controls will be over in all of Europe at the end of June.” The news should come as a relief to millions of Europeans still trying to work out their summer vacation plans — which begin for many in July once the school year is over — and who are anxious to know whether they will be allowed to head to the continent’s beaches or mountains.It’s also good news for European countries whose economies have been ravaged by the spread of COVID-19 and are hoping for a much-needed boost from their decimated tourism industries.But the perception that Italy is still dangerous is weighing heavily on its tourism sector, which along with related industries accounts for 13% of Italy’s gross domestic product.In an apparent reference to Austria and Greece, which have not fully opened to Italian tourists, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denounced the “ad hoc” measures put in place by some countries as “a violation of the European spirit that has always distinguished us.” Di Maio said Rome would provide regular infection data to Austria “so they can have certainty about Italy’s numbers.” Last week, he said Italy refused to be treated as a leper after Greece announced a list of 29 countries whose citizens could visit without testing or quarantine requirements, but excluded Italians, Britons and residents of other hard-hit countries.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte have sent a joint letter to European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen urging “the lifting of restrictions at our internal borders (...) in a coordinated, non-discriminatory manner.” The letter was shared with media in Spain on Friday.The government leaders of the eurozone’s third- and fourth-largest economies want the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to play a leading role in “defining as soon as possible these criteria together with the member states.” Spain, which relies on tourism for 12% of its GDP, plans to wait until July 1 to drop its 14-day quarantine requirement for everyone who crosses its borders, Spaniards included.“Many of our member states are approaching the date when they are going to reopen their borders to tourist mobility,” Sánchez and Conte wrote. “How this process is carried out will largely determine our citizens’ perception of the centrality of the European Union in tackling this crisis.” Germany’s Seehofer said most of the EU’s interior ministers want to extend the current entry ban on outside travelers “by 14 days until July 1.” Visitors from the United States, Russia or Brazil, for example, would only be allowed back into Europe on based on how those nations have brought the spread of the virus under control, he said. Those three nations account for 44% of the world’s confirmed infections and nearly 38% of the world’s confirmed coronavirus deaths, according to Johns Hopkins. Worldwide, 6.6 million people have been confirmed infected by the virus and over 391,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins, but experts say the tally understates the true toll of the pandemic due to limited testing, missed mild cases and deliberate government undercounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-wants-borders-free-of-virus-restrictions-by-end-of-june/story-g8NsSqRMtq5o6YjHGWYrYN.html

It did not say who made the complaint.The Burbank, California lawyer who requested the takedown, Sam Koolaq, declined to identify his client or the copyright violation in the video. He said in an email that he also submitted takedown notices to YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.Facebook, which owns Instagram, took the video down later on Friday. “We received a copyright complaint from the creator under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and have removed the post,” Facebook said in a statement. YouTube did not respond to a request for comment.The three minute and 45 second clip is a montage of photos and videos of peaceful marches and police officers hugging protesters interspersed with some scenes of burning buildings and vandalism, set to gentle piano music and Trump speaking.Last month, Twitter placed fact-check warnings on two tweets from Trump’s own account that called mail-in ballots “fraudulent” and predicted problems with the November U.S. elections. Under the tweets, there is now a link reading “Get the facts about mail-in ballots” that guides users to a Twitter “moments” page with fact checks and news stories about Trump’s unsubstantiated claims.It also demoted and placed a stronger warning on a third Trump tweet about Minneapolis protests that read, in part, that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Twitter said that the tweet had violated the platform’s rules by glorifying violence.Trump responded by threatening to retaliate against social media companies.Last year, Twitter also removed a Trump tweet that featured a doctored Nickelback music video clip that took aim at former Vice President Joe Biden, after receiving copyright complaints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-disables-trump-campaign-s-george-floyd-video-tribute/story-Mdx3cu64FPycMLsJJveR5K.html

06-06-2020||India||Nisarga leaves trail of damage in Maharashtra||In Shahabaj village, 17km from Alibag, 28-year-old Ashwini Bhagat and her husband Tanmay are surveying the damage to the roof. Residents of Mumbai, the duo visited their village two months ago and were forced to stay back after the national lockdown was announced on March 25. Last week, a severe cyclonic storm made landfall around 100 km south of Alibag, an elite resort town and a fishing village in Maharashtra’s coastal district of Raigad. At least 500,000 homes, including the Bhagats’ village home, have been damaged by Nisarga in Raigad district alone though a red alert was sounded for seven Konkan districts as well as a few in northern Maharshtra, as well. At least 5000 hectares in Palghar, and 8000 hectares of agricultural cropland in Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Raigad and Nashik among other districts have been affected, including farms growing onions and grapes. “The roof of our house has been damaged and we have been living without electricity or water supply for four days now,” Bhagat said. They have been using the invertor for an hour daily, during which time all nine members of their family charge their phones. Water supply has been affected too, Bhagat added.“Officials are saying it will take minimum four days for power supply to be restored. We have been finding it very difficult,” Tanmay said.On Friday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray visited areas of Alibag and announced ₹100 crore for immediate relief work. The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) said that it is working on a war-footing to restore electricity. More than more than 200,000 trees and 15,000 poles have collapsed.The day before the cyclone was to make landfall, the state evacuated several thousand people from the coastline, including 13, 245 in Raigad and 15,080 in Palghar. So while the destruction to life has been minimal -- only six persons have died, and 16 injured across districts -- damage to mobile towers, trees and electricity has been tremendous.In Thal, 8km from Alibag, Mukund Sapre has lost an acre of his farm, completely destroying huge coconut trees, banana and betel nut plantations. “It’s a huge loss for us,” says his grandson, Tejas Vaidya, a resident of Chondhi village, 10km from Alibag.“My mother said that she has not seen something this bad in her life. We could see the trees moving in circles before they collapsed. It was scary,” said 29-year-old Jaydatta Nikalje, resident of Vaibhav Nagar in Alibag. The Nikalje family lost two mango trees and a jackfruit tree.Till Friday, the Nikalje family had lost power supply. “Parts of the town started getting supply only by Saturday morning. Connectivity is still an issue, especially because most of us are working from home owing to the lockdown,” said Nikalje, a digital marketing professional.The last severe cyclonic storm to hit close to Mumbai was in 1961.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nisarga-leaves-trail-of-damage-in-maha/story-tIlaDisMFRrDcgj1UY9B4H.html
06-06-2020||India||Heavy rain likely over central India||A low-pressure area is likely to develop over east-central Bay of Bengal around June 8 that weather scientists are hoping will not intensify into a cyclone, but become a monsoon depression that will bring widespread and very heavy rains to the region.Cyclone Amphan battered Odisha and West Bengal in the east on May 20, causing widespread damage, but the India Meteorological Department (IMD) doesn’s expect a cyclone this time, said scientist Sunitha Devi, in charge of cyclones at IMD. “ It will most likely be a monsoon depression or a low which will bring a lot of rain to central and east India including Odisha, Chhattisgarh and even Vidarbha. In some years such troughs form but not every year,” she said. Parts of Odisha, Chhattigarh and Vidarbha may receive extremely heavy rains (more than 20 cm a day), she said.Cyclones normally don’t develop during the south-west monsoon, which is characterized by strong westerly winds in the lower troposphere (below 5 km) and very strong easterly winds in the upper troposphere (above 9 km). This results in a large vertical wind shear, which inhibits cyclones, according to Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre for Tropical Cyclones. During the rainy season, low pressure systems form along the monsoon trough, which extends from northwest India to north Bay of Bengal. These systems have a short oceanic spell, which is also one of the reasons for inhibiting their development into cyclones.“Odisha, Andhra will get very heavy rainfall first and then other parts of central India starting June 10 for the next three to four days. Monsoon depressions can cause a lot of rain so it is good for our monsoon,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.To be sure, cyclone NIsarga hit Alibaug in Maharashtra’s Raigad last week, bringing heavy rainfall to many parts of the state. In Raigad, the storm snapped power cables, and uprooted trees and electric poles.“Monsoon doesn’t allow these systems to intensify though we had Nisarga in beginning of the monsoon season in the Arabian Sea, which is slightly unusual. All low-pressure systems in the Indian Ocean tend to move in west-northwest direction. They may or may not cross the coast,” said K Sathi Devi, head of the national weather forecasting centre.The new low pressure will develop immediately after remnants of Nisarga disintegrate. The low pressure area was over Bihar and adjoining northeast Uttar Pradesh on Saturday. The south-west monsoon has advanced into some more parts of south interior Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karaikal; most parts of south-west Bay of Bengal, the entire south-east Bay of Bengal; some more parts of east-central Bay of Bengal and some parts of west-central and north-east Bay of Bengal, according to IMD. Conditions are becoming favourable for further advancement of the monsoon during next 2-3 days.The monsoon is likely to cover most parts of Maharashtra; Odisha and peninsular India by June 10 and all of central India by June 20, Mohapatra said.The average annual frequency of tropical cyclones in the north Indian Ocean (Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea) is about five. The frequency is more in the Bay of Bengal than in the Arabian Sea, the ratio being 4:1. May-June and October-November are known to produce cyclones of severe intensity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-rain-likely-over-central-india/story-yMRUq8ZXK70J9enljla07I.html

This is Demon 2.0,” he tweeted, along with a news report on the impact of the pandemic on the economy and the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) sector. The opposition party has been demanding immediate cash assistance of Rs 10,000 to the poor and an economic stimulus package for the MSME industry to tide over the crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.Gandhi has also urged the government to make a monthly transfer Rs 7,500 to the poor and migrant workers for a period of six months.The Congress has argued that MSMEs contributed close to one third of the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP), accounted for almost 50% of exports and employed over 110 million people.Without appropriate support, over 6.3 crore MSME units stand on the verge of economic ruin, the opposition party has claimed.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, dismissed Gandhi’s charge.“For the first time despite being forced to stay in the country for so long, Gandhi has not found time to keep himself abreast with the announcements made by the government, especially related to the MSME sector, the poor and the marginalised as part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat,” BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-destroying-economy-by-refusing-aid-to-poor-rahul/story-FEnNyaJlC8wqr3h0y1Se4H.html

The BJP, given its strength in the assembly, can easily win two seats and would need 15 more votes in case of it deciding to field a third candidate.The meeting which took place at the state party headquarters in Malleshwaram was attended by state unit president Nalin Kumar Kateel, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, cabinet ministers Jagadish Shettar, C T Ravi, R Ashoka, K S Eshwarappa, Deputy CM Govind Karajola as well as senior leaders including C M Udasi. Union ministers D V Sadananda Gowda, Prahalad Joshi and general secretary in charge of the Karnataka unit Muralidhara Rao and D Purandareswari who is co-in-charge participated via a video conference.While the core committee is said to have discussed various names including those of media and transport baron Vijay Sankeshwar-- a former two-term Lok Sabha MP, Tejaswini - social activist and wife of former union minister and BJP stalwart Ananth Kumar, Sudha Murthy - philanthropist and wife of Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy, K V Kamath - former ICICI bank chief, Prof M Nagaraj - a Sangh ideologue from Northern Karnataka and a few others, it finally decided to recommend the names of Kore, Katti and Shetty for the party high command’s final consideration.Prabhakar Kore is an education baron who controls about 250 educational institutions in Karnataka and Maharashtra under the Karnataka Lingayat Education (KLE) society and is a current Rajya Sabha member whose term will end on June 25.The second name is that of Ramesh Katti, who is the brother of eight-term MLA Umesh Katti, a prominent BJP leader from Northern Karnataka. Ramesh Katti narrowly lost out the BJP Lok Sabha ticket from the Chikkodi parliamentary seat and the brothers have been pressurising CM Yediyurappa to keep what they say is his promise to send the younger Katti sibling to the upper house of parliament.The last name on the list is Prakash Shetty a hospitality and real estate entrepreneur who runs a chain of hotels. The BJP may decide to field a third candidate only if somebody like Shetty can ensure the additional 15 votes required to get elected. A member needs 44 votes to win. Sources in the party said that they had requested the high command to field only two candidates as they would be short of 15 votes for a third candidate. “Finally the high command will decide the names from the list recommended or decide to have its own names. Since Tuesday is the last day for nominations, we expect the names to be announced on Sunday. We have not decided what we would do with the additional votes,” said a senior leader of the party who didn’t want to be identified after the core committee meeting.Congress has already announced veteran party leader Mallikarjuna Kharge as its candidate, while JD(S) which has 34 MLAs and would require 10 additional votes to get its candidate elected says party supremo HD Deve Gowda is yet to take a call on contesting. The elections are scheduled for June 19 and the last day of nominations is June 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-bjp-suggests-3-names-to-party-high-command-for-2-rs-seats-it-can-win/story-ealmbnaHHz8LiwLNpgDOnN.html

06-06-2020||India||‘Actor in me is still unsatiated…’||After a series of stellar performances in his over a decade old career, actor Gautam Rode says the actor in him is still unsatiated. “As I was trying for a job in Mumbai for better living, I never knew I will become an actor someday. I bagged a few modelling assignments that brought me into the industry. After TV happened, I realised that I can actually switch to the character, I’m portraying in front of the camera, quite comfortably. Since I had no formal training, I learned the hard way so how can the actor in me get contented?” he said over the phone.Known for his titular roles in ‘Saraswatichandra’ and ‘Suryaputra Karn’, Gautam feels, “Whenever television has come with shows that are from a different league, audiences have always appreciated them. Like ‘Saraswatichandra’ was based on a Gujarati novel written in 80s and imagine the show went ahead and become a cult in 2013-14. And had a broadcast in 47 countries. So, it’s all about what goes down well with the audience else shows like ‘Mahakumbh- Ek Rahasaya’, ‘Ek Kahani’ or ‘Kaal Bhairav Rahasya Season 2’ wouldn’t have been so well appreciated as they were nowhere near the regular stuff happening on TV.”The suave actor has not only worked on diverse platforms including films but has experimented with different genres. “I am absolutely comfortable in all genres because at the end of the day, an artiste is expected to pull off every emotion convincingly. And then it’s my job and I am paid for it. As far as different platforms are concerned, I have also been fan of finite shows as they work on similar pattern like films where you know when the story will end.”Last seen playing a cameo in the ongoing show ‘Bhakharwadi,’ Gautam was about to make his OTT debut with a digital film. “Yes, it was all set and if this lockdown wouldn’t have happened, I would have completed the film by now. But due to this outbreak now it will now happen later. Though the good part is that state government has come with a set of guidelines for TV and web shoots to start in a few weeks. So, there is hope for all of us now to get back to work else we would just sit home mastering our household skills,’ said the ‘Aksar 2’ actor.Married to Lucknowite, actor Pankhuri Awasthy, Gautam wishes to come back to the city as soon as things get better. “I haven’t been to my in-laws place for long now. Also, Pankhuri to wants to visit Lucknow. So, we will plan something soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/actor-in-me-is-still-unsatiated/story-1amPVLHbfZsGwbvbIh0FYP.html

After independence, the Criminal Tribes Act was repealed in 1952 and the tribe was de-notified. However, cases of harassment of the Pardhi community at the hands of police and administration have often been reported over the last seven decades.The agency was asked by the Madhya Pradesh high court to probe the death of Indermal Bai, a resident of Pardhi mohalla in Gandhi Nagar (Bhopal), who had set herself on fire on November 17, 2017 in front of four police officers – Gajraj, Dheeraj, Sandeep and Rajeshwar Yadav.It was alleged that the police officers used to harass her regularly demanding Rs 20,000 bribe and threatened her that if she didn’t pay, she will be implicated in a false case. She had even filed a complaint before the Collector against the police officers but the harassment did not stop.On November 17, 2017, Indermal Bai was incited by the officers to commit suicide. She succumbed to her injuries three days later, but not before recording her dying declaration.The police, instead of taking action against the officers, claimed she caught fire by accident.In its order in November last year, Madhya Pradesh high court observed that why police personnel, if present at the spot during the incident, didn’t take any action to stop the deceased from immolating herself needs to be probed.The court also noted that the police didn’t conduct a forensic test on the clothes seized from the deceased and it failed to take into account statements of witnesses present there.CBI has filed the FIR on Friday naming all four police officers, who will be examined soon, an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-takes-over-probe-into-alleged-harassment-death-of-pardhi-tribe-woman-in-mp/story-YpU3iHn4RbaJbDthhudE5N.html

06-06-2020||India||Joe Biden clinches Democratic presidential nomination, secures 1,991 delegates||Former Vice-President Joe Biden on Friday secured enough delegates to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination at the party convention in Milwaukee slated for August this year.Late results from the June 2 primaries took the former Vice-President to 1995 delegates, taking him across the threshold of 1,991 needed to clinch the Democratic nomination (Republicans have a different count and threshold).“Folks, tonight we secured the 1,991 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination,” Biden wrote on twitter late Friday. “I’m going to spend every day fighting to earn your vote so that, together, we can win the battle for the soul of this nation.”“This is a difficult time in America’s history. And Donald Trump’s angry, divisive politics is no answer,” he went on to say in a statement. “The country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us. Leadership that can bring us together. We need an economy that works for everyone — now. We need jobs that bring dignity — now. We need equal justice — and equal opportunities — for every American now. We need a president who cares about helping us heal — now.”Biden has been the presumptive Democratic nominee for weeks now, after Senator Bernie Sander, the last of his rival, quit the race and endorsed him. He had secure enough delegates, however, to clinch it at the convention formally to take on President Donald Trump in November.Biden had fallen marginally short of the delegate threshold on the night of June 2 primaries in seven states and Washington DC. That deficit was met by late results that came in on Friday.Biden hit the campaign trail earlier this week after weeks of virtual town halls and meetings conducted from home in Delaware, forced by social distancing guidelines related to the Covid-19 epidemic. In a speech from Philadelphia, in a key swing state, he launched a scathing attack on Trump’s handling of the ongoing civil unrest against racial inequities.The former vice-president has been ahead of the Trump in head-to-head polls. They are currently running 49.3 to 42.2 in the RealClearPolitics average of all polls.The vice president had entered the Democratic race as frontrunner, with a claim on the legacy of President Barack Obama, who remains phenomenally popular among Democrats. He survived questions about his age and lack of enthusiasm and long enough to drag his floundering campaign to the South Carolina primaries.He grabbed the state with a resounding victory, with the support of African American Democrats, that put him on course to the nomination. As moderate Democrats rallied to his side, he went on to win 10 of the 14 states that held primaries on March 4, Super Tuesday, taking a lead that grew unassailable over the next days and weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/joe-biden-clinches-democratic-presidential-nomination-secures-1-991-delegates/story-MTY5Y7JWgSyX4dva4HppTM.html

Our employee has been calling us back since we returned around a month ago,” they said. Both of them work for a construction firm in Haryana.Similarly, Purnia residents and construction labourers, Muzaffar and Dilshad, too, left their native district on Friday, as their employer has promised to pay them between Rs 20,000 and Rs 30,000 a month. “Our employer has assured us that we would make one-and-a-half times more in a month than what we used to earn earlier,” they said.Previously, they used to earn between Rs 500 and Rs 700 daily for their work.Md Izharul (35), a resident Amour block in the district, had come back from Chandigarh by a Shramik Special train and is now all set to go back to his workplace. “I’ve completed my quarantine period. It’s high time to go back since the state government is not in a position to provide us with any kind of employment,” he said.So far, over 100 migrants from Purnia have left for Haryana by special buses, which were sent by big farmers and realtors.Purnia district magistrate Rahul Kumar said, “We’re generating employment at the local level in various forms. We’re also trying to convince the migrants to stay back, but we can’t compel them if they want to go back to their workplace.”Migrants are feeling reassured to go back, as they are now in direct contact with their employers and greedy middlemen cannot dupe them any longer.“The situation has changed for the better. The middleman can no longer give us a raw deal,” said Md Parwez, a Purnia resident.Md Tarique, a fellow labourer, agreed with Md Parwez. “We had to give up to Rs 300 daily to a middleman. Fortunately, we don’t need to part with that cash anymore and our entire daily earnings are coming to us,” Md Tarique said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-india-eases-lockdown-migrants-in-bihar-leave-state-in-search-of-work/story-pgGURDRbikuVd3TSngQI2J.html

The state’s worries aggravated further after some well-settled people in the Gulf also started returning to Kerala in panic.On Saturday, it reported the death of former Santosh Trophy player E Hamsakoya (61), and 108 fresh coronavirus cases. Hamsakoya, who came from Mumbai on May 21 with his family members died in Malappuram. Five of his family members are undergoing treatment at the medical college hospital in Manjeri, said district medical officer Dr K Sakeena.A veteran striker from Malabar he played for Maharashtra in the Santosh Trophy (1981-86) and was also in the national team for the Nehru Trophy. He also represented many soccer clubs including Mohun Bagan, Railways and Tata Sports. He started his soccer career during his school days and captained the Calicut University’s football team. Many former players like Victor Manjila and I M Vijayan condoled his death. Among the 108 fresh Covid-19 cases, 64 are foreign returnees, 34 came from other states and 10 got infected locally, said state health minister K K Shailaja adding 50 people recovered on Saturday. There are 1,029 active cases and 762 people have recovered and more than 1,80,000 people are under observation.The state was on the verge of flattening its coronavirus curve in May first week but the number of Covid-19 positive cases went up with the return of expatriates and people stranded in other states. The numbers are likely to go up further as one lakh people are expected from the Middle-East by June-end. With the large exodus from the Gulf, its remittances will be affected and it will aggravate the unemployment situation in the state, migration experts said.Earlier, the state had faced many charges that it was interested in keeping its record and going slow on evacuating stranded people. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedhran had crossed swords and blamed each other. As stranded expatriates’ woes took an emotional turn, both the state and the Centre blamed each other and some of the bereaved said they never expected such an end to their kin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-108-new-covid-19-cases-kerala-sees-spike-amid-large-influx-of-expatriates/story-A1a8ezpjoTe0AfOCtElMvK.html

On March 23, the Chinna Chowk police in Kadapa town arrested three persons and seized a pistol and cash worth Rs 3.50 lakh from them. During interrogation, they reportedly told the police that they had taken Rs 50 lakh as “supari” from Bhargav Ram for killing Subba Reddy, who was in Hyderabad.“The police said the money was handed over to them allegedly by the personal assistant of Akhila Priya. The police later arrested her PA as well,” Subba Reddy said.The TDP leader, once a close associate of Akhila’s father and former MLA Bhuma Nagi Reddy, said Akhila has been targeting him ever since her father died in 2018. Recounting the old association, Reddy said he had saved Akhila’s father from being attacked by his rivals with bombs. “Everybody knows what my political history is in Allagadda...I don’t understand why Akhila, who grew up like my daughter, wanted to eliminate me,” he said. The senior leader appealed to the TDP leadership to rethink Akhila’s role in the party. Akhila accused Subba Reddy of making baseless allegations and suspected it was being done at the behest of the YSR Congress Party. “The police have included my name and that of my husband as A-4 and A-5. Law will take its own course. Why should Subba Reddy jump to the conclusion that I had planned to eliminate him? Does it not amount to influencing the police investigation?” she asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tdp-leader-alleges-party-member-hired-assassins-to-kill-him/story-kJzCJc22kdAfB0PeabluSK.html

In a statement to the media, the Association of All Goa Muslim Jamaats has said that until June 30, they have requested all mosques not to open their doors to followers in view of the spike in cases of Covid-19 in the state. “In Goa since June 1, Covid-19 cases have been on the rise. We have touched almost 196 positive cases in the past one week and it’s an alarming spike in coronavirus cases. We the executive committee members of the Association of All Goa Muslim Jamaats have decided to delay the reopening of all mosques in the state,” Shaikh Basheer Ahmed, the president of the association, said. In a statement, the executive has requested committee members/heads of jamaats of mosques across Goa to implement the advisory which has been issued keeping in mind the rapid spread of Covid-19 cases in the state and to help stop potential community transmission.“Masjid committees are requested to adhere to our previous advisory guidelines issued by us with regard to offering regular five times namaaz from home including Jumma namaaz (Friday prayers). These guidelines shall be followed till the end of June,” he said. Church authorities too have declined to open churches for worship and prayers. “We would like to inform our priests and faithful that we are critically assessing the novel coronavirus-related fluid situation that has come upon our state and that, therefore, we are not in a position to declare our places of worship open from tomorrow, June 8,” Father Barry Cardozo a spokesperson for the Church, said. “When we eventually decide to open up, with prudence, vigilance and careful discernment, it will be in consonance with the state government’s SOPs, which we expect to receive by then,” he added. On Friday, Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said that while religious institutions would be allowed to reopen, only individuals would be allowed at a time. “No functions can be held in religious places. We have said that if temples, churches and mosques open, then groups of people coming and performing prayers or aarti will not be allowed, it should be limited to routine pooja for individuals or individuals taking darshan,” Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said.Several churches including the Archbishop of Goa have been streaming the religious services live for the benefit of their congregations.Despite the Central Government allowing for the reopening of religious places, several people have expressed apprehension that the reopening would make these places hotspots of community transmission of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-rising-covid-19-cases-goa-s-churches-mosques-will-not-reopen-on-june-8/story-0tFa2fnYBdHWsTQYOvn7BI.html

World Health Organisation suggests the drug may have some positive effects in the treatment of Covid-19,” Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope said according to ANI.Maharashtra which has been hit worst by Covid-19 in India, has recorded over 80,000 cases out of the country’s tally of over 2.36 lakh. The state has recorded almost 3,000 deaths.On Tuesday, Drug Controller General of India VG Somani approved the use of Gilead Sciences Inc’s Remdesivir drug to treat Covid-19 patients.“The DCGI gave an emergency use permission for remdesivir... and this was based on evidence that was provided by the company to support its use against Covid-19,” Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry, had said on Tuesday.Amid a global race to find a vaccine for coronavirus, American biopharmaceutical company Gilead has given voluntary license for production of Remdesivir to Indian pharmaceutical companies like Cipla, Jubilant Life Sciences, Hetero Drugs and Mylan under a royalty-free arrangement till an alternative drug is found or until the World Health Organization removes the designation of ‘Public Health Emergency of International Concern’ for the Covid-19 pandemic.Gilead Sciences Inc claimed this week that the third phase of its clinical trial in hospitalised patients with moderate Covid-19 pneumonia showed that a five-day treatment course of Remdesivir resulted in greater clinical improvement as compared to standard care alone.Remdesivir, an investigational antiviral therapy, has received Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) by USFDA to treat Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-banks-on-remdesivir-drug-to-fight-covid-19-will-buy-10k-vials/story-1O4LnWwwQXIoC3Cennk7QI.html

However, cops claimed that the accused in this case had been pinned down after he had unleashed physical assault on a police constable and even threatened to kill him, when questioned for violating public safety norms by not wearing a mask in a public place.The incident was reported from Jodhpur on Thursday afternoon, when a city police constable confronted one Mukesh Kumar Prajapat-- who reportedly has two cases of ‘voluntarily-causing-hurt’ against him—for not wearing a mask at a public place, risking contamination from coronavirus disease.For Coronavirus Live Updates“Prajapat was not wearing a mask in a public place which is against the order of the state government, therefore the constable clicked Prajaptat’s photo.

06-06-2020||India||In Arvind Kejriwal’s defence of new Covid-19 testing norms, a warning about system collapse||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday asked people in the national capital not to head to Covid-19 centres and hospitals to get themselves tested for the disease if they don’t have symptoms of the disease. The chief minister’s appeal comes days after the city government changed its testing strategy to severely restrict access to Covid-19 tests.Under the new guidelines, direct contacts of infected people that are asymptomatic will be tested only if they have comorbidities or are senior-citizens between Day 5 and Day 10 of coming in contact with a confirmed Covid-19 case. The co-morbidities listed in the order are diabetes, hypertension, and cancer. A senior citizen is one over the age of 60 years.Kejriwal followed up the change in policy with his appeal to people, underscoring that the Covid-19 testing system in the capital could get overwhelmed if everyone was tested.Delhi conducts the maximum Covid-19 tests among all states, the chief minister said. But it is a limited resource and was bound to fall short of the demand.If all asymptomatic people reach hospitals and testing centres to get themselves tested, “the system will collapse,” he said, adding that he did understand that people were scared of getting the disease.But Delhi has a population of 2 crore. If 10,000 people turn up everyday to get themselves tested, “our labs will fall short irrespective of the capacity that we may build”.“Please don’t get yourselves tested... Please do not insist,” he said, the appeal directed to people who do not have symptoms of the disease.Delhi’s restrictive testing policy has been faulted by doctors.“There is no other way to know how much of your population is currently infected. In fact, if possible, make it walk-in for it to be feasible and expand the list of those who need to get tested to even asymptomatic people as many of those returning positive are asymptomatic carriers,” said Dr Lalit Kant, infectious disease specialist told Hindustan Times on Friday.The new testing strategy is also a contrast to the city government 5T plan - testing, tracing, treatment, teamwork, and tracking - that was announced in April.Chief Minister Kejriwal had then argued for aggressive testing.“If you don’t test, you won’t be able to find out which houses have been affected. It will go on spreading. South Korea identified every single individual through large scale testing. We are now going to do mass testing like South Korea,” Kejriwal had said on April 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-arvind-kejriwal-s-defence-of-new-covid-19-testing-norms-a-warning-about-system-collapse/story-X1rVqumj5SAEtJQknlsfCL.html

The chief minister has, however, tested negative for Covid-19.”On June 1, Rawat and three cabinet ministers had decided to quarantine themselves despite the Dehradun district magistrate saying that all three were ‘low risk contacts’ and they just need to follow May 18 guidelines issued by the Centre.The three ministers, Madan Kaushik, Harak Singh Rawat and Subodh Uniyal subsequently underwent a health check-up on Monday and returned to work on Thursday.On May 18, the Union health ministry had issued guidelines on preventive measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 in workplace settings, including maintaining physical distancing of at least one meter, using masks, frequent hand washing, following respiratory etiquettes, self-monitoring, reporting any illness, whether in self or office staff.According to the DM’s letter, the CM and the ministers were low-risk contacts and they needed to follow the directions and protocol issued by the Union health ministry on May 18 regarding the workplace.The ministers said they did not go for testing because they were low-risk contacts.Kaushik said, “I had quarantined myself at home as per the norms, but did not go for testing as I was not suggested to do so after the district magistrate clarified that I was a low-risk contact. However, a complete health check-up was done by doctors from the district administration and my health status was monitored continuously before I returned to work.”Harak Singh Rawat, minister for forest and environment and Subodh Uniyal, minister for agriculture gave the same reasons for not undergoing Covid-19 test.“I was found to be a low-risk contact but as a precautionary measure I had quarantined myself. As we all know test kits are limited in number and I was not suggested for testing by health officials, hence I did not opt for testing. The testing kit that would have been used for me can actually be used for someone who needs it more,” Rawat told reporters on Friday.Uniyal said, “A team from the chief medical officer’s office had come for a thorough health check-up and they found that I am healthy. At the meeting, we had maintained proper distance from Maharaj and were found to be low-risk contacts hence I did not get a test done. I am constantly in touch with health officials and have not shown any symptoms so far.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cm-tests-negative-for-covid-19-3-other-ministers-opt-out/story-nxBhhoVl4lwGI3flXt4ifP.html
06-06-2020||India||‘Priyanka Twitter Vadra’: UP deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya’s swipe at Congress leader||Taking a swipe at Priyanka Gandhi’s political interventions, deputy chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Keshav Prasad Maurya said it was only social media which was projecting the Congress leader as a “prominent national leader”.“I do not take her seriously.... We have already named her ‘Priyanka Twitter Vadra’. She only tweets for 2-3 days and the media remains busy and social media shows her as a prominent national leader,” Maurya was quoted as saying by PTI.In the recent past the Congress leader, through her Twitter posts, has shone a light on the death of a farmer in Muzaffarnagar, the closing of a cycle factory in Ghaziabad, teachers’ appointment issue, among others. Stressing his point further, the deputy CM spotlighted that even though the Congress general secretary campaigned for her brother Rahul Gandhi in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, she could not ensure his victory. Rahul Gandhi lost the family bastion of Amethi to BJP’s Smriti Irani, who is now a union minister. “...But everyone knows when she came to Uttar Pradesh to campaign for the Congress in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections hoping that she would make her brother the prime minister, she could not even ensure his victory,” he told PTI.The Congress’ UP spokesperson advised the deputy CM, who also doubles up as a minister, to appraise the works done by his ministry. “The Gandhi family has sacrificed its members for the nation. Before making such remarks, he should get the potholed roads in the entire state repaired as he is in charge of the Public Works Department,” Ashok Singh, spokesperson of UP Congress, told PTI. Priyanka Gandhi had offered to run 1,000 buses to send migrants workers from UP home and had sought the state government’s permission for the same. The government accepted the proposal but then charged the Congress of not being serious about the issue. The Adityanath government accused the party of “forgery” and said the list of buses contained registration numbers of two-wheelers, cars and three-wheelers.The deputy chief minister said Priyanka Gandhi has been critical of policies of the Yogi Adityanath dispensation only because she looks at the BJP-ruled state “from a negative point of view”.Referring to her tweet on migrant labourers, Maurya told PTI, “Congress does not want to see (what is happening in) Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. It is suffering from ‘drishti dosh’ (vision disorder). Congress leaders, be it Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra or any other, should get their eyes tested properly.” Yesterday, speaking to HT, chief minister Yogi Adityanath called the Congress offer to ferry migrants home as “bhadda mazak (ugly joke)”. Priyanka Gandhi, time and again, has been highlighting the issues confronting the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-twitter-vadra-up-deputy-chief-minister-keshav-prasad-maurya-s-swipe-at-congress-leader/story-EmtO45BX6RkghDfAMffTBK.html

GCMMF Managing Director R S Sodhi said that Twitter blocked its handle @Amul_Coop after its advertising agency posted a cartoon featuring its mascot `Amul girl’ with the caption “Exit the Dragon?” on Thursday night.In the bottom right corner, the advertisement had the words “Amul Made in India”.The cartoon appeared to support the new policy of `Atmanirbhar Bharat’ enunciated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as a call for a boycott of Chinese products on Indian social media against the backdrop of a stand-off between the two countries in eastern Ladakh.Amul’s Twitter handle could be accessed when checked on Saturday afternoon and the post containing the cartoon was also visible. “We do not know why the account was blocked as we have not received any official statement from Twitter....Amul has not run any campaign against anybody,” Sodhi said.“Amul girl campaign is on since last 55 years, and our mascot generally talks about topical subjects, reflecting the mood of the nation in a funny way,” Sodhi said.“When our advertising agency shared this ad on the night of June 4, they learnt through a forward that our Twitter account was blocked. When we requested Twitter for re-activation, the account was restored,” he said.“When we learnt about this, we asked for clarification. We do not know why this disruption occurred. We have not yet received any official message from Twitter on this,” he said.Meanwhile, #Amul began to trend on Twitter with thousands of users coming out in the company’s support and accusing the microblogging platform of a bias against India. “Fantastic by @Amul_Coop. The dragon and their slaves got scared that they restricted the account. Imagine when our Army will be knocking Chinese doors,” said Twitter user Raj.“Shocking @Twitter briefly restricted Amul account because of the post calling to boycott Chinese products.

Even if we keep a two-meter distance between the pilgrims for darshan, we have estimated that in one day around 1,800 pilgrims can be allowed at Badrinath and around 800-900 pilgrims at the Kedarnath shrine,” said Raman.He added that a software has been developed for the pilgrims to register, following which they will be given a time slot for darshan at the temple.“If the temples are opened for pilgrims then each devotee will have a limited time to complete darshan and no prayers requiring sitting and performing rituals will be allowed, as it is time taking. People will be given time slots at specified dates to manage the pilgrims. At present, the yatra is likely start only for people from the state as those coming from outside will have to first undergo quarantine,” added Raman.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesDistrict administration officials have also started marking circles outside the Badrinath shrine for pilgrims to maintain physical distancing.Deepak Semwal, secretary of Gangotri Dham Committee said that priests and the traders’ body of Gangotri and Yamunotri shrines are not in favour of starting the Yatra at this moment.“No preparations have been done for starting the Yatra, be it opening of hotels or shops. The temple opened on the scheduled date and priests have been offering prayers but no other preparation has been done. If pilgrims come and they offer prayers, then we have to apply tika to them, give them the holy water, tie the holy thread on their wrists and all this is not possible if the priest has to maintain social distancing and follow the rituals too. It is not possible and that is why we request the state government to postpone the Yatra till the Covid-19 situation normalises,” said Semwal.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The priest body of Kedarnath shrine also wrote to the secretary, tourism and culture department on Friday, requesting not to start the Char Dham yatra as of now.Vinod Prasad Shukla, president of Tirth Purohit Samaj of Shri Kedarnath pointed out in the letter that the health infrastructure in the hilly and remote regions housing the shrines was not strong.“If cases increase in the remote areas because of pilgrims coming to these shrines, then it will be difficult to control the outbreak. Currently, even the locals find it difficult to reach the shrines due to the lack of preparations on the roads and given the sharp increase in Covid cases in the state. So, starting of Char Dham yatra in the near future should be reconsidered and deferred till the situation improves.”BD Singh, additional chief executive officer of the char dham board said while preparations are being made by the state government to restart yatra for pilgrims, nothing has been finalised yet.“We have not received any final update from the state government on starting Char Dham Yatra for this year. Preparations must be underway from the state government’s end, but nothing has been finalised yet. Till now, only online pujas with no attendees are being undertaken at all the four shrines and the offerings are being couriered to the devotees,” said Singh.Meanwhile, Madan Kaushik, state cabinet minister and government spokesperson said, “We are analysing the Centre’s SOPs on the opening of religious places and doing our homework. When we are assured of being in a position to follow the SOPs, we will gradually open the religious places.”Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had said on Wednesday that the state was considering restarting Char Dham Yatra in a limited, controlled and safe manner following the centre’s permission.The four Himalayan pilgrimage sites - Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath- collectively called Char Dham, are one of the most revered pilgrimage circuits in Uttarakhand.

The BJP stands by it. Nitishji will be our face and forthcoming elections will be contested on the policies and achievements of both Centre and the state,” said Yadav, passing the message to both party cadres and alliance partners that there should be no confusion on this count.ALSO WATCH | ‘Rajasthan govt took Rs 1 cr to send stranded students from Kota’: Sushil ModiShah had declared in late 2019 that Nitish Kumar will lead the alliance in the next assembly elections.The party cadres, grass root workers were all instructed to keep this fact in mind and work for the alliance in tandem.The BJP leader’s announcement comes at the backdrop of an interview given by the LJP president to a news agency in which he mooted the idea of backing the BJP, if it opts for a change of face in the Bihar assembly polls scheduled later this year.Paswan had recently expressed his dissatisfaction with the Bihar chief minister’s handling of the migrant crisis. He minced no words in saying that the crisis could have been handled better and there was “perceptible anger among migrant workers from Bihar who are stuck in far-off places.”“If they (BJP) want to go ahead with Nitish Kumar ji, we are with them, if they want to have a change of mind... whatever decision the BJP takes, we will support,” Paswan said in the interview.The Bihar BJP in-charge, Yadav, made it clear to all party cadres that they should not bother about who will be contesting how many seats. “Whatever seats one gets, NDA will fight unitedly. Prepare for all 243 seats,” he said and asked the party workers to treat June 7 virtual rally of Amit Shah as a ‘bugle’ for election.With the election likely to be technology-based, he advised the party workers to create a WhatsApp group for each assembly segment and add 75% of the voters in that particular segment who do not toe any party line. “In each assembly segment, there will be two virtual rallies will be organised,” Yadav added.Amit Shah is scheduled to address a virtually rally in Bihar on June 7. Yadav said that from June 11 onwards, a team of two comprising a party cadre and another party office-bearer will start distributing to each voter a folder containing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s letter to people and the centre’s achievement in every constituency. Party sources said that several such teams will be involved in each assembly segment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-snubs-ljp-reiterates-nitish-kumar-is-nda-s-face-for-bihar-elections/story-KjgHjj6ZcP1c1jtKxImh2O.html

This is ‘Demon 2.0,” tweeted the Congress leader.  Govt is actively destroying our economy by refusing to give cash support to people and MSMEs.This is Demon 2.0.https://t.co/mWs1e0g3upAlso Watch | Covid update: Trump on Covid, vaccine; Rahul Gandhi’s ‘failed lockdown’ jibe The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expects the Indian economy to contract in the current fiscal year. Growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019-20 hit a 11-year low of 4.2 per cent, the government announced in the last week of May. The economic growth slipped to 3.1 per cent in the January-March quarter of 2019-20 showing impact of the coronavirus.Services sector activity, which makes up more than half of the GDP, weathered a second month of brutal contraction in May as lockdown brought the economy to a near halt and left millions of people jobless. Activity picked up a shade in May with the services Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) reading at 12.6, slightly better than the record 5.4 low reported in April, but still well below the 50-mark that separates contraction from expansion, according to data released by IHS Markit.The HT report tagged by Rahul Gandhi looks at the economic situation before the pandemic and dwells on its nature and causes.The Congress has been arguing that money be directly given to the poor. They have been saying that Rs 7,500 must be immediately given to the poor and Rs 10,000 as one time first payment to tide over the economic woes. The country and economy are presently reeling under the effect of a long-drawn nationwide lockdown necessitated by the coronavirus pandemic.The Covid-19 pandemic did disrupt economic activity towards the end of the last quarter of 2019-20,notes the HT report. However, even earlier estimates had projected slower growth for the year than 2018-19. That India’s growth momentum slowed for three years without an external shock, raises doubts on the validity of claims of a cyclical slowdown, the report argues.The Indian economy was likely facing a demand-driven, perhaps even structural slowdown before the pandemic, the report contends. The policy response most likely misjudged it for a cyclical supply-side problem, it says. RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee pointed to weak demand as a problem in its resolutions last year. The only policy tool, the report argues, available to the committee, interest rate cuts, can do little to boost demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-is-demon-2-0-rahul-gandhi-launches-searing-attack-on-centre/story-cHydln6I9uN9EGYeYJx1BP.html

It has been three months without any salary. Now I do not have any money left,” he said.Another Kashmiri, who did not wish to be identified, said most of them have no sources of income and they depend on some well-to-do Kashmiri families there who are providing them food.“There are many medical emergencies including pregnant women. Many people have lost jobs, some have visit visas and we have no sources of survival left now,” he said, appealing for help.They said they have now arranged two chartered flights from Dubai to Srinagar and want the government to expedite the procedure for approving their landings at the airport here.“We have somehow managed, by pooling money, to arrange and then secure an approval for non-stop chartered flights to be operated by Fly Dubai on June 9 and 10. The dates are pending approval by the authorities in Dubai and Srinagar airports. All other formalities have been completed,” Aamir Rafiq, who is among those stranded in Dubai, claimed.Officials at the Srinagar airport also said the airport authorities have been approached regarding the chartered flights.However, a decision on them has to be taken by the ministries of external affairs, defence, civil aviation, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Airports Authority of India in consultation with the civil administration here, they said.“This is not something directly under the authority of Srinagar airport. For any international flight, the approval of the MEA is a must. Then, since this airport is a defence airfield, the approval of MoD (Ministry of Defence) is also required,” an official at the airport said.He said the permission of the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the DGCA is also required for such a flight to land at any airport in the country.“After securing the permission from these four, it goes to an apex team which includes AAI and Air Force for slot availability. Then, the civil administration is required to approve the flight landing because it is Covid time and it has to be checked whether they can handle the flight on a given day and time or not,” he said.The official said the Srinagar airport has no problem in permitting the flights to land once the required approvals are secured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/800-kashmiris-stranded-in-dubai-pool-money-to-arrange-2-spl-flights-urge-govt-to-expedite-approval/story-x6DdvCBTuNtk0L578cpkcK.html

With some of his comments seen to be critical of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led government, Paswan said he never doubted Kumar’s intentions but there have been “shortcomings” which he as an honest ally has highlighted. “Nitish ji emerged as an alternative to jungle raaj and was known as ‘vikas purush’. But, yes, there have been shortcomings. I am not levelling allegations but offering suggestions for improvement as an honest ally,” he told PTI. Paswan said the Bihar government’s handling of the migrant crisis, triggered by the nationwide lockdown to curb COVID-19, “could have been better” and counted law and order as a concern, saying serious crimes like murder and robbery have been rising. The Lok Sabha MP from Jamui in Bihar called for a common minimum programme to guide the NDA government in case it retains power. The assembly elections in Bihar are due in October-November. Employment, especially for its migrant population, health and education should be the top priorities for the NDA, Paswan said.Asserting that the opposition alliance, which includes the RJD and Congress, is not in a position to pose any serious challenge to the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, he said the saffron combine may win more than 225 of the state’s 243 assembly seats. When Kumar became the chief minister for the first time in 2005, he had said that he will work to bring back all migrants in three months and give them employment, Paswan noted, adding that a “golden opportunity” had arrived for the JD(U) president to “realise his dream” after all these years. From religious tourism to numerous paper and jute mills, which have been closed down over the years, Bihar offers tremendous employment opportunities, he said. Asked about the number of seats the LJP will contest in the state polls, he said that will be discussed in the seat-sharing talks among the BJP, JD(U) and the LJP. His party had contested 42 seats in the 2015 polls, and he would like the share to remain the same but much will depend on talks among the allies, he said. Kumar’s JD(U) was then part of the opposition alliance which had scored a big win in the last assembly elections. He joined the NDA in 2017.Paswan asserted that his party had strengthened its organisation in every assembly constituency of the state and has worked especially intensively in 119 seats which are represented by neither the JD(U) nor the BJP in the current assembly. With the coronavirus pandemic ruling out any big political gathering so far, he said campaigning through social media will play a big role in the electioneering for the state polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/job-for-migrants-should-be-nda-s-top-priority-in-bihar-chirag-paswan/story-IX58kOyEZO4kLSmJ5nrdeP.html

The longer route from Pahalgam will not be used for the pilgrimage which will now begin on July 21 and end on August 3.While Deputy Commissioner of Ganderbal, of which Baltal is a part, has already pressed men and machinery for clearing the tracks, officials of the Shri Amarnath Shrine Board (SASB) will start leaving Jammu on Monday for assisting in clearance of Baltal track and lay bailey bridges over streams.The decision to shorten the span of yatra was taken during a meeting held by Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor GC Murmu last week.“It will be regulated in view of the pandemic and all those undertaking the Yatra must possess Covid-19 negative certificates. The pilgrims will be cross-checked for Covid- 19 infection on entry into J&K before they are allowed to undertake the yatra,” said an official who did not wish to be named.All pilgrims except sadhus will have to register themselves online. “No pilgrims above 55 years of age will be allowed,” he said.“In a first of its kind SASB is also trying to telecast live ‘Aarti’ from the cave shrine in the morning and evening for the devotees,” he said.“Since it would be a curtailed yatra, the SASB is also mulling to allow it via helicopters only,” another official said.However, the lieutenant governor’s principal secretary and CEO of SASB, Bipul Pathak said, “Board is yet to meet and take a decision. When it is decided, media will come to know.”On Friday, the exercise for the yatra got underway with the ritualistic Pratham Puja.The government had decided in February this year to hold the annual pilgrimage to the holy cave shrine.The Amarnath yatra was originally scheduled to begin from the twin tracks of Pahalgam in Anantnag district and Baltal in Ganderbal district on June 23 and end on August 3 on the day of Shravan Purnima (Raksha Bandhan).Last year, the yatra was cut short following intelligence inputs of terror threats ahead of the Centre scrapping Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. In 2018, the pilgrimage was held for 60 days.Thousands of pilgrims either trek the traditional and longer 45-km long Pahalgam route or the shorter 14 km route through Baltal to the shrine every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-curtailed-amarnath-yatra-no-pilgrim-above-55-years-to-be-allowed/story-uRqBpfU86BHPDmnelQGBUO.html
06-06-2020||India||Indian and Chinese armies hold Lt-Gen-level talks amid Eastern Ladakh standoff||Indian and Chinese armies on Saturday held Lieutenant General-level talks in their first major attempt to resolve the month-long border standoff in eastern Ladakh, official sources said.The Indian delegation was led by Lt General Harinder Singh, the general officer commanding of Leh-based 14 Corps, while the Chinese side was headed by the Commander of the Tibet Military District, government sources said.The talks were held at the Border Personnel Meeting Point in Maldo on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh.Without specifically mentioning the talks, an Indian Army spokesperson said: “Indian and Chinese officials continue to remain engaged through the established military and diplomatic channels to address the current situation in the India-China border areas.” Saturday’s meeting took place after 12 rounds of talks between local commanders of the two armies and three rounds of discussions at the level of major general-rank officials could not produce any tangible outcome, the sources said.The high-level military dialogue took place a day after the two countries held diplomatic talks during which both sides agreed to handle their “differences” through peaceful discussions while respecting each other’s sensitivities and concerns.Earlier, sources had said the Indian delegation at the military talks will press for restoration of status quo ante in Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso and Gogra in eastern Ladakh, oppose huge build up of Chinese troops in the region and ask China not to resist development of infrastructure by India on its side of the de-facto border.After the standoff began early last month, Indian military leadership decided that Indian troops will adopt a firm approach in dealing with the aggressive posturing by the Chinese troops in all disputed areas of Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie.The Chinese army is learnt to have deployed around 2,500 troops in Pangong Tso and Galwan Valley besides gradually enhancing temporary infrastructure and weaponry.The sources said satellite images have captured significant ramping up of defence infrastructure by China on its side of the LAC, the de-facto border, including upgrading a military airbase around 180 km from the Pangong Tso area.The Chinese Army has been gradually ramping up its strategic reserves in its rear bases near the the LAC by rushing in artillery guns, infantry combat vehicles and heavy military equipment, they said.China has also enhanced its presence in certain areas along the LAC in Northern Sikkim and Uttarakhand following which India has also been increasing its presence by sending additional troops, they said.The trigger for the face-off was China’s stiff opposition to India laying a key road in the Finger area around the Pangong Tso Lake besides construction of another road connecting the Darbuk-Shayok-Daulat Beg Oldie road in Galwan Valley. The road in the Finger area in Pangong Tso is considered crucial for India to carry out patrol. India has already decided not to stall any border infrastructure projects in eastern Ladakh in view of Chinese protests.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-and-chinese-armies-hold-lt-gen-level-talks-amid-eastern-ladakh-standoff/story-92ybxQw3xEbTgnMc7KCVWL.html

Good-neighbourly relations have been China’s basic national policy over the past decades, and China firmly adheres to a peaceful resolution of border disputes. We have no reason to make India our enemy,” the editorial said on Friday.“But China will not give up any inch of territory. Once India makes a strategic misjudgment and nibbles away at China’s territory, China will never condone it. China is bound to make strong countermeasures. We believe India knows very well that China will not be at a disadvantage in any China-India military operations along the border area,” it said. Also Watch | ‘G7, China & Covid’: Key details of PM Modi’s phone call with Donald Trump The daily said India will enjoy a peaceful international environment with China-India cooperation.“But if the two countries face a showdown on the border issue, the entire Himalayan region and the Indian subcontinent will face instability. No external force can change this. Maintaining peace along border areas and friendly cooperation is in line with the two countries’ interests,” it added. India should not be fooled by the US, the editorial also said, as the US is only trying to “serve its own strategic interest”.“Washington is keen on placing a wedge between countries and drawing countries to its own side. But this serves the US’ strategic pressure on China, instead of other countries’ geopolitical interests,” it said.“Washington looks forward to the China-India dispute in order to gain from it. The US supports India every time China and India have conflicts to encourage New Delhi’s confrontation against Beijing and to hype new border disputes.”India, the editorial said, should return the favour “instead of being fooled by Washington”. “China’s strategic situation is not that terrible. Since we do not fear US suppression, how can we allow some force to use US support to make trouble for China?” it asked.Indian and Chinese troops have been engaged in a bitter face-off in several areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) following violent clashes between hundreds of Indian and Chinese troops in the Sikkim and Ladakh sectors last month. Army officers of the two sides have held several meetings along the disputed border but have been unable to break the impasse.Lieutenant Gen Harinder Singh, 14 Corps Commander, will represent the Indian delegation while Major General Liu Lin, who is the commander of South Xinjiang Military Region, and 10 other officers of the People’s Liberation Army, will represent China. The two sides on Friday agreed on not allowing their differences to escalate into disputes while respecting each other’s concerns ahead of crucial talks between Indian and Chinese army commanders.Naveen Srivastava, joint secretary (East Asia) of the external affairs ministry, held talks with Wu Jianghao, director general in China’s foreign ministry, through video conference and reviewed bilateral relations, including “current developments”, according to a readout from the Indian side.It was the first formal diplomatic meeting between the two sides since tensions flared along the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-mouthpiece-says-won-t-give-an-inch-warns-india-against-us-ahead-of-ladakh-talks/story-QRE8GBiJl8yIg88QDOahRM.html
06-06-2020||India||Odisha removes IAS officer from Covid-19 panel amid opposition allegations of irregularities||The Odisha government on Friday removed a senior Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer in charge of procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE), masks and testing kits for fighting the coronavirus pandemic from the purchase committee amid allegations of irregularities.The removal of Hemant Sharma, the principal secretary of the industries department, came as opposition Congress raised a stinker over the procurement strategy of the government asking how masks and testing kits were bought at different rates from different suppliers, raising questions about transparency.Sharma was given the charge procurement for Covid-19 in April as chief minister Naveen Patnaik asked his officials to be “prepared for the worst”. Sharma was among the key officials who led the emergency procurement team dealing with the purchase of PPEs, viral transport media, testing kits and other medical essentials required in the management of the disease.However, as opposition parties alleged irregularities in the purchase of these equipment, the government issued a notification saying Sharma has been rescinded from the duty. The government issued another notification later in the day relieving nine other IAS officers from Covid-19 duties, saying they have been spared to attend to their original administrative responsibilities.Congress leader Sudarshan Das said the Odisha State Medical Corporation had given a purchase order for triple-layer face masks to a Faridabad-based company on April 15 at Rs 9.90 per piece. However, the corporation placed another order on April 17 for the same quality of mask with a Tamil Nadu-based firm at Rs 16 per piece. While five lakh masks were ordered at Rs 9.90, around 30 lakh masks were ordered at Rs 16.Similarly, one lakh PPE kits at Rs 900 per unit were ordered from a company on April 17 with the incentive of 50% of the value if the kits were delivered within seven days of placing the order.Apart from this, the corporation had issued a purchase order for procuring 2 lakh testing kits from a Kolkata-based firm on April 21 at Rs 1,321 per kit. On May 7, an order was placed with Regional Medical Research Centre for procuring 45,000 kits at Rs 1125 per kit. On May 11, another purchase order was issued for 4920 kits at Rs 980 per kit was placed with a Bhubaneswar-based company. Das also alleged that while the cost of real-time PCR machine is Rs 4 to 5 lakh in the market, the same machine was procured by the Odisha government at Rs 12. 94 lakh.Neither Sharma nor officials of corporation replied to the allegations of the Congress leader.Sharma had said during a Covid-19 press briefing in April that the chief minister had allowed his officers to travel with blank cheques.“We all pray that the disease does not spread more in Odisha but in case it does, the CM has directed us to prepare for that scenario. The officers travelled with two cheques, one with the required amount written on it and another one a blank cheque, so that they can procure the gears for sure,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-removes-ias-officer-from-covid-19-panel-amid-opposition-allegations-of-irregularities/story-LvBoIl3CHVCm6fqjeBjwaJ.html

We provided people under quarantine with three meals. It’s June now and I have not got even a single penny as payment,” Rajesh Chandak, a hotelier, said.Hoteliers said they have to run from one office to another to submit bills.Owner of a resort, where the district administration put up doctors, said he was told that Sardar Patel Medical College (SPMC) will make the payment.“When I raised bills in the medical college name, it told me to submit bills to the Urban Improvement Trust (UIT), which acquired the property, and UIT redirected me to the district collector’s office,” he said requesting anonymity.Hoteliers said they had a meeting with the district collector over the payments on May 11 but they haven’t got any money yet.The state government allotted untied funds to district collectors in April for quarantine centre expenses. The state disaster management and relief department, which transferred the amount, fixed Rs 2,440 as the maximum amount for one person for a day at quarantine centres.According to the state-level quarantine management committee, there were more than 10,000 quarantine centres in the state and around 21,000 people in them. Gram panchayat buildings, hostels, schools and other such buildings have also been turned into quarantine centres.In Bikaner, the district administration acquired 12 private properties.District collector Kumar Pal Gautam said the tariff for quarantine centres in government or private buildings was decided by the committee with the consent of hotel owners.“The medical college will make payment to (quarantine) centres where doctors and medical staff were put up. We are examining all aspects to compensate the property owners,” Gautam said.Members of the Bikaner Hotel Association said it was facing rough time for the past year.“Business is down and we have to repay loans. When the administration acquired them to put people in quarantine, we thought we will make some money but the administration has not released payment yet,” Ranveer Singh Rathor, the association’s general secretary, said.The hotel owners also complained about the mess the guests created. Vikram Vijayvargiya, a resort owner, said guests tore bedsheets, broke washbasins and taps. He added that telephones installed in rooms are missing and they even threw mattresses in the swimming pool.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-620-a-day-for-rooms-in-rajasthan-resorts-doubling-up-as-quarantine-centres/story-v3IGU7eqZVJMDNU63gdVpM.html

06-06-2020||India||Scientists, conservationists urge Javadekar to reconsider forest felling for highway, railway expansion||A group of scientists, academicians, conservationists and concerned citizens from across the country, in an open appeal, have urged Union Minister of Forests and Environment Prakash Javadekar to reconsider the approvals granted to three projects that affect the Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife and the Mollem National Park in Goa. Goa is set to lose around 55,000 trees and 185 hectares of pristine Western Ghats forest cover for three projects - a highway, railway line double-tracking and a new power line. The Railway double tracking will itself take around 98 hectares or around half of the total land. In the letter to the Union Minister, the signatories - around 150 in number - warned that the projects, if allowed to go ahead, “are likely to lead to multiple downstream effects of fragmentation of these fragile ecosystems. The road and the railway track will create stark barriers that may lead to a rise in wild animal mortality. Movement of arboreal mammals, reptiles, fish and amphibians is likely to be hindered by these barriers.”Also read: Centre launches programme to increase forest cover in urban areas“The protected area is also home to more than 721 plant species, 235 bird species, 219 butterfly species, 80 odonate species, 70 mammal species, 75 ant species, 45 reptile species, 44 fish species, 43 fungi species, 27 amphibian species, 24 orchid species, and 18 species of lichens,” the letter reads. “Two dragonfly species which are endemic to the Western Ghats were described to science from here. In fact, the type locality of Idionyx gomantakensis is adjacent to the railway track which is proposed to be expanded. It has been recorded from few locations elsewhere in the Western Ghats and this is the only location in Goa where it has been known from, so far, close to the proposed railway tracks,” the letter adds. Also read: ‘Will leave no stone unturned to nab culprits’ - Javadekar on killing of pregnant elephant“If these projects are cleared, they will have severe repercussions on wildlife and for the livelihoods and ecological security of the people of Goa. Video-conferencing these decisions about forests that are important to us does not allow site-specific scrutiny to substantiate the facts, examine documents, or register the voices and opinions of stakeholders, in a fully democratic manner,” the letter stated. Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary and Mollem National Park are home to popular nature tourism spots such as Dudhsagar Falls, Tambdi Surla Falls, Devil’s Canyon and the 12th-century Tambdi Surla Temple, each with popular treks leading up to them. The group of signatories which includes scientists, naturalists, conservationists, artists, students and allied professionals have expressed their serious concerns regarding the virtual clearances granted to two projects passing through Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife sanctuary and Mollem National Park during the Covid-19 pandemic. The projects which are a long time in the planning were approved during the 57th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Board for Wildlife on April 20 held via videoconferencing due to the Covid-19 lockdown. “These forests that have existed for thousands of years are irreplaceable. Direct loss of biodiversity and the far-reaching impacts of habitat fragmentation will reduce ecosystem stability and decrease forest resilience that is also required to deal with the effects of climate change,” the letter reads. The three projects, some of which have been pending for clearance for more than two years owing to the want for clearance, will be fast-tracked now. The proposal for doubling of the existing railway line that runs between Castlerock in Karnataka and Margao in South Goa whilst running through the Western Ghats and past the scenic Dudhsagar waterfalls was earlier kept in abeyance and asked to be modified to suitably allow for properly designed underpasses and overpasses for wild animal crossing wherever required along the track.Since then, the South Western Railways, which operates the line has submitted an undertaking and has made provisions for eight underpasses for the crossing of wild animals in consultation with the forest department.The present proposal entails laying additional track to run parallel to the existing railway line including 12 tunnels with a 16 kilometre stretch through the wildlife sanctuary. Back in 2013, the Goa State Wildlife Board had rejected a proposal to construct a separate railway line through a different alignment, one which had an easier gradient but would involve a fresh disturbance in an entirely virgin area of forest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scientists-conservationists-urge-javadekar-to-reconsider-forest-felling-for-highway-railway-expansion/story-qtDKH5OCoLHNkNBx2o2EPP.html
06-06-2020||India||Double trouble: Is there a link between Covid-19 and dengue?||With the monsoon season setting in and the threat of viral, bacterial and vector-borne infections raising its ugly head, Mumbai has reported incidents wherein Covid-19 positive patients have also tested positive for dengue.A Lancet report published in March states that dengue and Covid-19 are difficult to distinguish because of their “shared clinical and laboratory features”.The report enumerated an example wherein two patients in Singapore with false-positive results from rapid serological testing for dengue were later confirmed to have severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection - the causative virus of Covid-19.The research further emphasised the possibility of serious health implications on failing to determine Covid-19 positive case because of a positive dengue rapid test result.Also read: 9,887 new Covid-19 cases in India in 24 hours, 294 deaths in highest single-day jump“Our cases highlight the importance of recognising false-positive dengue serology results (with different commercially available assays) in patients with Covid-19. We emphasise the urgent need for rapid, sensitive, and accessible diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, which need to be highly accurate to protect public health,” the report stated.Coronavirus cases across the globe are on a rapid rise with the tally now inching toward the 7 million mark. Nearly 4 lakh people have succumbed to death worldwide due to Covid-19 disease.

On Friday, India’s tally was 236,657.India is likely to hit the peak of infections sometime in June-July before the curve of daily new cases begins to fall.The number of fatalities has risen to 6,642, more than that of China’s which has recorded 4,638 deaths.Globally, 6.7 million people have contracted the respiratory disease and 394,887 have succumbed due to the illness, according to Johns Hopkins’ coronavirus tracker.India’s case fatality rate (CFR) or the proportion of deaths to the total number of cases has been steady at 2.8%, much lower than the global mortality rate of 5.8%, even as the number of cases has continued to see an upward trend.Follow live updates on Coronavirus outbreak hereAt an average, the country has reported 239 daily new deaths in the last seven days, 33% higher than the average of 179 of the week before that.According to experts, India has managed to slow the spread of infections with an early decision to enforce strict lockdowns, first imposed on March 25, but the number of infections is likely to continue rising as the government eases restrictions to help spur an ailing economy. The key, they say, is to control the case fatality rate, which will determine if the health infrastructure in the country is capable of withstanding the outbreak that has ravaged nations around the world.Some of the worst-hit countries and the current epicentres of the pandemic such as the US and Brazil have a mortality rate of 5.7% and 5.5%.Maharashtra has crossed the 80,000-mark and its death toll stands at 2,849, while Tamil Nadu has reported 28,694 Covid-19 cases and 232 fatalities. Delhi remains the third worst-hit area in the country with 26,334 infected people and 708 deaths. Gujarat comes next with 19,094 cases of the coronavirus disease and 1,190 deaths.Indian states worst hit by Covid-19—particularly Maharashtra, Delhi and Gujarat—are also the ones that have tested a higher number of samples than the national average and reported higher per-capita infections and deaths, according to an HT analysis of testing data for 10 states.Another worrying trend that has emerged from data shows that a majority of the 10 states has seen a rise in positivity rate (percentage of tests that are positive) in the past few weeks despite no major spike in their rates of testing.Delhi, which also has the highest testing numbers among the 10 states, has reported the highest number of cases and deaths per million population (1,262 and 33 respectively). Both figures are around seven times the national average of 360 and 3%, respectively. Maharashtra has also conducted 4,177 tests per million, significantly more than the national average of 3,291. Compared to the national average, it has 3.9 times the number of cases per million (637) and 4.7 times (22) the number of deaths per million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/9-887-new-covid-19-cases-in-india-in-24-hours-294-deaths-in-highest-single-day-jump/story-v5L5hhGI5Pf5Tj3goThmOJ.html

She said she would always remember how Yadav ran behind the moving train to provide milk to her hungry baby. “Humanity is still alive,” she said while speaking to HT.Hashmi said she had boarded a Shramik Special train along with her daughter, Saiyada, from Karnataka to Lucknow on May 31.She said Saiyada had been crying of hunger as the train covered about 1,000km and they could not find milk for her baby. Hashmi, who had been feeding the hungry Saiyada biscuits, asked for milk at Bhusawal railway station but in vain.As they reached Bhopal, she requested Yadav, who was deployed at the station, for milk for her baby. Yadav immediately went to buy the milk but the train started moving from the station.An emotional Hashmi said she cannot express her feelings in words when she saw Yadav running behind the train with a packet of milk in one hand and rifle in another. After running for a while, Yadav managed to handover the packet through the train’s window to Hashmi. The entire incident was recorded in a closed-circuit (CCTV) television camera installed at the station.Hashmi contacted Yadav at the Bhopal railway station after she reached home and thanked him for his humanitarian service.Yadav was also praised by Piyush Goyal, the railways minister, who said he “demonstrated an exemplary sense of duty when he ran behind a train to deliver milk for a 4-year-old child.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/humanity-is-still-alive-mother-thanks-cop-who-ran-behind-moving-train-to-give-milk-for-her-baby/story-VuwV0cPkDM9LxK81K5U5vO.html

06-06-2020||India||The case for widespread testing||The states that have been the worst hit by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) — particularly Delhi, Maharashtra and Gujarat — are also the ones that have tested higher than the national average and have reported higher per-capita infections and deaths, according to an HT analysis of testing data in the 10 worst-hit regions, highlighting the need for widespread testing.Another worrying trend emerges that a majority of these states have seen a rise in positivity rate (percentage of tests that are positive) in the past few weeks, despite no major spike in their rates of testing.Delhi, which has the highest testing numbers among the states here, has also reported the highest cases and deaths per million (1,262 and 33 respectively).

In Delhi, for instance, the positivity rate has tripled (from 6.5% to nearly 20%) in five weeks, while the average weekly tests have only grown 1.6 times in the same period.

06-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India recorded 9,962 new cases of the coronavirus disease on Thursday. It may or may not cross 10,000 cases on Friday (Editor’s note: it did not; India saw 9,398 new cases on Friday). With the numbers continuing to rise – the country has added roughly 50% of its cases in the past fortnight – it is time to revisit some questions.1. Is there community transmission?The ministry of health has continued to insist there isn’t, but with a total of 236,037 cases as of Friday, it is time to accept that in hot spots such as Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, there is community transmission. Studies in India have shown that around 28% of the people infected with the Sars-CoV-2 virus are asymptomatic. Globally, this proportion is around a third of the infected. Many others show mild symptoms and shrug it off. The positivity rate (positive tests to total number of tests) continues to rise or, at worst, stay the same in many states, especially those with a high caseload. We can continue to define community transmission restrictively, and insist that the pandemic has still not reached that stage in India, but it is perhaps time to accept the truth and move on. It is not going to change anything.2. Do we have enough hospital beds?This is a tricky question – simply because anecdotal evidence from two cities with a high caseload, Delhi and Mumbai, seems to suggest that we do not. Sure, on paper, there are enough hospital beds, but the honest way of framing this question would be whether everyone who is sick enough to be hospitalised (and who wants to be hospitalised) manages to get admitted to a hospital. The straight answer to that question would be: not always. Some do; others do, but after a long wait; and still others do not. India is not unique in this aspect. The health care systems of even the UK and the US were overwhelmed by Covid-19. And these were in better shape to begin with. May be states should declare more hospitals as dedicated Covid-19 facilities (as Delhi has done). And maybe they need to figure out a way of ensuring that high-risk patients (senior citizens and those with other ailments) get priority.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage3. Is it easy to get tested?The short answer to that would be: Ha!The long one would be that between restrictive and limiting guidelines, long waits, and delayed results, it isn’t. India hasn’t changed its testing protocol since the middle of May. It is perhaps time that it did, making it easier to get tested. Unless there is a problem of capacity when it comes to laboratories and testing kits – which the health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have repeatedly assured us is not the case. India’s health care system (especially its public health care system) has for long been characterised by selfless health care workers labouring to do their best with inadequate infrastructure. Decades of low public investment in health care cannot be wished away by a few weeks of planning and emergency spending. Ergo, difficulties experienced in getting tested or finding a hospital bed are understandable. What isn’t understandable is the refrain from governments that there is no problem either with testing or with hospital admissions. Reports, including some carried by Hindustan Times, clearly point to a gap between what governments say is available in terms of testing and hospital capacity and what people say they have access to. It is time to address this gap now – by using technology to allot testing slots and hospital beds, and by aggressively expanding capacity. There is a very good reason to: the trajectory of the pandemic in India shows that it is yet to hit its peak here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-GQ83cwV3WUcKKsM4WRCwBK.html

However, the discovery of 13 new infections from Bhubaneswar, including one from the city’s largest slum, added to the state’s worries.On Friday, 123 patients recovered from the coronavirus disease. The recovered include 35 from the virus epicentre Ganjam district and 22 from Cuttack. The total number of Covid-19 cases in the state surged to 2,608 with 130 new cases, including 22 in Khurda and Mayurbhanj districts each.The state lauded the health staff and volunteers for the spike in recoveries. “This has been possible due to the untiring efforts of all Covid hospitals, doctors, nurses, paramedics, ANMs, ASHAs, Anganwadi workers, teachers, Sarpanches and support staff including community health volunteers, as well as the police and administrative staff involved,” the health department said in a tweet.However, the celebration was short-lived as 13 new cases were reported from Bhubaneswar after a long time. Of these, seven were in home quarantine with travel history to Delhi, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and West Bengal while others were local contacts. One of the cases was reported from Salia Sahia, the biggest slum in Bhubaneswar with a population of over one lakh.Known as ‘Mini Odisha’ in Bhubaneswar for having people from all the districts of the state, Salia Sahi is a huge unauthorised slum that supplies most of the menial workers to apartments and commercial establishments such as hotel, restaurants and educational institutions. It has about 9,000 households staying in shanties spread over 250 acres of land.Officials said like Dharavi slum of Mumbai where cases spread like wildfire, the detection of the first case in Salia Sahi was an ominous sign. Bhubaneswar has over 450 slums of which more than 300 are unauthorised.In March and April, Bhubaneswar reported a high number of cases, however, the numbers went down following identification of containment zones and strict lockdown measures. The city has so far reported 81 cases and four deaths due to the Covid-19 infection. Since people began flouting social distancing norms after the lockdown restrictions were eased, the state government announced weekend shutdowns in Bhubaneswar and 11 other districts from June 6 onwards to contain the spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-covid-19-case-in-bhubaneswar-s-biggest-slum-worries-officials-in-odisha/story-opwlp1gO8PyLlv4AMM74KJ.html

The well located at Baghjan, operated by Oil India Limited (OIL), witnessed a blowout, uncontrolled release of natural gas or oil when pressure systems fail, on May 27. The natural gas and condensate matter kept flowing from it ‘uncontrollably’ for the tenth consecutive day on Friday. After failing to plug the flow, OIL had sought services of a Singapore-based firm. The team that was expected to arrive on Wednesday has not landed in Assam yet. “Singapore-based firm, Alert Disaster Control, will reach Duliajan (Assam) late evening on June 7. The delay in their arrival is due to COVID-related clearances at Singapore,” OIL said in a statement on Friday.In an email to OIL, the firm informed that the civil aviation authority of Singapore has issued a one-time ‘exceptional clearance’ for a charter aircraft from India to land and take off from Singapore on June 7.Meanwhile, OIL has decided to provide Rs 30,000 each to the nearly 2,000 families near the well who were evacuated and are staying at four relief camps since the blowout started.“Our families are spending time at relief camps since May 27. We hope that the experts reach the site soon and control the blowout so that we can resume our normal lives,” said Madhav Moran, a resident of Baghjan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-days-on-assam-gas-well-blowout-still-uncontrolled-singapore-experts-yet-to-reach/story-m2RsUcRNvBg1Ege1kzdIhP.html

He posted graphs purportedly demonstrating that some of the other worst-hit countries in the west had timed their lockdown and its easing, much better than India.There was a single line comment from Rahul accompanying the graphs, which said, “This is what a failed lockdown looks like.”Rahul’s tweet on Friday cited examples from Spain, Germany, Italy and UK to allege that India had mistimed lockdown and the easing of restrictions two months later. According to worldometers.com data, Spain currently has over 288,000 cases of coronavirus patients, UK has more than 283,000 cases, Italy has in excess of 234,000 cases and Germany has over 185,000 positive cases, compared to India’s 226,770 cases as per the data released by the health ministry on Friday. However, unlike India, the number of new cases in these countries appears to have slowed down considerably.According to the current data available on worldometres.com at Friday midnight India time, Spain, Italy and Germany had reported less than 1000 cases in 24 hours, while the UK had reported over 1,600 fresh cases. Health ministry’s Friday briefing put India’s new cases number at 9,851.This is not the first time that Rahul has questioned the efficacy of the lockdown, he had asked the central government to explain the roadmap ahead in a tweet on May 26 while claiming that it had failed its purpose.“The prime minister claimed two months ago while announcing the lockdown that India will defeat Corona in 21 days. More than 60 days have passed and the number of patients is increasing with each passing day. Lockdown has not been able to defeat this virus. I have a straight question from the government- What is the plan ahead,” he had tweeted.Union minister Prakash Javadekar had responded to Rahul’s claim the same day and said that he had given a wrong statement. “He gave a wrong statement, I want to tell him, when the lockdown was imposed the doubling rate of infection was three days; now the infection takes 13 days to double. This is India’s success and everyone’s success,” Javadekar said on May 26.The health ministry, too, had said recently that India’s place among the countries with most number of cases was not a fair criterion to judge the success of New Delhi’s containment efforts. He had cited India’s low mortality rate and infection rate in comparison with 14 worst affected countries with a combined population similar to India.BJP President JP Nadda, too, hit out at Rahul on May 30 and claimed that the Congress leader had a limited understanding of “these issues” and his statements were aimed at politicizing issues instead of addressing the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-is-what-a-failed-lockdown-looks-like-rahul-claims-india-mistimed-lockdown-cites-data/story-IR0NxIwYYrXGKfJvB6F7pN.html

The child is also suspected to have been beaten up by the accused.The Kerala State Women’s Commission has registered a case of rape. The woman told police that her husband had taken her and their two children to the beach in nearby Puthucurichy on Thursday. Then, they visited the house of one of his friends where she was forced to have alcohol and was sexually assaulted in front of her elder son.“The woman was rescued by a young man who found her in an inebriated state along the road.He drove her to her home and then informed police about the incident,” a police officer said.The man who reported the incident told some television channels that the woman was crying and had injuries on her face.A police officer from Kadinamkulam police station here said the arrests will be recorded after verification of facts.Police have recorded the statement of the woman, who was discharged after being admitted to a government hospital here. She told television channels that the men had inflicted burns on her body with cigarette butts and even slapped her multiple times. “Our preliminary investigation shows the husband was a party to the crime. He even forced her not to file a complaint. Some of the arrested men have a criminal past,” said Thiruvananthapuram rural police superintendent Ashok Kumar. He said the accused will also be charged under provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO). Police suspect that the men were part of a drug-peddling gang.

06-06-2020||India||Counterterror in focus as India prepares to occupy UNSC seat||India, which is set to be elected to a two-year term on the UN Security Council this month after a gap of almost a decade, said on Friday it will work at the world body for an effective response to global terrorism and reforming the multilateral system.External affairs ministry S Jaishankar outlined India’s priorities for its campaign to secure the non-permanent seat in the Security Council during the election scheduled for June 17.While working for inclusive solutions, he said, India’s key priorities at the Security Council will be an effective response to international terrorism, reformed multilateralism to reflect contemporary realities, a comprehensive approach to peace and security, a commitment to international law and streamlining of UN peacekeeping, and promoting technology with a human touch.Jaishankar said India’s approach will also be guided by the “five Ss” set out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi – samman (respect), samvad (dialogue), sahyog (cooperation) and shanti (peace) in order to create conditions for universal samriddhi (prosperity).He referred to the international context that the Security Council will face, including new and continuing traditional challenges to international peace and security.“Global institutions remain unreformed and under-representative. They are, therefore, less able to deliver. The Covid-19 pandemic and its grave economic repercussions will test the world like never before,” he said. “In this extraordinary situation, India can play a positive global role.”Jaishankar emphasised India’s long-standing role as a voice of moderation, an advocate of dialogue, and a votary of international law. He set out the country’s principled approach to international relations, which the foreign policy establishment will bring to Security Council once India is elected for a two-year term.“India will work constructively with partners to overcome old and new fault-lines and offer innovative and inclusive solutions, help developing countries obtain the necessary support to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic [and] help focus more on development support [and] greater involvement of women and youth in shaping a new paradigm…,” he said.Secretary (west) Vikas Swarup of the external affairs ministry said India’s candidature is set to succeed as it is the single endorsed candidate of the Asia-Pacific group. This would be India’s eighth term on the UN Security Council, and the two-year tenure will start in January 2021.In the past, India has been elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council during 1984-85, 1991-92 and 2011-12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/counterterror-in-focus-as-india-prepares-to-occupy-unsc-seat/story-y19wMjjCguo4DOS5497t2K.html
06-06-2020||India||Real time data on beds soon, says govt after complaints||Are Delhi and Mumbai running out of hospital beds for Covid-19 patients? The data shows they are not: Delhi has 4,606 beds available for Covid patients according to the Delhi government, and Mumbai, 3,289, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. And health care policy makers and administrators insist there is no lack of beds, or ICU bed/beds with ventilators (184 in Delhi and 64 in Mumbai). Yet, over the past few days, several people who have been unable to find beds or get treated in Delhi and Mumbai have taken to social media to express their frustration -- this, when government data shows there is no shortage. According to Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain, there is no shortage: “The truth is that there is absolutely no shortage of beds in Delhi at the moment. In the last three days, more than 1000 patients have been admitted to various hospitals in Delhi. If beds were not available, this would have not been possible. Even now we have close to 5000 vacant beds.”Jain added that the issue lies with the hospitals not updating data on the Delhi Corona mobile application, where the official figures are made available. “So clearly the issue is that some hospitals are not updating the data on Delhi Corona app on time or misrepresenting actual data when patients call. Patients were not getting data on hospitals before, which the Delhi corona app is trying to fix. We are making hospital bed data live and real time soon.”Still, on May 26, 47-year-old Jagdish Ujjainwala who was admitted to the hospital on May 21, died of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) because his family was told that there was no free ICU bed available to treat his fast-worsening condition. And on May 27, the government-run Lok Nayak Hospital, one of the Covid-19 designated hospitals in Delhi had 1386 vacant isolation beds and 64 vacant ventilator supported beds, according to the data made available by the state government in its mobile application, Delhi Corona. When asked about the number of available beds, the hospital’s acting medical director Dr PN Pandey said: “We have adequate ICU, ventilator, oxygen-supported beds available in the hospital. And, we do not refuse treatment to any patient in need of hospital care.” He added that he did not wish to comment on any particular person’s case. Ujjainwala’s case is not an exception. In Delhi and Mumbai, the incidence of people being turned away from hospitals or kept waiting for hours on end, on account of non-availability of beds, is on the rise. In Mumbai, the vacancies in the city’s 125 designated Covid-19 health centres and hospitals are even fewer. Of the total 1,097 ICU beds, 98% are occupied, according to data released by the municipal body on June 3; of the 442 ventilators, 85.5% are currently being used by the critically ill. On May 26, a 51-year-old physician from Cheetah Camp in Trombay, Mumbai, died of Covid-19 related complications after being taken to two hospitals, and finally admitted in a third, where he was forced to share a bed with another suspected Covid-19 patient for two days due to non-availability of beds. His teenage son, who accompanied him, said that patients were lying on the floor between beds in the casualty ward of the government-run Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital. He died within a day of being shifted into the Covid ward. In theory, everything is fine in Mumbai too. “If anyone calls at the helpline number— 1916, it gets connected with a doctor who asked for symptoms of the suspected patient. Depending on the condition of the person, they will be allotted with centres or hospitals for treatment,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner.Delhi has reported 1278 cases every day at an average in the last seven days; in the seven days before that the city reported 723 new cases at an average; Mumbai, meanwhile, has been consistently averaging over 1300 new cases a day in the past two weeks. This indicates that the strain on resources will certainly not abate in the coming weeks. On Friday night, Mumbai had 25768 active cases (46080 total cases) and Delhi 15,311 active cases (26,334 total cases). It is in this scenario that the Delhi government has tried to make resources available for those who are in actual need of them: on Friday, it directed five Covid-dedicated government hospitals to increase their bed capacity by 13,670, including 750 ventilators, in three weekly phases to be completed by June 25; earlier this week, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia announced that three more private hospitals would be converted into Covid-19 treatment facilities, and warned that hospitals with mixed use beds (20% reserved for Covid-19 positive patients) will be converted into dedicated facilities if they are found to be non-compliant. It also issued fresh orders to hospitals on Thursday to discharge mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 patients and said that designated facilities should turn away such patients.“In case the hospital refuses a bed to any patient in spite of beds being shown available, the government can and will take action. Some hospitals are refusing to take patients and the government will take strict action against them soon,” a media advisor to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said.Hospitalisation isn’t the only thing people are complaining about. There would appear to be a similar problem with testing. On Wednesday, the Delhi government modified the national testing guideline set by the Indian Council of Medical Research, to rule out testing of asymptomatic direct contacts positive cases, including close family members, unless they were above 60 years, or had conditions such as diabetes, heart or kidney disease. The following day it banned eight labs from carrying out tests on individual samples and pulled them up for not following protocol, and — according to the state health minister — for taking too long to report the results.“Some labs were giving reports very late. If someone has taken a test for the coronavirus, the reports should be ready in 24 hours. At times, some have not given results for 5-6 days. This leads to a delay in hospitalisation because the special corona facilities say they will accept only patients who have a positive test. Other hospitals refuse to admit unless someone is confirmed to be corona-free,” Jain told reporters on Thursday.However, experts said that by revoking permissions from these testing labs — another, Dr Lal’s Path Lab has been disallowed since a month — the testing capacity has come down by at least 8,000 tests a day. Thus as cases rise, this clampdown will result in people getting wait-listed for testing, delay results, and cause a great deal of trouble to those who need hospital admission for life-saving procedures, as no hospital admits a patient without a Covid-19 test.Kailash Chandra, a 43-year-old administrative worker in a private hospital, has been unable to get tested . He has had high fever for the past three days, along with a dry cough, body ache and chills and he fears they could well be symptoms of Covid-19, as he works in a hospital that treats Covid-19 patients. “My hospital has been barred from testing and I have been really struggling to look for a laboratory that can do the testing. Many of the labs said they are not doing the tests currently. Even though my doctor has put me on medicines to ease symptoms but I can feel my condition getting worse. I used to feel relieved thinking I worked for a hospital and could get tested without much effort, but here I am struggling to get the test done like many others,” he said. Several government helpline users lamented that calling on the number never led to a satisfactory resolution either.Experts said that a distinction needs to be made between those who test positive and those who wish to be admitted. Both the United States and the United Kingdom ask patients with mild symptoms to stay home, and only seek hospital admission if their conditions worsen, and the Delhi government too is hoping that residents here will exhibit similar restraint.In Thursday’s press conference, Jain said asymptomatic patients with no or very mild symptoms such as slight fever and mild cough can be treated and recover in home quarantine. “Patients with moderate (respiratory rate of more than 15 per minute and oxygen level below 94%) and severe symptoms (respiratory rate of more than 30 per minute and oxygen level below 90%) require hospitalisation,” he added.“Instead of limiting tests, we should widen testing to diagnose the asymptomatic and mild cases, so they can be self-isolate and not spread the disease to others. People will die of other diseases because of delayed testing. Limiting testing also leads to epidemics remaining undetected. If people are not tested, they may die of Covid-19 and we’ll never know. This is how pandemics begin,” said Dr Jacob John, former virology head, Christian Medical College, Vellore.“At this stage, we need more people coming forward to get tested and unless you make the process easily accessible, they will stay away from testing. Testing should be made walk-in, you shouldn’t need a doctor’s prescription or symptoms for testing at a private lab at this stage of transmission,” added Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology, Indian Council of Medical Research.“These eight labs were found to not be following the protocol prescribed by the ICMR. Therefore, action was initiated. As a temporary measure, these labs have been asked not to pick up individual samples. However, samples sent by various hospitals and other agencies will continue being processed in these labs. Every minute counts which is why Delhi government cannot compromise on any discrepancy which would consequently distort the facts in the daily health bulletin,” the Delhi CM’s media advisor said.In Mumbai too, the situation is not much better for persons seeking a test. The city, which has a testing capacity of 7,000 a day, tests only 4,000 samples daily. Further, a significant portion of Mumbaikars have been left out of the testing net; until June 3, only 1.7% of the city’s population has been tested. The state follows the ICMR guidelines of testing: symptomatic patients with international travel history; frontline medical or support staff are allowed immediate tests; asymptomatic but high-risk contacts of infected patients can be tested only after five days of getting exposed, among others. However, these in itself, aren’t enough categories. Mumbai’s Sir JJ Hospital lab has an installed capacity of 2,000 tests per day, but it only tests half of that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/real-time-data-on-beds-soon-says-govt-after-complaints/story-ujF25A4oEbBJOpkC0IkAQM.html
06-06-2020||India||Religious places get ready; Tirumala to open on June 11||The temple of Lord Venkateswara in Andhra Pradesh’s Tirumala will open for pilgrims from June 11 with stringent restrictions even as Odisha announced on Friday it will not allow religious sites till the end of June.While the Jammu and Kashmir administration is expected take a call on the opening of the Vaishno Devi shrine on Saturday, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said over five people will not be allowed inside a religious place at one point of time when they open on Monday.The Union home ministry has allowed the opening of religious places from June 8, though states can take their own calls depending on the ground situation. For example, officials in Delhi and Mumbai have decided not to open places of worship for now. Jharkhand has taken a similar stand.The Union ministry of health and family welfare has issued a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs), prohibiting choirs and singing groups, touching holy books and idols, and distributing prasad and sprinkling of holy water, among other safety steps.A day after the central SOPs, officials announced the famed Tirumala temple in Andhra will be open between 6.30am and 7.30pm from Thursday. About 6,000 people will be allowed to visit every day, one-tenth of the footfall before the temple was closed on March 19.“No darshan will be allowed for elderly people above 65 years and children below 10 years. Similarly, people coming from containment zones are also barred from entering the temple, and their credentials will be verified at Alipiri (in the foothills of the Tirumala),” Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) trust board chairman YV Subba Reddy said. The temple management will release 3,000 entry tokens a day. Another 3,000 offline tickets will be issued at the counters in Alipiri. Online tickets for June will be released on June 8.There will be frequent sanitisation of the temple premises, and devotees will have to undergo thermal screening. Wearing of face masks and maintaining six feet distance between two persons are mandatory.“Devotees will not be allowed to take bath in Srivari Pushkarini (the holy water body in the temple)...,” Reddy said. He said just two persons will be allowed to stay in a room in TTD’s guest houses. The stay cannot extend beyond a day. An official in the Jammu and Kashmir administration said lieutenant governor GC Murmu will hold a meeting on Saturday to take a call on the resumption of pilgrimage to the Vaishno Devi shrine. “Sanitisation drives are being conducted...However, final call on resumption of the yatra may take a day or two,” said the official who did not want to be named.In Kerala, chief minister Pinaryi Vijayan issued guidelines for opening of all religious places from June 9. In the famous Sabarimala temple and other religious places, entry will be allowed only after prior registration, and prasad will be distributed. Only online offering is allowed while community feasting is banned in and around religious places, according to the state’s guidelines.The Bihar government announced that religious places such as Mahavir temple, Harmandir Sahib Gurudwara and other shrines in capital Patna will reopen on June 8. The Mahavir temple will open from 6am-9pm, and devotees will be allowed entry on the basis of their name in an alphabetical order. Mahendrapal Singh Dhillon, the Harmandir Sahib Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee chairman, said: “Strict adherence to the social distancing norms will be maintained at the Gurudwara entrance and also on its premises.”In Punjab’s Golden temple, authorities instructed the cleaning and sanitization of the premises. Devotees will be allowed only from a few gates and volunteers will ensure proper social distancing at the time of langar and darshan.All religious places in Odisha will be closed till June 30, according to the latest guidelines by the government. However, Snana Purnima, an important ritual preceding the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath slated for June 23, was held on Friday without devotees. Eight hundred priests took part in the ritual, which was televised.(with inputs from states)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/religious-places-get-ready-tirumala-to-open-on-june-11/story-wzvJcxuzZIHsOrXPNy10cJ.html
06-06-2020||India||Centre ordinances give shield to farmers, aim to boost trade||A commercial buyer of farm produce will only need a permanent account number or PAN and no licence or other documentation to enter into a transaction, while a farmer’s land cannot be taken as a collateral or confiscated for violation of a farming contract, key provisions of the two draft ordinances announced by the Cabinet on June 4 show. The Union Cabinet had announced far-reaching steps to unshackle the country’s farm sector, approving amendments to the six-decade-old Essential Commodities Act and pushing two ordinances, one aimed at freeing up farm trade from all restrictions and the other guaranteeing a legal framework for purchases at pre-agreed prices to farmers.According to the ordinances, a buyer will have to pay a farmer within three days and in the meantime give the farmer a revenue stamped money receipt. A farmer can directly approach district-level magistrate in case of dispute with a buyer. Such transaction will not be subject to any taxes at the point of sale, the draft provisions show. The Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020 will effectively bring the curtains down on the decades-old agricultural produce market committees regulations (APMC) system that regulates buying and selling of farm produce. An ordinance is a law promulgated when Parliament is not in session.APMC regulations require farmers to only sell to licensed middlemen in notified markets, usually in the same area where farmers reside, rather than in an open market, scuttling price discovery.Ushered in during the 1960s, APMC regulations were meant to protect farmers from distress selling. Over time, these have often facilitated the creation of cartels and monopolies, evidence suggests. In December 2010, when onion prices peaked, a probe by the country’s statutory anti-monopoly body, the Competition Commission of India, revealed that one firm accounted for nearly a fifth of the total onion trade for that month at Lasalgoan APMC, Asia’s largest onion market in Maharashtra’s Nashik.These reforms in “agricultural marketing” have been a long time in the making and various government panels and economists have often argued for changing existing structures of agricultural trade.Draft provisions of The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020, which will usher new rules for contract farming and futures trading, show that farm land cannot be taken as collateral or confiscated by the sponsor of contract farming. If market prices of crops at the time of actual transaction is higher than what was agreed upon by farmer and buyer of farm produce, the farmer will get a share in higher prices too.“The ordinance will empower farmers for engaging with processors, aggregators, large retailers, exporters etc., on a level playing field without any fear of exploitation,” a Cabinet note said.The ordinance is the first Indian law to shift the risk of farming from farmers to large buyers and aggregators by potentially ushering a legal framework where contract farming will be undertaken as pre-assured prices. This will protect farmers from price crashes.According to NR Bhanumurthy, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, New Delhi, there could be initial hiccups in implementation of the law as it seeks to move all risks to the sponsor of contract farming with none on the farmer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-ordinances-give-shield-to-farmers-aim-to-boost-trade/story-WWx6oewVqOY3z3YqJfueeO.html
06-06-2020||India||SC seeks replies on pleas to reduce hospital charges||The Supreme Court on Friday heard two petitions on capping the cost of treatment of Covid-19 in private hospitals. It asked the Centre and private hospitals to respond, and also suggested that hospitals run by charitable trusts on land provided by the government at nominal rates be asked to provide such treatment at prices fixed under the government’s Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme. The first petition it heard was a public interest case filed by petitioner Avishek Goenka, who requested the court to fix a cap or a ceiling on the amount to be charged by private hospitals for treating Covid-19 patients. The petitioner argued: “The fee charged by private hospitals is so exorbitant that the quantum becomes a deterrent for patients to avail treatment.” The bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, M R Shah and V Ramasubramanian, which conducted the hearing through videoconferencing, issued notice to the Centre. In its order it noted the demand of the petitioner to frame a scheme for checking unregulated treatment cost for Covid-19 patients in private hospitals. The matter was posted for hearing next week.The bench was oblivious to the fact that a similar matter was already pending consideration with another bench of the top court headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde. Incidentally, this matter too came up for hearing minutes later.This was a petition filed by an advocate Sachin Jain seeking a cap on the cost of Covid treatment by private hospitals. He argued that private charitable hospitals which received land at concessional rates or free are obliged to serve the citizens and not make profit at a time of crisis. Jain filed a subsequent application asking the court to consider directing private hospitals to charge Covid patients as per the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme. He said that under the scheme the treatment cost is around Rs 4,000 per day.The bench of CJI Bobde, AS Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy asked Centre to explore this suggestion. Its earlier suggestion on providing free treatment in private hospitals was turned down by the Centre. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the court that private hospitals are governed by the Clinical Establishments Act, 2010 which does not permit the Centre to make such a direction. Commenting on the applicability of Ayushman Bharat, Mehta said the scheme had identified categories of beneficiaries and will not apply to all individuals.The bench said, “We are talking of charitable hospitals who took big pieces of land from government to establish hospitals and are making profits. Why can’t they be asked to provide treatment at this tariff (of Ayushman Bharat)?”Private hospitals represented by senior advocates Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi informed the bench that hospitals which took land on concessional rates are already providing 25% free beds as per agreed terms. Salve added that in these times, earnings of private hospitals are down by 60-70 %. The court fixed the matter for hearing after two weeks to receive responses from the Centre and the united front of private hospitals. It also allowed NGOs Drug Action Network and Jan Swasthya Abhiyan to give their suggestions in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-replies-on-pleas-to-reduce-hospital-charges/story-OeVXbixU3bkht8HDTHiEUP.html
06-06-2020||India||In Bihar, construction workers form bulk of returnees||Workers engaged in construction, including masons, painters and temporary help, make up the bulk of returnees who have reached Bihar in the aftermath of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and the ensuing lockdown, according to a first-of-its-kind skill mapping exercise conducted by the state government.The first round of the exercise covered over 1.2 million workers in quarantine centres . According to the state government, 1.2 million workers arrived on trains and 1.1 million travelled by road to reach Bihar in the aftermath of the national lockdown imposed on March 25 .Based on the results of the skill mapping exercise, the state government will reach out to industrial houses to invest in the state and create employment, a senior government official said on condition of anonymity.Finding work for the returning migrants, most of whom are unskilled or semi-skilled, has emerged as a challenge for the Bihar government, a coalition between the Janata Dal (United) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which faces assembly elections later this year.“Welfare of people is the basic premise of governance in India. States must take care of migrants at this time of distress and must ensure jobs for them,” said Ajay Kumar, an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University.. “The intent is appropriate, but there are several questions with regard to its implementation – do they have proper data and resources?” Chief minister Nitish Kumar, who faced criticism for seeking the Centre’s guidelines before making arrangements to bring back Bihar’s workers from other states, has been quick to announce that the government will draft a policy on providing jobs to the returnees.According to the skill mapping data, around 730,000 returnees were engaged in various construction jobs. About 4,000 workers have experience in the information technology (IT) sector, about 9,700 in e-commerce, and 7,300 in banking, financial services and insurance. There are over 14,000 professionals from the health care sector such as nurses, lab technicians, paramedics and fitness trainers. Nearly 20,000 were engaged in electronic and electrical repairs. State minister of water resources Sanjay Jha said his department alone offered over 600,000 jobs since the lockdown began in March.“The CM has interacted with returnees at quarantine centres, he has assured them that he will create opportunities for them to stay back,” Jha said.The senior official cited above said Bihar has a shortfall of workers although its people have found jobs in so many other states.“There are many opportunities for labourers in Bihar, but for various reasons including social practices, they prefer to work outside the state if they are engaged in blue collar jobs or as daily wagers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bihar-construction-workers-form-bulk-of-returnees/story-IzzgFXOFY4pL3rCacOxSRO.html
06-06-2020||India||Govt weighs new employment options for migrant returnees||With millions of migrant workers having returned home to the countryside in the midst of the lockdown imposed to slow the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) ,the Narendra Modi government is weighing multiple options --- from road construction to horticulture -- to find them work. It’s also planning an initiative to upgrade their skills to suit the needs of a post-Covid-19 world.The employment generation and skills upgrading programme, which includes district-wise mapping of the workers and identifying their skill sets, is being designed by the Prime Minister’s Office with the help of the rural development, agriculture, animal husbandry, skill development and road transport ministries.Construction work, officials said, hold the key to the targeted programme; an initial assessment shows that most of the migrant workers who returned to their home states after the lockdown took effect on March 25 were employed in the construction sector.Millions of unskilled and semi-skilled workers and daily-wage earners have left cities and returned to the hinterland by trains and buses, and packed in trucks, in the past two months after losing their livelihoods because of the lockdown that shut many factories and commercial establishments. The workers mainly belong to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal. To be sure, anecdotal evidence suggests that some workers are also starting to head back to the cities as the lockdown is gradually eased. A senior official involved in planning the initiative said schemes such as the job guarantee programme, rural housing for the poor and village road construction will be used to provide immediate jobs to the returnees. “Apart from these schemes, we are also looking at supporting them in horticulture, animal husbandry and road construction works,” said the official, who didn’t want to be named.According to officials with direct knowledge of the plan, the programme will start in June and go on for at least for four months. The initiative will not entail any additional financial support from the exchequer, the officials explained. Existing centrally sponsored and central sector schemes will be used to address a situation they described as extraordinary.Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are one of the major employers in manufacturing, but are unlikely to be tapped for absorbing migrant workers as the sector itself is going through a difficult phase and forced to work on shoestring budgets and with minimum workers. “MSME units wouldn’t be able to absorb tens and thousands of workers,” said a second official.Preparing the ground for the plan, the government machinery has already started mapping districts that have received 25,000 or more migrant workers, the officials said. Areas with a higher concentration of migrants would see an early roll-out of the plan.Keeping in mind the fact that job supply may not match demand, the government is also preparing to unveil the skill development initiative to train workers who don’t find immediate employment.Under the Centre’s Skill India programme, the skill development ministry has launched a programme under which unskilled workers can take crash courses and be paid a stipend over its duration. Many MGNREGS workers have taken advantage of this scheme to be trained in construction in the past few months.Although the Centre wants to see a large section of migrant workers engaged in road construction jobs, policymakers are also conscious of the fact that once the south-west monsoon gains momentum this month and arrives in northern India in July, the pace of the construction works will slow.“We have to design a multi-pronged approach to help our migrant workforce. And there would be many challenges,” the second official cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-weighs-new-employment-options-for-migrant-returnees/story-ycRAURz1cqvwNyvxLBcZbJ.html

A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, however, is yet to issue any order to this effect. NHRC’s plea was among the 14 applications for intervention taken up by the court. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta representing the Centre has supported NHRC’s intervention than the others.Laying stress on quarantine and relief measures, the human rights body recommended collection of data of migrants at the point of departure and arrival. It also demanded a journey allowance to be paid as mandated under the Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act, 1979. NHRC further recommended menstrual hygiene kit to be provided to each migrant woman and adolescent girl who are travelling. In addition, it sought shelter homes to accommodate special needs of lactating mothers, pregnant women, children and elderly.In a bid to provide employment opportunities to the returnees, NHRC also suggested skill mapping of labour. To ensure medical facilities, the short-term suggestions included regular health check-ups along with food and water during and after their journey. It also asked that a helpdesk or helpline be set up to support migrant and destitute workers receive compensation, avoid delay in Shramik Special trains, and create a fund to disburse fixed compensation to migrants returning home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrc-seeks-sc-intervention-on-migrant-crisis-lists-10-measures/story-gzFoNgszDsYcfL8xzeOJiM.html
06-06-2020||India||All states must create jobs for migrants: Supreme Court||With almost 90% of migrant workers having returned to their hometowns or villages after the lockdown enforced for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on March 25, the Supreme Court on Friday set out on its next task of asking states to prepare a roadmap for providing jobs to the returnees.Reserving its order until Tuesday on the transport of stranded migrant workers, a bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, SK Kaul and MR Shah broadly indicated that its order will require states to inform the apex court, which has taken suo moto cognisance of the matter, about schemes for providing employment to migrant workers who have returned to their home towns.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta informed the Court that around 10 million migrant workers had been transported to their destinations in 4,228 Shramik Special trains between May 1 and June 3. On the deaths of some workers aboard the trains, Mehta informed the court that Indian Railways, in its investigations, had found that these deaths occurred because of comorbidities and not for lack of water, food or medical care.The maximum number of trains ended up in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and some 171 trains are scheduled to run in the coming days to transport the remaining migrant workers who remain stranded. Mehta said 90% of migrant workers had returned to their destinations and based on demand from the states, trains will be provided within a short notice period of 24 hours.The bench indicated that it would not prolong the issue concerning transportation and would be fixing a deadline of 15 days for states to inform it of the number of workers who are still stranded and the trains required for their travel back home. The court heard the states make their submissions on whether they had prepared a list of migrants who had returned and the measures being undertaken to provide them employment opportunities.“We propose that all states should put on record what scheme they have prepared for providing employment to these workers who have come. We would also like a district-wise or village-wise data on who has come in and from where.” The Court proposes to include this in its June 9 order.Bihar was the only state which had done something on the matter. Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, appearing for the state, informed the court that in all, 2.8 million migrants had returned and no more are stranded in any states. The state has undertaken skill mapping of those workers who returned and have so far covered 1 million people. A process to provide them skilled or unskilled work has started.Uttar Pradesh, which received 2.17 million migrant workers through 1,664 Shramik trains, claimed that the state had not charged the workers for their travel expenses and food. The court told UP that now that the workers had returned to their villages, counselling centres could be opened at district or block levels to provide information to workers who wished to return to their workplaces. Kerala was the only state which informed the court of its inability to pay for the fare of migrant workers. But the bench directed the state to make the payment.Delhi claimed that about 300,000 migrants had exited the capital while close to 200,000 still remain. Most among them do not plan to return, said additional solicitor general (ASG) Sanjay Jain, appearing for Delhi. Maharashtra informed the court that 1.1 million migrant workers had left the state and some 38,000 remain. West Bengal stated before the court that it does not have data on migrant workers who intend to reach the state. Citing a rough estimate, the state counsel informed the bench that roughly 600,000 persons are still to return.Solicitor general Mehta informed the court that West Bengal had requested 17 trains and Maharashtra has indicated demand for one train Mehta told the court that the present system of registration, transportation and quarantine system for migrant workers should be continued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-states-must-create-jobs-for-migrants-sc/story-uOdtK9sAtBsGQXQg1dOJPJ.html
06-06-2020||India||Cong names Kharge for K’taka RS seat; another Guj MLA quits||The Congress on Friday named veteran leader Mallikarjun Kharge as its candidate for the June 19 Rajya Sabha elections from Karnataka.Four Rajya Sabha members — two from the Congress (BK Hariprasad and Rajeev Gowda), Prabhakar Kore of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal (Secular) leader D Kupendra Reddy — are retiring on completion of their terms on June 25.In the 223-member Karnataka assembly, a candidate will require 44 votes to be elected to the Upper House of Parliament.The BJP, with 117 legislators, is set to get two seats while the Congress, which has 68 members, will bag one.The JD(S), with 34 legislators, could get the fourth seat provided the Congress supports its candidate.In the evening, the JD(S) legislature party, which met under the leadership of former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, unanimously urged its party supremo and former Prime Minister, HD Deve Gowda, to contest the Rajya Sabha polls.Kumaraswamy later said his father was yet to make up his mind but maintained that Gowda’s “experience and vision would be an asset to the nation” if he decides to contest.Asked if his party will extend support to Gowda, Karnataka Congress chief DK Shivakumar said it will be decided by the Congress high command.Gowda, 87, lost the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Tumkur to the BJP’s Gangasandra Siddappa Basavaraj. His grandson, Prajwal Gowda, won from the JD(S) bastion of Hassan, defeating A Manju of the BJP.The Congress and the JD(S) are not in the best of terms since their 14-month coalition government collapsed on July 23, 2019, following the revolt by rebels from both parties.Congress leader Kharge, popularly known as Solillada Saradara (a leader without defeat) faced his first electoral loss in his decades-long political life against BJP’s Umesh Jadhav in Gulbarga in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.The 77-year-old Kharge got elected to the Karnataka assembly nine consecutive times and twice to the Lok Sabha.An ex-union minister and a former leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, Kharge is currently the party general secretary in-charge on Maharashtra.Shivakumar and leader of the opposition in Karnataka assembly Siddaramiah welcomed the leadership’s decision to field Kharge.Meanwhile, hectic lobbying was on in the BJP, which is expected to announce its candidates in a day or two in the state.In Gujarat, the Congress suffered another jolt on Friday when its, legislator Brijesh Merja, resigned from the assembly. Two Congress legislators -- Akshay Patel and Jitu Chaudhary – already resigned from the assembly on Thursday.With Merja’s resignation, the chances of the Congress winning the second Rajya Sabha seat have diminished as its tally in the 182-member House now stands at 65.Five Congress legislators — Somabhai Patel, Praveen Maru, JV Kakadia, Mangal Gavit and Pradyuman Singh Jadeja — had resigned in March.The total strength of the Gujarat assembly now stands at 172. The ruling BJP has 103 legislators, the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) two and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) one. There is one Independent legislator, Jignesh Mevani.The Congress has fielded its senior leaders Shaktisinh Gohil and Bharatsinh Solanki, while the ruling BJP has named Abhay Bhardwaj, Ramilaben Bara and Narhari Amin as its candidates.The Rajya Sabha elections, earlier scheduled to be held on March 26, were deferred due to the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent imposition of the nationwide lockdown from March 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-names-kharge-for-k-taka-rs-seat-another-guj-mla-quits/story-erdcmRTZCicZCDx3m0Ke4O.html
06-06-2020||India||Haj pilgrims can cancel tickets, get refund: Committee||Haj pilgrims have been told that they can cancel their applications and collect a complete refund.The circular issued by Haj Committee of India (HCOI) on Friday comes even as it awaits a notification from Saudi Ministry of Haj and the central government about provisions for Haj pilgrims this year. The HCOI said it is very difficult to make arrangements because of the epidemic and are advising people to not go for Haj which starts on June 25.Earlier, the Saudi government had suspended the Umrah - a shorter version of the Haj - which sees approximately 25 lakh people visiting the holy city of Mecca and Madina, of which around five lakh pilgrims visit from India.This year, around 1.75 lakh people were expected to leave for Haj from India from June 25 onwards. Of which, 1.25 lakh people had registered through HCOI and other 50,000 would have travelling through private tour operators (PTOs).Maqsood Ahmed Khan, chief executive officer of HCOI, said that owing to a lot of queries by pilgrims, they decided to issue the circular calling for cancellation of applications by pilgrims. Khan added that the committee is of the opinion that it will be difficult to make all the arrangements for Haj at such a short notice.“There was some cancellation charge of around Rs 5,000-7,000 that was levied in previous years if pilgrims cancel, but we are doing away with that this year. If someone cancels, a full refund will be given to them,” said Khan.Khan added those who cancel after the announcement by either of the government will also be provided with the refund, however that may happen within a year.“On our end it is very difficult to make arrangements, we would advise people to not go for Haj this year. About next year, fresh applications will be called later,” Khan added.Zafar Jamal of Federation Haj PTOs of India said that by the month Ramzan they fill their quota of 50,000 pilgrims. However, due to the pandemic, only 30% of pilgrims had registered with them.“We are awaiting details from Saudi government, which is expected to be out on Saturday. Then we will take a call on what needs to be done. There may be a change in quota and the pilgrimage may become expensive then. In that case there will anyways be a lot of cancellations. Even we would advice pilgrims to not opt for pilgrimage this year,” said Jamal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/sports/haj-pilgrims-can-cancel-tickets-get-refund-committee/story-r9WHO1aIEelFl9qLiO4oZN.html
06-06-2020||India||Journals retract two major Covid studies||Two of the world’s leading medical journals have retracted major studies on the coronavirus disease, including one that raised safety concerns about the experimental use of anti-malarial drugs for treatment of Covid-19 amid scientific scrutiny of dubious data sets used for the analysis.Both studies, which were published in The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), used data from a little-known Chicago-based health analytics company called Surgisphere, which has been consistently opaque about its data sources.The study published in The Lancet retrospectively analysed around 96,000 patient records to conclude that the anti-malaria drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine offered no benefits in treating Covid-19 and even raised the risk of irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia) and death. Following the study, the World Health Organization (WHO) suspended the hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine arm of its multi-country Solidarity Trail to validate four experimental Covid-19 treatments, but announced this week that it was resuming the trials.In the absence of a treatment or vaccine, hydoxychloroquine and chloroquine are among several approved drugs being repurposed to treat Covid-19. Among its champions is US President Donald Trump, who has announced that he has been taking hydroxychloroquine as a prophylaxis to prevent infection. The drug has been used to treat people for malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus, against which it has been shown to offer benefits, experts stress.Following Surgisphere’s refusal to share its data and methodology after at least 120 scientists and clinicians called for an independent audit of the data it claimed were sourced from 671 hospitals across six continents, three of the four authors of the hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine paper not affiliated with Surgisphere retracted the study.The retraction came two days after The Lancet issued an “Expression of Concern to alert readers to the fact that serious scientific questions have been brought to our attention” on Wednesday.“We can no longer vouch for the veracity of the primary data sources,” Mandeep Mehra of Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Frank Ruschitzka of University Hospital Zurich, and Amit Patel of University of Utah said in a statement issued by The Lancet. The fourth study author, Dr Sapan Desai, a vascular surgeon and Surgisphere’s chief executive, did not join the retraction.“As such, our reviewers were not able to conduct an independent and private peer review and therefore notified us of their withdrawal from the peer-review process,” the researchers wrote.Late on Thursday, the NEJM also retracted a study using data from the same company that found that blood pressure medications were safe for people with Covid-19.“Rapid review is actually causing problems because the reviewers are being chosen in haste and they don’t have adequate time to look at the data properly. They feel the pressure of time to respond quickly, and may not notice some of the problems with the data. Secondly, you may not get the best combination of reviewers given the deluge of studies out there. When the publication speed is high, study authors and reviewers don’t notice the traffic signals,” said Dr Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India, who is an independent expert on the executive group of the steering committee of Solidarity Trial.“I think that what happened just highlights the self-correcting nature of scientific process. The only lesson I can state is an obvious one. If the conclusions are important to your work, read the paper carefully and judge its merit independently. Do not assume quality from the names or affiliations of the authors, or the name of the journal. The publication process is as prone to human fallibility as anything else,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director of the Delhi-based Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology,.Agrawal is among the top scientists in India to have written to WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan questioning the health agency’s decision to suspend the hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine part of Solidarity Trial following The Lancet study. The letter said the WHO’s decision to pause the trial is “knee-jerk” because the database is flawed and the malaria drugs were given to the sickest patients.India is the world’s biggest producer of hydroxychloroquine, which is approved for use as a prophylaxis and has been given to asymptomatic health workers and contacts of Covid-19 patients since March 23. This was expanded to include frontline workers from May 22.A study from India found that having four or more doses of hydroxychloroquine lowers the odds of getting infected by Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease. The study, published in the Indian Journal of Respiratory Research earlier this week, said the anti-malaria drug lowered the risk of infection by 80% if taken as recommended. The National Task Force for the coronavirus in India recommended a once-a-week maintenance dose for seven weeks -- 400 mg once every week, following the loading dose of 400 mg.Hydroxychloroquine does not prevent disease when given as a post-exposure prophylaxis within four days after high-risk or moderate-risk exposure to Covid-19, reported the first gold-standard clinical trial of hydroxycholoroquine in Covid-19 published in NEJM on Wednesday, Other clinical trials, including some looking at the drugs as treatments, are under way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/journals-retract-two-major-covid-studies/story-EVzDlWf9bUoTgBmVvRUgVK.html
06-06-2020||India||UN terror report reiterated Imran’s ‘confession’: Govt||A new UN report that refers to the presence of thousands of Pakistani terrorists in Afghanistan is a reiteration of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s acknowledgement last year that his country hosts up to 40,000 terrorists, people familiar with developments said on Friday.Reacting to the Pakistan foreign office’s contention that the Indian external affairs ministry was using the UN report to “slander Pakistan”, the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the UN Security Council’s analytical support and sanctions monitoring team had only reiterated what Khan “has already confessed”.As first reported by HT, the UN report, issued last month, said there were some 6,500 Pakistani nationals among foreign terrorists operating in Afghanistan, and the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) play a key role in bringing foreign fighters into the war-torn country.“Pakistan’s foreign office would do well to recall that their prime minister admitted last year that Pakistan still hosts 30,000 to 40,000 terrorists. Pakistan’s leadership is also on record acknowledging that in the past, terrorists had used the country’s soil to carry out terror attacks on other countries,” said one of the people cited above.At the US Institute of Peace in Washington last July, Khan had said Pakistan still has “about 30,000 to 40,000 armed people who have been trained and fought in some part of Afghanistan or Kashmir”.“The UN Security Council’s analytical support and sanctions monitoring team’s report has only reiterated what the prime minister of Pakistan has already confessed. Instead of casting aspersions on the report, Pakistan should introspect and put an end to any kind of support for terrorism emanating from territories under its control,” the person said.The person added that the UN and the world community are “acquainted with the reality that Pakistan is the nerve centre of terrorism”.Pakistan houses “one of the largest numbers of UN-designated terrorists and terrorist entities”, and its “fallacious attempts to point fingers at others cannot deflect attention from the facts on the ground”, the person said.“Moreover, Pakistan’s attempts to create a divide in the traditional and friendly relations between the people of India and Afghanistan will not succeed. The people of Afghanistan and the international community are well aware of who the ‘spoiler’ is, and who is sheltering, training, arming and financing terrorists and sponsoring violence against innocent Afghans and members of the international community,” the person said.In a statement issued on Thursday, Pakistan’s foreign office had contended the external affairs ministry had misrepresented the UN report to slander Pakistan. “Pakistan categorically rejects India’s malicious allegations, which are aimed at misleading the international community,” it said.The statement said there was no reference to “safe havens” in Pakistan in the report, which it claimed was based on “briefings provided in Afghanistan to the [UN team] by certain quarters who have long expressed scepticism about the Afghan peace process”.The foreign office also contended India was trying to “create complications for the Afghan peace process”, and that Pakistan had highlighted what it was said was India’s “sponsorship of terrorist organisations in Afghanistan”.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had reacted to the UN report by expressing India’s “serious concern” at the continued presence in Afghanistan of the senior leadership of al-Qaeda and a large number of foreign terrorists, including 6,500 Pakistan nationals. The report, he said, “vindicates India’s long-standing position that Pakistan remains the epicentre of international terrorism”....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/un-terror-report-reiterated-imran-s-confession-govt/story-s2tjUWV8ZAJG0JCjq1z2eK.html

His paper in the journal Nature in 2017 was among the first to make these linkages. According to India Meteorological Department, the ratio of cyclones in the Arabian Sea, over which the severe cyclonic storm Nisarga formed this week, and the Bay of Bengal, where cyclone Amphan originated on May 20 , is normally 1:4. But this is set to change. Edited excerpts from an email interview :We have been seeing a rise in cyclonic storms over the Arabian Sea in the past few years. What could be the reasons?Attached figure shows the number of extremely severe cyclonic storms (ESCSs) over the Arabian Sea since 1998. You can clearly see that ESCSs are increasing especially during the post-monsoon season (October-December). Our climate models suggest this increase is largely due to global warming.What is the normal frequency of cyclonic storms expected in Arabian Sea?The average number of observed cyclones (including both weak and intense storms) is two per year between 1998-2019 in the Arabian Sea.Why have the frequency of intense/severe cyclonic storms increased in the post-monsoon period over the Arabian Sea?Regarding the increase in ESCSs during the post-monsoon season, we found three factors may be related. One is the rising sea surface temperature, especially over the Arabian Sea. This warm ocean contributed to intensifying cyclones, leading to more severe storms in the Arabian Sea. The second factor is that onset of winter monsoon is delaying, leading to a longer storm season. The last factor is increases in anthropogenic aerosols, leading to changes in sea surface temperature distribution that in turn change monsoon circulation, resulting in more active storms.What is the impact of climate change on tropical cyclones?In general, when global warming proceeds, the surface ocean gets warmer. This warm condition is favourable for intensification of tropical cyclones. But increasing greenhouse gasses also cause warming in the upper atmosphere, that makes the atmosphere more stable. This stable atmosphere is unfavourable for tropical cyclones. Therefore, the frequency of tropical cyclone genesis would decrease when global warming proceeds. But once a storm generates, the storm can develop into an intense storm due to the warmed surface ocean. Above discussion is generally applied to global tropical cyclones. But when we discuss regional tropical cyclones, it is more complex. Some regions get more active storms by changing circulation whereas some regions get less active. Expecting changes in regional tropical cyclones contain a lot of uncertainty.Are we to expect more such severe cyclonic storms to impact the west coast of India?Yes, especially during the post-monsoon season. Our climate models suggest an increasing frequency of severe storms over the Arabian Sea during the post-monsoon season, as we have reported in our paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclones-over-arabian-sea-on-the-rise-due-to-global-warming-hiroyuki-murakami/story-s9301N9LPLRRsu0LGlrhZI.html
06-06-2020||India||One arrested for pregnant elephant’s death||One man has been arrested and two have been detained for questioning by a joint investigating team of the police and forest departments in connection with the suspected killing of a pregnant elephant in Kerala’s Palakkad that has triggered widespread outrage in the state and outside.The 15-year-old elephant died after chewing on a pineapple stuffed with crackers, according to initial reports, but the latest autopsy conducted on her found it was a coconut, and the injuries she suffered were at least two weeks old.The arrested man, identified as P Wilson, is an employee of an estate that cultivates cash crops and spices on the fringes of the Silent Valley National Park, who told investigators that he prepared such snares to check crop-raiding wild boars. Two people who Wilson said had ordered him to prepare such snares have been detained for questioning.“More arrests will take place soon,” said Kerala’s forest minister. K Raju. Union environment minister Prakash Javedkar has announced another probe by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, which has also begun its investigation.The elephant’s painful death came to light on May 27 when forest officer Mohan Krishnan wrote a Facebook post after witnessing it. After biting the cracker-filled coconut, the elephant rushed to the nearby Velliyar river in the Silent Valley rain forest and stood there for days with her trunk and head immersed in the water to nurse its injuries.Forest officials rushed to save the jumbo after local people alerted them, but she succumbed to her injuries on May 27 and during post-mortem it was found to be pregnant. Later, local people said the jumbo was around the river for more than a week.By that time she died, the animal had been enfeebled, perhaps because it was not able to consume food or water because of the injuries inflicted by the blast. Later, local people said the jumbo was around the river for more than a week.Elephants are much adored in Kerala, and caparisoned pachyderms re an integral part of festivals and big public celebrations in the state. They are also a feature of Kerala’s biggest cultural festival, Thrissur Pooram, in which one hundred-odd elephants take part along with an ensemble of percussion instrument players.The incident also highlighted growing man-animal conflict in Kerala, where, in 2018-19, 24 people were killed by wild elephants and 12 died in tiger attacks. Home to many wildlife parks and reserves, the state has 5,706 elephants, according to a 2019 census. The state has 720 domesticated elephants, too, most of them owned by temples.The death of the elephant in Palakkad acquired a political and communal colour after some Bharatiya Janata Party leaders including Maneka Gandhi, an animal rights campaigner, commented on the incident. Maneka Gandhi, inadvertently, said the animal had died in Malappuram, a Muslim-majority district she described as the most violent in the country, although the death took place in Palakkad.Many film artistes including Tovino Thomas, Ashiq Abu and others began an online campaign “#I stand with Malappuram.”“It is sad some people are venting their anger without verifying where exactly it took place. It exposes their communal intention,” said P K Kunhalikuty, the Muslim League MP who represents Malappuram, adding that such comments were an insult to the people of his constituency. Communist Party of India (Marxist) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan also condemned “the move to communalise an unfortunate incident.” Wildlife activists said this was not first elephant death of its kind. In April, another female elephant died in Kollam in south Kerala after she bit into a cracker-filled water melon. Two years ago, a tusker died in Idukki after swallowing jaggery-coated explosives, they said. Usually in such cases, it is difficult to pinpoint the offenders as elephants travel long distances in search of food and water, they said, adding most such cases remain unnatural deaths only on paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-arrested-for-pregnant-elephant-s-death/story-6T8XTVIk3uoIbJliYxZW6O.html
06-06-2020||India||UN body warns of another invasion of locusts in July||India might face another attack of crop-munching desert locusts in July, the Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations (FAO) has warned amid an ongoing outbreak that has prompted the Centre to issue a warning to 16 states, including the worst-affected Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.In its situation update on Thursday, FAO said early migration of spring-bred locust swarms from southwest Pakistan to Rajasthan occurred in May before the monsoon, and some swarms travelled to northern states for the first time since 1962.While the swarms will oscillate east and westwards before returning to lay eggs with the onset of the monsoon in Rajasthan’s deserts, successive waves of swarms will arrive from southern Iran in June and the “Horn of Africa” peninsula in July, according to FAO.According to experts, the swarms causing the present outbreak and chomping through vegetation across farmlands in Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh entered India from Pakistan in April. The existing swarms too came from “Horn of Africa”.“In East Africa, second-generation breeding is underway in northwest Kenya and numerous hopper bands have formed that will give rise to immature swarms from the second week of June until at least mid-July.“A similar situation is underway in Somalia and Ethiopia. Most of the new swarms will migrate northwards from Kenya to Ethiopia and traverse South Sudan to Sudan after mid-June while other swarms will move to northern Ethiopia. Swarms that reach northeast Somalia are likely to migrate across the northern Indian Ocean to the Indo-Pakistan border area,” FAO said.Locusts can fly up to 150km in a day and a one-square-kilometre swarm can eat as much food as 35,000 people.KL Gurjar, the Indian government’s Locust Warning Organization (LWO), said many villages in Barmer and Jodhpur districts in Rajasthan continued witnessing locust attacks. Locusts have been controlled in 65,000-hectare area, he said, adding that there has been no new swarm of locusts for the last four days in the state.“...some adult groups and swarms are expected to arrive in India from the spring-breeding areas (such as Iran and Pakistan). Therefore, vigilance will continue for expected invasion of locust in coming days,” he said.LWO, a federal agency to monitor and control the gregarious pests, said Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are likely to see the use of helicopters to control the situation.Drones, fire tenders and tractors have been already used to spray chemicals on locusts when they settle over trees at night. But since the problem is persisting and the kharif season is about to begin, the government is considering pulling out all the stops.“We will use helicopters too to control locusts wherever these insects are moving in large numbers,” Gurjar said. “We are in the process (of getting the choppers for the same).”Locust presence was seen in parts of Vindhya, Bundelkhand and Gwalior-Chambal regions of Madhya Pradesh on Friday. In Rajasthan, places such as Barmer, Pali, Jodhpur, Jalore, Nagaur and Bikaner reported locust swarms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/un-body-warns-of-another-invasion-of-locusts-in-july/story-ejXzmlkPdDEqcSAArjcfoN.html
06-06-2020||India||ITBP puts into operation one command each in C’garh, Guwahati||As the standoff between the armed forces of India and China continues at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the Indo-Tibet Border Police (ITBP) has operationalised its newly sanctioned commands in Chandigarh and Guwahati for better supervision of troop deployment.The cabinet had, in October 2019, approved two new commands -- the Western Command at Chandigarh and Eastern Command at Guwahati -- to be headed by an additional director general (ADG) rank officer in the ITBP.In an order issued on June 3, ITBP director general S S Deswal said: an “imperative need is felt to make these establishments functional immediately”. Inspector general (operations) M S Rawat will take over charge of the western command in Chandigarh with immediate effect “in the capacity of ADG”, the order said.Another IG rank officer will soon head the Guwahati-based eastern command, an official said. The commands will streamline operations, intelligence, deployment and administrative movements of ITBP personnel to the border regions and also bring better synergy with the army that secures the LAC, the officer added.ITBP currently has no ADG rank officer posted with it so a decision was taken to deploy IG rank officers.Officials said the recent standoff between Indian and Chinese forces in the Ladakh area and other parts of the LAC was a major reason for the quick initiation of the two commands.The ITBP has recently augmented its strength at the border posts owing to the standoff with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA).There are three ADG posts in the force at present and none is occupied as the Delhi high court has ordered a stay on the appointment of Indian Police Service (IPS) officers to paramilitary or Central Armed Police Forces of the rank of inspector general and above.While sanctioning the two commands on October 23, 2019, the Union cabinet had also sanctioned about 60 posts of officer ranks in the force.The western command will have control over ITBP deployments in the Dehradun-based Northern Frontier that includes the Shimla, Dehradun and Bareilly sectors, and the North-West Frontier, which was shifted from Chandigarh to Leh in April last year and includes the Srinagar and Ladakh sectors.

It undertakes short-range and long-haul patrols along the LAC as part of its mandate to guard the icy Himalayan front marred by incidents of transgressions between the two countries due to differing perception of the border region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/itbp-puts-into-operation-one-command-each-in-c-garh-guwahati/story-wkvn5lX7WkdSgVHkIqdObP.html
06-06-2020||India||Won’t allow differences to escalate, both sides say||A day ahead of crucial talks between Indian and Chinese army commanders on the stand-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the two sides on Friday agreed on not allowing their differences to escalate into disputes while respecting each other’s concerns.In the first formal diplomatic meeting between the two sides since tensions flared along the LAC, joint secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry held talks with Wu Jianghao, director general in China’s foreign ministry, through video conference and reviewed bilateral relations, including “current developments”, according to a readout from the Indian side.Statements issued in New Delhi and Beijing referred to not allowing differences to become disputes. The Indian statement spoke about respecting each other’s sensitivities and concerns, while the Chinese side’s readout said the two sides should not pose a threat to each other and should enhance “strategic mutual trust”.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Friday’s meeting was meant to set the stage for the talks on June 6 between the general officer commanding of Leh-based 14 Corps, Lt Gen Harinder Singh, and his Chinese counterpart.Tensions built up along the LAC following violent clashes between hundreds of Indian and Chinese troops in the Sikkim and Ladakh sectors early last month. Army officers of the two sides have held several meetings along the disputed border but have been unable to break the impasse.During Friday’s meeting, both sides agreed that in accordance with the guidance provided by their leadership, they “should handle their differences through peaceful discussion bearing in mind the importance of respecting each other’s sensitivities, concerns and aspirations and not allow them to become disputes”, the external affairs ministry said in a statement without giving details.The two sides “recalled the consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, that peaceful, stable and balanced relations between India and China will be a positive factor for stability in the current global situation”.This was a reference to the guidance from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping to the militaries of both countries to maintain peace and tranquillity along the border after their first informal summit at Wuhan in 2018. That summit was organised to put ties back on an even keel after the 73-day standoff at Doklam in 2017.A statement issued by China’s foreign ministry in Mandarin said the two sides agreed that under the strategic guidance of their leaders, they “should not pose a threat to each other, should present opportunities for development and not allow their differences to escalate into disputes”. The statement called for the two sides to “properly manage and control differences”.The statement also called for enhancing “strategic mutual trust”, and deepening mutually beneficial cooperation and promoting the celebrations marking the 70th anniversary of diplomatic ties to “ensure that the giant ship of China-India relations always moves forward in the right direction”.The officials of the two sides also exchanged views on the challenge posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, cooperation at different multilateral forums.The Chinese statement further said the two countries should deepen cooperation in fighting epidemics, oppose the “politicisation of epidemics”, support the World Health Organization (WHO) and promote the building of public health systems.They should also uphold and promote multilateralism and oppose “unilateralism, protectionism and hegemonism”, and jointly safeguard international fairness and justice and the common interests of developing countries, the Chinese side added.India and China have been in touch through diplomatic and military channels in New Delhi and Beijing over the past few weeks to address the border tensions. Joint secretary Srivastava has been involved in these contacts, the people cited above said.The army commanders are set to met on June 6, almost a month after tensions between India and China flared along the disputed border and took bilateral ties to a new low.India has dismissed China’s contention that its troops were hindering the activities of Chinese troops along the LAC, and has accused Chinese forces of hindering patrols on the Indian side. The Indian government has also made it clear that it won’t allow any change in the status quo along the LAC and that it will tackle the prevailing situation with “strength and restraint”.Amitabh Mathur, a former special secretary in the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), said there was nothing new in the two sides talking about not allowing differences to become disputes. “Hasn’t this line been said before? It has become a sort of cliché,” he said.“While they may say they don’t want differences to become disputes, we have a dispute on our hand. The defence minister has said that the Chinese have come in, and in large numbers. We have to put an end to it somewhere. If the Chinese agree to go back, why did they come in? The clues to that will be in any possible terms of settlement between the two sides,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/won-t-allow-differences-to-escalate-both-sides-say/story-kOFEmsZcUk0d4TU0tuXrJN.html
06-06-2020||India||Ministries asked not to start new schemes this fiscal year||The government has directed ministries not to launch any new scheme that entails capital expenditure in this financial year, and suspended already approved projects, barring those under the Rs 20.97 lakh crore economic relief and stimulus package it unveiled in the aftermath of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.The aim is to use scarce resources prudently, according to a finance ministry order. A copy of the directive, issued on Thursday, was reviewed by Hindustan Times.“It may be appreciated that in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, there is an unprecedented demand on public financial resources, and a need to use resources prudently in accordance with emerging and changing priorities,” the department of expenditure, an arm of the finance ministry, said in the order.The government has delegated financial powers to appraise and approve all public funded schemes and projects to the department of expenditure. The move comes against the backdrop of an expected fall in revenue and concerns that the economy may contract this financial year because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown.“This was an expected step taken by the government because of the alarming trends coming from all sectors. With the possibility of India looking at a recession for the first time in recent memory, there is an overwhelming demand for funds from all sources; there is absolutely no scope for the government to be a spendthrift,” said SR Patnaik, head of taxation at the legal firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas: The order, however, exempts schemes announced under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY), the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-Reliant India Initiative) and any other special package to be unveiled at a future date for alleviating the crisis caused by the outbreak of Covid-19.After the government announced the nationwide lockdown on March 24 with effect from the following day to curb the spread of the viral disease, it announced a series of relief and economic stimulus packages.The last in the five-part Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan package, aimed at relieving the distress caused to small businesses, farmers and migrant workers, was announced on May 17. The total package was worth Rs 20.97 lakh crore that included a Rs 1.7 lakh crore welfare package under PMGKY announced on March 26 and Rs 8.01 lakh crore of monetary measures put in place by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).PMGKY focused on additional food transfers at no cost to poor households, additional cash for vulnerable segments, concessions on government schemes aimed at helping households reduce their expenditure, and support to those in the frontline of the battle against the pandemic.The department of expenditure said that the schemes that have been already approved for the current financial year would remain suspended until March 31, 2021 or further orders, whichever is earlier. Even schemes that have received in-principle approval from the department have been suspended.“No funds may be released for schemes that are not in strict conformity to the instructions given above...,” the order said. Any exceptions to these guidelines will require approval of the department of expenditure, it added.This is the latest set of austerity measures announced by the government to mobilise resources to fund Covid control measures and offset revenue losses caused by the 68-day nationwide lockdown starting from March 25. Although, the government has withheld the monthly Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection data for April and May, officials said on condition of anonymity that the total monthly revenue in these two months could to be only one-third of collection in normal times. The GST collection in March was Rs 97,597 crore. Earlier, the revenue collection had exceeded Rs 1 lakh crore for four consecutive months since November 2019.In April, the government held back payment of additional dearness allowance to all central government employees for 18 months and proposed a similar move for state government staff to collectively save about Rs 1.20 lakh crore that, it said, would be used in its fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. The President, vice president, prime minister, his council of ministers, and members of Parliaments have taken salary cuts.In an interview with HT published on May 18, immediately after the last tranche of the economic stimulus package was announced, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government had plans to mobilise additional resources required to fund the fight against Covid-19. “We took a comprehensive assessment (of what we would need) and then went with this number (Rs 20.97 lakh crore). At the time itself we were conscious that we were looking at this stimulus and also a fall in revenue. We have to see how it goes,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministries-asked-not-to-start-new-schemes-this-fiscal-year/story-8DsrvzjArJ2yr1ohFhtmvI.html
06-06-2020||India||‘More arrests soon’: Kerala minister after 1 held in elephant’s death case||A man was arrested and two others were detained for questioning on Friday by the joint investigation team of the police and forest departments in connection with the brutal killing of a pregnant elephant in Kerala’s Palakkad, the state’s forest minister K Raju said.The arrested man was identified as P Wilson, an employee of an estate that cultivates cash crops and spices on the fringe areas of the Silent Valley National Park.Wilson reportedly told the probe team that he used to make explosive-laden snares to check crop-raiding wild boars. He said he made the latest snare after he was asked by two others, who have been identified.“More arrests will take place soon,” the forest minister said. Union environment minister Prakash Javedkar had announced another probe by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, which has also begun its investigation.Autopsy report The death of the 15-year-old elephant came to light on May 27 when a forest officer, Mohan Krishnan, wrote a Facebook post after witnessing its painful death in a river. Initial reports suggested that the elephant died after eating a pineapple stuffed with crackers but the latest post-mortem report said it was a coconut and that her wounds were two-week-old. By the time the elephant died, all that remained of her body was a skeleton.The 15-year-old elephant reportedly rushed to the nearby Velliyar River in the Silent Valley rain forests after eating the cracker-filled fruit and stood there for many days with its trunk and head immersed in the water perhaps to nurse its wounds. Forest officials rushed to save the jumbo after local people alerted them but it succumbed to its injuries on May 27 and during the autopsy, it was found to be pregnant. Locals later said the jumbo was around the river for more than a week.War of wordsThe incident took a political colour later after many BJP leaders, including Maneka Gandhi, said Malappuram is the most violent district in the country.Though the incident took place in Palakkad many inadvertently named the Muslim-majority Malappuram and some even dragged Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleging that it took place in Wayanad, his Lok Sabha constituency in north Kerala.“It is sad some people are venting their anger without verifying where exactly it took place. It exposes their communal intention,” PK Kunhalikuty, the Muslim League MP who represents Malappuram, said.Kunhalikuty said it was a big insult to the people of his constituency. CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan also condemned “the move to communalise an unfortunate incident.” Upset with a particular district being targeted, many film artists including Tovino Thomas, Ashiq Abu and others began an online campaign “#I stand with Malappuram” which was supported by many.Many posters came up in Malappuram condemning sweeping comments without verifying facts.Previous deathsAfter the incident triggered countrywide protests, many wildlife activists said this was not the first death of its sort.Another female elephant was killed in Kollam in south Kerala in April after it ate cracker-filled watermelon and two years ago another jumbo was killed in Idukki after swallowing jaggery-coated explosives, they said. They said in such cases it is difficult to pinpoint offenders as the animals travel 100-200km a day in search of food and water and added that most of the cases remain unnatural death only on paper.The shocking incident has revived the debate on the growing man-animal conflict in the state which has a 29.1% forest cover. In 2018-19, 24 people were killed by wild elephants and 12 died in tiger attacks and 9400 man-animal conflict incidents were reported, according to the latest forest statistics. Kerala, which is home to many wildlife parks and reserves, has 5,706 elephants, according to the 2019 census. The state has 720 domesticated jumbos and a majority of them are owned by temples.The Guruvayur Sree Krishna temple has the highest number of captive jumbos at 59.Elephants are adored in Kerala and many captive animals carry names. Caparisoned elephants are an integral part of all festivals and big gatherings in the state.Hundred-odd elephants take part in the annual festival of ‘Thrissur Pooram’, Kerala’s biggest cultural festival, along with an ensemble of percussion instrument players.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-arrests-soon-kerala-minister-after-1-held-in-elephant-s-death-case/story-gd2gQPWACox1fmsp5IaCoI.html
06-06-2020||India||Chhattisgarh: About 80% of registered APL families took benefits of PDS||About 80% of above poverty level (APL) families in Chhattisgarh have accessed ration shops for rations distributed under the public distribution system (PDS) during the Covid-19 lockdown, according to figures from the state government.Senior officers believe there was an increase in registration of APL and blow poverty line (BPL) families since large numbers of migrant workers returned to Chhattisgarh from other states, and the average increase in purchase of PDS rations by APL families shows that the quality of rations is good and no hoarding has taken place.People who get ration at Rs1 per kg under the National Food Security Act, Antyodaya Anna Yojana and a state government scheme for disabled come under the BPL category and people who take ration at Rs10 per kg are considered as APL families.Chhattisgarh has a universal PDS and everyone is entitled to benefit from the system. In June 2019, the state government decided to provide rice at subsidised prices to APL families in the state.Food and civil supplies secretary Kamalpreet Singh said that though there is no concept of BPL and APL families since the implementation of the National Food Security Act, the state government has categorised families according to the rate at which rations are provided since everyone in Chhattisgarh benefits from PDS.“In Chhattisgarh, the National Food Security Act is being implemented but it doesn’t cover everyone. Plus, we give double the rations [allocated under] the Act. We have two other schemes – Antyodaya Scheme and a scheme for disabled people – and they all get rations for Rs 1 per kg,” he said.“The second category is for the middle class, where people can register themselves and can get rations at Rs10 per kg. They are considered as APL,” Singh said, adding that 2.47 crore people are provided rations under PDS in the state.APL card holders who went to ration shops during the lockdown said they were saving money since the government was providing rations at a subsidy.“I am from a middle-class family. I am in a private job and have an APL card. I picked up 70 kg of rice from a ration shop during the lockdown because I wanted to save money,” said Sattu Chandrakar, a resident of Raipur.Official figures show that in January, the total number of APL cards was 838,719 and rations were distributed to 613,405 card holders. In February, the number of APL cards increased to 862,197 and rations were provided to 655,936 card holders.In March, the number of APL cards again increased to 869,405 and rations were distributed to 661,334 card holders. In April, the number of cards was 881,028, and rations were provided to 744,848 people, and the number of cards in May was 894,637 and rations were given to 688,496 people.The figures show the number of APL cards has been increasing every month and more people in this category are going to ration shops to buy grains under PDS.An average of about 80% of APL cards holders were provided rations in March, April and May, with March recording the highest figure of about 84% of the total APL cards.On the other hand, registration of BPL category families has increased because of migrant workers returning to the state and an average of 97% of registered families are getting rations under the scheme, a senior officer said.Commenting on the figures, Singh said: “About 80% of APL families reached ration shops. There are reports that people went to ration shops in cars. We believe that PDS works in times of crisis and secondly, the quality of rice has improved and that is why APL families preferred using PDS rations during this lockdown.”“We have distributed about 14 lakh metric tonnes of rice under PDS till now, of which the Central government’s share is about 50%,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-about-80-of-registered-apl-families-took-benefits-of-pds/story-8qnjJTK4xXTE1nbTEUokfM.html
06-06-2020||India||Ahead of today’s meet over Ladakh standoff, India signals a realistic approach||Indian military officials will walk into a meeting on Saturday with their Chinese counterparts to attempt to resolve the month-long row over the Line of Actual Control with the knowledge that it may not be possible to achieve an immediate breakthrough to the Ladakh standoff, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times.Saturday’s meeting is the first high-level meeting between Lt General Harinder Singh, the general officer commanding of Leh-based 14 Corps, and his Chinese counterpart who heads the People’s Liberation Army’s Group Army since the May 5 scuffle between soldiers near Pangong lake and subsequent stand-off at Galwan riverulet.The last round of talks between delegations led by two major general-rank officers of the two armies on June 2 had been inconclusive.Officials, however, underline that it was a positive sign that both sides were talking to each other through established military and diplomatic channels. But the dialogue does not mean an immediate resolution. “This is the eventuality that we are prepared for,” one of them said.India has already made it clear it wants the Chinese troops to move back and restore status quo ante on the four positions.“We are not in a hurry… and I believe, neither is the Chinese side,” a government functionary told Hindustan Times signalling that the government had adopted a “realistic approach” to the standoff and the dialogue process .An official said given the high stakes involved, he expected the Ladakh standoff to continue for longer than the 73-day Doklam standoff.“Both sides have brought in elements that may continue for some months”.Also Read: India China standoff explained: Bridge over troubled watersThe May 5 scuffle at Pangong triggered by an aggressive group of Chinese soldiers was the starting point of Beijing scaling up its presence along the eastern Ladakh border.Over the next few days, China amassed two Combined Arms Brigades of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at Galwan Valley and Pangong Tso patrolling points along the 3,488-kilometre-long Line of Actual Control (LAC). This comes to around 8,000 soldiers plus support elements like artilleryIndian officials say the standoff at Pangong Tso appears to be aimed at dominating the Srijap mountain that overlooks the lake. But the game in Galwan valley - where the Chinese military has parked itself around three patrolling points - is a lot more complex.“Broadly, our understanding is that the PLA’s focus on the Galwan valley is prompted by multiple objectives that are mostly linked to stalling the upgrade of border infrastructure that has picked up pace in the past two years,” a person familiar with the government’s position on the standoff said.For one, China wants to stall the construction of the winding 255-km Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie road that would give the Indian army easy access to the last military post south of the dominating Karakoram Pass.The Indian side is, however, determined to complete construction of the entire stretch by this summer including the 60-metre bridge across the Galwan rivulet or nallah near the point of its confluence with Shyok river. “We have to complete the concrete bridge this month, and the road well before the onset of winter,” one official said.Also Read: As the LAC heats up, reading China’s playbook, writes Shyam SaranOnce this road is completed, the military capacity and capability would go up manifold in the region and enable the army to put counter pressure on the PLA at the Karakoram Pass, Chip Chap river area, Trig Heights, Hot Springs, Galwan and Depsang Plains.“India will then have the capacity to counter retaliate to Chinese pressure,” an official said. This is an eventuality that the Chinese, which had been upgrading its border infrastructure for decades, is trying to avoid.In the long term, Indian strategists told Hindustan Times, the Chinese effort appears to make the Indian positions in the Daulat Beg Oldie sector untenable. On its part, China has been pushing to open a route through this sector for a better linkage to Pakistan.Currently, China and its all weather ally Pakistan are linked by the Karakoram highway via the Khunjerab Pass.But China is looking to link Tibet with occupied Gilgit Baltistan through a better all-weather road.The idea is to have a better all weather road to Pakistan so that China Pakistan Economic Corridor is serviced throughout the year.Also Read: India is sensitive to China but won’t allow change in any border sectorChina has already built a road through Gilgit’s Shaksgam valley that lies north-west of Siachen glacier. Pakistan had ceded around 5,163 sq km of the Shaksgam valley to China in a controversial 1963 boundary agreement.If the Chinese are able to cut us off at Daulat Beg Oldie, they can put pressure through axis Murgo-Saser La-Sansoma , a major logistical supply point on Shyok River for Indian soldiers deployed to dominate Siachen Glacier.That would help Beijing’s ally Pakistan.“In a way,” an army officer said, “you could say that what General Pervez Musharaff could not achieve through the Kargil war, China’s paramount leader Xi Jinping, chairman of its Central Military Commission, expects to achieve before he demits office”.Also Read: Ladakh sector’s Galwan Valley and its history in Sino-India relationsThe officer said the Chinese side could also try to stall the extension of an airstrip at Daulat Beg Oldie that would allow heavy-weight transport aircrafts also to land.While South Block has been tight-lipped about the motivation of the Chinese aggression along the LAC, it is quite evident that the pinpricks was also aimed to message Beijing’s unhappiness over certain economic measures taken by India after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.The Chinese government had taken offence to India’s new rule notified in early April that blocked Chinese companies from acquiring Indian firms without government approval. The decision to tilt the balance in favour of Indian companies hasn’t gone down too well with Beijing. As part of this exercise, the government decided that all procurement orders of Rs 200 crore or less could not go to foreign companies. The government’s hard push to the Make in India campaign hasn’t gone down well with Beijing also over concerns that it could discourage cheap exports from China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-talks-with-china-over-ladakh-standoff-india-signals-a-realistic-approach/story-yhfSaZk0vucG6f1vPKZHrK.html
