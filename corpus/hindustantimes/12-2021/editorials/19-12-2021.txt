19-12-2021||Editorials||How to reverse learning loss||The Telangana Higher Education Department is reviewing the effectiveness of its online classes after more than half of Classes 11 and 12 students failed the first-year or Class 11 exam, a report in a national daily said on Sunday. The students are now in Class 12, having been promoted en masse as the final exam could not be held in April due to the raging second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. The exams were the first serious one after educational institutions closed on March 25, 2020. The results are yet another illustration of the severe learning loss that has happened across different educational segments and social classes (due to the lack of inadequate online learning infrastructure) â€” and it is almost a certainty that the situation is the same in all states. The worst hit have been the primary class students. Around 320 million students have not stepped into a classroom for more than a year. Schools started reopening only in July and they have been plagued by closures.
