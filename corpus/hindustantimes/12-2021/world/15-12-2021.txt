One person has died after contracting the variant, which is set to become the dominant strain in London.More than 146,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the United Kingdom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-reports-record-daily-covid-cases-with-omicron-spreading-rapidly-101639587584789.html
15-12-2021||World||Putin, Xi hold call amid tensions with the West||Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held a video summit on Wednesday, lauding bilateral ties as a pillar of multilateralism and hoping to boost economic engagement in a show of solidarity as Beijing and Moscow come under increasing pressure from the western bloc on issues like Taiwan, Ukraine and human rights.Putin said he looks forward to attending the opening ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing and meeting Xi. He is the first leader of a country to do so in a show of strength with China against the backdrop of several western democracies announcing a diplomatic boycott of the Games over the state of human rights in Xinjiang.China and Russia have come increasingly closer under strongmen leaders Xi and Putin, seemingly forming a bloc of their own against the US and its allies.Putin won support from Xi for his push to obtain binding security guarantees for Russia from the West, a Kremlin official said, according to Reuters.Xi addressed Putin as his “old friend,” while the latter called Xi as both his “dear friend” and his “honourable friend” as they talked about a wide range of issues.The all-round practical cooperation between China and Russia has demonstrated tremendous political strengths and huge potential, Xi said.Xi, according to the official news agency Xinhua, said China and Russia have acted as responsible major countries, becoming the central pillar of practising multilateralism and safeguarding international equity and justice.The Chinese President added that trade between China and Russia in the first three quarters of 2021 has topped $100 billion for the first time, and for the whole year, bilateral trade looks to reach a record high.Putin said Russia “consistently stands against the scheme of politicising sports” in context of the diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics and also extended Moscow’s “staunch” support on China’s position on Taiwan.He said Russia-China relations are a paradigm of international relations in the 21st century.“Their relations embody a high degree of strategic mutual trust and have set an example of mutual benefit based on non-interference in each other’s internal affairs and mutual respect for each other’s interests,” Putin noted as per the Chinese official readout.“A new model of cooperation has been formed between our countries, based among other things on such principles as not interfering in internal affairs (of each other), respect for each other’s interests, determination to turn the shared border into a belt of eternal peace and good neighborliness,” Putin said, according to the Kremlin.Xi added that the Russian president “strongly supported China’s efforts to protect key national interests and firmly opposed attempts to drive a wedge between our countries.”Diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions have brought Beijing and Moscow with each supporting the other on most international issues.While China has faced sanctions over abuses against Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang and for carrying out a crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, Russia has faced international sanctions and censure for annexing Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and over the poisoning and imprisonment of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.Xi said that he has met Putin for the 37 times since 2013, according to the Russian translation of their remarks, quoted by the NYT, as the virtual summit began.From the appearance of the current state of China-Russia ties, the two leaders are set to meet many more times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-xi-hold-call-amid-tensions-with-the-west-101639576821987.html
15-12-2021||World||Omicron will become dominant strain of Covid in EU by mid-Jan: Bloc president||European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday said the Coronavirus's Omicron variant, first detected in South Africa, will become the dominant strain in the 27-nation bloc by mid-January.The head of the EU’s executive branch, however, exuded confidence that the bloc is well prepared to fight the highly contagious strain. Given the high rate of vaccination in the bloc and the availability of vaccine doses, von der Leyen said Europe is now in a better position to fight the virus.She said more than 300 million people in the EU have been fully vaccinated and that 62 million people have gotten a booster jab.The commission chief further said the EU is facing a "double challenge" of increasing cases in recent weeks due to the Delta variant and rising threat from Omicron.“We're seeing an increasing number of people falling ill, a greater burden on hospitals and unfortunately an increase in the number of deaths," she was quoted as telling European lawmakers.Von der Leyen said the increase in infections remains due “almost exclusively" to the delta variant. “And what I'm concerned about is that we are now seeing the new variant Omicron on the horizon, which is apparently even more infectious."The alarming rise of new infections has prompted the implementations of further restrictions across Europe.Italy has made negative tests mandatory from vaccinated visitors even as the move has raised concerns that it will limit free movement at a time when many EU citizens travel to see their relatives and loved ones.Portugal adopted a similar measure on December 1, requiring a mandatory negative test for all flights arriving in Portugal, even for people with health passes and regardless of their point of origin or nationality.According to an analysis of data from South Africa, where the new variant is driving a surge in infections, Omicron seems to be more easily spread from person to person and better at evading vaccines, but also milder in terms of severity.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-will-become-dominant-strain-of-covid-in-eu-by-mid-jan-bloc-president-101639573910467.html
15-12-2021||World||Researchers find a new strategy to boost vaccine efficacy amid Omicron spread||Amid the emergence of Omicron cases across the globe, researchers have found that adding a component of a viral protein in the Covid-19 vaccines, can boost their immune response and also provide increased protection against new variants.The researchers of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) discovered in their findings that using a fragment or component from viral polymerase protein, which is found in SARS-CoV-2 as well as other coronaviruses (SARS, MERS and the common cold) can trigger a more robust immune response from the vaccines.The study, which has been published in the ‘Cell Reports Journal’ comes at a time when the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that the Omicron variant reduces the efficacy of existing Covid-19 vaccines and is also more transmissible.“Given the current available data, it is likely that Omicron will outpace the Delta variant where community transmission occurs,” the United Nations health agency said in a technical brief on December 12.Also Read | Omicron Covid-19 variant more transmissible, reduces vaccine efficiency: WHOFirst discovered in South Africa, cases of Omicron Covid-19 variant has now spread to 63 countries, including India. As many as 64 cases of Omicron have been confirmed in India, with West Bengal reporting its first infection a few hours earlier after a 7-year-old boy tested positive. Earlier in the day, Rajasthan and Delhi also reported four cases each of the Covid-19 variant.According to the researchers of UCLA, their findings will pave the way for preparing a new generation of Covid-19 vaccines that would be able to tackle current variants such as Omicron and Delta, and the ones that may arise in the future.According to researchers, most Covid-19 vaccines use a component of the spike protein found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 to trigger the immune system of the body to produce antibodies. However, newer variants such as Omicron and Delta, which carry mutations to the spike protein, can make them less detectable to the immune cells and antibodies stimulated by vaccination.Viral polymerases serve as engines that coronaviruses (all types) use to replicate themselves, thereby permitting the infection to spread swiftly. However, unlike spike protein, these proteins are unlikely to change or mutate even as viruses evolve.Also Read | Two weeks into Omicron outbreak: What do we know so farResearchers stressed on rare and naturally occurring T cells that are installed with molecular receptors on their surfaces for recognising foreign protein components called ‘antigens’. They said when a T cell encounters an antigen that its receptor recognised, it self-replicates and produces additional immune cells - some of which target and kill infected cells immediately, whereas others remain inside the body for years to fight the same infection should it ever return.To find out if the human immune system has T cell receptors capable of detecting viral polymerase protein, researchers exposed blood samples from healthy individuals (collected prior to the Covid-19 outbreak) to the viral polymerase antigen. The study found that some T cell receptors did, in fact, recognise the polymerase.The researchers then used a method called ‘CLInt-Seq’ to genetically sequence these T cell receptors. They also engineered T cells to carry these polymerase-targeting receptors, which allowed the research team to study the receptors' ability to detect and kill SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.The team is now conducting more studies to analyse viral polymerase as a potential new component for Covid-19 vaccines in order to find a strategy to increase their protection and long-lasting immune response.The study is authored by Pavlo Nesterenko, a UCLA graduate student, and Owen Witte, who holds the presidential chair in developmental immunology in the UCLA Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics. While Pavlo is the first author, Witte holds the corresponding position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/researchers-find-a-new-strategy-to-boost-vaccine-efficacy-amid-omicron-spread-101639565437300.html

15-12-2021||World||Rwanda reports six confirmed Omicron cases; imposes shutdowns, quarantine rules||Rwanda has detected its first six cases of the fast-spreading Covid-19 Omicron variant, prompting the government to escalate pandemic measures, including shutting down nightclubs and extending quarantines for international travellers.Visitors will now be required to quarantine for three days instead of the current 24 hours, the government announced, after recording six cases of the Omicron variant in travellers and their contacts."A Covid-19 PCR test will be taken upon arrival and an additional test, taken on day three and on day seven at own cost, from the arrival date," the Ministry of Health said in a statement late Tuesday.The current midnight to 4 am curfew will remain in place while nightclubs have been ordered to close their doors barely three months after reopening.Omicron, first detected by South Africa and reported to the WHO on November 24, has a large number of mutations, leading many governments to swiftly reimpose containment measures to rein in transmission.Early data suggests it is more transmissible than the Delta variant, which was first identified in India and accounts for the bulk of the world's coronavirus cases.Rwanda, a country of 13 million people, has enforced some of the strictest containment measures on the continent and implemented a rigorous regime of testing and contact-tracing.Last month, it became the first country in East Africa to bar direct flights to and from nine countries in southern Africa where the Omicron variant was first reported.In total, the country has registered 100,763 cases of Covid-19 and 1,344 deaths, according to official figures.Rwanda has so far fully vaccinated 4.2 million people -- around 60 percent of Rwandans aged 18 and above.Unlike other countries in the region, it has also started administering vaccine booster shots to eligible adults.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rwanda-reports-six-confirmed-omicron-cases-imposes-shutdowns-quarantine-rules-101639559455706.html

The results, released on Tuesday, were the first-published preliminary data on the impact of Sinovac's vaccine against the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.According to the researchers, the study has now been accepted for publication in the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal. It showed that none of the 25 Sinovac vaccine recipients turned up with sufficient antibodies to neutralise the Omicron variant; only five of them had neutralising ability (not from antibodies), and vaccine efficiency was reduced significantly to 20-24%.Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine produced some antibodies against Omicron but showed no neutralisation, according to Penny Moore, a professor at Johannesburg’s University of The Witwatersrand, which conducted the study.The virologist said that laboratory experiments were conducted on blood plasma samples from people who had had two doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine or the J&J single-shot inoculation. Although the vaccine appeared to provide some protection against Omicron, it is most likely from some other means such as stimulation of immune cells as opposed to neutralising antibodies.None of the pharmaceutical firms have yet responded to the results of the lab studies on Omicron, although a Sinovac spokesperson told the Reuters news agency that the company's own laboratory testing had shown the effectiveness of the third dose of its vaccine.Scientists say it is still too early to know if Omicron causes more or less severe Covid-19 than previous variants, but in the meanwhile, the fast-spreading Delta variant remains dominant worldwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-routs-j-j-vaccine-in-lab-study-may-evade-sinovac-and-biontech-too-101639549471713.html
15-12-2021||World||Amid violence, Myanmar citizens urge gas sanctions to stop military funding||The young woman in Myanmar decided to speak out when she realized that money from the company she loved was now in the hands of the military leaders she hated.She and her parents had long worked for Total Energies, the French company that operates a lucrative gas field off the coast of southern Myanmar with a state-owned enterprise. But in February, the military took over Myanmar’s government and its bank accounts, including those that receive hundreds of millions of dollars each year from the Total gas field, known as Yadana.As military abuses such as the murder and detention of thousands have grown, the young woman joined others across Myanmar in a groundswell of support for targeted sanctions on oil and gas funds, the country’s single largest source of foreign currency revenue. But Western governments — most notably the United States and France — have refused to take that step amid lobbying from energy company officials and resistance from countries such as Thailand, which gets gas from Myanmar. On Friday, the U.S. announced a raft of sanctions against several Myanmar officials and entities, but again left out oil or gas revenues.The young woman chanted slogans outside Total's offices, and later protested the military's takeover. She said she has since lost her job, and was thrown into prison for three weeks.“We had a good relationship and good memories of Total,” said the young woman, whose name, like those of other Myanmar gas workers in this story, is being withheld by The Associated Press for their safety. “Total has taken a lot from Myanmar....so they should at least help Myanmar with a little bit of effort during such a bloody period in our country.”In recent months, the Myanmar public’s cries for sanctions on gas revenues have grown thunderous. In August, activists launched the “Blood Money Campaign” movement, risking their lives by marching in the streets and carrying signs that read: “Freeze payments to junta and save Myanmar.” Others posted photos of themselves on social media holding signs that targeted the gas companies at the center of the debate: “Total, Chevron — Stop accessory to murder.”The United Nations’ top expert on human rights in Myanmar says millions of people across the country are imposing personal sanctions by withholding taxes, refusing to pay power bills and boycotting products linked to the military. And on Nov. 30, hundreds of civil society organizations in Myanmar joined their international colleagues in signing a letter asking Total's CEO to stop payments to military-controlled accounts.The AP also obtained a copy of a letter from workers at Yadana to their managers earlier this year calling on Total’s subsidiary, Total E&P Myanmar, to suspend export payments to the military, place the funds in a protected account and freeze income tax.“We are specifically concerned that the profits gained from Yadana Project, which we are working for, will, one way or another, help fund the military junta’s violent repression of Myanmar people,” the letter said.Total and Chevron say they condemn human rights abuses, but argue that sanctions could cause Myanmar's people further problems, such as cutting off electricity and making local gas workers vulnerable to military retaliation.Meanwhile, tolerance on the ground for global inaction has worn thin. Local armed groups, referred to as People's Defense Forces, have targeted bill collectors for the national utility and sabotaged buildings and infrastructure, according to EarthRights International, which works on environmental and human rights issues in Myanmar.Pro-sanctions activists don’t want to shut down the gas field itself. Instead, they want to sanction the project’s revenues and place them in a protected offshore bank account that the military can’t touch.The sanctions would target the state-owned Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), which is a joint venture partner in all offshore gas projects in Myanmar, including Yadana with Total, Chevron, and Thailand’s PTT Exploration & Production. Total has a majority stake in the venture and runs its daily operations, while MOGE collects revenues on behalf of the government. Gas from Yadana is piped to Myanmar and neighboring Thailand.Several smaller offshore gas fields operate in Myanmar’s waters, run by companies from Thailand, Japan, Malaysia, India and South Korea in partnership with MOGE. China is also an investor in the pipeline that delivers the gas to the country.About 50 percent of Myanmar’s foreign currency comes from natural gas revenues, with MOGE expected to earn $1.5 billion from offshore and pipeline projects in 2021-2022, according to a Myanmar government forecast. The Yadana gas project and pipeline is particularly important, earning around $400 million in revenues in 2017-2018.Yet despite the growing calls for action, neither U.S. President Joe Biden nor French President Emmanuel Macron have publicly moved against Myanmar’s oil and gas revenues. The current sanctions from the U.S. and European Union lean heavily on gemstones.The U.S. State Department did not directly address AP’s questions about why it has yet to impose sanctions on MOGE. Instead, the department pointed to a list of other people and entities the U.S. has already sanctioned, including several military officials and their family members, two army units believed responsible for a litany of atrocities, the military’s two largest holding companies and a state-owned gems enterprise.“We will not hesitate to take further action against those who perpetrate violence and suppress the will of the people,” the department said in a statement.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that the Biden administration is weighing tough new sanctions on Myanmar to pressure the country’s military leaders to restore a democratic path.An aide on the House Foreign Affairs Committee acknowledged that oil and gas make up “a huge chunk” of the military’s ability to maintain control. Despite that, a measure introduced in the House in October that specifically calls out MOGE as a potential sanctions target has yet to advance.The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the thinking around the legislation, said objections from Singapore and Thailand have played a role in the Biden administration’s hesitation to impose new sanctions, as has lobbying from Chevron. Activists have accused Singapore's banks of holding assets on the Myanmar military's behalf, although its central bank has said regular surveillance showed Myanmar companies and citizens did not have “significant funds” in the city state.In the first half of 2021, Chevron reported spending $3.7 million on federal lobbying in the U.S., with “Burma Energy Issues” and “Myanmar Energy and Investment Issues” listed as specific lobbying areas of focus.“It certainly seems in the U.S. there is a major lobbying campaign going on from Chevron to try and protect its interests,” said Chris Sidoti, a human rights lawyer and a member of the U.N. Fact Finding Mission on Myanmar from 2017 to 2019.In response to questions from the AP, a spokesman for Chevron pointed to an earlier statement from the company, which said Chevron would comply with any sanctions imposed by the U.S.“Any actions should be carefully considered to ensure the people of Myanmar are not further disadvantaged by unintended and unpredictable consequences of well-intentioned decisions,” Chevron wrote in its May statement.The French government also said it wants to avoid adding to the burdens of Myanmar civilians through sanctions and aims to target individuals from the junta rather than a vital economic sector. France wants to avoid normalizing relations with the junta but also wants to “stay involved on the ground” for humanitarian reasons, which requires “operational contacts” with Myanmar's administration, according to a senior official in the French president's office. He described the French government's thinking on condition of anonymity.He said Total's activities in Myanmar, including how it carries out payment for the gas, are the company's responsibility. Both the French government and Total want a return to a democratically elected government, “but at the same time you have to take into account the reality on the ground," he said.French authorities have told activists that Europe is expecting to impose a fourth round of sanctions by Feb. 1, the anniversary of the military’s takeover, and that both the energy and banking sectors are on the table.Total said in a statement that it is trying to keep its local employees safe from reprisals such as forced labor, and also to avoid further harm to Myanmar's population. Total also argues that it has to pay taxes and respect its contract legally, and that it will donate the equivalent of the taxes to human rights associations in Myanmar. Total cancelled exploration for new deposits in Myanmar after the military takeover.“The facts are that, in order to close off this source of revenue, the gas production should be brought to a stop,” the statement said. “Any cut to such supply of gas and, consequently, any risk of disruption to the supply of electricity must be considered in light of the consequences it could have on everyday life of local citizens."But several workers in Myanmar interviewed by AP dismissed concerns about their welfare, arguing the entire country is already oppressed. On Nov. 30, 789 civil society organizations — including 540 within Myanmar — sent a letter to CEO Patrick Pouyanne asking the company to “put an end to its complicity in crimes against humanity” by making payments to a holding account until democracy is restored. The letter argued that Total is now violating local laws against misappropriating public money and “has placed itself on the side of the junta.”MOGE can be targeted for sanctions without interrupting the flow of energy, said Tom Andrews, the United Nations special rapporteur on Myanmar.“The people of Myanmar are not calling for anything that they, themselves, are unwilling to do,” Andrews said in an e-mail to the AP. “But the fact remains that to be truly effective, the people of Myanmar need countries to join them and impose sanctions on MOGE.”Human rights activists say it’s unconscionable for any company to help fund a military that has, in recent months, engaged in mass torture, launched attacks on medics, forcibly disappeared thousands of people, and returned mutilated corpses to victims’ families as tools of terror. Since February, soldiers and police have killed at least 1,300 people and arrested more than 10,800, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors deaths and arrests.Last month, the National Unity Government, an underground opposition group and parallel administration, released a public statement that dubbed MOGE the military’s most important financial lifeline and called for urgent sanctions.“As a nation, we have these natural resources to build a school, to build a hospital, to build a road,” said spokesman Dr. Sasa, who goes by one name. “So why are we still using this money to kill the people of Myanmar? To us, it is barbarity.”In response to questions, the military said state revenue is used for education, infrastructure, development projects and public service, and is also used “proportionately for the rule of law and for defense.” The military has long denied allegations of human rights abuses.“All state revenue is spent according to the needs of the country,” the military said in a statement to the AP. "Putting restrictions on the current government is directly affecting the social and economic life of the citizens.”The Yadana project provides less than 1.5 percent of Chevron’s worldwide natural gas output, and Total says Yadana represents less than 1 percent of its production. But while Yadana isn’t a significant source of income, it also doesn’t cost the companies much because major set-up fees were incurred decades ago, said Readul Islam, a Singapore-based research analyst at Rystad Energy. Chevron and Total would also struggle to sell the operation, given the remaining short life of the aging gas field and the grim political situation, he said.“These operations are not company-makers by any sense, but they are profitable," Islam said.Also, Chevron and Total’s aversion to sanctions may be less about money than about precedent, said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch.“If you signal that every time a country has serious human rights abuses, Human Rights Watch and other groups can come in and say, ‘You should sanction your revenue,’ it’s going to create business headaches for them all over the world,” he said.With public pressure mounting, Total and Chevron announced in May that they were suspending dividend payments by the Moattama Gas Transportation Company, which owns the Yadana pipeline. While welcoming the move as a first step, activists argue the dividend payments are a fraction of the military’s gas revenues.The energy analytics firm Wood Mackenzie in November downgraded its forecast of Myanmar gas exports to Thailand after Yadana’s output fell faster than expected. Rights activists said Thai fears of a gas slowdown or cutoff at a time of surging prices across Asia have stiffened its resistance to new sanctions, which the U.S. and EU appeared reluctant to challenge. The Thai government did not respond with comment.In Myanmar, some gas workers have dismissed the energy companies’ concerns that they will face retaliation with sanctions. One 10-year employee of Total said the risk of losing his job due to sanctions was nothing compared to the risk of the generals remaining in power.“Everyone needs a job,” he said. “But I don’t want to survive by working here while everyone is suffering from this crisis.”Given he and millions of others already have risked so much in the pursuit of democracy, he is frustrated with the international community’s failure to act.“I don’t understand why they keep paying the junta,” he said.After the young woman whose family had long worked for Total protested outside its gates, the contractor company that hired her warned her not to participate again in the country’s pro-democracy Civil Disobedience Movement, she said.A few months later, she posted on social media about what she felt was Total’s poor treatment of a colleague who died of COVID-19. Days later, she said, the contractor company fired her for allegedly defaming Total. In a statement, Total said that no Total E&P employees have been fired since the military's takeover, and none have been prevented from participating in the Civil Disobedience Movement.In September, she was arrested and imprisoned for three weeks under Section 505(A) of the Penal Code, which, in part, criminalizes comments that “cause fear” or spread “false news.”“I feel very disappointed in Total because they are neglecting this country in which they invested,” she said.For another Total employee, the lack of action from those who claim to stand for human rights is baffling. Why he asked, hasn’t the international community told gas companies that if they do business with the military, they can no longer do business with the rest of the world?For him, the solution to military abuse is simple.“If they do not have revenue, they cannot buy weapons,” he says. “If they cannot buy weapons, this revolution will end quickly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-violence-myanmar-citizens-urge-gas-sanctions-to-stop-military-funding-101639550005730.html

Suddenly, an immediate guidance command came. Li Qunfeng, commander of the third battalion, put on gas masks, quickly passed through the poisoned zone, and then reported the situation to the command post, requesting the chemical defence detachment to help and decontaminate.”“The drill closely focused on the ‘enemy’ situation, focusing on key and difficult subjects such as day and night manoeuvring and multi-arms coordination, and tempered the firepower attack capability of the troops in complex environments,” the report added.The report carried photos of the exercise including one in which soldiers were wearing gas masks.In a report in November, the US department of defence said China is carrying out research in chemical and biological dual-use technology.“The PRC has engaged in biological activities with potential dual-use applications, which raise concerns regarding its compliance with the Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention (BWC) and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC),” the report said.“Studies conducted at PRC military medical institutions discussed identifying, testing, and characterising diverse families of potent toxins with dual-use applications.”“Based on available information, the US cannot certify that the PRC has met its obligations under the CWC due to concerns regarding the PRC’s research of pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs) and toxins with potential dual-use applications,” the US report added.The drill in November is likely to have been closely followed by the Indian defence establishment.It is part of the PLA’s continuous efforts to remain combat ready along the Sino-India border, where it is said to have deployed an unknown number of troops - estimates run into thousands - and heavy cache of advanced weaponry.The PLA has published how it has improved the facilities and living conditions for its border troops in high-altitude areas of Tibet and Xinjiang, indicating that they have been deployed for the long-run.Indian and Chinese militaries have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May, 2020, when a violent clash in Pangong lake area led to both sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border.Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.Soldiers were killed on both sides in a brutal fight on the night of June 15 at Galwan Valley.India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-pla-conducts-nuclear-chemical-biological-warfare-drill-in-tibet-101639551500287.html

Among them is barring fully vaccinated foreign nationals from travelling to the country, according to the outlet CBC News. Such travellers were allowed since September 7 this year. Similarly, while the government officially withdrew its advisory against non-essential travel by Canadian citizens and permanent residents outside the country this October, that is likely to make a comeback, according to the outlet CTV News.These moves are expected after Trudeau held an emergency conference call with premiers of Canada’s provinces and territories on Tuesday evening as Omicron threatens to disrupt the holiday season in the country.In an interview with the outlet Red FM on Tuesday, Justin Trudeau said, “This Omicron variant is scary. And it’s the last thing anyone needs, to have to worry, again, about another wave.”However, he added that with greater vaccination uptake including booster and paediatric doses along with health-related precautions, Canada would “make it through this winter and into a much better summer”.National Omicron figures were not provided, but the country’s most populous province Ontario reported that the variant now accounts for 30.8% cases of new daily infections with the doubling time at just three days. Ontario health officials expected the variant to account for nearly all new cases by January next year.More worryingly, the province’s Science Advisory Table placed the reproductive or R rate at 4.01, far higher than that for Delta, which was at 1.09.There were 4,336 fresh cases of all Covid-19 infections on Tuesday and Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam tweeted that eight provinces had reported higher numbers, making “for a national weekly increase of 30%”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-threat-canada-likely-to-announce-new-travel-guidelines-101639547719779.html
15-12-2021||World||Mark Meadows, ex-Trump chief of staff, held in contempt for defying Capitol riot probe||US lawmakers voted Tuesday to recommend criminal contempt charges against Donald Trump's former top aide Mark Meadows for refusing to testify before the congressional panel investigating the January 6 assault on the Capitol.The rebuke from the House of Representatives moves the ultra-conservative ex-congressman a step closer to becoming the first White House chief of staff to be prosecuted after leaving the post since H.R. Haldeman in the Watergate scandal nearly 50 years ago."We've given Mark Meadows every opportunity to cooperate. He's brought this situation on himself," the House January 6 select committee said in a statement ahead of the vote, which went roughly along party lines, with just two Republicans joining every Democrat to hold Meadows in contempt.The panel is investigating Trump's efforts to overturn his defeat in the November 2020 election in the run-up to the Capitol riot -- as well as the help he got from Meadows and others.Meadows, who served in the House for seven years before decamping to Trump's team in 2020, defied a subpoena requiring him to testify, pointing to an "executive privilege" claim by the Republican former president.That defense, which is theoretically only available to sitting presidents seeking to keep sensitive conversations with aides private, has already been shot down by a federal appeals court.The nine-member select committee, which voted Monday to advance the contempt case, says it is seeking answers about text messages and other communications that Meadows has already acknowledged are not privileged.Investigators say Meadows has given up any right to refuse testimony in any event, as he is promoting a new memoir that includes detailed accounts of January 6 and his conversations with Trump.He has also spoken numerous times about the attack in primetime appearances on Fox News.‘Dereliction of duty’During Monday's hearing, Cheney readout frantic messages sent to Meadows during the assault from three Fox News hosts, as well as administration officials, lawmakers, and the president's son Donald Trump Jr.Each begged Meadows -- unsuccessfully -- to get Trump to call off his supporters and put a stop to the violence."We need an Oval Office address. He has to lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out of hand," Trump Jr told Meadows.The messages made it clear that, contrary to their efforts since January 6 to downplay the assault, members of the former president's inner circle were appalled by the violence at the time."It's disappointing and unfortunately not surprising that some of the very same individuals who were willing to warn, condemn and express horror over what happened on January 6 in private were totally silent... or, even worse, were spreading lies and conspiracy theories," President Joe Biden's spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters.Cheney described the texts as evidence of Trump's "supreme dereliction of duty" during three hours of inaction during the assault when thousands of his supporters stormed the Capitol to stop the certification of Biden's election victory.In a further sign of the net tightening on figures accused of involvement in the Capitol assault, the Democratic attorney general for the US capital said Tuesday he was suing the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, blaming the far-right groups for the violence.The Meadows case is a federal issue, however, and the 62-year-old Florida native will have to sweat until the Justice Department decides whether prosecutors will take up the House referral.The department charged former White House strategist Steve Bannon with criminal contempt of Congress less than a month after the House voted to refer him.The Meadows decision may prove less straightforward than the case of Bannon, who was not working for the Trump administration at the time of the riot.Meadows' lawyer George Terwilliger said in a statement his client's refusal to cooperate did not amount to non-cooperation, but rather an effort to "honor" Trump's rejected privilege claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mark-meadows-ex-trump-chief-of-staff-held-in-contempt-for-defying-capitol-riot-probe-101639542519066.html
15-12-2021||World||J&J vaccine loses antibody protection against Omicron in lab study||Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine produced some antibodies but showed “no detectable” neutralization of the omicron coronavirus variant in a laboratory experiment, according to Penny Moore, a South African virologist. Moore, a professor at Johannesburg’s University of The Witwatersrand, said that laboratory experiments were conducted on blood plasma samples from people who had had two doses of the Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE vaccine and those or the J&J single-shot inoculation. Moore said the vaccine appears to provide some protection against omicron, perhaps via other means such as stimulation of immune cells.J&J didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.A measure of antibody levels, called geometric mean titers, fell from 1,419 against the original coronavirus strain to 80 against Omicron among people who received Pfizer shots. The same measure fell from 303 against the original strain to undetectable levels against omicron in those who had received J&J’s shot, Moore said in an online presentation on Tuesday.“Omicron does indeed exhibit substantial immune escape from antibodies,” she said. “The situation, I think, is even more alarming for the J&J vaccine -- there was no detectable neutralization in our assay.”Severe DiseaseThe as-yet-unpublished research Moore presented to an African health conference ties in with early experiments by South Africa’s Africa Health Research Institute and Pfizer’s own research. Omicron’s discovery was announced by South African scientists on Nov. 25.Still, Moore stressed, the body has other protection against the virus.“Reduced antibody titers will likely result in a decreased ability of vaccines to prevent infection but protection against severe disease likely to be preserved,” she said on one of her presentation slides.  J&J’s vaccine appears to be preventing severe disease in a study involving hundreds of thousands of South African health workers and no one on the study has died after being infected by the omicron variant, Glenda Gray, the co-lead of the study said in an earlier presentation on Tuesday.Discovery Health Ltd., the country’s largest medical insurance provider, said earlier today that a two-shot course of Pfizer’s vaccine appeared to offer 70% protection against being hospitalized after infection with the omicron variant. The shots made by Pfizer and J&J are the two currently being used in South Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jj-vaccine-loses-antibody-protection-against-omicron-in-lab-study-101639537015720.html

According to the Reuters news agency, both Beijing and Moscow also share similar approaches in foreign policy with respect to Iran, Syria and Venezuela, and recently revived a push to lift United Nations sanctions on North Korea.Also Read | Russia, China top agenda as G7 ministers call for unity against authoritarianismExtensive discussions on foreign policy, in view of rising global tensions on the Russia-Ukraine border, are likely to come up on Wednesday in the virtual meeting between Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed a day prior that the premiers will be discussing a host of international issues during the upcoming online meeting, including the “aggressive rhetoric” of NATO and the United States pertaining to Ukraine.“The situation in international affairs, especially on the European continent, is very, very tense, and of course, requires discussion between the allies, between Moscow and Beijing,” the Kremlin spokesman was quoted as saying by the Sputnik news agency. “We see very, very aggressive rhetoric, both from NATO and from the United States of America, this requires our discussion with the Chinese side.”According to Peskov, the two countries will also discuss regional issues, energy, and bilateral relations. It is to be noted that China had received significant amounts of coal from its northern neighbour amid a gruelling shortage in fossil fuel stocks this year, another indicator of the two nations warming up to each other in an effort to consolidate against the West's influence.Also Read | ‘US democracy weapon of mass destruction’: China lambasts global summitChina's foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin, on the other hand, did not reveal what the two premiers will discuss but said that full details of the meet will be released afterwards. “At the meeting, the two heads of state will give a full review of China-Russia relations and cooperation in various fields this year and make top-level designs for the development of bilateral ties next year,” he was quoted as saying.It is, however, not yet clear what Beijing's stance on Ukraine is, even though the situation at the border continues to heat up. Moscow has repeatedly refuted US allegations of preparing an invasion while expressing concerns about the transfer of NATO's military equipment near Russian borders and the increase in the number of Western instructors in Donbas. Russia has also said it has the right to move forces within its own territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xiputin-meet-lined-up-today-after-both-russia-china-left-out-of-biden-summit-101639531231867.html

China was not on the U.S. State Department's invited participants list."Losing a diplomatic ally is a very painful thing for us," Wu told reporters.China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Beijing has increased military and political pressure on Taiwan to accept its sovereignty claims, drawing anger from the democratically ruled island, which has repeatedly said it would not be bullied and has the right to international participation.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said the island would not bend to pressure or change its determination to uphold democracy and freedom."The more successful Taiwan's democracy is, the stronger the international support, and the greater the pressure from the authoritarian camp," she said in Taipei.China and Nicaragua's move to re-establish diplomatic ties will likely boost Beijing's influence in a part of the world long considered the United States' backyard, angering Washington.Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega first cut ties with Taiwan in 1985, but they were re-established with the island in 1990 under then-Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.Wu said all of his colleagues in the foreign ministry "put forth their greatest efforts to maintain these diplomatic ties."Nicaragua's move to cut ties with Taiwan leaves the island with just 14 formal diplomatic allies, most of them in Latin America and the Caribbean, plus a handful of small states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-target-our-allies-while-us-was-hosting-democracy-summit-taiwan-minister-101639529152044.html
15-12-2021||World||US Covid-19 death toll crosses 800,000||The United States, the country hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, crossed 800,000 Covid-19 deaths on Tuesday, a tracker maintained by Johns Hopkins University showed.The figure is greater than the entire population of several states, including North Dakota and Alaska.Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, who lead the House of Representatives and Senate respectively, as well as House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and other members of Congress held a moment of silence on the steps of the Capitol building Tuesday evening."On this day... we will remember that 800,000 loved ones did not make it this far: a lost father or grandfather, mother or grandmother, a friend, a familiar face in the neighborhood," Schumer said in a statement."All of us know of someone whom this disease has taken away."Around 450,000 of the deaths occurred in 2021, despite highly effective vaccines that were first authorized in December 2020 and widely available by springtime.The vast majority of the deaths have been among the unvaccinated.According to official data, the risk of dying from Covid-19 was 14 times higher among people who had not been fully vaccinated, compared to those who had, in September, the latest month analyzed.Vaccinations picked up during the fourth wave of the disease, driven by the Delta variant, and more than 60 percent of the country's 332 million people are now fully vaccinated -- though the United States still lags behind other wealthy nations.The country is now into its fifth wave, with the epicenter in colder northern states, as people gather more often indoors.Omicron, the latest variant of concern that has caused worldwide alarm since it was first reported in South Africa in late November, now accounts for around three percent of US cases, but that is expected to rise rapidly, as has been seen in other countries.Even if early data suggesting the variant causes milder illness in most people is confirmed, its increased transmissibility and ability to overcome prior immunity may negate this advantage, by infecting far more people.Health authorities are urging everyone over 16 to get a booster shot to restore immunity to levels comparable to two doses against earlier strains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-death-toll-crosses-800000-101639527726241.html
15-12-2021||World||Tesla faces barrage of US sex harassment lawsuits||Six women sued Tesla on Tuesday, alleging a culture of sexual harassment at the electric carmaker's California plant and other facilities that included unwanted touching, catcalls and retaliation for those who complained.The lawsuits -- filed within a month of two others -- add to the controversies centered on the Fremont factory in the San Francisco Bay area and which include a Black ex-employee being awarded $137 million in a racism case."Tesla's factory floor more resembles a crude, archaic construction site or frat house than a cutting-edge company in the heart of the progressive San Francisco Bay area," several of the suits claim.Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the complaints, which in at least one instance argued CEO Elon Musk's explicit or provocative tweets influenced the tone at the workplace.The six separate new suits filed Tuesday in a California court include five women who work or worked in the Fremont factory facilities, while one was employed in service centers in southern California.Michala Curran was 18 when she started her job at the Fremont plant and within weeks, her supervisor and co-workers were making explicit comments to her face about her body.One male co-worker sexually propositioned her, saying plant employees often had sex in the parking lot."After nearly two months of being sexualized at her first job out of high school, she could not take it anymore and decided to quit," her suit says, alleging "rampant sexual harassment at Tesla."SpaceX allegationsThe other cases were filed by Jessica Brooks, Samira Sheppard, Eden Mederos, Alize Brown and Alisa Blickman, who alleged in her lawsuit that she faced retaliation for reporting the misconduct."She was denied certain privileges and benefits that were afforded to women who did not object to supervisors' sexual advances and flirtations," Blickman's complaint says.Mederos, who worked in southern California Tesla service centers, said Musk tweets that reference sex or drugs inspired laughter and jokes among her co-workers."When Tesla launched the Model Y, Elon repeatedly pointed out that when one reads the Tesla Models S, 3, X and Y together, it spells 'SEXY,'" her suit said. "Some of Ms. Mederos' co-workers latched onto this, calling everything 'sexy.'"Echoing concerns in the lawsuits, a former engineer from Musk's SpaceX rocket firm has published an essay alleging she was sexually harassed at work."Men from the company found my Instagram account, messaging me to ask me out. One called my phone at 4:00 am. Another coworker came to my house and insisted on touching me even when I repeatedly requested we stay professional," wrote Ashley Kosak."I reported each incident of sexual harassment I experienced to HR, and nothing was done," she added.SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The series of lawsuits come after a California jury ruled in October that Tesla should pay a Black ex-employee $137 million in damages for turning a blind eye to racism the man encountered at the Fremont plant.Time magazine on Monday named Musk as its person of the year 2021, citing his embodiment of recent technological shifts but also troubling trends reshaping people's lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-faces-barrage-of-us-sex-harassment-lawsuits-101639525927891.html

"We've got one of the highest vaccination rates, which means we can fight this thing. We don't have to surrender to it."Australia has inoculated nearly 90% of its population above 16 with two doses and shortened the wait time for booster shots after the emergence of the Omicron cases.Morrison, who had been deemed a casual contact after attending an event last week along with a COVID-infected person, said he has been cleared to fly interstate to Queensland after negative test results."That's what living with the virus is," he said.Australia closed its borders in March 2020 in a bid to contain the spread of the new coronavirus and had limited the number of citizens and permanent residents allowed entry. The relaxation of border rules is expected to ease labour shortages, which threaten to hamper an economic rebound.The return of foreign students, who are worth about A$35 billion ($25 billion) a year to the Australian economy, will help businesses to fill many casual jobs. More than 235,000 foreigners, including about 160,000 students, held visas for Australia at the end of October, official data showed.The easing in travel rules comes as the state of New South Wales, home to Sydney, lifted most restrictions from Wednesday for the unvaccinated, despite a steady rise in Omicron infections after a staggered reopening.The state logged 1,360 new cases, the biggest daily rise in more than three months and since a nearly four-month lockdown ended in early October. Australia has recorded about 235,500 cases and 2,117 deaths since the pandemic began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/despite-omicron-worries-australia-reopens-borders-for-noncitizens-101639524656258.html

Giuffre was among many women who said Epstein sexually abused them when they were underage.Attorney Andrew Brettler has argued that the deal also shields Andrew from a separate claim brought against the prince by Giuffre this year.In a brief order issued Tuesday, US District Judge Loretta Preska said that absent any valid objection by Epstein’s estate, the document should be made public on or before Dec. 22 as part of Andrew's case.Preska said the court questions "whether any proper purpose would be served by the continued secrecy of the document save, perhaps, the dollar amount the settlement provided it for.”In the August lawsuit, Virginia Giuffre claims that the prince abused her on multiple occasions in 2001. Andrew has said he never had sex with her.Brettler has previously called the lawsuit “baseless."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/epstein-sex-scandal-judge-in-prince-andrew-suit-calls-for-unsealing-document-101639523902319.html

15-12-2021||World||Virus restrictions approved in UK but dissent worries Boris Johnson||British lawmakers voted Tuesday to approve new restrictions to curb the spread of the omicron variant, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced a major revolt by lawmakers in his own Conservative Party who are opposed to the regulations.The result was a blow to the authority of the embattled prime minister, whose approval ratings — both with voters and inside the party — have plunged amid ethics scandals and allegations that his government breached its own pandemic restrictions.The House of Commons voted on measures that take effect this week, ordering masks to be worn in most indoor settings in England, changing rules on self-isolation and — most contentiously — requiring proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test to enter nightclubs and large crowded events.All passed comfortably because of opposition party support, but 97 Conservatives voted against the nightclub rules, according to a House of Commons tally — by far the biggest rebellion of Johnson's premiership. It came despite Johnson imploring Tory legislators to back the measures in a private meeting just before the vote.Lawmaker Charles Walker, one of the rebels, called the vote “a cry of pain from the Conservative Party” that the prime minister must heed.Vaccine passes have become commonplace in many European countries, but Johnson’s government has resisted introducing them in England, although the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which set their own health rules, have done so.The British government argues that the highly transmissible omicron strain has changed the argument, and COVID passes for some venues are now a sensible measure, alongside booster vaccinations for all adults.“Omicron is a grave threat,” Health Secretary Sajid Javid told lawmakers, saying the strain was already estimated to be infecting 200,000 people a day in the UK.He said the nightclub rule was “not a vaccine passport” because people could also use a negative virus test to enter venues.Many Conservative legislators, however, argued that the new requirements were economically damaging and restricted individual freedoms.Former government minister Andrea Leadsom called the regulations “a slippery slope.” Conservative lawmaker Greg Smith argued that vaccine passes and mandatory vaccinations for health workers — another government policy — marked “a fundamental change in the relationship between citizen and state, and one to be resisted.”Other Conservatives argued vaccine passes would not slow the spread of the virus, because omicron appears more resistant to vaccines, while some accused the government of exaggerating the threat from the new variant.The opposition Labour Party, meanwhile, backed the rules. Labour health spokesman West Streeting said they were “a necessary response to the omicron threat.”“We can’t be sure about the severity of the omicron variant, but we can be certain that it’s spreading and spreading fast,” he said. "When people invoke the story of the boy who cried wolf — the warnings that came before but never materialized — people should remember that in the end there was a wolf.”As if to underscore omicron’s rapid spread, a handful of lawmakers missed the vote because they have COVID-19 and are in quarantine.The rebellion was a sign of growing discontent with Johnson in Conservative ranks. The party picked him to be leader in 2019 because he promised to “get Brexit done” after three years of gridlock over Britain’s departure from the European Union under Prime Minister Theresa May. The same promise helped Johnson win a December 2019 election with an 80-seat majority in the House of Commons, the biggest for any Conservative leader since Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.Since then the pandemic and a series of scandals have chipped away at the support for Johnson and his government. Johnson’s initial reluctance to impose a nationwide lockdown in early 2020 helped give the U.K. the highest coronavirus death toll in Europe apart from Russia, with more than 146,000 deaths.A successful vaccination program helped Johnson recover some of his authority, but his government has faced damaging allegations that it flouted the coronavirus rules it imposed on everyone else, including claims staff in Johnson’s 10 Downing St. office held lockdown-breaching Christmas parties last year. Johnson has ordered an inquiry, but insists he personally broke no rules.The government also faced charges of cronyism when it tried to block the suspension of a Conservative lawmaker found to have broken lobbying rules by advocating on behalf of two companies who were paying him. The government changed tack after an outcry and the lawmaker, Owen Paterson, resigned.A special election on Thursday to replace Paterson could add to Johnson’s woes. Polls suggest the opposition Liberal Democrats may take the seat from the Conservatives. Nationally, the Labour Party has opened up a lead in opinion polls.Since a national election is not scheduled until 2024, the danger for Johnson comes largely from his own party. The Conservatives have a long history of dumping leaders when they become unpopular.“Clearly, he is in trouble,” said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. “The question is whether that trouble is terminal or not."I doubt whether he is in any immediate danger — he will still be there by Christmas. But I think the new year will be an interesting few months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virus-restrictions-approved-in-uk-but-dissent-worries-boris-johnson-101639523129360.html
15-12-2021||World||Pfizer claims Covid pill Paxlovid drastically reduces disease severity||Pfizer said Tuesday that clinical trials confirmed its Covid pill -- a new type of treatment that should withstand the mutations seen with the Omicron variant -- drastically reduced hospitalizations and deaths among at-risk people by almost 90 percent.The announcement, which was praised by US President Joe Biden, came as a real-world study from South Africa showed two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 70 percent effective in stopping severe illness from the new strain.Pfizer said Tuesday that clinical trials confirmed its Covid pill -- a new type of treatment that should withstand the mutations seen with the Omicron variant -- drastically reduced hospitalizations and deaths among at-risk people by almost 90 percent.The announcement, which was praised by US President Joe Biden, came as a real-world study from South Africa showed two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 70 percent effective in stopping severe illness from the new strain.|#+|The sustained vaccine protection was called encouraging by the authors of the research, though it represents a drop compared to earlier variants.Data for the new pill came from more than 2,200 volunteers, and backed up preliminary findings announced last month.The American drugmaker said its treatment, which is called Paxlovid and has not yet been authorized by any country, also held up against the Omicron variant in lab testing."I am encouraged by the promising data released by Pfizer today, showing that its antiviral pill is effective at reducing the risk of severe illness in people infected with Covid-19," said Biden."This news provides another potentially powerful tool in our fight against the virus, including the Omicron variant."The US has ordered 10 million courses of the medicine, ahead of potential authorization by the Food and Drug Administration, which Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said could happen this month.The trial showed that the pill reduced the need for hospitalization in high-risk adults with Covid-19 by 89 percent if the treatment was given within three days of symptom onset and by 88 percent if given within five days.Overall, there were 12 deaths in the placebo group, and none in the drug group.Side effects occurred in about a quarter of people in both groups, and were mostly mild.- New type of drug - Paxlovid is a combination of two drugs -- nirmatrelvir, a new experimental medicine, and ritonavir, an existing antiviral used against HIV, both taken over five days.Because it does not target the fast-mutating spike proteins that stud the surface of the coronavirus, it should be more variant-proof than synthetic antibody treatments, as well as antibodies evoked by most types of Covid vaccine.Another Covid pill, Merck's molnupiravir, has already been authorized in Britain. A US panel of experts narrowly voted in favor of the Merck pill two weeks ago, but FDA authorization is still awaited.Final study results showed molnupiravir reduced hospitalizations and deaths by a modest 30 percent, and there were also safety concerns over how it actually works, which is different from the Pfizer pill.Merck itself recommended against molnupiravir's use in pregnant women after animal studies showed harm to fetuses.- Real-world vaccine data - The news comes as the heavily-mutated Omicron variant is spreading rapidly around the world, with the World Health Organization saying it is "probably" present in most countries.Even if early data suggesting that the variant causes milder illness in most people is confirmed, its increased transmissibility and ability to overcome prior immunity may negate this advantage, by infecting higher numbers of people.Many countries have stepped up their booster shot campaigns in a bid to restore vaccine efficacy.The latest research out of South Africa found that two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine still offered good protection against serious illness of 70 percent, though this was reduced from 93 percent during the country's Delta wave.The study was based on the results of 78,000 PCR tests taken in South Africa between November 15 and December 7.It also found two doses were 33 percent effective against infection -- a result that aligns with early research from Britain, which experts said underscored the case for a third dose.The British research found a third dose of Pfizer -- either after two earlier doses of Pfizer or two of AstraZeneca -- brought efficacy against infection back up to 70-75 percent.The South African research further confirmed reinfection risk is higher with Omicron, and a lower percentage of people infected with the new variant were hospitalized when compared to the country's first wave, after adjusting for vaccine status.bur-ia/sst||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-claims-covid-pill-paxlovid-drastically-reduces-disease-severity-101639522822905.html
15-12-2021||World||N. Korea, facing economic crisis, to convene parliament to discuss budget||The North Korean Supreme People's Assembly (SPA), the isolated state's rubber-stamp parliament, will convene on Feb. 6 to discuss government budgets and other issues, state media said on Wednesday as the country faces mounting economic woes.The North's parliament rarely meets and usually serves to approve decisions on issues such as governing structures and budgets that have been created by the state's powerful Workers' Party, members of which form the vast majority of the assembly.The agenda for February's meeting will include the work of the cabinet, government budgets, childcare legislation and "the law on the protection of the rights and interests of overseas compatriots," KCNA news agency reported.The decision to convene the parliament came at a plenary meeting of the SPA's standing committee on Tuesday, KCNA said.The standing committee was overseen by its chairman, Choe Ryong Hae, one of the most powerful officials under the country's leader, Kim Jong Un.The committee also discussed laws on construction design, property and river and ship transport, KCNA reported.North Korea's economy suffered its biggest contraction in 23 years in 2020 as it was battered by continued UN sanctions, COVID-19 lockdown measures and bad weather, South Korea's central bank has estimated.North Korea has not confirmed any COVID-19 cases, but closed borders and imposed strict prevention measures, seeing the pandemic as a matter of national survival.The UN special rapporteur on human rights in North Korea has said the country's most vulnerable people risk starvation after it slipped deeper into isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/n-korea-facing-economic-crisis-to-convene-parliament-to-discuss-budget-101639522803784.html
