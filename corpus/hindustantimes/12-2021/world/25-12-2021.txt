Chen Quanguo, who no longer serves as secretary of the Xinjiang Uigur Autonomous Regional Committee of the CPC, will be given another appointment, according to a decision by the CPC Central Committee,” a statement published by the Xinhua news agency said on Saturday.The move to replace Chen, who has earlier served as the party chief of Tibet, comes a day after US President Joe Biden signed a bill banning goods from Xinjiang unless companies can prove they aren’t made with forced local labour.Rights groups have alleged oppression of Uighur Muslims in a region that holds a major place in global supply chains.China has consistently denied such allegations.Xinjiang is a source for cotton used in clothing and is a key location for producing polysilicon used in solar panels, seen as crucial in the global shift away from fossil fuels. Chen has been accused by the US, the UK and the European Union of widespread human rights abuses against Uighurs, but he is tipped for a promotion, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on the development.The three Chinese officials sanctioned by the US last year were Chen, Zhu Hailun, the then party secretary of the Xinjiang Political and Legal Committee and Wang Mingshan, the party secretary of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau.China is battling allegations of human rights violations against Uighur Muslims in the last few years from the West.The allegations include incarceration of around 1mn people from minority Muslim communities in detention camps, forced labour in manufacturing units of the resource-rich Xinjiang, forced abortions, and mass indoctrination.Denying these allegations, Beijing says its security crackdown in Xinjiang is aimed at the separatist East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which is accused of fuelling terrorism and separatism in the region.Beijing says it had opened centres for vocational training and deradicalisation of people influenced by separatist forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sanctions-china-replaces-xinjiang-party-chief-amid-forced-labour-allegations-101640450068383.html
25-12-2021||World||As Omicron spreads, time to upgrade your mask. Why? Experts explain||The Omicron variant of coronavirus has been spreading across the world – as well as India – at an alarming pace. In just about of month of being confirmed in South Africa, the variant has affected people in more than 100 countries; in India, the tally has already crossed the 400-mark.Also Read | Why do vaccinated people too get Covid? Study explainsSo, it is time that people upgrade the “universal vaccine” against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) - the humble mask. Medical Analyst Dr Leana Wen, visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, told CNN that cloth masks "are little more than facial decorations", adding that there is no place for them in light of Omicron.What is the correct protection against the highly-mutated variant then? "We need to be wearing at least a three-ply surgical mask," Dr Wen said. "You can wear a cloth mask on top of that, but do not just wear a cloth mask alone."Erin Bromage, an associate professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, said that cloth masks can filter large droplets.Omicron started to spread across countries like wildfire soon after its detection in South Africa. The Indian government then warned about the decline in usage of face masks across the country.At a press conference on the Covid-19 situation, Dr VK Paul, Niti Aayog member (health), said that mask usage is declining in India and people are operating at a “risky and unacceptable” level, stressing that both masks and vaccines are important for protection against coronavirus disease (Covid-19).India has so far recorded more than 430 cases of Omicron, which has 37 mutations – more than any other variant of coronavirus. Due to so many mutations, it is believed to be more resistant to existing vaccines.Maharashtra is the biggest contributor to nationwide Omicron tally, followed by national capital Delhi. Rajasthan and Gujarat are jointly at number 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-omicron-spreads-time-to-upgrade-your-mask-why-experts-explain-101640440272240.html
25-12-2021||World||Tear gas fired as thousands march in Sudan in anti-coup rallies||Thousands of Sudanese protesters rallied Saturday two months on since a military coup, demanding soldiers "go back to the barracks" and calling for a transition to civilian rule.Waving flags, beating drums, dancing and chanting, crowds marched on the streets of Khartoum despite a heavy deployment of security forces -- who later fired tear gas canisters to break them up.Officers had earlier blocked bridges connecting the capital to suburbs, cut phone lines and restricted the internet ahead of the planned protests.At least 48 people have died in crackdowns during weeks of protests, according to the independent Doctors' Committee, and Khartoum's state governor has warned that security forces "will deal with those who break the law and create chaos".Demonstrators converged on the presidential palace in Khartoum, the headquarters of the military government in control since General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan seized power on October 25.Burhan held civilian leader Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok under effective house arrest for weeks, but reinstated him on November 21 under a deal promising elections for July 2023.The move alienated many of Hamdok's pro-democracy supporters, who dismissed it as providing a cloak of legitimacy for Burhan's coup.Protesters online had encouraged supporters with slogans, including demanding "no negotiations" with the army.As well as rallies in Khartoum and its suburbs, protesters also marched on the streets of Madani, a town around 150 kilometres (more than 90 miles) to the south, witnesses said.- Internet cut at dawn -Security forces with cranes used shipping containers to block the bridges across the Nile river connecting Khartoum to the cities of Omdurman and North Khartoum, and web monitoring group NetBlocks reported mobile internet was cut at sunrise on Saturday.Activists reported the arrest of several colleagues beginning Friday night, and Volker Perthes, the UN special envoy to Sudan, urged the authorities to "protect" the protests not to stop them."Freedom of expression is a human right," Perthes said Saturday, adding that it includes "full access" to the internet. "No one should be arrested for his or her intention to protest peacefully.""We draw the attention of the world and ask them to monitor what happens in Sudan on the issue of the revolutionary movement for freedom and democracy", said the Doctors' Committee, which is part of the pro-democracy movement.Khartoum's governor warned that "approaching or attacking buildings of strategic sovereignty is punishable by law".At rallies last Sunday, held on the third anniversary of mass demonstrations that led to the ouster of veteran strongman Omar al-Bashir, crowds began a "sit-in" protest outside the presidential palace.- Rape used as 'weapon' -Within hours, security forces dispersed the thousands of protesters with truncheons and firing tear gas canisters.Activists have condemned sexual attacks during those protests, in which the UN said at least 13 women and girls were raped.The European Union and the United States issued a joint statement Thursday condemning the use of sexual violence "as a weapon to drive women away from demonstrations and silence their voices".Sudan, one of the world's poorest countries, has a long history of military coups, enjoying only rare interludes of democratic rule since independence in 1956.Over 14 million people, a third of Sudan's population, will need humanitarian aid next year, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the highest level for a decade.Activists say more demonstrations are planned for December 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tear-gas-fired-as-thousands-march-in-sudan-in-anti-coup-rallies-101640437820569.html
25-12-2021||World||World's most powerful space telescope launched on quest to behold 1st stars||The world’s largest and most powerful space telescope rocketed away Saturday on a high-stakes quest to behold light from the first stars and galaxies and scour the universe for hints of life.NASA's James Webb Space Telescope soared from French Guiana on South America’s northeastern coast, riding a European Ariane rocket into the Christmas morning sky.The $10 billion observatory hurtled toward its destination 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away, or more than four times beyond the moon. It will take a month to get there and another five months before its infrared eyes are ready to start scanning the cosmos.We have LIFTOFF of the @NASAWebb Space Telescope! At 7:20am ET (12:20 UTC), the beginning of a new, exciting decade of science climbed to the sky. Webb’s mission to #UnfoldTheUniverse will change our understanding of space as we know it. pic.twitter.com/Al8Wi5c0K6First, the telescope’s enormous mirror and sunshield need to unfurl; they were folded origami-style to fit into the rocket's nose cone. Otherwise, the observatory won’t be able to peer back in time 13.7 billion years as anticipated, within a mere 100 million years of the universe-forming Big Bang.“It’s going to give us a better understanding of our universe and our place in it: who we are, what we are, the search that’s eternal,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said earlier this week.But he cautioned: “When you want a big reward, you have to usually take a big risk.”Intended as a successor to the aging Hubble Space Telescope, the long-delayed James Webb is named after NASA’s administrator during the 1960s. NASA partnered with the European and Canadian space agencies to build and launch the new 7-ton telescope, with thousands of people from 29 countries working on it since the 1990s.With the launch falling on Christmas and a global surge in COVID-19 cases, there were fewer spectators at the French Guiana launch site than expected. Nelson bowed out along with a congressional delegation and many contractors who worked on the telescope.Around the world, astronomers had eagerly waited to see Webb finally taking flight after years of setbacks. Last-minute technical snags bumped the launch nearly a week, then gusty wind pushed it to Christmas. Inside Launch Control, there was a smattering of Santa hats.“We launch for humanity this morning,” Arianespace CEO Stephane Israel said minutes before liftoff. “After Webb, we will never see the skies in quite the same way.”The telescope's showpiece: a gold-plated mirror more than 21 feet (6.5 meters) across.Protecting the observatory is a wispy, five-layered sunshield, vital for keeping the light-gathering mirror and heat-sensing infrared detectors at subzero temperatures. At 70 feet by 46 feet (21 meters by 14 meters), it’s the size of a tennis court.If all goes well, the sunshield will be opened three days after liftoff, taking at least five days to unfold and lock into place. Next, the mirror segments should open up like the leaves of a drop-leaf table, 12 days or so into the flight.In all, hundreds of release mechanisms need to work — perfectly — in order for the telescope to succeed. “Like nothing we’ve done before,” said NASA program director Greg Robinson.Retired astronaut-astronomer Steven Hawley is more stressed over Webb than he was for Hubble, which he released into orbit from space shuttle Discovery in 1990. That’s because Webb will be too far away for rescuing, as was necessary when Hubble turned out to have blurry vision from a defective mirror.Spacewalking repairs by astronauts transformed Hubble into a beloved marvel that has revolutionized humanity’s understanding of the universe, casting its eyes as far back as 13.4 billion years. It’s now up to Webb to draw even closer to the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, its infrared vision keener and more far-reaching than Hubble’s is in the shorter visible and ultraviolet wavelengths.NASA is shooting for 10 years of operational life from Webb. Engineers deliberately left the fuel tank accessible for a top-off by visiting spacecraft, if and when such technology becomes available.When he released Hubble, "I never would have believed that it would still be going strong almost 32 years later,” Hawley, now professor emeritus at the University of Kansas, said in an email. “I hope that in 32 years we’ll be able to say that JWST did as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-most-powerful-space-telescope-launched-on-quest-to-behold-1st-stars-101640435253488.html
25-12-2021||World||Russia blocks website OVD-Info that tracks political arrests||A Russian organization that tracks political arrests and provides legal aid to detainees said Saturday that government regulators blocked its website, the latest move in a months-long crackdown on independent media and human rights organizations.OVD-Info reported that Russia's internet and communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, blocked the group's website. The organization said in a tweet that it wasn't formally notified about the decision and doesn't know the reason for the action beyond that it was ordered by a court outside Moscow on Monday.OVD-Info gained prominence for its meticulous tracking and counting of arrests at street protests in Russia. Activists first started the practice during mass protests triggered by a 2011 Russian parliamentary election tainted by numerous reports of voter fraud and then formed a group that has continued the work over the years.The data has been indispensable to news outlets over the years as Russian authorities largely kept quiet or underplayed the scale of mass arrests at protests and demonstrations.OVD-Info operates as a legal aid group as well, dispatching lawyers to help detained protesters at police stations and in courts. In September, a Sweden-based international human rights organization awarded OVD-Info its Civil Rights Defender of the Year award.That same month Russian authorities designated the group as a “foreign agent” — a label that comes with excessive government scrutiny and strong pejorative connotations that can discredit recipients. OVD-Info's founders vowed to continue the organization's work despite the designation.Russian authorities have mounted pressure on rights groups, media outlets and individual journalists in recent months, naming dozens as foreign agents. Some were declared as “undesirable” — a label that outlaws organizations in Russia — or accused of links to “undesirable” groups.On Friday, Russia's Justice Ministry added two more rights groups to the registry of foreign agents: Coming Out and Revers, which advocate for LGBT rights and provide assistance to Russia's embattled LGBT community.Russian law mandates a non-governmental organization, a media outlet, an informal movement or an individual to be listed as a foreign agent for having received foreign funding — even a small donation from a foreign national counts — and engaging in loosely defined political activity.OVD-Info, together with other rights groups, launched a campaign in September to abolish the “foreign agents” law. As of late December, more than 240 organizations and over 260,000 individuals had signed a petition that describes the law as “discriminatory and unlawful.”OVD-Info submitted the signatures to Russia's lower parliament house, the State Duma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-blocks-website-ovd-info-that-tracks-political-arrests-101640430946719.html
25-12-2021||World||New research claims Omicron has cold-like symptoms, resembles parainfluenza||Amid the global spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, the scientists in the United Kingdom have said that its symptoms now match those of common cold. They have also urged the UK government to include more number of symptoms in its public health policy on the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The most common symptoms reported by UK scientists are running nose, headaches, fatigue, sneezing and sore throats. This is based on the analysis of confirmed cases in London, as listed on the Zoe Covid app.At least half of those reporting cold-like symptoms tested positive for Covid-19, according to a Guardian report on the analysis of data. But only half of infected users also reported on classic three symptoms – fever, cough or loss of smell or taste – the Guardian report further said.A committee of scientific advisers had also backed this analysis in a meeting on Thursday, saying that the loss of smell or taste seems to be reported less frequently.On Thursday, Dr Bruce Patterson, who works for single cell diagnostic company IncellDx, also claimed that he has not seen as much of a loss of taste and smell compared to the previous variants.He added that fatigue is present in Omicron-affected patients too, like in the cases of other coronavirus variants.Dr Patterson said that Omicron looked similar to a virus called parainfluenza.So far, Omicron is causing less severe strain, compared to early variants of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. A doctor in the United Kingdom has revealed a new Covid-19 symptom caused by the Omicron variant - really bad night sweats.Dr Amir Khan, a physician with the UK’s National Health Service, told The Sun last week about the "telltale sign" - the sweats which are "those kind of drenching night sweats where you might have to get up and change your clothes”.Omicron was detected in samples in South Africa on November 24. Since then, it has been confirmed in more than 100 countries. Omicron has 37 mutations, due to which it is believed to be more resistant to drugs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fresh-research-claims-omicron-has-cold-like-symptoms-looks-like-parainfluenza-101640427485954.html

The latest incident took place in hamlets like Ganjgaal, Sarkano and Kunar - in the Bajaur area - on Friday. Various reports in the local media and videos tweeted by journalists show both the sides firing at each other.According to some reports, the firing continued for 30 minutes on Friday afternoon.The firing started after a sniper, reportedly belonging to the Taliban, shot dead two Pak soldiers where a border fence was being installed. The Pakistani side fired at border hamlets in response, prompting retaliation from the Afghan side.Heavy clashes took place in the area, with a number of shells and artillery hitting the villagers, the local reports further said.Meanwhile, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Saturday claimed responsibility for the December 19 attack on federal minister Shibli Faraz in Darra Adam Khel in which his driver and bodyguard were injured.The latest border clashes come amid claims from both Taliban and Pakistan that they have resolved the recent row over border fencing by agreeing that further work on the project that led to a tense situation would be done through consensus.A senior official, who spoke to a group of journalists on Friday, said it had been decided at a senior level that fencing-related issues would in the future be dealt with through mutual agreement.The official, however, did not exactly specify at which level the talks between Pakistan and the de facto Afghan government were held after Wednesday’s incident in which Taliban fighters disrupted border fencing and took away spools of barbed wire, the Dawn newspaper reported.Pakistan has been fencing the 2600-kilometer-long border with Afghanistan since 2017 to end terrorist infiltration and smuggling despite very intense opposition from the neighbouring country, the report said.Besides the erection of a fence, the project also includes the construction of border posts and forts, and the raising of new wings of Frontier Corps, the paramilitary force that guards the border.The official said 90 per cent of the fencing had been completed.Fencing has been a contentious issue in Pakistan-Afghanistan ties because the Afghans dispute the border demarcation done during the colonial period.While Afghan Pashtuns define their country borders on basis of Durand Line, Pakistan is opposed to this demarcation.The differences over the status of the border have been so intense that they have in the past resulted in several fatal clashes between the troops of the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-troops-taliban-exchange-fire-along-durand-line-as-fencing-continues-101640426185783.html

Residents need special permission from their employer or local authorities to leave the city.Xi'an has recorded 330 locally transmitted symptomatic cases since the first case was reported on December 9 2021, few compared to outbreaks elsewhere in the world.But some 26 Xi'an government officials have been punished for lapses in virus prevention, China's disciplinary body said Friday.Local authorities who are deemed to have failed at controlling the virus in their region are regularly sacked or reprimanded under Beijing's strict zero-Covid approach.Cases from Xi'an have so far spread to five other cities including Beijing, according to state media, fuelling fears about how quickly the virus can spread geographically across the vast country.China has reported 100,871 symptomatic cases and fewer than 5,000 deaths since the virus first emerged in the city of Wuhan in late 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-biggest-daily-surge-in-covid-cases-in-4-months-amid-omicron-threat-101640421357326.html

25-12-2021||World||Omicron-free New Zealand celebrates Christmas without curbs||New Zealanders celebrated Christmas on Saturday in the warmth of mid-summer with few restrictions, in one of the few countries in the world largely untouched by the Omicron variant of Covid-19.Ninety-five percent of adults in New Zealand have had at least one dose of the vaccine, making it one of the world's most vaccinated populations. The only Omicron cases that have been found in New Zealand have been safely contained at the border.As Covid-19 spread around the world over the past two years, New Zealand used its isolation to its advantage. Border controls kept the worst of the virus at bay and by Christmas this year, New Zealand had recorded 50 deaths in a population of 5.5 million.The delta variant penetrated New Zealand’s defenses in August and its largest city, Auckland, was thrust into lockdown for 188 days. At its peak, the outbreak saw around 220 cases a day. Lately, the daily average has been around 50.But that success has come at a cost. There were empty chairs at some tables this holiday season because some New Zealanders living and working overseas have not been able to return home due to limits in the country's managed isolation and quarantine program.The traditional dining tables of a northern winter — turkey and all the trimmings — are common in New Zealand. But Kiwis also celebrate in an antipodean manner, with barbeques on beaches fringed by the native pohutukawa tree, which blooms only at Christmas.At New Zealand’s Scott Base in Antarctica, some New Zealanders enjoyed a white Christmas. During summer on the frozen continent, the sun never dips below the horizon and in 24 hours of daylight, the temperature hovers around 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit).Around 200 people pass through the base over the summer season — scientists, support staff, and Defense Force personnel who provide communications and other services. Numbers are lower this year because of the pandemic and all staff traveling to the continent have had to isolate and undergo Covid-19 testing before departure.“Adding a two-week isolation period and multiple Covid-19 tests to Antarctic pre-deployment is a big commitment for our people heading south this year,” Antarctica New Zealand chief executive Sarah Williams said. “But we want to ensure we’ve done everything we can to keep Antarctica Covid-19 free.”Most Pacific Island nations whose health systems might have been overwhelmed by Covid-19 outbreaks have largely managed to keep out the virus through strict border controls and high vaccination numbers.Fiji has an ongoing outbreak and has had almost 700 deaths. About 92% of the adult population is now fully vaccinated, 97.7% have received at least one dose and many in the deeply religious nation will celebrate Christmas at traditional church services and family gatherings.Health Secretary James Fong, in a Christmas message, urged Fijians to “please celebrate wisely.”In remote Macuata province, residents of four villages received a special Christmas present: Electricity was connected to their villages for the first time.Australia celebrated Christmas amid a surge of Covid-19 cases, worse than at any stage of the pandemic, which forced states to reinstate mask mandates and other preventative measures. The Omicron strain is prevalent in some states and is estimated to represent more than 70% of all new cases in Queensland.In his Christmas message, Prime Minister Scott Morrison referenced Covid-19's toll on society.“This pandemic, it continues to buffet us,” Morrison said. “The Omicron variant is just the latest challenge that we have faced. But together, always together and only together, we keep pushing through.”Summer heat might have discouraged outdoor Christmas feasts in some places. The temperature in Perth in Western Australia was expected to hit 42 Celsius on Saturday, making it the hottest Christmas since records began more than a century ago.On Christmas Eve, a student driver in the Northern Territory made off with a truck containing more than $10,000 in Christmas hams that were empty when it was found.“This behavior can only be described as Grinch-like,” police detective Mark Bland said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicronfree-new-zealand-celebrates-christmas-without-curbs-101640402458211.html
25-12-2021||World||'Let's Go Brandon': Caller taunts Biden during White House Christmas event||President Joe Biden was trolled by a caller Friday who said "Let's Go Brandon" -- a coded insult that has become a rallying cry for supporters of Donald Trump -- during a White House Christmas Eve event.The incident, which quickly went viral online, took place after Biden and First Lady Jill Biden spoke by video conference with North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) officials, who track Santa's travel across the globe.After being assured of St Nick's progress, the president fielded calls from several American families.One man identified himself as "Jared," a father of four. Biden spoke briefly with the caller's children, asking what presents they wanted for Christmas and telling them they needed to be in bed before midnight. He also remarked on how he and Jared both had sons named Hunter.Wrapping up the call, Biden wished Jared a "wonderful Christmas.""I hope you guys have a wonderful Christmas as well, Merry Christmas, and let's go Brandon!" Jared replied."Let's go Brandon, I agree," returned Biden, without reacting to the dig. It was not immediately clear if the president had understood the reference, though Jill Biden chuckled uncomfortably and rolled her eyes.Biden asked Jared where he was calling from, but by then the call had been disconnected. A clip of the moment spread widely on social media, with some praising the president for his calm response."Let's Go Brandon" is a euphemism for a vulgar insult that originated when a reporter at a NASCAR event misheard a chant of "F- Joe Biden" while interviewing driver Brandon Brown in September.Since then it has been taken up as a political slogan by supporters of Trump, Biden's predecessor.Trump had his own headline-grabbing Christmas Eve moment when, in 2018, he raised doubts about Santa's existence in a call with a seven-year-old boy."Are you still a believer in Santa Claus? 'Cuz at seven it's marginal, right?" he said.The Santa tracker presented by NORAD dates to 1955, when a Colorado newspaper advertisement misprinted a phone number to connect children with Santa and mistakenly directed them to the military nerve center hotline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lets-go-brandon-caller-taunts-biden-during-white-house-christmas-event-101640400727427.html
25-12-2021||World||Omicron spread: 108 countries and over 1.5 lakh patients in a month||The Omicron variant, which was first reported last month from South Africa, has fuelled thousands of cases worldwide and forced governments to impose stricter restrictions including travel bans.The speed with which Omicron infections have spread can be gauged from the fact that in just one month 108 countries have reported 151,368 cases and there have been 26 deaths.The first case of Omicron was reported on November 24 in South Africa and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a variant of concern within a couple of days as experts said it has an unusually high number of mutations that could make it more transmissible and even result in immune evasion.South AfricaIn South Africa, Delta was responsible for only 2 per cent of new cases in early May, rising to 89 per cent by July 12. On the other hand, the first case of Omicron was detected on November 24 and as of December 13, the latest variant has become a major variant in South Africa. At present, data shows there are 95 per cent of Omicron cases in the country.BritainIn Britain, only 0.10 per cent of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases were due to Delta as of April 5, which increased to 74 per cent by the end of May. By June, the Delta variant was behind more than 90 per cent of the Covid-19 cases.Also read | Omicron fallout: Over 4,000 flights cancelled world over on Christmas weekendNow, coronavirus infections in the UK have broken records within a month due to Omicron. More than 1 lakh new cases were reported in the UK on December 22, the highest ever in a single day.USThe Delta variant was behind 0.31 per cent of all coronavirus disease cases in the United States by April 19 and by the end of June, the figure had risen to 50 per cent. One month later, by the end of July, Delta was responsible for more than 90 per cent of the cases. Also read | Variant watch: UK govt study backs lower Omicron severity riskMeanwhile, the rate of infection in the US has risen sharply since Omicron was reported in the country. As of December 22, every fourth case in the US is due to Omicron.IndiaCases of the Delta variant started appearing in India by the end of December 2020. In the first month, only 0.73 per cent of the total cases were of the Delta variant but Omicron has spread to 17 states in just 22 days. The first case of Omicron came to light on December 2 in India and there are 358 cases of this variant in the country. India has not reported any deaths in this category yet.GermanyDelta was responsible for 0.69 per cent of the cases when the variant was first detected in Germany. However, the Omicron variant has been responsible for 9 per cent of the total Covid-19 cases in this European country in just a few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-spread-108-countries-and-over-1-5-lakh-patients-in-a-month-101640398862101.html
25-12-2021||World||South Africa to stop contact tracing as 80% have some immunity||South Africa will stop coronavirus contact tracing and won’t ask those who’ve been directly exposed to infected people to quarantine, indicating a shift away from tough restrictions to contain the pandemic.Authorities in Africa’s most-industrialised nation will only try and track the spread of the disease in a cluster outbreak, the nation’s director-general of health said in a circular dated Thursday. As much as 80% of the population has some sort of immunity from prior illness or vaccines, the department said.“Containment strategies are no longer appropriate -- mitigation is the only viable strategy,” Sifiso Buthelezi said in the missive. “Quarantine has been costly to essential services and society as many people stay away from their work and thus lose their income.”While South Africa’s contact tracing has been negligible compared with many countries outside the continent, the move still represents a change in approach even as the highly transmissible omicron variant continues to rage. The government declared a state of disaster when the coronavirus arrived in March 2020 and has followed an alert level-based system of curbs depending on the prevalence of infections ever since.The rationale provided for the strategy change “is that the quarantine process does not have a major effect in terms of chains of transmission and is difficult to implement and sustain,” Adrian Puren, acting executive director of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, said in an e-mailed response to questions. The shift may also be influenced by South Africa’s push to recover from its deepest economic contraction in at least a quarter-century last year. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict gross domestic product will expand 4.9% in 2021, compared with a previous estimate of 5.1%, partly due to travel bans that followed omicron’s emergence. The nation’s official jobless rate is at a record of almost 35%, with a lack of major sports and entertainment events restricting even informal work.Omicron was identified by scientists in South Africa and Botswana last month, and the region has been the front runner in the latest phase of the global pandemic. Yet there are positive indications that the variant does not lead to the same extent of severe illness and death as previous incarnations, and the South African government has held off toughening containment measures as a result.Those contracting Covid-19 in the current fourth wave of infections are 80% less likely to be hospitalized compared with other strains, according to a study released by the NICD this week. Meanwhile, there are indications the surge may already have peaked in some areas, with the reproductive rate -- or the number of people to which each infected person passes on the virus -- falling below one in Gauteng, omicron’s original epicenter.  That may be affected by the time of year, which sees many migrant workers and holidaymakers travel out of Johannesburg and Pretoria to rural and coastal areas. The seven-day rolling average of new confirmed infections in the country has slumped to less than 17,000 from a peak of more than 23,000 on Dec. 18, although that data may also be skewed by reporting lags over the holiday seasons and the rationing of tests. Just over 9,200 Covid-19 patients are currently hospitalized, about half the number during the height of previous waves. “The initial data show that inland provinces have reached a peak and Gauteng has a sharp decline in cases,” Puren said. “It does not mean that we are over the fourth resurgence as there is still accumulation of cases and the coastal provinces have not reached their peak infections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-to-stop-contact-tracing-as-80-have-some-immunity-101640397099197.html
25-12-2021||World||Christmas celebrations subdued in Bethlehem for 2nd year due to Covid-19||In Bethlehem's Manger Square, visitors in Santa hats and scouts beating drums marked Christmas Eve on Friday, but numbers were lower than usual as coronavirus fears overshadowed celebrations for a second straight year.The city where Christians believe Jesus was born is usually a focal point of the holiday, with thousands packing the streets and filling hotels.But Israel, which controls all entrances to Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank, barred its borders to foreigners in an effort to rein in infections from the Omicron strain of the coronavirus."It's very strange," said Kristel Elayyan, a Dutchwoman married to a Palestinian, who came to Bethlehem from Jerusalem."Before (the pandemic), you had a bunch of people coming in from different countries to celebrate Christmas, and now you know that everybody who is here is probably not a tourist."Last year, Bethlehem curtailed celebrations sharply because of the pandemic, with a virtual tree lighting and just a handful of visiting scouts.This year, the celebrations were more vibrant -- but still a fraction of their usual size."If it's one year, it's an interesting experience," Elayyan said of the pandemic. "But because this is the second year and we don't know what is going to come in the future, it's a huge loss for the people here."Local visitorsAn upbeat Palestinian tourism minister, Rula Maayah, said it was "thanks to the vaccines" that Bethlehem was celebrating again.In his homily for midnight mass celebrated in St Catherine's Church in Bethlehem, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem Pierbattista Pizzaballa said it was encouraging that celebrations were "certainly more joyful this year"."Compared to last year's Christmas, the participation is much greater and this is an encouraging sign," he told the masked congregation, but regretted the absence of foreign worshippers due to the pandemic."We pray for them and at the same time ask for their prayers, so that all this may end soon and that the city of Bethlehem may once again be full of pilgrims."On average, Bethlehem welcomed three million visitors a year before the pandemic, with Christmas alone drawing 10,000 people to the city's hotels, around half from abroad.The municipality said it worked this year to appeal to local visitors from Palestinian communities across the Holy Land.Some hotels were busy, but about a quarter of available rooms citywide were shuttered because of the pandemic, said Elias Arja, head of the Palestinian Hotel Association.Several businesses kept their doors shut on Friday, despite Christmas Eve being the most important day of the year for many in Bethlehem.Inside the Church of the Nativity, visitors were even able to meditate nearly alone at the grotto where Jesus is said to have been born."Surreal," observed Hudson Harder, a 21-year-old American student at Hebrew University in Jerusalem."Of course, there is a selfish part where it's like, 'Oh, I get to see this place so empty' but on the other hand you feel for the shops, all the money they are losing."'Worse than war'Steps away from the basilica, images of Popes John Paul II and Francis covered the front of a shop selling carved olive wood figures and nativity scenes.Owner Victor Epiphane Tabash said it was his 57th Christmas behind the counter. For him, as for many shopkeepers around Manger Square, "there is nothing to say about Christmas"."Only the scouts give a bit of the holiday feeling," he said, as the uniformed groups marched past, blasting out Christmas carols on drums, trumpets and bagpipes.Tabash said he kept his business alive during the pandemic by exporting because no customers came to buy in person. He compared the pandemic to two previous Palestinian uprisings, or intifadas."We have lived through the intifadas, wars. But the coronavirus is worse," he said.Outside, Maram Saeed, a Palestinian woman from Jerusalem, took a selfie with her husband and two children in front of a towering Christmas tree decorated with shining red and gold spheres.Saeed said it was a time of joy after many days of depression."It's not like a usual year, we have the fear of the worst, we still fear Covid," she told AFP."When there is war, we know the enemy, and we know who we are fighting. But with Covid, it's a very tiny enemy that we don't see, so it's worse."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/christmas-celebrations-subdued-in-bethlehem-for-2nd-year-due-to-covid19-101640395549117.html
25-12-2021||World||Indian-origin judge appointed to South Africa's highest judicial bench||Narandran 'Jody' Kollapen, who is of Indian origin, has been appointed to South Africa's highest judicial bench, the Constitutional Court.President Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday announced the appointment of 64-year-old Kollapen and Rammaka Steven Mathopo as the latest additions to the Constitutional Court after a lengthy process of public interviews.Kollapen and Mathopo were among the five candidates recommended to Ramaphosa in October this year for the two vacancies.Both will take office from January 1, 2022.Kollapen was interviewed twice before for appointment to the Constitutional Court but was unsuccessful then despite having served two terms as an acting judge of the same institution.The Presidency said Kollapen and Mathopo have illustrious careers in the legal profession and the judiciary.Kollapen, who has now been elevated from his position as a judge of the high court, started legal practice in 1982, focussing largely on public interest work. He joined Lawyers for Human Rights in 1993 and went on to become its national director in 1995, serving in that position until the end of 1996.In 1997, he took up a post as commissioner of the South African Human Rights Commission and went on to serve as chair of the commission for seven years from 2002 until 2009. He was appointed as chair of the South African Law Reform Commission in April 2016.Kollapen serves on the structures of numerous NGOs and community-based organisations, including the Legal Resources Centre, the Foundation for Human Rights, and Laudium Care Services for the Aged.He has also been invited to speak on human rights issues across the world, including at the United Nations and Harvard University.He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Durban University of Technology; the Turquoise Harmony Institute's award for his contribution to society in the area of law and human rights; and a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Congress of Business and Economics, which was born out of the erstwhile Transvaal Indian Congress from the days when Mahatma Gandhi was in South Africa.In 2010, while in the position of acting Constitutional Court judge, Kollapen made a strong statement about cultural and national identity as the keynote speaker at the 50th-anniversary celebrations of the religious organisation Siva Gnana Sabhay in Lenasia.Kollapen said there was no need to shy away from the unique Indian identity, culture, and religion brought to South Africa by the first indentured labourers 150 years earlier, but that South Africans of Indian origin should use this to help build the rainbow nation as citizens of the country.Kollapen's mother was among the women in the historic protest march to the Union Buildings in Pretoria, the seat of the apartheid-era government, in 1956 to protest discriminatory laws. She was arrested and jailed twice for her participation in passive resistance protests.Kollapen often recalled how his mother had told him that she was pregnant with him at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianorigin-judge-appointed-to-south-africa-s-highest-judicial-bench-101640394661127.html
25-12-2021||World||James Webb telescope, successor of Hubble, set to be most powerful observatory ever sent into space||James Webb Space Telescope, a revolutionary instrument designed to provide mankind with the first-ever glimpse into an infant universe as it existed when the earliest galaxies are believed to have been formed, will be launched on Saturday by Nasa.The device, which the National Aeronautics and Space Administration hails as the “premiere space-science observatory of the next decade”, is set for launch on December 25, from the northeastern coast of South America, according to an official statement.If all goes according to plan, the French-built Ariane 5 rocket will blast off from the European Space Agency (ESA)'s launch base in French Guiana at 1220 GMT (5:50pm Indian Standard Time) with the telescope bundled inside its cargo bay area.After a 26-minute ride into space, the rocket will release the 14,000-pound instrument, which will then unfurl to nearly the size of a tennis court.What is the James Webb Space Telescope?Named after James Edwin Webb, the chief of the American space agency during most of the agency's formative decade of the 1960s, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is planned to succeed the Hubble Space Telescope as Nasa's flagship astrophysics mission.The new space telescope is about 100 times more sensitive than its predecessor, Hubble, and is expected to profoundly transform scientists' understanding of the universe and our place in it.With improved infrared resolution and sensitivity, the JWST will enable a broad range of investigations across the fields of astronomy and cosmology, including observing some of the most distant events and objects in the universe, such as the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterisation of potentially habitable exoplanets.The telescope will also help astronomers better study supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies, and planets orbiting other stars in our galaxy. More specifically, astronomers will be able to study for the first time ever the “dark ages” of the universe, the history of which remains mostly unknown.When is the launch?The JWST is scheduled for lift-off on the back of the Ariane flight VA256 at 5:50pm IST on Saturday – Christmas Day – from a European-managed spaceport in South America's French Guiana. The launch window will stretch for over half an hour to ensure that there are no last-minute errors or technical snags.Nasa will run a live stream on its YouTube channel beginning at 4:30pm, and on its Twitter and Facebook accounts as well beginning at the same time. Moreover, the European Space Agency will also be running its own live stream in French and Spanish languages on its website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/james-webb-telescope-successor-of-hubble-set-to-be-most-powerful-observatory-ever-sent-into-space-101640389184130.html
25-12-2021||World||Greece: 13 dead, others missing in new migrant boat accident in Aegean Sea||At least 13 people died after a migrant boat capsized in the Aegean Sea late Friday, bringing to at least 27 the combined death toll from three accidents in as many days involving migrant boats in Greek waters.The sinkings came as smugglers increasingly favor a perilous route from Turkey to Italy, which avoids Greece’s heavily patrolled eastern Aegean islands that for years were at the forefront of the country’s migration crisis.The coast guard said 62 people were rescued after a sailboat capsized late Friday some 8 kilometers (5 miles) off the island of Paros, in the central Aegean. Survivors told the coast guard that about 80 people had been on the vessel.Five coast guard patrol boats, nine private vessels, a helicopter and a military transport plane continued the night-time search for more survivors, authorities said, while coast guard divers also participated.Smugglers based in Turkey increasingly have packed yachts with migrants and refugees and sent them toward Italy.Earlier, 11 people were confirmed dead after a sailboat Thursday struck a rocky islet some 235 kilometers (145 miles) south of Athens, near the island of Antikythera. The coast guard said Friday that 90 survivors ‒ 52 men, 11 women and 27 children ‒ were rescued after spending hours on the islet.“People need safe alternatives to these perilous crossings,” the Greek office of the United Nations Refugee Agency, UNHCR, said in a tweet.In a separate incident Friday, Greek police arrested three people on smuggling charges and detained 92 migrants after a yacht ran aground in the southern Peloponnese region.And a search operation also continued for a third day in the central Aegean, where a boat carrying migrants sank near the island of Folegandros, killing at least three people. Thirteen others were rescued, and the survivors reported that at least 17 people were missing. Authorities said the passengers originally were from Iraq.Greece is a popular entry point into the European Union for people fleeing conflict and poverty in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. But arrivals dropped sharply in the last two years after Greece extended a wall at the Turkish border and began intercepting inbound boats carrying migrants and refugees ‒ a tactic criticized by human rights groups.More than 116,000 asylum-seekers crossed the Mediterranean to reach EU countries this year as of Dec. 19, according to UNHCR. The agency said 55% traveled illegally to Italy, 35% to Spain, and 7% to Greece, with the remainder heading to Malta and Cyprus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greece-13-dead-others-missing-in-new-migrant-boat-accident-in-aegean-sea-101640390348643.html
25-12-2021||World||Omicron fallout: Over 4,000 flights canceled world over on Christmas weekend||Commercial airlines around the world canceled more than 4,300 flights over the Christmas weekend, as a mounting wave of Covid-19 infections driven by the Omicron variant created greater uncertainty and misery for holiday travelers.Airline carriers globally scrapped at least 2,366 flights on Friday, which fell on Christmas Eve and is typically a heavy day for air travel, according to a running tally on the flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. Nearly 9,000 more flights were delayed.The website showed that 1,616 Christmas Day flights were called off worldwide, along with 365 more that had been scheduled for Sunday.Commercial air traffic within the United States and into or out of the country accounted for more than a quarter of all the canceled flights over the weekend, FlightAware data showed.Among the first US carriers to report a wave of holiday weekend cancellations were United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which scrubbed nearly 280 flights combined on Friday alone, citing personnel shortages amid the surge of Covid-19 infections.Covid-19 infections have surged in the United States in recent days due to the highly transmissible variant Omicron, which was first detected in November and now accounts for nearly three-quarters of US cases and as many as 90% in some areas, such as the Eastern Seaboard.The average number of new US coronavirus cases has risen 45% to 179,000 per day over the past week, according to a Reuters tally.New York reported more than 44,000 newly confirmed infections on Friday alone, shattering that state's daily record. At least 10 other states set new one-day case records on Thursday or Friday.Rising hospitalizations were hitting healthcare systems especially hard in the US Midwest, with intensive care units in Indiana, Ohio and Michigan bracing for the worst even as they remain under pressure from an earlier wave of Delta variant cases.In Britain, many industries and transport networks were struggling with staff shortages as sick workers self-isolated, while hospitals have warned of the risk of an impact on patient safety.One in 20 Londoners had Covid-19 last week, a figure that could rise to one in 10 by early next week, according to data released on Thursday by the Office for National Statistics. https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/one-10-londoners-likely-infected-with-covid-ons-models-2021-12-24Government data showed a record tally of 122,186 new infections nationwide on Friday, marking a third day in which the number of known cases has surpassed 100,000.While recent research suggests Omicron produces milder illness, and a lower rate of hospitalizations, than previous variants of Covid-19, health officials have maintained a cautious note about the outlook."There is a glimmer of Christmas hope ... but it definitely isn't yet at the point where we could downgrade that serious threat," Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, told the BBC.France hit another Covid-19 infection record on Friday, with its daily tally exceeding 94,000 while hospitalizations from the virus reached a seven-month high, prompting the government to convene a special meeting for Monday that could trigger new public health restrictions.Despite the uncertainties and grim news around the world, millions of Americans carried on with travel plans through a second pandemic-clouded holiday season.Moses Jimenez, an accountant from Long Beach, Mississippi, flew to New York with his wife and three children, even though the latest torrent of coronavirus cases dashed their hopes of catching a Broadway performance of "Hamilton" or visit some museums."Hamilton" was one of a dozen productions to cancel shows this week as cast and crew members tested positive for Covid-19. Museums were scratched from the family's itinerary because many now require proof of vaccination and the two younger children are ineligible for the shot.Instead, Jimenez, 33, said his brood will make the best of roaming the city's streets and parks, while also seeing relatives and friends."We just wanted to get out of the house, really, get the kids out to the city for Christmas," Jimenez told Reuters on Thursday at New York's LaGuardia Airport.New York planned to sharply limit the number of people it allows in Times Square for its annual outdoor New Year's Eve celebration, in response to the surge of new coronavirus cases https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-york-city-scale-down-new-years-eve-celebrations-times-square-2021-12-23, capping the number of attendees 15,000.The Biden administration will next week lift travel restrictions on eight southern African countries imposed last month over concerns about the Omicron variant, the White House said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-fallout-over-4-000-flights-canceled-world-over-on-christmas-weekend-101640388978794.html

The Kremlin reiterated on Friday that it reserves the right to move its own forces on Russian territory as it sees fit and that Western countries were carrying out provocative military manoeuvres near its borders.US, European and Ukrainian leaders have accused Russia of building up troops again near Ukraine’s border since October after an earlier brief buildup in April, when Maxar also released images. US President Joe Biden and other leaders say Moscow appears to be weighing an attack on Ukraine as soon as next month, something Moscow has repeatedly denied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-expect-us-answer-on-security-guarantees-next-month-101640386048185.html

Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.“The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in profound reductions in the department’s visa processing capacity,” it said in a statement. “As global travel rebounds, we are taking these temporary steps to further our commitment to safely and efficiently reduce visa wait times while maintaining national security as our priority.”The consular officers will now be temporarily authorised to waive in-person interviews for nearly a dozen visa categories, including Persons in Specialty Occupations (H1B visas), visas for students, temporary agricultural and non-agricultural workers, student exchange visitors, as well as athletes, artists and entertainers.The state department also said it has extended indefinitely the authorisation to waive the in-person interview for applicants renewing a visa in the same visa class within 48 months of the prior visa’s expiration.US state department in March 2020 had suspended all routine visa services in most countries due to the pandemic. While the services have been reinstated with a limited capacity and on a priority basis, months-long wait times for certain visa appointments persist due to a massive backlog.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-waives-in-person-visa-interviews-in-a-bid-to-cut-wait-times-101640385810447.html

Passengers were required to be vaccinated and they were tested before leaving last Saturday, according to Carnival.“Carnival Freedom is following all protocols and has a small number on board who are in isolation due to a positive Covid test," the statement said. “Our protocols anticipate this possibility and we implement them as necessary to protect the health and safety of our guests and crew."Ashley Peterson, a passenger on the ship, tweeted a photo of a Dec. 22 letter from the ship's captain apologizing for being unable to make the stops in Aruba and Bonaire. The letter said passengers would get $100 per room in onboard credit and refunds for excursions planned at the two stops.“We know these unexpected changes are disappointing and impact your cruise vacation, however we trust you understand this is outside our control," said the letter from Capt. Mario Imbimbo.It was the third outbreak this week affecting cruise ships operated by Carnival and Royal Caribbean departing Miami and Fort Lauderdale ports.Meanwhile, Florida had 26,811 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, the second-highest daily number since the start of the pandemic in the US in March 2020, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The highest was in last August when 27,802 cases were reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/carnival-freedom-hit-by-covid-19-3rd-florida-based-cruise-ship-to-report-cases-this-week-101640370746838.html
