If the Security Council indeed takes over the responsibility on this issue, a few states will then have a free-hand in deciding on all climate-related issues. This is clearly neither desirable nor acceptable.”India is “second to none” when it comes to climate action and climate justice but the UN Security Council was not the platform for them.“Today’s UNSC Resolution attempts to undermine the hard-won consensus which we reached in Glasgow,” Tirumurti said, referring to the last UN climate change meet. “This resolution would only sow the seeds of discord among the larger UN membership.”The Indian ambassador to the UN went on to say that the draft resolution “sends a wrong message to the developing countries that instead of addressing their concerns and holding developed countries responsible for meeting their commitments under the UNFCCC, we are willing to be divided and side-tracked under the guise of security”.The way forward instead was to provide affordable access to climate finance and technologies. “Developed countries must provide climate finance of $1 trillion at the earliest. It is necessary that climate finance be tracked with the same diligence as climate mitigation. And the reality, Mr President, is that the developed countries have fallen well short of their promises.”Developed countries had committed decades ago to contribute to a climate fund of $100 billion every year to support climate action in developing countries and they have not yet met the target - the latest available data for 2018 is $79 billion.“This is particularly important to recognise because today’s attempt to link climate with security really seeks to obfuscate lack of progress on critical issues under the UNFCCC process,” said Tirumurti.The ambassador listed out India’s commitment as laid out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Glasgow meet: India will take its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030; it will meet 50% of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030; it will reduce the total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from now till 2030; cut carbon intensity of its economy by less than 45%; and achieve Net Zero goal by 2070.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/calling-it-divisive-india-votes-against-unsc-draft-resolution-on-climate-change-101639416909654.html

The market value of Tesla's crossed $1 trillion in 2021, surpassing Ford Motor and General Motors combined, in terms of value, according to a report by Reuters. Musk also overtook Amazon founder and another space exploration enthusiast Jeff Bezos in valuation.“The richest man in the world does not own a house and has recently been selling off his fortune. He tosses satellites into orbit and harnesses the sun; he drives a car he created that uses no gas and barely needs a driver.

13-12-2021||World||China reports 1st Omicron case, outbreak of Delta subvariant||The first case of the Omicron Covid-19 variant infection in the mainland was detected in the northern city of Tianjin on Monday night, health authorities said.The infection was discovered in a traveller who arrived in the city from overseas on December 9, Chinese official media reported, adding that the patient is currently being treated in isolation in a city hospital.Separately, a sub-strain of the Covid-19 Delta variant has triggered a new cluster of cases in eastern China’s industrial powerhouse province of Zhejiang, causing many of the 190 cases in a week, locking down more than 500,000 residents and shutting down factories.Several infections diagnosed until Monday afternoon were of the Delta strain sub-lineage AY.4, prompting large-scale travel restrictions in the province, mass nucleic acid tests with more 52,000 people sent to centralised isolation.Zhejiang reported a total of 192 locally transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms during the December 6-13 period, official numbers showed on Monday, marking the province’s first domestic cluster outbreak this year.“The whole-genome sequencing and analysis found that the cases in the three cities (Hangzhou, Ningbo and Shaoxing) were caused by the Delta strain sub-lineage AY.4. It is more transmissible and carries a higher viral load than the original novel coronavirus, said an official with the Zhejiang provincial centre for disease control and prevention,” official news agency Xinhua reported.“Local authorities have imposed restrictions on public gatherings and travelling out of the province to prevent the virus from spreading further,” the report said.“The province has brought a total of 540,430 people under quarantine control, of which 52,824 were in centralized isolation, 21,835 were under home health observation, and 465,771 were under routine health monitoring,” a state media report said.More than a dozen Chinese-listed companies said they had suspended production in coronavirus-hit parts of China’s eastern Zhejiang province in response to local government’s tightened Covid-19 curbs, causing their share prices to plunge, Reuters reported on Monday.China reported 80 new locally-transmitted cases with symptoms on the mainland for December 12, including 74 identified in Zhejiang.Separately, the city of Manzhouli, located at China-Russia border, in north China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has reported 537 local cases during the latest resurgence.Of these, 507 were undergoing treatment, and 25 were discharged from the hospital.China has reported a total number of 99,681 Covid-19 cases and 4,636 deaths from the infection. The national health commission (NHC) on Monday said that more than 2.61 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses had been administered in the country as of Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-1st-omicron-case-outbreak-of-delta-subvariant-101639403229330.html
13-12-2021||World||UK reports its first Omicron death as variant continues to spread rapidly||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday confirmed the first death due to the Omicron variant of coronavirus as Britain expanded its booster programme for all aged 30 and above. Johnson told reporters that “at least one patient has been confirmed to have died with Omicron”. The confirmation comes amid reports of the new variant of concern causing mild disease as compared to the Delta, which is currently the dominant strain globally.The World Health Organization said in a technical briefing that Omicron is more transmissible than the Delta strain and reduces vaccine efficacy but causes less severe symptoms. The UN health agency report stated that the Omicron variant has been detected in at least 63 countries as of December 9."So I think the idea that this is somehow a milder version of the virus - I think that's something we need to set on one side - and just recognise the sheer pace at which it accelerates through the population," Johnson said.UK's National Health Service expanded its vaccine booster programme from Monday after the country's health security agency found that the additional dose of the Covid vaccine significantly restores protection against mild disease caused by Omicron. But users are facing issues with the booking system amid high demand for booster shots.“The COVID vaccine booking service is currently facing extremely high demand so is operating a queueing system. For users aged 18-29, please be aware that booking opens on Wednesday 15 Dec. For all others experiencing waits, we would advise trying again later today or tomorrow,” UK NHS wrote on Twitter.Meanwhile, a new modelling study has projected up to 74,800 deaths in the United Kingdom by April 2022 due to the Omicron variant. The study suggests that Omicron has the potential to cause a wave of transmission that could lead to a higher number of infections and hospitalisations than during January 2021 if no additional control measures are implemented over and above the current ‘Plan B’ policy in England.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-reports-its-first-omicron-death-as-variant-continues-to-spread-rapidly-101639396788515.html
13-12-2021||World||Study projects up to 75,000 deaths in UK by April end due to Omicron, boosters may not be enough||The Omicron variant of coronavirus could cause between 24,700 to 74,800 deaths in the United Kingdom by April end, according to a new modelling study. The researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine suggest that the new variant of concern, which was first identified in South Africa, has the potential to cause a wave of transmission that could lead to a higher number of infections and hospitalisations than those witnessed during January 2021 in the event of no additional control measures over and above the current ‘Plan B’ policy in England.The researchers have projected the levels of infections, hospital admissions and Covid-related death for all scenarios based on the measures taken by the government. Citing the “most optimistic scenario” which includes low immune escape and high effectiveness of boosters, the study suggests that the wave of infection from Omicron could witness a peak of over 2,000 daily hospital admissions. It has projected 175,000 hospitalisations and 24,700 deaths by April 30, 2022, for this scenario.In case of high immune escape of Omicron and lower effectiveness of boosters, the wave of infection could lead to a peak in hospital admissions around twice as high as the peak seen in January 2021. The researchers, considering the most pessimistic scenario, have projected 492,000 hospitalisations and 74,800 deaths by April. They estimate stronger measures may be required to keep the peak of hospital admissions due to Omicron below the January 2021 peak.“In our most optimistic scenario, the impact of Omicron in the early part of 2022 would be reduced with mild control measures such as working from home. However, our most pessimistic scenario suggests that we may have to endure more stringent restrictions to ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed,” Dr Rosanna Barnard, the co-author of the study, said in a statement.“Mask-wearing, social distancing and booster jabs are vital, but may not be enough,” Barnard added.The study is yet to be peer-reviewed and currently available in preprint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-projects-up-to-75-000-deaths-in-uk-by-april-end-due-to-omicron-boosters-may-not-be-enough-101639391225420.html

"I assure the nation that no-one will leave our office with any reason to be upset."He appealed to people to stay away until the office is operational again."I am really sorry about this, I am upset because people are facing hardship. They're wasting their money and standing here uselessly," Haqqani said."The office is closed, our systems are not operational."A number of provincial passport offices are still open and officials in Kabul are processing around 2,000-3,000 passports from these offices each day, he said, but it was still unclear when the Kabul office would reopen.As well as the equipment issues, Haqqani said officials were working on stamping out corruption and rooting out the so-called 'Commissionkar' - commission agents who promise to ensure swift treatment of applications for a fee."We have arrested bribe takers, from inside and outside the office," he said. "We will use any possible way to clean the country of bribe takers everywhere."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-passport-office-head-urges-patience-as-anxious-crowds-keep-gathering-101639373883888.html
13-12-2021||World||Two weeks into Omicron outbreak: What do we know so far||The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has been found in 63 countries so far and will surpass Delta in spreading speed, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said.“As of December 9, 2021, cases of human infections with this variant have been identified in 63 countries across all six WHO regions," a statement by the WHO said.The United Nations health agency said, based on preliminary data, the Omicron variant might reduce the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines but added that this strain is less dangerous than Delta.WHO designated variant B.1.1.529 a variant of concern on November 26. Is Omicron spreading fast?According to the WHO, Omicron appears to have a growth advantage over Delta. “It is spreading faster than the Delta variant in South Africa where Delta circulation was low, but also appears to spread more quickly than the Delta variant in other countries where the incidence of Delta is high, such as in the United Kingdom,” it said.The reproduction rate of Omicron in Gauteng, where South Africa’s outbreak is currently centred, is over 3, which means that every infected person on average infects three more. Cases in South Africa are rising at a near-record pace, and the rate of increase has outstripped South Africa’s three earlier waves.Also read | Israel imposing travel ban for Britain, Denmark, Belgium over Omicron spreadAccording to a study in Japan, Omicron is 4.2 times more transmissible than delta. Epidemiologist John Edmunds has said the mutated virus may be spreading faster in England than in South Africa, with cases in the UK possibly topping 60,000 a day by Christmas, according to Bloomberg.Are infections severe? Doctors have reported Omicron patients with fatigue and headaches and little more in a contrast to racing pulse rates and respiratory problems in those infected with the Delta variant.South Africa’s three biggest private hospital operators say cases are much milder than in earlier waves. There are few people on oxygen or ventilators and only a slight uptick in deaths.Also read | Omicron cases in India at 38; 6 states and 2 Union territories report infections“There are still limited data on the clinical severity of Omicron. While preliminary findings from South Africa suggest it may be less severe than Delta, and all cases reported in the EU/EEA to date have been mild or asymptomatic, it remains unclear to what extent Omicron may be inherently less virulent. More data are needed to understand the severity profile,” according to WHO.Do vaccines work against Omicron?Research has shown that Omicron is able to largely, but not completely, evade the antibodies generated in response to the inoculation. A study by Pfizer has also backed this up.“Preliminary evidence, and the considerably altered antigenic profile of the Omicron spike protein, suggests a reduction in vaccine efficacy against infection and transmission associated with Omicron,” WHO also said.Also read | UK raises Covid alert level as Omicron advances“There is some preliminary evidence that the incidence of reinfection has increased in South Africa, which may be associated with humoral (antibody-mediated) immune evasion,” it added.In addition, preliminary evidence from a few studies of limited sample size has shown that sera obtained from vaccinated and those previously infected had lower neutralisation activity than with any other circulating variant of concern and the ancestral strain.Does it affect children differently?Initial hospital admissions in South Africa saw a higher number of children under the age of 5 than previously. However, most only stay in hospital for a short time, and according to South African health minister Joe Phaahla, there are no reports of respiratory complications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-weeks-into-omicron-outbreak-what-do-we-know-so-far-101639374136574.html
13-12-2021||World||Alibaba fires woman who accused boss of rape in #MeToo setback||Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has fired a woman who accused a manager of sexual assault, a surprise move that came just months after China’s e-commerce leader admitted bungling its initial response to the allegation.The employee surnamed Zhou told the Dahe Daily Alibaba had terminated her for spreading false information in August about being raped by a senior manager. She didn’t get any severance and was compensated up to the date of termination on Nov. 25., according to a screenshot of an official memo and an interview with Zhou published by the central Chinese newspaper.Zhou’s termination caps a months-long scandal that played out across social media and ignited intense debate about the excessive drinking perpetuated by Chinese corporations and discrimination against women at tech firms. The employee touched off a furor in August when she published an 8,000-word account accusing her manager and a client of sexual assault after an alcohol-fueled dinner during a work trip. Her account -- including a video of her handing out leaflets while shouting at the top of her voice in the company cafeteria -- went viral and turned China’s No. 2 company into the highest-profile symbol of abuses regarded as prevalent throughout businesses and tech firms, the by-product of an environment that often prioritizes achievement over culture. The Alibaba manager surnamed Wang was fired and two senior executives at the e-commerce giant resigned as Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang called the company’s handling of the incident a “humiliation.”Alibaba spokespeople didn’t respond to calls and emails seeking comment on the report. Zhou wasn’t immediately available for comment.Public debate around her accusations has so far been freely allowed online, an unusual concession for a country that’s fiercely censored previous #MeToo discourse, including tennis star Peng Shuai’s allegation she was coerced into sex by a senior government official. Posts carrying the hashtag “Female Alibaba employee fired” had attracted more than 680 million views as of Monday morning.    Zhou’s firing provoked a broad range of responses on social media over the weekend, with those decrying her termination vying against others who pointed to inconsistencies in her account that came to light during a police investigation. “This was blown out of proportion and caused severe harm to Alibaba and society,” one post read. Others questioned Alibaba’s move. “As an internet giant, what Alibaba did was inconsiderate. Firing the woman caused new problems. Why didn’t Alibaba reflect on its own management flaws?”In September, prosecutors dropped their case against Wang, saying he wouldn’t face criminal charges. Wang’s behavior didn’t constitute a criminal offense and he was held under the category of just “forcible indecency,” which carried a maximum penalty of 15-days detention, they said.Police reports also appeared to refute elements of Zhou’s account, including her assertion she’d found an open pack of condoms under her bed. The report re-ignited debate around Zhou’s account, splitting public opinion about the extent to which she was a victim.Alibaba in recent months has taken a hard line against information leaks associated with the case. It dismissed 10 staffers for leaking her accusations, people familiar with the matter said at the time. The company felt they violated very strict policies against exposing content carried on employee forums, the people said.While many details of the incident remain unclear, Zhou’s ordeal has triggered what many say is a long overdue examination of the ways Chinese women are too often treated at work: overlooked, objectified, forced to take part in male-dominated rituals like drinking with clients and brushed aside when reporting abuse.Zhou told the Dahe Daily she received many messages from women saying they too had been sexually assaulted and forced to drink in the workplace, but most stayed quiet to avoid repercussions.Alibaba has since moved to establish better protections for its employees. It’s created a hotline and a team of senior women executives dedicated to investigating sexual harassment complaints. In a commentary about the incident, the Communist Party’s anti-corruption watchdog warned that “under the table rules” such as forced drinking for business purposes may lead to crimes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alibaba-fires-woman-who-accused-boss-of-rape-in-metoo-setback-101639368187860.html

13-12-2021||World||US tornadoes: 8 factory workers dead, 8 missing at Kentucky factory||Eight people are confirmed dead at a Kentucky candle factory that was hit by a tornado and another eight remain missing, but dozens more have been accounted for, a company spokesman said Sunday, raising hope that the toll from a Midwest twister outbreak won't be as high as first feared.While officials initially said 40 of 110 workers at Mayfield Consumer Products had been rescued, spokesman Bob Ferguson said more than 90 people had now been located.While eight remained missing, there was hope they might be OK.“Many of the employees were gathered in the tornado shelter and after the storm was over they left the plant and went to their homes,” he said.“With the power out and no landline they were hard to reach initially. We're hoping to find more of those eight unaccounted as we try their home residences.”Workers on the night shift at Mayfield Consumer Products were in the middle of the holiday rush, cranking out candles, when a tornado closed in on the factory and the word went out: "Duck and cover.”Autumn Kirks pulled down her safety goggles and took shelter, tossing aside wax and fragrance buckets to make room. She glanced away from her boyfriend, Lannis Ward, and when she looked back, he was gone.On Sunday, he was among scores of people feared dead in the rubble of the factory and elsewhere across the state.Gov Andy Beshear initially warned Sunday that the state's overall death toll from the outbreak of twisters Friday night in Mayfield and other communities could exceed 100. But later in the day, he said the number might turn out to be half that, citing details from the candle company.“We are praying that maybe original estimates of those we have lost were wrong. If so, it's going to be pretty wonderful," the governor said.Kirks and others could only wait in agony for news of their loved ones amid the rescue effort.“Not knowing is worse than knowing right now," she said. "I'm trying to stay strong. It's very hard right now.”Kentucky was the worst-hit state by far in an unusual mid-December swarm of twisters across the Midwest and the South that leveled entire communities and left at least 14 people dead in four other states.Forty people who were inside the candle factory were pulled out soon after the twister struck, authorities said. The number of people who had been in the factory was initially put at 110. Rescuers had to crawl over the dead to get to the living at a disaster scene that smelled like scented candles.But by the time churchgoers gathered Sunday morning to pray for the lost, more than 24 hours had elapsed since anyone had been found alive. Instead, crews recovered pieces of peoples' lives — a backpack, a pair of shoes and a cellphone with 27 missed messages were among the items.Layers of steel and cars 15 feet deep were on top of what used to be the factory roof, the governor said.“We're going to grieve together, we're going to dig out and clean up together, and we will rebuild and move forward together. We're going to get through this," Beshear said. “We're going to get through this together because that is what we do.”Four twisters hit the state in all, including one with an extraordinarily long path of about 200 miles (322 kilometres) long, authorities said. The outbreak was all the more remarkable because it came at a time of year when cold weather normally limits tornadoes.Eleven people were reported killed in and around Bowling Green alone.“I've got towns that are gone, that are just, I mean gone. My dad's hometown — half of it isn't standing," Breshear said of Dawson Springs.He said that going door to door in search of victims is out of the question in the hardest-hit areas: “There are no doors.”“We're going to have over 1,000 homes that are gone, just gone,” the governor said.With afternoon high temperatures forecast only in the 40s, tens of thousands of people were without power. About 300 National Guard members went house to house, checking on people and helping to remove debris. Cadaver dogs searched for victims.Kirks said she and her boyfriend were about 10 feet apart in a hallway when someone said to take cover. Suddenly, she saw sky and lightning where a wall had been, and Ward had vanished.“I remember taking my eyes off of him for a second, and then he was gone. I don't know where he went, don't have any idea,” she said.Kirks was at a ministry center where people gathered to seek information about the missing.“It was indescribable,” Pastor Joel Cauley said of the disaster scene. “It was almost like you were in a twilight zone. You could smell the aroma of candles, and you could hear the cries of people for help. The candle smells and all the sirens is not something I ever expected to experience at the same time.”The outbreak also killed at least six people in Illinois, where an Amazon distribution centre in Edwardsville was hit; four in Tennessee; two in Arkansas, where a nursing home was destroyed and the governor said workers shielded residents with their own bodies; and two in Missouri.Debris from destroyed buildings and shredded trees covered the ground in Mayfield, a city of about 10,000 in western Kentucky. Twisted sheet metal, downed power lines and wrecked vehicles lined the streets. Windows were blown out and roofs torn off the buildings that were still standing.In the shadows of their crumpled church sanctuaries, two congregations in Mayfield came together on Sunday to pray for those who were lost. Members of First Christian Church and First Presbyterian Church met in a parking lot surrounded by rubble, piles of broken bricks and metal.“Our little town will never be the same, but we're resilient,” Laura McClendon said. “We'll get there, but it's going to take a long time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-tornadoes-8-factory-workers-dead-8-missing-from-at-kentucky-factory-101639358715359.html

However, sceptics have argues its vulnerability to cyber attacks.The Dubai Crown Prince said the government plans to implement advanced strategies to create and enhance digital life in Dubai over the next five decades."The new phase of Dubai's digital journey will enable and empower future governments to meet the expectations of the residents of a thriving smart city and provide them with renewed opportunities for prosperity, sustainable development, and happiness," he said.The Dubai Paperless Strategy was implemented in five consecutive phases, each of which enlisted a different group of the Dubai Government's entities.By the end of the fifth phase, the strategy was fully implemented across all 45 government entities in the emirate.These entities provide more than 1,800 digital services and over 10,500 key transactions.Collaboration and integration among participating entities enabled the automation of processes and services provided to customers, cutting paper consumption by more than 336 million papers, the statement added.The strategy also helped save more than 1.3 billion Dirham (USD 350 million) and over 14-million-man hours across the Dubai Government.The complete digital transformation in the Dubai Government will enrich the smart city experience for all residents, entirely removing the need for paper transactions and documents – be they handed out to customers or exchanged between employees across government entities.Digitalisation will also help provide exceptional experiences for residents through the DubaiNow application, which allows access to more than 130 smart city services in 12 major categories, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubai-world-s-first-govt-to-go-100-paperless-crown-prince-101639339711428.html
