The White House similarly said it’s discussing the proposals with U.S. allies and partners, but notes that all countries have the right to determine their future without outside interference.The publication of the demands — contained in a proposed Russia-U.S. security treaty and a security agreement between Moscow and NATO — comes amid soaring tensions over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that has raised fears of an invasion. Moscow has denied it has plans to attack its neighbor, but is seeking legal guarantees precluding NATO expansion and deploying weapons there.Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia’s relations with the U.S. and NATO have approached a “dangerous point,” noting that alliance deployments and drills near Russia have raised “unacceptable” threats to its security.Moscow wants the U.S. to start talks immediately on the proposals in Geneva, he told reporters.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had received the Russian documents, and noted that any dialogue with Moscow “would also need to address NATO’s concerns about Russia’s actions, be based on core principles and documents of European security, and take place in consultation with NATO’s European partners, such as Ukraine.”He added that the 30 NATO countries “have made clear that should Russia take concrete steps to reduce tensions, we are prepared to work on strengthening confidence building measures.”White House press secretary Jen Psaki noted that strategic security talks with Moscow go back decades, adding that “there’s no reason we can’t do that moving forward to reduce instability, but we’re going to do that in partnership and coordination with our European allies and partners.”“There will be no talks on European security without our European allies and partners,” Psaki said. ”We will not compromise the key principles on which European security is built, including that all countries have the right to decide their own future and foreign policy free from the outside interference."President Vladimir Putin raised the demand for security guarantees in last week’s video call with U.S. President Joe Biden. During the conversation, Biden voiced concern about a buildup of Russian troops near Ukraine and warned him that Russia would face “severe consequences” if Moscow attacked its neighbor.U.S. intelligence officials say Russia has moved 70,000 troops to its border with Ukraine and is preparing for a possible invasion early next year. Moscow denies any intention to attack and accused Ukraine of planning an offensive to reclaim control of rebel-held eastern Ukraine — an allegation Kyiv has rejected.Fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine began after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. It has killed over 14,000 people and devastated Ukraine’s industrial heartland, known as the Donbas.The Russian demands would oblige Washington and its allies to pledge to halt NATO's eastward expansion to include other ex-Soviet republics and rescind a 2008 promise of membership to Ukraine and Georgia. The alliance already has firmly rejected that demand from Moscow.The demands also would preclude the U.S. and its allies from setting up military bases in Ukraine, Georgia and other ex-Soviet nations that aren't members of NATO.The proposal also contains a new demand to roll back NATO troops deployments in Central and Eastern Europe, stating that the parties agree not to send any troops to areas where they hadn't been present in 1997 — before NATO's eastward expansion started — except for exclusive situations of mutual consent.Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999, followed in 2004 by Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and the former Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In the following years, Albania, Croatia, Montenegro and North Macedonia also became members, bringing NATO membership to 30 nations.The draft proposals contain a ban on the deployment of U.S. and Russian warships and aircraft to “areas where they can strike targets on the territory of the other party.”Moscow has long complained about patrol flights by U.S. strategic bombers near Russia's borders and the deployment of U.S. and NATO warships to the Black Sea, describing them as destabilizing and provocative.Russia's draft also envisages a pledge not to station intermediate-range missiles in areas where they can strike the other party’s territory, a clause that follows the U.S. and Russian withdrawal from a Cold War-era pact banning such weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-sets-out-tough-demands-for-security-pact-with-nato-101639755352588.html

The rest are due to arrive in the next few months and will be looked after and integrated into Italian society by the Catholic Sant' Egidio charity group.The first group included doctors and information technology workers in their native countries, among others.The pope will provide for 50 migrants to resettle in Italy as part of a deal between Italy, the Vatican and Cyprus to commemorate his trip earlier this month to the Mediterranean island.Francis, who was elected the first pontiff from Latin America in 2013, has made defence of migrants and refugees a cornerstone of his pontificate.Ethnically-divided Cyprus, the closest European Union member state to the Middle East, has struggled to manage an influx of migrants and refugees in the past two years.Many asylum seekers access the southern government-controlled areas through the "Green Line" splitting the island after previously arriving in the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in its north.The pope also visited Greece during the Dec. 2-6 trip, including a stop at a refugee camp on the island of Lesbos.During a previous visit in 2016, he left Lesbos, then at the frontline of Europe's migration crisis, taking 12 Syrian refugees with him. (Reporting by Philip Pullella; Editing by Susan Fenton)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/migrants-help-pope-francis-celebrate-85th-birthday-101639757458887.html

The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing the work.Questions have centered on alleged harassment and discrimination in the workplace, according to the emails. Conversations have taken place as recently as last month, one of the sources said.The DFEH declined to comment.Google said it is focused on "building sustainable equity" for its Black workers and that 2020 was its largest year for hiring what it calls "Black " workers, a designation inclusive of people belonging to multiple races."Our goal is to ensure that every employee experiences Google as an inclusive workplace," it said. "We’ll continue to focus on this important work and thoroughly investigate any concerns, to make sure our workplace is representative and equitable."The DFEH has interviewed workers who have filed formal complaints and those who have not, the people said, showing that the regulator has sought more examples of potential mistreatment.The agency is involved in ongoing lawsuits against video game companies Tencent Holdings' Riot Games and Activision Blizzard Inc alleging widespread discrimination and harassment.But its cases do not always result in charges.For years Black men in the tech industry have said they have faced disparaging comments and discouraging experiences, such as being shut out of offices because security guards and colleagues questioned whether they actually worked there.As more Black women have joined the workforce, such complaints have increased. Seven current and former Google employees told Reuters this year about being marginalized on projects as Black women and not taken as seriously as colleagues with different backgrounds.Artificial intelligence researcher Timnit Gebru has said Google fired her a year ago for criticizing its lack of workforce diversity and for fighting managers who objected to publishing a critical paper she co-wrote. Erika Munro Kennerly, who oversaw diversity and strategy teams at Google before resigning last year, told magazine Corporate Counsel in January that "there's an overall tone of being undervalued" as a Black woman at Google.Workers identifying as "Black female" left Google at the highest rate of any racial-gender group other than "Native "American female" last year, according to company data. Google last year said it planned to boost retention by increasing support staffing and programs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-state-probes-google-s-treatment-of-black-female-workers-101639742596926.html
17-12-2021||World||12 dead as Typhoon Rai strikes the Philippines||A powerful typhoon that battered the central Philippines left at least 12 people dead in massive floods that trapped residents on roofs and damaged buildings including a hotel and an airport, officials said.Typhoon Rai slightly weakened after slamming ashore Thursday on the country's southeastern coast but still packed destructive and deadly winds of 150 kilometres (93 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 205 (127 mph). Meteorologists said it was moving away into the South China Sea on Friday.Officials were assessing the damage and casualties wrought by one of the strongest typhoons to hit the country in recent years but said efforts were hampered by widespread power outages, downed communications and roads clogged with fallen trees and debris.Witnesses described ferocious winds that ripped off roofs and forced down trees.“I have never experienced such ferocity of the wind in my life and we were not even directly hit,” Mayor Jerry Trenas of central Iloilo city told The Associated Press by telephone, adding that at least one resident was killed when she was hit by a cluster of bamboo blown down by the storm on her hut.Workers were clearing roads in the coastal city of nearly half a million people, which remained without power and struggled with erratic cellphone signals, he said.Eleven other people died, mostly after being hit by fallen trees, collapsed walls and ceilings and debris, and seven villagers were missing, Ricardo Jalad, who heads the government's disaster-response agency, told President Rodrigo Duterte in a televised meeting.A large number of houses and buildings, including an airport and a hotel, were damaged by the wind or inundated by floodwaters, officials said.In central Bohol province, which was directly hit by the typhoon, Gov. Arthur Yap said many residents remained trapped on their roofs by floodwater for a second day in the riverside town of Loboc, where his own house was swamped by water up to the second floor.Yap pleaded for volunteers from other regions to help save residents, saying he and other officials were struggling to find a way to deploy rescue boats to Loboc.“Hundreds of families are trapped on the rooftops right now,” Yap told DZBB radio, adding that residents were exposed to rain and wind overnight. “We need first responders. What's important now is to save lives.”It was unclear what happened in other towns in the hard-hit province, which still had no electricity, Yap said.Presidential spokesman Karlo Nograles said more than 332,000 people were evacuated as the typhoon approached, including nearly 15,000 who were brought to evacuation centers.Crowding in those centers complicated efforts to keep people safely distanced after authorities detected the country's first infections caused by the omicron variant of the coronavirus. Vaccination campaigns were also halted in provinces lashed by the typhoon.The coast guard grounded all vessels in dozens of ports, stranding more than 4,500 passengers and ferry and cargo ship workers.An international airport in central Cebu province was closed and several mostly domestic flights were cancelled while schools and workplaces were shut in the most vulnerable areas, Nograles said.At least 62 cities and towns either lost power entirely or were experiencing disruptions.About 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year. The archipelago is located in the seismically active Pacific “Ring of Fire” region, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-dead-as-typhoon-rai-strikes-the-philippines-101639740327738.html

Zamir Kabulov, the Kremlin's envoy to Afghanistan, said the Sunni Pashtun group has to ensure inclusiveness in power-sharing but clarified that it wasn’t an ultimatum, reported Russian news agency Sputnik."Ethnic political inclusiveness is needed. They might lose power in the near future if they keep acting like that. They will have to ensure inclusiveness. By the way, we say this without ultimatums, calmly - just do it. They will have to do it," Sputnik quoted Kabulov as saying.The Taliban announced a Cabinet expansion in September insisting that the Sunni Pashtun group has opted for an inclusive government. But a closer look showed that the government remained dominated by Taliban officials, including members of the Haqqani network. The ethnic minorities were not given any significant posts and all induction were unknown faces. They also didn’t include a single woman in the Cabinet.The international community has repeatedly called on the hardline Islamist group to share a greater fraction of the power pie with the member of ethnic minority communities such as Hazaras and Tajiks. It has not recognised the Taliban as countries around the world continue to monitor the actions of the Islamist fundamentalists on the human rights front as well as inclusiveness.Kabulov said that the Afghan assets will be unfrozen if the outfit starts making concessions, noting that the assets frozen in Western nations are the resources of the Afghan people and not the funds of the Taliban. As Afghanistan is witnessing a serious humanitarian crisis, the Russian diplomat said Western countries should bear full financial responsibility for the situation.When asked about the possibility of Russia providing a loan to the war-torn country, Kabulov said, "We can, of course, if (Russian) President (Vladimir Putin) decides. But you understand, have we got some extra money?”“Let us be careful with this. Our priority is the provision of humanitarian aid, food supplies, the provision of specific products and other essentials. Things due to what the Afghan people can survive this winter," he added, as quoted by Sputnik.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-risk-losing-power-without-inclusive-government-in-afghanistan-warns-russia-101639740378042.html

Watch here||Internet users have, once again, managed to find a “doppelganger” of none other than Tesla CEO Elon Musk. A short video first posted on TikTok of a man bearing striking resemblance to the billionaire business magnate and SpaceX chief has gone viral on social media platforms over the past few days. But some have contested that the video is, in fact, just a clever deepfake.In the video, the man, who is a self-proclaimed “Chinese Elon Musk”, is seen standing next to a car, mimicking the Tesla chief. According to a New York Post report, the video has already garnered more than 878 reactions and 1,801 shares, but sparked a debate around its authenticity in the comments.See video here:中国山寨ELON musk 还真像Most users have claimed that the video is digitally altered or a ‘deepfake’ in which Musk’s face has been superimposed on just another guy. Users have claimed that there’s a small glitch around his eyes and mouth if one looks closely.“It's a deep fake. There's a small glitch when he speaks as the camera is panning around; it's in the eyes and the mouth, looks delayed,” a user wrote in the comments.The video has, however, left many users in awe over the uncanny resemblance. Some of them even dubbed the doppelganger as “Yi Long Musk” as a joke.Similar doppelgangers and deep fakes have been spotted across the internet of many other celebrities. Earlier this year, a deep fake of Tom Cruise went viral on social media platforms. It was later debunked by TikTok users. Other celebrities including Scarlett Johansson, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and many others have discovered doppelgangers on the internet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elon-musk-doppelganger-viral-video-stuns-netizens-but-some-say-it-s-deep-fake-watch-here-101639733087324.html
17-12-2021||World||Top Pakistan Taliban commander escapes suspected drone strike||A top leader of the Pakistan Taliban escaped unhurt from a suspected drone strike on a safe house in eastern Afghanistan, the militant group said Friday.The strike on Thursday evening came a week after a ceasefire between the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the government collapsed, with militants accusing Islamabad of killing its fighters.The TTP -- a separate movement but sharing common roots with Afghanistan's new leaders -- plunged Pakistan into a period of horrific violence after forming in 2007.Two TTP sources currently in Afghanistan told AFP that Maulvi Faqir Mohammad was the target of what they described as a drone strike on a compound in Chawgam village, in the eastern province of Kunar bordering Pakistan."Maulvi Faqir Mohammad was not present at the time... two fighters of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan were wounded," one source said.The compound was being used as a base by TTP fighters from Pakistan crossing the porous border with Afghanistan, he said.Mohammad was arrested by the previous US-backed Kabul government and spent years in Afghanistan's notorious Bagram prison, but was released after the Taliban's lightning takeover of the country in August.It was not clear who was responsible for Thursday's attack, but both Pakistan and the United States have previously used unmanned aerial vehicles to conduct assassinations in the region.Bilal Karimi, a spokesman for the Afghan Taliban, told AFP from Kabul that the strike was an explosive fired from the ground.The TTP emerged 14 years ago and have been blamed for around 70,000 killings by successive Pakistani governments.Thursday marked the seventh anniversary of the TTP massacre of nearly 150 schoolchildren in Peshawar, an atrocity that remains seared on Pakistan's national consciousness.It prompted a 2014 crackdown by the military which crushed the movement and forced its hardline Islamist fighters into hiding in Afghanistan.Pakistan is now trying to quell a TTP comeback after the victory of the Taliban in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-pakistan-taliban-commander-escapes-suspected-drone-strike-101639731972077.html
17-12-2021||World||Taliban prepares Afghan budget without any foreign support||Afghanistan's finance ministry under the new Taliban government has prepared a draft national budget that, for the first time in two decades, is funded without foreign aid, a spokesman said.It comes as the country is mired in economic crisis and faces a looming humanitarian catastrophe the United Nations has called an "avalanche of hunger".Finance ministry spokesman Ahmad Wali Haqmal did not disclose the size of the draft budget -- which runs until December 2022 -- but told AFP it would go to the cabinet for approval before being published."We are trying to finance it from our domestic revenues -- and we believe we can," he earlier told state television in an interview shared on Twitter.Global donors suspended financial aid when the Taliban seized power in August and Western powers also froze access to billions of dollars in assets held abroad.The 2021 budget, put together by the previous administration under IMF guidance, projected a deficit despite 219 billion Afghanis in aid and grants and 217 billion from domestic revenue.At that time the exchange rate was around 80 Afghanis to the dollar, but the local currency has been hammered since the Taliban's return, particularly in the past week, slumping to 130 on Monday before recovering Friday to around 100.Haqmal accepted that public servants are still owed several months of wages, saying "we are trying our best" to make good on overdue pay by year-end.He warned, however, a new pay scale had also been prepared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-prepares-afghan-budget-without-any-foreign-support-101639726806871.html

17-12-2021||World||Amid new election laws, Hong Kong is all ready to cast vote||Hong Kong voters are preparing to vote for the first time this weekend since election laws were changed, amid a dearth of opposition candidates months after the city began cracking down on dissent.The legislative elections, to be held Sunday, come after Beijing in March passed a resolution for electoral reform in Hong Kong that gives Beijing more control over who is elected to Hong Kong's legislature. Beijing has tightened its grip over the semi-autonomous Chinese city following months of pro-democracy protests in 2019 that at times descended into violent clashes between police and protesters.Hong Kong later amended its laws in May, reducing the number of directly elected lawmakers to 20 from 35, even as the legislature was expanded from 70 to 90 seats. Most of the lawmakers in the legislature would be appointed by largely pro-Beijing bodies.Under the new laws, legislative candidates will also be vetted by a largely pro-Beijing committee to ensure that only “patriots” loyal to Beijing rule the city.The elections also come amid a crackdown on dissent in the city. Most of Hong Kong's prominent pro-democracy activists and opposition politicians are either in jail or awaiting trial after 47 pro-democracy figures were charged with subversion under a national security law in January over their roles in an unofficial primary election.The electoral reforms and stringent vetting processes have also led to fewer pro-democracy candidates. For the first time since 1997, no members from Hong Kong’s largest pro-democracy party, the Democratic Party, submitted applications to be nominated.Overall, the number of candidates for the elections has also fallen. This year, the elections committee approved the nominations of 153 candidates — about half of the 289 nominated to run in the 2016 race.Regina Ip, a pro-establishment candidate running in the Hong Kong Island West constituency, said that voters will take some time to get used to the new electoral system.“In the long term, this is a system that permits people of different political ideologies to take part as long as they support our basic constitutional system,” she said. “That is not too much to ask.”Voter turnout is widely expected to be low for Sunday’s elections. Polls by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute in November found that 53% of respondents opposed the new electoral system and only 52% planned to vote — which would be the lowest turnout in three decades.But Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam dismissed concerns of low voter turnout, saying that low voting numbers could indicate that people were happy with the government and did not see a need to elect different lawmakers.To encourage people to vote, authorities announced that public transport will be free on Sunday. The government also set up polling stations at border checkpoints that will allow registered Hong Kong voters living and working in mainland China to cross the border briefly to vote, before returning to the mainland without having to undergo quarantine.Earlier this month, Lam said that some 18,000 people had registered to vote at the border polling stations.Some activists abroad, such as London-based Nathan Law, have called for Hong Kong residents to boycott the elections, describing the race as a “selection” in which candidates have been vetted by “political police.”“Figures representing people have no hope of running,” Law said in a tweet earlier this week.New election laws have also banned residents in Hong Kong from inciting others to cast invalid votes or boycott the elections. Those convicted of doing so face up to three years in jail and a 200,000 Hong Kong dollar ($25,600) fine.The new electoral reforms are a “derailing of the democratization process,” said Kenneth Chan, an associate professor in Hong Kong Baptist University’s department of government and international studies.“At the end of the day, 4.4 million eligible voters in December would only be choosing 20 of the 90 lawmakers,” he said. “If you just run the arithmetic, you can easily tell there isn’t really any progress towards democracy.”The lack of candidates with different political inclinations in the elections also does not inspire confidence in terms of the possible checks and balances that could exist between the government and the legislature, according to Chan.Still, some election hopefuls are running for seats with a moderate stance. Jeffrey Chan, a so-called “non-establishment” candidate and a member of local think tank Path of Democracy, is reluctant to define his position on the political spectrum.“We would support pro-establishment lawmakers or the government if what they propose is good for Hong Kong. We will oppose if they don’t make sense,” Chan said. “We don’t have a fixed stance. This is what we are. We stand with Hong Kong citizens and we strive for democracy, rule of law and freedom.”Another candidate, Adrian Lau, is one of the few in this election who have described themselves as “pro-democracy.” Lau previously owned a public relations business, before turning to politics.He ran in the 2019 district council elections, beating veteran pro-establishment politician Michael Tien in the Tsuen Wan district. District councillors typically look after municipal matters, such as the maintenance of public facilities and organizing community events.“Now, we don’t have the power to oppose, but we could still monitor the government and officials as well as the budget,” Lau said.“A legislator also has an important role to communicate with foreign media. Do we still need someone from the pro-democracy camp to do this job? If no one is doing it, we are just sitting back and doing nothing,” he said. “I choose not to sit back and surrender.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-new-election-laws-hong-kong-is-all-ready-to-cast-vote-101639718889660.html
17-12-2021||World||Canada: Justin Trudeau government outlines Indo-Pacific strategy||In assigning responsibilities to his new Cabinet, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has asked ministers to focus on the Indo-Pacific and develop a comprehensive strategy for the region.While the 38-member Cabinet was sworn in October, the mandate letters were issued by Trudeau on Thursday and underscored the significance the region now holds in future Canadian policy-making.In his mandate letter to Minister of Foreign Affairs Melanie Joly, Trudeau said she “will lead Canada’s contribution to addressing global challenges, including by deepening our partnerships in regions of strategic importance, such as the Indo-Pacific and Arctic regions, and strengthening Canada’s diplomatic capacity”. He also added that her remit will include the responsibility to “develop and launch a comprehensive Indo-Pacific strategy to deepen diplomatic, economic and defence partnerships and international assistance in the region”. Global Affairs Canada, her department, will be supported in this objective by at least three other departments - defence, international trade and international development.Defence minister Anita Anand was asked to “support the minister of foreign affairs in developing and launching a comprehensive Indo-Pacific strategy to deepen diplomatic and defence partnerships in the region”.Meanwhile, directions for Mary Ng, Minister of International Trade, Export Promotion, Small Business and Economic Development, included “negotiating, as part of a new Indo-Pacific strategy, new bilateral and regional trade agreements, expanding foreign investment promotion and protection agreements and building stronger economic linkages”. Discussions between India and Canada over a streamlined free trade agreement have resumed this year.Finally, Minister of International Development and Minister Responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada Harjit Sajjan was told to “support the Minister of Foreign Affairs in developing and launching a comprehensive Indo-Pacific strategy to deepen diplomatic partnerships and international assistance in the region”.The Indo-Pacific has not figured so prominently in prior mandate letters during Justin Trudeau’s tenure at PM, which began in 2015, or even earlier.As the House of Commons met for the first time in November after the September elections, Canada’s governor-general (GG) Mary Simon outlined the policy priorities of the government and among those was “making deliberate efforts to deepen partnerships in the Indo-Pacific”. That was its maiden appearance in what is described as the Throne Speech, since the GG represents Canada’s head of state, Queen Elizabeth II.“Mandate letters outline the commitments that each minister will work to accomplish, as well as the pressing challenges they will address in their role. Mandate letters are not an exhaustive list of all files a minister will work on,” a release issued by the prime minister’s office noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-justin-trudeu-govt-outlines-indo-pacific-strategy-101639723612384.html
17-12-2021||World||Some US schools closed as viral TikTok challenge warns of shooting, bomb threats||Schools across the United States are on alert due to a viral post on popular video sharing app TikTok. The post warns of “shooting and bomb threats” at schools around the country on Friday (December 17).The threat is also being reported as challenge. Authorities, however, have deemed the threat to be fake.But parents are concerned, and so are students. So, school officials in states like Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois, Montana, New York and Pennsylvania have increased police presence on campus. Some of them have even announced plans to close school buildings on Friday.Important message from @laschools regarding keeping our schools safe. We look forward to seeing everyone at school tomorrow! Mensaje importante del Distrito Unificado de Los Ángeles sobre cómo mantener nuestras escuelas seguras. ¡Esperamos verlos a todos en la escuela mañana! pic.twitter.com/v2dt0X2v66The threatening post has been made on TikTok anonymously. Authorities believe it originated in Arizona; they are trying to assure the parents saying that viral posts are not considered credible.“Law enforcement agencies have investigated this threat and determined that it originated in Arizona and is not credible,” the Baltimore County Public Schools said on its Twitter account.(2/3) Law enforcement agencies have investigated this threat and determined that it originated in Arizona and is not credible. We want to continue to encourage members of Team BCPS to report suspicious or threatening activities or postings.TikTok, meanwhile, said it is cooperating with law enforcement agencies in the investigation.“We handle even rumored threats with utmost seriousness, which is why we’re working with law enforcement to look into warnings about potential violence at schools even though we have not found evidence of such threats originating or spreading via TikTok,” the social media company said in a statement.The threat comes just two weeks after the United States witnessed one of the worst school shooting incidents since 2018, in Michigan.On November 30, a 15-year-old boy opened fire inside Oxford High School in Michigan, killing four students and injuring seven others. He was later identified as Ethan Crumbley and is facing murder charges in the wake of the shooting.What’s worrying the parents and school authorities most is the disturbing trend that has gripped the children hooked to social media. In September, a “devious licks” challenge saw students across the schools in the US vandalising school bathrooms and stealing soap dispensers.Then in October, students were challenged to slap a teacher. This led to National Education Association call representatives of Facebook, Twitter and TikTok to intervene.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/viral-tiktok-challenge-warns-of-shooting-across-us-schools-on-friday-101639720530449.html

He was succeeded by present leader Kim Jong Un. In a report, Radio Free Asia confirmed the ban, quoting a resident of Sinuiju, a border city of the country. According to the resident, all leisure activities have been banned for this period. Residents can't go grocery shopping, the report said. The offenders will be arrested as it happens every year, the resident said."In the past, many people who were caught drinking or being intoxicated during the mourning period were arrested and treated as ideological criminals," the unnamed citizen said adding, "They were taken away and never seen again."The mourning period will go on for 11 days this year as this is the 10th death anniversary. Generally, a 10-day mourning period is observed every year."Even if your family member dies during the mourning period, you are not allowed to cry out loud and the body must be taken out after it's over. People cannot even celebrate their own birthdays if they fall within the mourning period," the resident added.The crackdown this year has been going on since the beginning of December as the North Korean Police were preparing for the mourning period.Kim Jong il died of a heart attack on December 17 in 2011 at the age of 69.Every year since his father's death, Kim pays respects at the memorial of his father but this year the state media did not immediately report any public activities by Kim on Friday morning, news agency AP reported. “Great leader and comrade Kim Jong Il is always with us ... and he is the eternal ‘suryong’ and sun of ‘juche (self-reliance)’ of our party and revolution,” the North’s main Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in an editorial, referring to a revered title reserved for North Korean leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-bans-laughing-shopping-to-mark-kim-jong-il-s-death-anniversary-101639718917294.html

So far twenty-three people have been taken to nearby hospitals, he said.The building houses an internal medicine clinic, an English language school and other businesses, NHK national television said.The cause of the fire and other details were not immediately known. Osaka police said they were investigating to determine whether the fire was caused by arson or an accident.People on other floors of the building were believed to have been evacuated, Kishimoto said.NHK footage showed dozens of fire engines and police vehicles on the street near the building, with onlookers watching the development from across the street.NHK quoted a witness saying she heard a woman's voice coming from the fourth floor asking for help. Another witness told TV Asahi he saw orange flames and grey smoke coming out of windows on the fourth floor of the building when he stepped outside after hearing a commotion.In all, seventy fire engines were mobilized to fight the fire, which was mostly extinguished within about 30 minutes of an emergency call, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/27-feared-dead-in-building-blaze-in-japan-s-osaka-101639714333610.html

Here's why||Gold prices climbed on Friday, poised for their best week since mid-November, as the dollar weakened after the U.S. Federal Reserve decided to withdraw its pandemic-era stimulus in response to fight to broaden inflationary risks.Spot gold was up 0.2% at $1,802.87 per ounce, as of 0323 GMT, while U.S. gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,802.60. The metal has risen 1.1% so far in the week, heading for its first weekly gain in five.The dollar index remained under pressure after hitting a one-week low in the previous session, making greenback-priced bullion cheaper for holders of other currencies. The benchmark 10-year yield dropped 3.8% so far in the week."The gold market is benefiting from high inflation, which is outweighing the Fed's hawkish stance. U.S. 10-year real yield moved deeper into negative territory, keeping the investment backdrop supportive," ANZ analysts said in a research note."Should negative interest rates stay longer than expected, it should favour investor demand for gold."Britain became the first G7 economy to hike interest rates since the onset of the pandemic on Thursday, with the U.S. central bank also signalling plans to tighten in 2022 but the European Central Bank only slightly reining in the stimulus.The Bank of Japan on Friday decided to taper its corporate debt purchases to pre-pandemic levels and scale back some of its emergency funding scheme upon reaching the March 2022 deadline.Reduced stimulus and interest rate hikes tend to push government bond yields up, raising the opportunity cost of holding bullion, which bears no interest.The U.S. Fed said it would pave the way for three quarter-percentage-point interest rate increases by the end of 2022 as the economy nears full employment and the Fed copes with a surge of inflation.Silver dipped 0.1% to $22.44 per ounce, platinum was flat at $936.01, and palladium rose 1.2% to $1,750.57.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gold-prices-surge-set-for-best-week-since-mid-november-here-s-why-101639713084309.html

It also said that Pakistan made “limited progress” in its pledge to dismantle all terrorist organizations without delay or discrimination."Pakistan made limited progress on the most difficult aspects of its 2015 National Action Plan to counter-terrorism, specifically in its pledge to dismantle all terrorist organizations without delay or discrimination," the US State Department report said in its 2020 ‘Country Reports on Terrorism’.At the same time, the US report stated that Indian security agencies are effective in disrupting terror threats and respond “in a timely manner” to the requests made by the United States for information related to terrorism investigations.On Pakistan, the US report said that in February and again in November, a Lahore anti-terrorism court convicted LeT founder Hafiz Saeed on multiple counts of terrorism financing and sentenced him to five years and six months in prison but failed to take action against other terrorist leaders.It then listed the terror attacks that took place in Pakistan last year, including the one in Quetta in which 15 people were killed and 18 others injured. Islamic Stae had claimed responsibility for the attack.The report said that on June 29, four Balochistan Liberation Army militants carrying guns and grenades charged the security barrier of the Pakistan Stock Exchange in Karachi.

Nadim Qadir, the son of a Liberation War martyr, told Hindustan Times' sister publication HT Bangla that pro-Pakistani forces, in hiding, are still attempting to lay waste to Bangladesh and that the country's security forces must exercise alert and remember that the fight against anti-national elements is not over yet.Nadim, the son of Liberation War martyr Colonel Abdul Qadir, recalled in an interview with the publication painful memories from 50 years ago when the Pakistani militia pursued the systematic elimination of nationalist Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia, religious minorities, and armed personnel.“Family members of the Mukti Bahini (the Bangladeshi resistance army) fighters are forever haunted by these traumatic recollections,” said Nadim. “I find myself getting extremely emotional every time it comes up.”He continued, “I was barely a ten-year-old kid back when my father answered the call of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and went to the frontlines. This was also the time when my mother was in a delicate state, pregnant with a child on the way. He (Nadim's father) received the news and decided to come visit my mother in the hospital pod, but he was caught by the Pakistani militia.”Gathering his thoughts, Nadim resumed, “They (the Pakistani armed forces) killed my father, less than two weeks before my younger brother Arun was born. We located Col Qadir's grave in 2007, but my mother had already passed away in 1999.”Looking back at the struggle, Nadim Qadir thanked India for lending its hand to the neighbouring country's struggle for Independence all those years ago. He said Bangladesh, with the support of its allies, is progressing under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, but there is cause for concern yet.Recalling the 2004 Dhaka grenade attack, Nadim said, “Our leader was targeted by pro-Pakistan militant outfits, many of which are still active in Bangladesh. These anti-national forces need to be eliminated. If these Pakistani collaborators continue to exist even 50 years after the war for independence, for what purpose had the Muktijoddhas laid down their lives?”Nadim Qadir, for his part, is playing his role in instilling Bengali nationalism among the new generation in his country. A foundation, named ‘Muktadhara '71’, has been established with a complex in the Mustafapur village of the Rangpur district, which serves to teach younger children the values of the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/propak-forces-still-trying-to-ruin-bangladesh-says-son-of-liberation-war-martyr-101639708210597.html

(Prince Mohammed) is no longer a king in the making, he is a king in the palace."His path to the throne is clear and has been for some time, with no foreseeable obstacles after he drove out one rival after another."There is no identifiable source of effective opposition inside or outside the royal family," said Hussein Ibish, a Washington-based Middle East expert.He added that "MBS is indeed becoming more prominent and powerful".Despite some concern that the international community would not want to deal with Prince Mohammed, especially after the Khashoggi murder, a Riyadh-based diplomat said that such fears "dissipated after Macron's visit to Saudi Arabia".While US President Joe Biden vowed a tougher approach than his predecessor Donald Trump, and has yet to directly communicate with Prince Mohammed, the administration has made it clear that it is inevitable."It's only a matter of time," said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudis-prince-mohammed-becomes-uncrowned-king-amid-father-s-failing-health-101639711377182.html

Since its detection in South Africa three weeks ago, Omicron cases have already been found in 77 countries.In the United States, which was the worst affected country by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, the number has been increasing alarmingly.The first case of Omicron was detected in the United States on December 1 after an individual travelled from South Africa to San Francisco in late November. The traveller was vaccinated.Since then, the Omicron cases have been steadily increasing in the United States.Where has Omicron been detected in the United States?According to Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the highly transmissible variant has been reported in 38 states of the country. It now makes up three per cent of the reported cases across the United States. (See map)In some states, like New York and New Jersey, there is a high presence of Omicron - in as many as 13 per cent of the total samples.In New York, the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positivity has doubled in three days, which the experts say is due to the Omicron variant. “It is clear that the Omicron variant is here in New York City in full force,” New York mayor Bill de Blasio said.However, Delta continues to be the main variant circulating in the United States.According to the CDC, 200 million Americans have been fully vaccinated, but only 56 million have received a booster shot.President Joe Biden sounds alarmAmid the unabated spread of the Omicron variant, US President Joe Biden on Thursday warned about a winter of "severe illness and death" for unvaccinated Americans."...I want to send a direct message to the American people: Due to the steps we've taken, Omicron has not yet spread as fast as it would've otherwise done and as is happening in Europe. But it's here now, and it's spreading, and it's going to increase," said Biden after meeting with members of his Covid-19 response team.Biden empathised on the need to get booster shots in guarding against the virus amid the spread of a new variant.The situation in AmericasSince the start of the pandemic, more than 98 million people in the Americas have developed Covid-19 and more than 2.3 million have died from the disease.More than a third of all cases reported worldwide, and one in four deaths, have occurred in the region.In the United States, the Covid-19 death toll surpassed the tragic number of 800,000 on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-us-38-states-have-omicron-cases-covid-positivity-rate-doubles-in-new-york-101639711469966.html

The variant has been reported in 77 countries and has been spreading faster than any other strain, according to World Health Organization (WHO).'Omicron may have higher reinfection risk but...': Watch WHO warning on OmicronThe scientists across the globe are putting their heads together to understand the behaviour of Omicron, which is considered to be highly resistant to existing vaccines. So far, the results have shown that this new strain causes less severe Covid-19 symptoms, compared to early variants of the virus.But those infected with Omicron have one symptom in common: Scratchy throat.Also Read | Why antibodies aren't the only defense against OmicronThe chief executive of South Africa-based Discovery Health recently said at a briefing that doctors have noted a slightly different set of symptoms among those testing positive.The most common early sign was a scratchy throat, said CEO Dr Ryan Noach, followed by nasal congestion, a dry cough and myalgia manifesting in lower back pain.Most of these symptoms are mild, said Dr Noach, but stressed that this does not mean that Omicron is less virulent.Also Read | Biden predicts winter of severe illness and death for unvaccinatedA leading British health expert also concurred with Dr Noach and said that preliminary data suggests Omicron is behaving “rather differently” as compared to previous strains of coronavirus.“The symptoms people get from this particular virus are different to the previous variants,” Sir John Bell told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday, adding that stuffy nose, sore throat, myalgia and loose stools are the symptoms to look out for.In India, the countrywide tally of Omicron cases reached 87 on Thursday as three states – Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat – and national capital Delhi reported fresh cases.Karnataka reported five new cases of the heavily mutated variant, while Delhi and Telangana registered four such new infections, and Gujarat saw a single case.So far, 11 states and union territories have reported Omicron infections - Maharashtra has seen 32 such cases, Rajasthan has reported 17, Delhi has 10, Karnataka has seen eight infections, Gujarat and Kerala both have reported five, Telangana six, and one case each has been reported in West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh and Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-spread-scientists-identify-1-symptom-that-confirms-presence-of-variant-101639708918826.html
17-12-2021||World||Why antibodies aren't the only defense against Omicron||In the fight against the coronavirus, one key component of the human immune system has hogged the limelight: antibodies.These Y-shaped proteins have made top news recently because Covid-19 shots don't produce as many of them that work against the heavily mutated Omicron variant compared to past strains -- at least, not without a booster.In the fight against the coronavirus, one key component of the human immune system has hogged the limelight: antibodies. But while they're rightly celebrated, they're not the only game in town.https://t.co/1FtKNBqgF8 pic.twitter.com/kcjWmgIfnTTrained by both vaccines and infection, antibodies grab on to the spike protein that studs the surface of the coronavirus, stopping it from penetrating cells and sickening the host.But while antibodies are rightly celebrated, they're not the only game in town.In fact, "there's a complex and coordinated response that is really beautiful from an evolutionary standpoint," Harvard immunologist Roger Shapiro explains.Here are some key points:'Carpet bombers' of the innate immune systemIn the minutes and hours after the virus first comes calling, signaling proteins send out alarms to recruit the tough-but-dim brutes of the "innate" immune system.First to the scene are "neutrophils," which makeup 50 to 70 percent of all white cells and are quick to fight, but also to perish.Others include hungry "macrophages" that snarf down pathogens and spit out key bits to help train their smarter colleagues, menacingly named "Natural Killer" cells, and "dendritic" cells that pass on their intel to more elite fighters."It's sort of like carpet bombing the whole area and hopefully you damage the invader as much as possible... at the same time calling into the headquarters to get your SEAL units ready to go," said John Wherry, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania.B and T cells: Intelligence officers and trained assassinsIf the invaders aren't driven off, the "adaptive" immune system comes into play.A few days into a first infection, "B cells" wise up to the threat and start pumping out antibodies.Vaccination also trains B cells -- mainly inside lymph nodes in our armpits, near the site of injection -- to be primed and ready.Shapiro likened them to intelligence operatives, holding vital information about threats.The most potent kinds of antibodies, known as "neutralizing," are like chewing gum sticking to the business end of a key, stopping it from unlocking a door.There are other, less-heralded antibodies that aren't as sticky as the neutralizing kind -- but still help grab a hold of the virus, dragging it towards immune cells, or calling for help and escalating the overall response.B cells' key partners are "T cells," which can be broadly split into "helpers" and "killers.""Killers are like assassins, and they go and attack the cells that have been infected," said Shapiro -- but these assassins also inflict collateral damage for the sake of the greater good.The helper T cells "are like generals," added Shapiro, marshaling troops, spurring B cells to up their production, and directing their lethal counterparts toward the enemy.Stopping severe diseaseBecause of its heavily mutated spike protein, the Omicron variant may more easily slip by neutralizing antibodies conferred by prior infection or vaccination.The bad news is this makes people more prone to symptomatic infection. But the good news is that T cells aren't nearly as easily fooled.T cells have a "periscope" into infected cells, where they can look for the constituent parts of the virus during its replication cycle, said Wherry.They're much better at recognizing tell-tale signs of foes they've encountered before, even if their clever disguises get them past antibodies.The killer T cells carry out search-and-destroy missions, poking holes in infected cells, bursting them open, and triggering reactions to bring inflammatory proteins known as "cytokines" to the fight.Depending on the speed of the response, a vaccinated person with a breakthrough infection might get mild, cold-like symptoms, or moderate, flu-like symptoms -- but the chances of severe disease are drastically reduced.None of this detracts from the case for boosters, which skyrocket the production of all types of antibodies, and also seem to further train B and T cells."Omicron is concerning, but the glass is still half-full -- it's not totally going to evade our responses," Wherry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-antibodies-aren-t-the-only-defense-against-omicron-101639708342408.html

This comes days after the Pakistan government gave visas to 112 pilgrims who wanted to visit the sacred complex.The visas have been given for a duration of seven days - from December 17 to 23 - during which these 112 pilgrims are expected to visit.The Katas Raj Temples complex is situated in Punjab's Chakwal district and built around a pond, which is considered sacred by Hindus.After granting the visas on Tuesday, the high commission for Pakistan in New Delhi said that it “remains committed to preserving sacred religious sites and extending all possible assistance to the visiting pilgrims of all faiths”.Earlier in December, the Pakistan high commission in India issued visas to more than 130 Indians to attend the 313th birth anniversary celebrations of Shiv Avtari Satguru Sant Shadaram Sahib in Sindh province.According to news agency PTI, visits to religious places are covered under the Pakistan-India Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines, 1974 and the Pakistani government issues visas to Indians for pilgrimage every year.Last month, the Narendra Modi-led Union government announced the reopening of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor from November 17 for the benefit of Sikh pilgrims.The Kartarpur Corridor is a visa-free border crossing that joins the Indian border to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan. The 4.7-kilometre long stretch allows devotees from India to pay a visit to the Gurudwara without a visa.In 1999, India and Pakistan proposed the idea of the Kartarpur corridor as a part of the New Delhi-Lahore bus diplomacy.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-today-indian-pilgrims-to-visit-temple-in-pakistan-s-punjab-province-101639703748780.html
17-12-2021||World||Omicron: Biden predicts 'winter of severe illness and death' for the unvaccinated||President Joe Biden warned Thursday that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus will start to spread much more rapidly in the United States and urged Americans to get vaccinated or boosted."The only real protection is to get your shot," he said, predicting "a winter of severe illness and death" for the unvaccinated.He spoke as America is growing more and more nervous over the latest chapter of the nightmare that is the coronavirus pandemic.As of December 1, the average of new daily cases of infection was 86,000. On December 14, it had shot up to 117,000 -- an increase of 35 percent.Biden stressed the importance of vaccinated people getting a booster and of those who have yet to be vaccinated receiving their first shot.Health ministers from the G7 on Thursday called for international cooperation in the face of the Omicron strain, which they called the "biggest current threat to global public health."The outbreak linked to the new variant has spread globally, and more European nations are implementing travel restrictions.The United States, the hardest-hit country in the world, is currently averaging 1,150 Covid-19 deaths per day, according to figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Americans do seem to be in for a rough winter.Broadway shows are being canceled because of more and more positive tests among drama companies.Tools 'are working'Major US universities are reverting to classes and tests online to try to halt the spread of the virus.The National Football League has introduced stricter health controls after 100 or so players tested positive since the beginning of the week. The NBA has also been hit with games being postponed.At the White House, too, there has been a change in tone.A few weeks ago, Biden told Americans the new strain of the virus was no reason to panic.On Thursday, he brought reporters in at the end of a meeting on the pandemic to, as he said in a no-nonsense voice, send a message directly to Americans: vaccinated people should get a booster and the non-vaccinated should get their shots.Shortly before, deputy White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre had suggested the administration did not intend to take specific restrictive measures for the moment and to focus instead on vaccination."The tools that we have, we know are working," she said, adding, "We're just going to continue pushing forward... to get Americans vaccinated and boosted."Biden, who was elected largely on a pledge to end the health crisis in America, unveiled on December 2 a plan to ward off a steep rise in infections, hospitalizations, and death.But he stopped short of taking more restrictive measures, knowing the issue is very sensitive.Like people elsewhere, Americans are fed up with the pandemic, and Republicans regularly speak out against the idea of forcing people to get vaccinated or wear masks.When the Omicron strain was identified weeks ago, the United States halted travel from several southern African countries but did not introduce any other restrictions, and has not tightened health measures on domestic flights.Biden's maneuvering room is limited in any case, as seen in several lawsuits that have held up his order for larger companies to force their workers to get vaccinated.The United States surpassed 800,000 Covid deaths Tuesday, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.That is higher than the population of some states, such as Alaska or North Dakota.This year, around 450,000 people have died of Covid, most of them non-vaccinated, even though effective and free vaccines became available in the spring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-biden-predicts-winter-of-severe-illness-and-death-for-the-unvaccinated-101639704260448.html
17-12-2021||World||Meta calls out spy firms for targeting 50,000 people across its platforms||Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc is calling out half a dozen private surveillance companies for hacking or other abuses, accusing them in a report published Thursday of collectively targeting about 50,000 people across its platforms.The company's fight with the spy firms comes amid a wider move by American tech companies, US lawmakers, and President Joe Biden's administration against purveyors of digital espionage services, notably the Israeli spyware company NSO Group, which was blacklisted earlier this month following weeks of revelations about how its technology was being deployed against civil society.Meta is already suing NSO in a US court. Nathaniel Gleicher, Meta's head of security policy, told Reuters that Thursday's crackdown was meant to signal that "the surveillance-for-hire industry is much broader than one company."Meta's report said it was suspending roughly 1,500, mostly fake accounts run by seven organizations across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta said the entities targeted people in more than 100 countries.Meta did not provide a detailed explanation of how it identified the surveillance firms, but it operates some of the world's biggest social and communications networks and regularly touts its ability to find and remove malicious actors from its platforms.Among them is Israel's Black Cube, which became notorious for deploying its spies on behalf of Hollywood rapist Harvey Weinstein. Meta said the intelligence firm was deploying phantom personas to chat its targets up online and gather their emails, "likely for later phishing attacks."In a statement, Black Cube said it "does not undertake any phishing or hacking" and said the firm routinely ensured "all our agents' activities are fully compliant with local laws."Others called out by Meta include BellTroX, an Indian cyber mercenary firm exposed by Reuters and the internet watchdog Citizen Lab last year, an Israeli company called Bluehawk CI, and a European firm named Cytrox - all of whom Meta accused of hacking.Cognyte, which was spun off from security giant Verint Systems Inc in February, and Israeli firms Cobwebs Technologies were accused not of hacking but of using fake profiles to trick people into revealing private data.Cognyte, Verint, and Bluehawk did not immediately return messages seeking comment.In an email, Cobwebs spokesperson Meital Levi Tal said the company drew on open sources and that its products "are not intrusive by any means." Messages left with Ivo Malinovski – who until recently identified himself as Cytrox's chief executive on LinkedIn – received no immediate response. BellTroX founder Sumit Gupta has not returned Reuters reporters' messages since his firm was exposed last year. He had previously denied wrongdoing.Gleicher refused to identify any of the targets by name but Citizen Lab, in a report published at the same time as Meta's, said that one of Cytrox's victims was Egyptian opposition figure, Ayman Nour.Nour blamed the Egyptian government for the spying, telling Reuters in an interview from Istanbul that he had long suspected he was under surveillance by officials there."For the first time I have evidence," he said.Egyptian authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Gleicher said other targets of the spy firms included celebrities, politicians, journalists, lawyers, executives, and regular citizens. Friends and family of the targets were also swept up in the espionage campaigns, he said.Meta cybersecurity official David Agranovich said he hoped Thursday's announcement would "kickstart the disruption of the surveillance-for-hire market." There were some signs that other social media firms were taking similar action, with Twitter announcing the removal of 300 accounts a few hours after Meta's announcement.Whether the takedowns deal with the companies involved more than a temporary setback remains to be seen. Two of the companies, Black Cube and BellTroX, have bounced back after being embroiled in previous spy scandals.Gleicher said that targets of the spy firms would receive automated warnings, but he said Facebook would stop short of identifying the specific firms involved or their clients. That's despite the fact that Facebook said it had identified several customers of Cobwebs, Cognyte, Cytrox, and Black Cube - the latter of which includes law firms.Marta Pardavi, one of several Hungarian human rights defenders who say they were targeted by Black Cube in 2017 and 2018, said she was gratified by the news of Facebook's report but wanted more information."They name law firms," she said. "But law firms have clients. Who are the clients for these law firms?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meta-calls-out-spy-firms-for-targeting-50-000-people-across-its-platforms-101639701416575.html
17-12-2021||World||Nicholas Burns appointed US envoy to China||The US Senate on Thursday confirmed veteran diplomat Nicholas Burns as ambassador to Beijing, filling a position vacant for more than a year despite Washington's growing focus on China.The Senate reached the key 50-vote threshold to approve Burns in an ongoing confirmation that took place after Senator Marco Rubio lifted objections. The final vote was 75-18.Burns, a former US ambassador to Greece and NATO, at his Senate hearing in October called China an "aggressor" in the region and vowed to "compete vigorously," while also seeking cooperation on areas such as climate change.President Joe Biden nominated Burns in August, more than half a year into his term. Rubio held up the nomination as he accused Burns of not being tough enough and not being clear on past dealings with China.Rubio allowed the vote, while also voting against Burns, after prolonged negotiations brought bipartisan support and passage earlier Thursday of an act to ban virtually all imports from China's northeastern region Xinjiang due to concerns of forced labor by the Uyghur minority.Democrats argued that the United States needed an ambassador in Beijing to implement the law, and Burns largely enjoyed support from a number of other Republicans after his long record in government."If you're looking for a bipartisan person to put in a position, this is your guy," said Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee."He's done an outstanding job, has an outstanding reputation amongst the cadre of ambassadors."The 65-year-old served as the State Department's number three official under former president George W. Bush and as the spokesperson of the department under Bill Clinton.Burns retired from the Foreign Service in 2008 and became a professor at Harvard University.He was an outspoken critic of Donald Trump, accusing the former president of abandoning a longstanding US consensus of standing up for US allies, encouraging democracy and welcoming legal immigration.Trump's ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, resigned in October 2020 to help the Republican president's campaign against Biden.A longtime governor of Iowa, Branstad was described as an "old friend" by President Xi Jinping who visited the agricultural state when he was a lower-ranking official.Despite Burns' confirmation, Bob Menendez, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, voiced alarm that the Senate has not acted on more than 50 diplomatic nominees due to Republican stalling.sct/to/jh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nicholas-burns-appointed-us-envoy-to-china-101639699487165.html

"They have to go somewhere, and it's probably not imprudent to build them here in Western Europe, centralized under our laws, and to see what they can mean in this case for Zeewolde."Meta spokeswoman Melanie Roe said initial construction costs would be around 700 million euros ($795 million) and no date has been set yet for completion.The 800,000-strong population of Amsterdam are heavy users of data services provided by Meta, yet regional authorities have issued a ban on the construction of further data centres in the city due to strains on its electric grid.The Dutch Data Centre Association estimates that currently data centres make up about 3% of all Dutch electricity usage, but that may rise to 10% by 2030.($1 = 0.8812 euros)(Reporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle and David Gregorio)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meta-to-build-its-largest-data-centre-in-netherlands-zeewolde-101639697783472.html
17-12-2021||World||‘They can go take a walk’: IMF closes its Brazil office after govt criticism||The International Monetary Fund said Thursday it will close its Brazilian office, a day after receiving harsh criticism from Economy Minister Paulo Guedes over its forecasts for Latin America's biggest economy.The IMF said it would close its office in Brasilia when the current country representative's mandate expires on June 30, 2022.The move came after Guedes, far-right President Jair Bolsonaro's ultra-liberal economy guru, said the IMF was overly pessimistic in its forecasts on Brazil and was no longer welcome."They can go take a walk," he said Wednesday."They were here forecasting (Brazil's economy) would contract by 9.7 percent (in 2020) and Britain's would contract by four percent. In the end, we contracted by four percent, and Britain by 9.7 percent," he said.He also accused IMF officials in the country of being more interested in "football and feijoada" -- a meat-and-bean stew that is one of Brazil's most famous attractions -- than in helping the economy.The IMF opened its office in Brazil in 1999, when the country turned to the Washington institution for financing to help get out of an economic crisis.That program ended in 2005.The IMF said it had maintained the office to "facilitate dialogue," but Guedes said that was no longer needed."They've been here long enough. There was a lot of imbalance in the relationship," he said.Guedes and Bolsonaro have been at pains to shore up confidence in Brazil's recession-hit economy as the president heads toward elections next October with his popularity at an all-time low.Bolsonaro has alarmed investors by maneuvering to break Brazil's constitutional spending cap in order to fund big social spending, a move condemned as economic populism by critics.Guedes insists the pessimism is unwarranted and that the Bolsonaro administration will leave a stronger economy than it inherited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/they-can-go-take-a-walk-imf-closes-its-brazil-office-after-guedes-criticism-101639696841149.html
17-12-2021||World||US CDC committee recommends Moderna, Pfizer Covid jabs over J&J's||A panel of outside advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday voted to recommend Americans choose to receive one of the other two authorized COVID-19 vaccines over Johnson & Johnson's shot, due to rare but sometimes fatal cases of blood clotting.The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization voted unanimously to make the recommendation in favor of the vaccines made by Moderna Inc and Pfizer/BioNTech over the J&J shot. The regulator still needs to sign off on the guidance.Fewer Americans have received the J&J shot than the other two vaccines by a significant margin. Out of more than 200 million fully vaccinated people in the United States, around 16 million received J&J's vaccine, according to CDC data.J&J said in a statement that the safety and well-being of those who use their vaccine is its top priority and it looks forward to working with the CDC on the next steps.Cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), which involves blood clots accompanied by a low level of platelets, have previously been reported in recipients of the J&J vaccine. The highest reporting rates are in women under 50.The CDC said that the rate of such incidents is higher than previously estimated, both in women and men. The agency has identified more than 50 cases of TTS in the US, about 3.83 cases per million J&J doses administered.At least nine people have died following the blood clotting incidents in the United States, the CDC has said.Members of the panel also said J&J's vaccine is less effective in preventing COVID-19 than the other two authorized vaccines.In a presentation to the committee, a leading J&J vaccine scientist said the vaccine generates a strong and long-lasting immune response with just a single shot."In the setting where many people do not return for a second dose or a booster, the durability of the single shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine as a primary regimen could make a crucial difference in saving lives in the U.S. and around the globe," J&J's Dr. Penny Heaton said.J&J's vaccine uses a technology based on a modified version of an adenovirus to spur immunity in recipients, while the other two authorized vaccines use messenger RNA technology.In the United States, the shot has been useful for reaching some hard-to-reach populations and settings like the homeless and residents of corrections facilities. The vaccine can also be stored and moved at higher temperatures than the mRNA vaccines, which could allow it to be used more easily in some low- and middle-income countries.J&J's one-dose vaccine received emergency use authorization in March. In April, U.S. regulators paused administering the vaccine for 10 days in order to investigate the blood clotting.A CDC scientist said on Thursday that the rate of deaths from TTS did not decrease after the pause in April.J&J shares closed up around 1 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. The company sells the vaccine at a not-for-profit price, so it has not been a significant revenue driver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-committee-recommends-moderna-pfizer-covid-jabs-over-jjs-101639696539160.html
17-12-2021||World||US sanctions China, imposes new trade curbs over Uyghur rights||The United States on Thursday unleashed a volley of actions to censure China's treatment of the Uyghur minority, with lawmakers voting to curb trade and new sanctions slapped on the world's top consumer drone maker.The United States has been ramping up pressure on China amid a crop of disputes, with President Joe Biden's administration a day earlier targeting producers of painkillers that have contributed to America's addiction crisis.The US Senate unanimously voted to make the United States the first country to ban virtually all imports from China's northwestern Xinjiang region over concerns of the prevalence of forced labor."We know it's happening at an alarming, horrific rate with the genocide that we now witness being carried out," said Senator Marco Rubio, a driver behind the act, which already passed the House of Representatives and which the White House says Biden will sign.After prolonged negotiations to secure its passage, Rubio lifted objections and the Senate confirmed veteran diplomat Nicholas Burns as ambassador to China.Burns, a widely respected former ambassador to Greece and NATO and a professor at Harvard, has described China as an "aggressor" and denounced the "genocide" of the Uyghurs, but has also voiced a willingness to cooperate on issues such as climate change.Some US businesses had voiced unease about the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which bans the import of all goods from the region unless companies offer verifiable proof that production did not involve slavery.Xinjiang is a major source of cotton, with an estimated 20 percent of the garments imported each year into the United States including some material from the region.Rights experts, witnesses and the US government say more than one million Uyghurs and other Turkic-speaking Muslims are incarcerated in camps in an effort to root out their Islamic cultural traditions and forcibly homogenize them into China's Han majority.Beijing describes the sites as vocational training centers and says that, like many Western nations, it is seeking to reduce the allure of radical Islam following deadly attacks.The United States has described the campaign as genocide and, along with Australia, Britain and Canada, has planned a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Games next year over the issue.High-tech surveillanceThe Biden administration on Thursday also fired off a round of new sanctions over surveillance in Xinjiang, where rights groups say China has been honing new technologies in artificial intelligence and DNA tracking to keep tabs on Uyghurs.Companies hit by Treasury Department sanctions include SZ DJA Technology, by far the world's largest producer of consumer drones of the type used in filmmaking and aerial photography."These eight entities actively support the surveillance and tracking of members of ethnic and religious minority groups in the PRC, predominantly Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang," Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, referring to the People's Republic of China.The United States had already restricted trade exports to the company, but the new Treasury Department sanctions will criminalize any US investment in it.Other companies targeted included Xiamen Meiya Pico Information, which has developed a mobile application to track files on individuals' phones, and Cloudwalk Technology, which was developed to recognize faces of Uyghurs and Tibetans and has since been deployed to Zimbabwe to help improve the technology, according to the Treasury Department.Separately, the Commerce Department restricted sensitive exports to the Academy of Military Medical Sciences and 11 of its research institutes over biotechnology work including "purported brain-control weaponry," a notice said.The research institutes include centers focused on blood transfusions, bio-engineering and toxicology."The scientific pursuit of biotechnology and medical innovation can save lives," Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement."Unfortunately, the PRC is choosing to use these technologies to pursue control over its people and its repression of members of ethnic and religious minority groups," she added.Based in Beijing, the Academy of Military Medical Sciences has been active in development of a Covid-19 vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sanctions-china-imposes-new-trade-curbs-over-uyghur-rights-101639696287363.html
