However, the aircraft landed safely at San Jose.The incident has been described as ‘one-in-a-million’ that landed with all onboard safe but left the passengers stranded over Christmas as they could not make it back to London on the same flight.Two such passengers, Jo Mitchell and Geir Olafsson, were on honeymoon in Costa Rica. They had set off from their Pacific coast resort to return to Edinburgh via Gatwick to meet family for Christmas.“My husband is part-Icelandic and his family who live in Edinburgh celebrate Christmas on 24 December. We were desperately trying to find a connecting flight at this point that would get us there in time to not miss his family Christmas,” Mitchell told British newspaper The Independent.According to them, the BA app was saying showing a vague status about the flight being delayed to the next day. "The flight time, however, only showed a four-hour delay. We had received no information via email or message so we hoped it was just a glitch. We dropped our car and continued to the airport, desperately hoping it wasn’t true,” Mitchell said.The flight was rescheduled 50 hours after the original departure time.“At this point we were devastated – realising we would miss Christmas with both of our families,” Mitchell noted.British Airways later issued an apology to the passengers who had to cancel their Christmas Day plans because of the incident.“We will never fly an aircraft unless we feel it is completely safe to do so, and on this occasion, our engineers were unable to clear it to fly. Since then, our teams have been working behind the scenes to do all they can to ensure an aircraft is ready at the earliest opportunity to bring customers to London,” British Airways officials said as quoted by The Independent.“We appreciate the patience and the understanding of our customers and our engineers and crew colleagues who have also done all they can to assist,” the official was quoted as saying.British Airways offered a full refund to all the affected passengers, and an additional 520 pounds per person stipulated for long delays under air passengers’ rights rules, the report said.(With Agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-airways-flight-suffers-freak-accident-windscreen-smashes-at-35-000-feet-101640711002418.html

We will continue to vigorously defend ourselves," Castañeda said.Pichai in 2019 was warned that describing the company's Incognito browsing mode as "private" was problematic, yet it stayed the course because he did not want the feature "under the spotlight," according to a court filing in September.In her order on Monday, US Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen in San Jose, California, said "a few documents establish that specific relevant information was communicated to, and possibly from, Pichai," and therefore supported a request from the plaintiffs' lawyers to question him.Google has earlier said it makes clear that Incognito only stops data from being saved to a user's device and is fighting the lawsuit.The Alphabet unit's privacy disclosures have generated regulatory and legal scrutiny in recent years amid growing public concerns about online surveillance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alphabet-ceo-pichai-can-be-questioned-in-privacy-lawsuit-judge-rules-101640711683518.html

The two encounters took place on July 1 and October 21, according to a document China submitted to the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs in early December, Chinese official media reported.Zhao said that China’s under-construction space station, which had three astronauts on board during that period, was “…forced to take evasive actions to avoid collision with the satellites”.Zhao said that the US keeps claiming the so-called concept of responsible conduct in outer space, but it ignores international treaty obligations on outer space and poses a serious threat to the lives of astronauts. “This is a typical double standard,” he said, adding that China urges the US to act responsibly.Citing “The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, Zhao said astronauts shall be regarded as the envoys of mankind, and all counties should respect and protect their safety and report any life-threatening situation for astronauts to the secretary-general of the UN and other contracting nations.The Chinese government gave details of the two “encounters” in the document submitted to the UN.The China Manned Space Programme completed five launch missions in 2021, with the successful launching into orbit of the Tianhe core module of the China Space Station, the Tianzhou-II and Tianzhou-III cargo spacecraft and the Shenzhou-XII and Shenzhou-XIII crewed spacecraft, the document said.During this period, Starlink satellites launched by Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) of the United States of America have had two close encounters with the China Space Station. For safety reasons, the China Space Station implemented preventive collision avoidance control on July 1and October 21, 2021, respectively,” the document said.Following the news of the near-collisions, Musk and his space programme faced a backlash on Chinese social media with netizens calling the satellites a new US weapon in space.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-its-space-station-had-close-encounters-with-elon-musk-s-satellites-101640689439397.html

Footage showed masked residents queueing to be tested in streets and sports centres.'There's no food'But banned from driving and limited to sending out one household member every three days to buy groceries, many Xi'an residents have taken to social media to call for help in acquiring food and other essentials."I'm about to be starved to death," wrote one person on the Weibo site."There's no food, my housing compound won't let me out, and I'm about to run out of instant noodles ... please help!""I don't want to hear any more news about how everything is fine," said another."So what if supplies are so abundant -- they're useless if you don't actually give them to people."Authorities have insisted that supplies remain stable as they maintain strict controls on movement into and out of Xi'an.Students have also been banned from leaving university dormitories unless necessary, CCTV reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-expands-lockdowns-amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases-101640675645402.html

Many healthcare experts have advocated getting the third shot in the wake of these emerging and more dangerous strains of the virus. But there are some voices opposing this.Dr Craig Spencer, an emergency room doctor in New York, shared his observations on Twitter about what he has seen during Covid-19. He has also talked about vaccines and if there is a need for a booster shot.“Every patient I’ve seen with Covid that’s had a 3rd ‘booster’ dose has had mild symptoms. By mild I mean mostly sore throat. Lots of sore throat. Also some fatigue, maybe some muscle pain. No difficulty breathing. No shortness of breath. All a little uncomfortable, but fine,” Dr Spencer said.Every patient I’ve seen with Covid that’s had a 3rd ‘booster’ dose has had mild symptoms.By mild I mean mostly sore throat. Lots of sore throat.

More fatigued. More fever. More coughing. A little more miserable overall. But no shortness of breath. No difficulty breathing. Mostly fine.”But those with one dose of Johnson & Johnson were “worse overall”, said Dr Spencer, adding that they had fever for a few days. Tiredness, weakness, shortness of breath and cough were also common Covid-19 symptoms for this group, according to his Twitter thread.The doctor also said that every patient that needed to be admitted for Covid has been unvaccinated. They had “profound shortness of breath” and their “oxygen levels dropped when they walked”. “Every one needing oxygen to breath regularly,” he added.Dr Spencer then appealed to the people to get their vaccine shots, saying the greatest burden falls on the unvaccinated.Those who got a single J&J similarly may have more symptoms, but have more protection than the unvaccinated (if you got a single dose of J&J, please get another vaccine dose—preferably Pfizer or Moderna—ASAP!)But as I’ve witnessed in the ER, the greatest burden still falls on…He continued: “Most patients I’ve seen that had 2 doses of Pfizer/Moderna still had ‘mild’ symptoms, but more than those who had received a third dose.

28-12-2021||World||World hits record daily Covid-19 cases as Omicron mars Christmas||Global Covid-19 cases hit a daily record on Monday, disrupting the holiday season a year after vaccines first started rolling out and two years after the emergence of the virus that many hoped would be fleeting. The more than 1.44 million worldwide infections smashed the prior record after factoring out a day in December 2020 when Turkey backdated a significant number of cases. A more conservative gauge -- the seven-day rolling average that smooths out one-time fluctuations and holiday reporting irregularities -- is also at a record level, thanks to a tidal wave of Omicron infections.The highly-mutated and most transmissible variant yet, Omicron is fast becoming the dominant strain globally as it evades immunity normally provided by vaccines and previous infections. The seven-day rolling average of cases on Monday stood at about 841,000, a jump of 49% from a month ago when micron was first identified in southern Africa. Studies suggest that although Omicron infects 70 times faster than previous strains, the illness it causes may not be as severe, especially for people who have been vaccinated and received a booster shot. The ease of transmission and soaring number of cases could still squeeze hospital capacity worldwide, leaving the unvaccinated and anyone who needs medical care for other conditions in the lurch. Governments already are warning that infections and hospitalization may soar following the holidays, setting a grim tone as the world heads into the third year of the pandemic.The silver lining is that daily Covid deaths haven’t significantly increased. The seven-day rolling average of deaths has hovered at about 7,000 since mid-October after falling from a delta-driven peak, despite the emergence of Omicron. The outlook heading into 2022 depends on whether the death toll follows cases and surges higher in the days to come, or if the Omicron wave proves mild as more real-world data emerges. While deaths tend to lag infection rates by a few weeks, early indications from southern Africa and other locations where Omicron has been circulating suggest some decoupling of the measures.Better pandemic tools may explain some of the rise in case counts. More infections are being found during this Omicron wave thanks to improved contact tracing and testing capabilities in the worldwide fight against the pathogen.The record case counts are increasing pressure on public health officials to reassess their Covid control policies. The U.S. cut the recommended isolation time for people who test positive for Covid-19, allowing them to return to work sooner and potentially helping reduce widespread disruptions that could close schools or snarl supply chains. The arrival of Omicron broadly halted the march toward normalization that characterized much of 2021. A reluctance to return to pre-vaccine lockdowns and other Covid curbs may be allowing the virus to spread more widely, though it’s also giving some people a more traditional holiday season with family and friends after a dismal 2020 before vaccines were widely available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-hits-record-daily-covid-19-cases-as-omicron-mars-christmas-101640671360250.html

When Anvisa approved shots for 5 to 11-year-olds, Bolsonaro provoked controversy by saying he wanted to make public the names of the officials who had signed off on the approval.On Dec. 23, Queiroga, the health minister, provoked further controversy by saying that the number of Covid-19 deaths among children did not justify an emergency authorization. He later said that coronavirus vaccines for children would require a doctor's prescription, which state health secretaries immediately contradicted."I've talked with Queiroga about this. On the 5th, he should published a note about how vaccinating children should be carried out," Bolsonaro said. "I hope there's no judicial interference. I hope. Because my daughter isn't getting vaccinated, let me make that very clear."A government coronavirus advisory body released a note saying that 301 children between the ages of 5 and 11 have died of Covid-19 in Brazil.Bolsonaro himself has refused to get vaccinated and has repeatedly called into question the safety and efficacy of coronavirus vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-not-vaccinate-daughter-against-covid-19-brazilian-president-bolsonaro-101640660203730.html

Most of those took place in the Baltic region around Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, where the organization has an air-policing operation.“Generally, intercepts occurred without incident as NATO planes take off to identify the approaching aircraft and escort it out of the area. Very few intercepted flights entered allied airspace,” a statement from the 30-country US-led alliance said.NATO intercept flights are a routine occurrence. But despite high tensions between NATO and Moscow over the activities of Russian armed forces near Ukraine’s borders in recent months, the number of Russia-linked intercepts decreased this year.In 2020, NATO jets scrambled around 350 times in response to Russian planes.More than 60 NATO jets are on round-the-clock alert across Europe to respond to things like unannounced military flights or civilian planes losing communication with air-traffic controllers for any reason, which could range from technical problems to hijacking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-says-its-jets-scrambled-290-times-due-to-russian-planes-101640659705747.html

28-12-2021||World||US officials recommend shorter 5-day quarantine for Covid patients||US health officials on Monday cut isolation restrictions for Americans who catch the coronavirus from 10 to five days, and similarly shortened the time that close contacts need to quarantine.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said the guidance is in keeping with growing evidence that people with the coronavirus are most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop.The decision also was driven by a recent surge in Covid-19 cases, propelled by the omicron variant.Early research suggests omicron may cause milder illnesses than earlier versions of the coronavirus. But the sheer number of people becoming infected — and therefore having to isolate or quarantine — threatens to crush the ability of hospitals, airlines and other businesses to stay open, experts say.CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the country is about to see a lot of omicron cases."Not all of those cases are going to be severe. In fact many are going to be asymptomatic,” she told The Associated Press on Monday. “We want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning while following the science."Last week, the agency loosened rules that previously called on health care workers to stay out of work for 10 days if they test positive. The new recommendations said workers could go back to work after seven days if they test negative and don’t have symptoms. And the agency said isolation time could be cut to five days, or even fewer, if there are severe staffing shortages.Now, the CDC is changing the isolation and quarantine guidance for the general public to be even less stringent.The change is aimed at people who are not experiencing symptoms. People with symptoms during isolation, or who develop symptoms during quarantine, are encouraged to stay home.The CDC’s isolation and quarantine guidance has confused the public, and the new recommendations are “happening at a time when more people are testing positive for the first time and looking for guidance,” said Lindsay Wiley, an American University public health law expert.Nevertheless, the guidance continues to be complex.IsolationThe isolation rules are for people who are infected. They are the same for people who are unvaccinated, partly vaccinated, fully vaccinated or boosted.They say:—The clock starts the day you test positive.—An infected person should go into isolation for five days, instead of the previously recommended 10.—At the end of five days, if you have no symptoms, you can return to normal activities but must wear a mask everywhere — even at home around others — for at least five more days.—If you still have symptoms after isolating for five days, stay home until you feel better and then start your five days of wearing a mask at all times.QuarantineThe quarantine rules are for people who were in close contact with an infected person but not infected themselves.For quarantine, the clock starts the day someone is alerted they may have been exposed to the virus.Previously, the CDC said people who were not fully vaccinated and who came in close contact with an infected person should stay home for at least 10 days.Now the agency is saying only people who got booster shots can skip quarantine if they wear masks in all settings for at least 10 days.That’s a change. Previously, people who were fully vaccinated — which the CDC has defined as having two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — could be exempt from quarantine.Now, people who got their initial shots but not boosters are in the same situation as those who are partly vaccinated or are not vaccinated at all: They can stop quarantine after five days if they wear masks in all settings for five days afterward.Five daysSuspending both isolation and quarantine after five days is not without risk.A lot of people get tested when they first feel symptoms, but many Americans get tested for others reasons, like to see if they can visit family or for work. That means a positive test result may not reveal exactly when a person was infected or give a clear picture of when they are most contagious, experts say.When people get infected, the risk of spread drops substantially after five days, but it does not disappear for everyone, said Dr. Aaron Glatt, a New York physician who is a spokesman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.“If you decrease it to five days, you're still going to have a small but significant number of people who are contagious,” he said.That's why wearing masks is a critical part of the CDC guidance, Walensky said.Varying recommendationsThe new CDC guidance is not a mandate; it’s a recommendation to employers and state and local officials. Last week, New York state said it would expand on the CDC’s guidance for health care workers to include employees who have other critical jobs that are facing a severe staffing shortage.It’s possible other states will seek to shorten their isolation and quarantine policies, and CDC is trying to get out ahead of the shift. “It would be helpful to have uniform CDC guidance” that others could draw from, rather than a mishmash of policies, Walensky said.Given the timing with surging case counts, the update “is going to be perceived as coming in response to pressure from business interests,” Wiley said. But some experts have been calling for the change for months, because shorter isolation and quarantine periods appeared to be sufficient to slow the spread, she said.The move by CDC follows a decision last week by U.K. officials to reduce the self-isolation period for vaccinated people who test positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-officials-recommend-shorter-5-day-quarantine-for-covid-patients-101640648972769.html

The holidays in Russia will last till January 9.Earlier this month, Moscow submitted draft security documents demanding that Nato deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back the alliance’s military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe. Washington and its allies have refused to provide such pledges, but said they are ready for the talks.The demands, contained in a proposed Russia-US security treaty and a security agreement between Moscow and Nato, were drafted amid soaring tensions over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that has stoked fears of a possible invasion.Russia has denied it has plans to attack its neighbour but pressed for legal guarantees that would rule out Nato expansion and weapons deployment there.Lavrov said last week that, in addition to talks with the US, Moscow will start talks with Nato, as well as separate negotiations under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg has decided to convene a meeting of the Nato-Russia Council on January 12, a Nato official said on Saturday, adding that the bloc was in touch with Russia about the meeting.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday confirmed the meeting will take place, calling talks with Nato “important”.Turkey urged Russia on Monday to drop “one-sided” demands and adopt a more constructive approach. The Nato member has irritated Moscow by supplying combat drones to Ukraine that Russia fears could be used by Kiev in its conflict with separatists in two regions.Situation at Afghan-Tajik border a concern: RussiaThe security situation at the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border is a concern, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, a risk Moscow has sought to mitigate by strengthening its military base in Tajikistan with weapons and other equipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/talks-with-us-to-start-after-holidays-russia-101640647103668.html
28-12-2021||World||Israel starts testing for 4th Covid vaccine jab||An Israeli hospital administered fourth Covid-19 vaccine doses on Monday to a test group, as the country considers approving the measure for vulnerable populations in a bid to outpace a surge in infections fuelled by the Omicron variant.The Sheba Medical Centre study in Ramat Gan outside Tel Aviv “will zero in on efficacy of the vaccine in producing antibodies, and safety, in order to ascertain if a fourth vaccine is needed in general”, a spokesman said. The 150 subjects are all medical staff.A health ministry expert panel last week recommended that Israel become the first country to offer a fourth vaccine dose - also known as a second booster - to those aged over 60, those suffering from compromised immune systems, and medical workers.But the fourth shot awaits final approval by the ministry’s director-general, Nachman Ash.AZ vaccine behind lower deaths in UK: ExpertBritain’s early deployment of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to protect against Covid-19 may be responsible for the country’s lower death rates compared to other European countries, a UK vaccines expert has said.Dr Clive Dix, former chairman of the UK’s Vaccine Task Force, told the Daily Telegraph that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - manufactured and administered in India as Covidshield - may offer stronger long-term protection against severe Covid-19 and death.China: Xian imposes ‘strictest’ controls to halt Covid outbreakThe locked-down Chinese city of Xi’an on Monday tightened Covid-19 controls to the “strictest” level, banning residents from driving cars around town in an effort to control the country’s worst outbreak in 21 months.Authorities have not announced any infections with the Omicron variant among the 635 confirmed cases in Xian from December 9 to Sunday.Oz reports at least 10k daily cases for first timeAustralia reported more than 10,000 daily Covid-19 cases for the first time since the start of the pandemic amid the rapid spread of the Omicron strain.New South Wales on Monday recorded 6,324 cases, with 55 in intensive care among 520 people in hospital. The most populous state also reported its first known death from the Omicron variant - a man in his 80s with underlying health issues who had received two doses of vaccine and became infected in his nursing home.Britain’s government will not introduce new Covid-19 restrictions for England before the end of 2021, its health minister Sajid Javid said on Monday.‘It’s going to get worse before it gets better’The top US infectious-disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, warned on Monday that with the rise of the highly contagious Omicron, “it’s going to get worse before it gets better”.“We don’t expect things are going to turn around in a few days to a week. It likely will take much longer than that, but that’s unpredictable,” he said on ABC.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday it was investigating nearly 70 cruise ships after reports of Covid-19 cases on board, as the Omicron variant upended holiday travel over the Christmas weekend.President Joe Biden on Monday said some US hospitals could be “overrun” by Covid cases, but the country is generally well prepared to meet the latest surge and Americans need not panic.Travel affected during Christmas weekendAbout 8,300 flights were grounded and tens of thousands more delayed on the weekend - one of the year’s busiest travel periods - with multiple airlines saying that Omicron spikes caused staffing shortages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-starts-testing-for-4th-covid-vaccine-jab-101640646408951.html
