Despite the free and widespread availability of vaccines, only 59.4% of Americans are fully vaccinated, which leaves them open to contracting and spreading the virus.President Joe Biden is scheduled to announce the measures later on Thursday.On Wednesday, the day the US reported its first case of the Omicron variant, he said the “new variant is a cause for concern but not a cause for panic” and said, citing his medical advisers, vaccination, along with the booster dose, remained the best protection against it.In a fact-sheet released on Thursday morning, the White House said the array of measures to be announced, the president will urge more than 100 million eligible Americans to get their booster shots and announce steps to expand availability through federal partner pharmacies because an ongoing surge in demand.The American president will also urge businesses to give employees paid time-off for their booster shots and call on them to take steps to protect employees at work.Biden will announce new measures to keep schools open that would include reviewing and implementing “layered prevention strategies”. More than 99% of US schools are open and are conducting classes in-person and their prolonged closure earlier had triggered widespread outrage, with political overtones in many states, especially those with Republican administrations.The administration also plans to expand the availability of free at-home testing kits. The White House said, “We are on track to quadruple the supply of rapid at-home tests that we had in late-Summer. Today’s actions will help Americans access the tests they need to help them stop the spread of Covid-19 to others.”On in-bound international travelers, the administration plans stronger health protocols in addition to restrictions announced earlier for visitors from some African countries with Omicron outbreaks. Travellers from other countries will be required to produce a negative test result done in 24 hours, “regardless of nationality or vaccination status”.Mask will be mandatory on international flights - and other public transport - till March 18. Fines will continue to be doubled from their initial levels for noncompliance with the masking requirements - with a minimum fine of $500 and fines of up to $3,000 for repeat offenders, the White House said in the fact-sheet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-joe-biden-to-announce-new-measures-to-tackle-covid19-101638466781899.html
02-12-2021||World||IMF warns of 'economic collapse' unless G20 extends debt relief||The IMF on Thursday urged advanced economies in the G20 to extend and improve their debt relief initiative, warning that many countries face a dire crisis without the help."We may see economic collapse in some countries unless G20 creditors agree to accelerate debt restructurings and suspend debt service while the restructurings are being negotiated," IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said in a blog, adding that it is critical private creditors also offer relief.The G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) expires at the end of the year, and without a renewal, countries would face financial pressure and spending cuts just as new Covid-19 variants are spreading and interest rates are expected to rise, she said."Debt challenges are pressing and the need for action is urgent. The recent Omicron variant is a stark reminder that the pandemic will be with us for a while," Georgieva said in the blog co-authored by Ceyla Pazarbasioglu, director of the fund's Strategy, Policy, and Review Department.Georgieva did not specify which economies faced a crisis, but referred simply to "low-income countries."Advanced economies in the Group of 20 announced the program last year amid the Covid-19 pandemic, which hit poor countries the hardest, hampering the ability of those governments to service their debt and support their people.The G20 twice extended the DSSI, but the IMF and World Bank have been urging creditors to do more to help with the burgeoning debt load. There are 73 countries eligible for relief under the program.Debt distress The World Bank estimates that debt loads in poor countries surged 12 percent to a record $860 billion in 2020 amid the pandemic, and Georgieva said "about 60 percent of low-income countries are at high risk or already in debt distress."Given the problems with the debt relief program and the common framework for dealing with private creditors, only three countries so far have applied for relief -- Chad, Ethiopia and Zambia -- and they have faced "significant delays."The framework has "yet to deliver on its promise. This requires prompt action," she said.She noted that Chad's program is hung up due to the need to restructure a large amount owed to a private company.And with inflation surging in major economies, central banks are pulling back on stimulus and expected to begin raising interest rates next year, which would increase debt service costs for poor nations and likely would see capital flee those countries."No doubt 2022 will be much more challenging with the tightening of international financial conditions on the horizon," Georgieva said.The IMF is calling for improvements in the program, especially mechanisms to oblige private creditors to participate, which would encourage more poor countries to make use of the DSSI.In addition, "a comprehensive and sustained debt service payment standstill for the duration of the negotiation would provide relief to the debtor at a time when it is under stress," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-warns-of-economic-collapse-unless-g20-extends-debt-relief-101638462397696.html

France has already reported its first case of the new variant, being said to be more dangerous than the Delta strain.“We should see a progressive rise of the Omicron variant, which will take over from Delta, possibly by the end of January,” French government adviser Jean-Francois Delfraissy told BFM television, according to news agency Reuters.The "true enemy" for now was still the Delta variant, spreading in a "fifth wave", he was further quoted as saying.Also read | Omicron variant detected in India, two positive cases in Karnataka"Christmas is not at risk if the population and decision-makers are all very cautious," he said, emphasising that physical distancing and a booster shot of vaccines were key.French authorities on Thursday confirmed the first case of the Covid-19 Omicron variant on the mainland, a man in his 50s who recently returned from Nigeria.Omicron was first detected in South Africa in November and has spread to at least two dozen countries since. While much remains unknown about the new variant, South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) said early epidemiological data suggested Omicron was able to evade some immunity, but existing vaccines should still protect against severe disease and death.Also read | Will Omicron be as deadly as Delta? Virologist on symptoms, prevention and scare around the new strainWorld Health Organisation (WHO) epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove told a briefing that data should be available "within days" on Omicron's contagiousness.Meanwhile, France is facing a fifth wave of Covid-19 since the pandemic emerged last year, and three hospitals in northeast France have implemented emergency protocols because beds are filling rapidly with Covid patients. Health minister Olivier Veran has warned that average daily cases are likely to surpass the peaks of the third wave that hit last spring, possibly as soon as this week.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-could-soon-become-dominant-variant-of-covid-19-in-france-adviser-101638446436545.html
02-12-2021||World||Peng Shuai: China opposes ‘politicisation’ of sports||China said on Thursday that politics should be kept out of sports after the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) suspended tournaments in the country over concerns for Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai’s safety.The WTA, the global governing body for women’s professional tennis, on Wednesday announced the “immediate suspension of all tournaments in China”, including in Hong Kong, citing concerns about the well-being of Peng, a former doubles world number one, who accused a top former Communist Party of China (CPC) leader Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault a month ago.The WTA also cited concerns over the safety of other players as a reason for suspending tournaments.The Chinese foreign ministry did not directly respond to the WTA’s decision to suspend competitions, but said it was against politicisation of sport.When asked about the matter at a regular briefing, foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin gave a one line response, saying China “opposes the politicisation of sports”.China has remained largely silent over the huge scandal, blocking discussions of the topic on China’s heavily-censored internet.On November 23, the foreign ministry had said it hoped that “malicious hype” about tennis star Peng’s whereabouts and well-being would stop, and that her case would not be politicised.Instead, the Chinese government has allowed state-controlled media to go on the offensive, describing the global concern for Peng’s well-being as politicising sport.On Thursday, the editor of the tabloid, Global Times, accused the WTA of “coercing” Peng to “support the West’s attack” on China by suspending tournaments in the country until was assured of her well-being.The tabloid also cited a statement from the Chinese Tennis Association saying that it would defend its rights, and warning that the WTA should bear the legal consequences.In an editorial aimed at the WTA’s decision, the tabloid accused it of “bringing politics into women’s tennis” and of being a “lever of Western public opinion”.“WTA suspended tournaments in China amid so-called concerns about the safety of Peng Shuai. The WTA is expanding its influence in a speculative way, bringing politics into women’s tennis deeply, setting a bad example for the entire sporting world,” the editorial posted on Twitter – which is banned in China – said on Thursday.Meanwhile, the International Olympic Committee said in a statement on Thursday that it had held a second video call with Peng, having held the first late last month.“We share the same concern as many other people and organisations about the wellbeing and safety of Peng Shuai. This is why, just yesterday, an IOC team held another video call with her,” the IOC said.The whereabouts of Peng, a former doubles world number one and one of China’s top tennis icons, have been a matter of international concern since November 2 when she posted a message on social media alleging that China’s former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli had sexually assaulted her.Peng’s post was immediately deleted and her presence scrubbed from China’s strictly censored web.In late November, Chinese state media released Peng’s photos and videos, following the release of an email purportedly written by her, to claim that the tennis player was safe but wanted to be left alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/peng-shuai-china-opposes-politicisation-of-sports-101638445882850.html
02-12-2021||World||China summons Japan envoy over ex-PM’s Taiwan remarks||China’s foreign ministry summoned Japan’s ambassador for an “emergency meeting” on Wednesday to lodge its protest after former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe said neither Tokyo nor Washington could stand by if China attacked Taiwan.Assistant foreign minister Hua Chunying said Abe’s remarks were “erroneous”, and a violation of basic norms of relations between China and Japan in the meeting with Japanese ambassador Hideo Tarumi in Beijing, according to a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry.“A Taiwan crisis would be a Japan crisis and therefore a crisis for the Japan-US alliance,” Abe said in an online speech on Wednesday.“It’s imperative that people in Beijing not misjudge that, and most especially President Xi Jinping,” he said.“Military adventure would lead to economic suicide,” Abe added.Describing Abe’s remarks as “extremely erroneous”, Hua said it was “a brutal interference in China’s internal affairs and challenged China’s sovereignty.”“His flagrant support to the ‘Taiwan independence’ forces seriously violated the basic norms of international relations and principles stipulated in the four political documents between China and Japan,” Hua said.“China is resolutely opposed to this,” Hua said, adding that China had made “stern representations” to Japan.Hua said Japan is a country that launched a war of aggression against China in history and committed heinous crimes against the Chinese people, and has no right to point fingers on the Taiwan question, according to state media.Abe’s remarks and China’s response indicate the growing tension in the region over Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy claimed by China as a breakaway region.“Japan, Taiwan and all the people who believe in democracy need to keep urging President Xi Jinping and other Chinese Communist Party leaders repeatedly not to step onto a wrong path,” Abe said, according to a Reuters report.Japan and Taiwan must work together to protect freedom and democracy, Japan’s former prime minister said.“A stronger Taiwan, a thriving Taiwan, and a Taiwan that guarantees freedom and human rights are also in Japan’s interests. Of course, this is also in the interests of the whole world,” Abe added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-summons-japan-envoy-over-ex-pm-s-taiwan-remarks-101638440362494.html
02-12-2021||World||Abe’s warning to China over Taiwan is a blunt message to President Xi||Former Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe’s upfront warning to China that Tokyo and Washington will not stand-by if Beijing attacked Taiwan is a message to President Xi Jinping to tone down his belligerence over Taipei.Speaking virtually at a forum organized by a Taiwanese think tank on Wednesday, Abe said: “An armed invasion of Taiwan would be a grave danger to Japan. A Taiwan emergency is a Japanese emergency, and therefore an emergency for the Japan-US alliance. People in Beijing, President Xi Jinping in particular, should not have a misunderstanding in recognizing this.” Abe is head of the largest faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and remains a very influential figure in the party and the Island nation.Former PM Abe’s statement came at a time when Japan has decided to upgrade and extend the capability of its cruise missiles to hit objects over 1000 kilometres from the present capability of 100-200 km. Developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the missiles will be deployed in the second half of this decade with multi-spectrum capability. Essentially, the Japanese plan is to deter the increased missile development competition in the Asia Pacific Region.Given the past legacy of Japan, China and South Korea will be uneasy with this missile development plan but the fact is that Beijing is in a hyper-aggressive mode in the region. It has already deployed intermediate-range ballistic missiles that can target any city in Japan and the US base in Guam. The Chinese propaganda media has nick-named these missiles ship killer and Guam killer.While the US has already made it clear that it would take (unspecified) action if China was to use force to alter the status of Taiwan, the Biden administration, aided by the US Congress, is considering a plan to deploy an intermediate-range ballistic missile network on the first Island chain connecting Okinawa (which has a US base) to Taiwan and Philippines.In the light of the above, Shinzo Abe statement should not be taken lightly as it makes it evident that Tokyo will shed its pacifist posture (enshrined in article nine of their constitution) if China continues to steamroll its hegemonistic agenda in the Asia Pacific as well as towards Indian sub-continent.Just as the PLA has increased the number of intermediate-range missile launchers to as high as 82 towards Asia-Pacific adversaries, it has also deployed long-range missiles in Tibet to pressurize India and subdue the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan. China has already started building an airbase in Burang county, just north of Lipu-Lekh pass, and it is only a matter of time when military aircraft and drones will be deployed at the new base. Already, the PLA has deployed two S-400 air defence systems against India in Tibet and three systems to handle the possible US-Japan threat on its eastern seaboard.Several China watchers believe that Beijing will become more aggressive towards Taiwan after the February 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing as it does not want any games boycott from the participating nations like US and Japan in the worst-case scenario. The situation on the India-China border in Ladakh is no different with Beijing continuing its Sinicization of Tibet and Xinjiang agenda and turning the Himalayan plateau into a fortress. The contested Senkaku Island chain is just 100 km from Taiwan and the Burang airport mere 400 km from Delhi. A two-front deterrence may force China to abandon its belligerent path as any adverse action can spiral into a global conflict.

Here is what we do and do not know about the issue.What is causing concern?The data, released by South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), shows that 52 infants under age 2 were among 452 Covid-19 patients admitted in Tshwane - the metropolitan area that includes the capital Pretoria - in the period between Nov. 14 and 28, a higher number than for any other age group.However, taking into account the size of the populations of the various age groups, the risk of admission was higher for people over age 60.Have the admissions been linked to Omicron?No. Only a small percentage of positive test samples in South Africa are being submitted for genomic sequencing to detect the variant due to limited capacity. That means we cannot know for sure whether the infants in hospital were infected with Omicron, NICD scientists have said.There is also uncertainty about whether all of the infants included in the data are infected with Covid-19, as not all are tested for the virus, scientists said.For practical reasons, infants who present with respiratory symptoms are treated as if they had Covid-19, but they could be sick with another disease such as flu.Omicron may not evade all immunity: 4 new findings by South African doctors, scientistsHow sick were the admitted infants?The data shows that 29% of Covid-19 admissions in the 0-to-4 age group had severe disease - a proportion similar to that in several other age groups, and significantly lower than the percentage of severe disease among patients over 60.Among those age 4 or younger, 1% of admissions resulted in death, according to the data. However, the total number of admissions in that group was 70, making it unclear what the 1% figure represents.The NICD did not respond to a query from Reuters about that and other elements of the data, saying it would issue a new report on paediatric admissions later this week.Should we worried about a potential Omicron link?Asked whether people should be alarmed by the infant admissions numbers, Professor Anne von Gottberg, clinical microbiologist at the NICD, told Reuters: "Not yet.""It looks like in fact some of those admissions might have started before the emergence of Omicron," she said. "We are concerned enough that we are looking at the data very, very carefully, but at the moment I'm not too sure that we can link it definitively to Omicron."How is Omicron detected? What is S-gene dropout? All you need to knowWhat else could be going on?The province of Gauteng, where Tshwane is located, has experienced an increase in flu cases in the past month."We need to be really careful to look at the other respiratory infections and diseases to work out why were children being admitted. Were they being tested as they were being admitted or was it precautionary?" said von Gottberg.NICD scientists also said that parents with sick babies and infants were quick to bring them to hospital, while patients in other age groups were less likely to rush in.When will we know more?The NICD said it was preparing a report on paediatric admissions which should be available by the end of the week.The World Health Organization said on Wednesday it expected to have data on Omicron's transmissibility within days, but scientists said it could take two-to-four weeks to learn more about the variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/does-omicron-pose-higher-risks-for-infants-than-other-coronavirus-variants-101638405630220.html

However, the number of daily Covid cases has doubled to 8,561.Mild or severe?South African doctors earlier said that they found mild diseases in Omicron cases. But scientists are saying it is still too early to determine whether going forward Omicron will only cause mild illness. The symptoms reported were mild as the cases were mostly reported in younger age groups but now older age groups are also becoming the target of this variant.Richard Lessells, an infectious disease specialist at the KRISP genomics institute, said the severity of disease caused by the new strain may also be masked by the fact that many people have already contracted other variants or have been inoculated, giving them some immunity.(With inputs from Reuters and Bloomberg)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-may-not-evade-all-immunity-4-new-findings-by-south-african-doctors-scientists-101638415401795.html

Neil Ferguson, the head of the disease outbreak analysis and modelling group at Imperial College London, told British parliamentarians that the threat posed by the Omicron variant will not be clear until the end of December, The Guardian reported.“The virus cares about replicating very fast within the respiratory tract and getting out into the environment. If that happens to kill somebody 10 days later the virus really doesn’t care,” Ferguson, who influenced the governments’ response around the world with his initial Covid-19 modelling, said.Omicron has prompted countries across the globe to tighten travel restrictions as uncertainty over the new B.1.1.529 variant grows. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned over the inequitable access of vaccines and overall low vaccine coverage globally as the highly transmissible Deta variant remains the dominant variant worldwide."Globally, we have a toxic mix of low vaccine coverage, and very low testing -- a recipe for breeding and amplifying variants," said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus."We need to use the tools we already have to prevent transmission and save lives from Delta. And if we do that, we will also prevent transmission and save lives from Omicron," he added.Covid in Chandigarh: South Africa returnee, wife have mild symptomsMeanwhile, the United States has confirmed its first case of Omicron variant in a traveller who has recently returned from South Africa.

What we know so far||The United States has announced its first confirmed case of Omicron, the new variant of Covid, in a traveller who has recently returned from South Africa. This is the first known case of the new variant, first identified by South African scientists, in the US, as several reports now suggest that the variant was present in Europe before South Africa reported the first case. Much about the new variant is not known yet, but its emergence has created fresh apprehension across the world with most of the countries putting travel restrictions.Here is what we know about US' 1st Omicron case:1. The traveller was fully vaccinated against Covid but did not receive any booster dose.2. The person returned from South Africa on November 22. All his contacts have tested negative.3. The person tested positive on November 29 and was in self-quarantine.4. At present, the patient is recovering from the symptoms. "We feel good that this patient not only had mild symptoms but actually the symptoms appear to be improving," US top health official Anthony Fauci said.WHO confirms Omicron Covid-19 variant in 23 countries. Here’s the full list5. The San Francisco health department and California's state health department jointly confirmed the case issuing a statement that the variant was found thanks to the state's testing and genome sequencing surveillance.6. According to reports, the passenger began her travel back to the United States on November 21 and landed in San Francisco on November 22.7. On November 25, the person experienced symptoms and three days later for testing. The sequencing was done by the University of California.8. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is not investigating any other potential Omicron cases in the US, reports said.9.
