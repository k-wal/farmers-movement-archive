The diversity of culture and religion in the tourism-dependent country has at times been at odds with its Islamic laws and traditions.But that's changing as the nation promotes its socially liberal environment to lure international workers. The government has reformed its Islamic legal code and next year will change its weekend to Saturday-Sunday to align with the Western businesses and markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-arab-emirates-to-end-censorship-of-cinematic-releases-101639937878548.html
19-12-2021||World||Omicron ‘raging through the world’, 'no doubt' about breakthrough infections: Fauci||Top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said the Omicron variant of coronavirus is “raging through the world” as he urged Americans to continue wearing masks and get a vaccine booster dose. Appearing for NBC’s ‘Meet the Press’, Fauci said the new variant of concern has the extraordinary capability of spreading, adding that the United States is going to see breakthrough infections."We are going to see breakthrough infection - there is no doubt about that," the top immunologist said.The White House medical adviser has, however, ruled out the possibility of complete lockdown.“I don’t foresee the kind of lockdowns that we’ve seen before but I certainly see the potential for stress on our hospital system,” he said in a separate interview with ABC’s “This Week.”Speaking to CNN, Fauci predicted that stress on the medical system will be particularly acute in regions with low levels of vaccination.Fauci’s remarks came a day the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed Omicron circulating in at least 89 countries. The UN health agency said Covid cases involving the new variant of concern are doubling every 1.5 to 3 days in places with community transmission. It warned that Omicron is likely to soon overtake Delta as the dominant variant in countries where local transmission has taken place.The worrying rate of transmission of the Omicron variant has prompted countries around the world to tighten travel restrictions. The United Kingdom has been witnessing a record number of confirmed cases of the new variant of concern. On Sunday, the UK Health Security Agency said an additional 12,133 cases of Omicron have been confirmed over the previous 24 hours, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 37,101.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-raging-through-the-world-no-doubt-about-breakthrough-infections-fauci-101639924722530.html
19-12-2021||World||'Afghanistan heading for chaos': Pak PM Imran Khan wants US to 'delink' Taliban||Afghanistan is heading for chaos if no action is taken immediately, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan warned on Sunday during his opening remarks at an extraordinary meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). He also sounded alarm bells regarding a possible refugee crisis and rise in Islamic State violence in case the international community doesn’t provide support to Afghan citizens."Unless action is taken immediately, Afghanistan is heading for chaos," Khan said. "Chaos suits no one."Afghanistan is facing a grave humanitarian crisis in the aftermath of the Taliban’s takeover as the United States froze billions of dollars in central bank reserves and imposed sanctions, causing many institutions and governments to shy away from direct dealings with the hardline Islamists. The special two-day meeting of OIC members in Pakistan seek to respond to the growing crises."I speak to the United States specifically that they must delink the Afghanistan government from the 40 million Afghan citizens," he said, "even if they have been in conflict with the Taliban for 20 years."The Taliban's acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi assured the members that the new setup in Kabul has restored peace and security, claiming that they have also addressed the demands of a more inclusive government. He stressed that countries must acknowledge that the “political isolation of Afghanistan is not beneficial for anyone.”“Therefore it is imperative that all support the prevailing stability and back it both politically and economically," he said, as quoted by Reuters.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-heading-for-chaos-pak-pm-imran-khan-wants-us-to-delink-taliban-101639919732596.html

It displaced more than 400,000 people, damaged homes and toppled power and communication lines.The national disaster agency had already reported 31 casualties following the storm, but those figures did not include casualties in Bohol. The agency said it was still awaiting official reports from Bohol and other regions.In the southern province of Dinagat Islands, the local government on Sunday reported 10 deaths, but it was also unclear if those fatalities had already been included in the official tally from the disaster agency.Most deaths were due to fallen trees and drowning, officials said.The widespread destruction has made it difficult for authorities to immediately provide a clear picture about the extent of damage, as communication and power lines have yet to be fully restored in many areas.Rai, which at one point was a category 5 storm, made nine landfalls, with a massive trail of destruction also reported in the provinces of Cebu, Leyte, Surigao del Norte, including the popular Siargao surfing destination, and Dinagat Islands.It uprooted trees, toppled roofs, flattened houses, destroyed infrastructure and flooded many towns, hampering efforts to send much needed food and water to victims.The directive from President Rodrigo Duterte was to "use all government resources to ensure that all goods are delivered as soon as possible" to calamity-stricken areas, presidential spokesperson Karlo Nograles told a radio station.Rai had displaced nearly 490,000 people in the Philippines before it moved toward the South China Sea over the weekend.In Bohol, home to some of the country's popular tourist destinations, such as the Loboc River, which overflowed, Governor Arthur Yap said the number of deaths was based only on partial reports, suggesting the death toll could still rise."It is very clear that the damage sustained by Bohol is great and all-encompassing," he said in video posted on his Facebook account. "People have suffered greatly in terms of destroyed homes and agricultural losses."About 20 tropical storms hit the Philippines every year, usually causing floods and landslides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-due-to-typhoon-rai-rises-to-100-in-philippines-101639914374145.html
19-12-2021||World||Omicron spread: These European countries have tightened Covid restrictions during Christmas||The rising cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), fuelled by the Omicron variant, in Europe has prompted several countries in the region to take precautionary measures to prevent another outbreak.Omicron is spreading across the sovereign and thriving in busy cities like London. A two-week “circuit-breaker” lockdown plan has been devised to be implemented post-Christmas to prevent widespread damage across the country, as per The Times.Experts have predicted there may be more than 3,000 hospitalisations in the United Kingdom each day if a lockdown isn’t implemented by January 1.Health minister Sajid Javid said on Sunday analysis of the data suggested around 60% of all new Covid-19 cases in England are the fast-spreading Omicron variant, but the country was in a better position than last Christmas thanks to things such as vaccinations and testing."We will do what is necessary but it has got to be backed up by the data ... we are watching the data, discussing it with our scientists and our best advisers almost on an hourly basis and we will monitor that very carefully we will keep the situation under review."Also Read| UK health minister declines to commit stricter Covid rules amid lockdown reportsAfter an increase in Covid-19 cases with a hike of more than 15,000 infections daily in the Netherlands, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced the country will be going into lockdown over the Christmas period.All non-essential restaurants, shops, bars, cinemas and theatres will be closed in the country from December 19 to January 14. Only two guests would be allowed to visit a house during this period, with exception of four guests on Christmas, Christmas Eve and New Year.“All this, exactly one week before Christmas. Another Christmas that is completely different from what we want. Very bad news again for all those businesses and cultural institutions that rely on the holidays,” Prime Minister Rutte said.Also Read| Netherlands 'going into lockdown again' to curb OmicronAccording to German health minister Karl Lauterbach, Germany’s health service is worried about a “massive fifth wave” coming from the Omicron variant.Travellers from the UK have been banned from entering the country, except for German nationals who regardless of their vaccination status, must quarantine for two weeks and get a negative Covid test.France has implemented similar curbs on Saturday, by banning tourists from Britain from journeying between the two countries.Also Read| Covid: Germany hits UK travellers with new restrictionsSpain’s coronavirus disease cases have risen to a ‘very high risk’ level.

19-12-2021||World||Over 30,000 people displaced amid Malaysia's worst flooding in years||More than 30,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Malaysia on Sunday as the country battles some of its worst flooding in years.The tropical Southeast Asian nation often sees stormy monsoon seasons towards the end of the year, with flooding regularly prompting mass evacuations.Downpours since Friday have caused rivers to overflow, submerging many urban areas and cutting off major roads, leaving thousands of motorists stranded.More than 30,000 flood victims across eight states and territories were recorded on an official government website, with over 14,000 of them in the central state of Pahang.Nearly 10,000 people fled their homes in the country's richest state of Selangor -- which surrounds the capital Kuala Lumpur -- with Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob expressing surprise at the severe flooding there."The amount of rain that fell in Selangor yesterday, what fell in one day would usually fall in one month," he told a Sunday press conference.The premier promised swift aid for the flood victims and initial funding of 100 million ringgit ($23.7 million) to repair damaged houses and infrastructure.A government website showed water exceeding dangerous levels in six central and northeastern states Sunday afternoon.As floodwaters receded from the capital, business owners went back to their shops to clean up the damage left by the downpours.Lee Joon Kee, the owner of a tourist information centre and souvenir shop, said he had only reopened a few days ago after closing for nearly two years due to coronavirus restrictions."It's very sad but we have no choice. The only choice (we have is) to move on and clean out the mess, then we will continue our new chapter."Dozens of bus routes in and around the capital have been suspended along with train services to the port city of Klang.Operations at three water treatment plants in Selangor were also disrupted, with taps expected to run dry for tens of thousands of people in parts of the state as well as the capital.Malaysia's worst flooding in decades took place in 2014, forcing about 118,000 people to flee their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-30-000-people-displaced-amid-malaysia-s-worst-flooding-in-years-101639910413618.html
19-12-2021||World||UK health minister declines to commit stricter Covid rules amid lockdown reports||UK health secretary Sajid Javid on Sunday declined to commit to stricter rules to contain Omicron variant after top scientific advisers recommended stringent measures in view of resurgence of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. Speaking to Sky News, Javid argued the government needs to strike a balance between scientific advice and the impact of stringent measures like lockdown on businesses and people.“We will keep the situation under review, but I can’t stress enough how the situation today in terms of our defences is very different,” he said, referring to the high vaccination rate and expansion of the booster program.On Saturday, British media reported that the government was drawing up plans for a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown after Christmas to break the chain of the new, highly-transmissible variant of concern. Citing the minutes of a meeting of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the reports suggested that draft regulations were being drawn up to ban indoor mixing except for work purposes.UK's confirmed Omicron tally jumps by 10,000 cases in 24 hours; now at 24,968UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was reportedly presented with a number of options ranging from "mild guidance to nudge people, right through to lockdown". The Sage advised that strong measures are needed without any delay to prevent the number of daily hospitalisations from reaching the levels of January when Britain was reporting over 3,700 hospital admissions a day."If the aim is to reduce the levels of infection in the population and prevent hospitalisations reaching these levels, more stringent measures would need to be implemented very soon," the Sage minutes said, as quoted by BBC.Highlighting the high vaccination coverage and booster program, the UK health secretary said the government would “recall parliament” if there was a “need to take any further action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-health-minister-declines-to-commit-stricter-covid-rules-amid-lockdown-reports-101639909458724.html

On Aug. 24 alone, 709 people died of the illness. The number of deaths has decreased in recent months due to the vaccination, experts say.Iran accelerated vaccinations in recent weeks. More than 50 million Iranians have received their second shots, and 3.5 million have received the third shots.Only 7 million Iranians had received vaccinations when President Ebrahin Raisi formed his administration in late August.Iran generally uses the China-made Sinopharm vaccine, though the Russian Sputnik-V and the vaccine made by the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca are also in use.Iranian officials urged people who got two doses of vaccine to get their third dose as soon as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-reports-first-case-of-omicron-variant-of-covid-19-report-101639907901488.html
19-12-2021||World||Hundreds queue for passports in bid to leave Afghanistan||Hundreds of people braved sub-zero temperatures in Afghanistan's capital to queue outside the passport office early Sunday, a day after the Taliban government announced it would resume issuing travel documents.Many began their wait the previous night and most stood patiently in single file -- some desperate to leave the country for medical treatment, others to escape the Islamists' renewed rule.Tense Taliban personnel periodically charged crowds that formed at the front of the queue and at a nearby roadblock."We don't want any suicide attack or explosion to happen," said Taliban security operative Ajmal Toofan, 22, expressing concerns about the dangers of crowding.The local branch of the Islamic State group, the Taliban's principal enemy, killed more than 150 people in late August when citizens massed at Kabul airport in a desperate bid to leave during the early days of the new regime."Our responsibility here is to protect people," Toofan added calmly, his gun pointed professionally towards the ground. "But the people are not cooperating."He spoke to AFP as one of his colleagues pushed a man who then fell headlong just short of a coil of barbed wire.Mohammed Osman Akbari, 60, said he was urgently trying to reach Pakistan, because dilapidated hospitals at home were unable to complete his heart surgery.Medics "put springs in my heart", he said, referring to a stent. "They need to be removed and it's not possible here."Nearby, ambulances containing people too sick to queue were parked at the side of the road."The patient has a heart problem," said ambulance driver Muslim Fakhri, 21, referring to a 43-year-old man lying on a stretcher inside his vehicle.An applicant has to be present to ensure the passport is issued, he explained.'No one cares'The Taliban initially stopped issuing passports shortly after their return to power, which came as the previous, Western-backed regime imploded in the final stages of a US military withdrawal.In October, authorities reopened the passport office in Kabul only to suspend workdays later as a flood of applications caused the biometric equipment to break down.But the office said Saturday that the issue has been resolved and those whose applications were already in the process can now get their documents.Mursal Rasooli, 26, said she was happy to hear the news."The situation here is not peaceful," she told AFP, hugging her two-year-old daughter Bibi Hawa close for dual relief against the biting cold."If the situation gets worse than this, then we have the passport" and can flee, she said.Her husband is in Iran because he could not find work here, she added, before expressing concern about skyrocketing prices and a lack of jobs and education for women and girls.Issuing passports -- and allowing people to leave amid a humanitarian crisis the UN has called an "avalanche of hunger" -- is seen as a test of the Taliban's commitment to the international community.The Taliban are meanwhile pressing donors to restore billions of dollars in aid that was suspended when they came to power.Local musician Omid Naseer, sporting a leather jacket, short beard and unkempt hair, was desperate to leave.For "months now, since the Taliban came (to power), we've had no work", he said."The artists are most vulnerable, but no one cares."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-queue-for-passports-in-bid-to-leave-afghanistan-101639903419460.html

Yehuda Dimentman, 25, was killed and two others were wounded near Homesh, which is considered illegal by the Israeli government.The army said the suspects were arrested in the northern West Bank village of Silat al-Haaretia, near Jenin, and “were transferred to the security forces for further investigation and the weapon of the suspect who carried out the shooting was captured.”The Israeli authorities did not immediately identify the suspects.The Israeli border police released a photo of a cache of assault rifles and ammunition it said belonged to the suspects.Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett congratulated the security forces for the arrest, adding that “every terrorist should know that the state of Israel will settle the score with him.”The developments come after weeks of spiking Israeli-Palestinian violence. Earlier this month, a Palestinian attacker stabbed and seriously wounded an ultra-Orthodox Jew outside Jerusalem’s Old City. And just over a week before that, a Hamas militant opened fire in the Old City, killing an Israeli man.At the same time, settler violence against Palestinians has risen, particularly in the northern West Bank.Israel captured east Jerusalem and the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, and the territories are now home to over 700,000 Israel settlers. Most of the international community considers Israeli settlements illegal obstacles to peace.The Palestinians seek east Jerusalem and the West Bank as parts of a future independent state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-military-arrests-4-palestinian-suspects-in-dec-16-west-bank-shooting-101639900274799.html

The passengers are yet to be identified.Police inspector Craig White described it as a "tragic accident" in the lead-up to Christmas."This is the last thing that any family need to go through this time of the year," he said.Local media images showed the four-seater plane upside down in the water.Early reports indicated it crashed shortly after take-off, authorities said, but a full investigation had been ordered to determine the cause.The Air Transport Safety Bureau said additional investigators would be sent from the national capital Canberra to assist in the probe.Queensland police commissioner Katarina Carroll earlier told local media the initial response had encountered challenging conditions."The plane is in a very, very difficult situation, (a) difficult position in the wetland area," she said.Authorities said it could take some time to retrieve the wreckage from the crash site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/plane-crash-in-australia-kills-4-including-two-children-101639892910442.html
19-12-2021||World||Aid for Afghanistan discussed in Islamic countries meet||Envoys from 57 Islamic nations were meeting in Pakistan Sunday for a summit aimed at relieving the humanitarian crisis in neighbouring Afghanistan while testing diplomatic ties with its new Taliban rulers.The meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation is the biggest major conference on Afghanistan since the US-backed government fell in August.After the Taliban's lightning return to power, billions of dollars in aid and assets were frozen by the international community, and the nation of 38 million now faces a bitter winter.The United Nations has repeatedly warned that Afghanistan is on the brink of the world's worst humanitarian emergency with a combined food, fuel and cash crisis.On Sunday Pakistan's capital was on lockdown, ring-fenced with barbed wire barriers and shipping-container roadblocks where police and soldiers stood guard.Any aid pledges were set to be announced Sunday evening.Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is among the delegates, alongside others from the United States, China, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations.No nations have yet formally recognised the Taliban government and diplomats face the delicate task of channelling aid to the stricken Afghan economy without also propping up the hardline Islamists.Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the meeting would speak "for the people of Afghanistan" rather than "a particular group".Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were the only three countries to recognise the previous Taliban government of 1996 to 2001.Qureshi said there was a difference between "recognition and engagement" with the new order in Kabul."Let us nudge them through persuasion, through incentives, to move in the right direction," he told reporters ahead of the OIC meeting."A policy of coercion and intimidation did not work. If it had worked, we wouldn't have been in this situation."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aid-for-afghanistan-discussed-in-islamic-countries-meet-101639890432596.html
19-12-2021||World||Typhoon Rai death toll in Philippines nearing 100||The governor of an island province in the central Philippines said at least 49 people died in the devastation wrought by Typhoon Rai in just half of the towns that managed to contact him, bringing the death toll in the strongest typhoon to batter the country this year to nearly 100.Gov. Arthur Yap of Bohol province said 10 other people were missing and 13 injured, and suggested the death toll may still considerably increase with many mayors unable to reach him due to downed communications.In a statement posted on Facebook early Sunday, Yap ordered provincial mayors to spend money to rapidly secure food packs and drinking water, which was an urgent problem given that water stations have not been able to operate during power outage.After joining a military aerial survey of typhoon-ravaged towns, Yap said “it is very clear that the damage sustained by Bohol is great and all-encompassing.”He said the inspection did not cover four towns, where the typhoon blew in as it rampaged on Thursday and Friday through central island provinces. The government said about 780,000 people were affected, including more than 300,000 residents who had to evacuate their homes.At least 39 other typhoon deaths were reported by the disaster-response agency and the national police. Officials on Dinagat Islands, one of the southeastern provinces first pounded by the typhoon, separately reported 10 deaths just from a few towns, bringing the overall fatalities so far to 98.President Rodrigo Duterte flew to the region Saturday and promised 2 billion pesos ($40 million) in new aid.At its strongest, the typhoon packed sustained winds of 195 kilometers (121 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 270 kph (168 mph), one of the most powerful in recent years to hit the disaster-prone archipelago, which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea.Floodwaters rose rapidly in Bohol’s riverside town of Loboc, where residents were trapped on their roofs and trees. They were rescued by the coast guard the following day. On Dinagat Islands, an official said the roofs of nearly all the houses, including emergency shelters, were either damaged or blown away.At least 227 cities and towns lost electricity, which has since been restored in only 21 areas, officials said, adding three regional airports were damaged, including two that remain closed.The deaths and widespread damage left by the typhoon ahead of Christmas in the largely Roman Catholic nation brought back memories of the catastrophe inflicted by another typhoon, Haiyan, one of the most powerful on record.

Only 21 mayors out of 48 have reached out to us," Yap said, raising fears the death toll could rise in the flood-hit province.Thousands of military, police, coast guard and fire personnel are being deployed to assist in search and rescue efforts in the worst-affected areas.A Philippine Navy ship carrying goods and other relief would depart for Bohol on Monday, Yap said, after he earlier declared a state of calamity on the island.There has also been widespread destruction on Siargao, Dinagat and Mindanao islands, which bore the brunt of Rai when it slammed into the Philippines.Aerial photos shared by the military showed severe damage in the Siargao town of General Luna, where many surfers and holidaymakers had flocked ahead of Christmas, with buildings stripped of roofs and debris littering the ground.Dinagat Governor Arlene Bag-ao said Saturday the damage to the island's landscape was "reminiscent if not worse" than that caused by Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.Haiyan, which is called Yolanda in the Philippines, was the deadliest cyclone on record in the country, leaving more than 7,300 people dead or missing.Rai's wind speeds eased to 150 kph as it barrelled across the country, dumping torrential rain that inundated villages, uprooting trees and shattering wooden structures.It emerged over the South China Sea on Saturday and headed towards Vietnam.The Philippines -- ranked one of the world's most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change -- is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons every year, which typically wipe out harvests, homes and infrastructure in already impoverished areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-climbs-to-75-in-philippines-typhoon-reports-officials-101639883795464.html
19-12-2021||World||Omicron looms large in Britain: Cases surge in 24 hours, London rings the alarm||The Omicron variant of the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus is spreading at a remarkable pace in the United Kingdom (UK). According to British government data, a marked surge in cases was reported in a span of mere 24 hours. Moreover, London's mayor Sadiq Khan has also declared a “major incident” to help the city's hospitals cope with the Omicron surge.The UK health security agency (UKHSA) said that the number of Omicron cases recorded across Britain hit almost 25,000 by Friday evening, an increase of more than 10,000 cases from 24 hours earlier.To make matters worse, as many as seven people, who were believed to have been infected with the Omicron variant, died as of Thursday, up from the one death in the UKHSA's previous data which ran up to Tuesday. Hospitalisation numbers also increased during this span – admissions of people thought to have been infected with Omicron increased to 85 from 65.However, the real number of Omicron cases eludes government data, authorities acknowledged. Hundreds of thousands of people were “almost certainly” being infected with the variant every day and were not being picked up in the figures, the British government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) said.If the current trend for the Omicron surge continues in England, a peak of at least 3,000 hospital admissions per day is to be expected, SAGE said, advising a further tightening of coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-necessitated rules.  Notably, daily hospitalisations in the UK had surged above 4,000 last January, before the nationwide vaccination programme gathered steam and brought the numbers down.London declares ‘major emergency’ over OmicronMeanwhile, London mayor Sadiq Khan declared a “major incident” over Omicron to allow for closer coordination between public agencies and possibly more central government support, as Covid-19 hospital admissions in the city rose by nearly 30 per cent this week.London has now logged the highest number of new Covid-19 cases since the start of the pandemic – over 26,000.“I've taken the decision, in consultation with our partners, to declare a major incident today,” Khan, the city's mayor, said in a Sky News broadcast.Germany puts UK on list of high-risk countriesGermany's health authority announced late Saturday that Britain had been added to its list of Covid high-risk countries, which will mean tighter travel restrictions.“The United Kingdom and Northern Ireland are very strongly affected by Covid-19. A new variant, very contagious, has also been found,” the Germany Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on its website.The change, which takes effect at the end of the day Sunday at midnight, means arrivals from Britain will have to observe a two-week quarantine regardless of whether they are vaccinated, said the country's health agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI).In addition to the quarantine measure, only German nationals or foreigners residing in Germany will be allowed to come to the country from Britain. The rule applies to all means of transport and a PCR test will be required for all persons travelling to Germany.  (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-looms-large-in-britain-cases-surge-in-24-hours-london-rings-the-alarm-101639880167455.html
19-12-2021||World||Pakistan to hold summit of OIC leaders to discuss Afghan humanitarian crisis||Pakistan is set to host the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) summit on Sunday to discuss the Afghanistan situation and help the war-ravaged country garner humanitarian assistance as its economy remains in shambles after the pull out of the US troops and the subsequent takeover by the Taliban government. Pakistan is also aiming to soften the Taliban's image globally and pave the way for the global acceptance of their government in Kabul.In addition to the members of the OIC, delegations from the United States, Russia, United Kingdom, the European Union, the World Bank and humanitarian organisations have also been invited to the conference. Afghanistan's acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi also arrived in Islamabad on Saturday to attend the summit.According to local media, the summit will have various sessions focused on Afghanistan. During this, the leaders will discuss ways to mobilise support for providing adequate food, medicine, and shelter to millions of people in Afghanistan who are in dire need after the fall of Kabul in mid-August.Taliban took over Afghanistan in a military offensive in the aftermath of troop withdrawal from Afghanistan by the United States and its other Nato allies. The chaotic exit led to a major humanitarian crisis for Afghanistan as it brought the country back to 1991 when the group was ousted by the US troops.The country is now on the verge of economic collapse as the international community froze billions of dollars worth of assets abroad and stopped all assistance. Afghanistan is also facing a threat from the Islamic State, which has ramped up attacks in the country over the last few months.It has been more than 100 days since the Taliban seized control over Afghanistan but it has not been recognised by any nation of the world yet.On Saturday, Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the message to the gathering is: "Please do not abandon Afghanistan. Please engage. We are speaking for the people of Afghanistan. We're not speaking of a particular group. We are talking about the people of Afghanistan," news agency AP reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-hold-summit-of-oic-leaders-to-discuss-afghan-humanitarian-crisis-101639878821152.html

It laid out for the first time in detail demands that it says are essential for lowering tensions in Europe and defusing a crisis over Ukraine.“I think we did not hit the lowest point, thank God, and there is a progress in some aspects at the very least and not everything is hopeless,” Interfax news agency quoted Ryabkov as saying on Saturday. Moscow needs stable and predictable relations with Washington, he said.“The situation can be stabilized and improved with the help of such agreements. Without them the situation will remain extremely difficult and tense,” Ryabkov said, Interfax reported.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Friday that the US is prepared for dialogue with Russia over its security demands and will present its own concerns.Nuclear-capable bombers on patrol over BelarusA pair of nuclear-capable Russian long-range bombers patrolled the skies over Belarus on a mission Saturday intended to underline close defence ties between the two allies amid tensions with the West.The Russian defence ministry said two Tu-22M3 flew a four-hour mission to practice “performing joint tasks with the Belarusian air force and air defense.” The bombers were escorted by Belarus’ Su-30 fighter jets, which Russia has supplied to its ally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/security-proposals-can-fix-relations-with-us-official-101639868176164.html

A governor said her island has been “leveled to the ground."Typhoon Rai blew away Friday night into the South China Sea after rampaging through southern and central island provinces, where more than 300,000 people in its path were evacuated to safety in advance in a pre-emptive move officials say may have saved a lot of lives.At its strongest, Rai packed sustained winds of 195 kilometers (121 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 270 kph (168 mph), one of the most powerful in recent years to hit the disaster-prone Southeast Asian archipelago, which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. The typhoon slammed into the country's southeastern coast Thursday but the extent of casualties and destruction remained unclear two days after with entire provinces still without power and cellphone connection.The government's main disaster-response agency said at least 31 people were reported killed, many after being hit by falling trees, but it added it was validating most of the deaths. At least three were injured and one was missing.Officials on Dinagat Islands, one of the first provinces to be lashed by the typhoon's ferocious winds, remained cut off Saturday due to downed power and communication lines. But its governor, Arlene Bag-ao, managed to post a statement on the province's website to say that the island of about 180,000 “has been leveled to the ground.” She pleaded for food, water, temporary shelters, fuel, hygiene kits and medical supplies. She said only a few casualties have been reported in the capital so far because other towns remain isolated.“We may have survived, but we cannot do the same in the coming days because of our limited capacities as an island province,” Bag-ao said, adding some of Dinagat's hospitals could not open due to damage. “Most of our commercial and cargo vessels ... are now unsuitable for sea voyages, effectively cutting us off from the rest of the country.”Vice Gov. Nilo Demerey managed to reach a nearby province and told DZMM radio network that at least six residents died and that “almost 95% of houses in Dinagat have no roof,” and even emergency shelters were destroyed.“We're currently doing repairs because even our evacuation centers were destroyed. There are no shelters, the churches, gymnasium, schools, public markets and even the capitol were all shattered,” Demerey said.Pictures posted on Dinagat's website show low-slung houses with roofs either blown off or damaged and surrounded by tin roof sheets and debris. The nearby island of Siargao, known as the surfing capital of the Philippines, also was pummeled by the typhoon.In central Bohol province, which was directly hit by the typhoon, the coast guard said its personnel on board rubber boats rescued residents who were trapped on roofs and trees, as waters rose rapidly. It released footage showing coast guard staff helping people from the roof of a house nearly engulfed by brownish floodwater to a rubber boat. They also help a villager climb down from a tree above the floodwater while another man, also wearing an orange life vest, waits for his turn.With government contingency funds used for the coronavirus pandemic, President Rodrigo Duterte said he would look for money to help the provinces. He planned to visit the devastated region this weekend.About 20 storms and typhoons batter the Philippines each year. The archipelago is located in the seismically active Pacific “Ring of Fire” region, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-leaves-31-dead-many-homes-roofless-in-philippines-101639867185986.html
19-12-2021||World||‘Omicron spreading faster than Delta’||The Omicron variant of the coronavirus is spreading significantly faster than the Delta strain in countries with documented community transmission, with a doubling time of 1.5–3 days, the World Health Organization said on Saturday.The Omicron variant, which was designated as a variant of concern on November 26, has been identified in 89 countries across all six WHO regions as of December 16, it said.Omicron is spreading rapidly in countries with high levels of population immunity, but it is unclear if this is due to the virus’ ability to evade immunity, its inherent increased transmissibility or a combination of both, the WHO said in an update.“There are still limited data on the clinical severity of Omicron,” the WHO said. “More data are needed to understand the severity profile and how severity is impacted by vaccination and pre-existing immunity.”It added, “There are still limited available data, and no peer-reviewed evidence, on vaccine efficacy or effectiveness to date for Omicron”.The WHO warned that with cases rising so rapidly, hospitals could be overwhelmed in some places.“Hospitalisations in the UK and South Africa continue to rise, and given rapidly increasing case counts, it is possible that many healthcare systems may become quickly overwhelmed.”Seven to 10% of new confirmed coronavirus cases in France are suspected to be of new the Omicron variant, health minister Olivier Veran said on Saturday.He said the rapid spread of the new variant was the main reason for the planned introduction of a new vaccination pass early next year, which will require that people show proof of vaccination to enter restaurants and long-distance public transport.Under the current health pass regulation, a recent negative Covid test is sufficient for entering public places. France is also set to curb New Year’s Eve celebrations.New York state reported a one-day record of more than 21,000 infections as the spread of the Omicron variant accelerates across the US.London declares ‘major incident’ to aid hospitalsBritain reported a surge in cases of the fast-spreading Omicron coronavirus variant on Saturday, and London’s mayor declared a “major incident” to help the capital’s hospitals following a sharp rise in Covid-19 admissions.The total number of Omicron cases recorded across the country hit almost 25,000 as of 7:00pm on Friday, up by more than 10,000 cases from 24 hours earlier, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said in its latest data. Seven people believed to have had the Omicron variant had died as of Thursday, up from one death in the UKHSA’s previous data which ran up to Tuesday. Hospitalisations of people thought to have the variant increased to 85 from 65.London Mayor Sadiq Khan declared a “major incident” - which allows for closer coordination between different public agencies and possibly more central government support - as Covid-19 hospital admissions in the city rose by nearly 30% this week. He said health worker absences had also increased.Sky News said government ministers were being briefed on the latest coronavirus data on Saturday. The Times newspaper reported that officials were preparing draft new rules that, if introduced, would ban indoor mixing in England except for work for two weeks after Christmas when pubs and restaurants would be limited to table service outdoors.People would be able to meet in groups of up to six outdoors, the newspaper said. But ministers were yet to formally consider the plans, The Times said.China’s local cases rise to highest this monthChina reported 125 new coronavirus cases for Friday, of which 89 are local, according to the National Health Commission.That’s the biggest daily tally for local infections since November 30 when the country had 91 domestic cases, all in Inner Mongolia. The nation is facing heightened pressure as it seeks to stamp out recent flareups of the Delta variant, while having detected its first Omicron cases, putting its Covid Zero approach to the test.The latest outbreak forced closures of more than a dozen factories in China’s eastern manufacturing hub of Zhejiang province, the epicentre.Separately, Australia’s most populous state of New South Wales reported a record 2,482 Covid-19 cases Saturday, a day after easing international arrival rules for vaccinated travellers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-spreading-faster-than-delta-101639866904426.html
19-12-2021||World||UK Brexit supremo Frost resigns in blow to Johnson||Britain's Brexit minister David Frost has resigned due to disillusionment with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government, including the imposition of tax rises and additional Covid-19 restrictions, the Mail on Sunday newspaper reported."Frost has sensationally resigned from Boris Johnson's government," the newspaper said.Downing Street did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The newspaper said Frost's departure had been prompted by the introduction of additional Covid-19 measures, including Covid-19 passes, a broader discontent with tax rises and the cost of 'net zero' environmental policies.The departure of the British government's most senior Brexit negotiator is yet another blow to Johnson who has faced warnings from some of his own lawmakers that he must improve his leadership or face a challenge.Johnson said on Friday he took personal responsibility for the loss of a Conservative stronghold in an election defeat that showed public dismay over a litany of scandals and stepped up pressure from mutinous lawmakers.Frost, a supporter of Brexit, has led the attempts by London to renegotiate the terms of Britain's exit from the European Union."Lord Frost tendered his resignation a week ago - but was persuaded to stay until January," the newspaper said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-brexit-supremo-frost-resigns-in-blow-to-johnson-101639862557994.html
19-12-2021||World||Netherlands 'going into lockdown again' to curb Omicron||Nations across Europe moved to reimpose tougher measures to stem a new wave of Covid-19 infections spurred by the highly transmissible omicron variant, including a new nationwide lockdown introduced by the Dutch government.Schools, universities, and all non-essential stores, bars and restaurants in the Netherlands will be closed until Jan. 14 starting Sunday, caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Saturday night. Residents only will be permitted two visitors except for Christmas and New Year's, when four will be allowed, he said.“The Netherlands is going into lockdown again from tomorrow,” Rutte said, adding that the move was “unavoidable because of the fifth wave caused by the omicron variant that is bearing down on us.”Before the Dutch announcement, alarmed ministers in France, Cyprus and Austria tightened travel restrictions. Paris canceled its New Year's Eve fireworks. Denmark closed theaters, concert halls, amusement parks and museums. Ireland imposed an 8 p.m. curfew on pubs and bars and limited attendance at indoor and outdoor events.London Mayor Sadiq Khan underscored the official concern about the climbing cases and their potential to overwhelm the health care system by declaring a major incident Saturday, a move that allows local councils in Britain's capital to coordinate work more closely with emergency services.Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin captured the sense of the continent in an address to the nation, saying the new restrictions were needed to protect lives and livelihoods from the resurgent virus.“None of this is easy,” Martin said Friday night. “We are all exhausted with Covid-19 and the restrictions it requires. The twists and turns, the disappointments and the frustrations take a heavy toll on everyone. But it is the reality that we are dealing with.”The World Health Organization reported Saturday that the omicron variant of the coronavirus has been detected in 89 countries, and Covid-19 cases involving the variant are doubling every 1.5 to 3 days in places with community transmission and not just infections acquired abroad.Major questions about omicron remain unanswered, including how effective existing Covid-19 vaccines are against it and whether the variant produces severe illness in many infected individuals, WHO noted.Yet omicron’s “substantial growth advantage” over the delta variant means it is likely to soon overtake delta as the dominant form of the virus in countries where the new variant is spreading locally, the UN health agency said.In the Netherlands, anticipation a government meeting Saturday would result in tougher restrictions caused shoppers to swarm commercial areas of Dutch cities, fearing it would be their last chance to buy Christmas gifts.Rotterdam municipality tweeted that it was “too busy in the center” of the port city and told people: “Don’t come to the city.” Amsterdam also warned that the city’s main shopping street was busy and urged people to stick to coronavirus rules.In the U.K., where confirmed daily cases soared to record numbers this week, the government has reimposed a requirement for masks to be worn indoors and ordered people to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative coronavirus test when going to nightclubs and large events.But the moves are causing anger.Critics of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s latest coronavirus restrictions flooded Oxford Street, a popular London shopping area, on Saturday. The maskless protesters blew whistles, yelled “Freedom!” and told passersby to remove their face coverings.Hundreds of people blocked traffic as they marched with signs bearing slogans such as “Vaccine passports kill our freedoms” and “Don’t comply.” Other signs had the faces of Johnson or U.K. Health Secretary Sajid Javid and read, “Give them the boot.”Scientists are warning the British government it needs to go further to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed.Leaked minutes from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies suggested a ban on indoor mixing and hospitality, the BBC reported.Britain and other nations are also accelerating the pace of booster shots after early data showed that two doses of vaccine were less effective against the omicron variant. Shopping centers, cathedrals and soccer stadiums in Britain have been converted into mass vaccination centers.During a visit to a mass vaccination pop-up clinic at London soccer team Chelsea's stadium on Saturday, Khan said the running of public services could be impeded by the rapidly spreading variant.“The big issue we have is the number of Londoners who have this virus and that’s leading to big issues in relation to staff absences and the ability of our public services to run at the optimum levels,'' he told the BBC. “I’m incredibly worried about staff absences in the (National Health Service), in the fire brigade, in the police service, in our councils across London.''Omicron is now the dominant coronavirus variant in London and efforts were stepped up to reach people who haven't yet been vaccinated or boosted.“I want to make a direct appeal to the more than 1 million Londoners who are yet to come forward for any Covid-19 vaccinations — it’s never too late to get your first or second dose,'' the mayor said. “It will help to protect you, your loved ones and our NHS.”In France, the government announced that it will start giving the vaccine to children in the 5 to 11 age group beginning Wednesday. Prime Minister Jean Castex said Friday that with the omicron variant spreading like “lightning,” the government proposed requiring proof of vaccination for those entering restaurants, cafes and other public establishments. The pending measure requires parliamentary approval.Demonstrations were planned in Paris to oppose the vaccine pass proposal and ongoing government restrictions.Thousands of opponents of vaccine requirements and mask mandates protested Saturday in Hamburg, Berlin, Düsseldorf and other German cities. In Austria, local media reported the crowds swelled to tens of thousands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netherlands-going-into-lockdown-again-to-curb-omicron-101639854437345.html
