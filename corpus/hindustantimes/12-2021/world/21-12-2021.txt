But he left open the prospect they could be introduced before Dec. 25, leaving millions of people uncertain about their Christmas plans.Members of his cabinet including Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak wanted to see more data about the severity of omicron and how cases translate into hospitalizations before agreeing to economy-damaging rules. Sunak on Tuesday unveiled 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) of fresh assistance to hospitality, leisure and cultural businesses, recognizing that even without a lockdown, they’ve suffered a big hit to their revenues caused by Britons limiting social interactions as omicron takes hold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-johnson-says-tighter-covid-19-rules-before-christmas-unlikely-101640107752526.html

In August, it conducted a successful test flight of Fatah-1, a Pakistan-made guided multi-launch rocket system capable of delivering conventional warheads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/babar-cruise-missile-s-enhanced-range-version-successfully-test-fired-by-pak-101640107007603.html
21-12-2021||World||US population growth in first pandemic year slowest since nation's founding||The population growth of the United States dipped to its lowest in the past year since the nation’s founding, according to figures released on Tuesday. the US Census Bureau said in its report the country’s population grew by only 0.1%, with an additional 392,665 added to the overall numbers. The estimate suggests that the nation’s population increased from 331,449,281 to 331,893,745, a gain of 0.13% since April 1, 2020, the Census Day.The Census Bureau said that the decline in growth rate can be attributed to decreased net international migration, decreased fertility, and increased mortality due in part to the Covid-19 pandemic.“Population growth has been slowing for years because of lower birth rates and decreasing net international migration, all while mortality rates are rising due to the ageing of the nation’s population,” said Kristie Wilder, a demographer in the Population Division at the Census Bureau, said in a statement.“Now, with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, this combination has resulted in a historically slow pace of growth,” she added.The US population growth between July 1, 2020, and July 1, 2021, was cumulative of a natural increase, which is the number of excess births over deaths, and net international migration, the difference between the number of people moving into the country and out of the country.The natural increase stood at 148,043 during the period while the increase due to net international migration stood at 244,622. This is the first time, the report noted, the net international migration has exceeded the natural increase for a given year.“Between 2020 and 2021, 33 states saw population increases and 17 states and the District of Columbia lost population, 11 of which had losses of over 10,000 people. This is a historically large number of states to lose population in year,” the Census Bureau said in a release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-population-growth-in-first-pandemic-year-slowest-since-nation-s-founding-101640106616028.html

Last week, it reported the fourth-highest number of cases in a single week so far."There is now consistent evidence that Omicron is spreading significantly faster than the Delta variant. And it is more likely that people who have been vaccinated or have recovered from Covid-19 could be infected or reinfected," he added.Referring to the holiday season, Tedros said that there can be no doubt that increased social mixing over the holiday period in many countries will lead to increased cases, overwhelmed health systems and more deaths."All of us are sick of this pandemic. All of us want to spend time with friends and family. All of us want to get back to normal. The fastest way to do that is for all of us - leaders and individuals - to make the difficult decisions that must be made to protect ourselves and others," he added.Emphasising that in some cases events may be cancelled or delayed, Tedros said, "But an event cancelled is better than a life cancelled."Stressing that it is better to cancel now and celebrate later than to celebrate now and grieve later, he said: "None of us wants to be here again in 12 months' time, talking about missed opportunities, continued inequity, or new variants."Tedros also urged countries to get 70 per cent of every country's population vaccinated."If we are to end the pandemic in the coming year, we must end inequity, by ensuring 70 per cent of the population of every country is vaccinated by the middle of next year," he added."Last week, WHO issued Emergency Use Listing for a ninth vaccine, produced by the Serum Institute of India under license from Novavax. This new vaccine is part of the Covax portfolio, and we hope that it will play an important role in achieving our global vaccination targets," the WHO chief added further.Underlining that even before the pandemic, one billion people were spending more than 10 per cent of their household budget on health care, he said that when people can not access the services they need, or can not afford them, individuals, families, communities and entire societies are put at risk."In the year ahead, WHO is committed to doing everything in our power to end the pandemic, and to beginning a new era in global health - an era in which health is at the centre of every country's development plans," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-3-3mm-lives-lost-due-to-covid-in-2021-must-end-pandemic-in-2022-who-chief-101640104831896.html

Days later, the two armies completed the disengagement process in Gogra, which was seen as a significant forward movement towards the restoration of peace and tranquillity in the region.Both sides have remained engaged at the level of foreign ministers and between the top military commanders besides through the WMCC (Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination) to keep the tensions under control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-claims-that-situation-in-india-china-border-generally-stable-101640105697194.html
21-12-2021||World||Statues of Hindu temples destroyed in Karachi||The statues of deities at a Hindu temple in this Pakistani city have been destroyed, the police said on Tuesday, the latest incident of vandalism against the places of worship of the minority community in this country.The incident took place at the Narayan Mandir in Karachi’s old city of Narainpura on Monday evening, they said.A man, identified as Muhammad Waleed Shabbir, has been arrested for damaging the statues of the deities, a senior police officer official, Sarfaraz Nawaz, said.“He was arrested on the complaint of a Hindu man, Mukesh Kumar, who with his wife was at the Narayan Mandir for prayers when they saw this man damaging the statues of Hindu deities with a hammer,” he said.An eyewitness said that angry Hindus, who were at the temple, caught hold of the miscreant and handed him over to the police.Later, the Hindu residents of the area staged a protest outside the police station, demanding the government to provide security to Hindus.They also raised slogans and protested that they were feeling insecure in the area after the incident.The area is mostly inhabited by poor and low-income Hindu families who have been living in Narainpura for decades.The police and Pakistani Rangers reached the spot and cordoned off the area.Sindh’s Minister for Minority Affairs Gyanchand Israni said that a case should be registered.He said that such incidents create unrest in the society.“We condemn such attacks,” he said.Another Hindu resident said that there were lots of Hindu families in the area and they had never seen such an incident and there had never been any incident of Hindu-Muslim tension in the area."We are labourers and very poor people. We do not harm anyone and always pray people will respect our worship places too," he said.The police official said that they were investigating the motive behind the incident.The videos of broken holy statues were seen circulating on social media.Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s Member of National Assembly Kheeal Das Kohistani condemned incident, saying that one out of two attackers has been held by the police.“No religion allows such kinds of acts,” he said.There have been incidents of Hindu temples being vandalised in other parts of the country as well.In October, a historical Hindu temple located at the bank of Indus River in Kotri city was desecrated by unidentified people.In August, the Ganesh temple in Punjab’s Rahim Yar Khan district was vandalised by a mob of over 200 people. In March, a group of unidentified people attacked an over 100-year-old Hindu temple in Rawalpindi.In December last year, century-old Shri Param Hans Ji Maharaj temple in Teri village in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak district was vandalised and demolished by a mob led by some local clerics. Last month, it was opened to devotees by Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed who had ordered authorities to reconstruct it.Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan. According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country.The majority of Pakistan’s Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, traditions and language with Muslim residents. They often complain of harassment by extremists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/statues-of-hindu-temples-destroyed-in-karachi-101640104162596.html

Trump told the crowd of supporters he would never concede the Nov. 3 election and urged them to "fight like hell" before they went to the Capitol, where lawmakers were preparing to certify Democrat Joe Biden's victory.Four people died on the day of the riot, and one Capitol police officer died the next day of injuries sustained while defending Congress. Hundreds of police were injured during the multi-hour onslaught by Trump supporters, and four officers have since taken their own lives.More than 700 people have been arrested in connection with the assault on the Capitol.The news conference will be at Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, he said in a statement that reprised his false claims about the presidential election won solidly by Biden.A congressional select committee is investigating the deadly attack, including Trump's actions and his efforts to change the results of the election.The committee had no comment on Trump's announcement, a spokesman said.A federal appeals court this month rejected Trump's request to withhold documents from the committee because of executive privilege, noting that Biden, as president, has already authorized their release.A spokesman for House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, did not immediately return a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-plans-news-conference-on-january-6-anniversary-of-deadly-us-capitol-riot-101640101422233.html
21-12-2021||World||Airbus, Boeing want US to delay new 5G services over flight safety concerns||The chief executive officers of the world’s two biggest plane makers have requested the Biden administration to delay the rollout of new 5G wireless services citing aviation safety concerns, according to news agencies. In a joint letter to US transport secretary Pete Buttigieg, Boeing and Airbus CEOs urged postponing the planned deployment of C-Band spectrum 5G wireless, saying "5G interference could adversely affect the ability of aircraft to safely operate." The duo warned that the deployment could have "an enormous negative impact on the aviation industry.""Airbus and Boeing have been working with other aviation industry stakeholders in the US to understand potential 5G interference with radio altimeters," AFP quoted Airbus spokesperson as saying. Radio altimeters are used to measure a plane's height above the ground.The reported letter comes amid concerns raised by the aviation industry and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) about the potential interference of 5G with sensitive aircraft electronics. Earlier this month, the FAA issued two directives to provide a framework and to gather more information to avoid “potential effects on aviation safety equipment.”The airworthiness directives, issued for all transport and commuter category aeroplanes and helicopters equipped with a radio altimeter, stated that radio altimeters cannot be relied upon to perform their intended function if they experience interference from wireless broadband operations in 5G C-Band.The FAA said it was working closely with the US government’s communications agency and wireless companies and has “made progress toward safely implementing the 5G expansion.”“We are confident with ongoing collaboration we will reach this shared goal,” it added.The US wireless industry group CTIA has said that any further delay in launching 5G in the C-Band would harm economic growth, insisting that there is not a “single report of 5G causing harmful interference with air traffic of any kind.” CTIA chief executive Meredith Attwell Baker said in a blog post last month that “there appears to be no valid scientific or engineering basis to justify a delay, and there is overwhelming evidence to support rapid deployment.”(with inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airbus-boeing-ceos-want-us-to-delay-new-5g-services-over-flight-safety-concerns-101640097548622.html
21-12-2021||World||China Bill to ban employers from asking about marital and pregnancy status||China would ban employers from stating gender preferences in job ads or asking female applicants about their marital and pregnancy status under a proposed overhaul of an almost three-decade-old women’s rights law.The nation’s top legislative body began reviewing a draft amendment to the Women’s Rights and Interests Protection Law on Monday, as part of a five-day meeting that wraps up Friday. The legislation was in its first reading before the National People’s Congress Standing Committee and could pass as soon as next year.  While gender discrimination is already broadly illegal in China, current laws are vague, contributing to poor enforcement. The revised draft would provide explicit descriptions and provide a more precise legal landscape on issues such as sexual harassment, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.Employers would be ordered to set up mechanisms to prevent, investigate and respond to such complaints, according to a China News Service report, although the legal ramifications for failing to do so were unclear.Despite China’s crackdown on the local #MeToo movement as a vehicle for spreading liberal Western values, an increasing number of women have spoken out publicly about their experiences of sexual assault in recent years, braving a patriarchal culture that often shames the victims. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. earlier this month fired a woman earlier who accused a manager of sexual assault in a high-profile case.Female job applicants have detailed on Chinese social media and in court a wide spectrum of workplace discrimination, including being forced to sign contracts pledging not to get pregnant as a condition of their hiring, according to a Human Rights Watch published in June. One-fifth of 2019 civil service job postings in China specified a preference for male applicants, the report found.  China’s decision in May to let couples have a third child, to combat a birth rate that’s reached its lowest level since at least 1978, has put extra pressure on female workers, HRW said.  “The current law on the protection of women’s rights and interests urgently needs to be further expanded and strengthened,” said He Yiting, an official from the NPC’s Social Development Affairs Committee, according to the official Legal Daily.Under the amendments, educational institutions wouldn’t be allowed to reject the applications of female students or lower requirements for male students to meet gender quotas. In rural areas, women should enjoy equal pay and land benefits, the bill says, adding that violators would could be prosecuted. However, the amendments include the caveat that exceptions can be made to comply with national guidelines in school or job applications.Lawmakers are also considering a change that would let women give birth by cesarean even if their husband does not give his permission, the Beijing News reported. Some hospitals require husbands or relatives to give their approval for the procedure.The revisions are expected to go through two more readings before being adopted next year. The Standing Committee is also reviewing other bills including a revision to China’s Company Law, which would formally write strengthening leadership of the Communist Party at state-owned companies into law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-proposes-bill-to-ban-employers-from-about-marital-and-pregnancy-status-101640093353175.html
21-12-2021||World||14 dead, 70,000 displaced in Malaysian floods||The Malaysian military used boats Tuesday to distribute food to desperate people trapped in their homes after massive floods, as the death toll rose to 14 with over 70,000 displaced.Days of torrential rain triggered some of the worst flooding in years across the country at the weekend, swamping cities and villages and cutting off major roads.Selangor the country's wealthiest and most densely populated state, encircling the capital Kuala Lumpur is one of the worst-hit areas.Some parts of the state capital Shah Alam were still underwater Tuesday, and military personnel in boats distributed food to people stuck in their homes and government shelters.Kartik Subramany fled his house as floodwaters rose, and took refuge in a school for 48 hours before being evacuated with his family to a shelter."My house is totally damaged, my two cars are wrecked," the 29-year-old told AFP."These are the worst floods of my entire life. The federal government has failed the people miserably -- it has failed in its primary function to protect and safeguard lives."He is among a growing number attacking what they say is a slow and inadequate official response.Thousands of emergency service and military personnel have been mobilised, but critics say it is not enough and volunteers have stepped in to provide food and boats for the rescue effort.An AFP journalist in one hard-hit Shah Alam neighbourhood saw people desperate for food snatching items from a devastating supermarket.Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob admitted Tuesday there were "weaknesses" in the response to the disaster and pledged there would be improvements in future."The responsibility is not that of the federal government alone, but also the state governments," he added, noting a month's rainfall had come down in a single day in Selangor.- 'Hopeless' official response -Opposition MP Fuziah Salleh described the official response as "hopeless" and "incompetent"."No early warning of the torrential rain was given," she told AFP. "It is so sad lives have been lost."Opposition politicians have accused the government of ignoring their calls to better prepare for the monsoon season, from November to February, particularly by improving drainage in densely populated urban areas.On Tuesday, the death toll from the floods rose to 14, including eight in Selangor and six in the eastern state of Pahang, official news agency Bernama reported.But with reports of people still missing, it is expected to increase.More than 71,000 people have been forced from their homes due to the floods, including 41,000 in Pahang and 27,000 in Selangor, according to official data.Evacuees are being housed in government relief centres but officials have warned to expect a rise in coronavirus cases linked to the crowded shelters.The rain has stopped and in many areas floodwaters have receded, leaving residents to count the cost."I've been doing business for more than 24 years... this has never happened before," said Mohammad Awal, whose cosmetic shop outside Kuala Lumpur was flooded.The Southeast Asian nation is hit by floods annually during the monsoon season, but those at the weekend were the worst since 2014 when over 100,000 people were forced from their homes.Global warming has been linked to worsening floods. Because a warmer atmosphere holds more water, climate change increases the risk and intensity of flooding from extreme rainfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/14-dead-70-000-displaced-in-malaysian-floods-101640090821988.html
21-12-2021||World||As Omicron surges, US Prez Joe Biden to expand testing and warn unvaccinated||The Biden administration will open federal Covid-19 testing sites in New York City this week and buy 500 million at-home rapid tests that Americans can order online for free starting in January as it tries to tackle the Omicron variant sweeping the country.Striking a more dire tone about the risks of remaining unvaccinated, President Joe Biden will lay out the initiatives on Tuesday in a speech that aims to persuade Americans to protect themselves from the fast-spreading variant, a senior administration official said.The measures include activating some 1,000 military medical personnel to support hospitals."We will also note that if you are unvaccinated, you are at high risk of getting sick. This variant is highly transmissible and the unvaccinated are eight times more likely to be hospitalized and 14 times more likely to die from Covid," the official said.With the holiday travel season already begun, new Covid-19 cases are surging in the United States, prompting local and federal officials to again confront just how far to go to combat the virus. Federal officials said that Omicron now accounts for 73% of all new cases, up from less than 1% at the beginning of the month.Health officials in Texas said on Monday the state recorded what ABC News reported is believed to be the first known US death related to Omicron.The highly contagious variant was first detected last month in southern Africa and Hong Kong, and has raced around the globe and been reported in 89 countries, the World Health Organization said on Saturday.Lines for Covid-19 tests wrapped around the block in New York, Washington and other US cities over the weekend as people clamored to find out if they were infected before celebrating the holidays with family.Facing criticism that testing resources are inadequate, Biden will announce on Tuesday that the federal government will buy 500 million at-home rapid tests and make them available to all Americans in January.Americans can access a new website to have them delivered, but officials are still working on how many tests a household can request.The administration will also open multiple federal testing centers starting in New York City ahead of Christmas, a senior administration official said.More federal sites will be opened across the country in areas of high need and when requested by local and state officials, the official said.Taking action now"Testing in this country is a lot better than it was, but there's more to do and we're taking action now," the official said.The free tests are in addition to a plan to have health insurers provide free tests for Americans with coverage that is also expected to begin in January.Biden will note that the Omicron variant is so contagious that it will infect vaccinated Americans but that they will be far less likely to get seriously sick.So-called breakthrough infections are rising among the 61% of the country's fully vaccinated population, including the 30% who have gotten booster shots.Still, Biden will tell Americans that those who are vaccinated and follow guidance around using masks, especially while traveling, should feel comfortable celebrating the holidays as planned.New Covid-19 cases rose 9% in the United States in the past week but are up 57% since the start of December, according to a Reuters tally.The number of hospitalised Covid-19 patients has increased 26% this month, with hospitals in some areas already strained by the Delta variant that emerged earlier this year.There have been almost 51 million infections and 809,268 coronavirus-related deaths reported in the country since the pandemic began, the most of any country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-omicron-surges-us-prez-joe-biden-to-expand-testing-and-warn-unvaccinated-101640088873125.html
21-12-2021||World||Dubai ruler must provide 554 million pounds to settle UK custody case||Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, has been ordered by the High Court in London to provide a British record of more than 554 million pounds ($733 million) to settle a custody battle with his ex-wife over their two children.The bulk of the massive award to Princess Haya bint al-Hussein, half-sister of Jordan's King Abdullah, and the couple's two children, is to ensure their lifetime security, not least to address the "grave risk" posed to them by the sheikh himself, the judge, Philip Moor, said.The judge said: "She is not asking for an award for herself other than for security" and to compensate her for the possessions she lost as a result of the marital breakdown.He directed Mohammed to make a one-off payment of 251.5 million pounds within three months to Haya for the upkeep of her British mansions, to cover the money she said she was owed for jewellery and racehorses, and for her future security costs.The sheikh, vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, was also told to provide 3 million pounds towards the education of Jalila, 14, and Zayed, 9, and 9.6 million pounds in arrears. He was also asked to pay 11.2 million pounds a year for the children's maintenance, and for their security when they become adults.These payments will be guaranteed via a 290 million pound security held by HSBC bank. The final sum, despite being believed by some London lawyers to be the largest public award ever ordered by an English family court, is less than half of the 1.4 billion pounds that Haya had originally sought.During almost seven hours of testimony, Haya, 47, said a large one-off payment would allow for a clean break and remove the sheikh's hold over her and their children."I really want to be free and I want them to be free," she told the court.The huge financial settlement is the latest development in a legal saga that began when the princess fled to Britain in April 2019, fearing for her safety after she began an affair with one of her bodyguards, and a month after she had asked the sheikh for a divorce.Later that year, the London court ruled Mohammed had carried out a campaign of threats and intimidation that made her fear for her life, and that he had also previously abducted and mistreated two of his daughters by another marriage.Earlier this year, the President of the Family Division in England and Wales, a senior judge, also determined that Mohammed had ordered the phones of Haya and her lawyers, one of whom is a parliamentary lawmaker, to be hacked using the sophisticated "Pegasus" state security software.Haya had not asked for any divorce settlement. She did not offer an explanation, but her lawyers said she would have been entitled to seek billions as the ex-wife of one of the world's richest men."The mother's financial claims, and the size of the relief that's being sought, are quite unprecedented," the sheikh's lawyer, Nigel Dyer, told the court during hearings which could not be reported until Tuesday.He said her demands were excessive and she was really claiming for herself under the guise of her children. He also accused the princess of misusing the children's funds, saying that she had paid out 6.7 million pounds to blackmailers, who were part of her security team, to keep an affair quiet.The court did not hear from the alleged blackmailers. Haya said she used money from the children's accounts because she was frightened.THE 70 MILLION POUND COURT FIGHTHaya's lawyer, Nicholas Cusworth, said legal fees over two and a half years had reached more than 70 million pounds, adding "the true extent of the colossal sums spent by (Mohammed) will never be known".The bulk of Haya's financial award will go on security, according to the details of the settlement. This was to keep the children safe from being abducted by their own father, the ruling said, including cash for a fleet of armoured cars which would be replaced every few years.Moor said Haya and her children needed the extensive provision to protect them from the sheikh, as well as because of their royal status."Absolutely uniquely, the main threat they face is from (the sheikh) himself not from outside sources," Moor said."There will remain a clear and ever present risk to (Haya) for the remainder of her life, whether it be from (Mohammed) or just from the normal terrorist," he said, referring to security threats faced by someone in Haya's position.Such were the concerns that Haya's head of security - known only as 'Director 1' - had to be brought into the courtroom to give evidence about her security needs with the windows blacked out, shielded with a curtain from all except Moor and two lawyers, and his name handed to the judge on a piece of paper.LIMITLESS MONEYHaya's lawyers told the judge the money available to the princess and the children in Dubai had been "limitless", with access to more than a dozen luxurious homes, a 400 million pound yacht and a fleet of private planes.She had an annual budget of more than 83 million pounds for her household in Dubai with another 9 million pounds spending money, the ruling said. Mohammed's lawyer acknowledged to the court he could raise 1.25 billion pounds in cash within three months."I remind myself that money was no object during the marriage," Moor said in approving Haya's claim for 1.9 million pounds to be spent on a kitchen extension, pizza oven and kitchen curtains at her London home.Moor said he would not give "carte blanche" to Haya's financial claims, but would consider her demands "with a very clear eye to the exceptional circumstances of this case, such as the truly opulent and unprecedented standard of living enjoyed by these parties in Dubai".Haya told the court it was not excessive for her to ask for millions to pay for five housekeepers, clothing, upkeep of her two mansions, one estimated to be worth about 100 million pounds, and regular holidays.Her jewellery, in total valued at some 20 million pounds, would fill the courtroom if spread out, she said.Moor ordered Mohammed to pay her 1 million pounds for missing haute couture garments which she said had disappeared and 5 million to cover nine weeks of vacations for her and family members every year."She is not, in the context of this case, wealthy," her lawyer, Cusworth, said. The ruling said she had been forced to sell 15.6 million pounds of assets - including horses worth 10 million and 2.1 million pounds worth of jewellery - to make ends meet while she waited for the final settlement.He said her demands should be seen in the context that Mohammed had a 2 million pound bill for buying strawberries one summer for his country estate, northeast of London.However, the sheikh's lawyer, Dyer, described many of Haya's claims as "absurd" or "ridiculous", and said they were totally at odds with her stated desire for her children to lead a normal life.He said the judge's ruling was likely to be "the largest financial remedy award certainly ever ordered and I imagine ever made by a family court".The previous largest sum ever thought to have been ordered by a British court was the 453.6 million pounds that Russian billionaire Farkad Akhmedov was instructed to pay for his 2016 divorce settlement.Mohammed, 72, had offered to pay regular maintenance sums of 10 million pounds a year, and provide a 500 million pound guarantee which Dyer said would "hang like a sword of Damocles" over his head and that of his family.In his conclusion, Moor said he found Haya's evidence to be "palpably honest".To Mohammed, the princess's lawyer Cusworth said, "the actual value of money is very different to any normal mortal involved in this case or any litigant who normally comes before this court".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubai-ruler-must-provide-554-million-pounds-to-settle-uk-custody-case-101640083172100.html
21-12-2021||World||US announces $5 mn reward for info on terrorist attack on blogger Avijit Roy||The US has offered a reward of up to USD 5 million for information on the heinous terrorist attack in Bangladesh in 2015 that left Bangladeshi-American atheist blogger Avijit Roy dead and his wife Rafida Bonya Ahmed seriously injured, the State Department has announced.Roy, a 42-year-old Bangladesh-born US citizen, was hacked to death by Islamist militants just after he left a book fair at the Dhaka University on February 26, 2015. His wife Rafida Ahmed was also injured in the attack.He was an outspoken critic of religious fundamentalism.“The US Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service, through its Rewards for Justice (RFJ) office, is offering a reward for information on the terrorist attack in Dhaka, Bangladesh that left US citizen Avijit Roy dead and his wife, Rafida Bonya Ahmed, seriously injured,” the US state Department said in a statement.Secretary of State Antony Blinken has authorised a reward of up to USD 5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction in any country of anyone involved in the murder of Roy and the attack on Ahmed, it said.On February 26, 2015, Roy and Ahmed, both Bangladesh-born US citizens, were visiting Dhaka to attend a book fair when they were attacked by assailants with machetes, it said, adding that while Roy was killed, Ahmed survived with critical injuries.“This investigation remains open, and we are seeking information that will assist law enforcement agencies in bringing to justice the perpetrators of this heinous terrorist attack.“A total of six individuals were charged, tried and convicted in Bangladesh. Two of the convicted conspirators, Syed Ziaul Haque (aka Major Zia) and Akram Hussain were tried in absentia and remain at large,” it said.Ansarullah Bangla Team, an al-Qaeda-inspired terrorist group based in Bangladesh, claimed responsibility for the attack. Shortly thereafter, Asim Umar, the now-deceased leader of al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), posted a widely circulated video claiming that AQIS followers were responsible for the attack on Roy and Ahmed, the state department said.In 2016, the Department of State designated AQIS as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist under Executive Order 13224, which provides authority to sanction terrorists and those who support terrorists or terrorist acts, it added.In 2015, the US had strongly condemned the "brutal murder" of Roy, terming the killing as an act of cowardice."The United States condemns in the strongest terms the brutal murder of Avijit Roy, which was horrific in its brutality and cowardice," State Department Spokesperson Jen Psaki had said."Avijit was a journalist, a humanist, a husband, and a friend, and we extend our condolences to his family and friends. He was taken from us in a shocking act of violence," she had said.In February, a special anti-terrorism tribunal sentenced five members of a banned Islamist militant group, including a fugitive army major, to death and a sixth man to life in prison for killing Roy in 2015.Bangladesh had witnessed an alarming rise of militant activities in 2015 when four "atheist" bloggers were murdered with authorities attributing the attacks to homegrown terrorists while Islamic State at that time had claimed responsibility for three attacks.An attack on the Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka in 2016 was the worst terrorist incident when 22 people, including 17 foreigners, were killed. A Bangladeshi court subsequently sentenced seven of the eight suspects to death.But it prompted the South Asian country with Muslim majority population to virtually declare a total war against Islamists engaging Army, paramilitary and elite police units that saw a series of countrywide raids on militant hideouts and deaths of dozens of extremists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-5-mn-reward-for-info-on-terrorist-attack-on-blogger-avijit-roy-101640083686594.html
21-12-2021||World||Former Israeli intelligence chief confirms country's role in Soleimani murder||Israel's former military intelligence chief says the country was involved in the American airstrike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in January 2020. It was the first public acknowledgement of Israel's role in the operation.Soleimani headed the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's elite Quds Force and helped orchestrate Iran's involvement with paramilitary groups abroad. He was killed in a US drone strike at the Baghdad airport in January 2020, an incident that threatened to pull the countries into full-blown conflict.A week after the airstrike, NBC News reported that Israeli intelligence helped confirm the details of Soleimani’s flight from Damascus to Baghdad. Earlier this year, a Yahoo News reported that Israel “had access to Soleimani’s numbers” and gave that intelligence to the United States.But Maj. Gen. Tamir Heyman, the now-retired general who headed military intelligence until October, appears to be the first official to confirm Israel's involvement.Heyman's comments were published in the November issue of a Hebrew-language magazine closely affiliated with Israel’s intelligence services. The interview was held in late September, a couple weeks before his retirement from the military. The authors wrote that Heyman opened the interview by talking about the American airstrike that killed Soleimani, but in which Israeli intelligence played a part.“Assassinating Soleimani was an an achievement, since our main enemy, in my eyes, are the Iranians," Heyman told the magazine. He said there were “two significant and important assassinations during my term” as head of army intelligence.“The first, as I’ve already recalled, is that of Qassem Soleimani -- it’s rare to locate someone so senior, who is the architect of the fighting force, the strategist and the operator -- it’s rare,” he said. Heyman called Soleimani “the engine of the train of Iranian entrenchment" in neighboring Syria.Israel has carried out hundreds of airstrikes in Syria in the past decade, but rarely publicly comments on them. Israel has said, however, that it has targeted bases of Iranian-backed force and arms shipments bound for Iran's proxy, the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah.Heyman said that Israeli strikes had succeeded in “preventing the attempt by Iran to put down roots in Syria.”The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Heyman's remarks.The interview was published as world powers and Iran were engaged in negotiations to reach a new agreement to curb Iran's nuclear program. The previous deal, struck in 2015, unraveled after the United States unilaterally withdrew in 2018 and re-imposed crippling economic sanctions on Iran.On Wednesday, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan was scheduled to meet this week in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett to discuss “a range of issues of strategic importance to the U.S.-Israel bilateral relationship, including the threat posed by Iran," National Security Council Spokesperson Emily Horne said.Israel considers Iran its regional arch-foe, and says it will take any steps needed to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-israeli-intelligence-chief-confirms-country-s-role-in-soleimani-murder-101640080475512.html
21-12-2021||World||Canada foreign minister tests positive for Covid as cases soar||Canada’s Foreign Minister tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday even as the country recorded over 10,000 fresh cases, potentially tied to the new fast-spreading Omicron variant.Foreign minister Melanie Joly announced on Twitter that she had taken a rapid test and tested positive. “Following public health guidelines, I am in isolation and will continue my work virtually, as I have been for a number of days, until I get the results of my PCR test,” she said, referring to the molecular test for the coronavirus that is considered far more accurate than the rapid antigen version.“I’m grateful for the protection that vaccines offer us and encourage everyone to get vaccinated and boosted. It’s the best thing we can do to keep our families safe this holiday season and all year long,” the 42-year-old added. Her announcement came as 10,621 new infections were reported in the country, and several jurisdictions tightened restrictions amid concerns over a winter wave driven by the Omicron variant.Ahead Christmas weekend approaches, Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam said “it’s clear the epidemic has accelerated quickly in many locations, leaving individuals & families to make tough decisions to keep everyone safer through the weeks ahead”.While she said these were “not the holidays we wished for”, she did add the country now had “more & better tools in the toolbox to clear this hurdle”.Among those is the large-scale rollout of Covid vaccine booster doses, with the country’s most populous province Ontario opening it up for everyone above the age of 18.Separately, the province of Quebec announced the closure of cinema theatres, bars, gyms, and schools on Monday, with 50% capacity limits imposed on restaurants and shortened hours of operation.The restrictions were imposed as Quebec recorded 4,571 fresh infections, its higher ever daily tally of new infections since the pandemic started. Quebec health minister Christian Dubé described the community spread as “astounding”.

The only cases reported so far have been in travelers who are in managed isolation and quarantine.“Public health advice suggests that soon every case coming into our border, into our managed isolation facilities, will be the omicron variant,” Hipkins said. “We already know that booster vaccinations significantly lift an individual’s immunity, reducing the spread and the severity of Covid-19.”Plans to allow travelers from Australia to self-isolate from Jan. 17, rather than go through managed isolation, have been pushed back to the end of February.Hipkins said with Australia’s New South Wales state “now expecting to record 25,000 cases a day by the end of January, opening the border in mid-January as planned simply presents too high a risk at this point.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-new-zealand-announces-measures-to-keep-omicron-variant-at-bay-101640070110980.html

However, only four Chinese companies submitted them, the report said.Among the four hopefuls are two of the firms blacklisted by the ADB, the Post reported citing a top official at the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal."These companies are blacklisted under the ADB's integrity guideline, and have been put on the sanctions list for ADB-funded projects," said the official of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal.According to the officials, the punitive actions will not be applied to ongoing projects the companies are currently undertaking.Notably, the companies have been blacklisted only for ADB-funded projects, a Nepali government procurement expert told the Kathmandu Post."But if the ADB informs Nepal's public procurement monitoring office about their misconduct and the manner in which they were put on the sanctions list, it will be easy for Nepal to blacklist them too. The integrity rules in the project are universal rules."This development comes as Nepal is planning to upgrade Kathmandu's airport which is currently functioning as the sole international airport. According to Post, heavy congestion and lower quality of services are observed during peak hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/adb-bars-3-chinese-construction-firms-from-nepal-s-key-airport-infra-project-101640068932371.html
21-12-2021||World||Japan hangs 3 prisoners on grounds of capital punishment,1st hangings since 2019||Japan hanged three prisoners on Tuesday, its first executions in two years, with the government saying it was necessary to maintain capital punishment in the face of continued "atrocious crimes".Japan is one of the few developed countries to keep the death penalty and public support for capital punishment remains high despite international criticism, especially from rights groups.More than 100 people are currently on death row, most of them for cases of mass murder. Executions are carried out by hanging, usually long after sentencing.One of the three executed on Tuesday was Yasutaka Fujishiro, 65, who used a hammer and knife to kill his 80-year-old aunt, two cousins and four others in 2004, a justice ministry spokeswoman told AFP.The other two were 54-year-old Tomoaki Takanezawa, who killed two clerks at an arcade game parlour in 2003, and his accomplice Mitsunori Onogawa, 44.The executions were the first under Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who took office in October."Whether to keep the death sentence or not is an important issue that concerns the foundation of Japan's criminal justice system," deputy chief cabinet secretary Seiji Kihara said."Given that atrocious crimes keep occurring one after another, it is necessary to execute those whose guilt is extremely grave, so it is inappropriate to abolish capital punishment."The country is reeling after a fire gutted a mental health clinic in the city of Osaka on Friday, with the death toll climbing to 25 as another woman succumbed to her injuries.Investigators have made the unusual move of naming the arson suspect although they have not yet announced a criminal investigation.- 53 years on death row -Japan executed three death-row inmates in 2019 and 15 in 2018 -- including 13 from the Aum Shinrikyo cult that carried out a fatal 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway.For decades, authorities have told death row inmates just hours before an execution is carried out.Two prisoners are suing the government over the system, which they argue is illegal and causes psychological distress.The pair are also seeking compensation of 22 million yen ($194,000) for the distress caused by living with uncertainty about their execution date.Documents and news archives show that Japan used to give death row inmates more notice, but stopped around 1975.In December 2020, Japan's top court overturned a ruling blocking the retrial of a man described as the world's longest-serving death row prisoner, raising new hope for the now 85-year-old.Iwao Hakamada has lived under a death sentence for more than half a century after being convicted in 1968 of robbing and murdering his boss, the man's wife, and their two teenaged children.But he and his supporters say he confessed to the crime only after an allegedly brutal police interrogation that included beatings, and that evidence in the case was planted.Worldwide, at least 483 people were executed last year in 18 countries, according to rights watchdog Amnesty International.That represents a drop of around a quarter from the year before, and fits a downward trend since 2015.The figure does not, however, include the "thousands" of executions believed to have been carried out in China, which keeps such data secret, along with North Korea and Vietnam.Japan and the United States are the only members of the G7 group of developed countries that still use the death penalty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-hangs-3-prisoners-on-grounds-of-capital-punishment-1st-hangings-since-2019-101640067246587.html

He mentioned about the “Pashtun culture” saying the ethnic group keeps women away from education as part of its culture.“I nearly lost my life fighting against Taliban’s ban on girls’ education. Thousands of Pashtoon activists and notables lost their lives when they raised their voices against Taliban’s horrors and millions became refugees. We represent Pashtoons - not the Taliban,” Yousafzai said on Twitter.I nearly lost my life fighting against Taliban’s ban on girls’ education. Thousands of Pashtoon activists and notables lost their lives when they raised their voices against Taliban’s horrors and millions became refugees. We represent Pashtoons — not the Taliban.Speaking at the Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) summit in Islamabad on Sunday, Imran Khan said that the Taliban – which now rules Afghanistan - was a predominant Pashtun movement. He also said that terror group Islamic State attacks Pakistan from Afghanistan.Khan's remarks sparked a response from former Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Afghans on social media.Karzai called Pakistan Prime Minister's remarks "an attempt to sow discord among Afghans, and an insult to the Afghan people." He also asked Imran Khan to stop interfering in Afghanistan's internal affairs.Afghanistan's former ambassadress to Norway Shukria Barakzai also said that the comments show his lack of knowledge of Afghanistan's history.A large number of social media activists posted photos and video clips of ancient Afghanistan where women would go to universities and schools and they were part of the cabinets in different governments.Some said that Kabul University has been founded in 1932 before the birth of Pakistan in 1947.Leader of Pashtoon Tahafuz Movement (PTM) Manzoor Pashteen in a Twitter post also condemned and said that Imran Khan's comments are false and negative.Pashteen said that Pashtoons never denied education to girls nor denied their rights.
