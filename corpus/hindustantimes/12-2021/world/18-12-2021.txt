Millions are without work and the banking system is only partially functional."If the political and economic situation doesn't change, there will be more migration," Stanikzai said.The United States has issued guidance that would permit personal cash remittances to Afghanistan but it has not relented on its refusal to release the $9 billion in central bank reserves or lift sanctions on a number of Taliban leaders.Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi met representatives from the International Committee of the Red Cross on Saturday in Islamabad, ahead of a meeting of foreign ministers from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to discuss the situation in Afghanistan.He said the Taliban welcomed international humanitarian organisations and gave assurances that they would be allowed to work unimpeded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-taliban-leaders-appeal-for-help-as-migrant-crisis-looms-101639844054493.html

The draft regulations of the lockdown are being drawn up which would ban indoor mixing except for work purposes, the reports said citing leaked minutes of a meeting of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage).The advisory group has reportedly presented UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson with a number of options under Plan C, ranging from "mild guidance to nudge people, right through to lockdown".With an exponential surge in Covid cases, the UK is witnessing around 700 to 800 hospital admissions every day for the last seven days and the Sage has warned that stringent measures would be required to prevent the number to reach the levels of January when the country was reporting over 3,700 hospital admissions a day."If the aim is to reduce the levels of infection in the population and prevent hospitalisations reaching these levels, more stringent measures would need to be implemented very soon," the Sage minutes said, as quoted by BBC.According to Sage minutes, the timing of more stringent measures is crucial and delaying it would greatly reduce the effectiveness of such interventions, reported BBC.The reports have emerged amid a worrying rise in confirmed cases of Omicron in Britain. On Saturday, the UK Health Security Agency said that almost 25,000 Omicron cases has been detected as of December 17, up by just over 10,000 cases from 24 hours earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/circuitbreaker-lockdown-on-cards-as-omicron-wreaks-havoc-in-uk-reports-101639838821202.html

It is spreading significantly faster than the Delta variant in countries with documented community transmission, with a doubling time between 1.5–3 days,” the WHO said in a media advisory.The UN health body also said it was uncertain about how much can the rapid transmission of Omicron could be because of escaping immunity against the disease.“Omicron is spreading rapidly in countries with high levels of population immunity and it remains uncertain to what extent the observed rapid growth rate can be attributed to immune evasion, intrinsic increased transmissibility or a combination of both,” it said.Also read | Omicron-driven third wave likely to arrive early next year, peak in Feb: Covid Supermodel panel“However, given current available data, it is likely that Omicron will outpace Delta where community transmission occurs,” it added.The WHO said there was only limited data regarding the clinical severity of the disease caused by the variant and more data was needed to understand the severity and how it was impacted by vaccination and existing immunity.However, the global health body also warned increasing cases could choke healthcare systems.“Hospitalizations in the UK and South Africa continue to rise, and given rapidly increasing case counts, it is possible that many healthcare systems may become quickly overwhelmed,” it said.Preliminary findings from England indicated a “significant reduction” in vaccine effectiveness against the symptomatic disease of Omicron as compared to the Delta variant following two vaccine doses of either the Pfizer BioNTech or the AstraZeneca vaccines, the WHO said.“There was, however, higher effectiveness two weeks after a Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty booster, which was slightly lower or comparable to that against Delta,” it also said.It warned that the preliminary findings need to be considered with caution as the “designs may be subject to selection bias and the results are based on relatively small numbers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-cases-doubling-in-1-5-to-3-days-in-areas-with-community-transmission-who-101639835437063.html

The reports suggest that the explosion occurred in a drain beneath a private bank near Paracha Chowk in Karachi's Shershah area.Station house officer Zafar Ali Shah said the bank had been served a notice to vacate the building so the drain could be cleaned up, adding that the accumulation of gases in the drain is suspected as the cause of the blast, reported Dawn. According to Geo TV, the police said the explosion occurred in a gas pipeline running through the drain.The footage of the blast shared on social media platforms shows a damaged building and debris lying at the site of the explosion.Police spokesperson Sohail Jokhio said it was not immediately clear what ignited the gas and a team of explosives experts was summoned to investigate, reported Associated Press.The spokesperson added that the powerful explosion shattered the windows of nearby buildings and badly damaged a parked vehicle.A second blast also took place during the rescue operation when a few electric wires collided with the gas line, according to Geo News, but no loss of life was reported in the second incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-10-killed-many-injured-in-blast-in-pakistan-s-karachi-report-101639823334656.html

There have also been 344 confirmed cases linked to the Omicron variant, reported in 11 Canadian provinces and territories, she added, warning that “these cases likely represent just the tip of the iceberg”.Tam warned that while health authorities were still investigating “the severity profile of this variant”, if Omicron were to replace Delta, “it’s expected the sheer number of cases could inundate the health system in a very short period of time”.The threat of a potential Omicron-driven winter wave comes as Covid deaths in Canada topped a grim milestone 30,000 this week. Provincial governments are increasing restrictions including on gatherings in churches, cinemas, and other venues. A drive to administer booster shots of Covid vaccines has been launched and opened to all those above 18 years of age.The government has formally advised Canadians against non-essential travel abroad, less than three months after it lifted Covid-related restrictions that were introduced in 2020.“We do not want you to be stranded or to be sick abroad,” said health minister Jean-Yves Duclos.Meanwhile, Tam added that “a growing number of cases across the country are not linked to travel”, which indicated that community transmission of Omicron was “established in many parts of Canada and outbreaks are being reported in a multiple settings”. The cases have been reported in both vaccinated and unvaccinated people in Canada, as well as in those previously infected, she said.

How does it happen? What can we do to decrease it,” said Alex Sigal, 51, who runs the lab that was the first to isolate the beta variant, the Covid-19 strain that’s been most successful in getting past inoculations. We “then figure out a way to quickly adjust our responses,” he said.South African labs have been critical to combating the coronavirus. They’ve identified two of the five so-called variants of concern and trained scientists from across the continent on how to gene sequence to spot and track variants. Sigal’s lab was the first to test omicron against blood plasma from people who’d received two doses of the shot produced by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. It also updated a paper that hypothesizes that variants may develop in immuno-suppressed people who’re unable to easily shake off the virus, allowing it to mutate.To many outside medical science circles, the role South Africa-based scientists have played in fighting the pandemic has come as a surprise. But with an HIV epidemic, the world’s biggest, nearing its fourth decade and hundreds of thousands of people infected with tuberculosis, South Africa has been a magnet for the scientists from around the world who track the pathogens that kill us.The country has set up a network of seven genomic surveillance labs with one at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and six at academic institutions.Sigal is Israeli-Canadian and a few floors below his lab in an eight-floor glass and face brick building is Krisp, a gene-sequencing laboratory whose Brazilian head, Tulio de Oliveira, announced omicron’s discovery to the world. “There’s a lot of technical capacity in South Africa to do genomic sequencing of pathogens because we’ve built up that expertise over many years for HIV and TB, ” said Richard Lessells, a Scottish infectious diseases specialist at Krisp. “Very early on in the pandemic, we recognized that genomic sequencing and genomic surveillance was going to be very important.”Scientists identify new drug that could treat COVID-19 pneumonia: LancetLocal TalentWith the onset of omicron that has meant sleepless nights for many of the scientists. “I’ve been working to get the Pfizer vaccine efficacy study ready,” said Sigal, who becomes animated when he watches a time-lapse video of the omicron variant attacking cells. “I worked through the night.” Sigal’s lab has made another important contribution to the country’s ability to monitor changes in the pandemic. When Covid hit, getting supplies across borders became tricky. The scientists quickly realized they couldn’t get cells in which to culture the virus, so they made their own line from human lung cells that had first been engineered by Sigal while completing his doctorate. This cell line, known as H1299-ACE2, is now being used widely in South Africa in various Covid-19 tests, including omicron.Omicron hit South Africa first and so far there’s much to be concerned about. The variant appears to be much more transmissible than earlier variants with daily cases hitting a record this week. Still, hospitalizations and deaths, so far, are substantially lower than in previous waves.While foreign scientists have flooded into South Africa to tackle the diseases that weigh on a country that straddles the first and third worlds, local talent is robust and developing rapidly.Sandile Cele, a 33-year-old from a small village near Durban, is part of Sigal’s team of seven scientists who culture cells, spin out plasma and wash test plates. In all, the Africa Health Research Institute, founded in 2016, has 550 students, staff and scientists.Nepal makes 2-week quarantine mandatory for travellers arriving from 67 nationsTB, HIVIt was quite challenging to suddenly switch from TB and HIV to coronaviruses, said Cele, who like most of the team is a graduate of the University of KwaZulu-Natal, about two miles from where he works.“But now with the emergence of new variants there is pressure,” Cele said. “For omicron especially we’re expected to give answers. Everyone has been looking in our direction.”While Sigal and his team are now focused on omicron, their aim is to help end the pandemic by getting ahead of a virus that rapidly mutates -- a task that won’t be easy.We need to start by “understanding how these variants evolve and in doing more surveillance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/inside-south-african-virology-labs-hunting-for-the-next-coronavirus-variant-101639820088109.html

The student was arrested in Salt Lake City.The police said that they were alerted about a student of the East High School carrying a gun. He was taken into custody as soon as he arrived in school.Later, when the backpack of the student was checked, officers found a gun and some bullets, the police said.The student was taken to the Salt Lake City detention centre where the case will be produced before a judge. The identity of the student has not been revealed because he is a minor.After the arrest of the student, the school administrators sent a letter to the parents of other students who alerted the police about the potential threat.Schools across the US are on alert after rumours of potential shootings on Friday spread on TikTok, though authorities said no credible threat had been found.Some schools - already on edge after a recent shooting - sent warnings to parents and stepped up security; a number of districts also cancelled classes for the day.TikTok said that it was working with law enforcement to investigate reported videos discussing an upcoming school shooting, but had "found nothing.""If we did find promotion of violence on our platform, we'd remove and report it to law enforcement," it added.TikTok, one of the most popular social media services with school-aged children, has already come under fire for allowing the posting of short videos challenging people to risky, damaging and illegal acts.Earlier this year the viral "Devious Licks" challenge video encouraged students to vandalize bathrooms at schools and make copycat TikTok videos of it.That led to numerous cases of minor destruction of school property around the country.According to Everytown for Gun Safety, an anti-gun violence nonprofit, at least 149 school shootings have occurred in the United States so far this year, with 32 deaths and 94 injuries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-school-shooting-threat-student-arrested-for-carrying-gun-in-backpack-101639813999834.html

18-12-2021||World||Scientists identify new drug that could treat COVID-19 pneumonia: Lancet||A newly identified drug may be used to effectively treat some patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia, according to a study published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal.The team, including researchers from the University of Birmingham and the University of Oxford, UK, tested namilumab -- an antibody already in late-stage trials to treat rheumatoid arthritis -- in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia.The patients were receiving 'usual' care, as well as having high levels in their blood of a marker of inflammation known as C reactive protein (CRP).CRP levels rise when there is inflammation in the body, and elevated levels of CRP have been found to be a potential early marker to predict risk for severity of COVID-19, the researchers said."Our research has provided important proof-of-concept evidence that namilumab reduces inflammation in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia," said Ben Fisher, co-chief investigator of the trial at the University of Birmingham and University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHB)."However, our sample size is too small for a definitive assessment of clinical outcomes and further studies are required for this, as well as to understand better the population that may benefit most,” Fisher said.Namilumab targets a ‘cytokine’ which is naturally secreted by immune cells in the body, but in uncontrolled levels is believed to be a key driver of the excessive and dangerous lung inflammation seen in COVID-19 patients.The trial carried out between June 2020 and February 2021 involved patients aged over 16 with COVID-19 pneumonia either being treated on a ward or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at nine hospitals across the UK.The study involved 54 patients receiving 'usual care' -- treatment with steroids and oxygen or ventilation -- and 57 patients given usual care as well as a single intravenous dose of 150mg of namilumab.As well as COVID-19 pneumonia, all study participants had CRP levels greater than 40mg/l.The researchers compared the probability of the reduction of levels of CRP in patients.Compared to usual care alone, the researchers found that there was a 97 per cent probability of CRP being reduced over time in those given namilumab when compared with usual care alone.The patients were monitored, and after 28 days the study also showed there were fewer deaths and more discharges from hospital or ICU in those who had been given namilumab compared to those receiving usual care alone.By day 28, 78 per cent of the patients receiving namilumab were discharged from hospital or ICU, compared to 61 per cent given usual care.In the namilumab group, 11 per cent were still in hospital by day 28, compared to 20 per cent in the usual care group, according to the researchers. Of those in the namilumab group, 11 per cent patients died compared to 19 per cent who died in the usual care group by day 28, they said.The team calculated the differences between the two groups in overall probability of those being discharged from ICU or a ward at 28 days. Of those on a ward, the probability of discharge at day 28 was 64 per cent in the usual care group, compared to 77 per cent in the namilumab cohort.Of those in ICU, probability of discharge at day 28 was 47 per cent in the usual care group, compared to 66 per cent in the namilumab cohort, according to the study.The researchers noted that the study results may not generalise to hospitalised patients without evidence of pneumonia or raised CRP or patients not requiring hospitalisation.It is important, therefore, that namilumab is now prioritised for further COVID-19 research in a much larger phase 3 clinical trial, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-identify-new-drug-that-could-treat-covid-19-pneumonia-lancet-101639806094436.html

They can't seek refuge anywhere else... everything was destroyed."After lashing Palawan island, Rai emerged over the South China Sea on Saturday and was headed towards Vietnam, the state weather forecaster said.Rai hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season -- most cyclones typically develop between July and October.Scientists have long warned that typhoons are becoming more powerful and strengthening more rapidly as the world becomes warmer because of human-driven climate change.The Philippines -- ranked as one of the world's most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change -- is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons every year, which typically wipe out harvests, homes, and infrastructure in already impoverished areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-rai-death-toll-in-the-philippines-rises-to-18-101639797214289.html

Other countries will transition to "endemic" with low, manageable caseloads during that same time period.By 2024, the disease should be endemic around the globe, the company projected."When and how exactly this happens will depend on the evolution of the disease, how effectively society deploys vaccines and treatments, and equitable distribution to places where vaccination rates are low," Dolsten said. "The emergence of new variants could also impact how the pandemic continues to play out."Pfizer developed its Covid-19 vaccine with Germany's BioNTech SE and currently expects it to generate revenue of $31 billion next year. It plans to make 4 billion shots next year.The drugmaker also has an experimental antiviral pill called Paxlovid which reduced hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk individuals by nearly 90% in a clinical trial. Three analysts estimate sales of $15 billion to $25 billion for it next year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Pfizer's forecast came after the emergence of the Omicron variant last month, which has more than 50 mutations compared with the original version of the virus. That has reduced the effectiveness of two doses of the vaccine against infection and spurred fear of rapid spread around the globe.Prior to the Omicron variant, top U.S. disease doctor Anthony Fauci forecast the pandemic would end in 2022 in the United States.Pediatric vaccineThe Pfizer vaccine is authorized in the United States for people age 5 and older. But it said on Friday that its study in children between the ages of 2 and 4 who were given two 3-microgram doses of the vaccine found it did not create the same immune response that a larger dose of the vaccine had in older children.The 3-microgram dose did generate a similar immune response in children aged 6 to 24 months, the company said.The company said it will now test a three-dose course in both age groups, as well as in older children. It had previously expected data from 2- to 4-year-olds this year but said it did not expect the delay would meaningfully change plans to file for emergency use authorization in the second quarter of 2022.Pfizer and BioNTech have also been developing a version of their vaccine tailored to combat the quick-spreading Omicron variant, although they have not decided whether it will be needed. They expect to start a clinical trial for the updated vaccine in January, Pfizer executives said.Variant-specific shots, if needed, could boost sales in 2022.The highly-transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus has been detected in over 77 countries and has spread to about one-third of U.S. states.The vaccine was around 95% effective in the adult clinical trial, but Pfizer has said that immunity wanes some months after the second dose. Early data suggests that three doses of the shot may be necessary to protect against the Omicron variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-amid-omicron-surge-pfizer-says-pandemic-could-extend-to-2024-101639788936218.html

It's possible, say experts||Amid the worry around the new Omicron variant of coronavirus, a new warning from some health experts has led to concerns across the world. The Omicron, since its discovery in South Africa last month, is on its way to become the dominant strain in the United States, replacing the delta variant.But can these two highly transmissible strains combine and create a super variant? It’s possible, according to Moderna’s Chief Medical Officer Dr Paul Burton.Appearing before the UK Parliament’s Science and Technology committee earlier this week, Dr Burton said that a new super variant could be created if Omicron and delta infect someone at the same time.“There's certainly data, there have been some papers published again from South Africa earlier from the pandemic when people - and certainly immunocompromised people - can harbour both viruses,” Dr Burton was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail.He said the high number of both delta and Omicron cases currently circulating in the United Kingdom has made this scenario more likely. On Friday, Britain reported 3,201 cases of the new variant, the biggest daily increase since Omicron was detected in the country, taking the total such cases to 14,909, according to official figures.Dr Burton told the parliamentarians that it was certainly possible that both the strains can swap genes and trigger a more dangerous variant. Researchers have warned that such “recombination events” are extremely rare but possible if conditions are right and there is a coincidence of mostly uncontrollable events.Peter White, a virologist at the University of New South Wales, too had warned about the possibility of a super strain emerging earlier this month in an interview to Bloomberg.Only three such recombination events have taken place so far. One such event was recorded by British health experts when the alpha variant merged with B.1.177, which first emerged in Spain, in late January.Scientists in California said in February that they identified another recombination variant when the Kent strain merged with B.1.429.However, such events have so far not led to any large outbreaks or a more dangerous version of the virus. But looking at the transmissibility of Omicron, and its mutations, the health experts are keeping a keen eye on what the future holds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-delta-and-omicron-combine-to-make-a-super-strain-it-s-possible-say-experts-101639787517424.html

Here's what a new study says||As the world grapples with ways to stop the Omicron variant of coronavirus from spreading, a new study has thrown light on how effective a booster dose can be. The study has been conducted by the researchers at the Imperial College London.Also Read | Vaccinating all to get priority over booster dose, says Indian govtThe study said that the booster shot can provide about 85 per cent protection against the fast-spreading variant.The study is based on the limited data that is available on Omicron, which emerged in South Africa last month and has spread to nearly 80 countries till now.The same model has suggested a higher effectiveness – about 97 per cent – against the delta variant of coronavirus.“Integrating immunological model within a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we show that booster doses will be critical to mitigate the impact of future Omicron waves in countries with high levels of circulating virus. They will also be needed in ‘zero-Covid’ countries where there is little prior infection-induced immunity in order to open up safely,” the researchers said in the study.Omicron has been spreading rapidly across the world. On Friday, Britain reported 3,201 cases of the new variant, the biggest daily increase since Omicron was detected in the country, taking the total such cases to 14,909, according to official figures.Also Read | Omicron is unstoppable nowThe data from UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) also said that the country recorded 93,045 coronavirus cases in the latest 24-hour period, breaking the daily record for the third consecutive day and bringing the total number of coronavirus cases in the country to 11,190,354.New York too reported a one-day record of more than 21,000 infections on Friday as the Omicron variant accelerates its spread across the US.In a bid to limit disruption, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention backed “test-to-stay” strategies that avoid sending unvaccinated kids home from school.

18-12-2021||World||US offers 18 million barrels of oil from its emergency reserves to cool prices||The US Department of Energy on Friday said it will sell 18 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, with offers from companies to purchase it due on Jan. 4, as part of a previously announced release aimed to cool fuel prices.The announcement of the sale was expected, after the Biden administration announced it as part of a wider 50 million barrel release from the reserve in coordination with other oil-consuming countries including China, India and South Korea. The Energy Department said last Friday the sale would be posted on Dec. 17.The administration has been trying to deal with the concerns of US consumers about high fuel costs and inflation as they travel more, even though President Joe Biden has few tools to deal with the price of crude, which is traded in a global market.In conducting the sale, the Energy Department is speeding up an auction that had been authorized by Congress in 2018 to fund the government.Deliveries of oil to companies from the SPR, a series of caverns on the Texas and Louisiana coasts, will be from Feb. 1 to March 31, the department said.The department also plans to loan up to 32 million barrels of oil from the SPR to companies required to return the crude with interest. The first batch of that exchange will be 4.8 million barrels with Exxon Mobil Corp, the largest U.S. oil company, the department said last Friday.Brent crude prices settled down 2% on Friday to $73.52 a barrel as surging cases of the Omicron variant raised fears that new restrictions could hit fuel demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-offers-18-million-barrels-of-oil-from-its-emergency-reserves-to-cool-prices-101639781199685.html
18-12-2021||World||Ahead of key polls, Malaysian opposition struggles to garner support||Voters in Malaysia’s biggest state are set to reject the opposition alliance in elections on Saturday, increasing pressure on Anwar Ibrahim to step aside as de facto leader and forcing a rethink in strategy ahead of a national vote that may be called as soon as next year.The polls in Sarawak in Borneo island is expected to present another major defeat for Anwar’s Pakatan Harapan. That’s a given because the local parties that have controlled the state since independence are aligned with the ruling United Malays National Organization.The opposition has already been thrashed last month in a state election in peninsular Malaysia thanks to an UMNO campaign led by disgraced former premier Najib Razak who focused on reviving a pandemic-battered economy. Najib criticized the opposition for harping on his corruption trials linked to troubled state fund 1MDB, although an appeals court upheld a guilty verdict soon after the polls. UMNO won’t contest in the Sarawak polls, preferring to back local parties in the resource-rich state. Their certain victory will help it consolidate its power after the pro-Malay party returned to the top seat of government four months ago and could bring forward the next general election that must be held by 2023.Blaming Anwar’s leadership alone for Pakatan Harapan’s inability to make any headway in Sarawak would be “hoping for a quick fix, but little would change,” said Wong Chin Huat, a professor of political science at the Jeffrey Sachs Center on Sustainable Development at Sunway University in Malaysia.Pakatan Harapan needs to transform into a policy-based coalition instead of a mere election-based alliance and form a shadow cabinet if it wants to compete, Wong said. “With a shadow cabinet, Anwar’s potential heirs will naturally emerge. Without that, a new captain without a functioning team will not keep any excitement for long.”Anwar’s own fortunes are also seeing a slide along with that of the opposition coalition.There have been calls for him to resign and make way for younger leaders after the dismal showing at the Malacca state election that saw his own party completely wiped out. Anwar has acknowledged the calls within the opposition coalition to step down but has brushed aside the need to do so immediately.Anwar’s Parti Keadilan Rakyat still backs him as the opposition leader, although internal party elections that must be held by May 2023 could see some changes. “We don’t see a change at the very top. Keadilan will have party elections soon that will see a clearer, younger line-up post Anwar, but Anwar will still be leading the campaign for GE15,” said Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad, a PKR lawmaker, referring to the next general election.Anwar has struggled for decades to take power in Malaysia. He was seen as Mahathir Mohamad’s successor in the 1990s before he was fired and spent six years in jail for abuse of power and sodomy. He went back to jail again in 2015 on a subsequent sodomy charge during Najib’s time as prime minister. It was only after Anwar’s party joined forces with other opposition groups and his old foe Mahathir to unseat UMNO in a shock election win that he was released, thanks to a royal pardon. But his turn at the top job still eluded him.Mahathir, who was supposed to make way for Anwar to become prime minister, kept pushing back the handover date that eventually led to the unraveling of the government.Rural SarawakAnwar and Mahathir mainly tapped voter disillusionment with UMNO in the 2018 elections to win big, focusing on Najib’s troubles with debt-laden state fund 1MDB. This holds little traction in rural Sarawak then and now, as pledges on building roads and raising incomes are the main issues. “It is very, very difficult to dislodge the government there,” said James Chin, a professor at the University of Tasmania. That’s mainly because much of Sarawak is made up of small villages patronized by government-aligned chiefs who dictate which parties the voters should support, he said.Elections in Sarawak are often an opportunity for voters to get cash and food handouts from the ruling parties in exchange for their support at the ballot box, which is illegal by a law that is rarely enforced. Some 1.25 million voters in Sarawak will elect 82 lawmakers to the state assembly in the polls that were delayed due to a five-month Covid-induced emergency that lifted in November. While the opposition has been unable to agree on who should lead their campaign for the Sarawak elections, there has been consensus on seat allocations and they have been campaigning separately under a looser platform. Some in Pakatan Harapan see that as a good road map for the next national elections, a reversal from the coalition’s earlier strategy to contest under Anwar’s party logo in the 2018 polls.“Component parties should highlight their own manifestos and use their own logos,” said Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad. The opposition is going into Sarawak as “very much the underdogs,” he added, a scenario similar to the future national polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ahead-of-key-polls-malaysian-opposition-struggles-to-garner-support-101639781177480.html
18-12-2021||World||Epstein sex abuse trial: Ghislaine Maxwell declines to testify||Ghislaine Maxwell's defense rested its case in her sex abuse trial on Friday after the British socialite told the judge prosecutors had not proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt.In two days of testimony from former employees of Jeffrey Epstein, a psychologist specializing in memory, and an ex-girlfriend of the late financier, the defense sought to undercut the testimony of four women who said Maxwell set them up for sexual abuse by Epstein when they were teenagers.Ghislaine Maxwell's defense rested its case in her sex abuse trial on Friday after the British socialite told the judge prosecutors had not proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt.In two days of testimony from former employees of Jeffrey Epstein, a psychologist specializing in memory, and an ex-girlfriend of the late financier, the defense sought to undercut the testimony of four women who said Maxwell set them up for sexual abuse by Epstein when they were teenagers.|#+|Maxwell, 59, pleaded not guilty to eight counts of sex trafficking and other crimes. Her attorneys argued she is being scapegoated for Epstein's conduct. Epstein killed himself in 2019 at the age of 66 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex crimes charges.Maxwell told US District Judge Alison Nathan that she would not testify in her own defense on Friday."Your honor, the government has not proven the case beyond a reasonable doubt and so there is no need for me to testify," said Maxwell, standing up in the courtroom.Maxwell's attorney Bobbi Sternheim wrapped her arm around her back as she spoke. Defendants in US criminal trials are not required to testify, and often do not, since the burden of proof is on prosecutors.Closing arguments in the trial are expected on Monday in federal court in Manhattan. The jury would then begin deliberations.Nathan advised jurors to "be cautious out there" before sending them home for the weekend. COVID-19 cases are on the rise in New York, and Nathan earlier on Friday said she wanted to avoid "unnecessary delays" to the trial."I want to see everybody back here Monday," Nathan said.During the trial, Maxwell's defense sought to portray her four accusers as not credible, arguing their memories had been corrupted since the events were said to have happened between 1994 and 2004 and that they were motivated by the prospect of a payout from a compensation fund for Epstein's victims.On Friday afternoon, Maxwell attorney Christian Everdell read a stipulation agreed upon by both sides indicating that an attorney for one of the women, known by the pseudonym Jane, had told her that cooperating with prosecutors could "help her case," without providing details.The lawyer, Robert Glassman, also told her that cooperating was the "morally right thing to do," the stipulation said.Jane testified during the trial's first week that she was awarded $5 million from the fund but did not think participating in Maxwell's criminal case would help her claim.Jurors earlier on Friday heard from an FBI agent who interviewed Jane multiple times before Maxwell's July 2020 arrest. The agent acknowledged that Jane had not initially told them she was ever in a room alone with Epstein and Maxwell. Jane testified that Maxwell sometimes participated in sex acts with her and Epstein.Jane, who said she was 14 when Epstein began abusing her in 1994, testified that "memory is not linear." She also said she was not comfortable enough during her first few meetings with the FBI to share everything that happened to her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/epstein-sex-abuse-trial-ghislaine-maxwell-declines-to-testify-101639780693887.html
18-12-2021||World||Google, Meta win US security agency support for undersea fiber optic cable||US security officials recommended approval for Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook Inc. parent Meta Platforms Inc. to build an undersea fiber optic cable linking the US to Taiwan and the Philippines.The companies agreed to restrict access to equipment and information for Hong Kong-based partner Pacific Light Data Communication Co., which earlier withdrew its application for a link to Hong Kong, the Justice Department said in a news release Friday.“These agreements enable Google and Meta to take advantage of critical, additional cable capacity while protecting US persons’ privacy and security through terms that reflect the current threat environment,” said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department’s National Security Division.The companies proposed the Pacific Light Cable Network project in 2017, listing all three trans-Pacific destinations. American security agencies in 2020 asked the FCC to deny the link to Hong Kong, saying it would give China a way to acquire Americans’ personal data. The agencies called Pacific Light Data a subsidiary of mainland China’s Dr. Peng Telecom & Media Group Co.The data-sharing restrictions announced Friday reflect the Chinese government’s “sustained efforts to acquire the sensitive personal data of millions of U.S. persons,” the Justice Department said in its statement. It also cited the Chinese government’s access to other countries’ data through digital infrastructure investments, and recent intelligence and cybersecurity laws.The security agencies on Friday recommended that the Federal Communications Commission approve the cable, which now lacks a Hong Kong link.The companies’ agreements were made with the departments of Justice, Defense and Homeland Security in their roles as members of the committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the U.S. Telecommunications and Services Sector, known informally as Team Telecom.“We are encouraged by the administration’s recommendation,” a Meta spokesperson said in an email. “This cable system increases internet capacity between the two countries to help people stay connected and share content, like photos and videos” via cables that feature advanced encryption.Google didn’t immediately respond to an emailed query, nor did the FCC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-meta-win-us-security-agency-support-for-undersea-fiber-optic-cable-101639780467037.html
18-12-2021||World||US on alert for violence after rumors of school shooting spread on TikTok||The United States was on heightened alert for school violence Friday after rumors of potential shootings spread on TikTok, though authorities said no credible threat had been found.Some schools -- already on edge after a recent shooting -- sent warnings to parents and stepped up security, with a number of districts also canceling classes for the day."The White House and federal law enforcement are closely monitoring threats of violence in schools circulating on social media," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Twitter.TikTok said that it was working with law enforcement to investigate reported videos discussing an upcoming school shooting, but had "found nothing.""Local authorities, the FBI, and DHS (Department of Homeland Security) have confirmed there's no credible threat," the company said, "so we're working to remove alarmist warnings that violate our misinformation policy.""If we did find promotion of violence on our platform, we'd remove and report it to law enforcement," it added.The FBI said it was examining supposed threats, and the DHS said in a tweet that it did "not have any information indicating any specific, credible threats to schools."Recent school shootingsComing less than three weeks after the latest mass shooting in a US high school -- which left four students dead in Oxford, Michigan -- school administrators were quick to respond to the rumors."There is information circulating that today may be a day of attacks on schools. Administration and DC Police are very aware of this and on close watch," a message sent to parents by a school in Washington said Friday morning.The Pennsbury School District in Pennsylvania told parents that there would be an increased police presence even though they "do not believe the threat to be credible."Psaki said that "today is another reminder of how many kids and parents live in fear of school shootings or violence. It is unacceptable."TikTok, one of the most popular social media services with school-aged children, has already come under fire for allowing the posting of short videos challenging people to risky, damaging and illegal acts.Earlier this year the viral "Devious Licks" challenge video encouraged students to vandalize bathrooms at schools and make copycat TikTok videos of it.That led to numerous cases of minor destruction of school property around the country.At the time TikTok said it was taking action to remove videos and minimize their spread "to discourage such behavior."According to Everytown for Gun Safety, an anti-gun violence nonprofit, at least 149 school shootings have occurred in the United States so far this year, with 32 deaths and 94 injuries.Sandy Hook Promise, a group formed in response to the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, condemned the alleged threat."Gun violence is not a subject for jokes or pranks. All threats need to be taken seriously," they said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-on-alert-for-violence-after-rumors-of-school-shooting-spread-on-tiktok-101639780162603.html
