The nation has witnessed several debates about vaccines and inoculation mandates, with a section of people questioning the need for vaccines altogether.The report pointed out that the demand for vaccines grew from an average of under-a-million doses a day to an average of 1.5 million a day in recent weeks, citing data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The report also highlighted that many among those queuing across vaccination centres are there for their first dose.“What the public needs to keep in mind is that we’ve got a stressed and strained healthcare delivery system,” Mitchel Rothholz, the head of immunisation policy at the American Pharmacists Association told the NYT.The Biden administration is planning to create hundreds of family-vaccination clinics, one-stop shops for first shots and boosters. The CDC also recommended booster shots in order to ensure that people in the US remain protected against Omicron and Delta variants.The US pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci on Sunday said that early indications regarding the severity of the Omicron Covid-19 are ‘encouraging’. “Omicron has a transmission advantage. Though it's too early to really make any definitive statements about it, thus far, it does not look like there's a great degree of severity to it. Thus far, the signals are a bit encouraging,” Fauci said while speaking to CNN.However, Moderna’s president Stephen Hoge told news agencies that there was concern regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine. “I think that there's a real risk that we're going to see a decrease in effectiveness of the vaccines. What I don't know is how substantial that is,” Hoge said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sees-long-queues-in-vaccination-centres-following-omicron-scare-report-101638724820140.html

05-12-2021||World||Indonesia volcanic eruption: Smoldering debris from Semeru hinders rescue ops||Rescuers were searching for survivors Sunday on the slopes of the highest volcano on Indonesia’s island of Java after it was rocked by an eruption that killed at least 13 people, as smoldering debris and thick mud hampered their efforts.Mount Semeru in Lumajang district in East Java province spewed thick columns of ash more than 12,000 meters (40,000 feet) into the sky, and searing gas and lava flowed down its slopes after a sudden eruption Saturday triggered by heavy rains. Villages and nearby towns were blanketed with falling ash and several hamlets were buried under tons of mud from volcanic debris.Authorities warned the thousands of people who fled the volcano’s wrath not to return during Sunday’s lull in volcanic activity, but some villagers were desperate to check on livestock and possessions left behind. In several areas, everything — from the thinnest tree branch to couches and chairs inside homes — was caked with ash.The debris and lava mixed with rainfall to form thick mud that destroyed the main bridge connecting Lumajang and the neighboring district of Malang, as well as a smaller bridge, said Thoriqul Haq, the district chief in Lumajang.The eruption eased pressure that had been building under a lave dome perched on the crater. But experts warned that the dome could still further collapse, causing an avalanche of the blistering gas and debris trapped beneath it.A thunderstorm and days of rain, which eroded and partly collapsed the dome atop the 3,676-meter (12,060-foot) Semeru, triggered the eruption, said Eko Budi Lelono, who heads the geological survey center.He said flows of searing gas and lava traveled up to 800 meters (2,624 feet) to a nearby river at least twice on Saturday. People were advised to stay 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) from the crater’s mouth, the agency said.Television reports showed people screaming and running under a huge ash cloud, their faces wet from rain mixed with volcanic dust.Despite an increase in activity since Wednesday, Semeru’s alert status had remained at the third highest of four levels since it began erupting last year, and Indonesia’s Volcanology Center for Geological Hazard Mitigation did not raise it this week, Lelono said.Semeru, the stratovolcano, is also known as Mahameru, meaning “The Great Mountain” in Sanskrit. It has erupted many times over the last 200 years. Still, as with other volcanoes — it is one of 129 under watch in Indonesia, the world’s largest archipelago — more than 62,000 people call Sumeru's fertile slopes home. The 3,676-meter (12,060-foot) volcano last erupted in January, with no casualties.Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 270 million people, is prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity because it sits along the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” a horseshoe-shaped series of fault lines. Currently 54% of the country’s nearly 270 million people live on Java, the country’s most densely populated area.Officials said earlier they had hoped they could avoid casualties by closely monitoring the volcano, but the death toll quickly rose from one late Saturday to 13 on Sunday morning.National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said 57 people had been hospitalized, mostly with burns, respiratory problems and other injuries. He said rescuers were still searching for seven residents of Curah Kobokan village who were reported missing.More than 900 villagers streamed into makeshift emergency shelters after Saturday’s powerful eruption, but many others defied official warnings and chose to remain in their homes, saying they had to tend to their livestock and protect their property, said Haryadi Purnomo of East Java’s search and rescue agency.“We’ll do everything we can to evacuate them by preparing trucks and motorbikes for them to flee at any time,” Purnomo said.He said his teams were searching for survivors and victims on the southern slope of the mountain, but thick mud, smoldering debris and heavy rain have hampered the search. He described several formerly lush villages south of the crater as “death zones.”“There’s no life there... trees, farms, houses are scorched, everything is covered in heavy gray ash,” Purnomo said, adding that several other areas were virtually untouched. Search and rescue efforts were temporary suspended on Sunday afternoon amid fears that smoldering debris and hot ash could tumble down from the crater due to heavy rains.Indonesian President Joko Widodo said Sunday that he instructed his Cabinet ministers and disaster and military officials to coordinate the response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-volcanic-eruption-smoldering-debris-from-semeru-hinders-rescue-ops-101638695830931.html

05-12-2021||World||Didi departure from NYSE marks end of Wall Street romance with Chinese big tech||The Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing's announcement that it will delist its shares from the New York Stock Exchange marks the end of a cushy relationship between Wall Street and Chinese tech giants, who are under siege from authorities in Beijing and regulators in America.Only five months transpired between Didi's going public in New York in June and word Friday that it will prepare a Hong Kong listing. During that time its market value has fallen by 63 percent.Didi's move comes in the wake of a sweeping Chinese regulatory crackdown in the past year that has clipped the wings of major internet firms wielding huge influence on consumers' lives -- including Alibaba and Tencent.After Friday's announcement, heavyweight Chinese online retailers whose stocks are sold on the New York exchange, such as Alibaba, JD.com and Pinduoduo, dropped sharply.Shares in Alibaba -- whose arrival on Wall Street in 2014 to a loud fanfare kicked off the parade of Chinese firms listing in the Big Apple -- fell to their lowest level in nearly five years as rumors circulated that, after Didi leaves, Alibaba might be next.Technically, even as Didi Chuxing moves its listing to Hong Kong, holders of its shares in New York retain those stakes. Their investment does not simply vanish.But "people are very fearful about regulations and the Chinese government," said Kevin Carter, portfolio manager at EMQQ. "And that has really, really affected sentiment. People are scared."Coincidentally, on Thursday US market regulators announced the adoption of a rule allowing them to delist foreign companies if they fail to provide information to auditors.The move is aimed primarily at Chinese firms, and requires them to disclose whether they are "owned or controlled" by a government."While more than 50 jurisdictions have worked... to allow the required inspections, two historically have not: China and Hong Kong," Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler said.'Sensitive data'The Global Times, a newspaper close to the Chinese Communist Party, criticized the new US regulation in an opinion piece Friday."If the US sets unequal conditions on national security for competition between the two countries by demanding Chinese listed companies hand over audits for inspection so as to spy on China's internal situation and store huge amounts of sensitive data acquired by Chinese companies, China won't accept that," the unsigned piece said.Many of these New York-listed shares are held not by private citizens but rather by institutional investors."Some funds can only have shares that are traded on US markets," said Gregori Volokhine, president of Meeschaert Financial Services. "This is what is putting pressure on shares."And for many market watchers, Didi, described as China's answer to Uber, will not be the last Chinese tech giant to delist from New York."It is not specific to Didi because for months we have seen the communist party's grip on companies tighten," said Volokhine.Shortly after Didi went public in New York, the reservation platform Full Truck Alliance and the job-search site Kanzhun were investigated by China's cybersecurity watchdog.The Chinese government has also tightened regulations on companies that offer families private tutoring. This has hurt companies listed in New York.According to figures in May from a US government agency, a total of 248 Chinese companies are listed in the United States, with a combined market capitalization of 2.1 trillion dollars."After an active start to the year, Chinese companies have largely stopped tapping the US IPO market since June, due to regulatory and policy roadblocks in both countries," said Matthew Kennedy, a strategist with Renaissance Capital.This week Spark Education, a big Chinese online small-class teaching firm, withdrew its planned IPO in the US."The way things are, one can say there will be no more new Chinese IPOs and the ones in the pipeline will be withdrawn one by one," Volokhine said. Renaissance Capital says there are 35 companies in that pipeline.In leaving the US market, Chinese companies are giving up an investor base like no other in the world -- with $52.5 trillion in assets under management, compared to $7.1 trillion in China, according to a study last year by McKinsey and Company, a management consulting firm.Carter said this political pressure on Chinese companies creates an odd situation in which the stars of the Chinese tech world are plummeting on the stock market, but not because of their earnings reports."And these companies are still making profits. And then those profits are still growing," he said."The revenue growth for the year is over 30 percent. Not for every company, but a bit collectively. No matter where the stock is, no matter where the stocks trade, that's still the case," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/didi-departure-from-nyse-marks-end-of-wall-street-romance-with-chinese-big-tech-101638694551677.html

The doctors say it is necessary for the process to start immediately to "prevent the collapse of the healthcare system," the RDA said in a statement earlier."We request all stakeholders and administrative authorities to ensure that the process of induction of new doctors is completed at the earliest," it added.There have been repeated delays in conducting NEET-PG 2021 counselling despite multiple reminders and communications with the ministry and authorities concerned, the RDA of Safdarjung hospital said. "As the third wave of Covid is imminent, we wish to reiterate that we are grossly understaffed as the PG residents of the 2021 batch have not yet joined," it added.Resident doctors are exhausted and on the verge of a breakdown but have been patiently waiting and working with resilience for patients’ care, the association also said.Resident doctors at a few Delhi government-run facilities like the LNJP Hospital and the DDU Hospital have also refused to offer services in OPDs over the same issues.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/neetpg-counselling-delay-rml-resident-doctors-to-boycott-emergency-services-from-monday-101638696034889.html
05-12-2021||World||Incomplete Saddam-era marquee mosque lays bare Iraq divisions||It was meant to compete with the Taj Mahal in grandeur, but former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's monumental Al-Rahman Mosque project was never completed.Instead, the half-finished edifice of grey concrete stands in the heart of Baghdad as testimony to the sectarian and political strife that has shaped much of Iraq's modern history.The aim was for the mosque, with a capacity for 15,000 worshippers, to be one of the largest in the Middle East.Launched in the 1990s in the midst of a crippling Western embargo over Saddam's invasion of Kuwait, the construction of the mosque was designed to be a snub to Washington.But the dictator's dreams of grandeur -- along with them his iron-fisted rule -- would come crumbling down with the 2003 US-led invasion.Today, a vast hole gapes at the sky from where an 84-metre-tall (280-foot), gold-adorned ceramic dome was supposed to cover the central prayer hall.Around it, eight secondary domes 28 metres high, each flanked by eight smaller domes, stand in a suspended state of near completion.Several cranes are frozen in time above the edifice, which towers over the upscale Mansur district of the capital."Unfortunately, we've neglected the country's heritage," architect and university professor Mohamed Qassem Abdel Ghaffour told AFP."These projects belong to all Iraqis, we should make use of this heritage, and turn them into cultural and touristic sites," he added."All of this is Iraq's money and the state must profit from it."Although it was initially built as a Sunni mosque, it was taken over by Shiite clerics after the fall of Saddam.Today, it is a symbol of division between Shiites, now the dominant political force in Baghdad after decades of marginalisation in the Shiite-majority Arab state."After the fall of the old regime, the mosque fell under the control of the Islamic Virtue Party," a senior government official who asked to remain anonymous told AFP."The party was never able to complete construction, because the costs are huge."Weapons of the partiesSaddam Hussein "wanted a mosque bigger than the Taj Mahal", he recalled.The Islamic Virtue Party has blocked government plans to turn the mosque into a university or museum, the official said.Although the party's takeover of the mosque remains unofficial, its members hold the main weekly prayers each Friday at noon under one of the secondary domes.About 150 families have lived for years in makeshift homes that sprouted on vacant lots surrounding the mosque.In January 2020, a court recognised the authority of the Shiite waqf -- the institution that manages the community's religious properties -- over the mosque.The verdict obliged the Islamic Virtue Party to pay $200 million in compensation, according to a statement from the waqf.The waqf accuses the party of having occupied the site "for more than 16 years", "without any legal or religious legitimacy".But the court ruling has not been enforced.Activist Subeih al-Kachtini said that Iraqi security forces had tried several times to intervene."But faced with the weapons of the state, there are the weapons of the parties," he said.'Architectural symbolism'Development of land adjacent to the mosque to build a shopping centre or a housing complex could create up to 20,000 jobs, according to the waqf.But "construction cannot resume until the mosque is removed from partisan conflicts", Kachtini said, and the status quo remains.For Caecilia Pieri, a researcher at the French Institute of the Near East, the mosque testifies to the "policy of architectural symbolism" of Saddam's Baathist regime.The late dictator's approach could be summed up as: "I write Allah Akbar (God is Greatest) on the national flag and build mosques," said Pieri, a specialist in the architecture of Baghdad in the 20th century.Mazen al-Alussi, who headed the department in charge of conception and planning under Saddam, said the project was a "one of a kind" initiative.The cost to complete the mosque need not be exorbitant, said Alussi. "It should be turned into a unified mosque where both Shiites and Sunnis can pray."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/incomplete-saddam-era-marquee-mosque-lays-bare-iraq-divisions-101638694640684.html
05-12-2021||World||'Metaverse' hype fuels booming digital property market||The idea of spending millions on non-existent land may sound ludicrous -- but feverish predictions of a virtual reality future are pushing investors to bet big on digital real estate.This week, New York-based company Republic Realm announced it had spent a record-breaking $4.3 million on digital land through The Sandbox, one of several "virtual world" websites where people can socialise, play games and even attend concerts.That came hot on the heels of a $2.4-million land purchase in late November on a rival platform, Decentraland, by Canadian crypto company Tokens.com. And days before that, Barbados announced plans to open a "metaverse embassy" in Decentraland.Such websites bill themselves as a prototype of the metaverse, a future internet where online experiences like chatting to a friend would eventually feel face-to-face thanks to virtual reality (VR) headsets."Metaverse" has been a Silicon Valley buzzword for months, but interest soared in October after Facebook's parent company renamed itself "Meta" as it shifts its focus towards VR.The Facebook rebrand "introduced the term 'metaverse' to millions of people a lot faster than I would have ever imagined," said Cathy Hackl, a tech consultant who advises companies on entering the metaverse.According to crypto data site Dapp, land worth more than $100 million has sold in the past week across the four largest metaverse sites, The Sandbox, Decentraland, CryptoVoxels, and Somnium Space.For Hackl, it's unsurprising that the market is booming, spawning an entire ecosystem around virtual real estate, from rents to land developers."We're trying to translate the way we understand physical goods into the virtual world," she told AFP.And while it may be some time before these sites operate as true metaverses, transporting us elsewhere with VR goggles, digital land is already functioning as an asset just like real land, said Hackl."They can build on it, they can rent it out, they can sell it," she said.'Fifth Avenue of the metaverse'Tokens.com has bought a prime patch in Decentraland's Fashion Street district, which the platform hopes to develop as a home for luxury brands' virtual stores."If I hadn't done the research and understood that this is valuable property, it would seem absolutely crazy," admitted Tokens.com CEO Andrew Kiguel.Kiguel spent 20 years as an investment banker focused on real estate. He insists the Decentraland plot makes exactly the same kind of business sense as it would in the real world: it's in a trendy area with high footfall."That is advertising and event space where people are going to congregate," he explained, pointing to a recent virtual musical festival in Decentraland which attracted 50,000 visitors.Luxury brands are already venturing into the metaverse -- a Gucci handbag sold on the Roblox platform in May for more than the real version -- and Kiguel hopes Fashion Street will become a shopping destination akin to New York's Fifth Avenue.As for how the land could be used to make money, "it can be as simple as having a billboard, or it can be as complex as having a storefront with an actual employee," he said."You could walk in with your avatar and have 3D digital representations of a shoe that you can hold, and ask questions."Second Life, rebootedAs far back as 2006, a real estate developer made headlines after making $1 million from land sold on the virtual world site Second Life.While Second Life remains active, proponents of its next-generation rivals point out a key difference.In Decentraland, everything from land to virtual artwork comes in the form of a non-fungible token, or NFT.Some people have spent tens of thousands of dollars on these digital items, and the concept has generated scepticism as well as excitement.But Kiguel predicts this form of digital ownership will become widespread in the coming years, because the blockchain technology behind it creates trust and transparency when making transactions."I can see the ownership history, what's been paid for it and how it's been transferred around," he said.But the investment is not without its risks -- particularly given the volatility of the cryptocurrencies used to buy NFTs.And while virtual concerts on sites like Roblox and Fortnite have drawn tens of millions of viewers, the sparse data available suggests traffic on metaverses like Decentraland lags far behind that of established social media sites like Facebook and Instagram.Ultimately the value of the land investments depends on whether people start flocking to these sites."I know it all sounds quite ludicrous," said Kiguel. "But there's a vision behind it."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/metaverse-hype-fuels-booming-digital-property-market-101638694661663.html

Not Chancellor Angela Merkel.During 16 years in power, the veteran navigated Germany through the 2008 financial turmoil and ensuing eurozone debt crisis, the 2015 refugee influx and then the coronavirus pandemic.While largely admired at home and abroad even in the final days of her reign, the legacy she leaves behind is marked both by light and shadows.Party in crisisMerkel scraped to a narrow win in 2005 against incumbent chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of the Social Democrats, putting her conservative CDU-CSU alliance on the path of power for over a decade.At the zenith of her popularity, Merkel led the conservatives to a thumping win with 41.5 percent of the vote in 2013.With her track record, she was able to end a crucial TV election debate that year with the simple closing words "you know me".But her exit from politics was marred by a succession crisis in her party, culminating in a humiliating loss at September's general elections that sent it into the opposition for the next four years.Budget dogmaOnce dismissed as the sick man of Europe, Germany cemented its reputation as the continent's economic engine on Merkel's watch.Unemployment is at record lows -- 5.3 percent in November even as the economy is struggling with the impact of the pandemic.Budget surpluses chalked up from 2012 also allowed the ageing nation to pay down a huge debt mountain, giving it a buffer against the impact of the health emergency.But Germany's fixation with balanced budgets has left a sour taste, particularly among southern Europeans battered by the financial and eurozone debt crises.Merkel appeared to ignore pleas for debt relief when Greece was on the brink of economic collapse, triggering huge demonstrations in the country.While credited with securing huge European bailouts that saved Greece from crashing out of the euro, it was achieved at a heavy social cost including massive job losses.But it was Covid-19 that forced her to make a drastic U-turn on her resistance to mutualising European debt.Instead, Merkel spearheaded the 800-billion-euro ($950-billion) EU recovery fund, which sees the European Commission raising money by issuing bonds on behalf of all 27 members.Climate chancellor?Merkel made the startling decision to shut Germany's nuclear power plants in the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima disaster, triggering the "Energiewende" -- the shift to sustainable energy.But the sudden policy shift forced greater reliance on coal energy in the transition period as the country battled to ramp up wind and biomass energy output.Merkel's government was accused of protecting Germany's vital automobile industry by watering down emissions regulation reforms, and its refusal to advance a 2038 deadline to quit coal energy also irked green activists.In a humiliating ruling against the government's flagship environmental protection plan, Germany's highest court in April ordered Merkel's coalition to draw up an improved plan.Her government subsequently brought forward targets to slash CO2 emissions by 65 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, from an earlier goal of 55 percent."When I look at the situation, no one can say that we have done enough" for the environment, admitted Merkel in June."Time is pressing. I can understand the impatience of young people."Business as usual?Merkel was lauded by human rights activists in 2015 for keeping Germany's borders open to hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing war in Syria and Iraq.But on China's mass incarceration of Uyghurs in the far western region of Xinjiang, Merkel was accused of lacking bite.Critics said she was hamstrung by huge economic interests in China.Likewise, while Merkel spoke out firmly against Russia over the poisoning and jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, she stuck to her guns on completing a controversial gas pipeline called Nord Stream 2.Far right, Europe fault linesThe arrival of more than a million asylum seekers in Germany further fractured the political landscape.Popular anger over the mass influx sent a far-right bloc, the anti-immigration AfD, to parliament in 2017 for the first time since World War II, making it the biggest opposition force.It also opened up a fault line with former Eastern bloc nations including Hungary and Poland, which have dug in their heels against the new arrivals.Six years on, the European Union has been unable to agree on unified migration policies.Legacy for womenAs Germany's first female chancellor, Merkel smashed the glass ceiling and became a role model for women politicians around the world.But it was only at the very end of her time in office that she declared herself a feminist, having long resisted the term -- too little, too late for some in Germany.Critics say her government failed to make structural changes to benefit women in German society, such as reforming Germany's tax system for married couples -- a long-standing feminist plea.The country's gender pay gap also remains among the highest in the European Union and stood at 19 percent in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austerity-far-right-feminism-merkel-s-ambivalent-legacy-101638694705757.html

President Joe Biden's administration has said this year it would proceed with the sale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-says-french-rafale-fighter-jets-not-a-substitute-for-us-f-35-warplanes-101638695080835.html

"I owe them all and will miss that group of special people who did really important work."Cuomo has spoken candidly of his strong bond with his older sibling."He's my brother. And if I can help my brother, I do. If he wants me to hear something, I will. If he wants me to weigh in on something, I'll try," he told investigators in July when asked about the counsel he had offered."He's my brother, and I love him to death no matter what."Democrat Andrew Cuomo was elected governor three times before resigning in August after New York's attorney general said an investigation concluded he had sexually harassed at least 11 women.In October, the former governor -- whose father Mario Cuomo had also been governor of New York -- was charged with a misdemeanor sex crime for forcible touching.At the start of the pandemic, the Cuomo brothers soared to new heights of popularity: Andrew, 63, earned praise for his frank daily briefings as the coronavirus ravaged New York, and his live exchanges with Chris on CNN were peppered with banter.The investigation into Chris Cuomo's conduct remains ongoing, CNN said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cnn-terminates-chris-cuomo-over-help-he-gave-to-governor-brother-andrew-101638694752795.html

They put us on a platter for everyone who can just come and take whatever they want," Vladislava Cvoric, a 56-year old economist, told AFP during the protest.Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic shared a photograph of the protest on Instagram and commented that "clean air, water and food are keys to health"."Without that, every word about 'health' is obsolete", Djokovic added.The protests followed similar demonstrations last week during which masked men attacked one gathering in western Serbia's Sabac -- sparking outrage on social media and accusations the government was using hooligans to suppress the movement.Substantial deposits of lithium -- a key component for electric car batteries -- are found around the western town of Loznica, where the Anglo-Australian company is buying up land but is still awaiting the final green light from the state to begin mining.Rio Tinto discovered lithium reserves in the Loznica region in 2006.The company intends to invest $2.4 billion (2.12 billion euros) in the project, according to Vesna Prodanovic, director of Rio Sava, Rio Tinto's sister company in Serbia.Critics have accused President Aleksandar Vucic's government of setting the stage for illegal land appropriations and ignoring environmental concerns.The demonstrations come months ahead of likely national elections next year, with critics of the protests accusing organisers of stirring controversy to undermine Vucic before the polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-block-roads-in-serbia-to-protest-mining-project-101638694784674.html

Ninety-eight have been injured, including two pregnant women, and 902 have been evacuated, the statement said.Thoriqul Haq, a local official in Lumajang, said earlier that sand miners had been trapped around their work sites.BNPB said at least 35 people had been hospitalised, while Lumajang's deputy head said 41 people suffered burns.Semeru, more than 3,600 metres (12,000 feet) high, is one of Indonesia's nearly 130 active volcanoes. It erupted in January, causing no casualties.Indonesia straddles the "Pacific Ring of Fire", a highly seismically active zone, where different plates on the earth’s crust meet and create a large number of earthquakes and volcanoes.Separately, an earthquake of magnitude 6 struck north of Halmahera on Sunday, the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said. Halmahera is about 2,000 km (1,200 miles) northeast of Semeru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesias-semeru-volcanic-eruption-kills-13-official-says-101638672290130.html

The United States has announced new testing rules for inbound travellers which will take effect from Monday amid global alarm over Omicron variant of coronavirus. The air passengers entering the US will have to obtain a negative Covid-19 test within one day of travel.The current requirement allows travellers to produce a negative Covid test within three days of boarding their flight. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky's order says all air travellers, “regardless of citizenship or vaccination status, will be required to show a negative pre-departure Covid-19 viral test taken the day before they board their flight to the United States."Britain has also tightened its travel guidelines, requiring all travellers, regardless of their vaccination status, to take a pre-flight Covid test within 48 hours prior to their flight. The new travel rules will take effect from Tuesday. UK health minister Sajid Javid said that the new travel requirement will be temporary and be reviewed as the omicron outbreak develops. Both the US and the UK have allowed travellers to take either an antigen test or a PCR test.4 Omicron cases in India: What their age, travel and vaccination history revealJapan will add India, Greece, Romania and four US states under strict quarantine vigilance in a bid to curb the spread of Omicron, Kyodo news reported. Foreigners, as well as Japanese nationals travelling from Colorado, Hawaii, Minnesota and New York, will have to mandatorily spend three days of their two-week quarantine at government-designated facilities.While most of the countries have reported infections in travellers from south African nations, the United States and Australia have confirmed local transmission as Omicron’s potential to evade immunity from vaccination and prior infections remains unclear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-alarm-what-are-the-new-testing-rules-for-inbound-us-uk-travellers-101638668337345.html

"It looks a lot like rehearsals."Some analysts have suggested Beijing may be testing Biden during his first year in office.China was the only power now capable of using its "economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system," Austin said.The world's two largest economic powers, he went on, have "real differences both over interests and values. But the way that you manage them counts."He said Chinese leaders had been increasingly vocal about their "dissatisfaction with the prevailing order -- and about their aim of displacing America from its global leadership role."But, Austin said: "We seek neither confrontation nor conflict.... We're not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs."In the face of the Chinese challenge, the retired four-star army general said, the US would be deepening its ties to friendly countries in the region, including through joint exercises."We remain steadfast to our One-China policy," Austin said, but also to "our commitments of the Taiwan Relations Act to support Taiwan's ability to defend itself while also maintaining our capacity to resist any resort to force that would jeopardize the security of the people of Taiwan."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-military-operations-near-taiwan-resemble-rehearsals-pentagon-chief-101638667470162.html

The West, including the European Union, Canada and Britain said the alleged actions of the Taliban constitute “serious human rights abuses” and contradict the amnesty announced by the ruling Sunni Pashtun group in Afghanistan.“We call on the Taliban to effectively enforce the amnesty for former members of the Afghan security forces and former Government officials to ensure that it is upheld across the country and throughout their ranks,” the joint statement read.The statement comes days after Human Rights Watch, an international human rights advocacy group, released a 25-page report on executions and enforced disappearances in Afghanistan under the Taliban. The report has documented the killing or disappearance of 47 former members of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) who had surrendered to or were apprehended by the Taliban after it took control of Kabul on August 15.“Reported cases must be investigated promptly and in a transparent manner, those responsible must be held accountable, and these steps must be clearly publicized as an immediate deterrent to further killings and disappearances,” the countries said, adding that they will continue to measure the Taliban by their actions.Among several commitments aimed at getting recognition from the international community, the Taliban had promised amnesty for the members of the Afghan security forces. But the reports of executions and enforced disappearances have exposed the contradiction which could prove a setback to the Taliban in its attempt to get recognition.The joint statement on the reported summary killings and enforced disappearances has been released by the US, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, the European Union, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/west-hits-out-at-taliban-over-summary-killings-enforced-disappearances-in-afghanistan-101638666459693.html

Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes instructed the country’s top prosecutor, Augusto Aras, to look into the accusation raised by a pandemic inquiry conducted by Brazil’s Senate.Bolsonaro said in an October 24 broadcast that “official reports from the UK government suggest that fully vaccinated people... are developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome much faster than anticipated.”The future of any probe is uncertain, however. Aras rarely goes against the president and has not opened an investigation into Bolsonaro’s handling of the pandemic despite calls to do so by the Senate committeeIt’s just a cold, says BidenUS President Joe Biden has at least one thing in common with thousands of parents and grandparents this winter: He’s picked up a cold from his young grandson.The president has had a scratchy voice and an occasional cough all week, prompting questions from the press about his health on Friday.He assured reporters that he’s tested daily for Covid and is negative. “What I have is a one-and-a-half year old grandson who had a cold who likes to kiss his pop,” he said. “It’s just a cold.”UK PM reported to copsBritish PM Boris Johnson has been reported to the policy by a Labour MP for allegedly hosting two parties at Downing street despite Covid-related restrictions last year, according to a report by The Guardian.Labour MP Neil Coyle has written to Metropolitan police commissioner Cressida Dick to investigate reports that Johnson attended two events, one in November and the other in December, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/probe-brazil-president-for-linking-jabs-to-aids-101638665514552.html
05-12-2021||World||China criticises US democracy ahead of Biden’s summit||Whether a country is democratic or not should be judged by the international community and not by a few “self-appointed judges”, China on Saturday said in an official document as it ramps up criticism against the upcoming US-organised Summit for Democracy.“There is no fixed model of democracy,” China said in the official document titled China: Democracy That Works, published on Saturday, which details its democratic endeavors.The document said whether a country is democratic “should be acknowledged by the international community, not arbitrarily decided by a few self-appointed judges”.“Over the past hundred years, the Party has led the people in realising people’s democracy in China. The Chinese people now truly hold in their hands their own future and that of society and the country,” the paper said, the official CGTN channel reported. China has termed its system “whole-process people’s democracy” after President Xi Jinping proposed the concept two years ago in Shanghai, according to official media.Ruled by the Communist Party of China (CPC) since 1949, China’s governance is firmly under the party’s control with all functions of the government – including the legislature and judiciary – fully compliant to rules laid down by the CPC.China’s legislature, the National People’s Congress, is considered largely ceremonial and a rubber-stamp for decisions finalised by the CPC.Considered to have become increasingly authoritarian under Xi, the phrase “whole-process democracy” was enshrined in law this past March.Beijing has sharply criticised the Summit for Democracy to be held next week with Communist Party of China (CPC) officials calling it a “joke” at the release of the Chinese document on democracy on Saturday.“The US is a self-styled leader of democracy, but its so-called summit of democracy is only aimed at suppressing and containing countries with a different development model,” said Tian Peiyan, deputy director of the Policy Research Office of the CPC’s central committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-criticises-us-democracy-ahead-of-biden-s-summit-101638664395154.html

05-12-2021||World||‘Omicron could dent global economic growth’||The International Monetary Fund is likely to lower its global economic growth estimates due to the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus, the global lender’s chief said on Friday in another sign of the turmoil unleashed by the ever-changing pandemic.Omicron has spread rapidly to at least 40 countries since it was first reported in South Africa last week, officials say, and many governments have tightened travel rules to try to keep it out.“A new variant that may spread very rapidly can dent confidence, and in that sense, we are likely to see some downgrades of our October projections for global growth,” IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said.Much remains unknown about Omicron. Researchers said it could have picked up genetic material from another virus, perhaps one that causes the common cold, which would allow it to more easily evade human immune system defences.By inserting this particular snippet into itself, Omicron might be making itself look “more human”, which would help it evade attack by the human immune system, said Venky Soundararajan of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based data analytics firm nference, who led the study posted on Thursday on the website OSF Preprints.Parts of Europe and the US are grappling with a wave of infections of the more familiar Delta variant. The new strain could further destabilise economies that are still emerging from Covid-19 related lockdowns and disruptions.The variant has now reached at least 10 US states, and White House chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci said there is “absolutely” community spread.The states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Maryland and Nebraska reported Omicron infections on Friday, and cases are guaranteed to keep on increasing in the coming days, according to Fauci.Covid-19 infections in the US are at the highest level in two months. Infections had been rising even before the discovery and arrival of Omicron. The seven-day average of cases in the US was 100,835 as of Thursday, the most since October 6, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg.Cases of the Omicron in the Norwegian capital of Oslo linked to a corporate Christmas party may rise to as many as 100, public broadcaster NRK reported. So far it has resulted in at least 13 infections, making it the biggest outbreak outside of South Africa, officials said.England has identified 75 more infections caused by the Omicron variant, tripling the total caseload to 104.Separately, China reported 75 new infections of Covid-19, as an outbreak in a border town expanded. Inner Mongolia, where the flare-up is concentrated, added 61 cases, and a further three people without symptoms also tested positive, the National Health Commission said, without specifying if any infections were due to Omicron.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-could-dent-global-economic-growth-101638664469101.html

The official added that the plans call for the movement of 100 Russian battalion tactical groups along with armour, artillery and equipment.Intelligence officials also have seen an uptick in Russian propaganda efforts through the use of proxies and media outlets to denigrate Ukraine and Nato ahead of a potential invasion, the official said.
