Recent History"."After all, what is the collapse of the Soviet Union? This is the collapse of historical Russia under the name of the Soviet Union," the Russian leader was cited as saying.A loyal servant of the Soviet Union, Putin was dismayed when it fell apart, once calling the collapse "the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th century".Putin is sensitive to the perceived expansion of Western military ambitions into ex-Soviet countries and Russia this week demanded that NATO formally scrap a 2008 decision to open its door to Georgia and Ukraine.The end of the Union brought with it a period of intense economic instability that plunged many into poverty, as newly independent Russia transitioned from communism to capitalism.RIA-Novosti, reporting from excerpts of the documentary, said Putin had revealed that he worked occasionally as a taxi driver to boost his income."Sometimes I had to earn extra money," Putin said."I mean, earn extra money by car, as a private driver. It's unpleasant to talk about to be honest but, unfortunately, that was the case."Russia was the centre of the Soviet Union that grew to include 15 republics from the Baltics in the West to Central Asia.In 1991, wracked by economic woes the Soviet Union disintegrated and Russia became an independent nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-says-he-had-to-drive-cab-to-make-ends-meet-after-soviet-fall-101639331545734.html

The UK, South Africa were among the countries where faster transmission of the cases have been noted. The Delta variant, previously, was less prevalent in South Africa while it was the dominant variant in Britain.In India, several states and districts reported cases of Omicron variant on Sunday as the total caseload pertaining to the strain reached 38.The variant was first identified in South Africa and the WHO announced it as a variant of concern back in November.Covid-19 vaccine makers Pfizer and BioNTech had said last week that three doses of their vaccine appeared effective against the variant, based on initial laboratory tests.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-covid-19-variant-more-transmissible-reduces-vaccine-efficiency-who-101639330799448.html

12-12-2021||World||‘It becomes clear…’: Anthony Fauci on booster dose amid Omicron threat||Top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci on Sunday said three doses of a vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is the “optimal care” but the government will stick to the official definition of fully vaccinated. Speaking at ABC’s ‘This Week With George Stephanopoulos’, Fauci said two doses of mRNA vaccines, Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna, and one shot of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine will remain the official requirement to determine fully vaccinated individuals."For official requirements, it's still two shots of the mRNA (Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna) and one shot of the J&J for the official determination of what's required or not. But I think if you look at the data, the more and more it becomes clear that if you want to be optimally protected you really should get a booster," the top immunologist said.Fauci’s comment on additional dose comes at a time when the rich nations are expanding their booster program for younger people amid fears of Omicron evading vaccine-induced immunity. The United States has cleared Pfizer booster dose for 16-17-year-olds and Britain is set to open the bookings for booster shots for all people aged 30 and above from December 13.Covid-19: UK govt announces new measures, boosters to all above 30 to check Omicron spreadThe World Health Organization (WHO) said in a technical briefing that Omicron is more transmissible than the Delta strain and reduces vaccine efficacy.

12-12-2021||World||US tornadoes: At least 94 dead, several towns affected, rescue ops continue||US rescuers desperately searched for survivors Sunday after tornadoes killed at least 94 and left towns in ruin, with emergency crews racing against time to find dozens still missing from a collapsed Kentucky factory.President Joe Biden called the wave of twisters, including one that traveled more than 200 miles (320 kilometers), "one of the largest" storm outbreaks in American history."It's a tragedy," a shaken Biden, who pledged support for the affected states, said in televised comments. "And we still don't know how many lives are lost and the full extent of the damage."With the death toll all but certain to rise, scores of search and rescue officers were helping stunned citizens across the US heartland sift through the rubble of their homes and businesses overnight.More than 80 people are dead in Kentucky alone, many of them workers at a candle factory in Mayfield, the state's Governor Andy Beshear said Sunday as he raised the confirmed toll by 10 fatalities.And the forecast was grim. "That number is going to exceed more than 100," Beshear told CNN.Meanwhile, at least six died in an Amazon warehouse in Illinois where they were on the night shift processing orders ahead of Christmas.Emergency crews worked through the night into Sunday at both locations, but the Kentucky governor's somber remarks suggested his state's residents should brace for the worst.Of the 110 employees working Friday night in the candle factory, "about 40 of them have been rescued and I'm not sure we're going to see another rescue," Beshear said."I pray for it," he said, but "it would be an incredible miracle" if more factory victims were found alive.As Americans grappled with the immensity of the disaster, condolences poured in, with Pope Francis saying he is praying "for the victims of the tornado that hit Kentucky."Biden's Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, in a break from tense bilateral relations, said his country "shares in the grief" of those who lost loved ones and expressed hope that victims quickly overcome the tornadoes' consequences.The catastrophe has shaken many Americans, including officials who have worked in the aftermath of tornadoes and other big storms."This event is the worst, most devastating, most deadly tornado event in Kentucky's history," Beshear said Saturday, adding he fears "we will have lost more than 100 people.""The devastation is unlike anything I have seen in my life, and I have trouble putting it into words."The head of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency, Deanne Criswell, was to arrive in Kentucky Sunday.The largest tornado among the swarm that smashed through the US South and Midwest had rumbled along the ground for over 200 miles (320 kilometers), Beshear said, one of the longest on record.The longest a US tornado has ever tracked along the ground was a 219-mile storm in Missouri in 1925. It claimed 695 lives.'Hope for a miracle'The western Kentucky town of Mayfield was reduced to "matchsticks," its mayor Kathy O'Nan said."There's always hope" for survivors among the missing, O'Nan told NBC Sunday. "We hope for a miracle in the days to come."The town of 10,000 was described as "ground zero" by officials, and appeared post-apocalyptic: city blocks leveled; historic homes and buildings beaten down to their slabs; tree trunks stripped of their branches; cars overturned in fields.Some Christmas decorations could still be seen by the side of the road.David Norseworthy, a 69-year-old builder in Mayfield, said the storm blew off his roof and front porch while the family hid in a shelter."We never had anything like that here," he told AFP.In one demonstration of the storms' power, when winds derailed a 27-car train near Earlington, Kentucky, one car was blown 75 yards up a hill and another landed on a house. No one was hurt.Deaths in multiple statesReports put the total number of tornadoes across the region at around 30.At least 14 people were killed in other storm-hit states, including six at the Amazon facility in Illinois.Four were killed in Tennessee, two died in Arkansas, while Missouri recorded two fatalities. Tornadoes also touched down in Mississippi.Biden said he planned to travel to the affected areas.Amazon workers trappedAt the Amazon warehouse in the southern Illinois city of Edwardsville, around 100 workers are believed to have been trapped inside."We identified 45 personnel who made it out of the building safely... and six fatalities," Edwardsville fire chief James Whiteford told reporters.But he said the operation had turned from rescue to focus "only on recovery," fueling fears the toll will rise.Amazon chief Jeff Bezos said he was "heartbroken" at the deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-tornadoes-at-least-94-dead-several-towns-affected-rescue-ops-continue-101639327502945.html

The over-30s can get a third dose of a vaccine from next week.The government in London sets policy for England only. Health is a devolved matter for the governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.The announcement adds to new proposals from Prime Minister Boris Johnson to combat Omicron, including a return to home-working, and the possible introduction of vaccine passports in certain settings.MPs vote on the proposals on Tuesday, with Johnson facing a potentially sizeable rebellion from his own Conservative members. The vote, though is likely to pass with Labour support.Britain -- one of the worst-hit countries by Covid-19 with more than 146,000 deaths -- began its mass vaccination campaign just over a year ago.Infection rates remain stubbornly high at about 50,000 positive tests per day.On Sunday, government minister Nadim Zahawi said the first people with Omicron had been taken to hospital, just over two weeks after the variant was detected in Britain.In London, Omicron is now responsible for about a third of all Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-uk-govt-announces-new-measures-boosters-to-all-above-30-to-check-omicron-spread-101639326348143.html

No details are available regarding the charges on which he was convicted, according to RFA.Speaking to RFA, a Tibetan scholar living in exile described Gyatso - who had written books and articles describing restrictions on freedom of expression under Chinese rule - as an "open-minded individual who advocates the preservation of Tibetan language, religion and culture.""It's sad news to hear about his 10-year sentence on Human Rights Day, and I want to call on the United Nations, governments around the world, and the international community to look into this matter immediately," he added.Earlier, the Chinese government in October responded to a July 16 letter from U.N. human rights experts asking about Gyatso's case, telling them that Gyatso had been placed in criminal detention "in accordance with the law on suspicion of inciting secession."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sentences-tibetan-writer-to-10-year-prison-for-his-loyalty-to-dalai-lama-101639316729639.html
12-12-2021||World||Booking for Covid boosters to open for all over 30s in UK amid Omicron threat||British health officials on Sunday said that people aged 30 and above will be able to book appointments for vaccine booster shots against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) from Monday, December 13 amid concerns over the Omicron variant. The NHS said in a statement that the national booking system for Covid vaccines will now be open to people aged 30 to 39 so they can get the booster shot three months after receiving the second dose.The booking can be made two months following their second dose, which means a month in advance of becoming eligible to receive the additional jab. Of 7.5 million people in Britain aged 30 to 29, about 3.5 million people will be eligible for a booster shot from tomorrow. The vaccine policy was revised following updated advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.“The Covid-19 booster programme is accelerating rapidly and more than 22 million people in the UK have already received their top-up, securing vital protection ahead of Christmas,” UK health secretary Sajid Javid said.The vaccine program of the National Health Service (NHS) was expanded after the UK health security agency (UKHSA) found that the additional dose of the Covid vaccine significantly restores protection against mild disease caused by the new variant of concern. The emergence of Omicron has left researchers scrambling for more data to determine the transmissibility of the new variant of concern and the severity of disease caused by it.Cautioning against the preliminary findings on protection against Omicron, Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the UKHSA, said the early estimates do indicate that there is a greater risk of contracting the Omicron variant as against the Delhi variant a few months after taking the second dose of the Covid vaccine.“The data suggest this risk is significantly reduced following a booster vaccine, so I urge everyone to take up their booster when eligible,” Ramsay added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/booking-for-covid-boosters-to-open-for-all-over-30s-in-uk-amid-omicron-threat-101639307999517.html
12-12-2021||World||New Caledonia rejects independence from France in third referendum||Residents of the Pacific territory of New Caledonia voted overwhelmingly on Sunday to remain part of France in a third referendum that was boycotted by pro-independence groups, reports say.Police reinforcements have been sent to the territory known as "the pebble", which is of strategic importance to France and is part of a wider tussle for influence in the Pacific between Western countries and China.Local television channel NC la 1ere reported that, with 90.23 percent of ballots counted, 96.32 percent of voters had voted "No" to independence in a result that will raise fears of unrest and questions about the legitimacy of the process.The archipelago of about 185,000 voters, 2,000 kilometres (1,250 miles) east of Australia, was granted three independence referendums under a 1988 deal aimed at easing tensions on the islands.Turnout on Sunday was only 41.60 percent by 5 pm local time (0600 GMT).Having rejected a breakaway from France in 2018 and then again last year, the inhabitants were asked one last time: "Do you want New Caledonia to accede to full sovereignty and become independent?"Pro-independence campaigners boycotted the vote, saying they wanted it postponed to September because "a fair campaign" was impossible with high coronavirus infection numbers.The result could exacerbate ethnic tensions, with the poorer indigenous Kanak community generally favouring independence over the wealthier white community.The main indigenous pro-independence movement, the FLNKS, had called the government's insistence on going ahead with the referendum "a declaration of war"."This referendum does not make too much sense because half the population has decided not to vote," Cathy, a bookseller who gave only her first name, told AFP at a polling booth in the capital Noumea."I came out of civic-mindedness, what interests me is the society we are going to build afterwards," she told AFP.Turnout was particularly low in Kanak-majority areas, AFP reporters witnessed.- Fears of Chinese influence -At stake in the vote was one of France's biggest overseas territories which is home to about 10 percent of the world's reserves of nickel, which is used to make stainless steel, batteries and mobile phones.The territory is also a key part of France's claim of being a Pacific power, with New Caledonia granting France rights to the surrounding ocean, as well as a military staging post.Experts suspect that an independent New Caledonia would move closer to Beijing, which has built up close economic links and political influence on other Pacific islands."If the French safeguard disappears, all elements would be in place for China to establish itself permanently in New Caledonia," said French international relations analyst Bastien Vandendyck.Other nations in the region, including Fiji, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, had already become "Chinese satellites", Vandendyck told AFP."All China needs now to complete its pearl necklace on Australia's doorstep is New Caledonia," he said.China is already the biggest single client for New Caledonia's metal exports.- Fresh vote on future 'project' -French President Emmanuel Macron has avoided taking sides in the referendum debate, saying Thursday that his role was to ensure the vote "takes place in the right way and in the right conditions."He is expected to make a statement on Sunday at 1200 GMT and is desperate to avoid any more overseas unrest following violent protests on the French Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique last month.Around 2,000 police and troops were deployed for Sunday's vote, which appeared to have passed off largely without incident except for an attempted roadblock on an outlying island.France has 13 overseas territories, home to 2.7 million people, which are generally poorer and have higher unemployment than the mainland, leading to long-standing accusations of neglect.Some such as French Polynesia have been granted large degrees of autonomy and attention will now turn to the future status of New Caledonia, whose regional council could be granted more powers.Another referendum is expected by June 2023 which will decide on the "project" New Caledonia's people want to pursue.The pro-independence movement has threatened not to recognise Sunday's result and has vowed to appeal to the United Nations to get it cancelled.New Caledonia was largely spared during the pandemic's first phase, but have suffered close to 300 Covid-19 deaths since the Delta variant arrived.Some observers fear the tensions could spark a return of the kind of violence last seen in the 1980s when clashes broke out between the pro-independence Kanaks and white French people who opposed independence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-caledonia-rejects-independence-from-france-in-third-referendum-101639308735486.html

The continued military build-up in areas close to Ukraine has raised concern over a Russian invasion, with US intelligence officers determining that the attack can take place as early as January 2022. Taking cognisance of the issue, the G7 delegates condemned Russia’s military build-up and called on Kremlin to de-escalate, reported Reuters."Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe cost," the draft statement said, as quoted by Reuters.The escalation prompted US President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to hold discussions last Tuesday over a secured telephone call. On Saturday, Biden said he warned Putin of consequences that would be “devastating” for Russia’s economy if Kremlin launches a military offensive against Ukraine."I made it absolutely clear to President Putin...that if he moves on Ukraine, the economic consequences for his economy are going to be devastating, devastating," said Biden, while stressing that sending US ground combat troops in the event of a Russian invasion “was never on the table.”Russia, China top agenda as G7 ministers call for unity against authoritarianismRussia has meanwhile denied planning an attack, saying it is moving the troops to thwart any destabilising behaviour from the United States and Ukraine near border areas. In an interview with Greek TV channel ANT1, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia can move its forces wherever it wants.When asked whether Russia was planning to invade Ukraine, Peksov said, "No, the problem is very simple. Russia is moving its forces within its territory and we can move our forces in any direction we want and closer to the areas that could pose a threat [and currently] we see US warplanes landing in Ukraine and US military equipment approaching our borders.”(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-nations-warn-russia-of-massive-consequences-if-it-invades-ukraine-101639307125913.html

Emergency responders expect recovery efforts to continue into next week.Amazon had for years prohibited workers from carrying their phones on warehouse floors, requiring them to leave them in vehicles or employee lockers before passing through security checks that include metal detectors. The company backed off during the pandemic, but has been gradually reintroducing it at facilities around the country.Five Amazon employees, including two who work across the street from the building that collapsed, said they want access to information such as updates on potentially deadly weather events through their smartphones -- without interference from Amazon. The phones can also help them communicate with emergency responders or loved ones if they are trapped, they said. “After these deaths, there is no way in hell I am relying on Amazon to keep me safe,” said one worker from a neighboring Amazon facility in Illinois. “If they institute the no cell phone policy, I am resigning.”Biden Approves Help for Kentucky After Tornadoes Kill DozensAnother worker from an Amazon warehouse in Indiana said she is using up her paid time off whenever the company decides to remain open despite warnings of extreme weather events. Having her phone with her is critical to making those decisions, especially about sudden tornado risks, she said.“I don’t trust them with my safety to be quite frank,” she said. “If there’s severe weather on the way, I think I should be able to make my own decision about safety.”Amazon declined to address the concerns raised by workers about its mobile phone policy, saying its focus now is “on assisting the brave first responders on the scene and supporting our affected employees and partners in the area.”The concerns about phone access highlight the deep distrust between executives who make rules focused on productivity and efficiency to gain a competitive advantage, and hourly front-line workers who often fear their safety is secondary to moving packages. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the world’s wealthiest man after Elon Musk, only fueled such feelings by spending the earlier part of Saturday celebrating a celebrity space launch by his company Blue Origin while emergency crews at the warehouse dug through rubble looking for bodies.At around 8 p.m. Central time, Bezos tweeted to offer his well wishes. One person familiar with Amazon’s warehouse construction said the buildings are designed to local standards that account for events such as severe storms and snow loads. Warehouses in tornado-prone areas include space that is more heavily reinforced with extra steel and concrete where workers are instructed to huddle in event of emergencies, he said. Still, extreme weather events can topple buildings. In 2018, two Amazon warehouse workers died in Baltimore when a building partially collapsed in a strong storm. The National Weather Service puts out extreme weather alerts via text messages, letting the public know in advance about dangerous conditions. Tornadoes are trickier to anticipate than hurricanes and snowstorms, but the weather service still issues warnings to those in their path. The weather service sent such a warning at about 8 p.m. local time Friday, about 30 minutes before the storm collapsed the Edwardsville Amazon delivery station, the workers said. Two Amazon employees who work in a facility across the street said workers huddled in bathrooms to protect themselves from the storm, unaware the building across the street had collapsed. Power outages blocked communications. They were sent home from work after 11 p.m. when it was deemed safe to travel.“After this, everyone is definitely afraid of not being able to keep their phones on them,” one of the workers said. “Most employees that I’ve talked to don’t keep their phones on them for personal conversation throughout the day, It’s genuinely for situations like this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deadly-collapse-at-amazon-warehouse-puts-spotlight-on-phone-ban-101639279243003.html

The UK recorded 58,194 cases on Friday, the highest number since January, though what portion were the Omicron variant is unclear.Modelling released on Saturday by scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggested Omicron is likely to cause a large wave of infections by January, and could cause between 25,000 and 75,000 deaths in England in the next five months if no other measures are taken.The most pessimistic scenario foresees half a million people hospitalised with the virus by the end of April and said daily hospital admissions could be double the previous peak in January 2021. The study by the scientists, who help advise the British government, has not been peer reviewed.French health authorities have approved the use of an anti-body treatment made by AstraZeneca for high-risk people who show resistance to vaccines against coronavirus.The independent public health body HAS on Friday night announced “a greenlight for the preventive use of Evusheld... for patients with a very high-risk of contracting a severe form of Covid-19”.Evusheld, developed by the British-Swedish pharma company, this week received emergency use authorisation in the US for adults and children aged 12 and above.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is developing analytical models to determine when reopening travel from eight southern African countries would no longer impact the spread of the Omicron variant in the US, with an eye towards lifting restrictions implemented last month, the White House said on Friday.Taiwan has recorded its first case of the Omicron variant in a passenger who recently travelled to the southern African country of Eswatini.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-may-kill-25k-to-75k-in-england-if-measures-not-taken-101639271277919.html

Covid-19 vaccine to Pfizer Inc.’s as a recommended booster shot and reduced the waiting time, responding to concerns about the increased spread caused by the omicron variant.Australia is cutting the standard waiting time for a booster shot to five months from six, following the first two doses. The approval came from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunization, the health department said Sunday in a statement. “ATAGI has also updated its advice and recommends booster doses be provided from five months after completion of the primary course, given the likelihood of ongoing transmission of both omicron and delta variants,” the department said.Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales, saw the pace of new cases decline for the first time in six days. The state said Sunday there were 485 new infections, versus 560 reported Saturday. Victoria state said it recorded 1,069 additional cases, down from 1,193.The health department said more than 670,000 Australians had already received more than two doses of vaccine. The move to reduce waiting times means some 1.5 million people will be eligible for a booster starting Sunday, the Herald Sun newspaper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-adds-moderna-as-vaccine-booster-cuts-wait-time-for-3rd-shot-101639270218453.html

The ministry also claimed the summit was organised by the US to “draw lines of ideological prejudice, instrumentalise and weaponise democracy... (and) incite division and confrontation”.Instead, Beijing vowed to “resolutely resist and oppose all kinds of pseudo-democracies”.Ahead of the summit, China ramped up a propaganda blitz criticising US democracy as corrupt and a failure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/strengthen-democracy-biden-to-world-leaders-101639270952567.html

12-12-2021||World||Some 400,000 Palestinians vote in rare municipal elections||Palestinians took part in rare municipal elections across the occupied West Bank on Saturday, following months of simmering anger towards their government and the cancellation of promised parliamentary and presidential elections earlier this year.Some 400,000 Palestinians are eligible to vote in the election where they will select representatives for 154 village councils under the jurisdiction of the Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority. Municipal elections are typically held every four to five years and last took place in 2017.The increasingly unpopular president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, confined the election to rural municipalities, postponing voting in the West Bank's major cities where anger towards his ruling Fatah party is most acute.Saturday's elections are also being boycotted by the militant group Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip. Hamas's spokesman, Abdulatif al-Qanou, told the Associated Press that the group wants parliamentary and presidential elections and considers holding the municipal vote alone a violation of previous agreements.Today's vote does not “satisfy the inspiration and needs of the Palestinian people.“ The popularity of the Palestinian government has plummeted since Abbas canceled long-awaited legislative and parliamentary elections in April.Abbas blamed the cancellation on uncertainty around whether Palestinians from east Jerusalem would be able to vote, although critics accused him of postponing out of fear that his party would lose to Hamas.Popularity for the militant group has surged among Palestinians in the West Bank and east Jerusalem since May's 11-day war, with many accusing the Palestinian Authority of doing little to aid their struggle against Israeli occupation.Anger towards the government has been further inflamed by the growing crackdown on political dissent, following the death of Palestinian Authority critic Nizar Banat, who died after being beaten by Palestinian security forces. The event ignited widespread demonstrations calling for Abbas' resignation.The Palestinian Authority administers parts of the occupied West Bank through agreements signed with Israel during the height of the peace process in the 1990s. In 2007 Hamas drove Abbas' forces out of Gaza when it seized power after winning parliamentary elections. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, territories Palestinians seek for a future state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-400-000-palestinians-vote-in-rare-municipal-elections-101639247843617.html
