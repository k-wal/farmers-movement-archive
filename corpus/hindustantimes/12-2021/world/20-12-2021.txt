The new guidelines come nearly a year after some current and former service members participated in the riot at the U.S. Capitol, triggering a broad department review.Senior defense officials tell The Associated Press that fewer than 100 military members are known to have been involved in substantiated cases of extremist activity in the past year, but they warn that the number may grow given recent spikes in domestic violent extremism, particularly among veterans.Officials said the new policy doesn't largely change what is prohibited, but is more of an effort to make sure troops are clear on what they can and can't do, while still protecting their First Amendment free speech rights. And for the first time, it is far more specific about social media.The new policy lays out in detail the banned activities, which range from advocating terrorism or supporting the overthrow of the government to fundraising or rallying on behalf of an extremist group or “liking” or reposting extremist views on social media. The rules also specify that commanders must determine two things in order for someone to be held accountable: that the action was an extremist activity, as defined in the rules, and that the service member “actively participated” in that prohibited activity.Previous policies banned extremist activities but didn't go into such great detail, and also did not specify the two step process to determine someone accountable.What was wrong yesterday is still wrong today, said one senior defense official. But several officials said that as a study group spoke with service members this year they found that many wanted clearer definitions of what was not allowed. The officials spoke about the new rules on condition of anonymity because they have not yet been made public.The military has long been aware of small numbers of white supremacists and other extremists among the troops. But Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and other leaders launched a broader campaign to root out extremism in the force after it became clear that military veterans and some current service members were present at the Jan. 6 insurrection.The risk of extremism in the military can be more dangerous because many service members have access to classified information about sensitive military operations or other national security information that could help adversaries. And extremist groups routinely recruit former and current service members because of their familiarity with weapons and combat tactics.Officials said that while the substantiated cases may be small, compared to the size of the military, which includes more than 2 million active duty and reserve troops. The number appears to be an increase over previous years where the totals were in the low two-digits. But they also noted that data has not been consistent so it is difficult to identify trends.The new rules do not provide a list of extremist organizations. Instead, it is up to commanders to determine if a service member is actively conducting extremist activities based on the definitions, rather than on a list of groups that may be constantly changing, officials said.The regulations lay out six broad groups of extremist activities, and then provide 14 different definitions that constitute active participation.Soon after taking office, Austin ordered military leaders to schedule a so-called “stand-down” day and spend time talking to their troops about extremism in the ranks.The new rules apply to all of the military services, including the Coast Guard, which in peacetime is part of the Department of Homeland Security. They were developed through recommendations from the Countering Extremist Activities Working Group. And they make the distinction, for example, that troops may possess extremist materials, but they can’t attempt to distribute them, and while they can observe an extremist rally, they can’t participate, fund or support one.The rules, said the officials, focus on behavior not ideology. So service members have whatever political, religious or other beliefs that they want, but their actions and behavior are governed.In addition to the new rules, the Pentagon is expanding its screening for recruits to include a deeper look at potential extremist activities. Some activities may not totally prevent someone from joining the military, but require a closer look at the applicant.The department also is expanding education and training for current military members, and more specifically for those leaving the service who may be suddenly subject to recruitment by extremist organizations.More than 650 people have been charged in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, including dozens of veterans and about a half dozen active duty service members. Among them — an Army reservist who wore a Hitler mustache to his job at a Navy base.Some of the rioters facing the most serious charges, including members of far-right extremist groups, have military backgrounds. In several of the prosecution cases already, the Justice Department has cited a rioter’s military service as a factor weighing in favor of a jail sentence or house arrest. Prosecutors have repeatedly maintained that veterans’ service, while commendable, made their actions on Jan. 6 more egregious.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-issues-rules-aimed-at-stopping-rise-of-extremism-101640024377459.html
20-12-2021||World||Wall Street falls on Omicron worries, Biden investment bill blow||US stock indexes fell more than 1% on Monday, dragged down by concerns about the impact of tighter Covid-19 curbs on the global economy, and a potentially devastating setback to President Joe Biden's investment bill.Surging global infections of the Omicron coronavirus variant have sparked worries in financial markets as many European nations and Britain weigh the possibility of restrictions during Christmas."Typically what happens in Europe is a bit of a preview for what we see in the United States. So, if we see a lot more infections in the US, it could stress hospitals, make people less reluctant to get out, spend, and partake in the economy. That's definitely a cause of concern," said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.All of the 11 major S&P 500 sector indexes fell, with energy tumbling 2.4% as oil prices slumped by about $3.Technology, communication services and consumer discretionary, the sectors which house majority of mega-cap growth stocks, extended their slide from the previous session.Denting the market's sentiment further, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin said on Sunday he would not support Biden's $1.75 trillion domestic investment bill.Goldman Sachs trimmed its quarterly U.S. GDP forecasts for 2022 after Manchin's comments.The developments come at a time when the Federal Reserve decided last week to end its pandemic-era stimulus faster, with the central bank signaling at least three quarter-percentage-point interest rate hikes by the end of 2022."So we could be seeing a little bit of downward pressure on growth forecasts for next year and as a result, we may be seeing some of that reverberate through the market as well," said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management."To some extent, they'll (lawmakers) probably go back to the table and try and figure out some parts of this plan that they may like to pass going forward, but in this current form, it doesn't seem like something that's going to happen at this point."Investors have taken a more defensive stance this month, with S&P 500 sectors such as consumer staples, real estate and utilities leading sectoral gains so far in December.The CBOE Volatility index, a gauge for investor anxiety, gained over 4 points and rose to its highest level in two weeks on Monday.At 12:00 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 618.07 points, or 1.75%, at 34,747.37, the S&P 500 was down 74.89 points, or 1.62%, at 4,545.75 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 245.91 points, or 1.62%, at 14,923.77.Oracle Corp fell 4.1% after the enterprise software maker said it would buy electronic medical records company Cerner Corp for $28.3 billion. Shares of Cerner added 1.0%.Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 5.89-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 3.66-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&P index recorded two new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 10 new highs and 280 new lows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wall-street-falls-on-omicron-worries-biden-investment-bill-blow-101640022424389.html
20-12-2021||World||India, China ‘effectively managed’ border frictions: Chinese FM Wang Yi||China and India have maintained communication through diplomatic and military channels to control friction at the border, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi said on Monday amid a dragging conflict along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh that has seen bilateral ties plunge to its worst in decades.“China and India have maintained dialogue through diplomatic and military channels, and effectively managed and controlled frictions in certain border areas, under a shared commitment to improving and developing the bilateral relations,” Wang said.Wang was speaking on China’s Diplomacy in 2021: Embracing a Global Vision and Serving the Nation and its People at a symposium on the international situation and China’s foreign relations.Wang referred to India only once in his lengthy speech in which he talked about China’s global diplomacy, focusing on Beijing’s ties with different countries and continents.The senior Chinese diplomat has spoken earlier about the need for India and China to partner each other and respect each other’s core interests.Beijing, however, has continued to blame India for the current military tension and not explained why the last round of military talks in October, or for that matter, a round of diplomatic negotiations the following month, failed to make any headway.In November, India and China emerged from the last round of diplomatic talks on the border standoff with little to show but an agreement on holding the next discussions between senior military commanders at an early date.In fact, the virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs was held against the backdrop of growing evidence of China building infrastructure and villages in disputed sections of the LAC and a lack of forward movement on disengagement at friction points such as Hot Springs and Depsang.Earlier this month, Wang spoke about Sino-India ties during an online talk with India’s outgoing ambassador Vikram Misri.Wang told Misri about building “mutual trust”.“When we build mutual trust, even the Himalayas cannot stop us from friendly exchanges. Without mutual trust, it is difficult to bring the two sides together, even if there are no mountains in the way. China and India should become partners and friends,” Wang said during the interaction.The narrative from New Delhi says it’s that very “mutual trust” that Beijing doesn’t seem keen to build.While China blames India for the border troubles, India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the LAC in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas.Indian and Chinese militaries have been locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh since May 2020, when a violent clash in Pangong lake area led to both sides gradually deploying tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry along the border. Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.Soldiers were killed on both sides in a brutal fight on the night of June 15 at Galwan Valley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-china-effectively-managed-border-frictions-chinese-fm-wang-yi-101640023228616.html
20-12-2021||World||‘We may have to go further’: UK PM Johnson warns as Omicron spreads||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday that he was looking at all kinds of things to keep the Omicron variant under control as the situation was extremely difficult, cautioning that further restrictions might be needed."I have to say to the British public, and I say to everybody, we will not exclude the possibility of going further if we have to do things to protect the public," Johnson said after a cabinet meeting."We will have to reserve the possibility of taking further action to protect the public."Asked about speculation that the government would ban indoor socialising and limit tourism, Johnson said:"I can certainly say we're looking at all kinds of things... to keep Omicron under control and we will rule nothing out," Johnson said.Johnson said the situation was "extremely difficult" and that hospitalisations were rising steeply in London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-may-have-to-go-further-uk-pm-johnson-warns-as-omicron-spreads-101640021205365.html
20-12-2021||World||Several countries shorten Covid-19 booster timelines in bid to tackle Omicron spread||A growing number of countries are reducing the wait time for Covid-19 vaccine boosters from six months to as few as three in a bid to ward off a new surge in infections from the Omicron variant.They are reacting to early evidence suggesting that Omicron is spreading faster than its predecessor, Delta, and is more likely to infect people who were vaccinated or had Covid in the past. Some scientists, however, say that giving boosters too soon could compromise the level of longer-term vaccine protection.While data remains limited, half a dozen laboratory studies have shown that an initial course of Covid-19 vaccines - typically given in two doses - is not enough to halt infection from the Omicron variant, but a booster shot may help.Research from southern Africa and the UK shows that the variant is spreading very quickly, prompting forecasts that it will soon outpace Delta in several countries. Scientists are also trying to determine how severe cases of Omicron are.Many countries, including the United States, earlier this year authorized booster doses at six months after a person completes vaccination. This month, South Korea, the United Kingdom and Thailand cut that interval to three months. Belgium has lowered it to four months.France, Singapore, Taiwan, Italy and Australia have decreased their booster wait time to five months.Some countries, including the United States, South Africa and Germany, have stuck to the six-month booster schedule.Finland has recommended a three-month booster timeline for at-risk groups, saying it does not believe shortening the time for the general population will slow rising hospitalizations.Spain and Lithuania are also so far offering boosters only to people with weak immune systems, the elderly or vulnerable, while India has not decided on a booster campaign. The World Health Organization, which had told rich countries to prioritize sending first Covid vaccine doses to the developing world, has become more open to boosters in light of rising cases.More data is needed, but there is a risk that shorter timeframes could compromise the effectiveness of vaccines given in multiple doses, experts said."In general for multiple-dose vaccines ... the immune system works better if it has time to mature," said Dr. William Schaffner, infectious disease expert from the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.Immune system defensesWhile studies show that boosters temporarily increase antibody levels, scientists say the goal of a vaccine regimen is to elicit not only antibodies but second-line immune system defenses such as T-cells."All that is going to be helpful for keeping you out of the hospital," said Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert at Baylor College of Medicine.Multi-dose vaccines prime the immune system, giving it time to marshal those back-up defenses.Dr. Luciano Borio, a former Food and Drug Administration acting chief scientist, said, "I do worry that we don't know what impact it may have on the immune system maturation of the doses. Three months seems like a very short interval."The United States has no plans to change its current booster timing recommendations, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said in an email."From an immunologic point of view, it does not make sense to shorten the intervals to less than six months," said a spokesperson for Arkansas' public health department.Still, some experts argue that the six-month interval was arbitrary, and data gathered prior to the rise of the Omicron variant in November has shown that immunity as measured by antibody levels begins to drop off as early as four months after initial Covid-19 vaccinations."Four months is when the waning really started to get substantial," said Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California. "Omicron just forces the issue."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/several-countries-shorten-covid-19-booster-timelines-in-bid-to-tackle-omicron-spread-101640020487329.html
20-12-2021||World||China drafts new sexual harassment legislation for women||China's top lawmaking body on Monday debated legislation to give women more protection against gender discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace, state media reported, outlining rules including a clearer definition of inappropriate behaviour.The standing committee of the country's parliament, the National People's Congress, deliberated a draft amendment to the "Women's Rights and Interests Protection Law," state television network CCTV reported.The move came as China explores ways to maintain the labour force while its population is set to shrink, and after activist calls for gender equality that have accompanied a fledging #MeToo movement.China ranks 107th among 153 countries in the World Economic Forum's annual ranking on global gender equality. Men dominate top echelons of politics and business. Women made up roughly one-quarter of the parliament and there is just one woman in the 25-member Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party.Under the new rules, employers would not be allowed to ask female job applicants if they intend to get married or pregnant, or to make them take pregnancy tests, CCTV said.CCTV is part of the Chinese government's publicity department and is an official channel in which the party and government releases information. The department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the proposed legislation.It was not clear how quickly the legislation could be passed. The discussion is expected to continue until at least Friday and the draft would not likely be voted on before that.Under the new rules, employers would be breaking the law if they restrict female staff from getting married or having children, or if they explicitly prioritise male candidates over females.In the clearest definition yet of sexual harassment in China, the draft amendment stipulates that it is unlawful to subject women against their will to verbal expressions with sexual connotations, inappropriate or unnecessary bodily behaviour, sexually explicit images, or hint at benefits in exchange for intimate relationships or sex.China's #MeToo movement took off in 2018 when a college student in Beijing publicly accused her professor of sexual harassment. It spread to NGOs, media and other industries but faced a recent setback when a court in September ruled against the plaintiff in a high-profile sexual harassment case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-drafts-new-sexual-harassment-legislation-for-women-101640017578844.html
20-12-2021||World||Covid-19: WHO says Omicron spreading faster than Delta, infecting those vaccinated||The Omicron variant of the coronavirus is spreading faster than the Delta variant and is causing infections in people already vaccinated or who have recovered from the COVID-19 disease, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday."There is now consistent evidence that Omicron is spreading significantly faster than the Delta variant," WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news briefing for Geneva-based journalists, held at its new headquarters building."And it is more likely people vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19 could be infected or re-infected," Tedros said.WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said that the variant was successfully evading some immune responses, meaning that the booster programmes being rolled out in many countries ought to be targeted towards people with weaker immune systems.Omicron appears to be better at evading antibodies generated by some COVID-19 vaccines but there are other forms of immunity that may prevent infection and disease, WHO officials said."We do not believe that all vaccines will become completely ineffective," Swaminathan said.WHO expert Abdi Mahamud added: "Although we are seeing a reduction in the neutralisation antibodies, almost all data shows T-cells remain intact, that is what we really require."While the antibody defences from some courses have been undermined, there been hope that T-cells, the second pillar of an immune response, can prevent severe disease by attacking infected human cells.Swaminathan, referring to a treatment for people with the disease, said: "Of course there is a challenge, many of the monoclonals will not work with Omicron." She gave no details.But the WHO team also offered some hope to a world facing the new wave that 2022 would be the year that the pandemic, which already killed more than 5.6 million people worldwide, would end - with the development of second and third generation vaccines, further development of antimicrobial treatments and other innovations."(We) hope to consign this disease of a relatively mild disease that is easily prevented, that is easily treated ...and that able to cope easily with this disease into the future," Mike Ryan, the WHO's top emergency expert, told the briefing."If we can keep virus transmission to minimum, then can bring pandemic to end."However Tedros also said China, where the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was first detected at the end of 2019, must be forthcoming with data and information related to its origin to help the response going forward."We need to continue until we know the origins, we need to push harder because we should learn from what happened this time in order to (do) better in the future," Tedros said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-who-says-omicron-spreading-faster-than-delta-infecting-those-vaccinated-101640017895516.html

It includes a focus on whether the Trump Organization overstated the value of some real estate assets to obtain loans and tax benefits.In July, the company and longtime Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in what a prosecutor in Vance's office called a "sweeping and audacious" 15-year tax fraud.In Monday's lawsuit, Trump and the company claim that James, a Democrat, is motivated by partisan bias against Trump, a Republican, pointing to public statements she made against the former president before she was elected to her position.They are seeking a court order barring the investigation from going forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-sues-nyc-attorney-general-letitia-james-to-stop-probe-of-his-businesses-101640016490180.html

It stated that the extension of Covaxin’s shelf life up to 12 months from the date of manufacturing was recently approved by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO).The issue of vaccine wastage is a major concern for companies as well as the health authorities since the demand has been not able to keep up pace with the supply. The latest announcement could help resolve the vaccine wastage issue to some extent, especially the vaccines nearing expiry. The Hyderabad-based vaccine maker said that Covaxin has been approved for use under the 28-day multi-dose vial policy from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and the WHO Emergency Use Listing.“This approval of shelf life is based on the availability of additional stability data, which was submitted to CSCO,” Bharat Biotech said, adding that the hospitals can now utilise the stock which was nearing the expiry and avoid vaccine wastage.The company said the multidose vial policy would save money for procurement agencies by reducing the cold chain logistics and management and subsequently reducing the carbon footprint and costs related to open vial wastage.“Most importantly, we believe in being environmentally friendly by reducing the quantum of packing materials and single-use plastics that are utilized in vaccines manufacturing, storage, distribution, and disposal,” it added.Earlier today, Bharat Biotech said it has submitted an application to the DCGI to conduct a phase 3 clinical trial for a booster dose of its intranasal Covid-19 vaccine."We have submitted phase 3 clinical trial application to DCGI," Reuters quoted a Bharat Biotech spokesperson as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/opened-vials-of-covaxin-can-be-stored-for-up-to-28-days-bharat-biotech-101640011900541.html
20-12-2021||World||Novavax Covid jab gets EU medicine regulator's approval||Europe's medicines watchdog on Monday approved a Covid jab by US-based Novavax, which uses a more conventional technology that the biotech firm hopes will reduce vaccine hesitancy.The protein-based vaccine of the kind used around the world to protect against many childhood illnesses is the fifth coronavirus shot authorised for use in the European Union."EMA has recommended granting a conditional marketing authorisation for Novavax's Covid-19 vaccine Nuvaxovid to prevent Covid-19 in people from 18 years of age," the European Medicines Agency said in a statement."After a thorough evaluation, EMA's human medicines committee concluded by consensus that the data on the vaccine were robust and met the EU criteria for efficacy, safety and quality," the Amsterdam-based agency said.Two main clinical trials -- one in Britain and the other in the US and Mexico and involving more than 45,000 people in total, showed between 89-90 percent efficacy in reducing the number of symptomatic Covid cases, the EMA said.But the watchdog said the clinical studies involved the original Covid-19 strain and some variants of concern such as Alpha and Beta, which were "the most common viral strains circulating when the studies were ongoing.""There is currently limited data on the efficacy of Nuvaxovid against other variants of concern, including Omicron," it said.'Well-understood platform'Monday's approval is also a boost for the Maryland company, whose jab has been plagued by delays.The EU has already signed a deal to buy up to 200 million doses of the two-shot vaccine pending the EMA's approval.Chief executive Stanley Erck said the firm "looks forward to providing an additional vaccine option in Europe, built on a proven, well-understood technology platform".The vaccine "may help address major obstacles to global vaccination, including global distribution challenges and vaccine hesitancy," Erck added.All vaccines work by teaching the body's immune system to attack the coronavirus, but they do it in different ways.Novavax's so-called protein subunit technology is already tried and tested, having been used for decades to vaccinate people against diseases including hepatitis B and whooping cough.It also means it does not have to be stored in ultra-low temperatures, potentially giving it a logistical edge over some other jabs.'Production problems'Novavax uses tiny, lab-made fragments of a protein found on the surface of the coronavirus spike.When injected, these trigger a reaction by the immune system, so that if it later comes into contact with the Covid virus, it knows to attack it.By contrast, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have dominated the global Covid response using pioneering, but hitherto largely untested Messenger RNA (mRNA) technology.They use a molecule of genetic material known as RNA to deliver a message to cells to produce the spike protein themselves. The body's immune system then learns to recognise the protein and attack it.The viral vector approach used by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson works on a similar principle, but delivers the genetic message via a version of the common cold adenovirus as a "vector".Rare but serious side effects of heart inflammation have been reported with the mRNA vaccines, and blood clots with the viral vector vaccines.But Novavax has struggled with months of delays amid what a group of MEPs recently called "production problems".Indonesia and the Philippines have already approved the Novavax jab, while Japan has agreed to buy 150 million doses.Novavax says it has also filed for approval in Britain, India, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and with the World Health Organization.The company has also said it is "evaluating its vaccine against the Omicron variant" and working on an Omicron-specific version.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novavax-covid-jab-gets-eu-medicine-regulator-s-approval-101640010174751.html
20-12-2021||World||Egypt suspends classes, ports due to stormy weather||Stormy weather has prompted Egyptian authorities to suspend classes Monday in the capital of Cairo and a handful of other provinces as a precautionary measure.Authorities also closed the ports in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria and the Suez Canal cities of Port Said and Suez.The country’s meteorological agency said moderate to heavy rainfall is expected over the northern coast and the Nile Delta region. The agency also said dusty storms are expected to hit northern and southern parts of country, and limit visibility.The Environment Ministry also urged old people and those suffering from chest and respiratory diseases to stay at home Monday to avoid weather-related complications.The Health Ministry said it deployed more ambulance crews in remote areas and on highways as a precautionary measure in case of road accidents.Moderate rains overnight have partly flooded streets in some neighborhoods in Cairo and other parts of the country. Local media reported snowfall over Alexandria, partly covering roads and rooftops across the coastal city.People took to social media platforms posting images and videos mostly celebrating the rare snowfall over the city. An Arabic hashtag, #Alexandria, was trending Monday.“Alexandria has become like Moscow. Good Winter!” wrote Menna Bader in a tweet, referring to Russian capital known with its icy weather.The seasonal rainfall has raised questions about the country’s ability to deal with flooding which usually leaves parts of Cairo and other major cities impassable. Flooding and heavy rain were also deadly in previous years, especially in rural areas.Infrastructure, sewage and drainage systems have all suffered from a lack of investment and years of poor maintenance. Scenes of trucks fanning out to drain water from flooded areas have been common in recent years.Last month heavy rain and flooding forced scorpions from their hiding places into many houses across the southern province of Aswan. State-run media reported at the time that three people were dead and over 500 others hospitalized from scorpion stings in Aswan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-suspends-classes-ports-due-to-stormy-weather-101640008964720.html
20-12-2021||World||Giant rave in Saudi desert pushes kingdom’s changing boundaries||The party in the Saudi desert looked like any other rave until the music stopped for the Islamic call to prayer, leaving attendees in ripped skinny jeans and combat boots to stand in silence.Fifteen minutes later -- religious duties completed -- thousands of party-goers got back to business. Men and women danced with abandon in a country where that would have been unthinkable five years ago.The electronic music festival in Saudi Arabia this weekend highlighted the changes catapulting through the conservative kingdom under its controversial crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. In just a few years, the prince has lifted a ban on women driving, loosened gender segregation and defanged the religious police, who used to roam the streets punishing restaurants that played music.In contrast, the four-day festival called MDL Beast Soundstorm was endorsed by the government and included performances by global DJs like Tiësto and Armin van Buuren. Organizers say more than 180,000 people attended the opening night, pushing boundaries as the kingdom transforms.“Allow us progress, allow us to represent ourselves in the way that we feel fit,” said Prince Fahad Al Saud, a royal family member and entrepreneur who attended in a psychedelic-patterned jacket and sparkling eyeliner. “We are very eager to be part of the international community, but we can’t be stifled every time we try to make progress because it doesn’t look like what you want to see.”Busy monthIndeed, the festival was part of a dizzying month in which Saudi Arabia hosted a Formula One race, two separate art biennials and a visit by French President Emmanuel Macron. All of it underlined the fact that any ostracism on the world stage has largely passed for Prince Mohammed, who faced global outcry after the 2018 murder of government critic Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul.The prince’s plans to diversify the oil-dependent economy call for developing new sectors such as entertainment and tourism. And after closing the kingdom’s borders during much of the coronavirus pandemic, officials seem eager to make up for lost time -- even as the omicron variant of the virus drives case surges in other countries.At a recent international film festival in Jeddah, women strutted the red carpet in sleeveless gowns and an openly queer man, Adam Ali, won best actor. British supermodel Naomi Campbell was photographed sitting on the floor in front of a traditional Saudi meal, eating with her hands.“Now everything is here and the world has come to us,” marveled Abdullah Alghamdi, 29, who attended the weekend rave. “There are honestly so many events that you don’t know where to go.”Queer cultureThe scenes at the music festival were the most extreme of any yet. Women flaunted their style, wearing everything from skintight pants to full-length robes and face veils. Inebriated men stumbled through crowds perfumed with the distinct scent of marijuana, alongside a limited but notable display of local queer culture. Alcohol and homosexuality are still illegal in Saudi Arabia, but the event created a carnival-like atmosphere, opening the space to test limits.Any critical voices were largely silent. Under Prince Mohammed, Saudi Arabia’s social opening has come with a crackdown on domestic dissent. Driving that fact home, officials closed every other large-scale event in Riyadh “for maintenance” for the duration of the festival, sparking sardonic jokes about the government forcing people to attend.But to Ibrahim Fahad, a 21-year-old tourism and hospitality student, the festival was a long-awaited dream.“I can’t even describe my feelings,” he said, posing for pictures as bass pounded in the background. “Before music opened up in Saudi Arabia, I used to travel to see artists like The Chainsmokers. Now I can stay at home, because they’re here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/giant-rave-in-saudi-desert-pushes-kingdom-s-changing-boundaries-101640008353132.html
20-12-2021||World||Philippines typhoon death toll hits 375||The death toll from the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines this year surged to 375 on Monday, as desperate survivors pleaded for urgent supplies of drinking water and food.The Philippine Red Cross reported "complete carnage" in coastal areas after Super Typhoon Rai left homes, hospitals and schools "ripped to shreds".The storm tore off roofs, uprooted trees, toppled concrete power poles, smashed wooden houses to pieces, wiped out crops and flooded villages -- sparking comparisons to the damage caused by Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013."Our situation is so desperate," said Ferry Asuncion, a street vendor in the hard-hit seaside city of Surigao, which was devastated by the storm.Residents urgently needed "drinking water and food", he said.At least 375 people were killed and 56 are missing in the latest disaster to hit the archipelago, with 500 more injured, the national police said.More than 380,000 people fled their homes and beachfront resorts as Rai slammed into the country on Thursday.One of the hardest-hit islands was Bohol -- known for its beaches, "Chocolate Hills" and tiny tarsier primates -- where at least 94 people have died, provincial Governor Arthur Yap said on Facebook.In Bohol's coastal town of Ubay, a state of calamity has been declared, with many wooden houses flattened and fishing boats destroyed.A senior official at the national disaster agency said he had not expected as many deaths."I was proven wrong as it appears now coming from the reports," said Casiano Monilla, deputy administrator for operations.- 'SOS' -Rai hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season: most cyclones develop between July and October.Scientists have long warned that typhoons are becoming more powerful and strengthening more rapidly as the world becomes warmer because of human-driven climate change.The Philippines -- ranked among the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change -- is hit by an average of 20 storms every year, which typically wipe out harvests, homes and infrastructure in already impoverished areas.In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan was the strongest storm ever to have made landfall, leaving over 7,300 people dead or missing.The death toll from Rai is not expected to get anywhere close to that number.The Philippines has an established disaster management system that provides early warnings of approaching storms and moves vulnerable communities into evacuation centres.But the storm has dealt a savage blow to the tourism sector, which was already struggling after Covid-19 restrictions decimated visitor numbers."SOS" has been painted on a road in the tourist town of General Luna on Siargao Island, where surfers and holidaymakers had flocked ahead of Christmas, as people struggled to find water and food."There's no water anymore, there's a water shortage, on day one there was already looting in our neighbourhood," Siargao resort owner Marja O'Donnell told CNN Philippines.There has also been widespread destruction on Dinagat and Mindanao islands, which along with Siargao bore the brunt of the storm when it hit, packing wind speeds of 195 kilometres (120 miles) per hour.Police reported 167 deaths in the Caraga region, which includes Dinagat, Siargao and the northeastern part of Mindanao.At least 14 people died on the Dinagat Islands, provincial information officer Jeffrey Crisostomo told broadcaster ABS-CBN, saying the area had been "levelled to the ground".But letters written by Dinagat residents, and posted to Facebook, expressed hope."We are happy to be alive," Aimee Antonio-Jimeno wrote to her sister."Our houses are roofless but we are not hopeless!"With electricity knocked out in many areas, there is no signal or internet, hampering efforts to assess the storm's damage.Thousands of military, police, coast guard and fire personnel were deployed along with food, water and medical supplies, while heavy machinery -- including backhoes and front-end loaders -- were sent to clear roads.President Rodrigo Duterte vowed to "look for another" two billion pesos ($40 million) in aid, which would double his previous pledge.But some expressed frustration at the government's response."No one showed up -- I don't know where the politicians and (election) candidates are," said a visibly angry Levi Lisondra, a resident in Surigao, on the northern tip of Mindanao."We paid big taxes when we were working and now they can't help us."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-typhoon-death-toll-hits-375-101640004007457.html
20-12-2021||World||Christmas lockdown after 12 Omicron deaths? Here's what UK deputy PM has to say||Britain’s deputy prime minister Dominic Raab on Monday said 12 people infected with the Omicron variant of coronavirus have died in the United Kingdom, refusing to rule out further restrictions before Christmas. The rapid spread of the Omicron variant ahead of the festival has put the British government in a spot amid reports of a possible two-week circuit-breaker lockdown.Health experts have also started to play down the initial argument of “mild” disease from Omicron as compared to the Delta variant given the worrying rate of transmission which could overwhelm the health system. The United Kingdom has been recorded over 37,000 confirmed cases of Omicron, with a majority of cases detected in the last two days.With record levels of Covid cases in Britain, officials have warned that the full effect of the latest wave is yet to be seen. While the severity of the disease caused by the new variant of concern remains unclear, 12 deaths related to Omicron may push the government to opt for stricter measures in the coming days. As many as 104 Covid patients are currently in hospital with Omicron, said Raab.When asked about whether the government would impose further restrictions before Christmas, the deputy PM told Times Radio, "I just can't make hard and fast guarantees.""In assessing the situation we rely very heavily on the real data coming through and it will take a little bit more time to assess this critical issue of the severity of Omicron."Last week, British media reported on a meeting held by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) which recommended measures ranging from "mild guidance to nudge people, right through to lockdown.""If the aim is to reduce the levels of infection in the population and prevent hospitalisations reaching these levels, more stringent measures would need to be implemented very soon," the Sage minutes said, as quoted by BBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/christmas-lockdown-after-12-omicron-deaths-here-s-what-uk-deputy-pm-have-to-say-101640002344427.html

20-12-2021||World||Israel extends travel ban to US, Canada, 8 other countries as Omicron rages||The Israeli Cabinet has approved the recommendations by health officials to extend the travel ban to 10 more countries, including the United States and Canada, due to the spread of the Omicron variant. The decision was announced by Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett office following a Cabinet vote on Monday.The rare move of banning travel to the United States comes amid a rapid spread of the new variant of concern across the globe and a rise in infections in Israel, a country with high vaccination coverage. The travel ban is expected to take effect from Wednesday midnight once the parliamentary committee gives the decision a final approval.The US and Canada will join several European countries and other destinations on the so-called travel red-list to which Israelis would be barred from travelling and incoming travellers must remain in quarantine for a stipulated time period.Here’s the list of countries Israel will extend its travel ban:The travel restrictions come amid growing concern over the transmission rate of the Omicron variant which has now spread to at least 89 countries within a month of its identification by South African and Botswanan scientists in November. Top health experts, including White House medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci, has sounded alarm bells about the variant of concern raging through the world.“I don’t foresee the kind of lockdowns that we’ve seen before but I certainly see the potential for stress on our hospital system,” Fauci said in an interview with ABC’s “This Week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-to-extend-travel-ban-to-us-canada-8-other-countries-as-omicron-rages-101639991567127.html
20-12-2021||World||Chinese banks cut borrowing costs to counter economic slowdown||Chinese banks lowered borrowing costs for the first time in 20 months, foreshadowing more monetary support to an economy showing strain from a property slump, weak private consumption and sporadic virus outbreaks.The one-year loan prime rate was set at 3.8% versus 3.85% in November, the first reduction since April 2020, according to a statement from the People’s Bank of China on Monday. The five-year loan prime rate, a reference for mortgages, was unchanged at 4.65%.The cut comes as the central bank and government increase support for the economy and follows the PBOC’s decision earlier this month to cut the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve, which freed up 1.2 trillion yuan ($188 billion) of cheap long-term funding for banks. Monday’s decision means the strongest companies will be able to borrow at a slightly cheaper rate and also reinforces the shift to looser policy as the leadership aims for stability in 2022. “The cut reinforces our view that China’s authorities are increasingly open to the possibility of an interest-rate cut amid looming headwinds to the economy,” said Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. While technically not a policy interest rate, the LPR is based on 18 banks’ loan rates for their best customers and has been considered China’s de facto benchmark funding cost since 2019. The cut will lower overall interest payment burden of Chinese companies by 80 billion yuan per year starting next year, according to Xing, who said there are around 160 trillion yuan of loans pegged to the one-year LPR. The CSI 300 Real Estate Index climbed as much as 2.6%. Gemdale Corp. and Poly Developments and Holdings Group Co. led the gains, each rising at least 3.5%. China’s 10-year note yield was little changed at 2.85%, while the offshore yuan steadied at 6.3865 to the dollar.The move strengthens the easing bias of the PBOC, and more measures could be rolled out if the economic slowdown deepens, including further cuts to the reserve requirement ratio as well as reduction of policy rates, according to analysts. The PBOC vowed last week to continue to unleash the potential of interest rate reforms and guide overall corporate financing costs lower.“The signal is obvious that we are in an easing cycle,” said He Wei, an analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, who expects the PBOC’s policy rates, or the rates for the medium-term lending facility and seven-day reverse repurchase notes, will be lowered in the first half of next year.In another sign of support, China will focus on supporting “quality” property developers buying the real estate projects of large companies which are experiencing difficulties, Financial News, a newspaper co-founded by the PBOC, reported Monday, citing a notice from the central bank and the banking regulator.Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance Securities Hong Kong Ltd., said the next window for monetary easing could be late January, when the PBOC may act to cut the RRR, policy rates or roll out more structural tools depending on the economy’s state as well previous policies’ impact.“In the near term we may not see PBOC adding more measure,” said Qi Gao, a strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia. The PBOC could cut the MLF rate next year and lower the RRR again in the first half of 2022, he said.Xing of ANZ echoed the view that the LPR reduction signals there may not be policy rate cut in the short term, but forecast another RRR cut early next year to cushion mounting credit risks in the property sector.The LPR is reported by banks in the form of a spread over the interest rate on PBOC’s medium-term loans. With the PBOC having kept the MLF rate unchanged last week, most economists polled by Bloomberg had expected the LPR to remain steady as well.Still, the chorus for a rate cut has grown louder recently, and interest rate swaps also showed traders had been betting the LPR would soon be cut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-banks-cut-borrowing-costs-to-counter-economic-slowdown-101639988946856.html

He is currently planning a trip to the moon.Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa returned to Earth on Monday after spending 12 days on board the International Space Station, Russia's space agency Roscosmos said.Maezawa is a fashion tycoon who sold his online fashion business Zozo to SoftBank in 2019. Forbes estimates his worth as $1.9 (€1.69) billion.What was the trip like?Maezawa parachuted onto Kazakhstan's steppe at around the planned time of 0313 GMT, along with his assistant and film producer Yozo Hirano, and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin.The landing site was located 150 kilometers southeast of Zhezkazgan in central Kazakhstan, where there was precipitation and sub-zero temperatures.Maezawa made the trip in a Russian 'Soyuz' spacecraft and became the first space tourist to travel to the International Space Station in more than a decade.The entrepreneur made a variety of posts on social media from his trip, including photos from space of his home prefecture of Chiba, and videos showing how to make tea in zero gravity and discussing his shortage of fresh underwear.What did Maezawa say about the trip?In a live interview from the orbiting space station, Maezawa said that "once you are in space, you realize how much it is worth it by having this amazing experience."When asked about claims that he had paid more than $80 million (€71 million) for the trip, Maezawa said he couldn't disclose the exact sum but admitted that he paid "pretty much" that much.Maezawa is currently searching for eight people to join him on a trip to the moon in 2023.

20-12-2021||World||China tennis star Peng Shuai denies sexual assault claim||Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai on Sunday said she has never been sexually assaulted by anyone, retracting a social media claim made in November where she said a former top Communist Party of China (CPC) had forced her into sex.Peng, speaking to the Chinese language Singaporean newspaper, Lianhe Zaobao, in Shanghai, said she was living at her home in Beijing and was not under any kind of official supervision.Sunday’s short interview to Zaobao on the sidelines of a sports event in Shanghai was the first time Peng directly spoke to the media after dropping out of sight following her allegation that former CPC politburo standing committee member and vice-premier Zhang Gaoli had sexually assaulted her.Peng had posted the allegation on her verified Twitter-like Weibo account.On Sunday, however, Peng denied her own allegation. “First of all, I want to emphasise something that is very important. I have never said that I wrote that anyone sexually assaulted me. I need to emphasise this point very clearly,” Peng said, according to a translation of what she told the newspaper reporter in Chinese.Asked about the allegations made on Weibo, Peng Shuai said: “First, I would like to stress a very important point: I have never said nor written anything accusing anyone of sexually assaulting me. I would like to emphasise this point very clearly.”She added: “Regarding Weibo, first of all, it’s a matter related to my personal privacy. Everyone has had many misunderstandings. Their misreadings do not stand.”According to a report by another Singapore newspaper, the Straits Times, when asked if she was under surveillance following the matter, she replied after a brief hesitation: “Why would that be the case? I have always been very free.”Peng Shuai added that an e-mail she had sent to the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) head Steve Simon in November assuring him that she was safe was legitimate.Peng said she wrote the Chinese version of the e-mail “entirely of my own free will” but that state media’s English channel CGTN had published a translated version of it in English as her own standard of the English language was not up to par. “What was conveyed (by CGTN) was no different from what I meant to convey to Mr Simon,” she added.Her #MeToo allegation against Zhang had sparked an online firestorm and swift censorship in China in the first week of November.Peng, a former Chinese world number one in doubles tennis, had accused former Zhang, 75, of coercing her into having sex and subsequently continuing an on-and-off secret relationship with her for years.Zhang, the vice premier, was among the seven members of the CPC Politburo Standing Committee, the highest decision-making body in China, between 2013 and 2018, under President Xi Jinping.The WTA, which early this month said it would suspend tournaments in China immediately due to concerns over the treatment of Peng Shuai and the safety of other players, continued to call for an investigation. “It was again good to see Peng Shuai in a public setting and we certainly hope she is doing well,” it said in a statement.“As we have consistently stated, these appearances do not alleviate or address the WTA’s significant concerns about her well-being and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion,” the WTA said.“We remain steadfast in our call for a full, fair and transparent investigation, without censorship, into her allegation of sexual assault, which is the issue that gave rise to our initial concern.”China has not directly commented on Peng’s initial post, but said after the WTA’s move to suspend tournaments in China that it “opposes the politicisation of sports”.Zhang has not commented on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tennis-star-peng-shuai-denies-sexual-assault-claim-101639980146049.html
20-12-2021||World||Elon Musk says he will pay over $11 billion in taxes this year||Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., said on Twitter that he’ll pay more than $11 billion in taxes this year, an amount that could constitute a record payment to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.The billionaire may face a tax bill of more than $10 billion for 2021 if he exercises all his options due to expire next year, calculations last week by Bloomberg News showed.The unusually high levy comes after Musk exercised almost 15 million options and sold millions of shares to cover the taxes related to those transactions. That was following a Twitter poll last month when he asked followers whether he should sell 10% of his stake in the electric carmaker, whose shares have rocketed more than 2,300% over the past five years.A report by ProPublica in June said Musk paid little income tax relative to his outsize wealth. But he’s pushed back against that characterization, saying he doesn’t draw a salary from either SpaceX or Tesla, and pays an effective tax rate of 53% on stock options he exercises. He added that he expects that tax rate to increase next year.Musk earlier this month said he’ll pay more taxes than any American in history this year. That was in response to another tweet from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who used Musk’s Time Magazine “Person of the Year” accolade to call him out on his taxes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elon-musk-says-he-will-pay-over-11-billion-in-taxes-this-year-101639979660710.html
20-12-2021||World||Covid-19: These 10 countries remain untouched. Know the reason and see list||It’s been two years since the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) struck the world. It changed the definition of “normal” and affected almost every sector – be it travel, education or healthcare.The disease spread across the globe at an alarming pace, and kept mutating regularly to emerge in more dangerous and, in some cases, vaccine resistant form.The United States and Europe are among the worst affected regions, where the new Omicron variant has been wreaking havoc. More than 800,000 people have already been killed in the US, and the infections are still surging.But surprisingly, there are some countries have managed to stave off the coronavirus pandemic since it began in late 2019, reporting zero cases, according to the World Health Organization.Most of these countries and territories are islands in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and are likely to be experiencing the benefit of bordering only the sea.Some of the countries have also adopted strict travel policies, which helped them successfully keep the infections at bay. Two of them are being run under dictatorships, so getting an accurate data is very difficult.Though these countries have reported zero Covid-19 cases, that does not rule out the fact that some cases may have flown under the radar.Here’s a look at 10 countries which have not reported any Covid-19 cases till now:Tuvalu: This independent island in the South Pacific has stopped the coronavirus infections from reaching its shores. Though a member of the Commonwealth, Tuvalu successfully closed its borders to travel, with a mandatory quarantine in some cases. The group of three reef islands and six atolls has a combined area of 25 square kilometres. According to WHO, nearly 50 people are fully vaccinated per 100 population.Turkmenistan: The country has not acknowledged any case of the coronavirus disease, a stand that has irked the international community. The Central Asian country shares its borders with Uzbekistan and Afghanistan, and is largely covered by the Karakum desert; from one side, it also touches the Caspian Sea. A senior WHO official earlier told the BBC that it is highly unlikely that the virus is not circulating in Turkmenistan as the world has been grappling with it for two years.North Korea: Like Turkmenistan, the hermit kingdom has also not declared any Covid-19 cases. In fact, reports in a section of media claimed that the Kim Jong-un regime eliminated the known cases of the disease to keep the country virus free.Tokelau: The WHO has listed the tiny group of atolls in the South Pacific as free of Covid-19. Tokelau is a group if three atolls with a combined area of 10 square kilometres and population of 1,500. With no airport, the island near New Zealand is accessible primarily by ship.Saint Helena: It is a British Overseas Territory in the South Atlantic Ocean. Saint Helena is considered one of the most remote regions of the world. According to WHO, total vaccine doses administered per 100 population in Saint Helena is 138.Pitcairn Islands: These are the group of four volcanic islands in the Pacific Ocean. According to country profile on the CIA website, the population of full-time residents at 50 and most of them reside near the village of Adamstown.Niue: This island nation is one of the world’s largest coral islands, located about 2,500 kilometres from New Zealand. Niue was supported by New Zealand in its fight against Covid-19.Nauru: It is the third-smallest country in the world by size. Nauru is a neighbouring country of Kiribati. The reason why Covid-19 has not been reported in the country is the travel restriction put in place by the local administration.Kiribati: It is located more than 3,200 kilometres southwest of Hawaii.

20-12-2021||World||Typhoon Rai: Death toll in the Philippines crosses 200||The death toll from the strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines this year has surged to 208, the national police said Monday, making it one of the deadliest storms to hit the country in recent years.At least 239 people were injured and 52 were missing after Typhoon Rai ravaged the southern and central regions of the archipelago, the police tally showed.More than 300,000 people fled their homes and beachfront resorts as Rai slammed into the country on Thursday as a super typhoon.The Philippine Red Cross has reported "complete carnage" in coastal areas."Homes, hospitals, school and community buildings have been ripped to shreds," Red Cross Chairman Richard Gordon said earlier.The storm tore off roofs, uprooted trees, toppled concrete power poles, smashed wooden houses to pieces, and flooded villages -- sparking comparisons with Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.Haiyan, called Yolanda in the Philippines, was the deadliest cyclone on record in the country, leaving more than 7,300 people dead or missing.One of the hardest-hit islands this time was Bohol – known for its beaches, rolling "Chocolate Hills", and tiny tarsier primates – where at least 74 people have died, provincial Governor Arthur Yap said on his official Facebook page.There has also been widespread destruction on the Siargao, Dinagat, and Mindanao islands, which bore the brunt of the storm when it slammed into the country packing wind speeds of 195 kilometers (120 miles) per hour.At least 10 people died on the Dinagat Islands, provincial information officer Jeffrey Crisostomo told AFP on Sunday.S.O.S was painted on a road in the popular tourist town of General Luna on Siargao Island, where surfers and holidaymakers had flocked ahead of Christmas, as people struggle to find water and food.Swathes of the affected areas have no communications, hampering efforts of disaster agencies to assess the full extent of the storm's damage.Electricity also has been knocked out, affecting water-refilling stations and ATMs.Thousands of military, police, coast guard, and fire personnel have been deployed to assist in search and rescue efforts.Coast guard and naval vessels carrying food, water, and medical supplies have been dispatched, while heavy machinery -- like backhoes and front-end loaders -- have been sent to help clear roads blocked by fallen power poles and trees.Rai hit the Philippines late in the typhoon season -- most cyclones typically develop between July and October.Scientists have long warned that typhoons are becoming more powerful and strengthening more rapidly as the world becomes warmer because of human-driven climate change.The Philippines -- ranked among the globe's most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change -- is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons every year, which typically wipe out harvests, homes, and infrastructure in already impoverished areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-rai-death-toll-in-the-philippines-crosses-200-101639964533761.html
20-12-2021||World||Omicron spread: 'We are sitting ducks for next wave of Covid-19', says expert||The Omicron variant has been spreading fast, especially in the United States, which was already ravaged by the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). It is confronting another dark winter, with hospitalisations increasing 45 per cent over the last month and cases rising 40 per cent, according to a tally by news agency Reuters.Also Read | What more we know of Omicron todayAnd now, a healthcare expert has warned that people in the United States are “sitting ducks for the next wave of Covid-19”.Watch: Covid Omicron spreading 'significantly faster', says WHOAdvocating booster shots to fight Omicron, Dr Eric Topol, a cardiologist and founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, told CNBC that Americans might not be ready for the fast-spreading variant of coronavirus.“We’re lagging behind what we need to get out to the American public,” he told CNBC last week, adding that fully vaccinated should mean three shots instead of two.“We are in Omicron land now,” he said.His comments were made days before US President Joe Biden’s top medical advisor Dr Anthony Fauci said that a redefinition for what it means to be fully vaccinated is certainly on the table.“There’s no doubt that optimum vaccination is with a booster,” Dr Fauci told CNBC.On Sunday, he urged unvaccinated Americans to get a shot and the vaccinated to get boosters, which have been shown to get the protection back.He also cautioned against too much optimism over Omicron's severity, noting that in South Africa, while the hospitalisation-to-case ratio is lower than with Delta, this could be due to underlying immunity from widespread previous infections."No matter how you look at it," he underscored, "when you have so many, many infections, even if it is less severe, that overcomes this slight to moderate diminution in severity."Currently, in the United States, people are considered fully vaccinated if they have received two shots of Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, or a single dose of Jonson & Johnson vaccine.The Delta variant is still the dominant strain in the United States but Omicron is on its way to dethrone it and claim the position for itself. The heavily mutated variant has been shown in early data to have a worrying resistance to vaccines and higher transmissibility.Also Read | Threat of Omicron looms over Xmas holidays in Europe, USWhile a little more than 70 per cent of the US population has had at least one shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, another 50 million eligible people remain unprotected.Omicron now accounts for around three per cent of cases in the United States, a figure that is expected to rise rapidly as has been seen in other countries.On Saturday, New York state announced a record number of daily cases for the second day in a row, with almost 22,000 positive results.The United States crossed the 800,000 known Covid-19 deaths last Tuesday, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-spread-we-are-sitting-ducks-for-next-wave-of-covid-19-says-expert-101639958281051.html
20-12-2021||World||Pentagon documents reveal 'deeply flawed' US air war: Report||Newly obtained Pentagon documents show that the US air wars in the Middle East have been marked by "deeply flawed intelligence" and resulted in thousands of civilian deaths, including many children, the New York Times reported Saturday.It said a trove of confidential documents covering more than 1,300 reports of civilian casualties undercuts the government's portrayal of a war fought with precision bombs.Pledges of transparency and accountability, it said, had regularly fallen short."Not a single record provided includes a finding of wrongdoing or disciplinary action," the paper reported in what it said was the first of a two-part series.While several of the cases mentioned by the Times have been previously reported, it said its investigation showed that the number of civilian deaths had been "drastically undercounted," by at least several hundred.- Surveillance flaws -Among three cases cited was a July 19, 2016 bombing by US special forces of what were believed to be three Islamic State group staging areas in northern Syria. Initial reports were of 85 fighters killed. Instead, the dead were 120 farmers and other villagers.Another example was a November 2015 attack in Ramadi, Iraq after a man was seen dragging "an unknown heavy object" into an Islamic State position. The "object," a review found, was a child, who died in the strike.Poor or inadequate surveillance footage often contributed to deadly targeting failures, the report said.More recently, the United States had to retract its claim that a vehicle destroyed by a drone on a Kabul street in August had contained bombs. Victims of the strike, it turned out, were 10 members of a family, including children.Many civilian survivors of US attacks, the report says, were left with disabilities requiring expensive treatment, but condolence payments numbered fewer than a dozen.Asked for comment, Captain Bill Urban, spokesman for the US Central Command, told the Times that "even with the best technology in the world, mistakes do happen, whether based on incomplete information or misinterpretation of the information available. And we try to learn from those mistakes."We work diligently to avoid such harm. We investigate each credible instance. And we regret each loss of innocent life."- Unseen from the air -The US air campaign in the Middle East grew rapidly in the final years of former president Barack Obama's administration, as public support waned for the seemingly endless ground wars.Obama said the new approach, often using unmanned aircraft controlled from far away, represented "the most precise air campaign in history," able to keep civilian deaths to a minimum.The new technology made it possible to destroy a part of a house filled with enemy fighters while leaving the rest of the structure standing, the Pentagon said.But over a five-year period, US forces executed more than 50,000 airstrikes in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, the report said, with much less than the advertised precision.In compiling its report, the Times said its reporters had "visited more than 100 casualty sites and interviewed scores of surviving residents and current and former American officials."The paper obtained the Pentagon documents through Freedom of Information requests beginning in March 2017 and lawsuits filed against the Defense Department and the Central Command. A new suit seeks records from Afghanistan.Before launching air strikes, the military must navigate elaborate protocols to estimate and minimize civilian deaths.But there are several ways available intelligence can mislead, fall short, or at times lead to disastrous errors.For example, the Times said, video shot from the air does not show people in buildings, under foliage or under tarpaulins or aluminum covers.And available data can be misinterpreted, as when people running to a fresh bombing site are assumed to be militants, not would-be rescuers.Sometimes, the Times said, "Men on motorcycles moving 'in formation,' displaying the 'signature' of an imminent attack, were just men on motorcycles."Captain Urban, the Central Command spokesman, said air-war planners do their best under exceedingly difficult conditions.But he added that "in many combat situations, where targeteers face credible threat streams and do not have the luxury of time, the fog of war can lead to decisions that tragically result in civilian harm."bbk/bfm/st||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-documents-reveal-deeply-flawed-us-air-war-report-101639957431962.html
20-12-2021||World||Early results favor ex-protest leader for Chile's presidency||A millennial former student protest leader took an early lead Sunday in Chile's presidential runoff following a bruising campaign pitting him against a free-market firebrand likened to Donald Trump.With barely 13% of 46,887 polling stations reporting, Gabriel Boric had 53% of the votes, compared to 47% for his opponent, lawmaker José Antonio Kast.Kast, who has a history of defending Chile’s past military dictatorship, finished ahead in the first round of voting last month but failed to secure a majority of votes. That set up a head-to-head runoff against Boric, who finished two points behind.Whoever wins will be breaking precedent. Since the return of democracy three decades ago, no candidate leading after the first round has ever been defeated in the runoff. But no president has ever been elected without winning in the capital, Santiago, which Boric carried comfortably in the first round.Opinion polls in recent days consistently showed an advantage for Boric, although sometimes within the margin or error, meaning the contest is likely to be decided by whichever candidate is able to energize his base while at the same time winning over the majority of voters who don't side with political extremes.“Turnout will mean everything,” said Robert Funk, a political scientist at the University of Chile.The two candidates couldn't be more polar opposites.Kast, 55, a devout Roman Catholic and father of nine, emerged from the far right fringe after having won less than 8% of the vote in 2017. He rose steadily in the polls this time with a divisive discourse emphasizing conservative family values and playing on Chileans' fears that a surge in migration — from Haiti and Venezuela — is driving crime.A longtime lawmaker, he has a record of attacking Chile's LGBTQ community and advocating more restrictive abortion laws. He also accused outgoing President Sebastian Pinera, a fellow conservative, of betraying the economic legacy of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the country’s former military leader. Kast's brother, Miguel, was one of Pinochet's top advisers.Boric, 35, would become Chile’s youngest modern president. He was among several activists elected to Congress in 2014 after leading protests for higher quality education. If elected, he said, he will “bury” the neoliberal economic model left by Pinochet and raise taxes on the “super rich” to expand social services, fight inequality and boost protections of the environment.In recent days, both candidates tried to veer toward the center.“I'm not an extremist. ... I don't feel far right,” Kast proclaimed in the final stretch even as he was dogged by revelations that his German-born father had been a card-carrying member of Adolf Hitler's Nazi party.Meanwhile Boric, who is backed by a coalition of leftist parties that includes Chile's Communist Party, brought more centrist advisers onto his team and promised that any changes would be gradual and fiscally responsible.“On both sides, people are voting out of fear,” said Funk. “Neither side is particularly enthused with their candidate but they are voting out of fear that, if Kast wins, there will an authoritarian regression or because they fear Boric is too young, inexperienced and aligned with the communists.”Whoever wins is likely to have a slim mandate and will be hemmed in by a divided congress.In addition, the political rules could soon change because a newly elected convention is rewriting the country's Pinochet-era constitution. The convention — the nation's most powerful elected institution — could in theory call for new presidential elections when it concludes its work next year and if the new charter is ratified in a plebiscite.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/early-results-favor-ex-protest-leader-for-chile-s-presidency-101639951848419.html
20-12-2021||World||Threat of Omicron looms over Xmas holidays in Europe, US||The Netherlands went into lockdown on Sunday and the possibility of more Covid-19 restrictions over the Christmas and New Year period loomed over several European countries as the Omicron coronavirus variant spreads quickly.In the United States, White House medical adviser Anthony Fauci urged people travelling over the holidays to get booster shots and always wear masks in crowded public spaces.He described Omicron as “raging through the world”, and said travelling will increase the risk of infection even among vaccinated people.US President Biden plans to speak on Tuesday on the status of the fight against Covid-19 and discuss government help for communities in need of assistance, White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted.Snap lockdown begins in the NetherlandsDutch urban centres were largely deserted as the country began a snap lockdown that left people’s Christmas plans in disarray.Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced the shutdown on Saturday evening, ordering the closure of all but essential stores, as well as restaurants, hairdressers, gyms, museums and other public places from Sunday until at least January 14.While the Netherlands took the plunge and shut down much of public life to prevent its healthcare system from being overwhelmed by an expected surge in cases, several other European governments are considering more curbs - at a time when people are normally spending money on shopping, entertainment and travel.UK doesn’t rule out more Covid-19 restrictionsBritain reported a surge in cases of Omicron on Saturday, with 25,000 recorded so far. Government advisors said this could be the tip of the iceberg and health minister Sajid Javid declined on Sunday to rule out the chance of further Covid-19 restrictions before Christmas.Javid said the government was taking the “sobering” advice of its scientists seriously, was watching the data on an “almost hourly basis” and would balance that against the broader impact of restrictions on areas such as businesses and education.In Italy, the government is considering new measures to avoid a surge in infections during the holiday period, local newspapers reported on Sunday. After holding a meeting with ministers on December 23, Prime Minister Mario Draghi could mandate that people who have been vaccinated also show a negative test to access crowded places, including discos and stadiums, daily Corriere della Sera reported.Meanwhile, Israel’s cabinet weighed banning travel with the US, Canada and eight other countries to try to mitigate the local spread of the Omicron variant. If approved, the new restrictions will go into effect at midnight on Tuesday, the health ministry said. The highly infectious new strain is in the community transmission phase and has spurred a fifth wave of the pandemic in Israel, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett told the cabinet on Sunday. There are dozens of confirmed and suspected Omicron cases in Israel, including most of 17 confirmed Covid cases aboard a recent flight from the US.Two Omicron cases in the central Chinese cityTwo new cases of the Omicron variant were detected in the central Chinese city of Changsha from arrivals into the country, the Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday.The provincial capital of Hunan is the latest place to discover the highly contagious variant in incoming travellers, after the southern province of Guangdong and the northern metropolis of Tianjin reported cases earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/threat-of-omicron-looms-over-xmas-holidays-in-europe-us-101639951151579.html
20-12-2021||World||Johnson appoints foreign secretary to be Brexit negotiator||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday announced the appointment of Britain's foreign secretary to become the country's lead negotiator with the European Union, after long-time ally David Frost resigned after a week political upheaval in the Conservative Party.Liz Truss will have ministerial responsibility with the EU and will lead negotiations to resolve problems arising from provisions of the Brexit agreement covering trade with Northern Ireland, the prime minister’s office said in a statement.In his resignation letter, Frost expressed concern about the government’s “current direction of travel.’’“I hope we will move as fast as possible to where we need to get to: a lightly regulated, low tax, entrepreneurial economy, at the cutting edge of modern science and economic change,’’ he wrote.Frost also expressed growing disillusionment with the Conservative government’s policies on taxation and Covid-19.The Mail on Sunday, which broke the story of his resignation, said Frost’s decision was triggered by last week’s introduction of new pandemic restrictions, including a requirement that people show proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test to enter nightclubs and other crowded venues.In his resignation letter to Johnson, Frost said the U.K. needed to “learn to live with Covid-19. ... You took a brave decision in July, against considerable opposition, to open up the country again. Sadly it did not prove to be irreversible, as I wished, and believe you did too. I hope we can get back on track soon and not be tempted by the kind of coercive measures we have seen elsewhere.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-appoints-foreign-secretary-to-be-brexit-negotiator-101639941397045.html
20-12-2021||World||HT This Day: Dec 20, 1998 - Bill Clinton nailed on two counts of impeachment||N. C. MenonWashington- UNITED STATES House of Representatives voted this afternoon to impeach President William Jefferson Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice. Mr Clinton thus became the first elected US President to be impeached. President Andrew Jackson had also been impeached 130 years ago but he was not an elected president, having taken over after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Four articles of impeachment had been brought against Mr Clinton, two for perjury, and one each for obstruction of justice and abuse of office. The first article pertaining to giving false information to the grand jury in the Monica Lewinsky case was passed 228 to 205, with five Democrats and five Republicans crossing sides. The third article about obstruction of justice was passed, whereas the one about abuse of office failed, with a large number of Republicans voting against. The second article about perjury in the Paula Jones case was lost 205 to 229 with the same five Democrats voting for impeachment, but 27 Republicans voting against. The fact that the Paula Jones case had been thrown out of court clearly led to the feeling that perjury was harder to prove. In the event, it did not matter how the last three votes turned out since passage of the first article of impeachment was sufficient to ensure that the case will now go to the Senate for a trial. That process could take several weeks or months depending on how the Upper House decides to handle the process. Removing the President from office requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate. It is considered highly unlikely that the Republicans, with a strength of only 55 can engineer enough defections from the Democratic ranks. The Democrats made a last minute effort to introduce an amendment to consider an alternative of a censure of the President. But that was ruled out. The Democrats then walked out en bloc. On the steps of the august capital building, minority leader Dick Gephardt and minority whip Bonior expressed deep disappointment and sense of outrage at what they termed as a partisan and unfair procedure. Democratic members are scheduled to go to the White House later in the day to express their solidarity with President Clinton, who is expected to urge an end to the insidious politics of personal destruction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ht-this-day-dec-20-1998-bill-clinton-nailed-on-two-counts-of-impeachment-101639939029886.html
