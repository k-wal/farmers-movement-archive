People are just too content with their lives to drastically change,” the Vice reported one user writing.Some other users also blamed the Chinese government's one-child policy that saw the authorities heavily penalising families violating the rule.Meanwhile, gender ratio remains a massive problem in the country with data released by the Chinese government this year showing that the country has 35 million more single men than women. Furthermore, the number of singles in China is likely to cross 90 million in few years, according to the Vice report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-chinese-city-is-creating-database-of-its-singles-holding-dating-parties-101640860281827.html
30-12-2021||World||Ghislaine Maxwell faces legal bar in bid to topple sex abuse conviction: experts||British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell is going to appeal her conviction for setting up teenage girls to have sexual encounters with financier Jeffrey Epstein, but experts said she will struggle to clear the high legal bar needed to overturn the verdict.U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan dealt several blows to the defense during the month-long trial that ended on Wednesday, including denying a request to have some witnesses testify anonymously and another to block lawyers for two of the accusers from taking the stand.Legal experts said Maxwell's lawyers are likely to cite such rulings in any appeal of her conviction on five of six counts, including sex trafficking, by a jury in federal court in Manhattan.But to succeed, her lawyers would have to show that Nathan violated federal rules of evidence or abused her discretion."We have already started working on the appeal, and we are confident that she will be vindicated," Maxwell's lawyer Bobbi Sternheim told reporters on Wednesday, without going into specific legal grounds.Even if an appellate court agreed that Nathan made a mistake, Maxwell's lawyers would need to show that it mattered to the outcome of the case. A "harmless error" is not enough to overturn a conviction, according to Bennett Gershman, a professor at Pace Law School."It's a very heavy burden," Gershman said, adding that federal appellate courts tend to defer to trial judges.An avenue of appeal for the defense might be to argue that the testimony of Kate, one of the accusers, was improperly admitted.While described in the indictment as a victim, Nathan instructed the jury that Kate was actually over the age of consent at the time of her alleged encounters with Epstein. However, Nathan said the jury could still consider her testimony if they found it useful."While the court limited that testimony, and gave the jury an appropriate limiting instruction, the defense may continue to argue that Kate's testimony should have been excluded," said Sarah Krissoff, a partner at the Day Pitney law firm and a former federal prosecutor.The defense also objected to Nathan's instruction to the jury that they could find Maxwell guilty if she deliberately ignored evidence of Epstein's wrongdoing, a legal concept known as "conscious avoidance."Maxwell's lawyers argued that prosecutors' theory of the case was that Maxwell was an active participant, not a mere bystander, and accused prosecutors of trying to "have it both ways."Nathan ultimately allowed the instruction after noting that the defense itself had sought to show during opening statements and cross-examination of witnesses that Maxwell was unaware of Epstein's behavior."Maxwell will have an uphill battle challenging the conscious avoidance charge, as the government presented a factual basis for such a charge," Krissoff said.Maxwell's lawyers may also raise on appeal Nathan's ruling preventing three defense witnesses from testifying anonymously.Three of Maxwell's four accusers testified under pseudonyms or used only their first names to protect their privacy as victims of sexual abuse.But Nathan said privacy concerns did not apply to the defense witnesses because none of them intended to testify about sensitive personal topics or sexual conduct.Gershman said that any appeal would be hampered by the fact that Maxwell's lawyers waited until near the end of the trial to ask for anonymity."If they felt this was a serious concern, they should have raised this before the trial," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ghislaine-maxwell-faces-legal-bar-in-bid-to-topple-sex-abuse-conviction-experts-101640866111623.html
30-12-2021||World||Saudi boosts pandemic measures at Mecca's Grand Mosque||Saudi Arabia on Thursday reimposed social distancing measures at the Grand Mosque in the Muslim holy city of Mecca, after recording the highest number of infections in months.Workers have returned floor markings removed on October 17 to guide people to social distance in and around the Grand Mosque -- which is built around the Kaaba, the black cubic structure towards which Muslims around the world pray.Saudi authorities said they will reimpose "social distancing requirements between worshippers and pilgrims" at the Grand Mosque, without specifying whether a capacity has been set.Earlier, the kingdom had said social distancing and masks were again required in both indoor and outdoor venues.The kingdom of approximately 34 million people has so far recorded more than 554,000 coronavirus cases, including 8,874 deaths, the highest number of fatalities among the Gulf Arab countries.On Wednesday, Saudi recorded 744 cases, the highest number since mid-August.The Covid-19 pandemic hugely disrupted Muslim pilgrimages, which are usually key revenue earners for the kingdom, bringing in some $12 billion annually.The six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar -- have been recording their highest numbers of new cases in months.Despite having the world's highest vaccination rate, the UAE has recorded the largest number of infections among Gulf countries at more than 757,000.On Wednesday, it recorded 2,234 infections, the highest number since June.The Emirates' Abu Dhabi crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, sought to reassure the people that "the UAE health sector is fully geared and prepared to address any challenges", according to the official WAM news agency.The UAE is gearing up to host New Year's Eve celebrations, including at Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest tower, in the emirate of Dubai.Dubai, which is heavily dependent on tourism, was one of the world's first destinations to welcome back visitors July 2020.It is also counting on the six-month Expo 2020 trade fair to boost its economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-boosts-pandemic-measures-at-mecca-s-grand-mosque-101640865837813.html
30-12-2021||World||As lockdown drags on, Xi'an residents complain of food shortages||Residents in the locked-down Chinese city of Xi'an said they were struggling to find enough food, despite Beijing insisting Thursday that there were now adequate supplies.China has followed a strict "zero Covid" approach involving tight border restrictions and swift, targeted lockdowns since the virus first surfaced in a central city in late 2019.The country's commerce ministry told reporters on Thursday that Xi'an's 13 million residents -- who were placed under lockdown eight days ago -- had "sufficient" access to essential supplies.State TV showed footage of workers in hazmat suits sorting eggs, meat and vegetables into plastic bags, before delivering them to residents door-to-door.Local officials said at a later press conference that they had handed out hundreds of tonnes of free food and supplies in recent days.But they also asked residents to exercise "understanding and tolerance" as they smooth out oversupply "discrepancies"."At present, Xi'an is speeding up its preparations and coordination [for delivering supplies]," said local official Zhao Li."There will be some discrepancies in the timing of supplies during this process, which also varies in practical terms from place to place."Locked-down people inside Xi'an contacted by AFP, however, said they were struggling to secure enough food.Resident Ada Zhao said she knew of some individual housing compounds that had received deliveries, but said it was "still a very small number.""In our community, we've not received any notices on deliveries of life essentials and how to collect them."She said soaring demand for online grocery services was meant there wasn't enough stock or drivers, with people "struggling to get the food they need on time".Another woman who spoke to AFP said she hadn't had received any food, but had managed to receive a delivery from the local convenience store two days ago."I have rice at home... I have several eggs left -- one per meal, one meal per day," she said.While low compared to outbreaks around the world, daily infections remained high in Xi'an by China standards, with another 155 infections reported on Thursday.There have been more than a thousand cases in the city since December 9.Other tough curbs to control the city cluster have included ordering all cars off the road, telling students to remain in their dormitories, and multiple rounds of mass testing.One resident who didn't want to be named told AFP she only had enough food because she had persuaded the community manager at the gate to let her slip out to the supermarket for half an hour to get supplies.Supplies were low and the vegetables were not fresh, she said, adding that by Thursday police had been stationed outside the block.When the lockdown was announced last week, the rules allowed one resident out every two days to stock up on supplies. This was then reduced to every three days, before residents were no longer allowed out at all.Online some residents reported having received food parcels, but many more complained they were still struggling."I heard friends in other districts got their food delivered, but not here in Weiyang district," a resident surnamed Wang told AFP, saying she was working through all her supplies."I live on.... a bowl of porridge everyday -- just a little bit to keep alive."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-lockdown-drags-on-xi-an-residents-complain-of-food-shortages-101640863928703.html

The payments were duplicated in bank accounts due to a “technical issue”, a bank spokeswoman said.Around 75,000 individuals and companies received the money for a second time from around 2,000 accounts with Santander on December 25. These individuals and businesses had already received a one-off payment.The second payment was made directly from the bank’s own reserves.The accounts where the money has been sent are from various other banks like HSBC, NatWest etc which has made the recovery extremely difficult.These banks told the Daily Mail that they fear some of the recipients have already spent the money.Pay UK, which runs the main payment systems in the UK, is discussing the issue with Santander. The bank, meanwhile, is desperately trying to recover the amount and is communicating with other banks or directly with recipients of the cash.“We're sorry that due to a technical issue some payments from our corporate clients were incorrectly duplicated on the recipients' accounts,” the bank's spokeswoman said.“The duplicated payments were the result of a scheduling issue, which we quickly identified and rectified. The recipients and purpose of payment will have varied among clients but could have included wages or supplier payments,” she added.This is not the first time that Santander is in the middle of a controversy. In May this year, the bank was forced to issue an apology after a technical glitch prevented its customers from making payments for almost an entire day.In August, thousands of customers were unable to access their online accounts due to another issue.Santander has 14 million customers and 400 physical branches in the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/were-sorry-santander-sends-130-million-to-customers-in-christmas-day-error-101640863211100.html
30-12-2021||World||Studies estimate 70-80% T Cells responses fight against Omicron||An unsung arm of the immune system appears to protect against severe disease with the omicron variant even when antibodies wane, helping to explain why a record wave of infections hasn’t engulfed hospitals so far.T cells, the body’s weapon against virus-infected cells, were primed enough by vaccination that they defended against omicron in separate studies from Erasmus University in the Netherlands and the University of Cape Town in South Africa. The findings could help explain why the wave of omicron cases hasn’t so far caused a surge in mortality from South Africa to the U.S. and the U.K. Unlike antibodies, T cells can target the whole of the virus’s spike protein, which remains largely similar even in the highly mutated omicron. The Dutch researchers looked at 60 vaccinated health-care workers and found that while their antibody responses to omicron were lower or nonexistent compared with the beta and delta variants, T cell responses were largely unaltered, “potentially balancing the lack of neutralizing antibodies in preventing or limiting severe Covid-19.”The study from the University of Cape Town’s Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine looked at patients who had recovered from Covid or been vaccinated with shots from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE or Johnson & Johnson. They found that 70% to 80% of the T cell responses they assessed held up against omicron.Recent weeks have brought evidence that the new strain can erode vaccine protection, prompting governments to push for booster shots to raise the level of antibodies that can fight off the variant. But immune protection has several layers. While antibodies block infection, T cells kill infected cells, preventing the virus from spreading and causing worse disease, Wendy Burgens, one of the University of Cape Town study authors, wrote on her Twitter account Virus Monologues. “They can’t prevent you from getting infected, but they can minimize the damage that comes afterwards,” she said. T cells are white blood cells that can remember past diseases, kill virus-infected cells and rouse antibodies to marshal defenses. People infected with another coronavirus that was responsible for the SARS outbreak in 2003, for example, were found to still have a T-cell response to the disease 17 years later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/health/studies-show-t-cells-fight-omicron-101640860844805.html

This comes a day after the office of Stand News was raided and seven current and former staff members were arrested.The outlet had said after that raid that it would cease operations.According to local media reports, the two staff members charged with sedition are Chung Pui-kuen and Patrick Lam, who were editors at Stand News. They were taken to West Kowloon court on Thursday.Police also said they would prosecute the company for sedition.Apart from Chung and Lam, four other former Stand News board members, including singer Denise Ho and former lawmaker Margaret Ng, were arrested on Wednesday. Ho was released from police custody on Thursday afternoon.The raids were carried out under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing in Hong Kong last year. The ordinance dates from Hong Kong’s days as a British colony before 1997, when it was returned to China. Many pro-democracy groups have been dissolved, journalists arrested and some media outlets (Apple Daily) shut down since the imposition of the law.Those convicted after the latest raid on Wednesday could face up to two years in prison and a fine of up to 5,000 Hong Kong dollars ($640).Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said at a news conference Thursday that the arrests were not targeted at the media.“Journalism is not sedition, but seditious acts and activities and inciting other people through other acts and activities could not be condoned under the guise of news reporting,” she said.“It should be very clear what is reporting of news, and what is seditious acts or activities to undermine national security.”The police have accused Stand News of publishing articles that incited hatred towards the Hong Kong government between July 2020 and November 2021, which included news reports and blog posts."They described Hong Kong protesters as 'being disappeared' and 'violated'... These are malicious allegations without any factual basis," Steve Li, senior superintendent of the national security police, told a press conference on Wednesday.Meanwhile, announcing its closure, Stand News thanked its readers, saying it was established as a non-profit in December 2014 to "take a stand in Hong Kong".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stand-news-raid-hong-kong-police-charge-2-from-news-outlet-with-sedition-101640861065049.html
30-12-2021||World||Brexit: Britain asks — was it worth it?||Food shortages, foreign workers leaving and gas stations running empty. Britain certainly had its fair share of setbacks since the Brexit transition period — meant to smooth the UK's departure from the EU — came to an end a year ago.A supply chain crisis, exacerbated by a shortage of truck drivers and other workers from EU countries, caused empty supermarket shelves, long lines for fuel for several weeks in September and even the slaughter and disposal of thousands of pigs.New rules governing EU-UK trade took effect in January 2021, requiring 4-page customs forms for all goods, and health certificates for meat and dairy produce. As a result, British exports to the EU fell nearly 15% in the first 10 months of the year, according to the EU's statistics agency Eurostat, while UK agri-food exports dropped by more than a quarter.Brexit or COVID to blame?All this happened as the country battled the then-new Delta variant of the coronavirus that sent the UK into its third national lockdown. While the government insisted it was impossible to disentangle Brexit from the COVID effect, many economists disagreed."What we can say is that the notable loss of UK trade with continental Europe … was not mirrored in UK trade with the rest of the world," Iain Begg, Professorial Research Fellow at the European Institute, London School of Economics (LSE), told DW.Brexit was supposed to bring an end to EU bureaucracy, but instead of allowing a bonfire of red tape, the additional paperwork hiked export costs that hit many UK and EU-based businesses hard.Small British firms, in particular, said their sales to the EU dropped off a cliff. Simon Spurrell, the co-founder of the Cheshire Cheese Company, told the Guardian newspaper recently that the post-Brexit trade deal was the "biggest disaster any government has ever negotiated." Some EU retailers have stopped taking orders from the UK."It's the small businesses that suffer from the excessive paperwork, not the giants like Nissan," said Begg, referring to the Japanese automaker that has renewed its commitment to UK production, despite Brexit uncertainty.Yes, more bureaucracy!Red tape is set to get much worse from January, as the UK introduces new paperwork for imports from the EU, which must be lodged with authorities before goods are loaded on trains or trucks to Britain. The plans have been delayed three times over the past year to avoid further pain for businesses.Adding insult to injury for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was the resignation this month of his chief Brexit negotiator, Lord David Frost. Some analysts speculated that the departure was hastened by pressure on Johnson to adopt a softer approach to negotiations with Brussels, as an all-out trade war loomed over several thorny issues.Much 'unfinished business'The post-Brexit trade deal left much "unfinished business," according to Begg, including over Northern Ireland, fisheries and financial services. The City of London financial hub is a major contributor to the British economy, and was "almost neglected" in the Brexit negotiations, he told DW.The City is trying to obtain what's known as equivalence with the EU — where both sides accept each other's regulations. But the Institute of Government think tank believes a permanent deal is currently unlikely.Jake Green, from London law firm Ashurst, told the Financial News weekly that Brexit was "going to get real" for banks and other financial firms in 2022, adding that the past 12 months have "been a bit of a hall pass for everyone."The row between Britain and France over fishing rights in UK-EU waters is set to persist, while the Northern Ireland protocol — a measure to avoid a hard border between the British territory of Northern Ireland and EU member, the Republic of Ireland — will only be settled when London concedes that the European Court of Justice should rule on trade disputes."The optimal outcome for Northern Ireland would be if the border became almost invisible," Begg told DW. "There is a move towards that, but it will never be 100% because logic says you must have a border somewhere."UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has taken charge of the UK's Brexit negotiations. Truss is charged with keeping Euroskeptics within the ruling UK Conservative Party onside about the direction of Brexit, while not antagonizing Brussels further.Describing how Johnson and Frost "managed to rub people up the wrong way," Begg said the British had "misunderstood Germany's position on Brexit," thinking that Berlin would intervene during the Brexit standoff with the EU to avoid compromising a key export market for German automakers."Angela Merkel never rode to their [the British government's] rescue and I very much doubt that new Chancellor Olaf Scholz will do anything different."'Global Britain' concept underwhelmsFew positives have emerged about Global Britain — the promise that Brexit would allow the UK to boost its trade with the rest of the world A free trade deal with the United States remains elusive, especially since Donald Trump's election defeat, and closer trade ties with China are off the table for now due to political tensions over Hong Kong.While Britain has concluded new deals with Japan, Australia and New Zealand, "It's more a question of: 'Who cares?'" said Begg, as the three countries represent a tiny share of UK exports. "Even if we double that share, they're still tiny."The post-Brexit trade deal hasn't, however, led to some of the worst doomsday predictions. Rather than half a million job losses, Britain still has a major shortage of workers — after the UK ended freedom of movement for EU nationals. Rather than a forecast 18% fall in real estate prices, British property values hit an all-time high this year, climbing more than 20% since the 2016 referendum.UK residents will have to wait another eight years to see if they are each £4,300 (€5,117, $5,780) poorer by 2030, as predicted, but Britain's Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) thinks gross domestic product (GDP) has taken a 1.4% hit since the 2016 referendum, and in the longer term, UK GDP will be 4% lower than if there had been no divorce.Many believe Brexit can be undoneDespite the gloomy headlines, political campaigning and a recent poll showing that 60% of Britons now think Brexit has gone "badly" or "worse than expected," the chances of Britain rejoining the EU remain as unlikely as ever, said Begg."The whole Brexit saga has been so painful in UK domestic politics that I cannot see any wish to rejoin anytime soon." From the EU side, "I can't see it happening in a generation, let alone in the near future."The LSE economist said Brexit has "caused enormous difficulty and wasted an incredible amount of time [for EU states] when there were other pressing problems."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-britain-asks-was-it-worth-it-101640860826765.html
30-12-2021||World||Iran state TV says Tehran launched rocket into space||Iran on Thursday announced it launched a satellite carrier rocket bearing three devices into space, though it's unclear whether any of the objects entered orbit around the Earth.The state TV report, as well as others by Iran's semiofficial news agencies, did not say when the launch was conducted nor what devices the carrier brought with it. However, the launch comes amid difficult negotiations in Vienna over Iran's tattered nuclear deal.Previous launches have drawn rebukes from the United States. The U.S. State Department, Space Force and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Ahmad Hosseini, a Defense Ministry spokesman, identified the rocket as a Simorgh, or “Phoenix,” rocket. He said the three devices were sent up 470 kilometers (290 miles).Hosseini was quoted as saying the “performance of the space center and the performance of the satellite carrier was done properly.” He described the launch as “initial," suggesting more are on the way.Iran's TV aired footage of the white rocket emblazoned with the words, “Simorgh satellite carrier” and the slogan “We can” shooting into the morning sky from Iran's Imam Khomeini Spaceport. A state TV reporter at a nearby desert site hailed the launch as “another achievement by Iranian scientists.”However, officials were silent on whether the launched objects had actually reached orbit. Iran's civilian space program has suffered a series of setbacks in recent years, including fatal fires and a launchpad rocket explosion that drew the attention of former President Donald Trump.Iranian state media recently offered a list of upcoming planned satellite launches for the Islamic Republic’s civilian space program. Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard runs its own parallel program that successfully put a satellite into orbit last year.The blast-offs have raised concerns in Washington about whether the technology used to launch satellites could advance Iran's ballistic missile development. The United States says that such satellite launches defy a United Nations Security Council resolution calling on Iran to steer clear of any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.Iran, which long has said it does not seek nuclear weapons, maintains its satellite launches and rocket tests do not have a military component.Announcing a launch as nuclear negotiators meet in Vienna aligns with Tehran's hard-line posture under President Ebrahim Raisi, a recently elected conservative cleric.New Iranian demands in the nuclear talks have exasperated Western nations and heightened regional tensions as Tehran presses ahead with atomic advancements. Diplomats have repeatedly raised the alarm that time is running out to restore the accord, which collapsed three years ago when America unilaterally withdrew under then-President Trump.Iran has now abandoned all limitations under the agreement, and has ramped up uranium enrichment from under 4% purity to 60% — a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels. International inspectors face challenges in monitoring Tehran's advances.Satellite images seen by The Associated Press suggested a launch was imminent earlier this month. The images showed preparations at the spaceport in the desert plains of Iran’s rural Semnan province, some 240 kilometers (150 miles) southeast of Tehran.Over the past decade, Iran has sent several short-lived satellites into orbit and in 2013 launched a monkey into space. But under Raisi, the government appears to have sharpened its focus on space. Iran’s Supreme Council of Space has met for the first time in 11 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-state-tv-says-tehran-launched-rocket-into-space-101640860501491.html
30-12-2021||World||Sudan forces seal Khartoum as opponents gear for new anti-coup rally||Sudanese security forces deployed on Khartoum's streets Thursday, sealing the capital off from its suburbs and cutting mobile internet as opponents of the military government prepared to hold fresh protests.Pro-democracy activists have kept up a campaign of street demonstrations against the army's October 25 coup despite a crackdown that has seen at least 48 people die in protest-related violence, according to the independent Doctors' Committee.Army, police and paramilitary patrols criss-crossed Khartoum's streets, while shipping containers blocked the Nile bridges that connect the capital with its northern suburbs and its twin city Omdurman.The bridges were blocked off for the last protests on December 26, when tens of thousands took to the streets.But for Thursday's planned protests, new surveillance cameras had been installed on the major thoroughfares along which demonstrators were due to march.Activists use the internet for organising demonstrations and broadcasting live footage of the rallies.US appeal for calmThe US embassy appealed for restraint from the government led by military chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, which had been counting on a controversial November partnership deal with civilian Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok to calm public anger."The US embassy reiterates its support for peaceful expression of democratic aspiration, and the need to respect and protect individuals exercising free speech," a statement said."We call for extreme discretion in use of force and urge authorities to refrain from employing arbitrary detention."Activists have condemned sexual attacks during December 19 protests, in which the UN said at least 13 women and girls were raped.Hamdok had been held under effective house arrest for weeks before being reinstated under the November deal, which promised elections for July 2023.But the deal was widely criticised as a gift to the military that gave a cloak of legitimacy to its coup.Sudan still has no functioning government, a prerequisite for the resumption of international aid cut in response to the coup.Over 14 million people, a third of Sudan's population, will need humanitarian aid next year, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the highest level for a decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudan-forces-seal-khartoum-as-opponents-gear-for-new-anti-coup-rally-101640857978938.html

30-12-2021||World||Africa targets for vaccine self-reliance after being left behind in pandemic||After the Ebola crisis ended in West Africa in 2016, Amadou Sall received a painting as a gift from his wife and children. On one side is a family shrouded in darkness, threatened by a looming virus. The other is filled with bright light, a symbol of the science that will save them.The work by a Senegalese artist hangs on the wall of Sall’s office at the Institut Pasteur of Dakar, the biomedical research center he leads in the nation’s capital.“It’s a reminder of why I do this job,” said Sall, a veteran infectious disease expert.The institute is a partner in a $200 million vaccine manufacturing project, part of a broader effort to strengthen Africa’s defenses against Covid-19, malaria and a range of deadly pathogens that could strike in the coming years. The continent imports about 99% of all the shots it needs. The goal is to slash that to 40% over the next two decades. “This isn’t a project only about making a vaccine,” said Sall, whose facility has made yellow fever inoculations for many years. “It’s a great opportunity to build a future.”After the coronavirus emerged, many developing nations turned to Covax, the global distribution program. But the initiative has struggled to access doses, hobbled by production delays and export bans. While Covax was counting on India’s manufacturing muscle, the government prioritized its own citizens when a lethal wave of infections hit earlier this year.A new plant, under construction on the edge of Dakar and expected to begin production in 2022, could help Africa avert a replay of the past year’s lopsided vaccine rollout. Manufacturing has been concentrated in just a handful of countries, and wealthy governments have secured most doses, leaving Africa and other regions far behind. Of the more than 8 billion doses given around the world, just 3% have gone to people in Africa, the World Health Organization estimates.The fast-spreading omicron variant underscores the need to distribute supplies and technologies more widely. As the virus continues to rampage, the risk additional variants of concern will emerge and evade protection from vaccines increases, posing a threat to both rich countries and poor.“We see very clearly today that whenever you have a variant, it becomes a problem for everybody,” Sall said.The project, backed by European countries, the U.S., the World Bank and others, aims to produce 300 million doses a year targeting Covid and other diseases, helping to ensure Africa is better equipped when the next contagion comes. Institut Pasteur has teamed with Germany’s BioNTech SE and is talking with other potential partners, Sall said.Yet even reaching those ambitious goals would leave Africa far short of the vaccine supplies needed to give two doses to each of its more than 700 million adults. And Africa’s wider plan will depend on raising additional funds, strengthening regulation and expanding distribution efforts and training, potentially taking years to deliver.“We cannot afford to fail,” said Cheikh Oumar Seydi, who leads the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s work on the continent.The plan in Dakar is to produce shots using different technologies, in case one is less successful, said Sall, who is working with other companies including Belgium’s Univercells. The project could also pay dividends in other ways, spurring more investment, building trust in health systems and leaving the next generations in a better spot, he said.Under pressure to help narrow the vaccine divide, a number of companies are stepping up two years into the pandemic. BioNTech, working with the governments of Senegal and Rwanda, sees a network that could eventually supply hundreds of millions of doses to the continent. The company will produce messenger RNA vaccines, harnessing the novel technology BioNTech and its U.S. partner Pfizer Inc. used successfully to make a Covid shot. BioNTech and Pfizer also plan to produce their Covid vaccine at the Biovac Institute in Cape Town. That’s expected to start in the third quarter of 2022, manufacturing at a rate of 100 million doses annually, according to Biovac Chief Executive Officer Morena Makhoana. The facility will focus on filling vials and packaging.In another development, Moderna Inc., whose Covid shot has yet to reach vast parts of the world, plans to spend as much as $500 million to build a factory in Africa that could make half a billion mRNA vaccine doses a year. (Health advocates have said that sharing knowledge and technologies such as mRNA is crucial to expand production, and have urged Moderna to support a WHO initiative already underway rather than pursue its own project.)“All of us realize that we need to do something about building capacity in Africa,” Thomas Cueni, director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations, the industry group, said on a recent panel.But as more vaccine makers jump in, there are worries about whether they will follow through on their promises, according to Petro Terblanche, managing director of Cape Town-based biotech company Afrigen Biologics and Vaccines.“That’s one of the biggest risks to the strategy,” said Terblanche, whose company is working with the WHO and others on an mRNA hub to produce new shots and train people from other countries to make them.Afrigen and its partners are pressing ahead with plans to reproduce the Moderna vaccine, even as the company seeks a license and answers to technical questions, she said.“We’re not sitting and waiting,” she said.Research highlighted by Human Rights Watch this month showed production of mRNA vaccines is possible outside the U.S. and Europe, with more than 100 companies globally – eight in Africa – potentially able to make them.“The biggest lesson for us is that we cannot rely on the rest of the world to provide us with health security when the rest of the world is in a pandemic,” Terblanche said. “There’s a rude awakening that this cannot be repeated, ever.”The wide gap in access between rich and poor has motivated scientists, health officials and companies to try build up the region’s autonomy.At least five African countries are involved in vaccine manufacturing, some just focused on filling vials and finishing the process. Building on the expertise of the main players, like the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, will be vital.“There is so much goodwill, so much commitment to ensure we turn this around that I think we are going to get it right,” Terblanche said. “Despite the disruption of Covid, Africa will in the long term come out of this in a better position.”During the height of the pandemic, Sall’s family gave him another painting of two wrestlers sparring, a message that he needs to be strategic in the fight against new adversaries.“We may have other Covids -- they may not be necessarily Covid, but they may be influenza or another new disease, and the world should be prepared for that,” Sall said. “Epidemics may be our way of life. We have to deal with them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/africa-targets-for-vaccine-self-reliance-after-being-left-behind-in-pandemic-101640855211208.html
30-12-2021||World||Harry Reid: US senate powerhouse who rescued the Indian nuclear deal||Many people played varying degrees of crucial roles in the signing and legislating of the landmark civil nuclear deal that changed the trajectory of the India-US relationship. US senator Harry Reid, the once powerful Democrat who passed away on Tuesday, played an incomparable part in it.“There would have been no civil nuclear deal without senator Reid’s early support and his shepherding of the deal through the Senate,” said Richard Verma, the former American ambassador to India who worked as a congressional foreign affairs aide to senator Reid at the time.Reid first played a critical role in December 2006 when he rescued from near death a legislation allowing then President George W Bush to negotiate a nuclear deal with India, which, in turn, would facilitate the resumption of nuclear trade with India after more than three decades.As the incoming majority leader of the chamber - Democrats had won control of the chamber in the November mid-term elections - Reid had prioritised the passage of the legislation. If not passed before the new Congress took over in January, the bill would have had to restart the long and tortuous passage rites.“That would have killed the bill,” said Ramesh Kapur, a leading Democratic strategist recalling Reid’s role in the passage of the bill. He had a ring-side view of the passage of the bill, which was aided and facilitated by the combined clout of Indian-Americans like him.Harry Reid had promised to put the bill on “automatic pilot” so that it may be taken up as “the first order of business” after the break, when it met during the lame-duck session, which is typically a session that take place between an election and formal start of the next congress.Verma said, recalling those heady days, “He even convened a rare classified session of the Senate so senators could debate the arrangements under consideration. He told me several times how important the deal was and how it would transform US-India ties. He was absolutely right.” The deal did, in fact, change India-US ties. First announced by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Bush in July 2005, the deal went into effect in 2008 and those it has not led to any real trade in nuclear supplies between the two countries yet, it put ties on an upward trajectory, and rising.Two years later, in December 2008, the deal got the final approval from US Congress with Reid at the head of the Senate.Harry Reid died on Tuesday at age 82. He had struggled for years with pancreatic cancer. Once a boxer, he was known for his pugnacious politics during his five terms in the Senate ending in 2016, when he retired. He was a quintessential Washington DC powerhouse and power-player who may even have set Barack Obama for the presidency asking a “stunned” first-time senator from Illinois in 2006 to seriously consider a run.After the senate vote on November 17, 2006, Reid spoke of his fondness for India and Indian-Americans to a group of Indian-Americans who had been lobbying him, his office and other senators, especially those who had seemed wobbly about their vote.Kapur was among them and remembers - “being a Punjabi” - giving Reid a celebratory hug.Reid spoke to the group about a group of Indian students he had befriended years ago as he gave them a ride on their way to their college. Some of them, Kapur remembers Reid noting, wore “slippers”.As a parting gift - along with “five” Indian meals - the Indian students gave Reid a snow globe with an image of Mahatma Gandhi inside it. The senator kept it on his desk for years after and Kapur remembers noticing it.“100% true,” said Verma. It was “there on his bookcase in the leader’s office till his very last day in the Senate”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harry-reid-us-senate-powerhouse-who-rescued-the-indian-nuclear-deal-101640848591447.html

The World Health Organization (WHO) has already warned that Omicron along with the Delta variant will push health systems on the brink of collapse.According to news agency Reuters, from December 22 and December 28, almost 900,000 cases of Covid-19 were being recorded on an average daily.Even though initial studies have suggested that the Omicron variant of Covid-19, first detected in South Africa in November, is milder and less deadly than the previous ones, its high spreading rate could overwhelm hospitals in many countries in near future.Here are the latest updates on Covid-19 across the world:1. France on Wednesday saw a record spike in its daily cases after 208,099 people were found to be infected with Covid-19. In Paris, people will be required to wear masks when outdoors from Friday to slow the spread of the virus fuelled by the Omicron variant. The order applies to everyone above the age of 11.2. Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales, recorded 12,226 new cases in the last 24 hours. Among these, Sydney reported 746 hospitalised patients. On Thursday, the country’s state and territory leaders will meet Prime Minister Scott Morrison to discuss issues such as long queues for Covid testing, the definition of a close contact and isolation requirements.3. The United Kingdom also set a new record in its daily Covid-19 tally with 183,037 infections on Wednesday. Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland have been placed under tougher restrictions since December 26. However, no restrictions are currently in place for England and the region is under Plan B measures.4. The Italian government will soon ease quarantine rules in a bid to keep essential services running. The government is also planning to cut the isolation period for vaccinated Covid-19 patients from seven to five days.5. In the United States, even though there is a drop in fatalities due to Covid-19, infections are still rising because of Omicron’s spread. Presidential medical adviser Anthony Fauci said on Wednesday that Omicron cases will likely peak in the US by the end of January.(With inputs from Bloomberg, Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daily-global-covid-cases-above-1mn-for-3rd-day-who-warns-on-omicron-delta-101640840224808.html

Now, a researcher in the United Kingdom, one of the worst affected countries, has identified two new symptoms which are usually not associated with coronavirus.Also Read | UK, US see record surge in daily Covid cases as Omicron spreads at alarming rateThese are nausea and loss of appetite, according to Tim Spector, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King’s College London.He said that some symptoms are present in those who have received Covid-19 vaccines, or even the booster shot.“Quite a few of them had nausea, slight temperature, sore throats and headaches" he told express.co.uk.According to Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States, some of the common symptoms associated with Omicron are cough, fatigue, congestion and runny nose.Also Read | New research claims Omicron has cold-like symptomsLast week, Dr Bruce Patterson, who works for single cell diagnostic company IncellDx, claimed that he has not seen as much of a loss of taste and smell compared to the previous variants. Dr Patterson said that Omicron looked similar to a virus called parainfluenza.Another doctor later revealed a “telltale sign” caused by the Omicron variants – really bad night sweats. “The sweats which are kind of drenching night sweats where you might have to get up and change your clothes,” The Sun reported Dr Amir Khan, a physician with the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) as saying.The Omicron variant emerged in South Africa on November 24, and has since then spread to more than 100 countries. It has led to surge in Covid-19 infection in many regions and countries of the world, especially the United States and the UK.In both the countries, Omicron is now the dominant variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, replacing Delta. In the UK, daily Covid-19 cases climbed to 183,037 on Wednesday, setting a new record in the daily tally.In most of the Europe, the situation is deteriorating due to the spread of Omicron, with healthcare systems “on the verge of collapse”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/doctor-identifies-2-new-omicron-symptoms-says-even-vaccinated-have-some-101640839936592.html

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is still too early to be reassured by initial data suggesting that Omicron leads to milder disease.Detected in South Africa last month, the fast-spreading variant caused thousands of infections in more than 100 countries.UKIn the United Kingdom, daily Covid-19 cases climbed to 183,037 on Wednesday, setting a new record in the daily tally. On the other hand, 57 more patients succumbed to the viral disease on Wednesday. The total number of cases and deaths in the UK stands at 12,559,926 and 148,089 respectively, according to government data.From Sunday, tougher restrictions for gathering at indoor and outdoor events have been in force in parts of the UK including Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, England remains without any such restrictions.England is currently under Plan B measures, which call for working from home, compulsory face masks and Covid-19 vaccination certificates for entry to large venues.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has advised that people should celebrate New Year’s Eve cautiously and urged them to get vaccinated against Covid-19. “I’m sorry to say this, but the overwhelming majority of people who are currently ending up in intensive care in our hospitals are people who are not boosted,” Johnson said on Wednesday.USThe United States, which is the worst-hit country from the Covid-19 crisis, has recorded more than 54 million cases till now. On Tuesday, the country recorded over 512,000 cases in the last 24 hours, the highest single-day spike since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020.According to data shared by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Omicron is estimated to be 58.6% of Covid-19 variants circulating in the United States. The new variant has already overwhelmed the country’s healthcare system. Nearly 9,000 patients are being hospitalised daily.Presidential medical adviser Anthony Fauci said on Wednesday that Omicron cases will likely peak in the US by the end of January.“I would imagine, given the size of our country and the diversity of vaccination versus no vaccination, that it likely will be more than a couple of weeks, probably by the end of January, I would think,” he told CNBC when asked about when cases will peak in the country.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-us-see-record-surge-in-daily-covid-cases-as-omicron-spreads-at-alarming-rate-101640831060322.html

They also underscored the need for "safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to all people in need, and for the full protection, safety and security of humanitarian and medical personnel", according to UN News.The Ambassadors reaffirmed their support for the people of Myanmar and the country's democratic transition along with their strong commitment to the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and unity of Myanmar.Credible reports suggested that four children were killed, including two 17-year-old boys, a teenage girl and a child approximately age five, whose gender was not mentioned, the UNSC said in a statement.The two humanitarians worked for the non-Governmental organization (NGO) Save the Children, which confirmed their deaths. They were killed while returning to NGO's Loikaw office after responding to humanitarian needs in a nearby community, it added.Earlier in the week, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) condemned the killings, saying it was "shocked and saddened" by the reported killing and burning of victims during a time when many prepared to celebrate Christmas.In a statement, the UNICEF Regional Director for East Asia and the Pacific, Debora Comini, condemned the attack.She reminded that the protection of civilians - particularly children and humanitarian workers - must be treated as a priority during times of conflict, in accordance with international humanitarian law and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Myanmar is a signatory."UNICEF calls for urgent action to investigate this deplorable incident and to hold those responsible to account," she said."We offer our deepest condolences to the families of the victims and to our colleagues at Save the Children".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-security-council-condemns-dec-25-killings-in-myanmar-101640826338529.html

It has said it will not give in to threats.While the United States recognises only one China, it is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself and has long followed a policy of "strategic ambiguity" on whether it would intervene militarily to protect Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack.The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the Communists, who established the People's Republic of China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-of-drastic-measures-if-taiwan-provokes-on-independence-101640828093874.html

30-12-2021||World||Covid-19: Some nations rethink isolation, testing rules as Omicron sweeps globe||Global Covid-19 infections hit a record high over the past seven-day period, Reuters data showed on Wednesday, as the Omicron variant raced out of control and governments wrestled with how to contain its spread without paralysing fragile economies.Almost 900,000 cases were detected on average each day around the world between Dec. 22 and 28, with myriad countries posting new all-time highs in the previous 24 hours, including the United States, Australia, many in Europe and Argentina and Bolivia.Although studies have suggested Omicron is less deadly than some previous variants, the huge numbers of people testing positive mean that hospitals in some countries might soon be overwhelmed, while businesses might struggle to carry on because of workers having to quarantine.Fearful of the economic impact of keeping so many people at home, some governments are looking at shortening the period that people have to isolate if they are Covid positive or have been exposed to someone who is positive.Spain said on Wednesday it was reducing the quarantine period for people who have tested positive for Covid-19 to seven days from 10, while Italy said it was planning to relax isolation rules for those who came into close contact with sufferers of the virus.Earlier this week US health authorities released new guidance shortening the isolation period for people with a confirmed infection to five days from 10, so long as they are asymptomatic."I am highly concerned that Omicron, being highly transmissible and spreading at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases," WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news briefing.French Health Minister Olivier Veran told lawmakers France was seeing a "dizzying" rise in cases, with 208,000 reported in the space of 24 hours - a national and European record.Economic impact on US unclearBritain, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus and Malta all registered record numbers of new cases on Tuesday, while the seven-day average number of new daily cases in the United States hit a record 258,312, according to a Reuters tally on Wednesday. The previous peak was 250,141, registered last January.Despite the surge in coronavirus infections, deaths and hospitalizations are comparatively low, Rochelle Walensky, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Wednesday.While the current seven-day daily average of cases is about 240,400 per day, up 60% over the previous week, the hospitalization rate for the same period is up just 14% to about 9,000 per day over the same period. Deaths were down about 7% to 1,100 per day, Walensky added.Disease experts, however, are questioning the new CDC rules that halve the isolation period for asymptomatic coronavirus infections, saying they could result in even more infections. They are concerned the new directive does not require testing to confirm that a person is no longer infectious before they go back to work or socialize.Britain reported 183,037 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, a new record and over 50,000 more than the previous highest figure registered just a day earlier, government statistics showed. Ireland, too, reported record cases on Wednesday, with more than 16,000 new infections.Despite the growing number of cases, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will not bring in new restrictions this year in England to limit the spread of Omicron, which now accounts for 90% of all community infections, according to health officials.Australia registered almost 18,300 new cases, eclipsing Tuesday's previous pandemic high of around 11,300.In Spain, demand for free testing kits from the Madrid regional government far outstripped supply, with long queues forming outside pharmacies.Early data from Britain, South Africa and Denmark suggests the risk of hospitalisation from Omicron is lower than from Delta, the WHO said in its latest epidemiological report.However, the WHO's top emergencies expert, Mike Ryan, said it was too soon to draw definitive conclusions because Omicron was so far circulating largely among younger, less vulnerable age groups.A number of governments are increasingly worried by the economic impact of huge numbers being forced into self-isolation because they had been in contact with a coronavirus sufferer."We just can't have everybody just being taken out of circulation because they just happen to be at a particular place at a particular time," Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters.Morrison wants to make urgent changes to Covid-19 testing rules to ease pressure on testing sites. He said Australia needed "a gear change" to manage overburdened laboratories and get people out of isolation.While Spain and Italy moved to relax some isolation rules, China stuck to its policy of zero tolerance, keeping 13 million people in Xian, capital of central Shaanxi province, under rigid lockdown for a seventh day as 151 new cases were reported on Tuesday, albeit none with Omicron so far."I just want to go home," said a 32-year-old mechanic who was in the city on business last week when it was effectively shut off from the outside world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-some-nations-rethink-isolation-testing-rules-as-omicron-sweeps-globe-101640821955227.html
30-12-2021||World||Jeffrey Epstein sex abuse case: Ghislaine Maxwell convicted of recruiting teenage girls||Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty by a US jury on Wednesday of helping the late financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls, sealing a remarkable fall from grace for the British socialite.Maxwell, 60, was accused of recruiting and grooming four teenagers between 1994 and 2004 for Epstein, her former boyfriend who killed himself in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges of his own.She was convicted on five of six counts. After the verdict was read, Maxwell pulled down her face mask and poured herself a glass of water.As members of the jury affirmed one-by-one that their verdict was unanimous, defense attorney Jeffrey Pagliuca patted Maxwell on her upper back. An expressionless Maxwell looked briefly at two siblings seated in the front row of the audience as she left the courtroom.Along with the trials of movie producer Harvey Weinstein and singer R. Kelly, Maxwell's case is among the highest-profile trials to take place in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which encouraged women to speak out about sexual abuse by famous and powerful people.During the trial's closing arguments in federal court in Manhattan a prosecutor said Maxwell was Epstein's "partner in crime.""Ghislaine Maxwell made her own choices. She committed crimes hand in hand with Jeffrey Epstein. She was a grown woman who knew exactly what she was doing," Assistant US Attorney Alison Moe said.Damian Williams, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, applauded the verdict in a statement that said Maxwell was convicted of "one of the worst crimes imaginable.""The road to justice has been far too long," his statement said. "But, today, justice has been done. I want to commend the bravery of the girls – now grown women – who stepped out of the shadows and into the courtroom."Maxwell's attorneys had argued she was being used as a scapegoat for Epstein and sought to portray the accounts of her four accusers as not credible, saying their memories had been corrupted over the decades and that they were motivated by money."Epstein's death left a gaping hole in the pursuit of justice for many of these women," Maxwell's defense lawyer Bobbi Sternheim said. "She's filling that hole, and filling that empty chair."Maxwell dated Epstein for several years in the 1990s, when the pair attended high society parties and traveled on luxurious private jets.A few months after Epstein's death, Maxwell purchased a home for $1 million in cash in Bradford, New Hampshire where she remained out of the limelight until her July 2020 arrest. An FBI official said Maxwell had "slithered away."Maxwell, a daughter of British press baron Robert Maxwell, had been accustomed to opulence all her life.Her father founded a publishing house and owned tabloids including the Daily Mirror. He was found dead off his yacht near the Canary Islands in 1991.Graphic testimonyUS District Judge Alison Nathan did not say when Maxwell would be sentenced. The jury deliberated for five full days before reaching the verdict.During the trial, jurors heard emotional and graphic testimony from four women, two of whom said they were 14 when Epstein began abusing them. Three of the women said Maxwell herself had inappropriately touched them.Prosecutors displayed for the jury a green massage table that was seized from Epstein's Palm Beach, Florida, estate in 2005. Three of the four accusers said they gave Epstein massages that escalated into sexual activity.Epstein's arrest and suicide drew attention to Maxwell's role in his abuses, and to the financier's relationships with prominent figures like former US Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, Britain's Prince Andrew and billionaire investor Leon Black. None has been charged with crimes related to Epstein.The prince, a former friend of Epstein, is defending against a civil lawsuit in Manhattan claiming he sexually abused Virginia Giuffre, another of Epstein's accusers. Andrew has denied her claims.The one charge Maxwell was acquitted on - enticing an underage girl to travel for the purpose of illegal sexual activity - carried a maximum penalty of five years in prison.That charge pertained only to a woman known by the pseudonym Jane, who testified that she was 14 when Epstein first abused her in 1994.Jane said she often traveled to Epstein's homes in New Mexico and New York, where some of the abuse took place, and that Maxwell sometimes helped coordinate her travel.Maxwell sometimes took part in her sexual encounters with Epstein and acted as if it was normal, Jane testified."It made me feel confused because that did not feel normal to me," Jane said. "I'd never seen anything like this or felt anything like this."Despite the not guilty verdict on that count, the jury appeared to find other aspects of Jane's story credible. They convicted Maxwell of transporting a minor to travel for illegal sex acts, another count that pertained solely to Jane.Moe said during her closing argument that Maxwell's presence made young girls feel comfortable with Epstein. Otherwise, receiving an invitation to spend time with a middle-aged man would have seemed "creepy" and "set off alarm bells," Moe said."Epstein could not have done this alone," she said.Moe reminded jurors of bank records they saw at trial showing that Epstein paid Maxwell millions of dollars over the years. She said Maxwell was motivated to do whatever it took to keep Epstein happy in order to maintain her luxurious lifestyle.Defense attorney Laura Menninger countered during closing arguments that Maxwell was an innocent woman and that prosecutors had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Maxwell was aware of or involved in any crimes Epstein committed.Maxwell's lawyers aggressively pushed back on the accusers' accounts during the trial, arguing that their stories had shifted over the years.Maxwell's defense said the women were motivated by money to implicate Maxwell since all four had received million-dollar awards from a compensation fund for Epstein's victims.But the women disputed those characterizations, saying they decided to testify out of a desire for justice, not money."Money will not ever fix what that woman has done to me," testified one woman, known by her first name Carolyn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeffrey-epstein-sex-abuse-case-ghislaine-maxwell-convicted-of-recruiting-teenage-girls-101640821190939.html
