04-12-2021||World||China criticises US democracy before Biden summit||Whether a country is democratic or not should be judged by the international community and not by a few “self-appointed judges”, China on Saturday said in an official document as it ramps up criticism against the upcoming US-organised Summit for Democracy.“There is no fixed model of democracy,” China said in the official document titled China: Democracy That Works, published on Saturday, which details its democratic endeavors.The document said whether a country is democratic “should be acknowledged by the international community, not arbitrarily decided by a few self-appointed judges”.“Over the past hundred years, the Party has led the people in realising people’s democracy in China. The Chinese people now truly hold in their hands their own future and that of society and the country,” the paper said, the official CGTN channel reported.China has termed its system “whole-process people’s democracy” after President Xi Jinping proposed the concept two years ago in Shanghai, according to Chinese official media.Ruled by the Communist Party of China (CPC) since 1949, China’s governance is firmly under the party’s control with all functions of the government – including the legislature and judiciary – fully compliant to rules laid down by the CPC.China’s legislature, the National People’s Congress, is considered largely ceremonial and a rubber-stamp for decisions finalised by the CPC.The definition does not include a free media nor universal suffrage for national office.Considered to have become increasingly authoritarian under Xi, the phrase “whole-process democracy” was enshrined in law this past March.Beijing has sharply criticised the Summit for Democracy to be held next week with Communist Party of China (CPC) officials calling it a “joke” at the release of the Chinese document on democracy on Saturday.“The US is a self-styled leader of democracy, but its so-called summit of democracy is only aimed at suppressing and containing countries with a different development model,” said Tian Peiyan, deputy director of the Policy Research Office of the CPC’s central committee.“It is set to become a joke and will not be popular,” Tian said.“Such democracy brings not happiness but disaster to voters,” he said.China has consistently criticised the west for trying to supplant its democratic model on other countries.Neither China nor Russia are among about 110 governments invited to Biden’s two-day virtual Summit for Democracy, which starts on Thursday.The participation of Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that China claims is a breakaway region has further angered Beijing.“Xi has long used the claim that the party’s governance is superior to that of the West in order to legitimise the party’s monopoly of power,” Charles Parton, a former British diplomat and a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-criticises-us-democracy-before-biden-summit-101638620354714.html

White told a news conference. White said the couple “were aided in getting into the building,” and that a person who helped them may also face charges.A Detroit business owner spotted a car tied to the Crumbleys in his parking lot late Friday, Oakland County Undersheriff Michael McCabe said in a statement. A woman seen near the vehicle ran away when the business owner called 911, McCabe said. The couple was later located and arrested by Detroit police.A prosecutor filed involuntary manslaughter charges against the Crumbleys on Friday, accusing them of failing to intervene on the day of the tragedy despite being confronted with a drawing and chilling message — “blood everywhere” — that was found at the boy’s desk.The Crumbleys committed “egregious” acts, from buying a gun on Black Friday and making it available to Ethan Crumbley to resisting his removal from school when they were summoned a few hours before the shooting, Oakland County prosecutor Karen McDonald said.Authorities had been looking for the couple since Friday afternoon. Late Friday, U.S. Marshals announced a reward of up to $10,000 each for information leading to their arrests.The Crumbley's attorney, Shannon Smith, said the pair had left town earlier in the week “for their own safety.” Smith told The Associated Press they would be returning to Oxford to be arraigned.However, White said the Crumbleys “appeared to be hiding” in the building where they were found. He added that the parents appeared to be “distressed” when they were captured.“Head down... just very upset,” he said of one of the parents.The couple was expected to be booked into the Oakland County Jail, McCabe said.Earlier, the prosecutor offered the most precise account so far of the events that led to the shooting at Oxford High School, roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Detroit.Ethan Crumbley, 15, emerged from a bathroom with a gun, shooting students in the hallway, investigators said. He’s charged as an adult with murder, terrorism and other crimes.Under Michigan law, the involuntary manslaughter charge filed against the parents can be pursued if authorities believe someone contributed to a situation where there was a high chance of harm or death.Parents in the U.S. are rarely charged in school shootings involving their children, even as most minors get guns from a parent or relative’s house, according to experts.School officials became concerned about the younger Crumbley on Monday, a day before the shooting, when a teacher saw him searching for ammunition on his phone, McDonald said.Jennifer Crumbley was contacted and subsequently told her son in a text message: “Lol. I’m not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught,” according to the prosecutor.On Tuesday, a teacher found a note on Ethan’s desk and took a photo. It was a drawing of a gun pointing at the words, “The thoughts won’t stop. Help me,” McDonald said.There also was a drawing of a bullet, she said, with words above it: “Blood everywhere.”Between the gun and the bullet was a person who appeared to have been shot twice and is bleeding. He also wrote, “My life is useless” and “The world is dead,” according to the prosecutor.The school quickly had a meeting with Ethan and his parents, who were told to get him into counseling within 48 hours, McDonald said.The Crumbleys failed to ask their son about the gun or check his backpack and “resisted the idea of their son leaving the school at that time,” McDonald said.Instead, the teen returned to class and the shooting subsequently occurred.“The notion that a parent could read those words and also know that their son had access to a deadly weapon that they gave him is unconscionable — it’s criminal,” the prosecutor said.Jennifer Crumbley texted her son after the shooting, saying, “Ethan, don’t do it,” McDonald said.James Crumbley called 911 to say that a gun was missing from their home and that Ethan might be the shooter. The gun had been kept in an unlocked drawer in the parents’ bedroom, McDonald said.Ethan accompanied his father for the gun purchase on Nov. 26 and posted photos of the firearm on social media, saying, “Just got my new beauty today,” McDonald said.Over the long Thanksgiving weekend, Jennifer Crumbley wrote on social media that it is a “mom and son day testing out his new Christmas present,” the prosecutor said.Asked at a news conference if the father could be charged for purchasing the gun for the son, McDonald said that would be the decision of federal authorities.In a video message to the community Thursday, the head of Oxford Community Schools said the high school looks like a “war zone” and won’t be ready for weeks. Superintendent Tim Throne repeatedly complimented students and staff for how they responded to the violence.He also acknowledged the meeting of Crumbley, the parents and school officials. Throne offered no details but summed it up by saying, “No discipline was warranted.”McDonald was asked about the decision to keep Crumbley in school.“Of course, he shouldn’t have gone back to that classroom. ... I believe that is a universal position. I’m not going to chastise or attack, but yeah,” she said.Asked if school officials may potentially be charged, McDonald said: “The investigation’s ongoing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/michigan-high-school-shooting-parents-of-accused-who-killed-4-caught-101638608328937.html

Among them, Maninder Sidhu was made parliamentary secretary to the minister of foreign affairs Melanie JolySidhu, who was elected to the House of Commons for the first time in October 2019 from the riding (as constituencies are called in Canada) of Brampton East, was earlier parliamentary secretary to the minister of international development.Joining him among the ranks of the parliamentary secretaries is Arif Virani, who represents the Parkdale-High Park riding in Toronto. Virani, who has roots in Gujarat, was appointed parliamentary secretary to the minister of international trade, export promotion, small business and economic development Mary Ng. He had earlier held similar positions, most recently as parliamentary secretary to minister of justice and the Attorney General in the previous Government.Ruby Sahota, who represents Brampton North, and is the former chair of the House of Commons standing committee on procedure and House affairs, will serve as deputy government whip. Interestingly, all three newly-appointed Parliamentary secretaries are from the Greater Toronto Area.“This team will be an important link between ministers and Parliament, working closely with their colleagues to find real solutions to the challenges that Canadians face, as we finish the fight against Covid-19 and build a better future for everyone,” a statement from the PMO said, announcing the new roster of parliamentary secretaries.Trudeau had appointed three Indo-Canadians to his cabinet in October, when he was forming a minority government after winning snap elections in September. They are minister of national defence Anita Anand, minister of seniors Kamal Khera, and minister of international development and minister responsible for Pacific economic development Canada Harjit Sajjan.

Hours after her statement, Reuters reported that the number of Omicron cases had gone up to 15, with at least once case in the city of York. The report said that a child under 12, who had recently travelled to South Africa, had been diagnosed with Omicron. Of the other cases reported in the country, three were detected in Toronto and, of these, two individuals recently returned from travel from Nigeria, while another recently returned from Switzerland.“These are the first cases of the Omicron variant of concern which have been confirmed by whole genome sequencing, reported in Toronto,” a statement from Toronto Public Health said.Tam, meanwhile, stressed the need for “heightened vigilance” now and during the winter, even as the variant circulates and its “significance and impact” is still being assessed.Canada has barred foreign nationals travelling from ten African nations from entering the country.It has also announced an accelerated roll-out of booster doses of the Covid vaccines for all adults above 18 who have received their initial two doses. The third jab is expected to be widely available later this month and into the next year.The National Advisory Committee on Immunization on Friday said that it had “reviewed the latest data that suggest protection against infection decreases over time since completion of a primary Covid-19 vaccine series”.While protection against severe illness remained generally high, it could decrease over time for some people, such as older adults. “Booster doses of Covid-19 mRNA vaccines can increase the immune response and are expected to offer enhanced protection against infection and severe disease and may help reduce spread of infection,” it said.It “strongly recommended” administering boosters early to those above 50, along with other more vulnerable groups like frontline healthcare workers.

The concerns of a possible Russian invasion grew after US intelligence officials reportedly determined the Kremlin’s plan to launch a military offensive against Ukraine could begin as soon as early 2022."We're aware of Russia's actions for a long time and my expectation is we're going to have a long discussion with Putin," Biden told reporters while leaving for a weekend trip to Camp David.When asked about Putin’s warning that the US deploying countermeasures in Ukraine would represent a red line for the Kremlin, Biden said, "I don't accept anybody's red lines."The new US intelligence finding estimates that Russia’s possible military offensive would include 175,000 personnel with half of them already deployed at various points near Ukraine's border, reported Associated Press citing an official in Biden administration. The report suggests that Russian propaganda machinery has intensified its operations to denigrate Ukraine and NATO ahead of a potential invasion.Earlier on Friday, Biden said he was coordinating with European allies to make it “very, very difficult” for Putin to launch an offensive against Ukraine.“What I am doing is putting together what I believe to be will be the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Mr. Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he may do,” Biden told reporters.The two world leaders last met in June at a stately 18th-century mansion in Geneva where the issues related to Ukraine were also discussed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-predicts-long-discussion-with-putin-over-possible-invasion-of-ukraine-101638588243492.html

Weather permitting, people in the path of a total solar eclipse can see the Sun’s corona, the outer atmosphere, which is otherwise usually obscured by the bright face of the Sun,” the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) said.Where will it be visible ?Antarctica will be the only place on earth from where the total solar eclipse could be seen. In some other places, where the sun, moon and the earth are not directly lined up, a partial solar eclipse could be seen. Only a part of the sun’s surface will appear to have a shadow during this celestial event.A partial eclipse could be seen in parts of Saint Helena, Namibia, Lesotho, South Africa, South Georgia and Sandwich Islands, Crozet Islands, Falkland Islands, Chile, New Zealand, and Australia, NASA said.How to watch ?Countries where the event is not visible directly, including India, can still view the event using NASA’s live streaming service. A view of the total eclipse from the Union Glacier, Antarctica would be streamed by NASA, conditional that the weather is clear during the time of the event.Is it safe to look ?A solar viewing or eclipse glass is always needed to watch the sun during the eclipse and it is never safe to directly look at it. However, during a total eclipse, it is safe to directly look at the sun during the period of totality, that is when the moon completely obscures the sun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/last-solar-eclipse-of-the-year-today-when-where-and-how-to-watch-101638584794094.html
04-12-2021||World||US intelligence finds Russia planning Ukraine offensive||US intelligence officials have determined that Russian planning is underway for a possible military offensive against Ukraine that could begin as soon as early 2022 and would include an estimated 175,000 personnel, according to an administration official.The new intelligence finding estimates that half of the Russian personel are already deployed along various points near Ukraine's border, according to a Biden administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the finding.It comes as Russia has picked up its demands on Biden to guarantee that Ukraine will not be allowed to join the NATO alliance.The official added that the plans call for the movement of 100 battalion tactical groups along with armor, artillery, and equipment.Intelligence officials also have seen an uptick in Russian information operations' use of proxies and media outlets to denigrate Ukraine and NATO ahead of a potential invasion, the official said.The intelligence findings were first reported by The Washington Post.Earlier Friday, President Joe Biden pledged to make it “very, very difficult” for Russia's Vladimir Putin to take military action in Ukraine and said new initiatives coming from his administration are intended to deter Russian aggression.The president offered the measured warning to Putin in response to growing concern about a Russian buildup of troops on the Ukrainian border and increasingly bellicose rhetoric from the Kremlin.“What I am doing is putting together what I believe to be will be the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Mr. Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he may do,” Biden told reporters.The Kremlin said Friday that Putin would seek binding guarantees precluding NATO’s expansion to Ukraine during the call with Biden, while the Ukrainian defense minister warned that Russia could invade his country next monthUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told lawmakers Friday that the number of Russian troops near Ukraine and in Russian-annexed Crimea is estimated at 94,300, warning that a “large-scale escalation” is possible in January.There are signs that the White House and Kremlin are close to arranging a conversation next week between Biden and Putin. Putin’s foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov told reporters Friday that arrangements have been made for a Putin-Biden call in the coming days, adding that the date will be announced after Moscow and Washington finalize details. The Russians say a date has been agreed upon, but declined to say when.Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have also tentatively agreed to have a call next week, according to a person close to the Ukrainian president who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said administration officials have “engaged in the possibility” of a Biden-Putin call. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment on the expected Zelenskyy call.“It certainly would be an opportunity to discuss our serious concerns about the bellicose rhetoric, about the military buildup that we’re seeing on the border of Ukraine,” Psaki said of a potential Biden-Putin call.Biden did not detail what actions he was weighing. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who met Thursday with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Sweden, said the U.S. has threatened new sanctions. He did not detail the potential sanctions but suggested the effort would not be effective.“If the new ‘sanctions from hell’ come, we will respond," Lavrov said. “We can’t fail to respond."Psaki said the administration would look to coordinate with European allies if it moved forward with sanctions. She noted that bitter memories of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that had been under Ukraine's control since 1954, are front of mind as the White House considers the way forward.“We know what President Putin has done in the past,” Psaki said. “We see that he is putting in place the capacity to take action in short order.”Deep differences were on display during the Blinken-Lavrov meeting, with the Russia official charging the West was “playing with fire” by denying Russia a say in any further NATO expansion into countries of the former Soviet Union. Zelenskyy has pushed for Ukraine to join the alliance, which holds out the promise of membership but hasn’t set a a timeline.Blinken this week said the U.S. has “made it clear to the Kremlin that we will respond resolutely, including with a range of high-impact economic measures that we’ve refrained from using in the past.”He did not detail what sanctions were being weighed, but one potentially could be to cut off Russia from the SWIFT system of international payments. The European Union’s Parliament approved a nonbinding resolution in April to cut off Russia from SWIFT if its troops entered Ukraine.Such a move would go far toward blocking Russian businesses from the global financial system. Western allies reportedly considered such a step in 2014 and 2015, during earlier Russian-led escalations of tensions over Ukraine.Then-Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said it would be tantamount to “a declaration of war.”U.S.-Russia relations have been rocky since Biden took office.In addition to the Ukraine issue, the Biden administration has levied sanctions against Russian targets and called out Putin on Kremlin interference in U.S. elections, malign cyberactivity against U.S. businesses, and the treatment of opposition figure Alexei Navalny, who was poisoned last year and then later imprisoned.Putin and Biden met face to face in Geneva in June, with the U.S. president warning if Russia crossed certain red lines — including going after major American infrastructure — his administration would respond and “the consequences of that would be devastating.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-intelligence-finds-russia-planning-ukraine-offensive-101638583862350.html

Here's what reports suggest||Jovanni Ortiz is in talks to take up a top communications role in US Vice President Kamala Harris' office, reported The Hill citing people familiar with the development. The vice president's office has meanwhile denied the reports of Ortiz’s potential appointment for a top communications role, saying it was not true.The report of Ortiz's appointment emerged after the White House on Thursday confirmed that Harris' chief spokesperson Symone Sanders will be leaving the job by year-end. Confirming the reports of Sanders’ exit, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said that "she'll always be a part of this Biden-Harris family, and it's only natural after a couple of years to be ready for something new.""Working in the first year of a White House is exciting and rewarding, but it's also gruelling and exhausting," Psaki added. "It's all of those things at once."Sanders’ is the latest departure from Kamala Harris’ office amid growing concerns of the vice president’s communication strategy and reports of her getting sidelined in the administration. The first woman vice president of the United States is struggling to find her place in the White House due to strained relations with the members of US President Joe Biden’s team, reported news agency AFP.Several media reports have claimed that Harris's communications director Ashley Etienne will also be leaving.The early exits come at a time when Harris is facing two challenging missions of voting access for minorities and the migration crisis on the southern border. After taking over the Oval Office in January, Biden asked Harris to become a champion of voting rights even as the passage of any such legislation in Congress remains a remote prospect. She has been handed over the job of resolving the migration crisis at the southern border, an issue that several of Biden’s predecessors have failed to address.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-kamala-harris-getting-sidelined-in-biden-administration-what-we-know-so-far-101638582027642.html

We need to be prepared and cautious, not panic, because we’re in a different situation to a year ago.”Delta accounts for 99% of infections around the world. This variant would have to be more transmissible to outcompete and become dominant worldwide. It is possible, but it’s not possible to predict.”We need to wait, lets hope it’s milder... but it’s too early to conclude about the variant as a whole,” Swaminathan said.WHO’s emergencies director, Mike Ryan, said there was no evidence to support a change in vaccines to tailor them to Omicron. “Right now, we have highly effective vaccines that are working. We need to focus on getting them more equitably distributed. We need to focus on getting people most at risk vaccinated,” Ryan said at a social media event.“I have not seen reports of Omicron-related deaths yet,” WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said separately.‘Some cases in people who came from Europe’Botswana’s President Mokg-weetsi Masisi said some of the four diplomats who first tested positive for the Omicron coronavirus variant in the country had come from Europe, calling for a reversal of widespread travel bans imposed against southern African countries.“The diplomats came from a number of countries ... and they passed through a number of countries to get to Botswana.”He declined to disclose their nationalities, only saying “some had been to Europe and some had been elsewhere”.The country has so far reported more than 20 cases of the new variant.Presidential spokesman Batlhalefi Leagajang told Reuters on Friday that Masisi will not disclose the countries the diplomats passed through, or their countries of origin, because “the virus should never be geo-politicised”.Omicron spreads in United States, AustraliaThe US and Australia announced their first locally transmitted cases of the Omicron variant.Nine cases have been confirmed in France and 10 in the United States. One case each in Hawaii and Minnesota involved residents with no recent international travel history - showing that Omicron is already circulating inside the country.Australia on Friday, too, reported three students had tested positive for the variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-panic-over-new-covid-variant-who-101638581320584.html

"I have a test every day... a Covid test. They check me for all the strains."What I have is a 1 1/2-year-old grandson who had a cold who likes to kiss his pop... but it's just a cold," he added.The arrival of winter hand-in-hand with the emergence of the new Omicron coronavirus variant have raised fears of a potential resurgence of Covid-19 cases, particularly as Americans gather for end-of-year festivities.Biden, 79, spent last week's Thanksgiving holiday with his family.He is the oldest president ever elected in the United States, making his health of particular concern.Earlier in November, he underwent an extensive but routine checkup, after which White House physician Kevin O'Connor said the president was "healthy" and "vigorous."After Biden's public appearance on Friday, O'Connor confirmed that Biden "is experiencing some increased nasal congestion this week.""This can be heard in his voice and he is feeling the colloquially well-known 'frog in ones throat'," the doctor said in a statement released by the White House.O'Connor said the president had been tested for 19 common respiratory diseases, including three tests this week for Covid-19, and that all the tests were negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-am-okay-just-a-cold-says-biden-with-hoarse-voic-as-omicron-variant-spreads-in-us-101638578404866.html

04-12-2021||World||Why Omicron infection possibly looks like common cold, researchers explain||The symptoms of the Omicron variant are apparently milder than the earlier variants as the variant is making itself look "more human". This is a result of the mutation, during which it has picked up a snippet of genetic material from another virus, probably a common cold virus, according to researchers. In a study led by Venky Soundararajan of Cambridge, it has been revealed that this mutation might have happened in a cell that can host both SARS-CoV-2 and common cold viruses.What does this finding mean? As Reuters reported, this could mean the virus transmits more easily, while only causing mild or asymptomatic disease. Questions like whether Omicron is more infectious than other variants, whether it causes more severe disease or whether it will overtake Delta as the most prevalent variant are et to be answered as the scientific probe is going on.The new characteristic of Omicron indicates that it might be a result of viral recombination, which is a process in which two different viruses in the same host cell interact while making copies of themselves, generating new copies that have some genetic material from both "parents".According to this study, Omicron could have occurred in a person infected with both pathogens where a version of SARS-CoV-2 picked up the genetic sequence from the other virus and that's why Omicron's genetic sequence does not match with the earlier versions. Neither do the symptoms match with Covid caused by the earlier variants of the virus.The same genetic sequence appears many times in one of the coronaviruses that cause colds in people - known as HCoV-229E - and in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, Soundararajan said.South African scientists have earlier hinted that Omicron was probably incubated in the body of a person whose immune system was affected by HIV or by any other immuno-compromising condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-omicron-infection-possibly-looks-like-common-cold-researchers-explain-101638578866919.html
04-12-2021||World||WHO says no Omicron deaths yet, as variant spreads worldwide||The Omicron variant has been detected in 38 countries but no deaths have yet been reported, the WHO said on Friday, as authorities worldwide rushed to stem the heavily mutated Covid-19 strain's spread amid warnings that it could damage the global economic recovery.The United States and Australia became the latest countries to confirm locally transmitted cases of the variant, as Omicron infections pushed South Africa's total cases past three million.The World Health Organization has warned it could take weeks to determine how infectious the variant is, whether it causes more severe illness and how effective treatments and vaccines are against it."We're going to get the answers that everybody out there needs," WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said.The WHO said on Friday it had still not seen any reports of deaths related to Omicron, but the new variant's spread has led to warnings that it could cause more than half of Europe's Covid cases in the next few months.The new variant could also slow global economic recovery, just as the Delta strain did, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva said on Friday."Even before the arrival of this new variant, we were concerned that the recovery, while it continues, is losing somewhat momentum," she said."A new variant that may spread very rapidly can dent confidence."A preliminary study by researchers in South Africa, where the variant was first reported on November 24, suggests it is three times more likely to cause reinfections compared to the Delta or Beta strains.The emergence of Omicron was the "ultimate evidence" of the danger of unequal global vaccination rates, Red Cross head Francesca Rocca said.South African doctors said there had been a spike in children under five admitted to hospital since Omicron emerged, but stressed it was too early to know if young children were particularly susceptible."The incidence in those under-fives is now second-highest, and second only to the incidence in those over 60," said Wassila Jassat from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases.In the US, two cases involved residents with no recent international travel history -- showing Omicron is already circulating inside the country."This is a case of community spread," the Hawaii Health Department said.US President Joe Biden on Thursday unveiled his plans to battle Covid-19 during the winter, with new testing requirements for travellers and a surge in vaccination efforts.'Kick in the nuts'All incoming travellers will need to test negative within a day of their flights, and rapid tests that cost $25 will be covered by insurance and distributed free to the uninsured.Australia on Friday reported three students in Sydney had tested positive for the variant, despite a ban on non-citizens entering the country and restrictions on flights from southern Africa, with multiple countries rushing to limit travel from the region in the past week."It's quite a kick in the nuts," said Sabine Stam, who runs a South African tour company and whose customers are demanding refunds. "Everyone is too scared to set a new travel date," she said.In Norway, officials said at least 13 people who contracted Covid-19 after an office Christmas party in Oslo last week had the Omicron variant -- though so far they have only had mild symptoms, city health official Tine Ravlo told AFP.But the government ushered in restrictions in greater Oslo after fears of the cluster surfaced.On Friday, Malaysia also reported a first Omicron infection in a foreign student arriving from South Africa on November 19. Sri Lanka also announced its first case, a citizen returning from South Africa.Russia's federal statistics agency Rosstat, meanwhile, said that nearly 75,000 people died of coronavirus in the country in October, making it the deadliest month of the pandemic.Snogging discouragedThe new variant poses a major challenge to ending the pandemic.Rising Delta cases had already forced European governments to reintroduce mandatory mask-wearing, social distancing, curfews or lockdowns, leaving businesses fearing another grim Christmas.Belgian authorities said on Friday that primary schools would close a week early for the Christmas holidays.Germany's regional leaders agreed new measures including a ban on fireworks at new year parties to discourage large gatherings.Ireland said it will close nightclubs and reintroduce social distancing in some settings over Christmas and the New Year.In the UK, ministers have been expressing divergent opinions, not only on the idea of hosting parties, but also on the kind of conduct deemed acceptable."For what it's worth, I don't think there should be much snogging under the mistletoe," said one minister, Therese Coffey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-no-omicron-deaths-yet-as-variant-spreads-worldwide-101638573128942.html

Then Burness started feeling stomach cramps. Her 12-year-old daughter was nauseous.“It was just getting worse every day,” said Burness, whose husband is in the Navy.Their family is among hundreds of military families living near Pearl Harbor with similar complaints amid concerns the Navy's water system may have been contaminated by a fuel leak. The problems have afflicted one of the most important Navy bases in the world, home to submarines, ships and the commander of US forces in the Indo-Pacific region. The issues may even threaten one of Honolulu's most important aquifers and water sources.This week, the state Department of Health said a sample of Navy tap water from an elementary school had tested positive for petroleum product. The Navy says its water samples haven't shown the presence of fuel. But Hawaii's public health officials have told people using Navy water — some 93,000 people — not to drink it. Navy water users who smell a fuel or chemical odor should not use their water for showering, laundry or washing dishes, they said.Neither the Navy nor the state has identified where the fuel or fuel odor is coming from. They are investigating.But on Nov. 22, the Navy said a water and fuel mixture had leaked into a fire suppression system drain line in a tunnel at a massive fuel storage facility 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) inland of Pearl Harbor. The Navy said it removed about 14,000 gallons (53 kiloliters) of the mixture, and said the liquid hadn’t leaked into the environment.In the days after Thanksgiving, Burness’s daughter felt so sick she didn’t want to eat any leftovers, including potatoes, turnips and carrots that had been boiled in water.“‘I don’t want you to have to throw out food because I know it’s expensive, but I can’t eat this Mom,’” Burness said her daughter told her.On Sunday, Burness started seeing comments on social media from military families saying their tap water smelled like fuel. She didn’t smell it, but people told her to turn on her hot water and check. She did and smelled it too.She told her family not to drink the water and not to wash their hair and face with it. She ordered private water delivery for $120 a month. They family has mostly been eating off of plastic and paper plates and eating out.On Monday, when she gave her dog some bottled water, he immediately drank a full liter's worth and then drank two more liters over the next 12 hours.The Navy has since starting distributing bottled water.Burness said her stomach cramps are about 85% better, but not fully. Her daughter's nausea has improved. But they are both now complaining of breathing issues.Burness has been frustrated with the Navy's response, which she believes has been dismissive of families' concerns. She pointed to a Monday email from the commander of Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam that told residents the Navy was testing water samples but it had no immediate indication the water wasn't safe. His email said he and his staff were drinking the water.“All they had to do was say; ‘We see that there’s a problem, we don’t know what it is and we’re going to do whatever it takes to find out and fix it.’ That’s all they had to do. And instead, we got: ‘Nope. Looks good. Smells fine. Bye,'” Burness said.Navy Region Hawaii, which oversees all Navy installations in the state, said the commander's email was sent when “numbers of concerns were still very low.”“Since then, the Navy has aggressively increased sampling, testing, communication to families and others impacted, as well as started response teams of experts to address the issues we all are facing,” the command said in a statement.On Thursday, the Army, which houses some Hawaii-based soldiers in the Pearl Harbor area with Navy water, said families could go to a community center for help moving to a hotel or a new home or to talk to a health care professional.The Nov. 22 tunnel leak was only the latest involving the Red Hill Fuel Storage Facility, a complex of 20 underground fuel tanks built during World War II. Environmentalists and Honolulu's municipal water utility have expressed concerns about these aging tanks since the Navy disclosed one of them leaked 27,000 gallons (102 kiloliters) in 2014.The tanks sit 100 feet (30 meters) above an aquifer that supplies about a quarter of the water consumed in Honolulu, prompting concerns that leaks could contaminate one of the city's most crucial water sources.Burness said her experience has shaken her confidence in the military. During her decades as a military spouse, she's always believed in doing whatever it takes to support “the mission.”“This has destroyed all of that,” she said. “I have zero confidence at this point, and I think this has shown that they cannot be trusted with anything."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fuel-in-tap-water-alarms-pearl-harbor-military-families-101638511496195.html
04-12-2021||World||Can’t allow Afghanistan to become a threat to its neighours: EU special envoy||The European Union (EU) wants to see movement on commitments made by the Taliban setup in Kabul, including on humanitarian access, counter-terrorism and the formation of an inclusive government, EU special envoy for Afghanistan Tomas Niklasson said on Friday. In an interview, Niklasson said the EU and India are very close on most issues related to Afghanistan, including the need not to isolate the Afghan people even as there is no recognition of the interim government formed by the Taliban. Edited excerpts:Q. Could we talk about the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, which is the focus of the world community? But it’s a difficult situation as there is no agreement on the unfreezing of Afghan assets around the world, and there are problems in getting the aid across to the Afghan people.A. I think, first of all, Afghanistan is heading towards a rough winter. I should actually correct myself because I’ve been saying this for months – I think today we should say Afghanistan is in a rough winter because winter is already here. The EU, like most partners, has stopped regular development assistance, but at the same time, we see the needs and have multiplied our humanitarian assistance fivefold, from 60 million euros to 300 million euros.Member states have pledged another 400 million euros. My understanding is that this, together with contributions by others, basically responds to the humanitarian appeal that was launched this autumn. But the needs are enormous and the projections for next year are even bigger.You rightly pointed at the problems of getting the money in, the uncertainties about distribution, but the EU is in a good position, to the extent that we had people on the [ground] in Kabul and also expatriate staff working for the European Commission and the EU. They don’t distribute the aid. We do that through UN organisations and NGOs, never through the government. And the other advantage is that we have worked in Afghanistan and provided humanitarian assistance for the last 20 years, so it’s not new territory to us.We have also been working in areas controlled by the Taliban, again not through the Taliban, but they know who we are. They know what we do. They know the rules of the game and most of the time, they respect the rules of the game.Q. What about the unfreezing of Afghan assets? Do you see that happening?A. I think it’s a complex matter. As we know, the assets are frozen, the bulk of them in the US in banks [but also in] British, German, Swiss and UAE banks. But the largest amount is in the US. These amounts are somehow locked in court cases by victims of 9/11 and Americans who gave their lives in Afghanistan.And then there is the issue of who actually owns this money. Is it the government which isn’t recognised? Is it the Afghan people? Is it the donors because a lot of it presumably would have come from partners who contributed 75% to the national budget.The third question is these are reserves. They’re not meant to be used to prop up the budget. They’re there to guarantee the stability of a currency. You may call that a luxury if you’re starving, but that...just keeps adding to the difficulties and I don’t see solutions.However, we understand there are discussions going on. I think there are people in the US working to see that some of this money could be released in some form. But I don’t know how quickly or how much. And then an additional challenge would then be to whom should it go?Would there be a way through UN-led trust funds or a World Bank trust, or for example, to use part of this money for humanitarian or basic needs. I don’t have an answer, but I know the discussion is going on and I’m not hopeful that there would be a major breakthrough soon, but I hope that part of it can contribute to the solution.Q. You had several meetings in New Delhi and there have been efforts to align the position of different key players in Afghanistan. Was there some convergence with India? Are we on the same page and what were the main areas of your discussions?A. India and the EU are far away geographically and they’re very different entities with a different history and different geography. But we have found in recent years a strong convergence or even an overlap, to a large extent, in our positions when it comes to Afghanistan. We talked about “Afghan-owned and Afghan-led”, we had the same principles when it came to human rights and rights of women and girls, the call for the Afghan people to shape their own future. This was confirmed shortly before the EU-India Summit in spring in a joint declaration by your minister of external affairs and the EU high representative, vice president Josep Borrell.Since then, I have been in regular contact with my counterparts at the ministry here and we have compared notes as things changed very dramatically in Afghanistan. I’m pleased to see that we have not moved away and my visit confirms that we are very close on many issues.I thought perhaps before my visit that India would be even more focused on the security aspects and that would be very understandable. There is a focus on security but I also find that there is quite a lot of similarity. Neither Europe nor India wants to isolate Afghanistan. None of us wants to isolate the Afghan people, [and] none of us is ready to recognise the interim government. But we both, in different ways, try to see that dialogue in some form is still needed. We both focus on humanitarian assistance as a first and immediate priority.And we both see it as important that countries in the region, including India, Iran and [the] Central Asia [states], and countries further afield such as Russia, the US and the EU work together in defining what we expect from Afghanistan and try to influence a change for the better in the country.Q. Before coming to India, you met a Taliban delegation in Doha and a statement issued after the talks started by saying that the meeting didn’t imply any sort of recognition. It’s quite clear that nobody is moving towards recognition of the Taliban right now.A. It is clear that no one has gone for recognition right now. It is also clear that many of us engage and have a dialogue. I think from that point of view, it was useful to point it out in the statement that this doesn’t constitute recognition. I think recognition is a tricky term and it has a legal meaning and we can always come back and say, we do not actually work with those governments, we recognise states. But what about when the nature of the state which has changed from an Islamic republic to we do not know what is it. But you know, these are diplomatic niceties.I think what we mean is this is not a government that has come to power in a legitimate manner. This is a government that has revoked the constitution, that has broken its promises in terms of negotiating an agreement, a government that is unclear about its international obligations, that calls on its partners not to isolate Afghanistan, but at the same time sends signals that put us in doubt on whether they want to engage with us.So this is the background...and this is why there is no recognition, but yet at the same time, the Taliban or interim government, whatever we call it...they are the reality for now. We see it as more in our interest to have a dialogue or try a dialogue than to close doors.Q. It’s very clear the Taliban haven’t delivered on commitments made during their negotiations with the US or under UN Security Council resolution 2593. There are clearly things that they need to do.A. There are clearly things they need to do, and we could sit quietly in our corners in Delhi or in Brussels and wait for them to do it. We think there is a higher probability that they may do at least some of those things if we talk to them. If we find after two months, four months, six months, whatever the time may be, that they are not moving at all, the appetite for engaging will be less, I don’t mean everything will be delivered in six months and there may be different timescales for some of the things we want, but we want to see movement. We want to see the process, but the process also leading to results. And as long as that happens, I think we are ready to continue the dialogue.Q. Could you pinpoint some of the issues you raised with the Taliban in Doha?A. We talked about humanitarian access, issues such as taxation of humanitarian assistance, which they committed not to do. They underlined, as we did, the importance of having women contributing to humanitarian assistance, assessing needs, reaching out to people, and delivering assistance. They made a commitment to what we call safe passage. It is not about opening the borders for everybody to leave the country, but Afghans who are under threat Afghans who may have worked in sensitive positions before, maybe Afghans who worked with Indian development or European projects and feel threatened and want to leave. They should be allowed to leave and there’s a commitment on that.We talked about human rights, a lot needs to be done. We talked about girls’ education, where there’s a strong commitment now at least on paper...[with] the government saying it is a policy of the Islamic emirate, as they refer to themselves, that girls should have access to school.This is not what we heard a few months and certainly not two decades ago. This needs to be translated, it needs to happen throughout the country. Those are some of the things we talked about. Where I see less movement is on inclusivity, of having a government representing minorities or ethnic communities, a government having women or a government representing different political affiliations.And we try to explain to the Taliban [that they] want international recognition, but you also need domestic recognition. If that doesn’t come, there’s a risk that history repeats itself. The winner takes it all and then after a decade or two, loses it all.Q. Three security-related issues that are a concern are the Taliban’s failure to cut ties to terror groups, an increase in drug production, and the rise of Islamic State-Khorasan. What are the EU’s view on this?A. Afghanistan cannot [and] must not be allowed to become a threat to its neighbours or to other countries. And this is not something we are waiting to see happen. It takes decisions, it takes action from the de facto authorities.When it comes to drug production, I think it’s a mixed history. We have seen over the last two decades a very substantial increase in production. It’s debatable to what extent it was driven by the Taliban or they benefited from some of the “taxes” on production and smuggling.Anyway, it was part of their income...We hear reports that production or smuggling is increasing. We now have the Taliban controlling the borders. So that’s a worrying sign, but we know that drug production provides livelihood for many Afghans...To be able to address it, they will need to find other alternative crops.When it comes to ISIS-K, they are active...and figures vary and there are discussions about, is it one movement? Is it a set of different movements of people moving from one to the other? I see a few risks. First of all, [there is] the risk [or] the potential of the breeding ground, if you like. The market for recruiting fighters will be there. We have disgruntled or disappointed Taliban who have known for months or years, or sometimes longer, how to use a gun. And suddenly they’re more or less out of a job. They don’t have a salary or a function or belonging. We need to add some kind of purpose in life.I don’t want to exaggerate it but we have members of the former Afghan national security forces who certainly know how to use a gun or some of them would certainly hold a grudge against the Taliban. And some of them would certainly be looking for an income. I would link this to two things – the humanitarian situation because if winter gets harsh [and] if the economy deteriorates even further, and if the interim government is not seen as delivering and being more representative than it is now, there is a bad old tradition in Afghanistan of having a fighting season starting in the spring.One of many question marks when it comes to Afghanistan is the financing of Daesh. And I don’t have the answers to that but it seems that they have the ability to recruit, and that they continue doing so.Q. Two of the most important players in this region, India and Pakistan, clearly have different views on Afghanistan. Is that coming in the way of trying to put together some sort of regional consensus? Is this something that worries you?A. It does worry me. I mean if I try to be an optimist for a moment, what I see is at some level, a convergence of views between India and Pakistan on what they say they want out of Afghanistan. We come back to some of the issues we talked about – an inclusive and stable government, human rights, not threatening its neighbours.I think the positive element I see is overall convergence at a rather abstract level. But there is a fundamental lack of trust. As we know from history… the Pakistani version of the story is very much that they have generously been hosting maybe four million refugees, some of them for decades, that the country has been greatly affected by terrorist attacks, and you have figures they quote of 70,000 or 80,000 people being killed, But you also hear another story which is presented by India and others about part of the military so-called establishment, in particular ISI, actively recruiting madrassa students, hosting leaders of various shuras in Pakistan, pulling the strings, calling the shots, and even having played a significant role in putting the current government in place with a very large number of Haqqani Network [members]. Pakistani authorities claim they have lost some influence. Some Indian observers would probably laugh them in the face and say we saw what happened in Kabul. I think what I would hope to see is that there could be some convergence not only of views but also of action.I’m a little bit sceptical about precisely the role India and Pakistan together can play. What I see as hopeful is regional formats, and some formats where both countries are brought together, the discussions in Moscow for example, and hopefully we think sometimes it’s easier to solve issues or not to focus too much on bilateral tensions. If you try to solve things in a larger context, I think that’s also the European experience.
