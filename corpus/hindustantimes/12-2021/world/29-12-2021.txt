In the year ahead, I call for leaders of government and industry to walk the talk on vaccine equity."While 2021 has been hard, I ask everyone to make a New Year's resolution to get behind the campaign to vaccinate 70 percent by the middle of 2022."Misinformation and populismTedros slammed the attitude of richer countries accusing them of hogging the weapons to combat Covid-19 -- and leaving the back door open for the virus."Populism, narrow nationalism and hoarding of health tools, including masks, therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines, by a small number of countries, undermined equity, and created the ideal conditions for the emergence of new variants," he said.Meanwhile, disinformation had been a constant distraction in 2021, hampering efforts to beat the pandemic."In the huge waves of cases currently seen in Europe and in many countries around the world, misinformation which has driven vaccine hesitancy is now translating to the unvaccinated disproportionally dying," he said.Tedros lamented that while there were 1.8 million recorded deaths in 2020, there were 3.5 million in 2021 -- and the true number would be much higher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-worries-for-collapse-of-health-systems-over-tsunami-of-covid-cases-101640796528962.html
29-12-2021||World||US hits new record for daily Covid tally since January, logs 265,427 new cases||The United States has reached its highest-ever average of new Covid cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, as the Omicron variant spread at a blistering pace.The moving seven-day average of new cases was 265,427 as of Tuesday, surpassing the previous peak of 251,989 set in mid-January 2021, a tracker maintained by the university showed.Ahead of Johns Hopkins releasing the data, Harvard epidemiologist and immunologist Michael Mina tweeted the count was likely the "tip of the iceberg" with the true number of cases likely far higher, because of a shortage of tests and results from home tests not being included.The heavily-mutated Omicron strain, which according to government modeling accounted for around 59 percent of national US cases in the week ending December 25, is the most transmissible seen to date.It is frequently able to bypass prior immunity conferred by vaccination and prior infection.Though the rate of severe outcomes appears to be lower, Omicron is already overwhelming previously stretched hospital systems throughout the country, with health workers leaving in droves because of burnout.Almost 9,000 patients are being admitted every day, according to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), still some way short of the peak of 16,500 per day seen in January, though this is a lagging indicator.Around 1,200 people were dying on average every day on December 23, the day before data collection was disrupted by Christmas holidays.In January, deaths peaked at an average of 3,400 a day.Experts are hoping the US Omicron wave will be more like a "flash flood" as seen in South Africa, where it was first reported in mid-November but where cases have been receding since more than a week.The latest milestone comes as the CDC shortened recommended times that people should isolate after a positive test from 10 to five days, so long as they do not have symptoms and continue to wear a mask.The move was praised by airlines and the hospitality industry, but public health experts criticized the decision to omit a requirement for a negative Covid test -- even via rapid antigen, which correlates well with infectiousness.More than 820,000 Americans have died from the pandemic, making the United States by far the hardest-hit country in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hits-new-record-for-daily-covid-tally-since-january-logs-265-427-new-cases-101640788867328.html
29-12-2021||World||States in Australia mull putting cats under lockdown. Here's why||Many states in Australia will soon ask cat owners to keep them locked inside their homes, or at least within the premises. The reason? These feline hunters have been hunting hundreds of native animals.According to ABC News, one cat is responsible for more than 180 native animal attacks. It further reported that around 450 native animals, most of them small birds and quendas (a type of bandicoot), are brought the WA Wildlife hospital near Perth each year after an encounter with a cat.The report also mentioned about a boobook owl, who had to be euthanised due to a chip fracture to its elbow joint after a cat encounter. The owl was brought to the hospital by the owner of the cat, who found the injured bird in the pet’s mouth.The doctors said that severity of the injury affected the owl’s ability to fly.The hospital’s operations director Dean Huxley told ABC News that more than 5,000 animals are admitted to the facility each year suffering from injuries consistent with a cat attack.One of the reasons, he said, is he clearing of habitat which leads these animals to areas dominated by cats, thereby resulting in such calamities.So, in order to save endemic wildlife from extinction, the authorities in Australia are implementing “cat curfews”.In Adelaide Hills in South Australia, cats a banned from 8pm to 7am. In other parts of the country, like the city of Greater Bendigo in Victoria, owners have been asked to keep the cats on their properties or face fines.Australia’s capital Canberra plans to place all the cats under lockdown from mid-2022. In Western Australia, Fremantle is leading the push for cat containment, with a proposal to ban cats from all public areas.Cat breeders like Pamela Lanigan agree with government’s move to ban cats in public places. But she points out that much of the harm to wildlife hadn’t been done by pet cats but those which are stray or “loosely owned” by several households.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/states-in-australia-mull-putting-cats-under-lockdown-here-s-why-101640779467981.html

Canada has also crossed the 2mn mark in total infections since the coronavirus crisis commenced in 2020.Meanwhile, as cases increase sharply, many provinces have closed gyms, nightclubs and bars, while other establishments, like restaurants have to operate at 50% capacity. The worst-hit province of Quebec, with 12,833 new cases, is trying to deal with the problem by taking the radical step of allowing some infected healthcare workers to remain at their stations.“If we had the staff we needed, we wouldn’t have to implement this measure,” according to the Montreal Gazette’s translation of Quebec’s health minister Christian Dubé’s remarks in French.He explained the provincial system was in a “vice” where there were more cases while fewer healthcare workers were available. However, the announcement was criticised by unions representing healthcare staff over the measure. Meanwhile, another member of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Cabinet has tested positive for Covid-19. Labour minister Seamus O’Regan tweeted he took a rapid test and tested positive. He will remain in self-isolation. O’Regan’s case may be a breakthrough since he also stated he has received three vaccine doses.Last week, Canada’s foreign minister Melanie Joly had also tested positive, after undergoing a rapid test.As cases reach new highs each day, several provinces, including Quebec, have accelerated their administration of booster doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/driven-by-omicron-variant-canada-in-the-grip-of-rising-covid-cases-101640779344275.html
29-12-2021||World||China recommits to Covid Zero amid surging Xi’an outbreak||Chinese officials renewed their commitment to a zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 even as they battle what is becoming the biggest and most protracted outbreak since the virus emerged in Wuhan two years ago.Health officials vowed not to waver in their efforts to quash any domestic resurgence and to prevent the virus from crossing borders at a briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. The government limited entry into the capital city on Friday for anyone with a travel history to a border county within the previous two weeks, even if there haven’t been any cases in those places. Authorities will act “at the fastest speed and with minimal cost,” said He Qinghua, an official with the National Health Commission.New Covid-19 cases continued to emerge in the western Chinese city of Xi’an, which the government locked down last week. The numbers eased a bit after hitting a record on Tuesday when repeat testing of its 13 million residents identified several previously undetected chains of transmission.Xi’an reported 151 infections on Wednesday, down from 175 on Tuesday, as residents have been asked to stay indoors and driving is banned. The outbreak spread from a few dozen cases in early December to roughly 150 a day after the city was locked down last Thursday, the most dramatic curb China has enacted to stymie Covid since closing off Wuhan and the broader Hubei province in January 2020.Five rounds of mass testing have detected more than 900 infections thus far in Xi’an. The outbreak, which was initially traced to a flight from Pakistan, spread quietly throughout the community in its early days. Its ability to evade detection by contract tracers and to permeate every corner of the city is what led worried officials to enact the lockdown.  China’s Plane-Cleaning Rule Spurs U.S. Talks After Aborted TripThe Xi’an outbreak shows the challenge China faces in eliminating the virus as part of the so-called Covid Zero strategy it has pursued since the start of the pandemic. The approach that features mass testing, aggressive contact tracing, quarantines and sealed borders to prevent infections from seeping in from overseas kept most of the country virus-free throughout the pandemic. It remains the best strategy for China, despite doubts about its economic and emotional costs, said Liang Wannian, the seasoned epidemiologist that overseas the country’s Covid response. His comments came in an interview with the Paper, a Shanghai-based media outlet. Lingering CasesThe arrival of the more contagious delta variant has challenged the status quo by proving capable of slipping through those barriers and triggering more frequent domestic flareups since May this year. The prolonged struggle against delta has raised questions about whether such a containment strategy will hold up against omicron, and even more infectious strain. The emergence of omicron doesn’t mean China will have to change tack, but rather will require more forceful implementation of the current Covid playbook, Liang told the Paper.While China has detected a handful of imported omicron infections from international travellers, the variant has yet to spread domestically. Officials are ramping up defences at border towns by creating so-called buffer zones. Those areas will have more checks and tighter restrictions to reduce the chance of the virus escaping into the community and causing domestic flareups, according to Liang. What Covid Therapies Exist, and What Omicron Changes: QuickTakeExperts warn the latest outbreak won’t be under control until mid to late January, just days before the Winter Olympics begin in the capital Beijing. Earlier this week Xi’an started citywide disinfection, while residents have been asked to stay home and only have one member from each household leave every other day to shop for groceries. Authorities have also suspended all domestic flights and banned private cars on the street.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-recommits-to-covid-zero-amid-surging-xi-an-outbreak-101640772721443.html

It added that acting editor-in-chief Patrick Lam, who was earlier arrested, had resigned and all employees have been terminated."Because of the current situation, Stand News will stop operating immediately," the outlet said in a statement.Steve Li, senior superintendent of the national security police, accused the media outlet of publishing articles that incited hatred towards the Hong Kong government between July 2020 and November 2021, which included news reports and blog posts."They described Hong Kong protesters as 'being disappeared' and 'violated'... These are malicious allegations without any factual basis," Li told a press conference.The seven individuals were arrested under a British colonial-era law for "conspiracy to publish seditious publication".Around lunchtime on Wednesday, national security police could be seen hauling boxes from Stand News' office. Li said they seized computers, phones, documents and HK$500,000 ($64,100) in cash.The national security unit froze about HK$61 million ($7.8 mn) worth of assets from the media outlet, one of the largest sums it has ever frozen, Li said.More than 200 officers were deployed to search the outlet's newsroom with court authorisation to seize journalistic materials, police said.An AFP reporter saw Stand News' Lam being led handcuffed into the office after his arrest.Police also arrested former editor-in-chief Chung Pui-kuen, as well as four board members who resigned in June, according to local media.Li would not rule out further arrests, and said some individuals not in Hong Kong had been put on a wanted list.'Editorially independent'Announcing its closure, Stand News thanked its readers, saying it was established as a non-profit in December 2014 to "take a stand in Hong Kong"."Stand News was editorially independent, and was dedicated to protecting Hong Kong's core values such as democracy, human rights, freedom, rule of law and justice," the outlet said.The Committee to Protect Journalists described the raid as "an open assault on Hong Kong's already tattered press freedom" and called for charges to be dropped.Stand News is the second Hong Kong media company targeted by the authorities after Apple Daily, which shut down in June after its assets were frozen under the national security law.Li denied that police were targeting reporters and the media, saying that news outlets will not face the law in Hong Kong if their journalists write "unbiased" reports.Shortly before dawn, Stand News broadcast live on Facebook that national security police were outside the door of deputy assignment editor Ronson Chan, who had several devices confiscated but was not arrested.The former Stand News board members arrested Wednesday are Hong Kong pop star Denise Ho, barrister Margaret Ng, Christine Fang and Chow Tat-chi, according to local media reports.Li confirmed to AFP that, in addition to the arrests, police visited and searched the homes of four people connected to Stand News.International outcryDuring the 2019 democracy protests, police clashed with several of the outlet's reporters while one journalist -- known for her Facebook live broadcasts -- captured footage of a mob attack at a train station, continuing the feed even as the assailants turned on her.Hong Kong has long served as a regional media hub, though it has tumbled down press freedom rankings in recent years as Beijing asserts greater control over the city.Following reports of Wednesday's raid, Taiwan's ruling party accused Beijing of destroying Hong Kong's democracy and freedom.The Hong Kong Journalists Association and the Foreign Correspondents' Club -- representing local and international media workers respectively -- both said they were "deeply concerned" by the arrests and called for press freedom to be respected.Meanwhile, exiled activist Nathan Law tweeted that the arrests illustrated the persecution of journalists and media that "dare to challenge them and speak the truth".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-stand-news-shuts-down-after-police-raid-arrests-101640767460719.html

Petersen said in a post last week that he had been learning about McDonald’s struggle with french fry shortages in the country. McDonald’s Holdings Co. Japan said Dec. 21 that it would only offer small sizes of french fries after flooding at a Vancouver port and the Covid-19 pandemic cut off key supplies for the staple menu item. Footage from a local television report showed customers forming long lines at one of the stores in Tokyo to get their last orders of the larger portion fries before the ration went into effect.The fast-food company has said it expects the issue to be resolved by New Year’s Eve and that it was arranging alternative shipment options like airplanes. McDonald’s Holdings Co. Japan couldn’t confirm or deny it’s using Flexport to import its potatoes. The sale of medium and large size fries will resume as planned on Dec. 31, a spokeswoman said by telephone on Wednesday. Flexport’s Petersen didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The shortage isn’t just limited to Japan. In New York, iconic burger joint J.G. Melon said in an Instagram post last week that it was suspending sales of its cottage fries due to supply-chain issues. Flow of products from cream cheese to chicken tenders has also come under strain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-planes-to-fly-potatoes-to-ease-japan-s-french-fries-deficiency-101640766976503.html

Others included in the list were - Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, Turkish President Recip Tayyip Erdogan, and disgraced Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz, reported OCCRP.OCCRP said Ghani deserved an award because he "deserted his people leaving them to misery and death."Drew Sullivan, a co-founder of OCCRP who served as a judge on the panel, said that Ashraf Ghani deserves such an award due to his corruption and incompetence."Ghani certainly deserves an award, too. He was breath-taking in both his corruption and his gross incompetence. He deserted his people, leaving them to misery and death so he could live among the corrupt former state officials in the moral cesspool that is the UAE," said Sullivan.A panel of six journalists and scholars who study and report on corruption selected Lukashenko as the man of the year. It included Rawan Damen, Director General of Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ); Will Fitzgibbon, senior reporter with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ); Boyoung Lim, a senior editor at the Pulitzer Center; Louise Shelley, an author and endowed professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University; Paul Radu, award-winning cross-border investigative reporter, co-founder, and Director of OCCRP; and Drew Sullivan."It was a banner year for corruption, but Lukashenko stood out from the crowd," said Sullivan.Lukashenko, 67, has clung to power in Minsk since 1993, rigging elections, torturing critics, and arresting and beating protesters, all with the aid and approval of the Kremlin, reported OCCRP.Assad led Syria into a destructive civil war and has stolen hundreds of millions of dollars while clinging to power. Erdogan has overseen a corrupt government that has laundered Chinese funds for Iranian oil using state-owned banks.

The active cases stand at 10,186.The daily cases have been surging in the Middle Eastern country since last Sunday. On Tuesday, 1,846 more people were detected as Covid-19 positive while one patient died and 632 recovered from the viral disease.At the start of this month, daily cases were below the 50-mark.The UAE so far managed to avoid Covid-19 restrictions unlike other countries in the world.According to Bloomberg, the country has started administering booster doses to its population but has only covered a little over 30%. This booster administration is low despite the UAE having a high vaccination rate globally.Meanwhile, another country in the Middle East, Oman, has made two doses of vaccination mandatory for entering public places, offices. According to a report by Onmanorama, this mandate also applies to foreigners above 18 years that are entering Oman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/abu-dhabi-tightens-entry-requirements-amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases-in-uae-101640760389978.html
29-12-2021||World||Antibodies that can block Omicron variant identified: Report||Scientists have identified antibodies that neutralise Omicron and other variants of coronavirus by targeting areas that remain essentially unchanged as the virus mutates.The research, published in the journal Nature, may help design vaccines and antibody treatments that will be effective against not only Omicron but other variants that may emerge in the future."This finding tells us that by focusing on antibodies that target these highly conserved sites on the spike protein, there is a way to overcome the virus' continual evolution," said David Veesler, an associate professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine in the US.The Omicron variant has an unusually high number of 37 mutations in the spike protein, which the virus uses to enter and infect the human cells.It is thought that these changes explain in part why the variant has been able to spread so rapidly, to infect people who have been vaccinated and to reinfect those who have previously been infected."The main questions we were trying to answer were: how has this constellation of mutations in the spike protein of the Omicron variant affected its ability to bind to cells and to evade the immune system's antibody responses," Veesler said.To assess the effect of these mutations, the researchers engineered a disabled, nonreplicating virus, called a pseudovirus, to produce spike proteins on its surface, as coronaviruses do.They then created pseudoviruses that had spike proteins with the Omicron mutations and those found on the earliest variants identified in the pandemic.The researchers first looked to see how well the different versions of the spike protein were able to bind to protein on the surface of cells, that the virus uses to latch onto and enter the cell. This protein is called the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor.They found the Omicron variant spike protein was able to bind 2.4 times better than spike protein found in the virus isolated at the very beginning of the pandemic."That is not a huge increase but in the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003, mutations in the spike protein that increased affinity were associated with higher transmissibility and infectivity," Veesler noted.They also found that the Omicron version was able to bind to mouse ACE2 receptors efficiently, suggesting Omicron might be able to "ping-pong" between humans and other mammals.The researchers then looked at how well antibodies against earlier isolates of the virus protected against the Omicron variant.They did this by using antibodies from patients who had previously been infected with earlier versions of the virus, vaccinated against earlier strains of the virus, or had been infected and then vaccinated.The team found that antibodies from people who had been infected by earlier strains and from those who had received one of the six most-used vaccines currently available all had reduced ability to block infection.Antibodies from people who had been infected, recovered, and then had two doses of vaccine also had reduced activity, but the reduction was less, about fivefold, clearly demonstrating that vaccination after infection is useful.Antibodies from people, in this case a group of renal dialysis patients, who had received a booster with a third dose of the mRNA vaccines produced by Moderna and Pfizer showed only a 4-fold reduction in neutralising activity."This shows that a third dose is really, really helpful against Omicron," Veesler said.All but one antibody treatments currently authorised or approved to be used with patients exposed to the virus, had no or had markedly reduced activity against Omicron in the laboratory.The exception was an antibody called sotrovimab, which had a two- to three-fold reduction of neutralising activity, the researchers said.However, when they tested a larger panel of antibodies that have been generated against earlier versions of the virus, the researchers identified four classes of antibodies that retained their ability to neutralise Omicron.Members of each of these classes target one of four specific areas of the spike protein present in not only SARS-CoV-2 variants but also a group of related coronaviruses, called sarbecoviruses.These sites on the protein may persist because they play an essential function that the protein would lose if they mutated. Such areas are called "conserved."The finding that antibodies are able to neutralise via recognition of conserved areas in so many different variants of the virus suggests that designing vaccines and antibody treatments that target these regions could be effective against a broad spectrum of variants, Veesler added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antibodies-that-can-block-omicron-variant-identified-report-101640762505870.html

Footage from public broadcaster NHK showed Tokyo's main airports were packed, while public highway data showed a 39 km (24 mile) traffic jam heading southwest of the capital.Officials in Osaka confirmed five Omicron cases at a nursing home, believed to be the first cluster of the variant in Japan, Kyodo news agency reported on Tuesday.Community transmission of Omicron has been found in eight prefectures so far, according to a Jiji news agency tally. The variant may comprise 90% of COVID-19 cases in Osaka by early next month, according to a projection released on Tuesday by Kyoto University professor Hiroshi Nishiura.Concerns that Omicron may be more infectious and evade vaccine protections have prompted Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to accelerate Japan's booster shot programme and maintain some of the world's strictest border restrictions.New COVID-19 infections have ticked up in recent weeks, reaching 385 nationwide on Tuesday. Even so, serious cases and deaths have stayed low, aided by a vaccination push that has fully inoculated almost 80% of the population.Japan has seen just 28 COVID-19 related fatalities in December, on course for the lowest monthly tally since July 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-prepares-for-omicron-spread-with-the-onset-of-new-year-s-week-101640760587003.html
29-12-2021||World||Asia takes precautions against Omicron, but a surge may be inevitable||Much of Asia has largely managed to keep omicron at bay even as the variant rages in other parts of the world, but the region that is home to most of the globe's population is bracing for what may be an inevitable surge.Strict quarantine rules for arrivals and widespread mask wearing have helped slow the spread of the highly contagious variant in Asia. Countries such as Japan, South Korea and Thailand quickly reinstated entry and quarantine restrictions in recent weeks after relaxing them in the fall.But cases are mounting, and experts say the next few months will be critical. Those fears have been amplified by doubts about the effectiveness of the Chinese-made vaccines used in China and much of the developing world.“Once the pace picks up, its upsurge would be extremely fast," said Dr. Shigeru Omi, a top medical adviser to Japan's government.In India, which has been getting back to normal after a devastating COVID-19 outbreak earlier this year, omicron is once again raising fears, with more than 700 cases reported in the country of nearly 1.4 billion people.Australia is already dealing with multiple COVID-19 surges, with a state leader saying Wednesday that “omicron is moving too quickly."Elsewhere, Thailand has topped 700 cases, South Korea has more than 500 and Japan, over 300. China, which has some of the strictest virus controls in the world, has reported at least eight.Only four cases have been reported in the Philippines, where people flocked to shopping malls ahead of Christmas and to Mass in the biggest Roman Catholic nation in Asia. Some hospitals have even begun dismantling COVID-19 wards in a move experts say could prove to be premature.Japan managed to delay the spread of the new variant for about a month largely thanks to its reimposition of entry restrictions, mandatory COVID-19 tests for all arrivals and the isolation of all passengers on a flight if anyone tested positive for omicron.But the barrier was broken last week when the first locally transmitted cases were confirmed in the neighboring cities of Osaka and Kyoto. Experts are urging the government to prepare for an imminent wave of infections by increasing testing, speeding up booster shots and preparing more beds at hospitals.“We want to believe the omicron cases could be mild, but its fast-paced infections could quickly multiply the number of patients and could still overwhelm hospitals,” Omi said.Taiwan, where wearing a face mask is near universal in major cities, has started to offer booster shots of the Moderna vaccine and is urging people get a third shot before an expected influx of people returning home for Lunar New Year at the end of January.Preliminary research has shown that booster shots of the Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines offer continued, though diminished, protection against omicron.However, a Hong Kong University study that has yet to be published found that China's widely used Sinovac vaccine does not generate enough antibodies to protect against omicron, even with a booster shot, according to a university news release. Hong Kong offers both the Sinovac and Pfizer vaccines.Sinovac did not respond to a request for comment. Chinese officials have said their vaccines are still effective.“Our inactivated vaccines are still rather reliable and cover a range of antigens. Therefore, they won't be completely ineffective against omicron,” Zhong Nanshan, a top government doctor, said at a public forum.Some countries that relied on the Chinese vaccines are turning to others for boosters.Thailand, which largely used Sinovac and Sinopharm, another Chinese vaccine, is offering booster shots of AstraZeneca or Pfizer. Indonesia, where Sinovac has been the mainstay of a campaign to vaccinate its 270 million residents, is offering a Moderna booster for health care workers. The government is also planning boosters for the general population in January, though it hasn't said which vaccine.China's attitude toward the virus, omicron or not, is to stop transmission in its tracks, and the country appears to be getting even tougher with the approach of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February.Officials locked down the city of Xi'an, a city and administrative area of 13 million people last week, amid a delta outbreak that has infected hundreds of people. On Monday, they ordered everyone to stay at home until another citywide round of testing was completed.Residents complained on social media about the sudden ban. Many were relying on instant noodles and other packaged food. Some worried how they would get enough food in the coming days, especially fresh vegetables.China quarantines those arriving from abroad for weeks, depending on the province, with three weeks being the most common.How China's zero-COVID-19 policy will play out at the Olympics is a major question. Athletes and visitors will not be allowed to leave the Olympic zones, and those attending such as officials, journalists and venue staff will be tested every day.To contain a deadly delta-driven surge in South Korea, the government this month restored its toughest distancing rules with a four-person limit on private gatherings and a 9 p.m. curfew on restaurants.Health experts predict it's only a matter of time before omicron comes.“Omicron has such a high transmission rate that it's too obvious that it'll become the dominant variant in South Korea at some point,” said Jaehun Jung, a professor at Gachon University College of Medicine in South Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asia-takes-precautions-against-omicron-but-a-surge-may-be-inevitable-101640758930174.html
29-12-2021||World||Omicron spread: Global Covid-19 cases top 1 million for second straight day||The Omicron variant of coronavirus has pushed the global cases of Covid-19 to above one million for second straight day, news agency Bloomberg reported. The world has been grappling with the coronavirus disease for two years now, but there has been little relief. And the Omicron variant threatens to bring back lockdown-like situation again.The first day when global tally topped the million mark was Monday. More than 1.44 million Covid-19 cases were recorded across the world, which smashed the prior record after factoring out a day in December 2020 when Turkey backdated a significant number of cases.The Covid-19 infection is surging across the United States, which recorded nearly half of the million cases across the world in the last 24 hours. California is the worst hit region in the US, recording 86,000 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours.An outbreak of Omicron exploded in Australia too, which saw record hospitalisations. New infections in Sydney and surrounding parts of New South Wales state skyrocketed to more than 11,000, up from 6,000 a day earlier. Victoria state also reported a record 3,700 cases, up by more than 1,000 from the previous record set on Tuesday.This prompted Prime Minister Scott Morrison to schedule an emergency national cabinet meeting.China has already locked down Xian over rise in Covid-19 cases. The 13 million people in the city have not been able to leave their homes for a week and are virtually dependent on deliveries of necessities.Xian reported 151 domestically transmitted infections with confirmed symptoms for Tuesday, or nearly all of the 152 cases nationwide, bringing the total number of local Xian cases to nearly 1,000 during the Dec. 9-28 period. No cases of the Omicron variant have been announced in the city.France reported a record high of 179,807 new confirmed coronavirus cases in a 24-hour period on Tuesday, one of the highest one-day tallies worldwide since the start of the pandemic.It is the highest number of new daily infections in Europe, according to data on covidtracker.fr.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-spread-global-covid-19-cases-top-1-million-for-second-straight-day-101640758495572.html
29-12-2021||World||China: Covid rules lead fugitive to surrender after three years||A Chinese man sought by the police for three years turned himself in after being unable to withstand the restrictions on life amid the government’s Covid-19 curbs.A 42-year-old man gave himself up to the local police in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou on Dec. 24 after he suffered severe travel restrictions because he didn’t have a health code, according to a report posted on Hangzhou police’s WeChat account Tuesday. The man was involved in a racketeering case and escaped from the police in 2018, the report said, without giving his name.Confined to a hiding place, the man experienced increased mental stress and deteriorating health, the report said. He is in criminal detention now.China launched a Covid contact-tracing mechanism across the country early in the pandemic, and continues to use stringent measures that include mass testing, traffic control and targeted lockdowns to contain the virus. A data-based “health code” system installed on residents’ mobile phones shows whether someone is at risk of being infected, thus cannot travel across regions or enter public areas. Local authorities in eastern China’s Zhejiang province, where Hangzhou is located, and neighboring Shanghai tightened Covid prevention rules after a Covid resurgence hit the area in November. This isn’t the first time China’s Covid-control measures brought in a fugitive. A 48-year-old man from the western province of Gansu reported himself to Hangzhou police last year, citing restrictions on his activities without an identification card and health code, the China News Service reported on May 5, 2020. The man had fled police 24 years earlier for suspected homicide, according to the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-covid-rules-lead-fugitive-to-surrender-after-three-years-101640756290960.html
29-12-2021||World||Omicron ravages US, Europe but Asia manages to slow the spread. Here's how||The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has been wreaking havoc in many parts of the world, especially the United States and Europe. In the US and the United Kingdom, it is already the dominant strain, overthrowing Delta.The US recorded more than 500,000 cases in a single day on Tuesday, the highest single-day spike since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. The total cases have exceeded 54 million.Europe too has been grappling with rising Covid-19 cases due to fast-spreading Omicron variant. The heavily-mutated strain is believed to be more resistant to existing vaccines.Also Read | Omicron risk remains high; variant surpasses Delta in UK, US: 7 things WHO saysBut Asia has been able to keep Omicron at bay so far. How has it managed to do so?Strict quarantine rules for arrivals and widespread mask wearing have helped slow the spread of the highly contagious variant in Asia. Countries such as Japan, South Korea and Thailand quickly reinstated entry and quarantine restrictions in recent weeks after relaxing them in the fall.Thailand has 700 cases, South Korea has more than 500 and Japan, over 300. China, which has some of the strictest virus controls in the world, has reported at least eight.Only four cases have been reported in the Philippines, where people flocked to shopping malls ahead of Christmas and to Mass in the biggest Roman Catholic nation in Asia.Taiwan, where wearing a face mask is near universal in major cities, has started to offer booster shots of the Moderna vaccine and is urging people get a third shot before an expected influx of people returning home for Lunar New Year at the end of January.The situation in IndiaIn India has been getting back to normal after a devastating Covid-19 outbreak earlier this year. Though the Omicron cases are rising in the country, it is still below the alarming levels in other parts of the world. So far, more than 700 Omicron cases have been reported in the country of nearly 1.4 billion people.Like other Asian countries, India too has implemented strict measures to check Omicron’s spread. National capital Delhi has banned large gatherings for Christmas and New Year’s, and many other states have announced new restrictions, including curfews and vaccination requirements at stores and restaurants.A surge maybe inevitableSince Asia is home to most of the globe’s population, experts say the surge in Covid-19 cases is inevitable. Cases are mounting across Asia, though slowly than other regions, and experts say the next few months will be critical.Those fears have been amplified by doubts about the effectiveness of the Chinese-made vaccines used in China and much of the developing world.“Once the pace picks up, its upsurge would be extremely fast," said Dr Shigeru Omi, a top medical adviser to Japan’s government.Japan managed to delay the spread of the new variant for about a month largely thanks to its reimposition of entry restrictions, mandatory Covid-19 tests for all arrivals and the isolation of all passengers on a flight if anyone tested positive for omicron.But the barrier was broken last week when the first locally transmitted cases were confirmed in the neighbouring cities of Osaka and Kyoto.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-ravaging-us-europe-but-asia-manages-to-slow-the-spread-here-s-how-101640757087687.html
29-12-2021||World||Hong Kong sends 200 police to raid pro-democracy news outlet||More than 200 Hong Kong police raided pro-democracy media outlet Stand News and arrested six people connected to it, the latest actions likely to fuel concern about press freedoms in the city.  Those arrested Wednesday for conspiring to publish seditious materials under the colonial-era Crimes Ordinance include acting Editor-in-Chief Patrick Lam and former Editor-in-Chief Chung Pui-kuen, according to the South China Morning Post newspaper. Denise Ho, a singer who testified about Hong Kong before the U.S. Congress, and ex-lawmaker Margaret Ng were among former Stand News board members arrested, the Post said, along with Chow Tat-chi and Christine Fang Meng-sang. Ho’s arrest was confirmed on her verified Facebook page. The government said in a statement that six current and former senior employees of an online media company, age 34 to 73, were arrested on sedition charges, without providing names. Police had a warrant to search and seize journalistic materials, it added in a separate notice.The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the raid and called for the release of those detained. “The arrests of six people associated with Stand News amounts to an open assault on Hong Kong’s already tattered press freedom, as China steps up direct control over the former colony,” said Steven Butler, CPJ’s Asia program coordinator. “Authorities must release the six and drop all charges against them immediately, if Hong Kong is to retain any semblance of the freedoms that its residents enjoyed only a few years ago.”The government didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. It has previously denied that local media is under political pressure, saying it is “firmly committed to protecting and respecting the freedom of the press.”The wave of arrests came a day after Jimmy Lai, founder of the now-closed Apple Daily, and six of his former staffers, were charged with conspiracy to produce and distribute seditious publications. The 74-year-old former media mogul, who also faces national security charges, has become a focus of the government’s probe into the pro-democracy opposition.Stand News emerged as one of Hong Kong’s most critical independent media outlets after its founding in 2014, with reporters and camera crews a near-constant presence documenting democracy protests in 2019. The outlet had braced for police scrutiny after the Apple Daily shuttered earlier this year, leaving Stand News as one of the last Chinese-language outlets providing coverage critical of the government. It announced in June that it would purge opinion pieces from its site and stop accepting subscriptions and sponsorships.Ronson Chan, a deputy assignment editor with Stand News who is also chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, said in an impromptu press conference outside his apartment that police searched his home Wednesday morning, taking away his computer, press pass and bank card.The journalists’ association said in a statement posted to its Facebook page that it was “deeply concerned” by the arrests and raid on a news organization. “HKJA urges the government to protect press freedom in accordance with the Basic Law,” it added, citing the city’s mini-constitution that enshrines free speech. Since Beijing passed a sweeping national security law last year, in the wake of 2019’s mass anti-government unrest, Hong Kong has imposed strict limits on what speech is allowed. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam suggested in July that a “law needs to be introduced” to police what the media publishes. The city’s public broadcaster, Radio Television Hong Kong, has had hard-hitting programs canceled and former staff have accused the organization of purging voices critical of the government.A reporter in April was convicted for making a false statement as part of investigation into a gang attack during pro-democracy protests in 2019, a rare prosecution of a journalist performing a once-routine search. Security Secretary Chris Tang in September accused the HKJA of having biased political views and favoring pro-democracy news organizations like the Daily and Stand News, something it denied.Some 46% of Hong Kong-based journalists polled by the Foreign Correspondents’ Club said they were considering leaving the city last month. Hong Kong ranked 80th in Reporters Without Borders’s latest press freedom index, down from 54th a decade ago.“Stand News has always conducted professional reporting. This is an irrefutable fact that the whole world can see,” Chan, the HKJA chairman, said Wednesday. “No crime or charge can change this fact.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-sends-200-police-to-raid-pro-democracy-news-outlet-101640753210913.html
29-12-2021||World||Why some Covid +ve workers will continue to work in this Canadian province||Quebec, the second most populous Canadian province, has "no choice" but to allow some essential workers to continue working even after testing positive for Covid-19 to prevent staff shortages from impeding its healthcare services, Health Minister Christian Dube said Tuesday.Quebec, which has been setting daily records since the Omicron variant started a new wave of rapidly rising infections, recorded 12,833 new cases on Monday - the highest one-day count of any region in Canada during the pandemic."Omicron's contagion is so exponential, that a huge number of personnel have to be withdrawn - and that poses a risk to the network capacity to treat Quebecers," Dube told reporters at a briefing."We made the decision that under a certain condition positive staff will be able to continue working according to a list of priority and risk management," he said, adding that more information would be provided in the coming days.Dube said Quebec would also offer a third dose of a Covid-19 vaccine to everyone above the age of 18 from Jan. 4.Last week, Quebec ordered bars, gyms and casinos to shut and directed people to work only from home. It also limited the size of gatherings at private homes and restaurants to six people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-some-covid-ve-workers-will-continue-to-work-in-this-canadian-province-101640745294206.html
29-12-2021||World||Australia sees hospitalizations hit record as Omicron surges||Hospitalizations due to coronavirus in Australia’s most-populous state have reached the highest level since mid-October, as a surge in omicron cases throughout most of the nation pressures the health system.New South Wales on Wednesday recorded 11,201 new covid cases in the past 24 hours, up 87% from the previous day’s figure. A total of 625 people in the state, which includes Sydney, are in hospital, including 61 in intensive care units. Testing centres in the state continue to be under heavy demand with some results taking longer than 72 hours. Most of Australia has shifted toward living with the virus, relying on vaccines and a growing arsenal of treatments. While recent studies have raised hopes that omicron symptoms may be less severe compared with the delta wave, some health experts have warned that the health system will still be under strain should too many people get infected with the new variant. Victoria, the second-most populous state, also saw new cases on Thursday jump to a record of 3,767..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-sees-hospitalizations-hit-record-as-omicron-surges-101640744550345.html
29-12-2021||World||California first state in US to top 5 million Covid-19 cases amid Omicron surge||California became the first state to record more than 5 million known coronavirus infections, according to the state dashboard Tuesday, which was delayed by the holiday weekend.The grim milestone, as reported by the California Department of Public Health, wasn’t entirely unexpected in a state with 40 million residents poised for a surge in new infections amid holiday parties and family gatherings forced indoors by a series of winter storms.The first coronavirus case in California was confirmed Jan. 25, 2020. It took 292 days to get to 1 million infections on Nov. 11 of that year, and 44 days from then to top 2 million.California’s caseload is also ahead of other large states. Texas had more than 4.4 million and Florida topped 3.9 million as of Sunday.California has recorded more than 75,500 deaths related to Covid-19.The state has fared far better than many other states that are dealing with a coronavirus surge, with areas in the Midwest and Northeast seeing the biggest jump in cases and hospitalizations amid frigid temperatures that have kept people indoors.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists California as a place with “high” transmission of the virus, along with nearly everywhere else in the country. But in the last week California averaged 16.4 new cases per 100,000 people, less than a third of the national rate.Meanwhile, coronavirus related hospitalizations have been rising slowly in California, up about 12% in the last 7 days to 4,401. That’s less than half as many as during the late summer peak and one-fifth of a year ago, before vaccines were widely available.On Tuesday, San Francisco announced it was canceling its New Year's Eve fireworks show because of the rising caseload, while Contra Costa County in the Bay Area announced that it would require masks to be worn in all public indoor places as of Wednesday. Previously, some vaccinated people had been allowed to remove them.The timeline of Covid-19 in America often comes back to California. It had some of the earliest known cases among travelers from China, where the outbreak began.The Feb. 6, 2020, death of a San Jose woman was the first known coronavirus fatality in the US. That same month, California recorded the first US case not related to travel and the first infection spread within the community.On March 19, 2020, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued the nation’s first statewide stay-at-home order, shuttering businesses and schools to try to prevent hospital overcrowding.It is unclear how many of the newly reported cases were attributed to the omicron coronavirus variant. Much about omicron remains unknown, including whether it causes more or less severe illness.Scientists say omicron spreads even easier than other coronavirus strains, including delta, and it is expected to become dominant in the US by early next year. Early studies suggest the vaccinated will need a booster shot for the best chance at preventing an omicron infection but even without the extra dose, vaccination still should offer strong protection against severe illness and death.With cases surging, the nation’s largest state-based health insurance marketplace urged more than 1.1 million uninsured Californians to sign up by Friday for subsidized coverage that would then start with the new year.Covered California said the average cost of an intensive care coronavirus hospitalization is $127,000, but estimated that 85% of those eligible for the state-brokered health insurance can get coverage free of charge, with government assistance.Those who sign up after Friday will have their coverage start on Feb. 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-first-state-in-us-to-top-5-million-covid-19-cases-amid-omicron-surge-101640740387992.html

They had a warrant to seize relevant journalistic materials under a national security law enacted last year.The arrests happened early Wednesday and searches of their residences were underway, police said.Police did not identify those who were arrested but online outlet Stand News posted a video on Facebook of police officers at the home of a deputy editor, Ronson Chan, to investigate the alleged crime. Chan is also chair of the Hong Kong Journalists Association.The arrests come as authorities crack down on dissent in the semi-autonomous Chinese city. Police charged former newspaper publisher Jimmy Lai with sedition on Tuesday. His Apple Daily newspaper shut down after its assets were frozen.They also follow the removal of sculptures and other artwork from university campuses last week. The works supported democracy and memorialized the victims of China's crackdown on democracy protesters at Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-police-arrest-6-journalists-for-sedition-101640740510117.html
29-12-2021||World||Omicron risk remains high; variant surpasses Delta in UK, US: 7 things WHO says||The World Health Organization has categorised the risks related to the Omicron variant as very high in its Covid-19 weekly epidemiological update released on Wednesday. South Africa, the country which first detected the variant on November 24, is seeing a decline in the number of Omicron cases, the WHO report said, possibly indicating that the surge is over for the time being.Here are 7 new observations made by the WHO in its weekly report:1. The overall risk related to the new variant of concern Omicron remains very high.2. Consistent evidence shows that the Omicron variant has a growth advantage over the Delta variant with a doubling time of 2-3 days3. Omicron cases are increasing rapidly and the variant has become the dominant strain in the United Kingdom and the United States.4. A decline in the incidence of cases has now been observed in South Africa.5. The rapid growth rate is likely to be a combination of both immune-evasion and intrinsic increased transmissibility of the Omicron variant6. Early data from the United Kingdom, South Africa and Denmark suggests there is a reduced risk of hospitalisation for the Omicron compared to the Delta variant.7. Preliminary data suggest that monoclonal antibodies may be less able to neutralise the Omicron variant.The overall number of Covid-19 cases increased by 11% in the week between December 20 and 26 as compared to the previous week, with the US region reporting the largest increase (39%), followed by the African region (7%). The South-East Asia region continued to report a decrease in the new cases, the WHO observed.Though Omicron is leading to fewer hospitalisation, Covid-19 hospitalisations in New Tork state are accelerating at a rate that hasn't been seen since the early days of the pandemic, reports said. On Tuesday the state said hospitalizations rose by 647 to 6,173, marking the largest daily increase since early April 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The total number of New Yorkers hospitalized with the virus remains far below last year’s peak of almost 19,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-risk-remains-high-variant-surpasses-delta-in-uk-us-7-things-who-says-101640736393900.html
