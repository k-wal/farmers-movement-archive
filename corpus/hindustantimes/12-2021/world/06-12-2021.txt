Several rounds of military and diplomatic talks have only resulted in partial disengagement of troops until now.Soldiers were killed on both sides in a brutal fight on the night of June 15 at Galwan Valley.India has repeatedly and consistently rejected China’s allegations that Indian troops crossed over to the Chinese side of the LAC in eastern Ladakh, asserting that New Delhi has always taken a responsible approach towards border management and maintaining peace and tranquility in the border areas.In September, Misri urged China to separate the ongoing border tension in eastern Ladakh from the larger boundary dispute, saying the primary concern was to restore peace and tranquillity along the LAC and not resolving the decades-long boundary disagreement.Speaking at a virtual India-China track-II dialogue last week, Misri said day-to-day affairs along the disputed border should be addressed through existing established agreements and protocols, which are not to be confused with the long-term mechanisms in place for the final resolution.“A serious violation of peace and tranquillity in the border areas naturally requires us to apply our minds on the basis of established agreements, protocols and mechanisms to resolve it,” Misri told the gathering by video link.“As we do so, any attempt to confuse border affairs with the Boundary Question is a disservice to the work of those involved in finding solutions,” he said, indicating that China was doing so by “shifting goalposts”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/challenges-have-overpowered-vast-opportunities-in-sino-india-ties-misri-tells-chinese-fm-101638812329221.html

From Lahore to Colombo” was transcribed on the coffin.Also Read | 'Murders take place when... ': Pakistan defence minister on Sialkot lynchingThe remains of Kumara were brought to Colombo from Lahore on a special SriLankan Airlines flight at state cost. The remains were received by the next-of-kin at the Bandaranaike International Airport here, officials said.From the Colombo international airport, the remains were sent to the nearby Negombo hospital for the legal proceedings, officials said.A mob of over 800 men, including supporters of hardline Islamist party Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), attacked a garment factory and lynched its general manager Priyantha Kumara and set him on fire over allegations of blasphemy on Friday last in Sialkot district, some 100 km from Lahore.Earlier, the remains were brought to the Lahore airport in an ambulance where Punjab Minister for Minority Affairs Ejaz Alam Augustine handed over the coffin to the Sri Lanka High Commission officials. The body was transported on the Sri Lankan Airlines flight.He is survived by his wife and two sons aged 14 and 9.Nilushi Kumara, the widow of the Sri Lankan export manager, has appealed to the Pakistani government for justice and compensation over her husband’s killing and urged for the safety of all Sri Lankans on Pakistani soil.Speaking to reporters this morning, she refuted the claim that her husband could have done any act to upset the religious sentiments in Pakistan.She described her husband as an innocent individual who cared for his employees and colleagues. He respected the Pakistani laws and lived as a peace-loving citizen. He also respected all religious views."My husband lived in Pakistan for 11 years, and he never once complained about the people or his colleagues there” she said.The funeral arrangements are to be notified later, family sources said.Meanwhile, Pakistan's Punjab Police claimed to have arrested seven more prime suspects allegedly involved in the lynching of 49-year-old Kumara.Also Read | Dozens held after mob kills Sri Lanka national in Pakistan"A total 131 suspects, including 26 main ones, have been arrested so far. The 26 prime suspects have played a key role in inciting the people, lynching Kumara and setting his body ablaze,” the Punjab Police tweeted on Monday.Some 15 prime suspects were presented before the Anti-Terrorism Court Gujranwala on Monday where they were remanded in police custody for 15 days.According to police, after brutally killing Kumara, the mob also wanted to kill the factory owner and set the building on fire.Kumara was working as general manager in Rajko industries, which deals in sportswear, for the last seven years.The horrific incident sparked outrage across Pakistan with all sections of the society condemning it and calling for the culprits to be punished.Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday announced Tamgha-i-Shujaat (civil award for bravery) for the victim’s colleague, Malik Adnan, who tried to rescue him from the mob.Also Read | Sialkot lynching: Pak govt to honour man who tried to shield victimThe CCTV footage showed production manager Adnan, confronting a group of angry men all by himself and making desperate attempts to avert the flare-up and then trying to shield Kumara from the mob.The mob later overpowered Adnan and dragged Kumara out on the road and tortured him with kicks, stones and iron rods, killing him on the spot. The mob had then set the body on fire over allegations of blasphemy.According to the post-mortem report, nearly all bones of Kumara were broken and his body was 99 per cent burnt in the horrific lynching incident.Kumara had gone to Pakistan in 2011 after he got a job as a mechanical engineer at an apparel factory in Faisalabad. After a year, he joined Sialkot’s Rajco Industries as its general manager and was the only Sri Lankan national working in the factory.The Sri Lankan Parliament, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa have condemned the brutal killing and has expressed hope that Pakistan Prime Minister Khan's government would bring the guilty to justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sialkot-lynching-remains-of-sri-lankan-national-brought-to-colombo-101638809581443.html
06-12-2021||World||New York City imposes vaccine mandate on private sector employers||All private employers in New York City will have to require their workers to get vaccinated against Covid-19, the mayor announced Monday, imposing one of the most aggressive vaccine rules in the nation.The move by Mayor Bill de Blasio comes as cases are climbing again in the US and the worrisome omicron variant is gaining a toehold in New York and elsewhere around the country.“We in New York City have decided to use a preemptive strike to really do something bold to stop the further growth of Covid-19 and the dangers it’s causing to all of us,” he said.De Blasio, a Democrat with just weeks left in office as leader of the nation's largest city, said the mandate will take effect Dec. 27.Speaking on MSNBC's “Morning Joe,” he said the move is aimed at staving off a spike of infections amid holiday gatherings and as cold weather drives more people indoors, where the virus is more likely to spread.Vaccine mandates across states and cities vary widely, with some states resisting any mandates and others requiring the shots for government employees or certain sectors that run a particularly high risk, such as health care workers.But most officials have not announced mandates reaching as far into the private sector, nor mandates covering so many people.President Joe Biden sought to impose a similar mandate nationally, applying to businesses with 100 or more workers, but federal courts have put that on hold ahead of a Jan. 4 deadline.De Blasio said he expects his new mandate to survive any legal challenges. A spokesperson for the mayor said it will apply to roughly 184,000 businesses in the city, which has a population of 8.8 million.Vaccinations are already required for hospital and nursing home workers and for city employees, including teachers, police officers and firefighters. A vaccination mandate for employees of private and religious schools was announced last week.Also, the mayor announced that anyone 12 or older who wants to dine indoors at a restaurant, go to a gym or see a show will have to produce proof of receiving two shots of the vaccine, up from the current requirement of one dose. In addition, proof of at least one shot will be required of children ages 5 to 11, de Blasio said.De Blasio, who leaves office at the end of the month and has indicated he may seek the nomination for governor of New York next year, has sought to portray himself as a national leader in the fight against Covid-19.The mandate takes effect days before de Blasio leaves office and Democrat Eric Adams is due to be sworn into office. Evan Thies, a spokesman for Adams, said in a statement that the mayor-elect "will evaluate this mandate and other Covid-19 strategies when he is in office and make determinations based on science, efficacy and the advice of health professionals.”Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin of Long Island, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor, called the newly announced vaccine requirement a “job-killing, small business-suppressing mandate.”“When you dangerously combine a far-left, lame duck politician, who is anti-business, one-dimensional, unaccountable, not bright and has a perpetual ‘I always know best’ attitude,' you get Bill de Blasio, the Worst Mayor in America,” Zeldin said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-imposes-vaccine-mandate-on-private-sector-employers-101638805771275.html

RAT negative cases will be allowed to proceed.However, RAT negative cases from Omicron variant countries (South Africa, Mozambique, Lesotho, Eswatini, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Namibia) will have to undergo 3 days mandatory quarantine followed by PCR test to be conducted on the third day by civil administration. RAT positive cases will be quarantined for 10 days.The NCOC placed Germany, Trinidad and Tobago, Azerbaijan, Mexico, Sri Lanka, Russia, the US, the UK, Thailand, France, Austria, Afghanistan and Turkey in category B. The travellers from these countries should be 100 per cent vaccinated.All passengers of six years and above would be required to be in possession of a negative PCR test report (max 48 hours old) before boarding, but deportees are exempted from PCR test requirement.RAT of random flights will be conducted at the airport on arrival from Category ‘B’ countries. RAT negative cases will be allowed to proceed but RAT positive cases will be quarantined for 10 days.All other countries not included in Category ‘C’ and ‘B’ were placed in Category ‘A’. The travellers should be 100 per cent vaccinated. All those six and above years should be in possession of a negative PCR test report (max 48 hours old) before boarding.

It could be more contagious, or more lethal, or both.”Gilbert is scheduled to make the remarks Monday night when she delivers this year’s Richard Dimbleby lecture, named after the late broadcaster who was the BBC’s first war correspondent and a pioneer of television news in Britain. The annual televised lecture features addresses by influential figures in business, science and government.Gilbert is set to call on governments to redouble their commitment to scientific research and pandemic preparedness, even after the threat of Covid-19 wanes.“We cannot allow a situation where we have gone through all we have gone through, and then find that the enormous economic losses we have sustained mean that there is still no funding for pandemic preparedness,’’ she said. “The advances we have made, and the knowledge we have gained, must not be lost.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientist-behind-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-bats-for-pandemic-preparedness-says-next-virus-could-be-more-lethal-101638793744359.html
06-12-2021||World||China’s Xi calls for sinicisation of religion||China is set to tighten control over religions practised in the country after President Xi Jinping stressed on the “sinicisation” of faith and uniting “believers” around the Communist Party and socialist values at a conference held in Beijing last week.“China must adhere to the direction of the sinicisation of religion, insist on uniting the masses of religious believers around the party and the government,” Xi said.Religions in China should be developed in the Chinese context and active guidance should be provided for the adaptation of religions to the socialist society, he said.Xi spoke during a two-day national conference on work related to religious affairs held in Beijing from Friday to Saturday. A similar conference was last held in 2016, giving direction to China’s policies on religion for the next five years.Similarly, last week’s high-level conference is expected to set the parameters on how China’s religious affairs will be developed in the next few years.Xi’s call for sinicisation of religions, which essentially means moulding religions according to Chinese socialist norms, comes against the backdrop of accusations that the government is oppressing Muslims and Buddhists in Xinjiang and Tibet respectively, and intermittently cracking down on Christianity, said to be the fastest developing religion in China.“Efforts should be made to keep enhancing the recognition of the motherland, the Chinese nation, the Chinese culture, the CPC and socialism with Chinese characteristics among religious personages and believers,” Xi said at the conference.“Religious activities should be carried out within the scope stipulated by laws and regulations, and should not impair the health of citizens, offend public order and good morals, interfere with educational, judicial and administrative affairs as well as social life,” he said.Xi highlighted the importance of adopting a holistic view of national security in religious work, and of “strengthening the management of online religious affairs”, which, according to the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP), is a step up from a 2018 regulation that restricted the distribution of religious information online.China officially recognises five religions: Buddhism, Catholicism, Protestantism, Taoism and Islam. The country’s Constitution guarantees religious freedom, which is protected by law but in reality the freedom to practise religion is severely restricted.In 2018, China released a “white paper” religion, directing the religious groups to support the leadership of the CPC and be subordinate to the interests of the nation and its peopleThe white paper titled China’s Policies and Practices on Protecting Freedom of Religious Belief said the country’s 200 million believers should be “actively guiding religions in adapting to the socialist society”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-xi-calls-for-sinicisation-of-religion-101638792947103.html

The development of sustainable aviation fuel is a major focus for us and forms part of our commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 through a series of short-, medium- and long-term initiatives," Doyle added.The airline's parent company, International Airlines Group (IAG), is investing USD 400 million over the next 20 years into the development of SAF and British Airways has existing partnerships with a number of technology and fuel companies to develop SAF plants and purchase the fuel. SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by over 80 per cent compared to the traditional jet fuel it replaces.Humber Refinery General Manager Darren Cunningham, the Lead Executive for Phillips 66 in the UK, said the announcement reflects the importance the aviation and energy industries are placing on sustainability and the continued development, adoption and scaling up of sustainable aviation fuel."The Humber Refinery was the first in the UK to co-process waste oils to produce renewable fuels and now we will be the first to produce SAF at scale, and we are delighted British Airways is our first UK customer," Cunningham said."We're currently refining almost half a million litres of sustainable waste feedstocks a day, and this is just a start. Markets for lower-carbon products are growing, and this agreement demonstrates our ability to supply them," Cunningham added.Last year Phillips 66 Limited invested significantly to expand its production of fuels from waste feedstocks. The investment is part of a broader energy transition plan to reduce the carbon intensity of its refinery operations and products that support 1,000 Humber Refinery jobs, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-airways-to-become-first-airline-to-use-sustainable-fuel-produced-in-uk-101638775131463.html

The photo was posted with a caption reading: "Merry Christmas! ps. Santa, please bring ammo."Merry Christmas! 🎄 ps. Santa, please bring ammo. 🎁 pic.twitter.com/NVawULhCNrThis comes just days after the US saw its deadliest school shooting of this year. Four students were killed and several others were injured, including a teacher, after a 15-year-old opened fire at a Michigan high school on November 30.The photo posted by Thomas Massie, a representative for the staunchly Republican state of Kentucky, on Twitter triggered a swift outcry, with parents of school shooting victims accusing him of being insensitive.Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter was killed in 2018 in the Parkland school shooting in Florida, also hit out at the Republican for posing with the ammunition. Tagging Massie, Fred Guttenberg wrote, “Since we are sharing family photos, here are mine. One is the last photo that I ever took of Jaime, the other is where she is buried because of the Parkland school shooting.

He also said that such messages from pro-gun Republicans "openly rub the murder of children in our faces like they scored a touchdown."Massie's post drew criticism from some Republicans as well, as Adam Kinzinger, congressman for Illinois, tweeted that he supported US gun rights, but "this isn't supporting the right to keep and bear arms, this is a gun fetish."Anthony Scaramucci, who served briefly as the communication director for former president Donald Trump, said he would fund any potential candidates running against Massie in next year's congressional elections.In midst of this, Massie also retweeted messages in support of the post, after which Twitter users called the leader "tone-deaf."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tonedeaf-disgraceful-families-of-shooting-victims-slam-us-congressman-for-christmas-photo-with-guns-101638773878380.html

UK home secretary Priti Patel has called drugs a “scourge on our society”.The 10-year plan against drug crime will take on kingpins and dismantle 2,000 more “county line” supplies, Daily Mail reported.With the implementation of the new law, the UK government will publish “crime scorecards” designed to identify weaknesses in tackling a string of offences.Drug testing will be expanded and advertising campaigns placed in university campuses warning students that drugs harm lives.With increased funding to arm the police with more tools to check the spread of drugs and catch the offenders, Prime Minister Johnson issued a warning to ‘lifestyle’ users whose cash keeps the industry afloat.One of the surprising moves will be to send middle-class drug users text message warnings from the police. The new tactics will see detectives directly contact the phones of users whose numbers are found on dealers’ mobiles, Daily Mail reported.Additional powers will also be introduced to allow authorities to seize passports and driving licenses of repeat offenders.Home secretary Priti Patel, in an article in Daily Mail, said that such repeat offenders could also be placed under home curfew.She said that almost 3,000 people died in England and Wales last year from drug misuse - more than knife crime and road accident fatalities combined.“Drugs are a major driver of crime. Abusers steal to fuel their habit and the substances are a major factor in murder and other violent offences,” said Patel, adding that as home secretary, she will not stand by while such dehumanising exploitation and criminality takes places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sms-warnings-passport-seizure-uk-govt-set-to-unveil-10-year-drugs-plan-101638770721324.html

More likely, she'll serve out this and subsequent terms at her house or a regime 'guest house'."The military, which has dominated life in Myanmar for decades, has defended its coup, claiming fraud allegations in last year's general election.International pressure on the junta to restore democracy swiftly has shown no sign of knocking the generals off course, and bloody clashes with anti-coup protesters continue across the country.On Sunday soldiers wounded at least three people after ramming a car into a peaceful demonstrators in commercial hub Yangon, eyewitnesses said.State media said one had sustained serious wounds and 11 had been arrested for protesting "without asking for permission".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-ousted-leader-aung-san-suu-kyi-jailed-for-4-years-junta-spokesperson-101638770250161.html

"And to me, he was also a friend whom I could look to for trusted guidance, or a humorous line at just the right moment to settle frayed nerves. I will miss my friend."A conservative Republican who campaigned for reining in government, Dole also had a pragmatic streak and sponsored bipartisan legislation during his tenure at the US Capitol.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered flags flown at half-staff at the building in his honor, while Biden mandated the same for the White House, federal grounds and military posts through Thursday.Calling Dole "a man of his word," Pelosi said the United States had lost "a towering leader who embodied courage and excellence in public service."Republican Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement saying he joined "the nation in mourning Bob Dole, our good friend and a bona fide American hero.""Whatever their politics, anyone who saw Bob Dole in action had to admire his character and his profound patriotism," he added.No details were initially provided, but the longtime senator had disclosed in February that he was being treated for stage four lung cancer.In a statement, his family offered thanks "for the outpouring of love over the last year."It added: "America has lost one of its heroes; our family has lost its rock. We will smile as we recall his gifted sense of humor. We will take comfort from the extraordinary moments of our lifetimes together."'Country over party' Dole, born in 1923 in Kansas, was elected to the US Senate in 1968 and was re-elected in 1974, 1980, 1986 and 1992, serving both as Senate majority and minority leader over the years.In 1976, Dole was tapped by Gerald Ford to be his vice presidential candidate, but the Republican ticket lost to Democrats Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale.Twenty years later, Dole lost the White House race to Democrat Bill Clinton."When I think of the greatest generation, I think of Senator Bob Dole -- a man who dedicated his life to serving our country. Rest In Peace, my friend," tweeted Senator Mitt Romney, also a former Republican presidential candidate.Former president Donald Trump said in a statement that Dole was "an American war hero and true patriot for our Nation. He served the Great State of Kansas with honor and the Republican Party was made stronger by his service."Trump's predecessor Barack Obama said on Twitter that Dole was "a war hero, a political leader, and a statesman" whose generation placed "country over party."On Twitter, former House speaker Newt Gingrich called Dole "a unique American figure whose courage, dedication, endurance and patriotism made him worthy of study and emulation."‘Courage on the battlefield’Dole has long been praised for his military service. He enlisted as an officer in the US Army and in April 1945 was grievously wounded in the back and right arm by machine gun fire during fighting against German troops in Italy.He was hospitalized for more than three years, and the wounds left him with a shriveled right arm that ended his childhood hopes of being an athlete or a doctor.Dole "made life better for generations of Americans -- past and present," Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement.Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders also sent condolences, saying, "Bob Dole served his country with courage on the battlefield, and with dignity in the Senate."Social media tributes recalled how he insisted on standing, held up by an aide, to salute the casket of former president George H.W. Bush -- who also served in World War II -- at his funeral in 2018.Dole is survived by his daughter Robin, and his second wife, Elizabeth Dole, who herself had a distinguished political career, serving as US secretary of transportation, secretary of labor and senator from North Carolina.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tributes-pour-in-for-late-veteran-us-lawmaker-bob-dole-will-miss-my-friend-says-president-biden-101638766325783.html

The reporter had asked whether the Pakistan government -led by Imran Khan's Tehreek-e-Insaf, is considering an "effective crackdown" against groups like TLP.A factory manager, Priyantha Kumara Diyawadana was lynched by a mob in Sialkot on Friday. He was accused of blasphemy. Later the mob burned his body. Several gruesome video clips shared on social media showed a mob beating the victim while chanting slogans against blasphemy.The incident sparked a countrywide rage and condemnation with Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan calling it "a day of shame" for the country. The killing has been linked with the members of TLP, however, the group has distanced itself from the incident."You know the reasons [behind this incident] too. When children ... grow up, they become spirited and do things out of emotions," Khattar told the journalist. "This does not mean 'this was the result of that action'," he also said, adding, "in Sialkot too some young men had gathered and accused Kumara of disrespecting Islam, which led to the "sudden" lynching, as per the Dawn report.Khattak continued and said, even he could do something wrong in a state of heightened emotions, and such incidents did not mean "Pakistan is going towards destruction."Khattak also said boys entering adulthood are "ready to do anything" and learn with age how to control their emotions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/murders-take-place-when-young-people-get-emotional-pakistan-defence-minister-101638764915254.html

The United Nations World Food Program said in a report that Afghanistan’s economy has been in freefall since the Taliban took control of the country after ousting the Western-backed government.The economic crisis and limited availability of cash have created a new class of hungry as, for the first time, urban residents are facing food insecurity at similar rates to rural communities, according to the UN agency. WFP chief David Beasley, who recently visited Afghanistan, said his team is in a “race against time” to avert a humanitarian catastrophe in the country.“What’s happening in Afghanistan is just horrific,” said Beasley. “I met families with no jobs, no cash and no food, mothers who sold one child to feed another, and the lucky children who made it to the hospital. The world cannot turn its back as the Afghan people starve.”West hits out at Taliban over ‘summary killings’, enforced disappearances in AfghanistanAs harsh winter sets in, humanitarian organizations have warned that a million children could lose their lives. The New York Times reported that the food insecurity and impending mass starvation could be potentially damning for the new Taliban government as well the United States which has imposed economic restrictions while it measures the actions of the Sunni Pashtun group.Mary-Ellen McGroarty, WFP’s country director for Afghanistan, implored the international community to respond to the “tsunami of hunger”.“We need to separate the humanitarian imperative from the political discussions,” she said. “The innocent people of Afghanistan, the children…who have their lives upended through no fault of their own, cannot be condemned to hunger and starvation just because of the lottery of geopolitics and the lottery of birth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/talibanruled-afghanistan-on-brink-of-horrific-mass-starvation-as-harsh-winter-sets-in-101638758619616.html

Some 450 researchers around the world have begun urgent studies to understand the extent to which omicron’s mutations may affect vaccine effectiveness and increase its transmissibility in a global effort that may yield answers in a few days, a World Health Organization scientist said last week.“Detection of Omicron variant transmission between two fully vaccinated persons across the corridor of a quarantine hotel has highlighted this potential concern,” Haogao Gu, Leo Poon and colleagues wrote in the study.Covid-19 cases have risen exponentially in parts of South Africa over the past month, heralding an omicron-fueled fourth wave of the pandemic disease. Dozens of countries have detected omicron infections. In Singapore, cases have “mostly displayed mild symptoms, and no omicron-related deaths have been reported so far,” the Ministry of Health said Sunday. Still, it’s too early to draw conclusions about the strain’s severity and omicron remains an “unknown threat,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicrons-spread-across-hotel-hall-highlights-transmission-worry-101638752425449.html

But Fauci has cautioned against drawing conclusions about the severity of illness caused by Omicron based on early data.“Thus far, it does not look like there’s a great degree of severity to it,” President Joe Biden's chief medial adviser said at CNN's State of the Union.“But we have really got to be careful before we make any determinations that it is less severe or it really doesn’t cause any severe illness, comparable to Delta,” he added.Even as the Omicron variant has spread to at least 17 US states, Fauci said the Biden administration is reevaluating the travel restrictions on south African countries as more information becomes available.India's Omicron tally rises to 21: Tracking the spread of new coronavirus strainUN secretary-general Antonio Guterres blasted such measures as “travel apartheid" and experts have raised concern that it could affect transparency in future. Critics of the travel ban argue that the Omicron variant was first identified in South Africa and doesn’t necessarily mean that it originated there.“Hopefully we’ll be able to lift that ban in a quite reasonable period of time,” Fauci said. “We all feel very badly about the hardship that has been put on not only on South Africa but the other African countries.”World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiologist Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, however, told CBS' Face The Nation that even if a large number of Omicron cases are mild, some of those will need hospitalisations.“They will need to go into ICU and some people will die. ... We don’t want to see that happen on top of an already difficult situation with delta circulating globally,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-puzzle-fauci-says-possibly-mild-cases-who-expert-warns-about-hospitalisations-101638755125314.html
