Officials said 146 people infected with the coronavirus died between Wednesday and Thursday.UK officials have said the omicron variant of the coronavirus is spreading at an “absolutely phenomenal pace,” with case numbers doubling every two to three days.The UK Health Security Agency said another 1,691 omicron cases have been identified in the country, bringing the total to 11,708, though scientists warn the number is likely to be much higher.England’s chief medical officer says it’s possible that daily hospital admissions from Covid-19 this winter will surpass the previous peak numbers, though he cautioned that “huge uncertainties” remain about the omicron variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-reports-fresh-daily-record-of-covid-19-cases-after-88-376-infections-101639673279125.html
16-12-2021||World||India, Taiwan start talks on free trade agreement||India and Taiwan have begun talks on a free trade pact and creating a semiconductor manufacturing hub in the country as part of efforts to meet the burgeoning demand for the chips needed for products ranging from cellphones to cars.The two sides set up four groups earlier this year that are focusing on creating a semiconductor manufacturing hub, education and training of highly specialised manpower needed for the industry, a bilateral investment agreement and a free trade agreement, two people familiar with the matter said.The contacts on these issues gathered momentum around the middle of this year and the group on semiconductors met twice virtually, in August and September, while there was one round of talks on the proposed trade pact, the people cited above said.Both sides are eyeing the possibility of one of Taiwan’s semiconductor giants, a list that includes Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), setting up a facility in India. The Indian side has proposed several sites for the facility though the two sides are yet to come to a final decision, the people said.“It is a very complicated process because a company like TSMC uses components from hundreds of other firms. Setting up a hub in India means convincing those firms to also set up a facility in India to ensure the supply of components,” one of the people cited above said.If the proposal is finalised, it will be only the second such manufacturing hub set up in a foreign country by a Taiwanese manufacturer. TSMC, which has a market value of more than $550 billion and accounts for about 54% of global revenues from semiconductors, has set up a $12-billion fabrication plant in the US that is expected to start production in 2024. TSMC is also eyeing possible facilities in Japan and Europe.For Taiwan, such investments are linked to strategic gains at a time when China has increased its pressure on the island, stepping up incursions into its air defence zone and taking tensions in the Taiwan Strait to a new high amid threatening talk of an invasion. The Taiwanese decision to create the semiconductor manufacturing hub in the US was seen as closely linked to military support extended by Washington to Taipei.Taiwan is also hoping such moves will translate into greater support for its efforts in other areas, such as a presence at the World Health Organization (WHO). As part of overall efforts to increase trade and investment, Taiwan is also eyeing the possibility of opening a representative office in Mumbai because of the potential for investments and manufacturing in Maharashtra and Gujarat.India and Taiwan established representative offices in each other’s capitals in 1995. A second Taipei Economic and Cultural Center was established in Chennai in 2012.As with most contacts with Taiwan, the Indian side has been proceeding cautiously, largely because of the tensions with China over the military standoff in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).However, India’s rapidly growing need for semiconductors - expected to be around $100 billion by 2025, up from the current level of $2 billion - is the main reason for the government’s push in the field. On Wednesday, the Union cabinet approved a production-linked incentive scheme with an outlay of ₹76,000 crore ($10 billion) for development of a semiconductor and display manufacturing ecosystem.The government has also committed support of ₹2,30,000 crore ($30 billion) to position India as a global hub for electronics manufacturing, with semiconductors as the foundational block.Sana Hashmi, Taiwan fellow at the Institute of International Relations at the National Chengchi University in Taipei, said advancing economic ties falls in the framework of the unofficial relations between India and Taiwan.“One of the primary objectives of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in Delhi and the India-Taipei Association (ITA) in Taipei is to work towards strengthening commercial ties,” she said.Hashmi said though China objects to all contacts with Taiwan, there has been an understanding that cooperation on economic and cultural issues and science and technology doesn’t violate adherence to the “One China” policy by other nations.“Seemingly, it was fine for other countries as long as China was reaping the benefits of Taiwanese investments. Now with the growing cross-Strait tensions, Taiwan’s focus has been on pulling out investments from China and reducing its dependence. Cooperation in the semiconductor industry is one of India’s main interests vis-a-vis Taiwan,” she said.“Several agreements are already in place between India and Taiwan. So, another agreement in the economic field doesn’t violate the ‘One China’ policy,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-taiwan-start-talks-on-free-trade-agreement-101639673988033.html
16-12-2021||World||EU medicines agency recommends Xevudy, Kineret for Covid treatment||The European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Thursday recommended the use of Kineret and Xevudy for the treatment of coronavirus disease (Covid-19).EMA’s human medicines committee recommended the use of Kineret in adult Covid-19 patients with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen and who are at risk of developing severe respiratory failure.Kineret, an immunosuppressive medicine, reduces the activity of the immune system and is currently used by the EU member countries for the treatment of various inflammatory conditions.“In Covid-19 patients, the medicine is considered to reduce the inflammation associated with Covid-19 and thus decrease lower airway damage, preventing development of severe respiratory failure,” the medicines agency said in a statement.The committee recommended authorising Kineret after evaluating data from a study that involved 606 hospitalised adults with moderate or severe Covid. In addition to 'standard of care', these patients were administered Kineret or placebo by injection under the skin. Standard of care includes the use of low or high flow oxygen and the corticosteroid medicine dexamethasone, with some also receiving remdesivir.EMA said the study showed greater clinical symptom improvements in patients treated with Kineret plus standard of care compared with those who received placebo plus standard of care.The committee also recommended the approval of Xevudy for treating the disease in adults and adolescents who do not require supplemental oxygen but are at increased risk of the disease becoming severe. Xevudy is the third monoclonal antibody to be recommended for Covid treatment in the EU.The committee evaluated data from a study involving 1,057 Covid-19 patients with at least one underlying condition, putting them at increased risk of severe Covid. The study showed that Xevudy significantly reduced hospitalisation and deaths, with 1% of patients being hospitalised for longer than 24 hours within 29 days of treatment with the monoclonal antibody, compared with 6% of patients on placebo.EMA said the majority of patients involved in the study were infected with the original SARS-CoV-2 virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-medicines-agency-recommends-xevudy-kineret-for-covid-treatment-101639663588465.html
16-12-2021||World||China dismisses concerns over safety of Lithuanian diplomats||The Chinese foreign ministry on Thursday dismissed concerns over the safety of Lithuanian diplomats stationed in Beijing, a day after the Baltic country’s diplomatic corps and dependents left China over “uncertainty” of their situation.The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said claims that Lithuanian diplomats faced safety issues were “purely fictitious”.Wang also denied that the Chinese government had forbidden the Chinese staff at the Lithuanian representative office from working.Lithuanian authorities said on Wednesday they had summoned their top diplomat back from China for “consultations” and that the embassy would operate remotely for the time being.A statement on the website of the Lithuanian foreign ministry, the country’s charge d’affaires ad interim in China, Audra Ciapiene, returns to Vilnius for consultations.”In all, 19 people, including diplomats and dependents, left Beijing on Wednesday.A diplomatic source told Reuters that they left due to “safety considerations” in response to “intimidation”.Foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis confirmed the diplomats’ departure in a press briefing in Vilnius.He responded to a question about the reports of Lithuanian diplomats facing pressure in China, saying, “Uncertainty creates various possible interpretations.”“The Lithuanian side also never raised the issue of personal safety to China,” Wang said at the regular ministry briefing on Thursday.“If the Lithuanian side does not face reality, if it does not reflect and correct mistakes but instead shirks its own responsibility, then it will only challenge bilateral relations even more,” Wang added.The ultimate damage will be to Lithuania itself, Wang said.In November, China downgraded its diplomatic ties with Lithuania, expressing strong dissatisfaction after Taiwan, which Beijing claims as a breakaway region, opened a de facto embassy in capital Vilnius.China views Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, as its territory and opposes Taiwan having diplomatic ties with a third country.Earlier in November, Lithuania brushed aside China’s protests, to allow Taipei to set up a Taiwanese representative office in Lithuania in Vilnius, a first in the European Union.In the Lithuanian ministry’s statement, Vilnius said the representative office in Beijing would operate remotely for the time being and consular services for Lithuanian citizens in China would continue but in a limited capacity.“Lithuania is ready to continue the dialogue with China and restore the functions of the embassy to their full extent once a mutually beneficial agreement has been reached,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-dismisses-concerns-over-safety-of-lithuanian-diplomats-101639655386359.html

16-12-2021||World||Taiwan President Tsai calls for greater unity against rising authoritarianism||Addressing a group of visiting French lawmakers, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen called Wednesday for greater unity among democratic nations in the face of rising authoritarianism.Tsai also said the self-governing island republic would take on greater responsibilities to contribute to regional and global peace and stability.“Democratic allies should strengthen cooperation when facing challenges such as swift changes in international affairs and expansion of authoritarianism," Tsai said during the meeting at the Presidential Office Building.“Taiwan will take on its responsibilities in the international society and expects to contribute more to the Indo-Pacific region’s peace and stability, as well as the world’s prosperity and development, along with France and other like-minded partners in the European Union,” she said.The visit by the six members of the French National Assembly offers a valuable opportunity for Tsai to address an international political audience in the face of China’s efforts to isolate the island it claims as its own territory with no right to diplomatic recognition.Chinese pressure has reduced the number of Taiwan’s diplomatic allies to just 14.Francois de Rugy, who heads the France-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group, said the French government had been positive about moves to strengthen ties between the sides.He presented Tsai with a copy of a resolution overwhelmingly adopted last month by the Assembly supporting Taiwan's participation in international bodies such as the International Civil Aviation Organization, Interpol, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the World Health Assembly.The National Assembly aims to “encourage a constructive regional dialogue in order to ensure peace and dialogue over the Taiwan Strait,” de Rugy told Tsai.The French delegation is the second to visit Taiwan in recent months, following one led by Sen. Alain Richard in October, during which they met with Tsai, Taiwanese economic and health officials and the Mainland Affairs Council overseeing exchanges with China that have been all but suspended by Beijing.China sought to have that visit called off, despite it being part of regular parliamentary exchanges that had been ongoing for years.Despite Chinese pressure, Taiwan has been stepping up exchanges with countries that don’t officially recognize it as a country, often bringing a furious response from Beijing.Beijing punished Lithuania, which like France is a member of the European Union, after it agreed to allow Taiwan to set up a representative office in the capital Vilnius under the name “Taiwan” rather than “Chinese Taipei,” as Beijing prefers.Beijing slapped a trade embargo on the Baltic state and has threatened multinationals that do business with it. It also withdrew its ambassador to Vilnius and expelled the Lithuanian ambassador to Beijing.On Wednesday, Lithuania’s Foreign Ministry said it had closed its embassy in Beijing and pulled its last diplomat out of the Chinese capital. Lithuania was “ready to continue the dialogue with China and restore the functions of the embassy to their full extent once a mutually beneficial agreement is reached,” the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-president-tsai-calls-for-greater-unity-against-rising-authoritarianism-101639634178617.html

16-12-2021||World||Kim Jong Un's policy of a complete but isolated 10-yr-rule in North Korea||Since assuming power 10 years ago, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ruled the isolated country with absolute power, significantly expanded its nuclear arsenal and become the North’s first ruler to hold a summit with a sitting US president.But now, he’s hunkering down and struggling to revive a dilapidated economy battered hard by pandemic-related border shutdowns, toughened UN sanctions and mismanagement.When he inherited power upon the death of his father and longtime ruler Kim Jong Il, there were questions about the future of North Korea. Little was known about the then-27-year-old son who was taking his family’s dynastic rule into a third generation. But Kim Jong Un quickly consolidated his power by orchestrating a spate of brutal purges and executions that removed his potential rivals including his own powerful uncle.With a firm grip on power, Kim has carried on his family’s nuclear ambitions and diverted much of his country’s scarce resources toward programs to build nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the US mainland. His provocative run of nuclear and missile tests in 2016-17 placed North Korea a step closer to its goal of possessing such functioning intercontinental ballistic missiles, but they also led North Korea to face stricter UN sanctions and deepened international isolation.Entering 2018, Kim abruptly took conciliatory gestures by sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics held in rival South Korea and telling visiting South Korean envoys that he was willing to place his nuclear program on the negotiating table. Some critics accused Kim of just trying to weaken the sanctions, buy time and perfect his weapons program, but then- US President Donald Trump accepted Kim’s offers for unprecedented summit talks between the leaders of the two countries.In 2018-19, Kim met Trump three times and held summits with other world leaders including South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. These meetings gave Kim the diplomatic legitimacy that his government had long desired.The high-stakes nuclear diplomacy triggered a rare mood of rapprochement on the Korean Peninsula, such as athletes from the rival Koreas marching together during the Olympics’ opening ceremony and their singers performing in each other’s territory. North Korea also demolished its nuclear test site and released American detainees, while the US and South Korean militaries suspended or canceled some of their regular drills.But such moves were short-lived, as the Kim-Trump diplomacy eventually collapsed in 2019 due to wrangling over the sanctions.Since early last year, Kim has largely shut his country’s borders as part of draconian anti-virus measures that experts say are taking a heavy toll on his country’s already troubled economy. He called ongoing difficulties “the worst-ever” and compared them with a 1990s famine that killed hundreds of thousands.But there are no signs that Kim will return to talks with the United States anytime soon. Instead, he has repeatedly warned he will bolster his nuclear and missile arsenals unless Washington drops its hostility against Pyongyang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-policy-of-a-complete-but-isolated-10-yr-rule-in-north-korea-101639631299262.html
16-12-2021||World||'Show, don't tell': Image politics key strategy for Kim Jong Un||From the youthful party functionary to the leader riding a horse through mountain snows, North Korea has sought to portray Kim Jong Un as increasingly both authoritative and popular over his decade in power.North Korea is one of the most isolated and censored societies on the planet, with its state media tightly controlling what the people see and hear.Three generations of the Kim family have ruled the country with absolute authority since 1948, and analysts say the regime has used carefully crafted images to ensure their power.To outsiders, Kim is regarded as a ruthless tyrant with an undying obsession to develop the country's nuclear weapons, even at the cost of starving the population.But North Korea's tightly-controlled state media offers a softer side: Kim caressing weeping orphans, being mobbed by gushing female soldiers, or smiling broadly on a mound of potatoes."The images that the regime chooses to disseminate and weave into Kim's hagiography say a lot about how Kim envisions North Korea's future and his place in it," wrote Jung Pak, now US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, in a 2018 report before she took up her current post.In his frequent public appearances, Kim is seen giving guidance at various economic, military, and social venues, just as his father and grandfather did.In marked contrast, he is also shown pulling weeds, riding roller coasters, operating a tank, or galloping on a horse."Kim appears to want to reinforce the impression that he is young, vigorous, on the move -- qualities that he attributes to his country as well," Pak said in the Brookings Institution report.Carefully crafted photographs and films are "a universal part of politics" to win public support, said Michael Madden, fellow at the Stimson Center, but Pyongyang's propaganda had different motives."In North Korea, it is not a matter of being responsive to public opinion, but influencing how... citizens view or regard the leadership."White horseImage was "particularly important" to Kim when he was rushed into power after the death of his father Kim Jong Il on December 17, 2011, said Jean Lee, senior fellow at the Wilson Center."He inherited leadership at a time when he was young and a virtual unknown to his own people."Madden added the regime launched an "emulation campaign" early on, with the young leader adopting the clothing and haircut of his grandfather, North Korea's founder Kim Il Sung.The striking resemblance between the two even fuelled international speculation that the younger Kim intentionally put on weight to increase the likeness."The strategy was to cast him as a modern reincarnation of his much-beloved grandfather -- in looks, personality and policy -- to justify his right to rule," Lee told AFP.Kim's weight -- which rose significantly during his time in power before dropping sharply this year -- has regularly prompted questions about his health.But analysts say that images carried by North Korea's official KCNA news agency or the Rodong Sinmun newspaper have a wider purpose beyond aesthetics.In October 2019, North Korean media published pictures of Kim riding a white horse through a winter landscape to the summit of the sacred Mount Paektu.The motif has been a recurrent theme in images of Kim's predecessors but some North Korea watchers saw them as a signal for a new policy direction.They came during stalled US-North Korea talks after a failed second summit between Kim and then US president Donald Trump, and Madden described them as "anti-imperialist imagery".The photos carried the message that "North Korea will not be pushed around or intimidated by 'big power countries'", he added.'Time of hardship'Impoverished North Korea is under multiple sets of international sanctions over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, and has long suffered chronic food shortages.The country is facing its worst economic crisis for years, hit by both sanctions and its self-imposed coronavirus blockade.In recent months, pictures of the leader have shown his acute weight loss, "playing into Kim's image of being more accountable to the people" according to Jenny Town, senior fellow at the Stimson Center.The official Korean Central Television aired a rare interview of an unnamed citizen saying the people were "heartbroken" over the change in his physique and that "everyone just started to cry" at the sight of Kim.The images were aimed at "showing that sacrifices are being made a time of hardship for the country", Town said -- but added that its effectiveness was unknown."The longer the hardships continue, the less compelling images of the leader will do."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/show-don-t-tell-image-politics-key-strategy-for-kim-jong-un-101639626221934.html

16-12-2021||World||Typhoon Rai nears Philippines, thousands evacuated; torrential rain warning issued | 10 points||A strong typhoon is heading towards the Philippines and is expected to make landfall on Thursday afternoon. Typhoon Rai has the ferocity to become a super typhoon, according to weather experts.It has already been upgraded to a category 4 storm, the second-highest classification. The typhoon has wind speeds of 165 km per hour, with gusts of up to 205 km per hour, the Philippines' weather bureau said.The storm is on track to slam the southern and central portions of the Philippines.Here are the key things to know about the typhoon and the ongoing rescue efforts:• This will be the 15th typhoon to hit the country this year. It is also one of the strongest storms so far.• The authorities have warned of storm surges, flooding and landslides in coastal and mountainous areas in the typhoon's path.• The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) – which monitors typhoons locally – has warned of “heavy to intense and at times torrential” rain in most parts of the Philippines from Thursday to Friday.• Nearly 30,000 residents in Eastern Samar province, one of the hardest hit by super typhoon Haiyan in 2013, have been evacuated from their homes in the past two days.• "We are getting pounded already by strong wind and rain," Governor Ben Evardone of the Eastern Samar province told DZMM radio station.• The southern province of Surigao del Sur has already started to feel the force of the storm.• Several airlines have cancelled dozens of flights, while transport authorities banned sea and land travel in the central and southern Philippines, leaving thousands stranded at ports.• The Philippines has postponed the start of a mass vaccination drive in most parts of the country because of the storm.• The Southeast Asian nation, an archipelago of more than 7,600 islands, sees around 20 tropical storms annually, causing floods and landslides.• What makes the condition favourable for typhoons like Rai to form are very warm ocean waters and low wind shear.

16-12-2021||World||Covid-19: Amid Omicron threat, Canadians urged not to travel abroad||The Canadian government on Wednesday urged citizens to avoid foreign travel over the Christmas holidays, saying the Covid-19 Omicron variant "makes us fear the worst," including soaring infections and travel disruptions.The travel advisory will be re-evaluated in four weeks, but public health restrictions could be imposed in the interim if the pandemic situation worsens, officials told a news conference."Our government is officially advising Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside Canada," health minister Jean-Yves Duclos told a news conference."Those who are planning to travel, I say very clearly: Now is not the time to travel. The rapid spread of the Covid variant on the global scale makes us fear the worst," he said."Traveling Canadians could contract the virus or get stranded abroad."At an emergency meeting late Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had proposed closing the border, but the measure was roundly rejected by provincial leaders, a source told AFP.Duclos said Covid-19 testing of travelers at Canadian airports would be increased and other public health measures would be rolled out in the coming days."There will certainly be other public health measures (coming), because the situation will continue to evolve," Duclos said."The epidemiological situation is changing rapidly.

16-12-2021||World||'Almost beyond belief': Biden on tornado-ravaged Kentucky||US President Joe Biden pledged increased federal assistance to Kentucky on Wednesday as he surveyed the damage in tornado-ravaged towns and consoled survivors of the twisters that took scores of lives."The scope and scale of this destruction is almost beyond belief," the 79-year-old president said after visiting the towns of Mayfield and Dawson Springs."These tornadoes devoured almost everything in their path," he said in Dawson Springs in western Kentucky. "Your homes, your businesses, your houses of worship, your dreams, your lives."Biden said the federal government would foot 100 percent of the bill for emergency relief for the next 30 days and will continue to do "whatever it takes, for as long as it takes."Biden, who has made empathy one of his trademarks, strolled down a ruined street in Mayfield, stopping to chat and shake the hand of a woman who was seated in the rubble of a collapsed building.Wearing a baseball cap and a dark blue suit with no tie, the president paused in the street at one point and bowed his head in prayer with the town's mayor and several other people.Before touring Mayfield, a town of some 10,000 people, and Dawson Springs, population 2,500, Biden received a briefing on the damage from last week's tornadoes, which killed at least 74 people in Kentucky and 14 in surrounding states."There's no red tornadoes, there's no blue tornadoes," the Democratic president said in a reference to the colors of the nation's two largest political parties -- the red of Republicans and the blue of Democrats.Andy Beshear, the Kentucky governor, is a Democrat, but Kentuckians voted overwhelmingly for Republican candidate Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election.In addition to federal aid, more than 500 National Guard troops have been deployed to help with law enforcement, traffic control and recovery, along with volunteers and associations on the ground to support victims.- 'It does mean a lot' - "We appreciate the president coming down, coming to Mayfield," Bryan Wilson, a lawyer, told AFP, as he sifted through the rubble of his firm's flattened downtown building. "It does mean a lot."Wilson, speaking over the sounds of construction equipment removing debris, said he was trying to salvage legal files, client records, computers -- anything that would preserve the integrity of the business.He said Biden's visit signals that people in Washington "do care about rural America.""And hopefully that gives the incentive for people to stay, to build back," he said.Wilson said he hopes Biden's trip heals some of the bitter political and cultural rifts in the country."America has been divided for too long," he said. "This is not Republican, this is not Democrat, this is not independent. This is America."Brad Mills, a 63-year-old orthodontist in Mayfield, said his message to Biden was to expedite federal disaster assistance."Let's get the federal aid in here that we need," Mills said. "As divided as we are on so many issues, we've got common ground here."Mills spoke to AFP outside his office in downtown Mayfield that had been his father's and his grandfather's before him. His son Stuart, who is in dental school, was on the roof putting on a tarp.Asked if he was going to rebuild his practice, Mills said, "that's going to be the big question."It's so emotional right now, you can't make a rational decision."As Biden toured Kentucky, weather forecasters warned that parts of the midwestern United States were facing a potentially "historical weather day," with wind gusts up to 100 miles per hour (160 kilometers per hour) and the possibility of tornadoes.mlm-aue/cl/swTwitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/almost-beyond-belief-biden-on-tornado-ravaged-kentucky-101639608765192.html
