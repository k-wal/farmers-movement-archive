An analysis by the New York Times has revealed that over 55,000 Covid-19 patients in the country are currently hospitalised. This figure is though a lot fewer than what it was in September, it saw a surge more than 15 per cent in the past two weeks.At the moment, the analysis showed, the US is witnessing about 121,300 Covid-19 cases per day - a rise of about 27 per cent from two weeks before. The rate of logged fatalities are up by 12 per cent, therefore averaging about 1,275 per day.The NYT report said that Michigan tops the chart in the country with most hospitalisations per capita. Cases and hospitalisations are also seeing a rapid increase in Connecticut that reported a 69 per cent rise in patients over the last two weeks.What remains concerning is that states with one of the highest vaccination rates are also struggling with hospitalisations. For instance, Maine has fully vaccinated about 73 per cent of its population, behind only Vermont and Rhode Island, as per New York Times database. However, coronavirus cases in Maine recently went up to its peak since the pandemic struck the US.One of Maine's largest hospital - Maine Medical Center, said in a statement on Wednesday that there had been times this week when they lacked even a single critical bed, thus forcing surgeries to be postponed. It also said that the hospital is looking after an overwhelming number of patients.Also Read | Omicron versus Delta: Fauci breaks down what is known and what's unknownMaine Medical Center, the state’s largest hospital, said in a statement on Wednesday that there had been times this week “when there were no critical care beds available,” forcing hospital leaders to postpone surgeries.Missouri's University Health hospital system's chief medical officer Dr Mark Steele told New York Times that at the moment, the Delta variant is overwhelmingly prominent and now there are Omicron-related concerns to think about as well.Delta variant of Covid-19, discovered in India in late 2020, caused hysteria across the world with several countries opting for fresh and stricter lockdowns to combat it.Meanwhile, as Omicron - classified as a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organisation (WHO) similar to that of Delta, cases have already been reported in at least 30 nations, fear remains regarding its impact. The UN health agency, has however, said that there is no reason to assume that Omicron is going to be more severe than other variants of coronavirus, or that available vaccines will fail to render protection against it.WHO emergencies' director Michael Ryan told AFP that currently there is no indication to suggest that Omicron will be more dangerous than Delta, and existing vaccines should protect people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-omicron-us-still-battling-delta-variant-driven-hospitalisations-report-101639056419819.html

Around 4.7 million 16- and 17-year-olds in the United States are fully vaccinated and more than 2.5 million of them are six months past their second dose.Some scientists have raised concerns about additional shots for the age group because of the elevated risk of rare cases of heart inflammation in young men that have been linked to messenger RNA vaccines such as the Pfizer/BioNTech shot.All US adults are currently eligible for booster shots of the three authorized Covid-19 vaccines.The FDA's authorization comes a day after Pfizer and BioNTech released data suggesting that booster shots could be key to protection against infection from the newly identified Omicron variant of the coronavirus.The CDC has identified fewer than 100 cases of Omicron in the United States, but they are expected to increase in the coming weeks and months.Meanwhile, the dominant Delta variant, which is very transmissible and can be passed on by people who are fully vaccinated, has driven up infections. Regions where activities have moved indoors for winter, such as the Northeast, have seen some of the biggest increases in new cases, which now average close to 120,000 each day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-authorizes-pfizer-biontech-booster-for-16-and-17yearolds-101639069641921.html
09-12-2021||World||Democratic principles should guide global governance: PM Modi at Summit for Democracy||The principles of democracy should guide global governance and technology companies should contribute to preserving open and democratic societies, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday at the Summit for Democracy hosted by US President Joe Biden. Modi made the remarks at a virtual leaders’ plenary session that was hosted by Biden and held behind closed doors, according to people familiar with the matter. The prime minister is participating in the two-day event at Biden’s invitation and the plenary session witnessed interventions from leaders of only 12 countries. Democratic spirit, including respect for rule of law and pluralistic ethos, is ingrained in Indians, and the Indian diaspora carries it too, contributing to the economic well-being and social harmony of their adopted homes, Modi told the session, according to the people cited above. “The prime minister stressed that principles of democracy should guide global governance, and given technology’s ability to impact democracy positively or negatively, technology companies should contribute to preserving open and democratic societies,” one of the people cited above said. Modi emphasised the need for democratic countries to deliver on values enshrined in their constitutions, and outlined sensitivity, accountability, participation and reform orientation as the four pillars of Indian democratic governance. He also recalled India’s Constituent Assembly had held its first session on this same day 75 years ago. He highlighted India’s civilisational ethos as one of the original sources of democracy. Biden is hosting the virtual summit for leaders from government, civil society and the private sector to focus on challenges and opportunities facing democracies worldwide. The summit will provide a platform to the leaders to announce individual and collective commitments, reforms and initiatives to defend democracy and human rights at home and abroad, according to the US state department. “As the world’s largest democracy, India has commended this innovative initiative. India has always stood ready to share its experiences with fellow democracies,” another person said on condition of anonymity. A second closed-door leaders’ plenary session was hosted on Thursday by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Official interventions by leaders of numerous countries were also live streamed on the website of the Summit for Democracy. Modi will deliver India’s national statement on Friday. In his opening remarks at the summit, Biden highlighted the challenges being faced by democracy worldwide. “Democracy doesn’t happen by accident, we have to renew it with each generation. And this is an urgent matter on all our parts, in my view,” he said. “Because the data we are seeing is largely pointing in the wrong direction. Freedom House reports that 2020 marked the 15th consecutive year of global freedom in retreat. Another recent report from the International Institute of Democracy and Electoral Assistance noted more than half of all democracies have experienced a decline in at least one aspect of their democracy over the last 10 years, including the US,” he said. These trends are being exacerbated by global challenges that can be addressed by shared efforts, Biden said. Biden announced the establishment of the Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal, for which the US will provide $424.4 million in 2020. Under this initiative, the US with likeminded partners to defend and sustain democratic resilience. These efforts will focus on the five areas – supporting free and independent media, fighting corruption, bolstering democratic reformers, advancing technology for democracy, and defending free and fair elections and political processes.

The global health body said the administration of booster doses might affect the supply to low-income countries.Initially several countries introduced a booster inoculation programme for older populations and those with underlying health issues. However, the emergence of the new variant has prompted some countries to expand the programme to all eligible beneficiaries.“As we head into whatever the omicron situation is going to be, there is a risk that the global supply is again going to revert to high-income countries hoarding vaccines to protect — in a sense, in excess — their opportunity for vaccination, and a sort of ‘no-regrets’ kind of approach,” the Associated Press quoted WHO’s director of the department of immunisation, vaccines and biologicals Kate O’Brien as saying.Also read | EU agency says Omicron cases so far appear 'mostly mild'. Then cautions“What is going to shut down disease is for everybody who is especially at risk of disease to become vaccinated. We seem to be taking our eye off that ball in countries,” she further said.Mike Ryan, WHO’s emergencies director, briefed on the Omicron variant and said, “We don't fully understand the implications clinically or the implications for our vaccines... What we do in the coming days and weeks, both in terms of virus suppression, vaccination and equity will make a huge difference to the evolution of this pandemic in 2022.”The warning from WHO came even as the doses supplied to the global vaccine sharing programme COVAX had increased in the past few months due to the donations from wealthy nations and also due to the easing of export limits on vaccines by India, according to a report by Reuters.Meanwhile, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the European Union’s (EU) drug regulator, said Omicron cases so far appear to be “mostly mild” while cautioning that more evidence was needed to ascertain the severity of disease caused by the variant.As many as 57 countries have so far reported cases pertaining to the new variant, according to the WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-of-covid-vaccine-hoarding-as-nations-begin-booster-doses-to-fight-omicron-101639062388454.html

Delivering the inaugural address at a conclave organised by the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad, Khan said several problems affecting South Asia, such as climate change, can be effectively tackled only if India and Pakistan work together. “There is only one big problem in South Asia. The whole of South Asia is hostage to the Kashmir issue,” he said, speaking in Urdu at the Islamabad Conclave 2021, the theme for which was “Peaceful and prosperous South Asia”. “It is with regret I have to say that we tried our best to have talks with India, I called [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi. Despite all the overtures we made, I slowly realised that he thought this was our weakness. There was some other reaction to all our efforts for peace, they were thinking Pakistan is making efforts for peace since it is very weak,” he said. Khan contended it was “unfortunate that we were not interacting with the government of a normal India, we were competing with an ideology”. He further said: “Our problem is only Kashmir and that problem can’t be resolved through guns and bombs. It can be resolved only through dialogue, and its solution is political dialogue...Whatever India is trying through the use of guns, strong arm tactics and repression of Kashmiris will never succeed.” There was no immediate response to Khan’s remarks from the Indian side. Ties between India and Pakistan are currently at an all-time low following a string of high-profile terror attacks in recent years that were all blamed on Pakistan-based terror groups. India has said that terrorism and talks cannot go together. On the other hand, Pakistan has contended that India hasn’t provided evidence to back up its accusations. Khan pointed out that the whole of South Asia and the region’s problems were connected. “There are two problems in our region – trade is very low because of political differences and conflict, and we are also connected in climate change. For this, we pray that India will one day have such a government with which we can talk on the basis of logic and sanity and resolve our problems,” he said. “We hope there will be such a government in India that we can sit with at the table and solve the Kashmir problem, and then jointly we can fight several things, such as the pollution in Lahore. See the satellite images – they show a pollution cover over Delhi and [Pakistan’s] Punjab,” Khan said. “Till the two countries sit together, no matter what we do for Lahore, we will solve only half the problem.” Noting that India is very vulnerable to climate change as Himalayan glaciers are rapidly melting, Khan said the future of the two countries in this area is connected. “We should jointly work hard on climate change but till now, I’m not seeing the required seriousness among world leaders because their commercial interests clash with the steps needed to stop climate change,” he added. Khan described the situation in Afghanistan as Pakistan’s “other big worry”, but said things could have been worse. “We feared there could be civil war in Afghanistan and this was the biggest nightmare scenario for Pakistan,” he said. The freezing of Afghanistan’s assets around the world is having an impact on the Afghan people and any humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan would present problems for Pakistan and Iran, Khan said. Referring to the possibility of a Cold War-like situation and the creation of blocs, Khan said Pakistan will work to stop such blocs. “We should not become part of any bloc. The world lost a lot because of the earlier Cold War...Pakistan doesn’t want to get caught up like it did in the last Cold War,” he said. Amid a Cold War-like situation between the US and China, Pakistan will try to stop the gap between these two countries just as it brought them together in the 1970s, he said. Reports have suggested Pakistan pulled out of the Summit for Democracy convened by US President Joe Biden because of its close ties with China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-asia-hostage-to-kashmir-issue-india-mistook-peace-overtures-for-weakness-imran-khan-101639060536154.html
09-12-2021||World||China may have played role in Pakistan’s withdrawal from US-led summit||A late night phone call from a top Chinese diplomat could have played a part in Pakistan’s withdrawal from the high-profile “Summit for Democracy” convened by President Joe Biden to be held on Thursday and Friday.Pakistan on Wednesday decided to skip the “Summit for Democracy” without giving any reason for doing so, giving rise to speculation whether China, which wasn’t invited to the international conference, convinced “iron brother” Islamabad, not to attend it.The Biden administration has invited leaders from over 100 countries and Pakistan was among the four south Asian countries invited besides India, Maldives and Nepal.The argument that China convinced Pakistan not to attend the summit is strengthened by the fact that Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi had held a telephone conversation with Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Friday night.During the phone conversation, Wang, according to the official news agency, Xinhua, “…expounded on China’s position on the so-called “Summit for Democracy” to be held by the US.”“What the US aims for is not democracy but hegemony,” Wang pointed out, adding the country is seeking to defend its dominant position in the world in the name of democracy.Wang said: “The US is trying to interfere with other countries’ internal affairs under the banner of democracy, abusing democratic values and creating divisions in the world”.“Many countries believe neither is the United States in a position to set tests and standards for others nor does it have the right to ask others to only follow its way of democracy,” Wang told Qureshi.“Wang stressed if democracy is to be discussed it should be discussed on the platform of the United Nations in the spirit of mutual respect and on an equal footing,” the Xinhua report said.Wang praised China’s system during the phone conversation, calling it the “whole-process people’s democracy”.China has full confidence in its democratic path and process, Wang said, adding that the “socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics is the whole-process people’s democracy, which has won wide endorsement and support from the Chinese people”.China, Wang said, is willing to conduct full exchanges with other countries on democracy and human rights in an open and inclusive manner, and jointly promote the cause of democracy and human rights around the world.China is also ready to work with all sides to uphold justice, reject the Cold War mentality, safeguard and develop true democracy, and earnestly defend the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of developing countries, he added. Unusually, no quotes were attributed to the Pakistani foreign minister, Qureshi, in the Xinhua report.Pakistan’s Express Tribune newspaper, quoting “official sources”, reported on Wednesday that Islamabad did consult Beijing on the issue.“One of the reasons includes the exclusion of China from the summit. The overall state of relations between the two countries is another major factor, compelling Islamabad to stay away from the summit,” the newspaper reported.China and Pakistan define their ties as “all-weather strategic cooperative partnership” with Beijing currently the largest supplier of arms to Islamabad.President Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road Initiative’s flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, passes through PoK.In November, China delivered to Pakistan the largest and most advanced warship, a frigate with stealth capabilities, it has ever manufactured as Beijing and Islamabad continue to strengthen their military capabilities against regional rival, India.Chinese state media reported the commissioning of the warship, quoting local and Pakistani officials, listing the vessel’s advanced capabilities, and noting that the delivery highlights Sino-Pakistan “all-weather strategic cooperative partnership”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-may-have-played-role-in-pakistan-s-withdrawal-from-us-led-summit-101639054236208.html

Nishiura’s study has not been peer-reviewed and published in a scientific journal.The study confirms the fears that omicron could deal the world a bigger blow than the delta strain. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has cautioned that it could fuel surges with “severe consequences”.However, a section of people still feel that the variant may only lead to only mild illness given a jump in cases in South Africa, where the variant was first detected, has not yet overwhelmed hospitals.The global health body recently said that early data indicates that Omicron may easily infect people who have either been infected earlier or vaccinated, but severity will be milder than what the Delta variant did or does.Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE have also said that a booster dose of their vaccine could fortify protection against the strain.The health community is trying to study the new variant, which is the most differentiated strain yet among the five variants of concern identified by the WHO since the pandemic began early last year.Cases in South Africa have rapidly increased to about 20,000 a day since the first infection related to Omicron was detected there two weeks ago. The number of Covid cases in the nation had remained low in the preceding weeks, despite only 26 per cent of the population being fully vaccinated, according to Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-strain-4-2-times-more-transmissible-in-its-early-stage-than-delta-study-101639044033421.html

Warning the nations that they would “inevitably” regret launching the joint diplomatic boycott of the multi-sports event next winter, China said that using the Olympic platform for “political manipulation” is “unpopular and self-isolating”.China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said, “The US, Australia, Britain, and Canada's use of the Olympic platform for political manipulation is unpopular and self-isolating, and they will inevitably pay the price for their wrongdoing.”Notably, Canada is the latest country to join the diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics, first initiated by the United States. The two other countries are Australia and the United Kingdom.Canada's prime minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday cited repeated violation of human rights by the Chinese government as the reason for not sending any diplomatic representation to the Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Games this winter.Similar reasons have been cited by the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, too, as the allies fester a growing discord with China over a slew of issues that have plunged relations into the most serious crisis since the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.The athletes from all these countries would still be able to participate in the 2022 Winter Olympics since the boycott is only limited to the level of diplomatic representation, according to the Olympic committees of the respective nations.Reacting to Australia's diplomatic boycott of the Olympics, a Chinese embassy spokesperson had earlier indicated that accountability for fixing the current predicament in diplomatic ties lies squarely with the Western side. “Mountains cannot stop the river from flowing into the sea,” the spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in Australia had said, noting that success at a multi-sports event such as the Olympics depends on the performance of athletes and not on the attendance of officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nations-launching-diplomatic-boycott-of-olympics-will-pay-the-price-china-101639037540405.html

The report further found that at least 293 reporters were imprisoned as of December 1 this year, said news agency Reuters.According to the CPJ's annual survey on press freedom and attacks on the media, 24 journalists were killed because of their coverage and 18 others died in circumstances that make it too difficult to determine whether they were targeted because of their work.The report by the US-based nonprofit further said that reasons for jailing reporters differed from one country to another but the record number was reflective of political upheaval around the world and a growing intolerance of independent reporting."This is the sixth year in a row that CPJ has documented record numbers of journalists imprisoned around the world," Reuters quoted CPJ executive director Joel Simon as saying in a statement."The number reflects two inextricable challenges – governments are determined to control and manage information, and they are increasingly brazen in their efforts to do so."Some of the journalists who were killed in 2021 include Danish Siddiqui, who died in a Taliban attack in Afghanistan in July, and Gustavo Sanchez Cabrera, who was shot and killed in Mexico in June.According to the CJP report cited by Reuters, China imprisoned the most number of journalists (50), followed by Myanmar (26), which arrested reporters as part of a crackdown after its February 1 military coup, then Egypt (25), Vietnam (23) and Belarus (19).For the first time, the CPJ's list includes journalists incarcerated in Hong Kong – a byproduct of the 2020 national security law, which makes anything Beijing regards as subversion, secession, terrorism or colluding with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison.Mexico, where journalists are often targeted when their work upsets criminal gangs or corrupt officials, remains the Western hemisphere's deadliest country for reporters, according to the CPJ.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/number-of-journalists-jailed-reached-global-high-in-2021-cpj-report-101639030495409.html

Zheng allegedly “used his status as a CSA engineer to negotiate agreements for the installation of satellite station facilities in Iceland. He allegedly acted on behalf of a Chinese aerospace company”, the RCMP said.Zheng is scheduled to make a court appearance on December 15. Meanwhile, the CSA said that when “concerns about this individual’s private activities outside of their employment arose, the CSA took actions, including an internal inquiry and restricting access to information. As measures increased, the employment ceased, in 2019”.It brought its concerns to the RCMP and actively collaborated in the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-police-charge-ex-staff-of-space-agency-for-illegal-activities-101639031491150.html
09-12-2021||World||Canada announces diplomatic boycott of 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced that his country will follow others like the United States in undertaking a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.Trudeau made the announcement in Ottawa and tweeted, “Canada remains deeply disturbed by reports of human rights violations in China. As a result, we won’t be sending diplomatic representatives to Beijing for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. We’ll continue to support our athletes who work hard to compete on the world stage.”The boycott was expected after Canada’s principal allies including the US, the United Kingdom and Australia already took such action.There was a vituperative reaction from the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa. In a statement attributed to a spokesperson, it said Trudeau had “falsely claimed” there were human rights violations by the Chinese government and “based on this groundless accusation” decided on the diplomatic boycott.“The Chinese side expresses its strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to this, and has lodged stern representations with the Canadian side,” the statement said.It also accused Canada and other Western governments of “been flagrantly engaged in political manoeuvring” based on “ideological biases as well as lies and rumours” in an attempt to “to disrupt the smooth progress of Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games”. “The Canadian side’s hyping up a “diplomatic boycott” without even being invited to the Games is a pure self entertainment,” it added.“Canada must stop politicising sports, stop disrupting and undermining the Beijing Winter Olympics immediately, lest it should lead to self-inflicted humiliation,” it concluded.The Canadian Olympic and Paralympic Committees issued a statement on the decision and said they “understand and respect” it. “We also recognise how this announcement draws the important distinction between the participation of athletes and the participation of government officials at the Games,” the statement noted.Relations between Canada and China have deteriorated in recent times, since senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was detained in Vancouver in 2018 on charges of allegedly defrauding a financial institution to bypass sanctions upon the Iranian regime. Days later, two Canadians, including a former diplomat was arrested by China. Trudeau described that as “hostage diplomacy”. After more than 1,000 days in captivity and being charged with spying, the two were released in September this year in what was seen as an exchange of prisoners and Meng also flew back to China after agreeing to a plea deal with American prosecutors.A pending decision on blacklisting Huawei from Canada’s 5G infrastructure could further damage ties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-announces-diplomatic-boycott-of-2022-winter-olympics-in-beijing-101639027828719.html

Since the first week of September, there have been nearly 2 million additional child cases,” the report said.Also read | Omicron may change course of Covid-19 pandemic, WHO warnsThe report said that severe illness due to Covid-19 was uncommon among children, but emphasised on the urgent need to collect more data on “longer-term impacts of the pandemic on children”. This also came amid widespread concerns over Coronavirus's new variant, Omicron, which scientists fear may be more infectious than the previous strains.Recently, the World Health Organization's office for Europe also said that the incidence of Covid-19 was two to three times higher among young children than the average population in some places.Also read | Coronavirus digest: Omicron reported in 57 countries, WHO reportsPointing out that rates of infection were high in the 5 to 14 age group, WHO Europe regional director Dr Hans Kluge emphasised on the need to “protect children and the schools” amid the rapid increase in cases among the young in the region.“As school holidays approach, we must also acknowledge that children contaminate their parents and grandparents at home, with a 10 times increased risk for these adults to develop severe disease, be hospitalized or die when non-vaccinated,” he added, according to news agency PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-europe-report-high-covid-19-cases-among-children-as-omicron-sparks-concerns-101639021866787.html

It called on countries to vaccinate as fast as possible and keep measures in place to protect people from infection.“We can prevent omicron becoming a global crisis,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a briefing on Wednesday. “This virus is changing, but our collective resolve must not.”The World Health Organization said the omicron variant of the coronavirus may change the course of the pandemic. It called on countries to vaccinate as fast as possible and keep measures in place to protect people from infection.“We can prevent omicron becoming a global crisis,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a briefing on Wednesday. “This virus is changing, but our collective resolve must not.”|#+|The organization also said while there’s early evidence that omicron is milder than the delta strain, it’s too early to be definitive. “Certain features of omicron, including its global spread and large number of mutations, suggest it could have a major impact on the course of the pandemic,” Tedros said.Asked about a new study from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE on how their vaccine works against omicron, Kate O’Brien, director of immunization and vaccines, said the WHO is aware and will look at the findings.“We are still in a delta pandemic, so vaccinate with existing vaccines continues to be the top priority,” she said.Earlier on Wednesday, Pfizer and BioNTech said initial laboratory studies show a third dose of their vaccine may be needed to neutralize the omicron variant, an analysis that will accelerate booster-shot drives around the world.The WHO has been pushing for countries to hold off on boosters to make more vaccines available to poorer countries where inoculation rates are low. But governments may be less likely to do that if evidence from tests continues to show that third shots are needed to protect against omicron.The variant has now spread to 57 countries, and it appears to be more transmissible than previous virus strains. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s emergencies program, said while omicron appears to have higher transmissibility than delta, “that does not mean the virus is unstoppable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-may-change-course-of-covid-19-pandemic-who-warns-101639021422990.html
09-12-2021||World||In China, 127 journalists under detention for covering sensitive topics: Report||Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit organisation that aims to safeguard the right to information, dubbed China the "world's biggest captor of journalists" as it claimed that the country is holding over a score of media workers under detention. Those journalists have been detained for reporting and publishing content deemed "sensitive" by the ruling Communist Party, the watchdog also informed in its latest report titled 'An unprecedented RSF investigation: The Great Leap Backwards of Journalism in China'."At least 127 journalists (professional and non-professional) are currently detained by the regime," it said in the report. "The simple act of investigating a “sensitive” topic or publishing censored information can result in years of detention in unsanitary prisons, where ill-treatment can lead to death," the international body added.More than half of those include 71 Uyghur journalists, according to the report. Since 2016, in the name of the "fight against terrorism", the Beijing regime has been conducting a violent campaign against the Uyghurs.The report elucidated how the Chinese government is forcing journalists to become the mouthpiece of their regime. According to the report, journalists need to undergo 90-hour annual training partly focusing on Xi Jinping’s "Thought" in order to receive and renew their press cards.Journalists are already required to download the Study Xi, strengthen the country propaganda application that can collect their personal data, as per the report.In 2020, China’s intimidation of foreign reporters, based on surveillance and visa blackmail, forced 18 of them to leave the country, it also said.In the same year, the Chinese Communist Party also arrested "at least ten journalists and online commentators for the simple act of informing the public about the Covid-19 crisis in Wuhan," the Reporters Without Borders also said. To this date, two of them, Zhang Zhan and Fang Bin, are still under detention in China.The Chinese Communist Party has long kept a tight grip on its press and flow of information to its public. However, some press freedom groups say the ruling Chinese Communist Party has tightened control over media since Chinese President Xi Jinping took office in 2012.In February this year, the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China (FCCC) said China used coronavirus prevention measures, intimidation and visa curbs to limit foreign reporting in 2020, citing responses to an annual survey of correspondents and interviews with bureau chiefs.The watchdog also stated that the government has increased the number of taboo topics for China. "Not only those typically deemed “sensitive” – such as Tibet, Taiwan or corruption – are subject to censorship, but also natural disasters, the #MeToo movement or even recognition of health professionals during the Covid-19 crisis," it said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-china-127-journalists-under-detention-for-covering-sensitive-topics-repor-101639021268979.html

But the disease will be milder than what the Delta variant led to, WHO said."Emerging data from South Africa suggests increased risk of reinfection with Omicron," World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters, adding that "there is also some evidence that Omicron causes milder disease than Delta".The new variant was found in the last week of November and since then it has now spread to around 57 countries. No death has been linked to this variant and patients are recovering without hospitalisation, without requiring oxygen support.10 things WHO confirms about Omicron1. Omicron cases have been reported in 57 countries across all WHO regions. While most of the cases identified in these countries are currently travel-related, this may change as more information becomes available, it said.2. WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said the variant is efficiently transmitting and probably more efficiently transmitting than Delta, but that does not mean the virus is unstoppable.3. Even if it turns out to be less dangerous, it could still affect more people, overburden the health system, as it transmits rapidly, WHO said. 4. Even if vaccines prove less effective against Omicron, as some data indicates, they are still expected to provide significant protection against severe disease, it said.5. Regarding Omicron's impact on vaccines, WHO said, "There is a need for more data to assess whether the mutations present on the Omicron variant may result in reduced protection from vaccine-derived immunity and data on vaccine effectiveness, including the use of additional vaccination doses."6. In South Africa, seroprevalence is 60 to 80% while vaccination coverage is 35%. But Omicron has spread rapidly as it poses reinfection threats.7. On the severity of Omicron, WHO said even if the severity is equal or potentially even lower than for the Delta variant, it is expected that hospitalizations will increase if more people become infected and that there will be a time lag between an increase in the incidence of cases and an increase in the incidence of deaths.8. Providing data of 212 confirmed Omicron cases identified in 18 EU countries till December 6, WHO said all these were mild cases. South Africa saw an 82% increase in hospital admission between November 18 and December 4, but it is not known whether Omicron is the reason.9. WHO cited the forecast of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control that if 1% of SARS-Cov-2 infections are due to the Omicron variant, it will become dominant in Europe by January 1, 2022.10. Though there has been no report of any severe disease from Onicrom, WHO said Interleukin-6 Receptor Blockers and corticosteroids are expected to continue to be effective in the management of patients with severe disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-may-have-higher-reinfection-risk-but-10-things-who-s-report-reveals-101639018760836.html

09-12-2021||World||Covid-19: In a first, US approves AstraZeneca antibody for cases reacting badly to vaccine||US health authorities on Wednesday authorized the use of synthetic antibodies developed by AstraZeneca to prevent Covid-19 infections in people who react badly to vaccines.It was the first time the Food and Drug Administration has given emergency authorization for such a purely preventative treatment.The FDA warned the drug Evusheld is "not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom Covid-19 vaccination is recommended" and can only be authorized for people who have a weakened immune system or those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons, such a strong allergic reaction.In those cases, the drug can be administered to people aged 12 and up.Evusheld combines two types of synthetic antibodies (tixagevimab and cilgavimab), and is given as two intramuscular injections, one straight after the other. These antibodies help the immune system fight off the virus by targeting its spike protein, which allows it to enter cells and infect them.The FDA said that the treatment "may be effective for pre-exposure prevention for six months."It cannot be administered to someone who is already infected with the virus, the FDA said, although AstraZeneca is testing it for such treatment.Side effects may include an allergic reaction, bleeding from the injection site, headache, and fatigue.The FDA authorization was based on a clinical trial carried out on unvaccinated people over 59 years of age, or with a chronic disease, or at high risk of infection.The drug was given to 3,500 people while 1,700 received a placebo. The trial showed that the treatment cut the risk of developing Covid-19 by 77 percent.Two cocktails of antibodies, made by Regeneron and Eli Lilly, are currently authorized for prevention of infection in the United States, but only in people who have been exposed to the virus shortly before, or who have a strong chance of being exposed, such as employees of retirement homes or prisons.In addition to being immunocompromised or unvaccinated, these people must also be at high risk of developing a severe case of the disease.la/dax/jh/mdASTRAZENECAREGENERON PHARMACEUTICALS||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-a-first-us-approves-astrazeneca-antibody-for-cases-reacting-badly-to-vaccine-101639014611916.html
09-12-2021||World||US Senate rejects Biden's Covid-19 vaccine mandate for private businesses||The Senate narrowly approved a resolution Wednesday to nullify the Biden administration's requirement that businesses with 100 or more workers have their employees be vaccinated against the coronavirus or submit to weekly testing.The vote was 52-48. The Democratic-led House is unlikely to take the measure up, which means the mandate would stand, though courts have put it on hold for now. Still, the vote gave senators a chance to voice opposition to a policy that they say has sparked fears back home from businesses and from unvaccinated constituents who worry about losing their jobs should the rule go into effect.“Every so often Washington D.C. does something that lights up the phone lines. This is one of these moments,” said Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont. At home, he said, "this issue is what I hear about. This issue is a top-of-mind issue.”Lawmakers can invalidate certain federal agency regulations if a joint resolution is approved by both houses of Congress and signed by the president, or if Congress overrides a presidential veto. That's unlikely to happen in this case.Under the rule, private-sector companies with 100 or more workers must require their employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or be tested for the virus weekly and wear masks on the job. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration said it would work with companies on compliance but would fine them up to more than $13,000 for each violation, though implementation and enforcement is suspended as the litigation unfolds.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Americans who have refused to get vaccinated are the biggest impediment to ending the pandemic. He implied that some of the resistance to mandated vaccines is based on politics.“Some of the anti-vaxxers here in this chamber remind me of what happened 400 years ago when people were clinging to the fact that the sun revolved around the Earth. They just didn’t believe science. Or 500 years ago when they were sure the Earth was flat,” Schumer said.Schumer said social media has played a role in spreading falsehoods about the vaccine, and “so has the far right.” He urged senators to vote against the resolution, sponsored by Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind.Republicans said they are supportive of the vaccine, but that the mandate amounts to government overreach.“His mandates are under fire in the courts. Main Street job creators are complaining against it, and tonight, the U.S. Senate must send a clear message: back off this bad idea," Braun said.Some argued that the mandate may even contribute to people not getting vaccinated.“I think, actually, the mandate has made it worse in terms of hardening people who don’t want to be told what to do by the government,” said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo.Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said a telephone town hall she recently held with constituents made clear they are concerned about keeping their a job if the mandate goes into effect.“If you look at my state, 40% of my state's workforce stands to lose their job under this mandate," Capito said. “It will be a killer to our economy."In the end, two Democratic lawmakers voted with 50 Republicans to void the mandate, Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana. Manchin had said in a tweet that he does not support any federal vaccine mandate for private businesses. Tester's office said his opposition is based on conversations with Montana businesses who “expressed deep concerns about the negative effect on their bottom lines and our state's economy during this fragile recovery period."Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., sided with the Biden administration, noting that the pandemic is still raging and that deaths are overwhelmingly among the unvaccinated.“How on earth does it make sense right now to undercut one of the strongest tools that we have to get people vaccinated and stop this virus?” Murray said. “In what world is that a good idea?”The White House released a statement earlier this week stating that Biden's advisers would recommend he veto the resolution in the unlikely event it makes it to his desk.“The president wants to see Americans back on the job, and Americans back at work should not face risk from those who are not vaccinated and who refuse to be tested," the White House said.Deaths in the United States stemming from COVID-19 are running close to 1,600 a day on average. The overall U.S. death toll less than two years into the pandemic could soon reach 800,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-rejects-biden-s-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-for-private-businesses-101639013803054.html
09-12-2021||World||Queensland detects new version of Omicron||ustralia’s Queensland state has found a new Omicron lineage in a traveller who arrived from South Africa, health authorities said on Wednesday.The new lineage has about half the gene variations of the original and can’t be detected with typical screening, the state’s acting chief health officer Peter Aitken told reporters. It was found in a traveller who had arrived from South Africa and tested positive for the coronavirus on Saturday, he said.The new lineage has enough markers “to be able to classify it as Omicron, but we don’t know enough about it as to what that means then as far as clinical severity, vaccine effectiveness”, Aitken said. “We now have Omicron and Omicron-like.”The discovery comes as the World Health Organization said on Wednesday that the Omicron variant has been reported in 57 nations and the number of patients needing hospitalisation is likely to rise as it spreads.“Even if the severity is equal or potentially even lower than for Delta variant, it is expected that hospitalisations will increase if more people become infected and that there will be a time lag between an increase in the incidence of cases and an increase in the incidence of deaths,” the WHO, in its weekly epidemiological report, said.But WHO and US scientists separately told AFP that Omicron appears to be no worse than other coronavirus strains.While it is likely more transmissible than previous variants, “the preliminary data don’t indicate that this is more severe,” the World Health Organization’s second-in-command told AFP.“In fact, if anything, the direction is towards less severity,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said in an interview on Tuesday, insisting though that more research was needed.Top US scientist Anthony Fauci echoed the WHO’s view.The new variant is “clearly highly transmissible,” very likely more so than Delta, the current dominant global strain, Fauci told AFP. “It almost certainly is not more severe than Delta,” he said. “There is some suggestion that it might even be less severe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queensland-detects-new-version-of-omicron-101639011646342.html

She then left office by motorcade for the last time as her staff looked on, applauding.Scholz led his Social Democrats from a deep poll deficit to victory in the September 26 election. The 63-year-old, who turned emulating Merkel in style and substance into a winning strategy, forged Germany’s first national “traffic light” coalition with the ecologist Greens and the liberal Free Democrats, nicknamed after the parties’ colours.Their four-year pact sealed late last month is called “Dare for More Progress”, a hat tip to Social Democratic chancellor Willy Brandt’s historic 1969 pledge to “Dare for More Democracy”.The alliance aims to slash carbon emissions, overhaul decrepit digital infrastructure, modernise citizenship laws, lift the minimum wage and have Germany join a handful of countries worldwide in legalising marijuana.Congratulations pour inFrench President Emmanuel Macron congratulated Scholz, pledging “we will write the next chapter together” while EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said she looked forward to cooperation for a “strong Europe”.Scholz’s office announced his first official visit would take him to Paris and Brussels Friday for talks with Macron, von der Leyen and Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg.Vladimir Putin said Russia was offering “constructive ties” with the new government, while China’s Xi Jinping said Beijing was willing to work with Scholz to “promote bilateral ties to a new level”.The new foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has pledged a tougher line with authoritarian states such as Russia and China after the business-driven pragmatism of the Merkel years.Greens co-leader Baerbock is one of eight women in Germany’s first gender-balanced cabinet. “That corresponds to the society we live in - half of the power belongs to women,” Scholz, who describes himself as a “feminist”, said this week.Challenging road aheadScholz and his team promise stability just as France braces for a bitterly fought presidential election next year and Europe grapples with the enduring aftershocks of Brexit.However, a vicious fourth Covid wave has already put the incoming coalition to the test.“We have to make a fresh start while facing down the corona pandemic -- those are the circumstances the new government is up against,” Scholz told reporters Tuesday.More than 103,000 people have died with coronavirus in Germany while new infections have surged since the weather turned cold, filling intensive care units to breaking point.Scholz has thrown his weight behind making jabs mandatory to get the pandemic under control, as Austria has done, as experts say the worst is still to come for the country’s struggling clinics.Merkel, 67, Germany’s first woman chancellor, is retiring from politics after four consecutive terms, the first post-war leader to step aside of her own accord. She leaves big shoes to fill, with large majorities of Germans approving of her leadership to the end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scholz-takes-over-as-german-chancellor-101639010915764.html

Extremist rebels were forced from power in Mali's northern cities with the help of a French-led military operation, but they regrouped in the desert and began launching attacks on the Malian army and its allies. Insecurity has worsened with attacks on civilians and U.N. peacekeepers.In June, Col. Assimi Goita was sworn in as president of a transitional government after carrying out his second coup in nine months. Mali faces increasing isolation from the international community over the junta's power grab. Elections are due to be held in February, though there are fears they could be delayed.Dujarric said the IED detonated in the Bandiagara region, hitting the vehicle carrying peacekeepers from Togo who were part of a U.N. logistics convoy traveling from Douentza to Sevare. The U.N. peacekeeping department said the soldiers were travelling in an armored personnel carrier.The 19 peacekeepers who have lost their lives in Mali this year include eight from Togo, three from Egypt including one who died Monday from injuries suffered in an attack in northern Mali last month, four from Ivory Coast and four from Chad, the U.N. said.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Malian authorities “to spare no effort in identifying the perpetrators of this attack so that they can be brought to justice swiftly,” Dujarric said.He said the U.N. chief sends condolences to the families, government and people of Togo and wishes a speedy recovery to the injured.U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield condemned the attack “in the strongest possible terms” and also called for those responsible to be held accountable.More than 87,000 peacekeepers from over 120 countries currently serve in 12 missions around the world, including about 16,600 in Mali.The attack took place as a U.N. peacekeeping ministerial summit was ending in Seoul, South Korea.U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix told the summit that over the last four years the U.N. has made notable progress in improving the safety and security of those serving in peacekeeping missions. But he reiterated that more needs to be done, including ensuring that missions have the required capabilities -- and more women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/7-un-peacekeepers-killed-3-critically-injured-after-ied-blast-in-mali-101639003687194.html
09-12-2021||World||Boris Johnson brings back ‘work from home’ guidance as Omicron tally reaches 131||U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson tightened pandemic rules to curb the spread of the omicron variant, advising people to work from home and mandating the use of so-called vaccine passports in large venues.“It’s become increasingly clear that omicron is growing much faster than the previous delta variant,” Johnson said at a televised press conference on Wednesday, announcing the measures for England. It’s the “proportionate and responsible thing to do to move to Plan B,” he said.Johnson Apologizes Over Christmas Party as Covid Rules Loom (3)The activation of the so-called Plan B restrictions follows warnings that the new Covid-19 strain will overwhelm hospitals, given the U.K. has recorded a high daily caseload for months even before omicron emerged. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland already had tighter restrictions in place before Johnson’s announcement.While the new rules fall far short of the lockdowns imposed previously, they still represent a significant change in approach and are politically risky for Johnson. The government had hoped an accelerated program of vaccine booster shots would mean no new restrictions would be needed over the Christmas period, after festivities were banned for many households last year.The timing is also sensitive as Johnson’s government struggles to handle the backlash over allegations his officials held a rule-breaking party in his Downing Street office last Christmas, which has provoked a public outcry. Johnson’s press secretary on Wednesday denied he attended the event last December, but the prime minister apologized in the House of Commons on Wednesday after a video emerged showing key aides joking about a party. One of them, Allegra Stratton, later offered her resignation in a tearful statement.The saga has angered even MPs in Johnson’s Conservative Party, one of whom accused him of using tougher Covid rules as a “diversionary tactic.”Johnson had previously said he would wait to see evidence of Omicron’s impact on hospitalizations and deaths before reviewing Britain’s pandemic rules. Wednesday’s announcement comes as the U.K. recorded 131 new confirmed cases of the omicron variant, bringing the total to 568. Neil Ferguson, a government scientific advisor whose modeling led to the first pandemic lockdown, said Wednesday that the incidence of the omicron strain is doubling every two to three days in Britain, meaning it will likely become the dominant variant before Christmas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-brings-back-work-from-home-guidance-as-omicron-tally-reaches-131-101638988872547.html
