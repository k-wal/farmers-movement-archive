Five other countries, along with the United States, have already announced a diplomatic boycott of the games to protest against China's human rights abuses.Meanwhile, China continues to deny accusations of forced labour or percussion of minority communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-signs-bill-to-ban-imports-from-china-s-xinjiang-into-law-101640277968830.html
23-12-2021||World||Airlines face uncertain winter as Omicron stalls travel rebound||Airlines face an uncertain few weeks as the spread of the omicron coronavirus variant upends what’s traditionally one of the busiest periods of the year for flight sales. Ryanair Holdings Plc slashed its earnings guidance Wednesday as travel restrictions related to the strain weakened Christmas and New Year bookings. Other carriers will likely be assessing their capacity plans, according to Bernstein analyst Alex Irving. “Ryanair, EasyJet and Wizz Air all operate in broadly the same market,” he said. “It’s highly unlikely the same pressures affecting Ryanair aren’t hitting other airlines.”Although airline stocks rallied Thursday following reports that omicron is likely not as severe as previous iterations, countries across Europe are bringing back travel restrictions and even lockdowns. Britain is battling record daily case numbers and France and Germany’s ban on U.K. travellers was part of the reason for Ryanair’s gloom.While Ryanair opted to update the market, other carriers may hold off until they report their next set of financial results, Irving said. In the meantime, close-in bookings are likely to be particularly impacted as people postpone trips.The latest variant has disrupted a nascent travel recovery that began in summer when Europe responded to a successful Covid-19 vaccine rollout by reopening borders and transatlantic travel resumed. Carriers had added capacity for the winter months, betting on pent-up demand in what’s traditionally a slower season for flights. The outlook for next year is still hard to assess, according to Irving, with everything dependent on how serious the omicron variant turns out to be. If it’s less dangerous than delta, as has been suggested by reports out of South Africa, travel bookings could bounce back quickly as governments relax restrictions. In the short term, bookings for Christmas may hold up despite the headlines as people prioritize seeing friends and family or take long-awaited holidays. Airport trade body ACI Europe said Thursday the omicron impact on European passenger traffic has been “immediate and substantial,” reporting a 20% fall in the three weeks starting Nov. 24. Still, passenger traffic increased by 9% last week as the festive season began and people maintained their Christmas travel plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airlines-face-uncertain-winter-as-omicron-stalls-travel-rebound-101640263780875.html
23-12-2021||World||China to send police advisers to Solomon Islands||China will send police officers to the Solomon Islands to help train its police force, the Pacific island nation said on Thursday, after rioting last month sparked by the country's 2019 switch of diplomatic relations to Beijing from Taiwan.The unrest, in which dozens of buildings were burnt down, arose after the decision by Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare to launch relations with China fuelled a dispute between the national government and the most populous province, Malaita. Other domestic issues also stirred the discontent.Six Chinese police liaison officers will equip and train the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force, a statement from the Solomon Islands government said.The Chinese equipment includes shields, helmets, batons and "other non-lethal gears that will further enhance Solomon Islands Police ability in confronting future threats", the statement said.Zhao Lijian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, told a regular press conference in Beijing: "China firmly supports the Solomon Islands government in safeguarding its domestic stability, bilateral ties and the rights and interests of Chinese citizens in Solomon Islands."Sogavare has blamed "agents of Taiwan" in Malaita province for the protests, in which dozens of buildings were torched in the Chinatown district of Honiara and shops looted, after the premier refused to speak with protesters.Taiwan has denied any involvement in the unrest.China claims the democratically governed island of Taiwan as its own territory and has stepped up military and diplomatic pressure to assert its sovereignty claims, fuelling anger in Taipei and deep concern in the United States.To counter China's expanding interests in the Indo-Pacific region, Australia has ramped up its presence in the Pacific via its membership of the "Quad" group, together with the United States, India and Japan.Around 200 police and soldiers from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea arrived in the Solomons capital Honiara within days of the riots, at Sogavare's request.Some Australian soldiers who had been deployed in Honiara began returning home on Thursday.Australia has a bilateral security agreement with the Solomon Islands. Australian police were previously deployed there in 2003 under a regional peacekeeping mission and stayed for a decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-send-police-advisers-to-solomon-islands-101640261795644.html
23-12-2021||World||UK PM Boris Johnson to hold next Covid update until after Christmas||Boris Johnson will wait until after Christmas to announce any new curbs to tackle the omicron Covid-19 strain, which has already pushed daily cases to a record daily level above 100,000.Any announcement will not come until the week after Christmas, people familiar with the matter said Thursday, when the government will give a Covid-19 update regardless of whether Johnson decides to introduce new restrictions.It means Johnson is diverging from the UK’s other devolved administrations over how to manage the pandemic. The prime minister, who oversees health policy only for England, has already promised he won’t tighten rules on hospitality and household mixing before Christmas but has left open the possibility of doing so after Dec 25.Governments across Europe, including in the UK, have already been forced to take steps to control the latest wave of coronavirus infections. The crisis has escalated with the emergence of the fast-spreading omicron variant.But Johnson faces a dilemma over whether to take further action after more than 100 of his ruling Conservative Party’s members of Parliament rebelled over the light-touch measures he has already introduced.They are likely to seize on two studies published Wednesday showing people contracting the new variant are less likely to need hospital treatment as proof more curbs are not needed.Risky dilemmaOn the flipside, his scientific advisers have warned that earlier action would help squash the growing wave and reduce pressure on the National Health Service. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, told BBC radio on Thursday that hospitals are under “incredible pressure” and that omicron poses a threat even if it is less severe due to the sheer volume of infections.“These are unprecedented levels of infection,” Paul Elliott, chair in epidemiology and public health medicine at Imperial College London, told Sky News on Thursday. “Even though a smaller proportion might get severe disease or go into hospital, that could still result in many cases and, of course, that could give pressure on the health service.”The spread of omicron is also affecting NHS staff, with absences due to Covid surging in London, the epicenter of the outbreak.Meanwhile the UK’s devolved administrations have decided the latest coronavirus wave is dangerous enough to change the rules. Wales on Wednesday announced new curbs starting Dec 26, including limiting gatherings to six people in hospitality and cinemas, mandating table service only in pubs and restaurants, and bringing in capacity limits on large events.Scotland from Dec 26 is limiting attendances at large events, and from Dec 27 it’s bringing in 1 meter of social distancing between adults in indoor hospitality and leisure settings from Dec. 27, and introducing mandatory table service in settings where alcohol is served.  And Northern Ireland is banning indoor standing events from Dec 26, and limiting gatherings in private homes and the size of groups in hospitality settings from Dec 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-to-hold-next-covid-update-until-after-christmas-101640260681887.html

23-12-2021||World||China’s Xian locks down its 13 million residents as Covid cases mount||The city of Xian in northwest China’s Shaanxi province with some 13 million residents went into a lockdown on Thursday following the detection of 234 Covid-19 cases since December 9.All residents have been ordered to stay indoors, communities have been put under “closed management”, and outgoing transport including trains and flights have been cancelled, health authorities said on Thursday as the city started the third round of nucleic acid testing for all residents.Thousands of contacts have been moved to centralised quarantine and put under observation.Starting Thursday, only one family member of each household is allowed to leave the house to purchase daily necessities every two days, city health authorities said.The city, known for the Terracotta Army historical site, has suspended long-distance bus services and banned taxis and cars hired on ride-hailing platforms for trips out of town.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases at 234 is low for a big city but given China’s “zero-Covid” policy, the lockdown is likely to be strictly implemented.City authorities directed movie theatres to suspend operations and prohibited dining in at restaurants; large-scale events have been banned and schools have either shut or moved classes online.Yang Zhanqiu, a deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told the tabloid Global Times the key reason for the lockdown “lies in the scale of community transmission in Xian and unclear epidemiological routes - the outbreak has demonstrated at least three transmission chains”. No infection caused by the Omicron variant has been detected in Xian.The local outbreak, according to the tabloid, has spilled over to at least four other cities, including Yanan and Xianyang in Shaanxi province, Dongguan in south China’s Guangdong province, and Beijing. The Chinese mainland on Wednesday reported 71 new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases, the national health commission said in its daily report on Thursday.Of the new local cases, 63 were reported in Shaanxi, four in Guangxi, two in Henan, and one each in Zhejiang and Guangdong, the commission said.As many as 29 new imported cases in nine provincial-level regions were detected, according to the commission.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland had reached 100,644 by Wednesday, including 1,823 patients still receiving treatment, of whom 10 were in severe conditions, official news agency Xinhua reported, adding that the death toll remains at 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-xian-locks-down-its-13-million-residents-as-covid-cases-mount-101640257632230.html
23-12-2021||World||Omicron variant has 37 spike protein mutations: Canadian study||Canadian researchers on Wednesday revealed, what they say, is the first molecular structural analysis of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 in the country which has shown that it has three to five times more mutations in its spike protein than any previous variant.A near atomic resolution analysis of the variant using a cryo-electron microscope, “reveals how the heavily mutated variant infects human cells and is highly evasive of immunity,” the Canadian researchers at the University of British Columbia (UBC), which conducted the study, said.Dr Subramaniam, a professor in the faculty of medicine’s department of biochemistry and molecular biology who led the study, described Omicron having 37 spike protein mutations as “unprecedented”.“This is important for two reasons. Firstly, because the spike protein is how the virus attaches to and infects human cells. Secondly, because antibodies attach to the spike protein in order to neutralize the virus. Therefore, small mutations on the spike protein have potentially big implications for how the virus is transmitted, how our body fights it off, and the effectiveness of treatments,” he said.The pre-publication study at bioRxiv noted the Delta variant had seven mutations in the spike protein and had only two in common with Omicron. “Analysis of the sequence of the Omicron genome suggests that it is not derived from any of the currently circulating variants, and may have a different origin,” the Canadian study stated.“Our experiments confirm what we’re seeing in the real world — that the Omicron spike protein is far better than other variants at evading monoclonal antibodies that are commonly used as treatments, as well as at evading the immunity produced by both vaccines and natural infection,” Dr Subramanian said. It was, however, less evasive of immunity created by vaccines than that produced through natural infection.“Sera from convalescent patients shows an even greater drop in neutralization potency relative to the Delta variant (8.2x decrease) while the vaccinated group also shows reduction in potency, although to a lesser extent (3.4x decrease),” the study said.This point was also stressed upon by Dr Subramaniam, as he said, “This suggests that vaccination remains our best defence against the Omicron variant.”

Washington has barred imports of goods from Xinjiang over complaints of mass detentions, forced abortions and forced labor, which Beijing denies.Tension over Xinjiang is rising as activists call for a boycott of February’s Winter Olympics in Beijing, a prestige project for the ruling party. The White House says the United States won’t send dignitaries. Beijing on Wednesday barred four members of a U.S. government religious freedom panel from China in retaliation for sanctions imposed by Washington on two Xinjiang leaders.“So-called forced labor and other allegations on Xinjiang are completely lies concocted by anti-China forces,” said a foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian. He called on Intel to “respect facts and tell right from wrong.”Some commenters online, where comments the ruling party doesn't want are deleted by censors, called for a boycott of Intel products.Intel processor chips are used in smartphones, computers and other products.The letter caused “concerns among our cherished Chinese partners, which we deeply regret,” said an Intel statement.“We apologize for the trouble caused to our respected Chinese customers, partners and the public,” the company said.Other companies including retailer H&M and shoe brand Nike have been targeted for criticism and calls for boycotts after expressing concern about Xinjiang or saying they would stop using materials produced there.The Chinese government rejects complaints of abuses in Xinjiang, but companies say they are unable to carry out independent audits of factories and other workplaces.Pop singer Wang Junkai, also known as Karry Wang, announced Wednesday he was pulling out of a deal to act as “brand ambassador” for Intel’s Core line of processor chips.Wang’s move is a “fresh warning siren to Intel and other foreign companies that seek to undermine China’s core interests while also trying to profit from the vast Chinese market,” said Global Times, which is known for its nationalistic tone.Other singers, actors and other celebrities have broken ties with foreign brands that were targeted for criticism over Xinjiang, giving up millions of dollars in income to protect their careers from official retaliation.Xinjiang is a major supplier of silica used in making computer chips. Intel has a chip factory in Dalian in China’s northeast — its only one in Asia and one of four outside the United States. The company also has a research facility in Beijing.Criticism by state media might prompt consumers to look at products based on chips from other suppliers. But there are few alternatives. The include Advanced Micro Devices Inc. of the United States for chips in desktop PCs and servers and Britain's Arm Ltd. for smartphones.The Communist Party has spent billions of dollars to build a Chinese chip industry and reduce reliance on the United States, Taiwan and other suppliers. But its manufacturers are far from achieving the level of precision required for the most advanced chips from Intel and other global suppliers.Intel, headquartered in Santa Clara, California, reported 2020 profits of $23.7 billion on sales of $77.9 billion.Smartphones and other products are designed to work with the characteristics of a specific chip from one supplier. Switching would require a design overhaul and testing.Trying to switch to alternate suppliers would be especially hard and costly at a time when a global shortage of chips due to the coronavirus pandemic is disrupting production of products from smartphones to cars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/intel-apologizes-for-asking-suppliers-to-avoid-xinjiang-101640253679302.html

This grant will go a long way in bringing to life the first-ever museum in the US dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi,” Kothari explained.EGMH has acquired 3 acres of land in southwest Houston to house the museum. The proposed budget for construction is USD 6.5 million.The proceeds from the capital campaign have touched USD 2.9 million, with the board of trustees committing another USD 1.1 million.The trust has also secured another USD 0.8 million from private donor commitments.Recently, the Houston Endowment Foundation also awarded a capital grant of USD 500,000.A concerted fundraising campaign is currently underway through foundations, corporations and private donors to raise the remaining amount.To initiate this project, the EGMH board has also engaged with a reputed museum consultant, with a Smithsonian background.The museum will also include exhibits and interpretations that highlight the mission and vision of Mahatma Gandhi.Additional consultants engaged for this project include a design and build museum firm, architect and an education consultant."The museum will invite Houston and school children from surrounding areas for a field trip for free.The EGMH will be an interactive museum divided into three sections: ‘His Journey’ (Mahatma Gandhi’s Life), ‘Our Journey’ (Impact of Mahatma Gandhi’s legacy of nonviolent conflict resolution in the world featuring, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Nelson Mandela and others around the world, and finally ‘My Journey’ where each visitor will be asked to make a commitment to make the community a better place to live in,” Kothari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eternal-gandhi-museum-in-houston-gets-grant-of-usd-457-000-from-fort-bend-county-101640253682356.html

Shringla, on a two-day working visit to Myanmar, met the State Administrative Council chairman, Gen Min Aung Hlaing, who has ruled the country since he seized power in a coup on February 1, and representatives of civil society and the opposition, including the National League for Democracy. The restoration of democracy and a complete end to violence figured in all these meetings, the external affairs ministry said in a statement on Thursday. Shringla also pointedly raised matters related to India’s security, especially in light of the ambush on an Assam Rifles convoy in Manipur’s Churachandpur district on November 13 that killed Col Viplav Tripathi, his wife and six-year-old son. The Indian side has for long sought to strike a balance between backing the democratic process in Myanmar and maintaining cooperation with the military, mainly to contain the activities of insurgent groups from northeastern states that have bases in the neighbouring country. Also Read: Myanmar hands over 5 RPF militants to Manipur Police: Report“During his meetings with all concerned, the foreign secretary emphasised India’s interest in seeing Myanmar’s return to democracy at the earliest; release of detainees and prisoners; resolution of issues through dialogue; and complete cessation of all violence,” the statement said. Shringla reiterated India’s “strong and consistent” support to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ (Asean) initiative on Myanmar and expressed the hope that progress will be made in a “pragmatic and constructive manner” on the grouping’s five-point consensus. The external affairs ministry said India has been involved in the democratic transition in Myanmar and has worked with various stakeholders in developing capacities for democratic systems and practices. “India proposes to renew these efforts for Myanmar to emerge as a stable, democratic, federal union in accordance with the wishes of the people of Myanmar,” the statement said. The visit was also an opportunity to “raise matters relating to India’s security, especially in the light of the recent incident in Churachandpur district in southern Manipur”, the statement said, referring to the recent ambush that has been blamed on the militant groups People’s Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK) and People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Shringla “stressed the need to put an end to any violence and maintain peace and stability in the border areas”, the statement said. “Both sides reiterated their commitment to ensure that their respective territories would not be allowed to be used for any activities inimical to the other,” it added. Any developments in Myanmar “have a direct impact on India’s bordering regions”, and peace and stability in Myanmar “remain of utmost importance to India, specifically to its northeastern region”, the statement said. Experts believe the instability in Myanmar’s border regions, especially the spike in activities of armed pro-democracy groups, has allowed anti-India insurgent groups to step up their activities in Nagaland and Manipur. The security situation has been further complicated by some 15,000 people fleeing Myanmar to take refuge in the northeastern states. While pointing to nearly 1,700km border that India shares with Myanmar, Shringla conveyed India’s continued humanitarian support for the people of Myanmar. He handed over one million doses of Indian-made Covid-19 vaccines to the Myanmar Red Cross Society. Part of this consignment will be used for communities living along Myanmar’s border with India. A grant of 10,000 tonnes of rice and wheat for Myanmar was also announced by the Indian side. The foreign secretary also expressed India’s continued support for socioeconomic developmental projects, including those in the India-Myanmar border areas, and commitment to the speedy implementation of connectivity initiatives such as the Kaladan multimodal transit transport project, which will link Sittwe port in Rakhine state to Kolkata port and the Trilateral Highway between India, Myanmar and Thailand. Shringla reiterated India’s commitment to continue with projects under the Rakhine State Development Programme and Border Area Development Programme. Besides senior representatives of the military junta and political parties, Shringla was also scheduled to meet Myanmar-based ambassadors and representatives of the UN.

Before the latest round, Apple shut and reopened eight additional locations, including stores in Texas, Maryland, Hawaii, Ohio, and Ottawa. The closures typically lasted a few days each.

In August, Apple also temporarily closed a location in Charleston, South Carolina.“We regularly monitor conditions, and we will adjust our health measures to support the well-being of customers and employees,” Apple said in a statement. “We remain committed to a comprehensive approach for our teams that combines regular testing with daily health checks, employee and customer masking, deep cleaning, and paid sick leave.”Apple has previously said that all its workers are tested regularly and that it only reopens stores once each employee is tested again. As Covid-19 case numbers and the omicron variant surge across the world, Apple has started to limit occupancy inside its retail stores to promote social distancing. It has also restored its mask mandate across all U.S. stores and has once again put in plexiglass dividers to protect employees. At the same time, Apple added an incentive to order online. On Wednesday, the company rolled out free two-hour delivery for its products in “most metro areas.” The deal runs through Dec. 24. That shipping option normally costs $9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-shut-8-stores-since-tuesday-amid-covid-19-surge-in-us-101640247412182.html

This did not include cases from the Northwest Territories, meaning that the total could be higher. The previous record high was 13,670 cases reported on December 28 last year, according to Esri Canada.The spiralling caseload is likely driven by the new more transmissible Omicron variant of Covid-19, and health authorities have already confirmed that community transmission of the variant has started in Canada.“In less than a week, we’ve seen a rapid acceleration of epidemic activity in locations across Canada. While Delta is still spreading in many areas, Omicron is increasingly responsible for rapidly rising case counts,” Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam said late Wednesday.“Modelling shows that by the beginning of January, we could have a very high number of cases, which underscores the need to act urgently to reduce the acceleration,” Tam added.The current surge in cases includes record daily highs being reported from the provinces of Quebec and British Columbia.

23-12-2021||World||Kim praises outgoing Chinese envoy Li Jinjun||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un praised outgoing Chinese ambassador Li Jinjun for helping to improve relations between Pyongyang and Beijing, state media reported on Thursday, as the envoy left office after seven years in the post.Kim's comments were conveyed to Li by Choe Ryong Hae, a top official in the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, state news agency KCNA said. Li also met with North Korean premier Kim Tok Hun, KCNA reported."Kim Jong Un highly praised the ambassador for successfully assisting several DPRK-China summit meetings over the past seven years, making much effort to develop the friendly relations between the two parties and the two countries and sharing bitters and sweets with the Korean people," Choe told Li, using the initials of North Korea's official name.Kim is very satisfied that the North Korea-China relationship has entered a "fresh heyday" under the leadership of the ruling parties in each country, Choe said.Li asked Choe to express his gratitude to Kim and congratulated the North Korean people on "making progress in all fields of socialist construction," KCNA said.China has been North Korea's only major ally since the two signed a treaty in 1961, and international sanctions imposed over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes have made it more dependent than ever on Beijing for trade and other support.Since Li was appointed in 2015, relations between the two countries have seen major ups and downs.Kim sent China-North Korea relations to a historical low by prioritising nuclear weapons and missiles development, then harshly criticising Beijing when it supported international sanctionsStarting in 2018, however, Kim managed to quickly repair ties and made his first known international trip as leader to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. Xi later visited Pyongyang, the first by a Chinese leader in 14 years.Li was one of a diminishing number of foreign diplomats in Pyongyang, as many embassies closed during North Korea's strict anti-pandemic lockdown that blocked the rotation of new staff or ambassadors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-praises-outgoing-chinese-envoy-li-jinjun-101640241885018.html

23-12-2021||World||Omicron: Doctor reveals 'telltale sign at night' to confirm presence of variant||The Omicron variant of coronavirus has left the world on tenterhooks, rapidly spreading across the globe and starting the surge on Covid-19 infections. The variant is highly mutated and believed to show a higher resistance to vaccines.There are also worries about the effects of the new variant on human bodies. Since Omicron is a relatively new strain, research is still on to fully understand its behaviour.So far, the results have shown that this new strain causes less severe Covid-19 symptoms, compared to early variants of the virus. Two more studies from Britain published on Wednesday showed that Covid infections with Omicron are less likely to result in hospitalisation compared to the Delta variant.But a doctor in the United Kingdom has revealed a new Covid-19 symptom caused by the Omicron variant - really bad night sweats.Dr Amir Khan, a physician with the UK’s National Health Service, told The Sun last week about the "telltale sign" - the sweats which are "those kind of drenching night sweats where you might have to get up and change your clothes”.This is apart from scratchy throat, mild muscle aches, extreme tiredness and dry cough reported earlier to be associated with the Omicron variant.Data coming out from South Africa, where the Omicron was first detected, shows that lower back pain could be another symptom.Dr Ryan Noach, the CEO of South Africa-based Discovery Health, recently said that the most common early sign was a scratchy throat and most of these symptoms are mild.The Omicron variant has been wreaking havoc in the United Kingdom, which reported 100,000 new daily cases for the first time on Wednesday. The United States is also battered by the fresh wave of infection, triggered by Omicron.On Wednesday, the US authorised Pfizer's anti-Covid pill for high-risk people aged 12 and above. Paxlovid, which comprises two types of tablets, was granted an emergency use authorisation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after a clinical trial showed it to reduce the risk of hospitalisations and deaths among at-risk people by 88 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-doctor-reveals-telltale-sign-at-night-to-confirm-presence-of-variant-101640231352885.html
23-12-2021||World||Hong Kong university dismantles and removes Tiananmen statue from campus||A leading Hong Kong university has dismantled and removed a statue from its campus site that for more than two decades has commemorated pro-democracy protesters killed during China's Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.The artwork, of anguished human torsos, is one of the few remaining public memorials in the former British colony to remember the bloody crackdown that is a taboo topic in mainland China, where it cannot be publicly commemorated.Known as the "Pillar of Shame," the statue was a key symbol of the wide-ranging freedoms promised to Hong Kong at its 1997 return to Chinese rule.The city has traditionally held the largest annual vigils in the world to commemorate the Tiananmen Square crackdown.The Council of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) said in an early Thursday statement it made the decision to remove the statue during a Wednesday meeting, "based on external legal advice and risk assessment for the best interest of the University"."The HKU Council has requested that the statue be put in storage and that the University should continue to seek legal advice on any appropriate follow-up action," it said.Late on Wednesday night, security guards placed yellow barricades around the eight-meter (26-foot) high, two-tonne copper sculpture.Two Reuters journalists saw scores of workmen in yellow hard hats enter the statue site, which had been draped on all sides by white plastic sheeting and was being guarded by dozens of security personnel.Loud noises from power tools and chains emanated from the closed-off area for several hours before workmen were seen carrying out the top half of the statue and winching it up on a crane towards a waiting shipping container.A truck later drove the container away early on Thursday. The site of the statue was covered in white plastic sheets and surrounded by yellow barricades. University staff later placed pots of Poinsettia flowers, a popular Christmas decoration in Hong Kong, around the barricades.Several months ago, the university had sent a legal letter to the custodians of the statue asking for its removal.Danish sculptor Jens Galschiot, who created the statue, said in a statement he was "totally shocked" and that he would "claim compensation for any damage" to his private property.Galschiot, who values the statue at around $1.4 million, had offered to take it back to Denmark but said his presence in Hong Kong was necessary for the complex operation to go well and asked for reassurances he would not be prosecuted.HKU said in its statement that no party had ever obtained approval to display the statue on its campus and that it had the right to take "appropriate actions" at any time. It also called the statue "fragile" and said it posed "potential safety issues."The campus was quiet early on Thursday, with students on holiday. Some students dropped by the campus overnight after hearing the news."The university is a coward to do this at midnight," said a 19-year-old student surnamed Chan. "I feel very disappointed as it's a symbol of history."Another student surnamed Leung said he was "heartbroken" to see the statue "being cut into pieces".The removal of the statue is the latest step targeting people or organisations affiliated with the sensitive June 4, 1989, date and events to mark it.Authorities have been clamping down in Hong Kong under a China-imposed national security law that human rights activists say is being used to suppress civil society, jail democracy campaigners, and curb basic freedoms.Authorities say the law has restored order and stability after massive street protests in 2019. They insist freedom of speech and other rights remain intact and that prosecutions are not political.China has never provided a full account of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. Officials gave a death toll of about 300, but rights groups and witnesses say thousands may have been killed."What the Communist Party wants is for all of us to just forget about this (Tiananmen). It's very unfortunate," John Burns, a political scientist at the university for over 40 years who had called for the statue to remain, told Reuters."They would like it globally to be forgotten."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-university-dismantles-and-removes-tiananmen-statue-from-campus-101640230784271.html
23-12-2021||World||Is Omicron the final wave of coronavirus? Read experts' predictions about future||Since the emergence of Omicron variant of coronavirus, the world has been wary of opening up and allowing normal activities to resume. The new strain is believed to be highly transmissible and resistant to vaccines.The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has brought the world to a standstill and again threatens to scuttle the holiday plans this year. The health experts have been studying the behaviour of the Omicron variant to develop new vaccines, or booster shots, for better protection of people.But will Covid-19 end after Omicron? And how will the virus behave in the next few months? Some recent comments from leading health experts have given a perspective.On Sunday, Dr Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner for the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, appeared on CBS News’ ‘Face the Nation’ where he said that Omicron will only be a “temporary incident” on the road back to normality.“I think people are really tired of living diminished lives from Covid generally. And you're seeing that in terms of what people are doing. They're reengaging activity that we know are going to be conducive to the spread of this virus. Omicron really has thrown a curveball here. I think that this is a temporary incident,” Dr Gottlieb said.He, however, warned that Omicron will “blow through” the US population very quickly. This happened last week when Omicron dethroned Delta to become the dominant coronavirus variant in the US, accounting for 73 per cent of new Covid-19 cases in the country last week.On Friday, executives of pharmaceutical major Pfizer, told CNBC that coronavirus will become endemic. “We believe Covid will transition to an endemic state, potentially by 2024,” said Nanette Cocero, global president of Pfizer Vaccines.The company’s chief scientific officer Mikael Dolsten added that the emergence of new variants could also impact how the pandemic continues to play out.Omicron was first detected in South Africa on November 24. Since then, the variant has affected people in more than 100 countries. In India, the Omicron tally has crossed 200-mark, with Delhi and Maharashtra being the largest contributors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-omicron-the-final-wave-of-coronavirus-read-experts-predictions-about-future-101640228453126.html
23-12-2021||World||New daily cases top 100,000 in UK as Omicron surges||British regulators on Wednesday approved Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine for use in children aged five to 11, as the country reported more than 100,000 new daily cases for the first time as Omicron surged.The developments came after the government said it was cutting the isolation period required for positive cases while Wales and Northern Ireland followed Scotland in unveiling new post-Christmas curbs, primarily around hospitality and large events.Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it had approved a new lower-dose formulation of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot after finding it was "safe and effective" for children aged five to 11.MHRA chief executive June Raine said there was "robust evidence to support a positive benefit risk for children in this age group".The "overwhelming majority" of reported side-effects from the two-shot "age-appropriate" jab related to mild symptoms, such as a sore arm or a flu-like illness, she added.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises UK health departments on immunisation, said it was now recommending a primary course of the vaccination be offered to some within the age group.Britain is in the midst of a stepped-up booster campaign, as it tries to minimise the impact of weeks of rising Omicron infections.On Wednesday the country surpassed 30 million third doses administered as it aims to offer the additional jab to all adults before the end of the year.Record infectionsThe variant is now the dominant strain of the virus across the UK -- already one of the hardest hit in Europe, with a death toll of nearly 148,000 -- as daily cases reach record levels.It announced 106,122 new infections Wednesday, the highest figure since mass testing began in the summer of last year.Earlier, the government said people who have tested positive can stop self-isolating after seven days instead of 10 if they have taken two negative lateral flow tests.Amid the skyrocketing case numbers, it could potentially allow many more to join family Christmas celebrations.Hours later, devolved governments in Cardiff and Belfast announced new curbs from December 26 -- leaving just England with no imminent restrictions unveiled.In Wales, socialising in pubs, cinemas and restaurants will be limited to groups of six people or less, while mandatory table service and providing contract tracing details will return.In Northern Ireland, nightclubs will have to close at 8 pm, alongside guidance to limit contacts with different households.It follows Scotland announcing renewed rules there Tuesday, which also come into force on December 26 for at least three weeks, and cap attendance at outdoor events at 500.The move means the pandemic has forced the cancellation of Edinburgh's hugely popular New Year's Eve street party for the second successive year.Antiviral drugs dealHowever, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has resisted calls to impose stricter rules in England over Christmas.The embattled leader, reeling from weeks of scandals and setbacks -- plus growing discontent in his own party -- has said he wants more evidence on Omicron's severity and ability to evade vaccines.Meanwhile his government has signed deals to buy more than 4 million courses of two new antiviral drugs-- Pfizer's ritonavir and US rival Merck/MSD's molnupiravir -- to treat Covid-19.Molnupiravir, sold as Lagevrio, is part of a national trial run by the University of Oxford that people can join if they have virus symptoms.Britain was the first country in the world to approve it last month and the authorities will make it available to those at high risk of severe illness, such as people with cancer.Pfizer's pill, marketed as Paxlovid, has yet to be authorised anywhere in the world.The company said Tuesday that clinical trials showed it reduced hospital admissions and deaths among at-risk people by almost 90 percent, when taken a few days after symptoms began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-daily-cases-top-100-000-in-uk-as-omicron-surges-101640227832186.html

Dr Leana Wen, a professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, said that it’s prudent to re-evaluate the plans “based on the risk-benefit calculation”.Also Read | British study on Omicron shows hospitalisation rate lower than DeltaShe further said that it’s better to use the “two out of three” rules. Dr Wen explained then explained the concept, saying indoors, when there's a lot of virus, people need two out of three layers of protection: vaccination, Covid-19 testing and masking.“If you want to go an indoor gathering where people are eating and drinking - and therefore unmasked - and it's an area with high viral spread, you need proof of vaccination and same-day testing. If testing isn't available, keeping your mask on gives that added layer of protection. If vaccination is not required, or if there are unvaccinated individuals in attendance, then masking in addition to testing will be protective,” she added.The number of Omicron cases have been rising in India too. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to hold a meeting to review Covid-19 situation in the country amid the renewed threat posed by the new variant of coronavirus.In national capital Delhi, the disaster management authority has asked police to ensure the restrictions on public gatherings, including on celebrations for Christmas and the New Year, are not violated. The cops have been ordered to carry out raids in case violations are reported.Several states in India have rolled out restrictions in the wake of Omicron spread. In Maharashtra, the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has said that gatherings of 200 or more people will now require permission for local civic body chiefs. The Karnataka government has ordered quarantine for primary and secondary contacts of all Covid-19 patients. Delhi, meanwhile, has banned “all social, political, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious and festival-related gatherings and congregations”. The DDMA has advised markets and offices to implement “No Mask, No Entry” restrictions at all shops and workplaces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-threat-don-t-cancel-holiday-plan-use-2-out-of-3-rule-says-expert-101640226800725.html

Serge Gellé, 57, the Secretary of State for the Gendarmerie, was discovered in the water by a fisherman in a canoe who brought him to shore, according to officials.Another passenger, Chief Warrant Officer Jimmy Laitsara, also swam to the beach at Mahambo.“My turn to die has not yet come, thank God. I’m well. I’m just cold,” said Gelle in a video posted to Twitter by Madagascar's defense ministry. "But I’m sad because I don’t know if my friends are alive.”Gelle appeared on a lounge chair, still in his military camouflage, his hands pale and wrinkled by the water and the cold.“There were four of us in the aircraft. I was seated behind the pilot," he said of the crash on Monday evening."Not having a life jacket, I unfastened the seat and used it as a buoy. I stayed calm and took off anything heavy I was carrying like my boots and belt. I did everything to stay alive,” he said. Gelle said he expected to be back at work in 24 hours and said that he lost his cell phone in the crash.Many in Madagascar applauded Gelle's feat, calling him a “hero” an “extraordinary athlete,” and “an example to follow” on social media.The cause of the helicopter crash “remains undetermined,” authorities said. Gelle said that gusts of wind had destabilized the aircraft. The helicopter pilot and another passenger are still missing.The helicopter was one of two flying a government delegation to view the site where a boat, the Francia, sank, drowning at least 64 people on board.On Wednesday 25 bodies were recovered off the island of Sainte-Marie, in the northeast of the country, according to officials.The small cargo ship sank Monday while it was illegally transporting 138 people, according to a statement Wednesday by the Maritime and River Port Agency.Efforts continue to recover the more than 20 people still missing, said the agency.The Francia sank Monday morning about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the town of Soanierana Ivongo.“A flood in the engine room caused the massacre. Obviously, the boat had exceeded its loading capacity,” said Maurice Tianjara, deputy director-general of the maritime agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/madagascars-police-chief-swims-12-hours-to-shore-after-copter-crash-in-ocean-101640224939761.html
23-12-2021||World||British study on Omicron shows hospitalisation rate lower than Delta||Two studies from Britain published Wednesday showed Covid infections with Omicron are less likely to result in hospitalization compared to the Delta variant, the latest research confirming a trend first identified in South Africa.The preliminary studies -- one paper from Scotland and the other from England -- were cautiously welcomed by experts, who nonetheless stressed that any advantage in milder outcomes could still be negated by the new strain's heightened infectiousness, which may still lead to more overall severe cases."We're saying that this is qualified good news -- qualified because these are early observations, they are statistically significant, and we are showing a reduced risk of hospitalizations," Jim McMenamin, a co-author of the Scottish research, told reporters on a call.The Scottish paper examined Covid cases recorded in November and December and grouped them by cases caused by Delta against those caused by Omicron.It found that "Omicron is associated with a two-thirds reduction in the risk of Covid-19 hospitalization when compared to Delta," while also showing that a booster vaccine offered substantial additional protection against symptomatic infection.The study was small and there were no people under 60 hospitalized at the time, but the authors said they had adjusted for these limitations using statistical methods.The second paper, from England, found there was a 20-25 percent reduction in any attendance at the hospital for Omicron compared to Delta, and a 40-45 percent reduction in hospitalizations lasting one night or longer, in other words, "admissions."The Scottish study only looked at admissions so this may account for part of the difference seen.Azra Ghani of the Imperial College London, who co-authored the England study, said in a statement: "Whilst the reduced risk of hospitalization with the Omicron variant is reassuring, the risk of infection remains extremely high."With the addition of the booster dose, vaccines continue to offer the best protection against infection and hospitalization."Neither of the studies has been peer-reviewed, but they add to growing evidence about disease outcomes with Omicron.It remains unclear whether the decreased rate of severe cases seen with Omicron is because of characteristics of the variant, or whether it appears milder because it is coming up against populations with greater immunity from prior infection and from vaccination.Penny Ward, a professor of pharmaceutical medicine at King's College London, who was not involved in the research, said: “This news does not detract from the extraordinary spread of this variant across the population, and the fact that even a small proportion of people needing hospital care for Covid may become a very large number indeed if the community attack rate continues to escalate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-study-on-omicron-shows-hospitalisation-rate-lower-than-delta-101640220053449.html

The Israeli military said troops shot a Palestinian who had fired at them from a vehicle.The incident followed several Palestinian attacks on Israelis in recent weeks. Palestinians also complain of attacks by Israeli settlers, whose residence in the West Bank the international community considers illegal.In a statement, the military said the soldiers had come under fire from a passing vehicle while searching for Palestinians spotted approaching the Jewish settlement of Psagot."The troops responded with fire and hit the assailant," the military said, adding that none of the soldiers was hurt in the incident.Palestinian medics said the troops had chased a car up to the entrance of a refugee camp and then opened fire, wounding the Palestinian man in the back. They said he was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.The medics said they did not know whether he had taken part in the alleged attack on the Israeli troops.The violence came a day after Israeli soldiers shot dead a Palestinian motorist they suspected of attempting to drive his vehicle into a military checkpoint near the settlement of Mevo Dotan in the West Bank.Tor Wennesland, the United Nations Mideast peace envoy, last week said he was "alarmed" by the recent escalation of violence on both sides, saying the situation had become "volatile."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinian-killed-in-west-bank-israel-says-soldiers-shot-gunman-101640215679965.html

23-12-2021||World||Pfizer’s Covid-19 pill wins FDA emergency-use authorization||Pfizer Inc.’s Covid-19 pill gained clearance for emergency use in the US, delivering a more convenient treatment option for at-risk patients at a critical point in the pandemic.The drug, called Paxlovid, is the first at-home therapy for Covid-19 to win clearance from the Food and Drug Administration. It is expected to become a potent weapon in battling the virus once production gears up, giving people at high risk of severe complications from the disease a way to avoid winding up in the hospital.“This authorization provides a new tool to combat Covid-19 at a crucial time in the pandemic as new variants emerge,” said Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the US Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in a statement on Wednesday.The spread of the highly contagious omicron variant has led to concern that the US health-care system, already burdened from battling a months-long wave of disease caused by the delta strain, could be further taxed by a new surge of illnesses. While the variant appears to cause less severe disease among the vaccinated, the large numbers of people in the US who haven’t had a Covid shot could be vulnerable to worse outcomes.President Joe Biden said in a statement after the approval that Pfizer’s pill is a “promising new treatment option” that will lower hospitalizations and deaths. He said the federal government will use wartime powers if needed to help Pfizer increase production of the pill, which Biden’s Covid response coordinator said takes six to eight months to make. “Even in the face of the more transmissible Omicron variant, America is more prepared than ever to fight this virus,” Biden said.The White House has indicated that it sees Pfizer’s drug and another pill made by pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. as crucial tools for alleviating the crunch for hospitals. Regulators are expected to also authorize the Merck pill soon, according to people familiar with the plans.Shares of Pfizer were up 1% as of 3:48 p.m. in New York, and have surged 61% this year.In a large clinical trial, Paxlovid was shown to reduce hospitalizations by 88% when given to high-risk unvaccinated patients within five days of symptoms starting. Adverse events associated have been similar between the drug and placebo in clinical trials, Pfizer has said.Limited SuppliesSupplies will initially be sharply limited before ramping up next year. In November, the US government said it had ordered 10 million courses of the Pfizer pill for a price of nearly $5.3 billion -- about $530 per treatment. It expects to have only 65,000 courses available right away, with 250,000 courses expected by the end of January, US officials have said.  “Pfizer stands ready to begin delivery in the US immediately,” Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said in a statement. Production of the pill is expected to ramp up dramatically next year, when the company expects to make 120 million courses.Until now, infused monoclonal antibodies have been the mainstay treatment for high-risk Covid-19 patients outside of the hospital. But those are complicated to administer and target the fast-mutating spike protein, which showed significant changes in the omicron variant. Two of the three main antibody treatments used in the US, from Eli Lilly & Co. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., may not work well against the heavily mutated omicron. By contrast, Pfizer’s pill targets a protein inside the virus that is thought to change infrequently. Pfizer’s lab tests indicate that Paxlovid will still work against omicron.In a clinical trial of the drug involving more than 2,000 patients, 0.8% of those who received Paxlovid were hospitalized or died during 28 days of follow-up, compared with 6% of patients who received a placebo, the FDA said in its statement.Side effects of Paxlovid could include impaired sense of taste, diarrhea, high blood pressure and muscle aches, the FDA said. The pill was authorized for treating symptomatic Covid-19 in patients 12 years and older at high risk of developing severe disease. It is taken twice a day for five days and is used in conjunction with a second drug called ritonavir. Between the two drugs, patients take 3 pills twice day, or 30 pills in total over five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizers-covid-19-pill-wins-fda-emergency-use-authorization-101640209962183.html

It will be able to deflect all types of missiles by jamming their systems," Fars said, on the third day of land and sea military manoeuvres in three of the Islamic republic's southern provinces.The agency also reported Iran's Revolutionary Guards land forces chief, General Mohammad Pakpour, as saying the tanks' main gun has a three-kilometre (1.9-mile) range and precision night-time capabilities.On Tuesday, Iran's military fired several missiles from land and sea as part of the five-day exercise.The drills are taking place in three Gulf coastal provinces, including in Bushehr, not far from the country's only nuclear power plant.The T-72 tank was first produced in the former Soviet Union 50 years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-announces-anti-missile-system-for-its-tanks-101640206514611.html

The authors of the study, however, cautioned that some of the reduction in hospitalisation and severity of the disease is likely due to high population immunity.The Omicron variant, which almost completely replaced other variants in South Africa in November, was associated with a rapid increase in Covid-19 cases in the country. Researchers across the globe are scrambling to gather more data on the new variant of concern as the high transmissibility of Omicron have forced governments to rethink the lockdown measures.The study used data from the national Covid-19 case reported to South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases, public sector laboratories, large private sector lab and genome data for clinical specimens to assess the severity of the disease. It assessed the severity of the disease by comparing the data of Omicron infections between October and November with data of Delta infections between April and November.The study, carried out by a team of scientists from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and major South African universities, has not been peer-reviewed yet and is available on the pre-print server. The findings suggest that the risk of hospitalisation from the Omicron variant was about 80% lower than those infected with the Delta strain of coronavirus."It is difficult to disentangle the relative contribution of high levels of previous population immunity versus intrinsic lower virulence to the observed lower disease severity," they wrote.Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain's University of East Anglia, said that the conclusions of the study are likely applicable to other countries since the paper “controlled for several of the main confounders such as age gender comorbidity.” Hunter, however, said that the study compares Omicron data from one period with Delta data from an earlier period, which is “always a weakness”.“There wasn't much delta around when omicron appeared. So temporal factors such as differing immunity likely to cause some bias,” he posted on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/reduced-risk-of-hospitalisation-in-omicron-cases-than-delta-south-african-study-101640198554539.html
