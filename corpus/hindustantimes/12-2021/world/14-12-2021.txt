Annual trade stood at a paltry $2 billion then (it’s over $145 billion now) and defence trade was zero ($20 billion in 2020). He also spoke of his visit to India as a teenager, along with his parents.Senators from both parties pressed Eric Garcetti during questioning to raise several issues with India, even as they appreciated the close nature of the partnership between the two countries and the upward growth trajectory. Two key issues they sought to task Garcetti - India’s purchase of Russian S-400 air defence missile systems that could trigger sanctions under a US law that seeks to punish Russia by scaring away its big defence clients, called the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA); and “democratic backsliding”, as one senator put it, and human rights.“I don’t want to prejudge the Secretary’s decision about sanctions or a waiver and I do want to tell the chairman and all the members, I do fully support the law of the land, implementation of CAATSA as law and here and part of that is the waiver provision as you mentioned,” Eric Garcetti said in response to a question about his stand on the India’s purchase of S-400s.“If confirmed, though, I would advocate following the continued diversification of India’s weapon system, the threats to our own weapon systems if that diversification doesn’t occur, because we have to protect our data and our systems and work towards really growing this Major Defence Partnership.”COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACYOn questions about “democratic backsliding”, a phrase used by Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and questions about the Citizenship Amendment Act, Garcetti said, “There’s no question that the US-India relationship should be underpinned by our common commitment to democracy, to human rights and to civil society (as enshrined) in our constitutions, both the oldest democracy in the world and the largest democracy in the world.”“And human rights, defence of democracy is a pillar of our foreign policy but to answer specifically, if confirmed, I will actively raise these issues or raise them with humility. It’s a two-way street on these, but I intend to engage directly with civil society.”Eric Garcetti has been the Mayor of the City of Los Angeles since 2013, following 12 years as a member of the City Council, including six as Council President.Garcetti co-founded Climate Mayors and led more than 400 US mayors to adopt the Paris Climate agreement, according to the announcement. He is the current Chair of C40 Cities - a network of 97 of the world’s biggest cities taking bold climate action and has led the organisation’s engagement and expansion in India as well as C40’s global response to the Covid pandemic through the sharing of best practices and resources, said the White House.Garcetti’s familiarity with the region owes also to his 12 years as an Intelligence Officer in the US Navy Reserve Component, Garcetti served under the commander, US Pacific Fleet and the Defence Intelligence Agency, retiring in 2017 as a Lieutenant.He is a Rhodes Scholar and studied at Queen’s College, Oxford and the London School of Economics and Political Science. His website as LA mayor says he is also a jazz pianist and photographer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-ambassador-designate-eric-garcetti-vows-to-help-strengthen-india-101639503960635.html

It’s clear that as we move forward, boosters could play an important role, esp. for those at highest risk of severe disease death"-@DrTedros #VaccinEquity“WHO is concerned that such programmes will repeat the Covid-19 vaccine hoarding we saw this year and exacerbate inequity.

The WHO also said that it saw “significant inequities” between various population groups within the same country.“If we end inequity, we end the Covid-19 pandemic. If we allow inequity to continue, we allow the pandemic to continue,” the WHO chief said.Further, the WHO stressed on Covid-appropriate behaviour such as facemasks, distancing and hand hygiene along with vaccinations. It also called upon vaccine donors and manufacturers to prioritise supplies to COVAX, the global vaccine sharing programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-against-boosters-but-inequity-and-vaccine-hoarding-who-chief-amid-rapid-omicron-spread-101639503107001.html

14-12-2021||World||Over 100 former army personnel killed in Afghanistan since August, Taliban responsible for at least 72: UN||More than 100 former members of the Afghan security forces and others have been killed after the Taliban took the reins of Afghanistan in August and most of them have been killed by the hardline Islamist group, the United Nations said on Tuesday.“Between August and November, we received credible allegations of more than 100 killings of former Afghan national security forces and others associated with the former Government, with at least 72 of these killings attributed to the Taliban,” UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights Nada Al-Nashif informed the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC).“In several cases, the bodies were publicly displayed. This has of course exacerbated fear among this sizable category of the population,” she further said.In her speech, Al-Nashif said that the country witnessed the highest civilian casualty this year even before the Taliban took over. Women and children represented close to half of all those deaths. While the harm to civilians, due to the fighting, has declined to a degree after August, they continued to remain at risk, she said. “... ruthless campaigns of lethal attacks are still being carried out by the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP) armed group as well as by other armed groups,” she noted.Also read | India’s move to send medicines for Afghan kids draws praise from Taliban“In Nangarhar province alone, there also appears to be a pattern of at least 50 extra-judicial killings of individuals suspected to be members of the ISIL-KP. Brutal methods of killings, including hanging, beheadings, and public display of corpses have been reported,” she added.Expressing concerns about the risk of children being recruited by Taliban and other networks such as ISIL-KP, she also noted that boys were becoming “increasingly visible” among security forces in checkpoints and as bodyguards.Regarding women’s rights, she said that the Taliban’s decree earlier this month left many questions unanswered. “It does not make clear a minimum age for marriage, nor refer to any wider women and girls' rights to education, to work, to freedom of movement, or to participate in public life,” she said.She cited a report by Unicef and said that 60% of the 4.2 million school children, who are out of school, were girls. In provinces where the Taliban had allowed girls to attend schools, absence of women teachers was a problem.“The continued participation of women in all aspects of life will be fundamental to Afghanistan's future. UN partners have estimated that restricting women from working could contribute an immediate economic loss of up to US$1 billion – or up to 5% of the country's GDP,” she highlighted.Drawing attention to the issue of threat from the Taliban to the civil society in Afghanistan, she said, “The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has documented 59 apparently arbitrary detentions, beatings, and threats of civil society activists, journalists, and staff of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, attributed to the de facto authorities.” She also said that the safety of legal professionals, particularly women, was a matter of “particular alarm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-100-former-army-personnel-killed-in-afghanistan-since-august-taliban-responsible-for-at-least-72-un-101639485339122.html
14-12-2021||World||China calls for UN-led regulation of military application of AI||China has for the first time submitted a proposal to the UN to regulate military application of artificial intelligence (AI) as its competition with the US over the dual-use technology intensifies.The document focuses on the “research, development, deployment and use of AI for military applications and proposes solutions on how to develop and use AI technology in the military field”, Li Song, Chinese Ambassador for Disarmament Affairs, said on Monday.The document was submitted to the sixth review conference of the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons in Geneva on Monday.China has pumped in billions in the sector over the years, and especially since the government unveiled the “New General AI Development Plan” in 2017, aimed at making China the leader in the field by 2030.Experts say AI will be the foundation of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) mission to become a “world class” military capable of rivaling the US in the next few decades.The inclusion of AI means the increasing “intelligentisation alongside mechanization and informatisation” of the PLA as per Chinese government documents.The PLA has already begun to deploy AI-driven technologies.The PLA Air Force has started to deploy AI as simulated opponents in pilots’ aerial combat training so pilots can sharpen their decision-making and combat skills against fast-calculating computers, the tabloid Global Times reported in June this year.“In addition to training pilots efficiently, AIs are expected to be an integral part of China’s future warplanes that would assist pilots with their combat decisions,” the tabloid reported.In the document submitted to the UN on Monday, China seems to be trying to create a level-playing field among countries with advanced AI technologies.“In terms of strategic security, countries, especially major countries, need to develop and apply AI technology in the military field in a prudent and responsible manner, refrain from seeking absolute military advantage, and prevent the deepening of strategic miscalculation, undermining of strategic mutual trust, escalation of conflicts, and damaging global strategic balance and stability,” the document said.“One particular concern is the long-term impacts and potential risks of military applications of AI technology in such aspects as strategic security, rules on governance, and ethics,” the position paper said.“We need to enhance the efforts to regulate military applications of AI with a view to forestalling and managing potential risks,” it said.The US Department of Defence highlighted the role of AI in a report on China’s armed forces released in November,“The term “intelligentised” describes “the PRC’s concept of future warfare based on emerging and disruptive technologies, particularly AI”. This includes intelligent technologies, systems, and operational concepts such as “attrition warfare by intelligent swarms, cross-domain mobile warfare, AI-based space confrontation, and cognitive control operations,” that facilitate information processing and decision-making on the battlefield. The report added that China is also updating its doctrine and warfighting plans to incorporate these capabilities.Quoting the report, the Council on Foreign Relations said: “China’s Academy of Military Science (AMS) has a mandate to ensure “that the PLA’s warfighting theory and doctrine fully capitalise on disruptive technologies like AI and autonomous systems” Through an emphasis on emerging technologies, China seeks to become a “global innovation superpower”.In the submitted document, China called for joint regulation of the sector and to establish an “universal international regime”.It called for countries to “adhere to the principle of multilateralism, openness and inclusiveness. In order to track technology development trends and prevent potential security risks, countries need to conduct policy dialogue and exchanges, strengthen communication with international organisations…”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-calls-for-un-led-regulation-of-military-application-of-ai-101639467373955.html

14-12-2021||World||Donald Trump’s inner circle was horrified by Jan 6 insurrection: US probe panel||Former US President Donald Trump’s eldest son and several Fox News anchors had begged the White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to get the president to call off the hordes of his supporters ransacking the US congress on January 6, contrary to their strident public defence of it.A committee of the US House of Representatives that is investigating the January 6 insurrection also recommended the criminal prosecution of Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows on Monday and released text messages from approximately 9,000 documents turned over by him.“He’s got to condemn this shit ASAP,” Donald Trump Jr, former president’s eldest son, had texted Meadows. “The Capitol Police tweet is not enough.”“I’m pushing it hard. I agree,” Meadows replied. “We need an Oval Office address. He has to lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out of hand,” Trump Jr texted back.Fox News hosts Sean Hannity and Laura Ingram, who are both loud Trump supporters, had also texted Meadows pleading with him to persuade Donald Trump to call off his supporters, which is quite the opposite position they have taken since, downplaying the insurrection. “Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home,” Ingram wrote, adding, “This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his legacy.”Liz Cheney, the top Republican on the investigation committee, read out these texts before she and the eight members of the panel voted to recommend criminal prosecution of Meadows for defying a congressional subpoena to testify about his role and what was going on at the White House at the time.The full House will vote on the panel’s recommendation sometime this week and if approved, Meadows will become the second witness to face contempt in this case.Steve Bannon, a former Trump aide, was the first when he refused to testify citing the former president’s executive privilege, a claim that was struck down by a court.Meadows also tried the same trick: Trump’s executive privilege - which, however, has been waived by President Biden. Only the sitting president can claim executive privilege, to retain the confidentiality of their communications, including of certain members of the administration.Meadows, who is a former member of the House of Representatives, had agreed to testify initially but changed his mind later. It was possibly because of pushback from Donald Trump triggered, among other things, by uncharitable revelations in a recently released tell-all book by the former chief of staff about his time in the Trump White House.Meadows had turned over approximately 9,000 documents and records to the committee already before he sought to shut down his cooperation by refusing to testify. They include the text messages US Rep Liz Cheney read out, blowing open the hypocrisy of Trump supporters who were privately revolted by the event they have publicly defended or downplayed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-inner-circle-was-horrified-by-jan-6-insurrection-us-probe-panel-101639462693820.html

Anand is just the second woman to hold the post of Canada’s defence minister after Kim Campbell in the 1990s.The country’s chief of the defence staff (CDS), General Wayne Eyre also issued an apology.Trudeau was asked during the course of a press conference why he had not delivered the apology himself. He reacted, “We profoundly regret what has happened and we apologise to all the survivors in the Canadian Armed Forces who should have never experienced the things that they did, when these people offered their services to our country.”The crisis came to light in February this year, as the outlet Global News reported that General Jonathan Vance, who had been replaced as CDS just a month prior, was facing charges of sexual misconduct. Vance’s successor Admiral Art McDonald stepped aside from the post before the end of February as he faced allegations of impropriety. In May, the head of Canada’s vaccine rollout programme Major-General Dany Fortin, was removed from that position as the military announced an investigation into similar allegations. At the time, he was seconded to the Public Health Agency of Canada as its vice-president for logistics and operations. And just last week, reports emerged of Vice-Admiral Haydn Edmundson, facing such charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-defence-minister-apologises-for-sexual-misconduct-in-armed-forces-101639462573581.html
14-12-2021||World||US Space Force holds war game to test satellite network under attack||The United States is testing satellite resiliency to threats from China and Russia miles above the earth's surface, just weeks after Russia shot down an aging communications satellite.The computer-aided simulations included potential shooting down of US missile-tracking satellites, satellite jamming, and other electronic warfare "effects" that are possible tactics in space warfare. Actual satellites are not used.During a visit to Schriever Space Force Base in Colorado, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks saw the 'Space Flag' simulated space training exercise hosted by US forces. It was the 13th such exercise, and the third to involve partners such as Britain, Canada and Australia."It happens in rooms like that ... people at a relatively junior level in many cases. Collaborating and thinking through challenges and trying to figure out concepts that seem to make sense and discarding ideas that go astray," Hicks told reporters en route to Hawaii.Pentagon leaders are touring US bases this week while the Biden administration's draft 2023 budget takes shape. The Department of Defense hopes to move budget dollars toward a military that can deter China and Russia.After Russia successfully conducted an anti-satellite missile test last month, US officials believe there is an increasing need to make the U.S. satellite network resilient to attack and to use opportunities like 'Space Flag' to train.Satellites are vital to military communications, global positioning navigation, and timing systems that are needed in the event of war.The 10-day-long space war game attempts to simulate the cutting edge of the US capability in space. The training exercise involved an adversarial group working to simulate an aggressor nation with space capabilities like Russia or China.Russia is not the first country to conduct anti-satellite tests in space. The United States performed the first in 1959, when satellites were rare and new.In Hawaii, Hicks will meet with Pacific military commanders and visit Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam where she will hear about water contamination issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-space-force-holds-war-game-to-test-satellite-network-under-attack-101639455723677.html

It is still widely regarded as one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history.In 2018, another massive earthquake shook the island of Lombok. Several more tremors followed over the next couple of weeks, killing more than 550 people on the holiday island and the neighbouring Sumbawa.In the same year, another 7.5-magnitude earthquake and a subsequent tsunami in Palu on Sulawesi island left more than 4,300 people dead or missing. (With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tsunami-warning-issued-after-magnitude-7-7-earthquake-hits-indonesia-101639453706036.html

Claiming open seas as their own. Distorting open markets through subsidies to its state-run companies. Denying the exports or revoking deals for countries whose policies it does not agree with,” he said.“Countries across the region want this behaviour to change – we do too,” he added.He added that Washington was “determined to ensure freedom of navigation in the South China Sea”, and said Beijing's actions there threaten the movement of more than $3 trillion worth of commerce every year.China claims almost all of the resource-rich sea, with competing claims from four Southeast Asian states as well as Taiwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hits-out-at-china-s-moves-in-indo-pacific-seeks-allies-in-asia-101639453106122.html
14-12-2021||World||Since last December, 199 million new Covid cases, 3.4 million deaths logged globally||In the span of one year, about 199 million people have contracted the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) globally, with more than 3.4 million succumbing, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).The coronavirus pandemic has not subsided even as vaccines have become widely available and the infectious disease protocols more ingrained in everyday life.Omicron, a new variant of SARS-Cov-2, said to be even more infectious than Delta, the key driver behind the second and third waves of the pandemic, has recently escalated concern among countries and experts. Omicron is inherently capable of undergoing frequent mutations that need extensive studies yet.According to the updates provided weekly by the WHO there were more than 70 million Covid-19 cases and almost 1.6 million deaths reported globally, on December 13, 2020.A year later, the coronavirus tracker of the international public health body on December 14, 2021, shows that 269 million Covid-19 cases and five million related deaths have so far been reported.“Globally, as of 4:51pm CET, 13 December 2021, there have been 269,468,311 confirmed cases of Covid-19, including 5,304,248 deaths, reported to WHO,” the UN agency noted on its dashboard.“As of 12 December 2021, a total of 8,200,642,671 vaccine doses have been administered,” it said.Around this time in December last year, the Americas and Europe were the regions primarily shouldering the burden of the pandemic.According to the WHO epidemiological report of December 13, 2020, the continents combined accounted for 85 per cent of all new Covid-19 cases and 86 per cent of new deaths that week.The African and the Western-Pacific region also showed a renewed rise in cases during November and December and the number of hospitalisations and fatalities in Southeast Asia declined following a peak in September.The five countries reporting the highest number of cases globally that week were the United States, Brazil, Turkey, India, and Russia, with the rising infections being partly attributed to the selective reopening of economies and the approaching holiday season.In India, Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat and Rajasthan were then among some of the most affected areas by the coronavirus pandemic.The world was, of course, much less equipped to deal with the pandemic as it is now. The first vaccine against Covid-19 was administered on December 9, 2020, marking what the then UK health secretary Matt Hancock called “the start of the fightback against our common enemy, the coronavirus.”Since then, leading pharmaceutical giants such as Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson have partnered up with researchers to churn out millions of vaccine doses and world governments have distributed them throughout the globe.As of this day, 8.47 billion doses of Covid‑19 vaccines have been administered worldwide based on official reports from national public health agencies.Countries have also selectively reopened their economies, with ‘vaccine passports’ put in place in certain jurisdictions as part of efforts to control the spread of the infectious disease. According to data issued by public health authorities, around 56 per cent of the world population presently remains vaccinated with both doses of the shot.However, it is also true that the threat of the pandemic continues to linger, with countries now instituting booster doses to replenish the waning immunity delivered by the Covid-19 shots.The Americas and Europe continue to add more Covid-19 cases, with the continents collectively reporting around 98 million and 91 million confirmed infections, respectively. Southeast Asia, with its 44 million cases, is close behind, amid fears of emergent strains of the virus.Amid all this, WHO recommends strict adherence to all necessary pandemic-related protocols.The following are the norms that need to be followed:• Get vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn and follow local guidance on vaccination.• Keep a physical distance of at least 1 metre from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick. Avoid crowds and close contact.• Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible and in poorly ventilated settings.• Clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.• Cover your mouth and nose with a bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze.

Since then, warnings have been issued by several national cybersecurity agencies, including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and Germany's federal cybersecurity watchdog, the BSI.Also read | Log4j vulnerability sends cyber defenders scrambling“To be clear, this vulnerability poses a severe risk,” CISA director Jen Easterly said in a statement Friday. “We are taking urgent action to drive mitigation of this vulnerability and detect any associated threat activity,” Easterly said.She added vendors “must immediately identify, mitigate, and patch the wide array of products using this software.”What is Log4j?Log4j is open-source software maintained by a group of volunteer programmers as part of the nonprofit Apache Software Foundation and is a key Java-logging framework. Through Log4j, which security experts said is used by millions of applications, that developers can put into applications to monitor, or 'log’, which can help programmers debug software.Also read | SolarWinds hack: US weighs ‘seen and unseen’ responses to major cyber attackApache noted in its security advisory the issue was first publicly disclosed by a security researcher working for Chinese technology company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The flaw in the Log4j software could allow hackers unfettered access to computer systems. Reports have said the initial exploitation was spotted on December 2, before a patch rolled out a few days later. While a partial fix for the vulnerability was released on Friday by Apache, the maker of Log4j.What are companies doing to fix software exploit?Major global companies, including Microsoft Corp and Cisco Inc, are facing pressure to fix what experts are calling one of the most serious software flaws in recent memory. Microsoft and Cisco have published advisories about the flaw, and software developers released a fix late last week. VMware has also released patches for its affected products respectively. Also read | 4,000 cyber-attacks on India’s Botanical Survey website in 2 monthsOracle has issued a patch for the flaw, too. "Due to the severity of this vulnerability and the publication of exploit code on various sites, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply the updates provided by this Security Alert as soon as possible," it said. AWS, which has detailed how the flaw impacts its services, said it is working on patching its services that use Log4j and has released mitigations for services like CloudFront.     IBM, which has confirmed Websphere 8.5 and 9.0 are vulnerable, said it is "actively responding" to the Log4j vulnerability across its infrastructure and its products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/log4j-vulnerability-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-software-bug-101639442698904.html
14-12-2021||World||Log4j vulnerability sends cyber defenders scrambling||A newly discovered vulnerability in a widely used software library is causing mayhem on the internet, forcing cyber defenders to scramble as hackers rush to exploit the weakness.The vulnerability, known as Log4j, comes from a popular open source product that helps software developers track changes in applications that they build. It is so popular and embedded across many companies' programs that security executives expect widespread abuse."The Apache Log4j Remote Code Execution Vulnerability is the single biggest, most critical vulnerability of the last decade," said Amit Yoran, chief executive of Tenable, a network security firm, and the founding director of the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team.The US government sent a warning to the private sector about the Log4j vulnerability and the looming risk it poses on Friday.In a conference call on Monday, the leader of CISA said it was one of the worst vulnerabilities seen in many years. She urged companies to have staff working through the holidays to battle those using new methods to exploit the flaw.Much of the software affected by Log4j, which bears names like Hadoop or Solr, may be unfamiliar to the public at large. But as with the SolarWinds program at the center of a massive Russian espionage operation last year, the ubiquity of these workhorse programs makes them ideal jumping-off points for digital intruders.Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade, principal threat researcher with cybersecurity firm SentinelOne, called it "one of those nightmare vulnerabilities that there’s pretty much no way to prepare for."While a partial fix for the vulnerability was released on Friday by Apache, the maker of Log4j, affected companies and cyber defenders will need time to locate the vulnerable software and properly implement patches. Log4j itself is maintained by a few volunteers, security experts said.In practice, the flaw allows an outsider to enter active code into the record-keeping process. That code then tells the server hosting the software to execute a command giving the hacker control.The issue was first publicly disclosed by a security researcher working for Chinese technology company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Apache noted in its security advisory.It is now apparent that initial exploitation was spotted Dec. 2, before a patch rolled out a few days later. The attacks became much more widespread as people playing Minecraft used it to take control of servers and spread the word in gaming chats.So far no major disruptive cyber incidents have been publicly documented as a result of the vulnerability, but researchers are seeing an alarming uptick in hacking groups trying to take advantage of the bug for espionage."We also expect to see this vulnerability in everyone’s supply chain," said Chris Evans, chief information security officer at HackerOne.Multiple botnets, or groups of computers controlled by criminals, were also exploiting the flaw in a bid to add more captive machines, experts tracking the developments said.What many experts now fear is that the bug could be used to deploy malware that either destroys data or encrypts it, like what was used against U.S. pipeline operator Colonial Pipeline in May which led to shortages of gasoline in some parts of the United States.Guerrero-Saade said his firm had already seen Chinese hacking groups moving to take advantage of the vulnerability.US cybersecurity firms Mandiant and Crowdstrike also said they found sophisticated hacking groups leveraging the bug to breach targets. Mandiant described those hackers as "Chinese government actors" in an email to Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/log4j-vulnerability-sends-cyber-defenders-scrambling-101639440064386.html

In a temporary order on Monday, they said no more than five people could congregate, while restaurants must not allow indoor dining after 10 p.m."So what we're seeing in Ontario, I expect to be seen in other areas of the country, as has been seen in Europe and other areas of the world," chief public health officer Theresa Tam told a news conference."But for sure we are seeing community transmission, possibly in its early stages, but this can rapidly escalate in the days to come," she added, after announcing recommendations to improve the Canadian public health system in a report to the parliament.Canada needs to hire more health workers, improve technology and governance, as well as provide more stable funding, she said in the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-could-see-uptick-in-covid-cases-as-omicron-spreads-report-101639438557350.html

A trait distinguishing Omicron from the dominant Delta variant suggests a much higher total, said the National Public Health Emergency Team."Using this methodology, we estimate that 11% of cases are now due to the Omicron variant, an increase from less than 1% only one week ago," Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan said in a statement.Just over 90% of Ireland's eligible 3.9 million people over the age of 12 have been fully vaccinated - one of the highest rates of protection in Europe - and it has administered a further 1.2 million booster doses.The government, which has shut nightclubs and placed limits on the capacity and opening hours of bars, restaurants and indoor events, has promised to speed up the booster campaign this week.It will also cut the gap between completion of the primary schedule of COVID-19 vaccination and a booster dose to three months from five months, Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said on Monday,While the number of COVID-19 infections have stabilised at near-record levels in recent weeks, the proportion of people testing positive is falling gradually, along with the numbers in hospital and in need of critical care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ireland-says-omicron-accounts-for-11-of-its-covid-19-cases-101639437477929.html

Gavin Newsom’s administration announced the new mandate will start Wednesday and last until Jan. 15. The order comes as the per capita rate of new coronavirus cases in California has jumped 47% in the past two weeks.“We know people are tired and hungry for normalcy. Frankly, I am too,” California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said Monday. “That said, this is a critical time where we have a tool that we know has worked and can work."California lifted its statewide mask mandate on June 15 for people who were vaccinated, a date Newsom heralded as the state's grand reopening. But since then, county governments covering about half of the state's population have imposed their own indoor mask mandates as case rates surged with new variants.The state's new mask mandate will cover everyone else, but state officials on Monday were unclear about whether it would be enforced. Ghaly said enforcement would likely be stronger in some places than others, but he urged Californians to heed the warnings and wear masks.“We know that t here's going to be people who don't necessarily agree with this, who are tired, who aren't going to mask,” Ghaly said. “We hope that those are few and far between, that most people see the purpose of doing this over the next month as something to protect them and their communities during a very tough time.”California also is tightening existing testing requirements by ordering unvaccinated people attending indoor events of 1,000 people or more to have a negative test within one or two days, depending on the type of test. The state also is recommending travelers who visit or return to California to get tested within five days of their arrival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-reinstates-statewide-mask-mandate-amid-rise-in-covid-19-cases-101639434247219.html
14-12-2021||World||Kentucky tornadoes: US to probe Amazon warehouse fatal collapse in Illinois||The US workplace safety watchdog is investigating the circumstances around the collapse during Friday night's storm of an Amazon.com Inc building in Illinois in which six workers died, an official at the U.S. Department of Labor said on Monday.The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has six months to complete its investigation, issue citations, and propose monetary penalties if violations of workplace safety and/or health regulations are found, Scott Allen, a US Department of Labor regional director for public affairs, said via email. He added that compliance officers have been on site since Saturday.Six workers were killed when the Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, Illinois, buckled under the force of a devastating storm, police said. A barrage of tornadoes ripped through six US states, leaving a trail of death and destruction at homes and businesses stretching more than 200 miles (322 km).Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said the company would cooperate with the investigation. "OSHA investigates all workplace fatalities and we are supporting them," she said.Responding to a reporter, Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker said officials are investigating the condition of the warehouse before it gave way."Already there has been an effort to determine some of the challenges ... if there were any structural issues, what exactly the storm's trajectory was coming in and affecting the various pieces of the building," Pritzker said.Tornado timelineThe National Weather Service said a tornado hit the area around 8:30 p.m. CST on Friday, intensifying rapidly as it struck the Amazon warehouse. Peak winds were estimated at 150 miles per hour (241 kph), causing severe damage.The site received tornado warnings between 8:06 p.m. and 8:16 p.m. before the tornado struck the building at 8:27 p.m., Amazon said.Several employees told Reuters over the weekend that workers had been directed by Amazon managers to shelter in bathrooms after receiving emergency alerts on mobile phones from authorities. At least one worker died there, according to his co-worker.Amazon said employees were directed to shelter in place at a designated assembly area at the front of the building, which was near a restroom.Some of the workers told Reuters they had mobile phones with them despite what they believed was an Amazon policy preventing them from having the phones in their possession while at work. Amazon said there was no policy preventing employees or contractors from having phones at work.Edwardsville, a city of 27,000, is about 18 miles northeast of St. Louis, Missouri.The company has three facilities in Edwardsville: the delivery station hit by the storm, as well as a fulfillment center and a sorting station. The delivery station opened in July 2020 to prepare orders for last-mile delivery to customers.The site, a compound comprised of a few buildings, has been under heavy private and police security through the weekend, accessible only to relief teams and some Amazon and government officials. The remains of the destroyed warehouse were mostly dismantled, reduced to rubble.“It was crazy – I was on my way into the warehouse from Pontoon Beach (Illinois) when it happened. I saw the storm and was trying to get in as quickly as possible," said Brady Robison, 22, an Amazon van driver who works at the facility."I just saw the roof completely tilted up ... it’s messed up that people had to lose their lives while they were at work.”At least 45 Amazon employees made it out safely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kentucky-tornadoes-us-to-probe-amazon-warehouse-fatal-collapse-in-illinois-101639434326230.html

14-12-2021||World||Thousands without water, heat after tornadoes kill more than 88 in US' Kentucky||Residents of Kentucky counties where tornadoes killed dozens of people could be without heat, water or electricity in frigid temperatures for weeks or longer, state officials warned Monday, as the toll of damage and deaths came into clearer focus in five states slammed by the swarm of twisters.Kentucky authorities said the sheer level of destruction was hindering their ability to tally the damage from Friday night's storms. At least 88 people — including 74 in Kentucky — were killed by the tornado outbreak that also destroyed a nursing home in Arkansas, heavily damaged an Amazon distribution center in Illinois and spread its deadly effects into Tennessee and Missouri.In Kentucky, as searches continued for those still missing, efforts also turned to repairing the power grid, sheltering those whose homes were destroyed and delivering drinking water and other supplies.“We’re not going to let any of our families go homeless," Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said in announcing that lodges in state parks were being used to provide shelter.In Mayfield, one of the hardest hit towns, those who survived faced a high in the 50s and a low below freezing Monday without any utilities.“Our infrastructure is so damaged. We have no running water. Our water tower was lost. Our wastewater management was lost, and there’s no natural gas to the city. So we have nothing to rely on there,” Mayfield Mayor Kathy Stewart O’Nan said on ”CBS Mornings.” “So that is purely survival at this point for so many of our people.”Across the state, about 26,000 homes and businesses were without electricity, according to poweroutage.us, including nearly all of those in Mayfield. More than 10,000 homes and businesses have no water, and another 17,000 are under boil-water advisories, Kentucky Emergency Management Director Michael Dossett told reporters.Kentucky was the worst hit by far in the cluster of twisters across several states, remarkable because they came at a time of year when cold weather normally limits tornadoes. At least 74 people died in the state, Beshear said Monday, offering the first specific count of the dead.Still, Beshear warned that it could take days longer to pin down the full death toll, with door-to-door searches impossible in some places.“With this amount of damage and rubble, it may be a week or even more before we have a final count on the number of lost lives,” the governor said.Initially as many as 70 people were feared dead in the Mayfield Consumer Products candle factory, but the company said Sunday that eight deaths were confirmed and eight people remained missing, while more than 90 others had been located. Bob Ferguson, a spokesman for the company, said many employees gathered in a tornado shelter, then left the site and were hard to reach because phone service was out.Debris from destroyed buildings and shredded trees covered the ground in Mayfield, a city of about 10,000 in western Kentucky. Twisted sheet metal, downed power lines and wrecked vehicles lined the streets. Windows were blown out and roofs torn off the buildings that were still standing.Five twisters hit Kentucky in all, including one with an extraordinarily long path of about 200 miles (322 kilometers), authorities said.In addition to the deaths in Kentucky, the tornadoes also killed at least six people in Illinois, where the Amazon distribution center in Edwardsville was hit; four in Tennessee; two in Arkansas, where the nursing home was destroyed and the governor said workers shielded residents with their own bodies; and two in Missouri.The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration announced Monday that it has opened an investigation into the collapse of the Amazon warehouse in Illinois.Amazon’s Kelly Nantel said the Illinois warehouse was “constructed consistent with code.” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said there would be an investigation into updating code “given serious change in climate that we are seeing across the country” that appears to factor into stronger tornadoes.Not far from Mayfield, 67 people spent Sunday night at a church serving as a shelter in Wingo, and 40 more were expected to arrive Monday. Organizers were working to find a mobile outdoor shower facility and a laundry truck, expecting many of the displaced to need a long-term place to stay. Volunteers were scrambling to meet more immediate needs, too, such as underwear and socks.Lifelong Mayfield resident Cynthia Gargis, 51, is staying with her daughter after the storm tore off the front of her apartment and sucked out almost everything inside. She came to the shelter to offer help and visit with friends who lost their homes.“I don’t know, I don’t see how we’ll ever get over this,” she said. “It won’t ever be the same.”Glynda Glover, 82, said she had no idea how long she would stay at the Wingo shelter: Her apartment is uninhabitable since the wind blew out the windows and covered her bed in glass and asphalt.“I’ll stay here until we get back to whatever normal is,” she said, “and I don’t know what normal is anymore.”On the outskirts of Dawson Springs, another town devastated by the storms, homes were reduced to rubble and trees toppled, littering the landscape for a span of at least a mile.“It looks like a bomb went off. It’s just completely destroyed in areas,” said Jack Whitfield Jr., the Hopkins County judge-executive.He estimated that more than 60% of the town, including hundreds of homes, was “beyond repair."“A full recovering is going to take years,” he said.Tim Morgan, a volunteer chaplain for the Hopkins County Sheriff’s Department, said he’s seen the aftermath of tornadoes and hurricanes before, but nothing like this.“Just absolute decimation. There is an entire hillside of houses that are 3 feet tall now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-without-water-heat-after-tornadoes-kill-more-than-88-in-us-kentucky-101639433024432.html
14-12-2021||World||US president Biden to tour tornado damaged Kentucky on Wednesday||President Joe Biden said Monday that he will travel to Kentucky on Wednesday to view damage from last week's devastating tornadoes that killed at dozens of people and displaced thousands more.Biden announced the upcoming trip following a briefing with homeland security and disaster response officials in the Oval Office to discuss what more the federal government can do to support those affected by the natural disaster. The White House said he would visit Fort Campbell, Kentucky, for a briefing on the response operations, and then to hard-hit Mayfield and Dawson Springs to survey the damage.Biden said he was developing the itinerary in consultation with local officials to ensure that his presence doesn't distract from the ongoing emergency response.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday that Biden is not expected to give a speech when he visits Kentucky, but will rather be focused on meeting with local officials and “trying to be a source of comfort to people who have gone through a devastating couple of days in their communities.”“That visit is really about him receiving an update of the work that’s happening on the ground, hearing directly from leaders on what they need more from the federal government, if anything, and he’s going to be very responsive to that,” she said.Biden, who has already signed emergency declarations for Kentucky, said he stands ready to do the same for Illinois. He added that he has ordered his administration to make every resource available to local and state officials in Kentucky and the other states impacted by the storms.The president said his message to governors was that the federal government would help them get “Whatever they need, when they need it.”“We’re going to get this done,” Biden added. “We’re going to be there as long as it takes to help.”Speaking on the Senate floor, Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who hails from Kentucky, said, “This is the worst storm to hit Kentucky in my lifetime." McConnell said he'll travel “at the end of the week” back to Kentucky — an indication he would not be joining Biden’s trip Wednesday.McConnell earlier Monday thanked Biden in a tweet for his actions to help the state.“Thank you @POTUS for your rapid approval of Kentucky’s Major Disaster Declaration,” he said. “Our entire congressional delegation came together to support @GovAndyBeshear’s request. I appreciate the Administration’s quick work to speed resources to help deal with this crisis.”Biden said he was worried, beyond the lives lost, about the emotional toll the disaster is putting on all those impacted.“I worry quite frankly about the mental health of these people,” he said. He said his administration was working to help people gain “peace of mind” so that they can “actually put their head on a pillow, lie down and be able to know their kids are going to be okay.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-biden-to-tour-tornado-damaged-kentucky-on-wednesday-101639432816952.html
14-12-2021||World||US troops to go unpunished over deadly August Kabul drone strike||The Pentagon said Monday that no US troops or officials would face disciplinary action for a drone strike in Kabul in August that killed 10 Afghan civilians, including seven children.Spokesman John Kirby said Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had received a high-level review of the strike which made no recommendation of accountability."He approved their recommendations," Kirby said. "The secretary is not... calling for additional accountability measures."The August 29 drone strike took place in the final days of the US-led evacuation of Kabul after the Taliban seized control of the country.US officials said they had intelligence of a possible Islamic State attack on the evacuation operations at Kabul airport, and launched a missile from a drone at a target that, in reality, was a family that included an Afghan man who worked for a US aid group.In early November an initial report carried out by the US Air Force inspector general, Lieutenant General Sami Said, called the strike tragic but "an honest mistake."The review by Central Command head General Kenneth McKenzie Jr. and Special Operations Command chief General Richard Clarke made use of Said's report and detailed recommendations on procedures for future drone strikes.But it made no call for anyone to be punished for the mistake."What we saw here was a breakdown in process, in execution and procedural events, not the result of negligence, not the result of misconduct, not the result of poor leadership," said Kirby.If Austin "believed . . . that accountability was warranted, he would certainly support those kinds of efforts," Kirby added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-troops-to-go-unpunished-over-deadly-august-kabul-drone-strike-101639432468438.html
14-12-2021||World||Spyware firm NSO planning to shutdown Pegasus, sell company||NSO Group Ltd., the scandal-plagued spyware company that’s in danger of defaulting on its debts, is exploring options that include shutting its controversial Pegasus unit and selling the entire company, according to people familiar with the matter.Talks have been held with several investment funds about moves that include a refinancing or outright sale, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. The company has brought in advisers from Moelis & Co. to assist, and lenders are getting advice from lawyers at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, the people said.The prospective new owners include two American funds that have discussed taking control and closing Pegasus, one of the people said. Under that scenario, the funds would then inject about $200 million in fresh capital to turn the know-how behind Pegasus into strictly defensive cyber security services, and perhaps develop the Israeli company’s drone technology, one of the people said.A spokeswoman for Herzliya-based NSO declined to comment. A representative for New York-based Moelis said the company declined to comment. A representative for Willkie Farr didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Elements of the potential transaction were reported earlier by Debtwire.Pegasus software can track a user’s mobile phone, and its misuse has landed NSO at the center of high-profile privacy and human rights abuse cases. The product allegedly was supplied to governments that used it to spy on political dissidents, journalists and human right activists. Pegasus was also reported to have been used in recent months to hack the mobile phones of at least nine State Department employees. The company has said it sells the technology to law enforcement and government agencies to prevent crime and terrorism, and that it has ended contracts with clients that abused it. The US Commerce Department nevertheless blacklisted NSO, which said in November it was seeking to reverse the decision, “given that our technologies support US national security interests and policies.” Apple Inc. has sued NSO, seeking to bar the spyware firm from using its products and services, and said it would start notifying users targeted by state-sponsored hacking.The US restrictions put added pressure on NSO, which needs to pay back about $450 million in debt, just two years after a management buyout that valued the company at about $1 billion. Moody’s Investors Service said last month there’s an increasing risk the company will violate the terms of its loans.A loan with a face value of over $300 million that NSO issued in 2019 was trading in November at an all-time low bid of 70 cents on the dollar. It was quoted Monday at a bid of 50 cents on the dollar, according to people familiar with the prices. A shutdown of Pegasus could leave NSO as a much smaller and potentially less valuable company, because the unit accounts for about half of NSO’s revenue. The company expects to record about $230 million in sales this year, one of the people said, 8% less than in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spyware-firm-nso-planning-to-shutdown-pegasus-sell-company-101639432229284.html
14-12-2021||World||George Floyd death: Chauvin expected to plead guilty||Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of the murder of George Floyd, plans to change his not guilty plea to separate civil rights charges, according to a court filing on Monday.Chauvin, 45, appears likely to change his plea from not guilty to guilty to the federal charges of violating the civil rights of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man.A change of plea hearing is scheduled for Wednesday in US District Court in St Paul, Minnesota.Chauvin was sentenced in June to 22 and a half years in prison for Floyd's May 2020 death, which sparked protests against racial injustice and police brutality across the United States.Chauvin and three other police officers who were on the scene during Floyd's fatal arrest -- Tou Thao, Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane -- were charged with violating his constitutional rights and failing to respond to his medical needs.All four pleaded not guilty to the federal charges. They are scheduled to go on trial next year.Chauvin, who is white, was captured on video kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly 10 minutes, until he fell unconscious and died.Keung and Lane helped to restrain the handcuffed Floyd, while Thao kept away bystanders who were pleading with the officers to get off of Floyd as he complained he was unable to breathe.A jury took less than 10 hours to convict Chauvin in April at the end of a high-profile trial. The verdict was greeted with relief by many Americans amid fears an acquittal could trigger further unrest.cl/sw||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-death-chauvin-expected-to-plead-guilty-101639432036441.html

It would be the United States, China and Republic of Korea and North Korea. And I believe, in principle, everybody agrees to the declaration,” Moon said during a press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison after bilateral talks in Canberra.Moon also said that the declaration should establish a peace regime in the Korean Peninsula and put an end to the “quite unstable” armistice, stressing that it was important to initiate talks between North and South Korea and between the US and North Korea.The Korean War de facto ended in 1953 after the US and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea ratified an armistice without signing a peace treaty.Morrison and Moon also agreed to upgrade the formal ties between their nations to a “comprehensive strategic partnership”.The two countries signed a 1bn Australian dollars ($720mn) defence deal as Moon became the first foreign leader to visit Australia since the pandemic began.The deal will see South Korean defence company Hanwha provide the Australian army with artillery weapons, supply vehicles and radars.It’s the largest defence contract struck between Australia and an Asian nation, and comes at a time of heightened tensions between Australia and China.Moon rules out joining Beijing Olympic boycottSouth Korea’s president on Monday ruled out joining a US diplomatic boycott of February’s Beijing Winter Olympics, citing the need to work with China.Moon said he was “not considering” snubbing the Olympics to protest China’s human rights abuses, as several Western nations have done. “We have not received a request from any other country including the United States to participate in the diplomatic boycott,” he said.China has warned the US, Australia, Britain and Canada that they will “pay the price”.The boycott was prompted by China’s abuses against the Uighur minority in Xinjiang and its smothering of democracy in Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/end-of-korean-war-agreed-to-in-principle-moon-101639420435917.html
14-12-2021||World||UK confirms 1st Omicron death; first case in China||Britain on Monday confirmed what is thought to be the first confirmed death after infection with the Omicron variant, as the country launched an ambitious Covid booster shot programme to stop the virus spiralling out of control. Meanwhile, the first case of the Omicron variant infection in China was detected in the northern city of Tianjin on Monday night, health authorities said.The infection was discovered in a traveller who arrived in the city from overseas on December 9, Chinese official media reported, adding that the patient is currently being treated in isolation in a city hospital.Separately, a sub-strain of the Covid-19 Delta variant has triggered a new cluster of cases in eastern China’s industrial powerhouse province of Zhejiang, causing many of the 190 cases in a week, locking down more than 500,000 residents and shutting down factories.Several infections diagnosed until Monday afternoon were of the Delta strain sub-lineage AY.4, prompting large-scale travel restrictions in the province, mass nucleic acid tests with more than 52,000 people sent to centralised isolation.Rush to get booster shots in the United KingdomLong lines formed at vaccination centres in Britain as people heeded the government’s call for all adults to get booster shots to protect against the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.On a visit to a vaccination centre in west London, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Omicron accounted for about 40% of the cases in the British capital, and hospital admissions were rising.“Sadly, at least one patient has been confirmed to have died with Omicron,” he told reporters, a day after warning that the country faces a “tidal wave” of infection.Scientists in South Africa, where Omicron was first identified, say they see signs the variant may cause less severe disease than Delta but cautioned it was too soon to be certain.Health authorities around the world are watching Britain closely to see what an Omicron surge looks like in a country with an older, more highly vaccinated population than South Africa’s.The British government raised the country’s official coronavirus threat level on Sunday, warning the rapid spread of Omicron “adds additional and rapidly increasing risk to the public and health care services” at a time when Covid is already widespread.Denmark pushes third vaccine dose, Norway to tighten restrictionsDanish health authorities said on Monday a third dose of the vaccine would be offered sooner to everyone over 40 to curb the spread of the Omicron variant.Norway will further tighten restrictions in a bid to limit an expected surge of the Omicron variant, Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere told news agency NTB on Monday.Omicron poses ‘very high’ risk but data on severity limitedThe World Health Organization (WHO) on Sunday said the Omicron variant, reported in more than 60 countries, poses a “very high” global risk, with some evidence that it evades vaccine protection but clinical data on its severity is limited.Considerable uncertainties surround Omicron, first detected last month in southern Africa and Hong Kong, whose mutations may lead to higher transmissibility and more cases of Covid-19 disease, the WHO said. “The overall risk related to the new variant of concern Omicron remains very high for a number of reasons,” it said, reiterating its first assessment made on November 29.Meanwhile South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has postponed getting a booster shot of a Covid-19 vaccine because he has tested positive for the disease and is recuperating from mild symptoms, his office announced on Monday.With inputs from Sutirtho Patranobis||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-confirms-1st-omicron-death-first-case-in-china-101639420205021.html
