A booster lifted protection to 70% to 75% in the early days after the shot.“These early estimates should be treated with caution, but they indicate that a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the omicron variant,” Mary Ramsay, head of immunization at the U.K. Health Security Agency, said in a statement.The findings come as the U.K. accelerates its booster campaign in the face of the heavily mutated variant. New evidence shows the strain is growing much faster than delta, and U.K. health officials expect omicron to become the dominant variant by the middle of December, accounting for more than half of new cases.Effectiveness against severe disease is still unknown but expected to be higher than against symptomatic illness alone, the government said Friday. The U.K. has relied largely on the Pfizer vaccine for boosters, complemented by Moderna Inc.’s shot when needed. Many people in Britain got the AstraZeneca vaccine for their first two doses.Preliminary StudyThe analysis looked at 581 people with confirmed omicron, and health authorities said the figures should be interpreted with caution until more cases have been studied. The U.K. has moved to reimpose some measures, including indoor mask-wearing and work-from-home guidance as omicron proliferates. The new strain may be spreading faster in England than in South Africa and U.K. cases of the variant could top 60,000 a day by Christmas, according to epidemiologist John Edmunds.Other early indications of vaccine effectiveness against omicron have given a mixed picture, with Pfizer and BioNTech saying initial lab studies show a third dose may be needed to neutralize it. Researchers in South Africa have also found a drop-off in the level of antibody protection from that vaccine versus the new strain, though so-called T-cells may still offer an immune defense against severe disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/omicron-variant-boosters-could-provide-70-to-75-protection-shows-uk-study-101639159113888.html

The ceasefire had come into effect on November 9, the report added.In the message, Mufti Noor can be heard as saying that since the TTP has not heard back from the mediators or the government, therefore, past midnight, his fighters reserve the right to resume attacks wherever they were.The TTP decision to end the ceasefire is a big setback to the government's efforts to secure a peace agreement with the militants waging war against the state for decades.A lot of informal discussions had taken place between the two sides before and during the ceasefire and certain confidence-building steps had been agreed upon to reassure each other, the sources were quoted as saying by the Dawn.Afghan Taliban are playing the role of principal mediator between Pakistan and the outlawed militant conglomerate comprising several factions.Under the deal, the government has agreed to release close to one hundred militants being held at ‘de-radicalisation centers’. The first batch of around 12 has already been released. The second batch is expected to be freed in the next few days, to be followed by more in the days and weeks to come, the report said.Quoting sources, the Dawn reported that during the informal talks, it has been made clear to the TTP that there are certain redlines which are not open to negotiations.The TTP, however, has set its own conditions which among other things include enforcement of Shariah and restoration of tribal areas to their pre-merger status.The ceasefire has remained enforced with no major violations. TTP-led militant attacks inside Pakistan which had seen a dramatic spike in the immediate aftermath of the Afghan Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in mid-August have seen a steady decline, the report said.These attacks saw a further decrease of 28 per cent since October, when the ceasefire came into effect, according to official statistics of the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.TTP was also behind a 2014 attack on an army-run school in the northwestern city of Peshawar that killed 154 people, mostly school children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-taliban-declares-end-to-ceasefire-with-pak-govt-to-resume-attacks-101639156826026.html

We have to renew it with each generation. And this is an urgent matter on all our parts, in my view,” he said.US President Joe Biden is expected to focus on election integrity, independent media and countering authoritarian regimes around the world in his remarks wrapping up the two-day Summit for Democracy attended virtually by most world leaders, journalists and activists.In his opening remarks on Thursday, the US president warned against taking democracy for granted. “Democracy doesn’t happen by accident. We have to renew it with each generation. And this is an urgent matter on all our parts, in my view,” he said.|#+|Democracy is under threat, he added, from autocrats around the world who seek to perpetuate their hold on power by touting their policies and practices as the “more efficient way to address today’s challenges”. They “fan the flames of societal division and political polarization”.And most importantly and worryingly, Biden went on to say, was their effort to increase “the dissatisfaction of people all around the world with democratic governments that they feel are failing to deliver for their needs”.This “is the defining challenge of our time”, he said.The two-day summit has been attended president and prime ministers from around the world. The notable exceptions were Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, China’s President Xi Jinping, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Hungry’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban. More than 100 government’s were invited, which did not include Russia and China, of which 89 accepted.Pakistan was among those who turned down Biden’s invitation saying it will engage with the US “at an opportune time in the future”. Biden has not spoken to Prime Minister Imran Khan since taking office, even as his officials have engaged with their counterparts in Islamabad several times.“Democracies are not all the same,” Biden said in opening remarks. “We don’t agree on everything—all of us in this meeting today. But the choices we make together are going to define, in my view, the course of our shared future for generations to come.”Biden said the US will lead by example — “investing in ...our democracy” and supporting , “partners around the world at the same time”.The most serious threat to democracy in the US came on January 6, when hordes of supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol to prevent a joint sitting of the two chambers of congress from certifying Biden’ election victory in November.“Our domestic agenda has been focused on delivering for the needs of the American people and strengthening our democratic institutions at home,” he said and went on to list them out, including efforts to make it easier for Americans to register to vote and then cast their votes.Outside of the US, he announced the launch of a fund of $424 million “to shore up transparent and accountable governance, including supporting media freedom, fighting international corruption, standing with democratic reformers, promoting technology that advances democracy, and defining and defending what a fair election is” around the world.The summit kicks off a “year of action” with follow-up measures. “It essentially gives us more time to develop some of these initiatives, to develop commitments, to work together with all sorts of governments around the world to reinforce the themes of democratic renewal,” a senior Biden administration official told reporters earlier this week while previewing the summit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-focus-on-elections-media-as-democracy-summit-wraps-up-101639157003691.html

10-12-2021||World||Geminid meteor shower: Best timing, place, ways to watch||The Geminid meteor shower, one of the favourite meteor showers of skywatchers, is currently active and is expected to peak on the intervening night of December 13-14, making those hours the best time for viewing, according to Nasa.The Geminid meteors are caused by debris from a celestial object 3200 Phaethon whose origin is up for debate among astronomers. While some consider it an extinct comet, others argue that the object has to be an asteroid given its similarity to the main-belt asteroid Pallas. The proponents of 3200 Phaethon as an extinct comet have based their argument on the observations showing some small amount of material leaving the object’s surface.According to Nasa, the Geminids are denser than meteors belonging to other showers, like the Perseids. The density of the Geminids enables them to get as close as 29 miles above Earth’s surface before burning up.Best place to watchSkywatchers around the world can see the Geminids meteor shower but the observers in the Northern Hemisphere get the best view. For the observers, the altitude of the Gemini radiant gets lower above the horizon as they enter the Southern Hemisphere and move towards the South Pole. People in these locations see fewer Geminids than their northern counterparts, Nasa said.Weather and the lunar phase are also major factors in determining the visibility of meteor showers during any time of the year. Moonlight overshadows the fainter meteors, making it difficult for skywatchers to see less bright ones. This year’s Geminids meteor shower won’t be ideal to observe during its peak since the Moon will be almost 80% full.“Nevertheless, that bright Moon is expected to set around 2:00 a.m. wherever you are located, leaving a couple of hours for meteor watching until twilight,” Nasa said in a blog post.How to watchWeather permitting, skywatchers should get away from bright lights to let their eyes adjust to the dark. They should lie on their back and observe the sky closely. They should also not look at their cell phone screen.Nasa will broadcast a live stream of the Geminids meteor shower’s peak on December 13-14 through a meteor camera at the space agency's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The live streaming will start at 8pm CST on the NASA Meteor Watch Facebook page.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/geminid-meteor-shower-best-timing-place-ways-to-watch-101639155456581.html

The conservative-majority court on Sept. 1 had declined to halt the law. The court in a separate case dismissed a separate challenge brought by President Joe Biden's administration.The Supreme Court has yet to decide another major abortion rights case from Mississippi that could lead to the overturning of the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized the procedure nationwide.The court in the Texas case ruled 8-1 that the challenge was allowed under a 1908 Supreme Court ruling that said state laws can be challenged in federal court by suing state government officials. Texas had sought to exploit a loophole in that earlier ruling by saying no state officials could enforce it, but the Supreme Court said the challengers could pursue their case by naming state licensing officials as defendants.Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas dissented on that part of the ruling, saying he would have dismissed the lawsuit altogether.The Texas law enables private citizens to sue anyone who performs or assists a woman in getting an abortion after cardiac activity is detected in the embryo. That feature made it more difficult to directly sue the state. Individual citizens can be awarded a minimum of $10,000 for bringing successful lawsuits under the law. Biden's administration has called it a "bounty."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-leaves-texas-six-week-abortion-ban-in-force-allows-challenge-101639149925851.html

Biden will make his late-night television debut as the president of the United States on ‘The Tonight Show’ on Friday, host Jimmy Fallon announced during his show the previous night."Guys we have a big announcement for tomorrow night's show. The 46th president of the United States joins me for his first late-night appearance since taking office," Fallon said.The White House has not revealed where the US president will be when he tapes the segment. This is not the first time Biden will be appearing on Fallon’s ‘The Tonight Show’. In April 2020, just a week before Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee for the presidential race, he appeared on the show where he bantered with Fallon. He also gave an appearance in September 2016 when he was deputy to US President Barack Obama.The announcement comes amid a steep drop in Biden’s approval rating, and the Democrat has been under tremendous pressure to engage more with the media. Biden’s approval rating has suffered as the majority of Americans disapprove of the way he has handled the economy, according to a recent poll jointly conducted by Washington Post and ABC News. About 53% of the respondents disapproved of the way Biden has handled his job as the US president.“Overall, the survey offers a set of harsh judgments about the president’s performance and the state of the economy. Together, they send a stark warning to Democrats about their prospects in the 2022 midterm contests,” The Washington Post had said in its report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-make-late-night-tv-debut-as-us-president-on-jimmy-fallon-s-the-tonight-show-101639141880861.html

Macron said the boycott was "a symbolic step" and will not have a useful outcome.A number of countries including Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada have announced a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics in China over concerns of human rights violations in the country.The boycott also came in the backdrop of the sudden disappearance of Chinese tennis player Peng Shua, who is untraceable since she made sexual assault allegations against a former vice premier, three weeks ago."I didn't hear anybody in the world say: let's not send our athletes. So we're talking about something rather symbolic," Macron said during a news conference on Thursday, as per local media reports.Instead, the French president said France would work with the International Olympic Committee on a charter guaranteeing the protection of athletes "given what has happened over recent weeks”. "I don't think we should politicise these topics, especially if it's to take steps that are insignificant and symbolic," he added."To be clear: You either have a complete boycott, and not send athletes, or you try to change things with useful actions," Macron also said.In the backdrop of multiple reports claiming human rights violations in China under the rule of the Chinese Communist Party (CPP), the US, the UK, Canada and Australia have said they will not send government representatives to the Beijing Games, slated to be held in February.This includes allegations of abuse against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang regions, where according to reports, China has detained over a million people of minorities, in a large network of what the state calls "re-education camps." Since 2016, several reports have come into the light detailing the brutal policies of China including "forced birth control and sterilisation" of Uyghur ethnic groups.Earlier in the day, an independent UK tribunal also said that the country is committing genocide against predominantly Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang.However, China denies any wrongdoing, saying allegations of human rights abuses are "fabricated" and "motivated."Reacting to the boycott call, China on Thursday said the countries "will pay the price for their mistaken acts"."The US, Australia, Britain and Canada's use of the Olympic platform for political manipulation is unpopular and self-isolating, and they will inevitably pay the price for their wrongdoing," foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/insignificant-and-symbolic-french-president-macron-on-boycott-of-beijing-game-101639122569063.html

10-12-2021||World||Al-Qaeda numbers in Afghanistan up 'slightly' since Taliban takeover: US||The al-Qaeda extremist group has grown slightly inside Afghanistan since US forces left in late August, and the country's new Taliban leaders are divided over whether to fulfill their 2020 pledge to break ties with the group, the top US commander in the region said Thursday.Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of US Central Command, said in an interview with The Associated Press that the departure of US military and intelligence assets from Afghanistan has made it much harder to track al-Qaeda and other extremist groups inside Afghanistan.“We're probably at about 1 or 2% of the capabilities we once had to look into Afghanistan,” he said, adding that this makes it “very hard, not impossible” to ensure that neither al-Qaeda nor the Islamic State group's Afghanistan affiliate can pose a threat to the United States.Speaking at the Pentagon, McKenzie said it's clear that al-Qaeda is attempting to rebuild its presence inside Afghanistan, which was the base from which it planned the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks against the United States. He said some militants are coming into the country through its porous borders, but it is hard for the US to track numbers.The US invasion that followed the Sept. 11 attacks led to a 20-year war that succeeded initially by removing the Taliban from power but ultimately failed. After President Joe Biden announced in April that he was withdrawing completely from Afghanistan, the Taliban systematically overpowered Afghan government defenses and seized Kabul, the capital, in August.McKenzie and other senior US military and national security officials had said before the US withdrawal that it would complicate efforts to keep a lid on the al-Qaeda threat, in part because of the loss of on-the-ground intelligence information and the absence of a US-friendly government in Kabul. The US says it will rely on airstrikes from drones and other aircraft based beyond Afghanistan's borders to respond to any extremist threats against the US homeland.McKenzie said no such strikes have been conducted since the US completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan on Aug. 30. He added that America's ability to conduct such strikes is based on the availability of intelligence, overhead imagery and other information and communications, “and that architecture is still being developed right now.”Al-Qaeda is among numerous extremist groups inside Afghanistan. After 2001, it lost most of its numbers and its ability to directly threaten US territory, but McKenzie said it retains “an aspirational desire” to attack the United States. During their first period of rule in Kabul, from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban gave haven to al-Qaeda and refused Washington's demand after 9/11 to expel the group and turn over its leader, Osama bin Laden. The Taliban and al-Qaeda have maintained ties ever since.“So we're still trying to sort out exactly how the Taliban is going to proceed against them, and I think over the month or two it'll become a little more apparent to us,” he said.Similarly, McKenzie said it's not yet clear how strongly Taliban will go after the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, which has violently attacked the Taliban across the country. The United States blamed ISIS for an Aug. 26 suicide bombing at Kabul airport that killed 13 American service members in the final days of the US evacuation.ISIS was “reinvigorated," McKenzie said, by the release of numerous ISIS fighters from Afghan prisons in mid-August. He said both ISIS and al-Qaeda are recruiting from inside and outside Afghanistan.“So certainly we should expect a resurgent ISIS. It would be very surprising if that weren't the case,” he said, adding, “It remains to be seen that the Taliban are going to be able to take effective action against them.”He called al-Qaeda a more difficult problem for the Taliban because of their longstanding ties.“So I think there are internal arguments inside the Taliban about the way forward,” he said. “What we would like to see from the Taliban would be a strong position against al-Qaeda,” which they promised as part of the February 2020 Doha agreement that committed the United States to fully withdrawing from Afghanistan. “But I don't believe that's yet been fully realised.”McKenzie declined to provide an estimate of the number of al-Qaeda operatives inside Afghanistan.“I think it's probably slightly increased,” he said. “There's a presence. We thought it was down pretty small, you know, toward the end of the conflict. I think some people have probably come back in. But it's one of the things we look at, but I wouldn't be confident giving you a number right now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-commander-al-qaeda-numbers-in-afghanistan-up-slightly-101639114155519.html
10-12-2021||World||US study validates Narendra Modi’s green energy goal||India would be able to cut electricity costs, meet its doubling power demand and reduce emissions if it meets its target of installing 500 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030, and without having to shut down polluting coal- and gas-based power plants, says a new US study released on Thursday.But there are conditions to this optimistic projection. The costs of battery storage and wind and solar energy technologies should continue to fall as they have over the past decade and should be accompanied by complementary flexible resources, such as efficient energy storage, agricultural load shifting, and hydropower, and optimally utilising the existing thermal power assets in the country.The study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LNBL), which is a US department of energy’s office of science lab managed by University of California, projects that if India achieves the target of installing 500 GW of renewable electricity capacity by 2030, it could reduce electricity costs by 8-10%, provided the renewable energy and battery storage prices continue to decline. And it will be able to reduce the carbon emissions intensity of its electricity supply by 43-50% by 2030 over the 2020 level. Emissions Intensity is the unit of Green House Gas emission relative to the GDP, a measure preferred by India for fixing its mitigation targets under the 2015 Paris Agreement called Nationally Determined Contributions. Other countries - specially developed countries - have committed themselves to reducing just emissions, irrespective of the size of their economy.The study validates the cost-effectiveness of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement at the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow recently that India would have installed 500 GW of renewable energy production capacity by 2030.“We found that building such high levels of renewable energy would actually be economical for India, thanks to the cost reductions in clean technologies that have occurred much faster than anticipated,” said Berkeley Lab scientist and the study’s lead author Nikit Abhyankar, an Indian-American. “However, the key to achieving the lowest costs, while maintaining grid reliability, lies in complementing the renewable energy buildout with flexible resources such as energy storage and demand response, and utilising the existing thermal power assets in the country in the most efficient manner.”The study’s two others researchers are also Indian-Americans, Shruti Deorah and Amol Phadke. It was funded by the US department of state, Bureau of Energy Resources, under the Flexible Resources Initiative of the US-India Clean Energy Finance Task Force.India has committed itself to installing 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022, up from the current 100 GW, and eventually to 500 GW by 2030.The study demonstrates that if India hits the 2030 target, 50% of its electricity supply could come from carbon-free sources compared to only 25% in 2020.This would require, though, quadrupling total renewable energy capacity, the study said. But that would still be cheaper than building coal- and gas-based plants if the transition was supplemented by, the researchers found, flexible resources such as shifting agricultural electricity consumption to solar hours, using batteries to store four to six hours of daily energy for nighttime use, and utilising flexibility in existing thermal power plants is cheaper than building new coal- or gas-based plants.This does not have to come at the expense of traditional coal- and gas-based energy plants. India does not have to shut them down immediately, a prospect that confronts many developed countries such as the United States, accompanied by the closure of mines and job losses. This would give India time to plan its long-term transition from these polluting energy sources.But, as stated earlier, there are certain conditions for this least-cost optimism. Worldwide price in battery storage and wind and solar technologies should continue to fall. And for its own part, India will require to make certain regulatory changes, in an enabling policy and regulatory framework.This framework, the study says, should include enabling states to share resources with each other, integrating reliability and cost-effectiveness in electric utilities’ planning and procurement practices, widening and deepening the electricity markets, ensuring that energy storage is appropriately valued and compensated for, and coordinating between power and gas sector operations for efficient utilisation of the existing gas pipelines and gas power generation assets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-study-validates-narendra-modi-s-green-energy-goal-101639116248897.html

These facts are grounded in history and law, and represent a universally agreed norm governing international relations.”“This is the right choice that is in line with the global trend and has people’s support. China highly appreciates this decision,” the statement said.China says Taiwan is a breakaway province, with no right to the trappings of a state, and has not ruled out using force to reunify it.The Reuters report said China has stepped up pressure to win away Taiwan’s remaining allies, especially in Central America and the Caribbean, with El Salvador and the Dominican Republic going over to Beijing in 2018, and Panama the year before.China’s ambassador at the United Nations, Zhang Jun, congratulated Nicaragua, saying Beijing commends the decision. “The One-China principle is a consensus widely accepted by the international community and allows no challenge,” Zhang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-loses-ally-nicaragua-to-china-101639114988182.html

10-12-2021||World||US court rejects Donald Trump's bid to keep Jan 6 Capitol riot documents secret||A US federal appeals court on Thursday rejected former president Donald Trump's bid to prevent the release of White House records relating to the January 6 attack on the Capitol.The appeals court agreed with a lower court ruling that President Joe Biden could waive executive privilege on the records, so that they could be handed over to a Congressional panel investigating the violence by Trump supporters.Trump, who has been accused of fomenting the attack on the US Congress, sought to exercise his privilege as a former president to keep the documents and phone records that might relate to the attack a secret.But the court said Biden's judgment carried more weight in the case."The right of a former president certainly enjoys no greater weight than that of the incumbent," the appeals court said in its ruling."In this case, President Biden, as the head of the Executive Branch, has specifically found that Congress has demonstrated a compelling need for these very documents and that disclosure is in the best interests of the nation," the court said.Supreme Court appeal expectedThe ruling did not trigger the immediate release of the records. The appeals court said that Trump's lawyers would have two weeks to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.There, Trump's attorneys are expected to request a new freeze on the release while the high court reviews the unprecedented case."Regardless of today's decision by the appeals court, this case was always destined for the Supreme Court," said Trump spokeswoman Liz Harrington."President Trump's duty to defend the Constitution and the Office of the Presidency continues, and he will keep fighting for every American and every future administration."The appeals court said the public interest was greater than Trump's own in relation to the records, which are held by the National Archives."That public interest is heightened when, as here, the legislature is proceeding with urgency to prevent violent attacks on the federal government and disruptions to the peaceful transfer of power," it said.The records are sought by the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 violence, in which hundreds of Trump supporters forced the shutdown of Congress and delayed a joint session to confirm that Joe Biden had won the November 2020 election over Trump and would become president."We applaud the Court's decisive ruling, which respects the Select Committee's interest in obtaining White House records and the President's judgment in allowing those records to be produced," the special committee's Democratic chairman Representative Bennie Thompson and Republican vice chair Liz Cheney said in a joint statement Thursday.Documents that Trump hoped to block include records from his top aides and memos to his former press secretary.The more than 770 pages include records of his former chief of staff Mark Meadows, his former senior advisor Stephen Miller and his former deputy counsel Patrick Philbin.Trump had also hoped to block the release of the White House Daily Diary -- a record of his activities, trips, briefings and phone calls.Another trove of documents Trump does not want Congress to see includes memos to his former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, a handwritten note on the January 6 events and a draft text of his speech at the "Save America" rally, which preceded the attack."Today, the Courts have once again rejected the former President's campaign to obstruct Congress's investigation into the January 6th insurrection," Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said in a statement after the ruling."No one can be allowed to stand in the way of the truth - particularly not the previous President, who incited the insurrection."Investigation advancesThe January 6 committee meanwhile continued to push ahead in its investigation.Witness and document requests indicate it is seeking to determine whether the White House played a role in encouraging or even plotting the January 6 attack as part of Trump's effort to prevent Biden from taking office.Cheney, the committee's vice-chair, said it had now heard from nearly 300 witnesses, including four on Thursday: former Trump aide and Pentagon official Kash Patel; Ali Alexander, who helped organize the pro-Trump rally at the White House before the Capitol attack; and two others.When Trump political consultant Steve Bannon refused to testify on his role on January 6, he was held in contempt, and then arrested by the Justice Department.Next week, the committee is expected to also rule Meadows in contempt for refusing to testify."The investigation is firing on all cylinders," Cheney said on Twitter."President Trump is trying to hide what happened on January 6th and to delay and obstruct. We will not let that happen."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-court-rejects-donald-trump-s-bid-to-keep-jan-6-capitol-riot-documents-secret-101639107263574.html
10-12-2021||World||Singapore: Omicron variant of Covid-19 detected in 2 people with booster shots||Two Singapore residents may have caught the omicron variant even after receiving Covid-19 booster shots, in cases that may shed light on the protection offered by the third dose of vaccine. A 24-year-old female airport passenger service worker has returned a preliminary positive test to omicron, in what would be the city-state’s first local case of the variant, the health ministry said in a statement late Thursday. The second person is considered an imported case after returning from Germany via the vaccinated travel lane on Dec. 6. Both had received the third dose of vaccines, the ministry said. Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE earlier this week said initial lab studies show a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine may be needed to neutralise the omicron variant. Company researchers observed a 25-fold reduction in neutralizing antibodies that fight the variant, compared with the original strain of the virus, in people who got just two shots. However, boosting with an additional shot of the vaccine restored protection to a level similar to the initial two-dose regimen. “Given its high transmissibility and spread to many parts of the world, we should expect to find more omicron cases at our borders and also within our community,” Singapore’s health ministry said.Both people are recovering in isolation at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, and all close contacts will be placed in 10-day quarantine at designated facilities, the ministry said.The airport worker had been tested as part of weekly testing for frontline border workers. She was asymptomatic when detected through the testing, according to the statement. In the second case, the 46-year-old had tested negative with a polymerase chain reaction test on arrival. However, she developed a runny nose the next day and sought medical treatment the day after that, when she tested positive.   Singapore has seen a sharp drop in community cases over the past month, along with a significant easing in hospital loads. the city-state has one of the world’s best vaccination rates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 87% of the total population is fully vaccinated, while 96% of those eligible are fully inoculated, most with Pfizer or Moderna. Some 29% have also received booster jabs. Government officials have said jabs for those aged 5-11 will be offered soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-omicron-variant-of-covid-19-detected-in-2-people-with-booster-shots-101639104397845.html

10-12-2021||World||China guilty of Xinjiang genocide: Independent UK panel||China is committing genocide against predominantly Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang, an independent UK tribunal said, adding to the criticism Beijing faces over its activities in the western region. “The tribunal is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the PRC, by the imposition of measures to prevent births intended to destroy a significant part of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang as such, has committed genocide,” Geoffrey Nice, chair of the London-based panel of lawyers, academics and former diplomats, said on Thursday, using an acronym for the People’s Republic of China.  The tribunal has no government backing, meaning its conclusions are non-binding, but its decision is certain to elicit an angry response from China. The country’s Foreign Ministry has dismissed the panel as a “machine churning out lies” and Beijing sanctioned it in March. “Despite its name, this is a propaganda organization that has nothing to do with the law,” Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Communist Party-backed Global Times newspaper, wrote on Twitter on Thursday after the decision. “The so-called ruling is purely a public stunt to coordinate with anti-China propaganda.”An important finding of the tribunal was that genocide couldn’t have taken place “without the knowledge and tacit support of President Xi Jinping and other senior leaders of the Chinese Communist Party,” said Sam Brownback, former ambassador-at-large for the US International Religious Freedom commission. “Even if those individuals did not give direct orders, they created an environment in which these crimes against humanity could take place without repercussion against those committing them,” he added.The US House approved a volley of measures this week targeting China over allegations of human rights abuses, including the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, a resolution stating the International Olympic Committee “failed to adhere to its own human rights commitments” to tennis star Peng Shuai and a resolution calling for a United Nations investigation into genocide in Xinjiang.With the Beijing Winter Olympics now some 57 days away, the US, UK Australia and Canada have announced diplomatic boycotts of games also over human rights concerns. That followed the Women’s Tennis Association’s decision to suspend activities in China over the treatment of Peng, who last month alleged an affair with a top Communist Party official.Since launching in September 2020, the tribunal has heard from academics, former politicians and victims of alleged abuses. Its chair, Nice, was a prosecutor in the Slobodan Milošević trial for war crimes at The Hague.  “China is one of the oldest continuous civilizations existing today and yet it faces determinations supported by evidence that would show it to be -- in part and that part its government not its people -- to be wholly wicked,” Nice said. Charles Parton, a former UK diplomat in China who participated in the tribunal, described its approach to Xinjiang-related issues as “probably the most thorough look at all the evidence.”  German scholar Adrian Zenz, who also provided testimony, called what’s happening in Xinjiang an “atrocity.” “The tribunal constitutes a people’s effort to step in where governments and multilateral institutions have failed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-guilty-of-xinjiang-genocide-independent-uk-panel-101639103248062.html
10-12-2021||World||Congressional staffer allowed into US Capitol complex with gun||A congressional staffer carrying a gun was allowed to move freely inside the US Capitol complex for several minutes on Thursday, even though an X-ray machine at a security checkpoint had picked up the weapon in his bag.The 57-year-old man told police he had left the pistol in his bag by accident but the incident nevertheless raised serious questions over security at the seat of US democracy, almost a year after the deadly January 6 insurrection.With numerous dignitaries including President Joe Biden due in the Capitol Rotunda for Republican statesman Bob Dole's memorial, the House of Representative's worker was waved through security at the Longworth office block across the road.The man, identified as Jeffrey Allsbrooks, was tracked down and detained four minutes after officers noticed the gun -- a delay roughly equivalent to the typical duration of mass shootings in the United States.The US Capitol Police issued a statement confirming that officers "spotted the image of a handgun in a bag on the X-ray screen" after the staffer had passed through security.But the force did not reveal exactly how long he had been in the building before the breach was spotted, and did not respond to a request for confirmation of media reports that the gun was loaded."Allsbrooks told our officers he forgot the gun was in the bag. We are charging him with carrying a pistol without a license," the statement said."This case remains under investigation and the department is looking into what happened before, during, and after those four minutes."LockdownThe agency sent out an alert just before 8:00 am notifying Longworth staff of a security threat and telling them to lock themselves in the nearest office and stay away from all doors and windows, or "seek cover if in a public space."Staff was prevented from entering or leaving the building during the lockdown, which was lifted after a few minutes.The arrest came with Biden preparing to pay tribute to a former Republican senator and presidential candidate, Dole, who is lying in state in the Capitol.The police have been on high alert since one of their officers died and numerous others were wounded after thousands of supporters of defeated president Donald Trump stormed the Capitol on January 6 in a bid to overturn Biden's election victory.Security was tested again on April 2 when a man rammed a car into police at a barricade outside the complex, wounding one officer.And government offices were evacuated when a motorist stopped his pickup truck outside the Library of Congress, across the road from Congress, in August and said he had explosives.A month later Capitol police arrested a man who had multiple knives, including a machete, in his truck near the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the same area.Allsbrooks didn't respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/congressional-staffer-allowed-into-us-capitol-complex-with-gun-101639103097973.html

Lithuania’s ruling coalition had agreed in November last year to support what it described as “those fighting for freedom” in Taiwan, putting its relations with China at risk.China views self-ruled and democratically governed Taiwan as its territory and has stepped up pressure on countries to downgrade or sever their relations with the island.China’s foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Thursday that China followed international trade rules and again criticised Lithuania for its stance on Taiwan.“It has created the false impression of Taiwan being separate from China, gravely harmed China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and started an egregious precedent among the international community.”Western nations would ‘pay the price’: ChinaChina warned Western nations on Thursday that they would “pay the price” for a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics as a French minister said they would not be joining the US-backed effort.Washington unveiled its decision not to send a diplomatic delegation earlier in the week, saying it was prompted by widespread rights abuses by China and what it sees as a “genocide” against the Muslim Uighur minority in Xinjiang.Australia, Britain and Canada followed suit in a flurry of diplomatic bonhomie on Wednesday.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made the announcement in Ottawa and tweeted, “Canada remains deeply disturbed by reports of human rights violations in China.“As a result, we won’t be sending diplomatic representatives to Beijing for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. We’ll continue to support our athletes who work hard to compete on the world stage.”“The US, Australia, Britain and Canada’s use of the Olympic platform for political manipulation is unpopular and self-isolating, and they will inevitably pay the price for their wrongdoing,” Wang said.Soon afterwards Beijing received welcome news from Paris, as education and sports minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said France will not join the boycott.“We need to be careful about the link between sports and politics,” Blanquer said during an interview with RMC radio and BFM television, adding France would carry on condemning human rights violations in China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lithuania-gears-up-for-china-led-biz-boycott-101639095295660.html
10-12-2021||World||WHO warns against hoarding vaccines||Wealthy countries may start to hoard Covid-19 vaccines again, threatening global supplies as they seek to shore up stocks to fight the new Omicron variant of the virus, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Thursday.The warning by the head of WHO’s department of immunisation, vaccines and biologicals, Dr Kate O’Brien, comes as supplies to the Covax dose-sharing programme run by the WHO and vaccine charity GAVI have increased in the past few months due to donations from wealthy countries and after India eased limits on exports of vaccines.“What is going to shut down disease is for everybody who is especially at risk of disease to become vaccinated,” said Dr O’Brien. “We seem to be taking our eye off that ball in countries.”Meanwhile, the WHO’s vaccine advisory panel recommends that people who are immunocompromised or received an inactivated vaccine should receive a booster dose of a Covid-19 shot, the head of the panel said on Thursday.The recommendation comes after the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunisation held a meeting on Tuesday to evaluate the need for Covid-19 boosters.Separately, the EU medicines watchdog said on Thursday the Omicron variant of coronavirus may cause milder disease.Also, European Union countries are expected to agree to limit to nine months the duration of Covid-19 certificates for travel around the bloc, three EU sources told Reuters.Johnson left reeling over Christmas party scandalBritain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday faced a political backlash for imposing new virus restrictions and public fury about whether a Downing Street Christmas party last year broke lockdown rules.Members of Johnson’s ruling Conservative party openly voiced opposition to his new guidance to work from home and the prospect of compulsory vaccine passports.Also, the number of cases of the Omicron variant in Britain has nearly doubled in one day after a further 249 cases were confirmed on Thursday, bringing the total to 817.The UK Health Security Agency said if the growth rate and doubling time continue at the rate seen in the last two weeks, they expect to see at least 50% of Covid-19 cases to be caused by Omicron variant in the next two to four weeks.Britain is also experiencing it worst ever outbreak of bird flu, farming and environment minister George Eustice told parliament on Thursday.Britain’s chief vet Christine Middlemiss told BBC Radio on Thursday that around 500,000 birds had been culled as a result of at least 36 outbreaks.The US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday expanded authorisation of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid booster to include 16- and 17-year-olds, amid growing concern over the Omicron variant’s ability to overcome immunity conferred by two shots.Denmark’s PM defends decision to cull minksDenmark’s PM Mette Fredriksen insisted on Thursday she did not know her government’s decision last year in November to cull 15-17mn minks over fears of a new coronavirus strain was unlawful.Austria plans to impose fines of up to around $4,000 on people who flout a vaccine mandate it aims to introduce in February for all residents age 14 and over, the health minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-against-hoarding-vaccines-101639094743485.html

He said about 40 injured had serious wounds and were taken to local hospitals. Later, the death toll in the Mexico road accident was revised to 53.That meant at least 107 people were crowed into the vehicle. It is not unusual for freight trucks in Mexico to be carrying so many people in migrant-smuggling operations in southern Mexico.The crash occurred on a highway leading toward the Chiapas state capital. Photos from the scene showed victims strewn across the pavement and inside the truck's freight compartment.The victims appeared to be immigrants from Central America, though their nationalities had not yet been confirmed. Moreno reported that some of the survivors said they were from the neighboring country of Guatemala.Moreno said that it appeared the sheer weight of the truck's human cargo may have caused it to tip over and that as the vehicle toppled over it hit the base of a steel pedestrian bridge.In recent months, Mexican authorities have tried to block migrants from walking in large groups toward the U.S. border, but the clandestine and illicit flow of migrant smuggling has continued.In October, in one of the largest busts in recent memory, authorities in the northern border state of Tamaulipas found 652 mainly Central American migrants jammed into a convoy of six freight trucks heading toward the U.S. border.Migrants involved in serious accidents are often allowed to stay in Mexico at least temporarily because they are considered witnesses to and victims of a crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/49-migrants-killed-dozens-injured-in-mexico-truck-crash-report-101639093948384.html

Still, most Chileans now support same-sex marriage and have shown signs of becoming more liberal on social and cultural issues in recent years.Civil unions have been permitted in Chile since 2015, which affords same-sex partners many but not all the benefits of married couples, like the right to adoption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-love-relationships-on-equal-footing-says-chile-prez-brings-law-to-legalise-same-sex-marriage-101639073714483.html
